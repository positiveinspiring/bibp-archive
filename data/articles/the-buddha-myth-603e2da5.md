According to tradition, the founder of Buddhism
was a Hindu named Siddhattha, son of the rajah of the Sakyan clan
which dwelt in the foothills of the Himalayas.
He is sometimes referred to as a Sakyamuni
(muni meaning Sage), sometimes as Tathagata (literally "One who has
come, or gone, This Far"), more usually as Gotama Buddha. The term
Buddha is a title, not a personal name. Gotama is referred to as
the Buddha after his Enlightenment, which is reputed to have occurred in 528
B.C. in Bihar.
Thereafter he abandoned family life and
promulgated his doctrine of deliverance from suffering and attainment of
ultimate peace, Nirvana.
His teaching is called the Dhamma (Sanskrit
Dharma), and is summed up in the
Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path....
There were many sects and sages in India 2500 years ago, but their teachings
were transmitted orally. The Buddhist Dhamma was not written down for
centuries after it had been first enunciated. The various Sanskrit and Pali
texts which purport to contain the original teachings are therefore the
product of evolution, and it is impossible to say which of the divergent
interpretations, if any, represents the pristine form.
What is quite certain is that the underlying
philosophy had a great deal in common with ideas prevalent at the time. It
bears some resemblance to the contemporary
Jainist movement.
The breakaway from Hindu ritualism was not a unique innovation; neither was
there anything new in the founding of an order of monks. Various sects were
already organized as mendicant monks, and it was an established custom for
them to meet periodically and proclaim their teaching in public. The early
Buddhists followed this familiar pattern.
They made modifications, of course, and one
feature was the rejection of the severe austerities which were practiced by
some of the sects.
The Series of Buddha
Not only have we no six-century record of the rules of the Buddhist
Sangha, as the order was called, but it did not claim to be a new
teaching. The tradition holds that it had been promulgated many times before
- that Gotama was only one of a long series of Buddhas who arise at
intervals and who all teach the same doctrine.
The names of twenty-four of such Buddhas
who appeared before Gotama have been recorded. The number and names
may well be late inventions, but there can be no question about the belief
in their existence. It was held that after the death of each Buddha, his
religion flourishes for a time and then decays.
After it is forgotten, a new Buddha emerges and
preaches the lost Dhamma, or Truth. In the fourth century A.D., a sect of
Buddhists rejected Gotama and venerated instead the three previous
Buddhas. They especially reverenced one of them,
Kasyapa, and were actually joined in by the
orthodox in worship as his tomb.
It seems quite probable in the light of these facts that any number of
teachings attributed to "the Buddha" may have been in existence either
before or at the time when Gotama was believed to have lived. They
might all have been attributed to a sage with the title of "the Blessed
One." They might include teachings that were ascribed later to Gotama.
The name Gotama is a common one; it is also full of mythological
associations. There was admittedly another Gotama known to the early
Buddhists, who founded an order.
So what proof is there that the sayings and
doings of different Gotamas may not have been ascribed to one person?...
The Documentary Evidence
...Looking then, for a foothold among the shifting sands of Buddhist
tradition we note the following clashing records:
-
The Buddha is represented in ostensibly
early and late tradition as speaking of the Gods with full belief in
their existence.
-
He is represented on the one hand as
discouraging sacrifices, and on the other as prescribing for a whole
tribe a strict adherence to ancient rites.
-
King Asoka, who figured as a good
Buddhist in the early vigor of the movement, about 250 B.C.,
habitually called himself "the delight of the Gods" as did his
contemporary, the pious Buddhist king of Ceylon.
-
The Buddha is represented as throwing
his Order open to all classes and at the same time making the name
"Brahmin" a term of honor for his Arahats and saints. Brahmins were
among the most distinguished disciples.
-
On the principle that Buddha delivered
the whole cannon, much teaching that certainly did not come from him
is ascribed to him.
-
Much of the philosophy set forth as his
teaching is identical with the Sankhya system, germs of which are
admittedly pre-Buddhistic.
What doctrines, it must now be asked, were
special to Buddhism? Not Karma, that was common property which
Buddhism shared.
Not in asserting that a right mind was superior
to sacrifice, that was a primary doctrine of the Jains, and pre-Buddhistic,
both within and without the pale of Brahmanism. Not in seeking a way to
salvation independently of the Vedas, that had been done by many teachers in
various sects. Not in the doctrine that defilement comes not from unclean
meats but from evil deeds and words and thoughts; Buddhist writers
themselves say that is derived from previous Buddhas.
Not in the search for peace through self-control
and renunciation; that was the quest of a myriad recluses and all previous
Buddhas. Not in the view that there is a higher wisdom than that attained by
austerities; that, too, is pre-Buddhistic. Not in the doctrine that
non-Brahmans could join an Order and attain religious blessedness; other
orders were open to men of low social status and even to slaves.
Indeed, the rigid separation of caste was not
yet established in the early days of Buddhism. Brahmin claims were
exorbitantly high, but many Brahmins waived them and they did not apply to
ascetics. Early Buddhists, like the early Christians, did not admit
runaway slaves to the Order.
The admission of women was not an innovation as it was practiced by the
Jains, and even the tradition makes the Buddha accept it reluctantly in the
twenty-fifth year of his preaching.
There seems, in short, to be nothing on the face
of the doctrine to account for the expansion of the Buddhist movement....
Buddha as a Secondary God
We can now make a critical assessment of Buddhist origins. The Teaching
Buddha, considered as the wondrous sage who established a great Order in
his lifetime, shrinks to vanishing point.
The suspicion that
Sakyamuni is an unreal being is
finally justified.
The Order probably originated among ascetic
Brahmins who may have been led to rationalism as a result of renouncing the
Vedas....
Objections Answered
It is reasonable to wonder why so many scholars, while admitting the tissue
of fable and unplausible history surrounding the origins of Buddhism,
nevertheless still believe that Sakyamuni actually existed.
They usually justify their attitude by the
argument that every sect must have had a founder. This assumption can be
allowed if it is merely taken to mean that someone must have begun the
formation of any given group. It is clearly not true in the sense that every
sect originates in the new teaching of a remarkable personage.
As we have seen, there was in all probability a group of heretical
Brahmanists for whom a Buddha signified "the enlightened one." Even so,
there were many Buddhas before the quasi-historical Buddha had acquired a
personality, like the slain Jesus of the Pauline Epistles....
A sufficient nucleus for the Buddha lay in the general Brahmanic concept of
"Buddhas." There is even a tradition that at the time when Sakyamuni came,
many men ran about saying "I am the Buddha"...
On these grounds it is submitted that the figure of the Buddha, in its most
plausibly rationalized form, is as unhistorical as that of the gospel Jesus.
Each figure shows how the religious mind manufactured a myth in a period in
which the making of primary Gods had given way to the making of
Secondary-gods.
The mythopoeic process satisfied the craving for
a Teacher-god who should originate religious and moral ideas as the earlier
gods had been held to originate agriculture, art, medicine, law and
civilization.
Buddhism, like Christianity, is a "failure" from the point of view
of its traditional origins.
In the case of Burma it admittedly did more to
mold the life of the whole people towards its highest ethic than
Christianity ever did; but in India, where it arose, it collapsed utterly.
It was overthrown by Brahmanism which set up in its place a revived
polytheism.
On our naturalistic view of the rise of the Teaching-gods, it is sheer human
aspiration that has shaped all the Christs and their doctrines.
One reason why the original teachings fail is
that men persisted in crediting purely human aspiration to supernatural
beings. Men who are taught to bow ethically to a divine Teacher are not
taught ethically to think. Any aspiration so evoked is factitious, verbal,
emotional, not reached by authentic thought and experience.
When the wisdom or unwisdom of the nameless
thinkers in all ages is recognized for what it is - as human and not divine
- the nations may become capable of working out for themselves better
gospels than the best of those which turned to naught in their hands while
they held them as revelations from the skies.
