Oil discussion by participants at the May 1973 Bilderberg Conference. Here the price of $10-12.50 a barrel is discussed for the first time. Eight months later on1st January 1974, a second oil price "shock" hit the world and saw the price of crude leap to $11.65 per barrel, following the demand of America's mid-east "puppet" the Shah of Iran. It is quite certain that the Shah would not have forced the price rise without US support. It is believed the Shah was ordered to do so by Dr. Henry Kissinger.
