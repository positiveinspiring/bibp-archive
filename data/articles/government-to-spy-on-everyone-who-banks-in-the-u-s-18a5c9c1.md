The excuse given for this intrusion on
privacy?
As with the
destruction of all of our privacies and other liberties, the excuse
given is terrorism.
Indeed, given that the government claims the
right to
assassinate or indefinitely detain Americans without any due process of
law, do you think government employees will hesitate in seizing the
assets of Americans labels as enemies?
The government has
done it before, and President Obama
authorized seizure of property again last year.
And the governments take-down of Megaupload
was an exercise of the power to
seize all of the legal property held in a storage facility
because a handful of crooks have illegal property in theirs.

U.S. to Let Spy Agencies...
Scour Americans' Finances

The
Obama administration is
drawing up plans to give all U.S. spy agencies full access to a massive
database that contains financial data on American citizens and others
who bank in the country, according to a Treasury Department document
seen by Reuters.
The proposed plan represents a major step by U.S. intelligence agencies
to spot and track down terrorist networks and crime syndicates by
bringing together financial databanks, criminal records and military
intelligence. The plan, which legal experts say is permissible under
U.S. law, is nonetheless likely to trigger intense criticism from
privacy advocates.
Financial institutions that operate in the United States are required by
law to file reports of "suspicious customer activity," such as large
money transfers or unusually structured bank accounts, to Treasury's
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).
The Federal Bureau of Investigation already has full access to the
database.
However, intelligence agencies, such as the
Central
Intelligence Agency and the
National Security Agency, currently have to make case-by-case
requests for information to FinCEN.
The Treasury plan would give spy agencies the ability to analyze more
raw financial data than they have ever had before, helping them look for
patterns that could reveal attack plots or criminal schemes.
The planning document, dated March 4, shows that the proposal is still
in its early stages of development, and it is not known when
implementation might begin.
Financial institutions file more than 15 million "suspicious activity
reports" every year, according to Treasury.
Banks, for instance, are required to report
all personal cash transactions exceeding $10,000, as well as suspected
incidents of money laundering, loan fraud, computer hacking or
counterfeiting.
"For these reports to be of value in
detecting money laundering, they must be accessible to law
enforcement, counter-terrorism agencies, financial regulators, and
the intelligence community," said the Treasury planning document.
A Treasury spokesperson said U.S. law
permits FinCEN to share information with intelligence agencies to help
detect and thwart threats to national security, provided they adhere to
safeguards outlined in the Bank Secrecy Act.
"Law enforcement and intelligence
community members with access to this information are bound by these
safeguards," the spokesperson said in a statement.
Some privacy watchdogs expressed concern
about the plan when Reuters outlined it to them.
A move like the FinCEN proposal,
"raises concerns as to whether people
could find their information in a file as a potential terrorist
suspect without having the appropriate predicate for that and find
themselves potentially falsely accused," said Sharon Bradford
Franklin, senior counsel for the Rule of Law Program at the
Constitution Project, a non-profit watchdog group.
Despite these concerns, legal experts
emphasize that this sharing of data is permissible under U.S. law.
Specifically, banks' suspicious activity
reporting requirements are dictated by a combination of the Bank Secrecy
Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, which offer some privacy safeguards.
National security experts also maintain that a robust system for sharing
criminal, financial and intelligence data among agencies will improve
their ability to identify those who plan attacks on the United
States.
"It's a war on money, war on corruption,
on politically exposed persons, anti-money laundering, organized
crime," said Amit Kumar, who advised the United Nations on Taliban
sanctions and is a fellow at the Democratic think tank Center for
National Policy.
SUSPICIOUS
ACTIVITY
The Treasury document outlines a proposal to link the FinCEN database
with a computer network used by U.S. defense and law enforcement
agencies to share classified information called the Joint Worldwide
Intelligence Communications System.
The plan calls for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence -
set up after 9/11 to foster greater collaboration among intelligence
agencies - to work with Treasury. The Director of National Intelligence
declined to comment.
More than 25,000 financial firms - including banks, securities dealers,
casinos, and money and wire transfer agencies - routinely file
"suspicious activity reports" to FinCEN. The requirements for filing are
so strict that banks often over-report, so they cannot be accused of
failing to disclose activity that later proves questionable.
This over-reporting raises the possibility
that the financial details of ordinary citizens could wind up in the
hands of spy agencies.
Stephen Vladeck, a professor at American University's Washington
College of Law, said privacy advocates have already been pushing back
against the increased data-sharing activities between government
agencies that followed the
September 11 attacks.
"One of the real pushes from the civil
liberties community has been to move away from collection
restrictions on the front end and put more limits on what the
government can do once it has the information," he said.
