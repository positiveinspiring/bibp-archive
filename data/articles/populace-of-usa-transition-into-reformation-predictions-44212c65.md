# Populace of USA - Transition Into Reformation - Predictions

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_bigcrash106.htm

The latest data sets for the Populace/USofA* entity are clearly indicating a
[break (with the) past] that will be arriving very close to the vernal
equinox (March 21 - usually). This [break (with the) past] is filled with
language about the [dollar death], and from the point of view of the data in
these future days of Spring 2011, the [dollar death] language is focused on
the [morbidity (while standing) at home].
* Populace/USofA
Proxy for the populace of the USofA. Defined broadly and representative
of issues which rise to national prominence.
The supporting data in this sub
set has the view that the [dollar] as [global reserve currency] has already
[died (and is buried/discarded)]. From these supporting sets comes the view
of the [dollar] as [internal currency] being in [severe distress] within the
[national economic infrastructure].
The data accretion patterns, that begin in late February, and ramp up
rapidly through early March, are *the* dominant component to [national
(expressions) of daily life] here in the USofA by mid Summer. The longer
term data values show a continuation of the [destruction (of civil life)]
and [collective history] through all of Summer, Fall, and into the Winter of
2011/2012.
The [destruction of civil life] sub set contains repeated references to
[civil unrest] and [riots], as well as [armed insurrection]. This last is
cross linked extensively to the TPTW and Markets entities. Within the
[destruction of civil life] sub set are the previously described (in past
ALTA reports) instances of [mob action] that results in the [burning alive]
of [minions] and ['power elites'] and their [families].
The HOLE incident
will act as a [spark] to [spreading contagion] {ed note: from the words
to-be-used by the political minions} that is indicated to
[start a riot] in
an [urban area (north of DC)] that will itself [spread like fire]. The data
sets are showing a lot of support for the [riots] sub set through Spring and
Summer, but the [mother of all riots] does not appear within our data sets
until later in HOLE.
At that time the inclemency of the [weather] has
cleared, and the [spark] begun then [leaps] across [state boundaries] and
[spreads out (through the) corridors]. These act as [viaducts] that in turn
take the [riot] from [population center ] to [population center] such that
the [minions] and [officialdom] are [unable] to [comprehend] the
[manifesting developments].
That is, they just don't get it. By the time of
the [mother of riots], many individual incidents of [civil disobedience],
[riots], [planned civil actions] and other [innovative protest arts] have
dominated the [media (including some reports on the MSM (mainstream
media) but far more within
alternative media)] over Spring and Summer.
The primary motivators coming
from the supporting sets, including the detail layers, point toward the
[hyper inflation of food prices], the [lack of work], the [massive
lay-offs], the [collapse of
the banking systems], the [sporadic electrical
outages lasting for days], the [empty food shelves], the [worthless
'vouchers/cards' for money from gov't]. The data has numerous details of
diverse descriptors all of which pretty much lumped under [we're broke,
we're hungry, we've been raped, and we are pissed].
The [we've been raped]
meme arises from supporting sets going to the idea of the [rape of social
security], and the [rape of retirements] that TPTW and their [minions] are
going to accomplish through [hyper inflation] over late Winter
(2010/2011) and early Spring (2011). The [beggaring of the populace]
will be accompanied by [reports of die-offs] that will continue for
months.
It may take a few
months before the [propaganda press outlets] begin to report the actual
levels, however the data sets indicate that the [populace] will be [aware]
of the trend.
This [dying at the fringes (of health, society, capacity)] is
in the supporting sets that provide for [mental pressures] on a [moment by
moment] basis that is in support of the [madness of mobs] sub set which
feeds the [riots] sub set.
Of note is that previously described (in past ALTA reports) [riots in
Maryland] in which the [exposure] of [secret underground bases] occurs is
now filling rapidly. The [starving mob riots] here in the USofA in which
[governmental infrastructure] is [located and looted] are also temporally
linked to [starvation riots] that will [sweep through] Italy and [break out
into the open].
The [starvation riots] throughout [[europe] have been
described in previous reports as leading to a [pitched battle] that will
[crash through] the [minions of the sorcerers (swiss guard)] and lead to the
[looting of the palace of the sorcerers (vatican)].
As in the descriptors
for the [liberation of foods] from the [deep
underground bases] in [maryland],
the [liberation of the vatican] will also tangentially expose the [secret
shadow government]. In both instances the data sets indicate that [texts]
and [photographs] and [videos] that have been [long hidden (by the minions)]
will become [public property] at a [planetary level].
Note that the number of [retrieved] or [recovered] sub sets in support of
[information] and the [public domain] rise exponentially as we move forward
from Spring through Summer. The number of [releases] of [once hidden
information] during this time, and in spite of the [global chaos] of [food
shortages] and [crashing currencies] and [collapsing governments], is
indicated to lead directly to [back yard/garage/apartment researchers] to
make [rapid progress] in both [devices] and [methods] across a wide range of
interests.
Should terran humanity make it through these next few years, it
will be the [exposures] and [liberation of knowledge] that takes place in
the chaos of the [food riots of 2011] that will act as the catalyst for the
[technical renaissance] of the species. This interpretation is based on the
assumption that the [hidden civilization] that grew from the [american
national security state] on last century does not decide to [emerge] and
[expose themselves]...no not that way.
There are a number of data sets that
can be interpreted as describing [chaos] across the planet that is so
widespread and [disruptive to necessary supplies] that it [forces the
unveiling] of the [hidden civilization] in this year. It is worth noting
that even if this interpretation does manifest, it will be the [food riots]
and resulting [governmental collapse] that triggers the [hidden
civilization] to try a [planetary take over].
The impacts of the [dollar currency collapse] are showing as reaching
[visibility] within the [main stream media (aka propaganda press)] by March,
but reported with a focus on the [symptoms] rather than the [diseases
(parasitism by the hidden civilization and corruption by minions/tptw)].
Without regard to their [reports] at that time, the [propaganda press] will
find that it is being [attacked] in ways both [personal] and [collective].
The [beat upon press minions] will be so [taken aback] at being [taken out
back for a beating] that they will [alter] how [reporting] and
[presentation] of [officialdom propaganda, aka 'teevee news'] occurs in the
USofA. There are several such incidents that will make the [alternative
media headlines] over late March and escalating through Spring, and Summer.
The data sets in support of the [death of the dollar] theme in the Populace/USofA
entity are large, and dominating, and growing through much of 2011.
The idea
coming across is of a [twisting (in agony)], and [suspended (in morass)] as
the [population] tries to work through the [grief process]. Beginning with
the [hyperinflation of food prices] at the [retail level] {ed note: likely
within 3/three weeks of this report publication} and at a [regional level],
the [dollar death woes] begin to [impinge] upon the limited conscious mind
time of the 'average citizen' {ed note: aka 'sheeple'}.
The data indicates
that once the process of [intrusion (of dollar demise/hunger)} begins, there
will be two simultaneously spreading effects: first, a triggering of a more
general [awakening (to manifesting circumstance -aka reality)] within the 'sheeple
herd', and second, the rise in [visibility] of many, if not most, of the
[woo-woo educators] specifically, and members of the wujo generally.
Stated
another way, once the [shock] of the [recognition of fundamental change]
occurs as a direct result of dollar death woes producing changes in daily
life, the leading edge of the vast herd of sheeple will attempt to [self
educate].
This natural response to a [dissolving] and [no longer able to be
supported] view of [reality], is indicated to [propel] the general levels of
[visibility] of the [wujo] to [dizzying heights].
Hmmmmm... pee camels on
the O channel? Maybe so, strange damn universe apparently intent on
surprising us all.
The [dollar death] linguistic structure has grown
remarkably over this last data collection period. The primary supporting
sub set array is 4/four hundred percent larger than we left it, and
similar levels of growth have overlaid the secondary and tertiary
support layers, and even larger growth rates within the detail layers.
The projections for the growth of language
in the [propaganda press aka mainstream media] around the [dollar death]
meme should also grow as robustly from late January through to March, where
upon the language will begin to manifest [locally (within the USofA)] as the
[dollar death] moves from the former concern of [death (as global reserve
currency)] to [internal use].
The [dollar death] meme also has a number of
aspect/attribute sets in support of the secondary layers that go to the idea
of [claims] that will be [pressed] on the [minions] at [all financial
levels] and through [lawsuits] from [foreign shores] that will be
[simultaneous] with the [internal corruption (of the dollar)] which is also
supporting the [coagulation (of flow sources)] into what is described as
[rigor mortis].
As with all our work, when we encounter archetypes of this
nature, we tend to take that area of the model very seriously as body parts
are very core level archetypes in human language. We also have [post death
tremors] and [shaking (in the veins)] along with [purging] and [bowels
release], and [violent puking].
Many of these descriptors have appeared in
previous reports throughout 2010, and now continued support appears with
temporal markers for manifesting around [withdrawal (of dollar as foreign
reserve)]. Now that these language sets have begun to manifest in the
[propaganda press], the temporal markers have been reached.
These markers
were indicated to be within the leading edge of the shorter term value sets,
and so this language about [dollar death (within the USofA)] are likely to
begin appearing within 3/three months, or, coincidentally, just about the
time of the vernal equinox (aka Springtime).
The detail sets for the [dollar death] internal to the [populace/usofa] show
a wide variety of effects ranging from [violence] to [stupefaction
(disbelief)]. Of a curious note is that the data accretion patterns for
these aspect/attribute sets are showing that a [calm period], what can also
be described as the [grasping, gasping time] will exist for [several days]
after the [initial crash] of the [dollar built structures].
The patterns
show that the [populace/usofa] will have a bit of a [freak out], and then
something of a [hold fast] as the [national mood] goes toward [assessment].
This [shake it, bake it, and taste it] period in which the [populace/usofa]
will be [dazed and confused]. The accretion patterns continue thereafter
with aspect/attributes of [return], and [home bound] that are in support of
the [diaspora] sub set. The detail layers are pointing toward something of a
[shock] for TPTW and [officialdom minions] as the [populace] decides to [get
along home (wherever that may be)].
This [general relocation] is, from the
point of view of the [political minions (and their masters)], both
[unexpected], and [beyond control]. The [minion class] sub sets sum up to
some rather high levels of [anxiety] and [disruption (to plans)] around this
[relocation of the masses]. Note that a lot of the [masses] will be
[children returning from schools] and other [institutions].
This sub set is
but one component in supporting the [diaspora] archetype growth in the
Populace/USofA entity for 2011.
With many of the [social disorder] sub sets being 'fed' by the [death of the
dollar] creating [famine] and [food shortages] as well as [destroyed
stores], it would be easy to assume that the [dollar] would be the primary
problem facing the Populace/USofA, however, sadly, that is not to be the
case.
A hint arises from the sheer number of cross links between the
Populace/USofA entity and the Terra entity. The level of cross links between
the [social disease] and [social order disruption] in the Populace/USofA
entity and the [destructive weather] in the Terra entity has never been this
extreme.
The Populace/USofA entity provides the descriptors for the impacts
while the Terra entity contributes the descriptors of the 'causal' events.
Apparently one of the most destructive events will be a [series] of
[floods]. These [floods] are described as being [food supplies] impacting
for [several generations]. There are repeated references to [multiple flood
centers] and each is also defined as a [center (for) (some form of) crop
production].
The impact levels for the [flood] archetype separated out to USofA geographic references goes out [4/four generations or 84 years]. The
[flood] linguistic here has supporting sets that describe the sites as being
[never flood], and [first time ever], as well as [speech (in shock) over the
pictures]. There are several descriptor sets within the supporting
aspect/attribute groups that describe [high/dry hills] that will be on video
[enfolding (the) flood].
These [hills] are further described as [scarred] by
the [rain/deluge] that sets up the [flood] conditions. The details include
descriptors for [boat rescues], and [lines (of fleeing) humans ]. These
details paint a picture of [long lines] of [humans fleeing up (steep) hills]
and [chaining themselves together] to [overcome obstacles].
The [chains of
fleeing people] will also be in [conjunction with] the [flight of animals]
of all kinds.
Some of the [flood] descriptor sets also include support for [earthquakes]
and [earthquake damages] that are also contributory to the [impact levels
(of the) floods]. These [earthquake] sets are dwarfed by the Terra entity
[earthquake] sets, so that entity needs to be taken into account, but there
are nonetheless, significant sets pointing to [earthquakes] that
[precipitate damages] that in turn [cause] some [flooding], and [exacerbate]
other [floods] already in place.
Note that these [floods] within the Populace/USofA entity are also
extensively cross linked internally to the [diaspora] sub set as well as
being also externally cross linked to the GlobalPop entity where the
terminating sets also include the [diaspora] archetype.
The [floods] sub set includes aspect/attributes for several [communities] in
which [critical infrastructure (such as hospitals/fire stations/law
enforcement buildings)] being [swept away], and [encapsulated (in) mud].
Some of these linguistic sets are reminiscent of the language we saw that
allowed us to forecast the Katrina hurricane disaster.
There are 4/four sets
located so far that have sums for impact (damage levels) that are higher
than we had prior to Katrina. Not only do the descriptor sets contain the
'usual' kind of [disaster] language such as [buildings collapsing] and
[levees failing], but also there are sets that contain [(insanity producing)
gas releases] and [toxic waste contamination] and [contamination by fuel
spills (of magnitude)].
There are further descriptors which portray
[airports] that are [under water], and [port facilities] with [only rooftops
showing].
These [floods] are also part of a [soon-to-be-revealed secret plan] {ed
note: details come out in documents liberated during Spring rioting in the
north of the country} to [depopulate] certain parts of [north america] for
[(unknown to us pie eaters) reasons (of TPTW)]. These areas are extensively
cross linked over to the GlobalPop entity where they terminate in sets with
predominantly Mexico, and Gulf Central America geographic references.
Thus
the interpretation is that TPTW had a plan to [shift (or kill off?) the
populace] of a large portion of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) region for their own
purposes. Parts of the [diaspora] descriptor set within the Populace/USofA
entity are pointing to a [permanent (form of) relocation] affecting the
[southern USA from FL through TX] and [eastern Mexico] as a direct result of
Springtime events in the GOM region in 2011.
The [floods] sub sets in both
the Populace/USofA entity and the Terra entity suggest that [climate change]
and [tainting (after the flood)] will be mixed in with [regional economic
(and energy?) collapse] such that an [officialdom called/announce] form of [diaspora]
will be attempted. Please note that the [refuseniks] of this 2011 [official
diaspora] will end up forming the core of the regional population discussed
as the [coastal nomads (a water based culture)] in FuturePop entity
discussions in past ALTA reports.
These [refuseniks] who are the [first
generation] of this [errant populace (from the viewpoint of TPTB/W)] will
make their first appearance this year according to both TPTB/W entity and
the Populace/USofA entity. The [visibility] values are high, but the span is
brief, so it would seem that the [msm (mainstream media = propaganda press)]
will only touch the story before being 'waved off' by their masters.
Nonetheless, there are corresponding sub sets suggesting that the
[visibility] itself will gain some [visibility] within the [alternative
media] as the [refuseniks] will be [self seen], and apparently rather
pleased with their [piece of pie performance (art?)] {ed note: hint for
then, not now.}
Also note that the [refuseniks] will have a very [rough time] in the
beginning with [high casualty rates], but that as with all new skills, the
[learning curve], while steep, can also be [rapid]. The data sets indicate
that [diaspora refuseniks] will become something of their own [hidden
civilization legend] over these next few years.
However, as with so much of
2011, at least according to our data accretion patterns, the
[weather/climate change] is still the [defining test] of [success] this
year. The [refuseniks] make their [start] under conditions that suggest
Katrina/Rita (at least as far as flooding) was mere preparatory rehearsal.
Other imagery includes [bridges (under water)] and [bridges (washed away)].
There are several sets in support that show [desert (including hills)] that
will be [underwater]. There are supporting sets for, ironically, a [boat
show] that will be [adrift] and [underwater/sunk]. There are {ed note: oh
the horror of it all!} many references to [sports seasons disrupted]
including language for [cancellations (of rest of season?)].
It becomes
difficult to guess which of the many influences will be the nominal causal
factor, but the data shows that [professional sports (and other big name
entertainment events)] will be [impacted by floods], as well as [dollar
death], and [sudden bankruptcy], and [failed (transportation) routes].
That
this shows up at all is itself significant in that the whole archetype of
[entertainment (as a mind control industry here in USA and exported to the
rest of the planet)] is showing as under [great stress] due to [disruptions]
in areas such as [dollar death], [transportation], {ed note: including some
upcoming high profile 'stranding'}, and [delivery of product].
This last
includes some sub sets that cross link over to the [dysfunction of space
story] sub set in the SpaceGoatFarts* entity.
* SpaceGoatFarts (SGF)
This entity is newly formed. While references to Space Goat Farts have
appeared within Terra, sub set Space in the past, the data set now
demonstrates a need for an entity to allow for the growth of 'unknown
forces of all kinds from space which are terra/populace affecting'.
Includes non-earth based, non-human/non-mammal intelligent beings
usually considered as 'space aliens' or 'extraterrestrials'.
Created during 1207 clean up.
The stressors on the
[entertainment/mind control media] and their [content delivery] are showing
as being more acute in the last half of 2011, but with a few such incidents
of a [high visibility] in the first half.
The real problems for the whole of
the [content production] side of [entertainment/mind control] will be
[escalating] right along with the [dollar death problems] from mid February
onward. This set of descriptors is also cross linked to the GlobalPop where
the [good (brief) days] for the [woowoo guys] sub sets are the termination
points.
Apparently the lack of the usual [mind numbing entertainment
offerings] opens up some new parts of the population to [alternative media].
As if the [floods] and [death of the federal reserve note as currency] was
not [ enough to guarantee a [bad year] for the [american populace], the data
sets continue to indicate that the [bad food] sub set is not only connected
to [derivatives] going [foul/rotten] in early 2011. While some of the data
sets would seem to point to the [press (msm) = propagandists] 'reporting'
that the [bad food] incidents of 2011 in the [usofa populace] will be the
[result] of [death of the dollar via impact on officialdom spending to
'protect' the populace], the data argues against that as being an accurate
conclusion.
Rather the accretion patterns of the continuing stream of
aspect/attribute sets point toward [necessary (or natural?) part of process
(of movement) into extremes] with details that clarify this to be a pointer
to the 'natural' tendency of cycles to reach [extremes] of [behaviors], and
then to collapse or [coagulate] such that the next phase of the cycle can
continue.
Note that this is actually how officialdom operates in the 'wild',
in that they allow corruption to become a gradual process and, not being
checked by counter processes, the system itself becomes corrupt, and then
[chokes] on the 'natural' result of total corruption which is [melt down].
The data sets in the Populace/USofA entity are indicating that a [melt down]
in the [foods delivery system], {ed note: planned? By TPTW? Or not? Little
difference at the receiving end.} will [accentuate/augment] the [economic]
[chaos] of Spring 2011.
The [melt down (defrosting?)] supporting sets
include descriptors for [mass poisoning], that is in its turn supported by
detail layers indicating the [mass poisoning episode] is so large as to
[impact national health care system], which by the way will also be in deep
trouble as the sudden [hyperinflation] over takes the more steady, and
recent, inflation in the health care infrastructure.
The [bad foods] episode
is also forecast to [bite] the [jaw] of the [political minions] at many
different levels, as the [scandals] start to [rise upward] in the [political
'power' structure]. The data suggests that [revenge attacks] may take place
against [officialdom] and [minions] thought to be responsible.
We note that without regard to the [bespoke cause] of the [attacks], the
data suggests that what has been an already [violent] year, will become even
more so as the many pressures on the [populace/usofa] pop through the
[tenuous grasp] that many humans have on [daily reality]. The larger
archetypes within the Populace/USofA entity are all extensively cross linked
over to supporting sets that terminate in [violent attacks].
It would seem
from the linguistic structures that the TPTW are not, at least [initially],
too concerned with the [rise] in [attacks against officialdom]. That
attitude seems to change as 2011 progresses from nasty to shitty.
The [bad foods] and [mass poisoning] are without any meaningful numeric
quantifiers. It is not possible, from this vantage point, to know how
extensively the [bad news (about former = already digested) foods] becomes,
but the data begins in the shorter term value sets and continues to gain
supporting layers from the longer term values so the conclusion is that the
results of the [mass poisonings], at the [society] level, will continue for
at least a year if not two.
The [fragile (grasp) on reality] for [great numbers (of the) populace] as
the [federal reserve banksters cabal] finds itself [under attack], both
[economically] and [physically]. The data sets are indicating that [actual
assassinations (at least) attempts] on [banksters] including [hidden bank
hands/owners].
These [bankster whack offs] are showing [visibility] levels
that are high, but will also be competing with [assassination attempts] on
[politicians] across the nation. The [walls of fire] sub sets from previous
ALTA reports are still building supporting aspect/attributes and now are
encompassing the [politicians] as well as the [bank criminals].
Much of the more negative value sets within the over all trend of building
tension values for the Populace/USofA entity over 2011 {ed note: right up to
yet another release language tipping point in October of 2011} rise from the
general [archetype] of the [revolution] meta data layer.
This layer has been
growing since early 2002, and continues to do so, however in 2011, the
growth shifts over to manifestation.
The [revolution] meta data layer and
the [revolution] archetype both are gaining large levels of supporting sets
from late January through to late Fall of this year. In mid Summer of 2011,
the growth rates of the [revolution] sub set become heavily cross linked
over to the SpaceGoatFarts entity where many of the terminating sub sets are
in the [unknown energies from space] descriptor set.
These terminating
aspect/attribute sets also include sets for both [officially denied] and
[unknown (phenomenon)]. In both of these sets the aspect/attribute sets at
the detail level suggest that [falls (rains) of space debris] and
[completely (indescribable) unknown atmospheric phenomena] will also
[manifest] over [american populace].
Hmmm....civilization 1/One about to
make its appearance? These [officially denied phenomena] also add to the
rising levels of tensions affecting the [populace/usofa].
The cross links to
the SpaceGoatFarts entity from the Populace/USofA entity in mid Summer 2011
are a very good temporal marker that will likely be very [visible].
Thereafter the [revolution] archetype shifts the bulk of its growing support
levels into manifestation language. The [revolution] meta data layer has
been growing steadily since 2002 in the ALTA and Shape reports and is
indicated to shift over to manifestation in 2011 and beyond.
Likely as
incidents of [violence against banksters and politicians] escalate over
2011, the [culture] of [violence] seen in the media will be [examined] at a
[national] level. However much the [visibility] of such a move, the data
shows that nothing comes of it due to more [pressing circumstances] that
will include the [opening] of [vision] about the [identities] of
[responsible parties] for the [misery] globally.
Without regard to the extensive cross links to the SpaceGoatFarts entity,
the [revolution] archetype contributes a great deal of the building tension
values. The growth rate for these [revolution] influenced emotional tension
values escalate rapidly beginning in mid February with the next phase of the
[global economic collapse].
Again to the point of depressing repetition, the
[dollar death] sub set, in early 2011, manifests in such a manner as to
[dramatically] affect the [larger (mostly unaware) populace]. As the
[economic shifts] inexorably [crush] the [populace] due to the [death of the
dollar], the [revolution] meme rises in emotional sums and gains new
supporting sets.
These include the rather now mundane [physical assaults]
against [banksters], and others of [ill repute], but also these sets include
a number of intriguing cross links suggesting something of an [internal
struggle] within the [shadow government/hidden civilization] that will start
to manifest itself in a [string] of [interconnected social anomalies].
These
[anomalies] are indicated to occasionally have rather high [visibility] sums
and to make it to the
msm = propaganda press, as the [propaganda press] is
shown as being pig ignorant about the nature of what they are reporting.
Some of these reports may include descriptions of [sudden disappearances (of
large) commodities stores] such as 'disappearing (thousands of gallons) of
molasses'. That sort of thing.
Some of the indicators also point to whole
[train cars] being [silently removed]....hmmmm? Rum and peach pie?
Have to
watch these fellows.....
The forecast bird and fishes die off (posted in
ALTA 1309 report in mid 2009
with the very early 2011 timeframe as a target for manifestation), has
brought a number of questions to the fore.
Some conclusions can (maybe)
safely drawn, such as the method of death being an 'impact' with an energy
of 'unknown type'. From there, however, things get a bit dodgy.
Did spasms
from the sun either directly or by triggering a reaction in the planet,
cause these die offs? Are these animal deaths the result of 'warfare', here
on earth or beyond, involving energy weapons? Either or both are plausible.
Does it matter? Well, maybe not.
From the viewpoint of populace soon to be
herded by events, the 'truth' will somehow 'matter' in spite of the [daily
terrors] that will be [surfacing] to [control their thoughts (and lives)].
This year, according to how some humans interpret the Mayan, and Aztec
calendars, is to be a year of acceleration of events as cycles within cycles
race to completion. Of course we note that so far in this manifestation of
universe, cycles just start over.
In the case of
2012 though, there is doubt. Not only by the actual language
used by the creators of
the Dresden and Madrid codices, but also within the
now huge volume of material spewing out about the subject. There is so much
coming out that the newly awakening mind, faced with the torrents of
material, is probably better off eating pie and reading the book of self
as the taoist pie bakers said waaaay back when
.
Self knowledge is the beginning of wisdom. Serious martial artists refer to
the process of self knowledge as the struggle. True victory, for those on
the path, does not come from vanquishing any number of enemies, but rather
from a single, lifelong battle with self.
To stand alone is to be uncorrupted, innocent, free of all tradition, of
dogma, of opinion, of what another says, and so on. Such a mind does not
seek because there is nothing to seek; being free, such a mind is completely
still without a want, without movement. But this state is not to be
achieved; it isnt a thing that you buy through discipline; it doesnt come
into being by giving up sex, or practicing a certain yoga.
It comes into
being only when there is an understanding of the ways of the self, the me,
which shows itself through the conscious mind in every day activity, and
also in the unconscious.
What matters is to understand for oneself, not
through the direction of others, the total content of consciousness, which
is conditioned, which is the result of society, of religion, of various
impacts, impressions, memories - to understand all that conditioning and be
free of it. But there is no how to be free.
If you ask how to be free, you
are not listening.
So says
J. Krishnamurti
a smart human.
Some time back, perhaps three years or so, while working on tuning the
lexicon, and as part of personal, linguistic background processing, and in
order to maintain currency (not the paper debt kind) with the subtle changes
in meaning of words, experiment c (the me here now), was playing a video
of a
Project Camelot (on line woo-woo guys) conference which had taken place
in South America, probably Ecuador, if memory serves.
Anyway, the conference
had gotten to a question and answer session, and a young woman stood to ask
a question (which
Bob Dean answered?) .
The question went to the
David Wilcock (a
woo-woo guy, also on line) idea of a
2012 Ascension with a big
A.
The idea that David proposes is that, (hopefully stated correctly
herein otherwise sure to be shit headed my way), some humans, by virtue of
some virtue, will, in 2012, ascend to another level of density, wherein
they will not be here on this terra, but on a terra in another state of
being, and wherein they will all have all the
siddhis (be able to create
pies out of thin air by merely thinking about them, and other trivial tricks
such as fly, bi-locate, telepathy, et al kinds of good things).
So, sitting
there, working lexical issues, coffee in hand and about to drink, when the
young woman asks the PeeCamel panel about the whole ascension issue for
2012. Both the details of the question, and the answer are entirely
irrelevant here, as the point is that the phrase she used was so perfectly
hilarious given the setting and participants and concept.
She somehow
prefaced her question with the statement that I have been doing the
work
or words to that effect
at that point, coffee began spewing out of
my nose and all over the keyboard, the rest of the conversation was lost.
What was so striking, so totally disruptive of the swallowing process that
the coffee decided it had to jump right out the snout, was the phrase doing
the work that she used. The way she used it, saying it with a bit of pride,
but also as though totally disgusted in the doing of it
annoyed, somehow,
that Ascension required effort.
It was the context expressed in the language
that begged the question as to just what the work was? Did she do extra
poses in yoga? Or more pilates? Or was she kind to homeless? Or did she tip
extra well on the way to the first class section of the plane?
Her reference to
David Wilcocks big A, ascension theory was clearly
stated as though it was a proven fact, and that she expected it to be
accepted in the setting in which she spoke as proven fact. Her language
betrayed the layers of conditioning that the big A ascension theory had
put upon her mind.
David may not have any clue that his words are used by
anothers mind to form layers of conditioning in her experience of our
common collectively manifesting reality. There is evidence that he is so
aware that comes leaking out in his choice of words in front of crowds, but
there is also no sign of any maliciousness involved.
There is no evidence
for instance that David is a control freak trying to work the religion
angle, in the dependency sense.
Unlike some personalities in the wujo, and
in the greater woo-woo world out there, who are aware that conditioning
comes from their words. Some of these beings seek to exploit the
conditioning layers that they heap out continuously. Some try to be real
pindars about being in control and telling others how to be in universe.
And
thus is revealed why
new age isn't no better than
old tyme religion
just yet
more damn conditioning between the mind and its attempt to know self. Or as
my pappy from Missouri used to say,
religion is just a man in a dress
trying to tell you that he gets a piece of your pie just because he has
voices in his head telling him that he is in charge of the slicing.
The memory of that entire video comes down to that phrase doing the work.
So much of our presence, our life directions and our karmic process leaks
out in our language. It is my experience, maturing into the wujo, that words
have power, and must be used deliberately and with care, as undoubtedly
universe will use these words to form layers of conditioning in some other
humans life. Karmic bonds come from such interweaving of life energies.
Even in noting Krishnamurtis discussion on desire, and the effects of the
klesa duality on life, it is still the desire here at hph to put out our
descriptions of leaking language lexical puzzles and to not have these
reports become part of someones conditioning, or dogma.
The idea here is to
provide a forecast of manifesting reality that can be used by the
aware
individual in their examination of self. The idea is to reject any words
herein that would be used to condition mind. In any damn direction. By any
foolish person.
And as with the young woman asking the question at the PeeCamel conference,
J. Krishnamurti said it pretty plainly
If you ask how to be free, you are not listening.
