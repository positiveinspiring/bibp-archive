# Julian Assange - 'Google is Not What it Seems' - They 'Do Things the CIA 
Cannot'

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_wikileaks74.htm

Now, as the Wikileaks founder faces
days of questioning by a Swedish special prosecutor over
rape allegations inside his Ecuadorian Embassy haven in London
today - and particularly in wake of the presidential election -
Assange's warning Google "is not what it seems" must be
revisited.
Under intense scrutiny by the U.S.
State Department for several controversial Wikileaks'
publications of leaked documents in 2011, Assange first met
Google Executive Chairman, then-CEO,
Eric Schmidt, who
approached the political refugee under the premise of a new
book.
Schmidt, whose worth
Forbes estimates
exceeds $11 billion, partnered with
Council on Foreign Relations
and State Department veteran,
Jared Cohen, for the work,
tentatively titled The Empire of the Mind - and asked Assange
for an interview.
Later acknowledging naïveté in
agreeing to meet the pair of tech heavyweights, Assange found
afterward how enmeshed in and integral to U.S. global agendas
Schmidt and Cohen had become.
In fact, both have exhibited quite
the fascination with technology's role in burgeoning revolutions
- including, but not-at-all limited to, the Arab Spring.
Schmidt
created a position for Cohen in 2009, originally called Google
Ideas, now Google
Jigsaw, and the two began weaving the company's importance
to the United States into narratives in articles, political
donations, and through Cohen's former roles at the State
Department.
That same year, Schmidt and Cohen
co-authored an article for the CFR journal
Foreign Affairs,
which, seven years hence, appears a rather prescient discussion
of Google's self-importance in governmental affairs.
Under the subheading "COALITIONS OF
THE CONNECTED," they
wrote:
"In an era when the power of the
individual and the group grows daily, those governments that
ride the technological wave will clearly be best positioned
to assert their influence and bring others into their
orbits. And those that do not will find themselves at odds
with their citizens.
"Democratic states that have
built coalitions of their militaries have the capacity to do
the same with their connection technologies.
[
] they offer
a new way to exercise the duty to protect citizens around
the world who are abused by their governments or barred from
voicing their opinions."
Perhaps appearing laudable on its
surface - at least to some degree - as Assange pointed out,
there is a self-mischaracterization by the American and other
Western governments and inaccurately-monikered 'non-governmental
organizations' that their interests in other nations' affairs
are innately good.
This cult of government and
non-government insiders have a firm belief their goals should be
the unassailable, unquestionable motivator for American
imperialism - whatever the U.S. thinks best as a "benevolent
superpower," so should the rest of the 'non-evil' world.
"They will tell you that
open-mindedness is a virtue, but all perspectives that
challenge the exceptionalist drive at the heart of American
foreign policy will remain invisible to them," Assange
wrote in When Google Met Wikileaks.
"This is the impenetrable
banality of 'don't be evil.' They believe that they are
doing good.
And that is a problem."
Cohen, an Adjunct Senior Fellow at
the notorious Council on Foreign
Relations,
lists his expertise in,
"terrorism; radicalization; impact of
connection technologies on 21st century statecraft; Iran,"
...and
has worked for both Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton at the
Department of State.
Fortune, calling Cohen a "fascinating
fellow,"
noted that, in his book
Children of Jihad, the young diplomat and technology
enthusiast,
"advocates for the use of technology for social
upheaval in the Middle East and elsewhere."
Under the auspices of discussing
technological aspects at Wikileaks' disposal for the upcoming
book,
-
Schmidt
-
Cohen
-
Lisa Shields, a CFR vice president at the
time
-
Scott Malcomson, who would shortly afterward be
appointed Rice's lead speech advisor for her role as the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations,
...descended on Assange's safe
haven in Norfolk, outside London.
It wasn't until weeks and months
after this gathering Assange fully realized
how closely Google
operates in tandem with the government of the United States -
and how perilous the innocent mask of its public intentions
truly is in light of such cooperation.
Ironically enough, in Wikileaks'
publishing three years later of the
Global Intelligence Files -
internal emails from private security firm,
Stratfor - Cohen's
and Google's true depth of influence became strikingly apparent.
Assange wrote:
"Cohen's directorate appeared to
cross over from public relations and 'corporate
responsibility' work into active corporate intervention in
foreign affairs at a level that is normally reserved for
states.
Jared Cohen could be wryly named Google's 'director
of regime change.' According to the emails, he was trying to
plant his fingerprints on some of the major historical
events in the contemporary Middle East.
He could be placed
in Egypt during the revolution, meeting with Wael Ghonim,
the Google employee whose arrest and imprisonment hours
later would make him a PR-friendly symbol of the uprising in
the Western press.
Meetings had been planned in Palestine
and Turkey, both of which - claimed Stratfor emails - were
killed by the senior Google leadership as too risky.
Only a
few months before he met with me, Cohen was planning a trip
to the edge of Iran in Azerbaijan to 'engage the Iranian
communities closer to the border,' as part of Google Ideas'
project on repressive societies."
However, most significantly,
Stratfor vice president for intelligence Fred Burton, also a
former official with the State Department, wrote in one of those
emails:
"Google is getting WH [White
House] and State Dept support and air cover. In reality they
are doing things the CIA cannot do...
[Cohen] is going to
get himself kidnapped or killed. Might be the best thing to
happen to expose Google's covert role in foaming up-risings,
to be blunt.
The US Gov't can then disavow knowledge and
Google is left holding the shit-bag."
Of course, the massive company - its
various facets now under the umbrella of
Alphabet, Inc.
- has
never been fully absent government involvement.
Research for
what would become ultimately become Google had been undertaken
by company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in cooperation
with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) - the
strictly secretive technological testing and planning arm for
the Department of Defense.
Indeed Google's continued coziness
with the diplomacy, military, and intelligence wings of the
United States government should not be, though perpetually are,
ignored.
Political establishment bulldogs on
both sides of the aisle and their cheerleader
corporate media presstitutes will continue for months or years to debate the
failed presidential bid of
Hillary Clinton and the
apparently-shocking rise and election of Donald Trump, but
technology played a starring role in those events.
Several
reports last year cautioned Google's algorithms could swing the
election - and not only the American election, but national
elections around the globe.
"We estimate, based on win
margins in national elections around the world," said Robert
Epstein, a psychologist with the American Institute for
Behavioral Research and Technology and author of
one of the studies, "that Google could determine the
outcome of upwards of 25 percent of all national elections."
Considering lines between the tech
giant and the government have essentially been abandoned, this
revelation puts power and influence into acute, if not
terrifying, perspective.
Google's ties with the Pentagon and
intelligence communities never ceased.
Revealed by a Freedom of
Information Act request cited by Assange, Google founder Brin,
together with Schmidt,
corresponded casually by email with National Security Agency
chief Gen. Keith Alexander in 2012, discussing a program called
the "Enduring
Society Framework."
Alexander wrote to Brin:
"Your insights as a key member
of the Defense Industrial Base are valuable to ensure ESF's
efforts have measurable impact."
According to the Department of
Homeland Security, the
Defense Industrial Base
is,
"the worldwide industrial
complex that enables research and development, as well as
design, production, delivery, and maintenance of military
weapons systems, subsystems, and components or parts, to
meet U.S. military requirements ."
It also provides,
"products and services that are
essential to mobilize, deploy, and sustain military
operations."
Although Schmidt and Cohen
ultimately watered down their book title The Empire of the Mind
into the more palatable and less blatantly imperialistic,
The
New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future of People, Nations, and
Business, its message amounted to self-congratulatory
justification for broader foreign policy goals.
Nefarious warmonger
Henry Kissinger,
for one, praised the work, which included telling lines by the
Google execs, such as:
"What Lockheed Martin was to the
twentieth century, technology and cyber-security companies
will be to the twenty-first."
So ubiquitous has Google become, its
presence - like similarly
U.S. government-connected Facebook -
is nearly indispensable in the daily lives of hundreds of
millions worldwide.
However well-known is the government
intelligence framework in such platforms, it would be
ill-advised to ignore the far darker Machiavellian aspects of
private corporate technology's intersection with global
political agendas - and the force that coalition wields around
the planet.
Whether or not the American
establishment's empire suffered a blow in the election of Donald
Trump will be a debatable point for some time, but it's a
veritable guarantee its cogs - seeing themselves as the planet's
saviors - have planned in advance for just such an occasion.
"If the future of the internet
is to be Google," Assange
noted, "that should be of serious concern to people all
over the world, in,
-
Latin America
-
East and Southeast Asia
-
the Indian subcontinent
-
the Middle East
-
sub-Saharan
Africa
-
the former Soviet Union
-
even in Europe,
...for whom
the internet embodies the promise of an alternative to US
cultural, economic, and strategic hegemony."
Empire will remain empire
until its
dying breath - particularly if it functions under the obstinate
belief it, alone, can save the world.
Julian Assange should be praised for
the transparency and insight he and Wikileaks have readily given
the world, instead of excoriated and blamed for faults which lie
in the establishment framework - it is this political,
intelligence, and military web deserving of a pointed finger...
