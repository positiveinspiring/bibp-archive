When governments and businesses cannot handle
the truth, WikiLeaks helps you blow the whistle and takes the heat.
SPEAKER: Julian Assange (AU) Spokesperson & Advisory Board Member,
WikiLeaks
An open platform for the anonymous publishing of compromising documents;
according to Time Magazine, WikiLeaks could become as important a
journalistic tool as the Freedom of Information Act.
Honorable analogy for sure, but one earned at
the expense of powerful players like Sarah Palin, Kaupthing Bank and lately,
with the controversial book Jaeger, the Danish Ministry of Defense.
Praised for its democratic devotion and
threatened by the shadier powers that be, each day is a victory for
WikiLeaks.
