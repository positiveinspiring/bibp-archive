Washington is heading to open
confrontation with Iran at the behest of Israel, indicates
Wayne Madsen, who also explores how the Israeli lobby
through its tentacular penetration of key power centers is
attempting to stop any opposition to the strike.
The silver lining is that
threatened countries, like Iran and Pakistan, have been
invited to come under the protective security umbrella of
Russia and China within the SCO, increasingly regarded as a
credible counterweight to NATO.
Israels all-powerful lobby in Washington, the
American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC),
an organization composed of,
...is steamrolling through the House of
Representatives H.R. 1905 [1], which would prohibit the President
of the United States, the Secretary of State, members of the U.S. Foreign
Service, or any special envoy from engaging in any sort of diplomatic
contact, official or unofficial, with any member or agent of the government
of Iran.
Only when the President informs the requisite
committees may he proceed with engaging on diplomatic contact with Iran.
Israel has de facto control over the foreign
affairs committees of Congress, so any White House notification of the need
to contact Iranian officials would be instantly transmitted to Binyamin
Netanyahus office in Jerusalem and Israel would then circumvent any
U.S.-Iranian contact. AIPAC, with its resolution, is further making the
United States a vassal of the Jewish state.
Israels strategy is to make certain that its plans to attack Irans nuclear
facilities and, perhaps other targets, meet no opposition from diplomatic
circles in the United States
Israel has placed its own interests well
beyond and in contravention of those of the United States.
Faced with the prospect of an Israeli attack on Iran, backed by Saudi Arabia
- Israels secret ally in the region - has had ripple effects across the
Middle East and Asia.
Countries in Asia are scrambling to join the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO) as full members.
Confronted by a belligerent United States, NATO,
and Israel intent on toppling the governments of Syria and Iran, the
economic, cultural, and de facto collective security pact that comprises,
-
Russia
-
China
-
Kazakhstan
-
Kyrgyzstan
-
Uzbekistan
-
Tajikistan,
...announced after its prime ministers summit
in St. Petersburg that SCO would soon be opening its doors for full
membership for Pakistan, Iran, and India.
The Asian nations want to freeze the United
States out of interference in Asia.
Ahead of the St. Petersburg summit, Russia and China strongly warned the
West against any military attack on Iran. The words being used in
international diplomacy are reminiscent of the Cold War era, however, it is
the West that is playing to role of the aggressor, albeit an aggressor led
around by Israel and its intelligence spies and assets embedded in the upper
echelons of governments in Washington, London, Paris, Berlin, and within the
United Nations hierarchy.
Even Americas vassal state of Afghanistan, eager to break free of the bonds
of NATO and Washington, has attained observer status in SCO. Recent comments
by the deputy commander of NATO training in Afghanistan, U.S. Army Major
General Peter Fuller, that the Afghan government leadership is erratic,
ungrateful, and isolated from reality because President Hamid Karzai said
Afghanistan would side with Pakistan in an American war on Pakistan,
resulted in Fullers firing.
Fullers comments also resulted in Karzai asking
for observer status in SCO as American aggression against the Muslim world
and opposition to sovereignty for Palestine has seen Washingtons standing
around the world plummet.
Another nation where the CIA, Pentagon, and billionaire provocateur George
Soros has their agents creeping and crawling, Mongolia, is also a SCO
observer. There are also SCO "partners in dialogue" - nations that could
attain SCO observer or membership status in the future. Partners in dialogue
nations include Belarus, Sri Lanka, and one that should worry Tel Aviv and
Washington, Turkey, a NATO member.
Moscow and Ankara agree that Turkey should
eventually become a full SCO member. Turkey has close historical and
cultural links with the Turkic nations of central Asia and with many of the
autonomous Turkic republics of Russia, including Tuva, Bashkortostan, and
Adygeya.
Turkey has grown tired of Israeli interference in its internal and external
affairs, as witnessed by the vicious and bloody Israeli attack on the
Turkish Gaza aid vessel, the Mavi Marmara; Mossad support for Kurdish PKK
terrorist attacks in Turkey; and covert Israeli entanglement in the
Ergenekon "deep state" network in Turkey.
Iran has now seen Israels most-open secret ally, Saudi Arabia, appoint the
former Egyptian intelligence chief and close Netanyahu friend, Omar
Suleiman, as an adviser to Saudi heir apparent, Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdul
Aziz al-Saud, who is also the Interior Minister.
The Jerusalem-Riyadh axis is being further
cemented as the Obama administration is shifting 4,000 troops from Iraq to
Kuwait and beefing up other U.S. military assets in Bahrain - home of the
U.S. Fifth Fleet - and Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Oman. The CIA and
Pentagon have set up Predator drone bases in Djibouti, Seychelles, Ethiopia,
and, reportedly, Saudi Arabia.
The president-elect of Kyrgyzstan, Prime Minister Almazbek Atambaev, has
announced he wants the U.S. and NATO to leave the Manas Transit Center
airbase in his country after the current lease expires in 2014.
Already, Soros-funded non-governmental
organization (NGO) agents in Kyrgyzstan are attempting to suggest that under
the new Kyrgyz constitution, Atambaev does not have the authority to close
the base. It is this type of U.S. interference in the affairs of the nations
of Asia that has SCO readying an expansion of its membership to include two
nations that have received direct U.S. military threats: Iran and Pakistan.
Suspicion of U.S. intentions and military plans
has also made Washingtons request to enter SCO as a partner in dialogue a
dead issue. Washingtons interest in attending SCO summits as a partner
says more about the CIAs inability to crack into the inner workings of SCO,
even through erstwhile allies like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Mongolia,
than in having any great desire to dialogue with SCO members and
observers.
After all, AIPAC and its minions have managed to
jam through the U.S. House a law that prohibits any U.S. diplomatic contact
with Tehrans officials.
President Obama is under tremendous pressure from the Israel Lobby during an
election year to support an Israeli military strike on Iran, action that
will inevitably lead the United States military in the Gulf region into war
against Iran on behalf of the Tel Aviv/west Jerusalem regime.
At the G-20 summit in Cannes, French President
Nicolas Sarkozy was overheard
telling Obama,
"I cannot bear Netanyahu, hes a liar."
To which Obama replied,
"youre fed up, but I have to deal with him
every day."
The Sarkozy-Obama interchange is instructive.
Obama did not disagree that Netanyahu is a
patent liar who will do anything or say anything to advance Israeli and
global Zionist interests over all else, even to the point of lying about a
bogus Iranian nuclear weapons threat to promote a military attack on Iran.
Israel, using its agents of influence in the UN delegations of the United
States, Britain, Germany, Canada, Sweden, and the Netherlands, has ensured
that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano
has tainted his agencys report on Iranian nuclear developments in a manner
that would have never been tolerated by his predecessor, Mohammed ElBaradei.
Amano certainly took no interest in the fact
that his own nation, Japan, was secretly producing nuclear weapons at the
Fukushima nuclear complex in contravention of IAEA rules. The aftermath of
the destructive earthquake in Japan laid open the secret work going on at
Fukushima.
Amano is perfectly willing to act as a cipher
for Israel and the Israel Lobby in "discovering" IAEA violations by Iran.
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists "Doomsday Clock," a measure of how close
the world is to nuclear war, now stands at six minutes until midnight.
With the machinations of Israel toward Iran, the
internal meltdown of Obamas White House staff with the demotion of chief of
staff Bill Daley, and the invitation by SCO to Iran to come under the
protective security umbrella of Russia and China, the clock has just jumped
ahead several minutes.
