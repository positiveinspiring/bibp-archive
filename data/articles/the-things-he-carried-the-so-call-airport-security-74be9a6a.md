If I were a terrorist, and Im not, but if I
were a terrorista frosty, tough-like-Chuck-Norris terrorist, say a C-title
jihadist with Hezbollah or, more likely, a donkey-work operative with the
Judean Peoples FrontI would not do what I did in the bathroom of the
MinneapolisSt. Paul International Airport, which was to place myself in
front of a sink in open view of the male American flying public and
ostentatiously rip up a sheaf of counterfeit boarding passes that had been
created for me by a frenetic and acerbic security expert named Bruce
Schneier.
He had made these boarding passes in his
sophisticated underground forgery works, which consists of a Sony Vaio
laptop and an HP LaserJet printer, in order to prove that the Transportation
Security Administration, which is meant to protect American aviation from
al-Qaeda, represents an egregious waste of tax dollars,
dollars that could otherwise be used to catch terrorists before they arrive
at the MinneapolisSt. Paul International Airport, by which time it is,
generally speaking, too late.
I could have ripped up these counterfeit boarding passes in the privacy of a
toilet stall, but I chose not to, partly because this was the renowned
Senator Larry Craig Memorial Wide-Stance Bathroom, and since the
commencement of the Global War on Terror this particular bathroom has
been patrolled by security officials trying to protect it from gay sex, and
partly because I wanted to see whether my fellow passengers would report me
to the TSA for acting suspiciously in a public bathroom.
No one did, thus thwarting, yet again, my plans
to get arrested, or at least be the recipient of a thorough sweating by the
FBI, for dubious behavior in a large American airport. Suspicious
that the measures put in place after the attacks
of
September 11 to prevent further such attacks are almost entirely
for showsecurity theater is the term of artI have for some time now been
testing, in modest ways, their effectiveness.
Because the TSAs security regimen seems to be
mainly thing-basedmost of its 44,500 airport officers are assigned to
truffle through carry-on bags for things like guns, bombs, three-ounce tubes
of anthrax, Crest toothpaste, nail clippers, Snapple, and so onI focused my
efforts on bringing bad things through security in many different airports,
primarily my home airport, Washingtons Reagan National, the one situated
approximately 17 feet from the Pentagon, but also in Los Angeles, New York,
Miami, Chicago, and at the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport
(which is where I came closest to arousing at least a modest level of
suspicion, receiving a symbolic pat-downall frisks that avoid the sensitive
regions are by definition symbolicand one question about the presence of a
Leatherman Multi-Tool in my pocket; said Leatherman was confiscated
and is now, I hope, living with the loving family of a TSA employee).
And because I have a fair amount of experience
reporting on terrorists, and because terrorist groups produce large
quantities of branded knickknacks, Ive amassed an inspiring collection of
al-Qaeda T-shirts, Islamic Jihad flags, Hezbollah videotapes, and inflatable
Yasir Arafat dolls (really).
All these things Ive carried with me through
airports across the country.
Ive also carried, at various times:
pocketknives, matches from hotels in Beirut and Peshawar, dust masks,
lengths of rope, cigarette lighters, nail clippers, eight-ounce tubes of
toothpaste (in my front pocket), bottles of Fiji Water (which is foreign),
and, of course, box cutters. I was selected for secondary screening four
timesout of dozens of passages through security checkpointsduring this
extended experiment.
At one screening, I was relieved of a pair of
nail clippers; during another, a can of shaving cream.
During one secondary inspection, at OHare International Airport in Chicago,
I was wearing under my shirt a spectacular, only-in-America device called a
Beerbelly, a neoprene sling that holds a polyurethane bladder and drinking
tube. The Beerbelly, designed originally to sneak alcoholup to 80
ouncesinto football games, can quite obviously be used to sneak up to 80
ounces of liquid through airport security.
(The company that manufactures the Beerbelly
also makes something called a Winerack, a bra that holds up to 25 ounces
of booze and is recommended, according to the companys Web site, for PTA
meetings.)
My Beerbelly, which fit comfortably over
my beer belly, contained two cans worth of Bud Light at the time of the
inspection. It went undetected. The eight-ounce bottle of water in my
carry-on bag, however, was seized by the federal government.
On another occasion, at LaGuardia, in New York, the transportation-security
officer in charge of my secondary screening emptied my carry-on bag of
nearly everything it contained, including a yellow, three-foot-by-four-foot
Hezbollah flag, purchased at a Hezbollah gift shop in south Lebanon.
The flag features, as its charming main image,
an upraised fist clutching an AK-47 automatic rifle. Atop the rifle is a
line of Arabic writing that reads Then surely the party of God are they
who will be triumphant. The officer took the flag and spread it out on
the inspection table. She finished her inspection, gave me back my flag, and
told me I could go.
I said,
Thats a Hezbollah flag. She said,
Uh-huh. Not Uh-huh, Ive been trained to recognize the symbols of
anti-American terror groups, but after careful inspection of your
physical person, your behavior, and your last name, Ive come to the
conclusion that you are not a Bekaa Valleytrained threat to the United
States commercial aviation system, but Uh-huh, Im going on break, why
are you talking to me?
The author's forged boarding
passcomplete with
Platinum/Elite Plus status
and magical TSA-approval squigglegot him through security.
In Minneapolis, I littered my carry-on with many
of my prohibited items, and also an Osama bin Laden, Hero of Islam
T-shirt, which often gets a rise out of people who see it.
This day, however, would feature a different
sort of experiment, designed to prove not only that the TSA often cannot
find anything on you or in your carry-on, but that it has no actual idea who
you are, despite the governments effort to build a comprehensive no-fly
list. A no-fly list would be a good idea if it worked; Bruce Schneiers
homemade boarding passes were about to prove that it doesnt.
Schneier is the TSAs most relentless, and
effective, critic; the TSA director, Kip Hawley, told me he respects
Schneiers opinions, though Schneier quite clearly makes his life
miserable.
The whole system is designed to catch
stupid terrorists, Schneier told me.
A smart terrorist, he says, wont try to bring a
knife aboard a plane, as I had been doing; hell make his own, in the
airplane bathroom.
Schneier told me the recipe:
Get some steel epoxy glue at a hardware
store. It comes in two tubes, one with steel dust and then a hardener.
You make the mold by folding a piece of cardboard in two, and then you
mix the two tubes together. You can use a metal spoon for the handle. It
hardens in 15 minutes.
As we stood at an airport Starbucks, Schneier
spread before me a batch of fabricated boarding passes for Northwest
Airlines flight 1714, scheduled to depart at 2:20 p.m. and arrive at Reagan
National at 5:47 p.m. He had taken the liberty of upgrading us to first
class, and had even granted me Platinum/Elite Plus status, which was
gracious of him.
This status would allow us to skip the ranks of
hoi-polloi flyers and join the expedited line, which is my
preference, because those knotty, teeming security lines are the most
dangerous places in airports: terrorists could paralyze U.S. aviation merely
by detonating a bomb at any security checkpoint, all of which are, of
course, entirely unsecured.
(I once asked Michael Chertoff, the
secretary of Homeland Security, about this. We actually ultimately do have
a vision of trying to move the security checkpoint away from the gate,
deeper into the airport itself, but theres always going to be some place
that people congregate. So if youre asking me, is there any way to protect
against a person taking a bomb into a crowded location and blowing it up,
the answer is no.)
Schneier and I walked to the security checkpoint.
Counterterrorism in the airport is a show
designed to make people feel better, he said. Only two things have
made flying safer: the reinforcement of cockpit doors, and the fact that
passengers know now to resist hijackers.
This assumes, of course, that al-Qaeda will
target airplanes for hijacking, or target aviation at all.
We defend against what the terrorists did
last week, Schneier said.
He believes that the country would be just as
safe as it is today if airport security were rolled back to pre-9/11 levels.
Spend the rest of your money on
intelligence, investigations, and emergency response.
Schneier and I joined the line with our ersatz
boarding passes.
Technically we could get arrested for
this, he said, but we judged the risk to be acceptable.
We handed our boarding passes and IDs to the
security officer, who inspected our drivers licenses through a loupe, one
of those magnifying-glass devices jewelers use for minute examinations of
fine detail.
This was the moment of maximum peril, not
because the boarding passes were flawed, but because the TSA now trains its
officers in the science of behavior detection.
The SPOT programScreening of
Passengers by Observation Techniqueswas based in part on the work of a
psychologist who believes that involuntary facial-muscle movements,
including the most fleeting micro-expressions, can betray lying or
criminality. The training program for behavior-detection officers is one
week long. Our facial muscles did not cooperate with the SPOT program,
apparently, because the officer chicken-scratched onto our boarding passes
what might have been his signature, or the number 4, or the letter
y.
We took our shoes off and placed our laptops in
bins. Schneier took from his bag a 12-ounce container labeled saline
solution.
Its allowed, he said. Medical supplies,
such as saline solution for contact-lens cleaning, dont fall under the
TSAs three-ounce rule.
Whats allowed? I asked. Saline solution, or bottles labeled saline
solution?
Bottles labeled saline solution. They wont check whats in it, trust
me.
They did not check. As we gathered our
belongings, Schneier held up the bottle and said to the nearest security
officer,
This is okay, right?
Yep, the officer said. Just have to put
it in the tray.
Maybe if you lit it on fire, hed pay attention, I said, risking
arrest for making a joke at airport security. (Later, Schneier would
carry two bottles labeled saline solution24 ounces in totalthrough
security. An officer asked him why he needed two bottles. Two eyes, he
said. He was allowed to keep the bottles.)
We were in the clear. But what did we prove?
We proved that the ID triangle is
hopeless, Schneier said.
The ID triangle: before a passenger boards a
commercial flight, he interacts with his airline or the government three
timeswhen he purchases his ticket; when he passes through airport security;
and finally at the gate, when he presents his boarding pass to an airline
agent. It is at the first point of contact, when the ticket is purchased,
that a passengers name is checked against the governments no-fly list.
It is not checked again, and for this reason,
Schneier argued, the process is merely another form of security theater.
The goal is to make sure that this ID
triangle represents one person, he explained. Heres how you get
around it. Lets assume youre a terrorist and you believe your name is
on the watch list.
Its easy for a terrorist to check whether the
government has cottoned on to his existence, Schneier said; he simply has
to submit his name online to the new, privately run CLEAR program, which is
meant to fast-pass approved travelers through security. If the terrorist is
rejected, then he knows hes on the watch list.
To slip through the only check against the no-fly list, the terrorist uses a
stolen credit card to buy a ticket under a fake name.
Then you print a fake boarding pass with
your real name on it and go to the airport. You give your real ID, and
the fake boarding pass with your real name on it, to security. Theyre
checking the documents against each other.
Theyre not checking your name against the
no-fly listthat was done on the airlines computers. Once youre
through security, you rip up the fake boarding pass, and use the real
boarding pass that has the name from the stolen credit card. Then you
board the plane, because theyre not checking your name against your ID
at boarding.
What if you dont know how to steal a credit
card?
Then youre a stupid terrorist and the
government will catch you, he said.
What if you dont know how to download a PDF of
an actual boarding pass and alter it on a home computer?
Then youre a stupid terrorist and the
government will catch you.
I couldnt believe that what Schneier was saying
was truein the national debate over the no-fly list, it is seldom, if ever,
mentioned that the no-fly list doesnt work.
Its true, he said. The gap blows the
whole system out of the water.
This called for a visit to TSA headquarters. The
headquarters is located in Pentagon City, just outside Washington. Kip
Hawley, the man who runs the agency, is a bluff, amiable fellow who is
capable of making a TSA joke.
Do you want three ounces of water?
he asked me.
I raised the subject of the ID triangle, hoping
to get a cogent explanation.
This is what Hawley said:
The TDCthats ticket document
checkerwill make a notation on your ticket and thats something that
will follow you all the way through to the gate.
But all they do is write a little squiggly mark on the boarding pass,
I said.
You think you might be able to forge that? he asked me.
My handwriting is terrible, but dont you think someone can forge it?
I asked.
Well, uh, maybe. Maybe not, he said.
Aha! I thought. Hes hiding something from me.
Are you telling me that I dont know about
something thats going on? I asked.
Were well aware of the scenario you describe. Bruce has been talking
about it for two years, he said, referring to Schneiers efforts to
publicize the gaps in the ID triangle.
Isnt it a basic flaw, that youre checking the no-fly list at the
point of purchase, not at the airport?
He leaned back in his chair.
What do you do about vulnerabilities? he
asked, rhetorically. All the time you hear reports and people saying,
Theres a vulnerability. Well, duh. There are vulnerabilities
everywhere, in everything. The question is not Is there a
vulnerability? Its What are you doing about it?
Well, what are you doing about it?
There are vulnerabilities where you have
limited ways to address it directly. So you have to put other layers
around it, other things that will catch them when that vulnerability is
breached. This is a universal problem. Somebody will identify a very
small thing and drill down and say, I found a vulnerability.
In other words, the TSA has no immediate plans
to check passengers against the no-fly list at the moment before they board
their flight. (Hawley said that boarding passes will eventually be encrypted
so the TSA can follow their progress from printer to gate.) Nor does it plan
to screen airport employees when they show up for work each day.
Pilotsor people dressed as pilotsare screened,
as the public knows, but thats because they enter the airport through the
front door. The employees who drive fuel trucks, and make french fries
at McDonalds, and clean airplane bathrooms (to the extent that theyre
cleaned anymore) do not pass through magnetometers when they enter the
airport, and their possessions are not searched.
To me this always seemed to be, well, another
vulnerability.
Do you know what you have on the inside of
an airport? Hawley asked me. You have all the military traveling, you
have guns, chemicals, jet fuel.
So the idea that we would spend a whole lot
of resources putting a perimeter around that, running every worker,
50,000 people, every day, through securitywhy in the heck would you do
that? Because all they have to do is walk through clean and then have
someone throw something over a fence.
I asked about the depth of background screening
for airport employees. He said, noncommittally,
It goes reasonably deep.
So there are, in other words, two classes of
people in airports: those whose shoes are inspected for explosives, and
those whose arent. How, I asked, do you explain that to the public in a way
that makes sense?
Social networks, he answered. Its a very
tuned-in workforce. Youre never alone when youre on or around a plane.
What is that guy spending all that time in the cockpit for? All
airport employees know what normal is.
Hawley did say that TSA employees conduct random
ID checks and magnetometer screenings, but he did not say how frequently.
I suppose Ive seen too many movies, but, really? Social networks? Behavior
detection? The TSA budget is almost $7 billion. That money would be better
spent on the penetration of al-Qaeda social networks.
As I stood in the bathroom, ripping up boarding passes, waiting for the
social network of male bathroom users to report my suspicious behavior, I
decided to make myself as nervous as possible. I would try to pass through
security with no ID, a fake boarding pass, and an Osama bin Laden T-shirt
under my coat. I splashed water on my face to mimic sweat, put on a coat (it
was a summer day), hid my drivers license, and approached security with a
bogus boarding pass that Schneier had made for me.
I told the document checker at security that I
had lost my identification but was hoping I would still be able to make my
flight. He said Id have to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor arrived;
he looked smart, unfortunately.
I was starting to get genuinely nervous, which I
hoped would generate incriminating micro-expressions.
I cant find my drivers license, I said.
I showed him my fake boarding pass. I need to get to Washington
quickly, I added.
He asked me if I had any other identification.
I showed him a credit card with my name on it, a
library card, and a health-insurance card.
Nothing else? he asked.
No, I said.
You should really travel with a second picture ID, you know.
Yes, sir, I said.
All right, you can go, he said, pointing me to the X-ray line. But
let this be a lesson for you.
