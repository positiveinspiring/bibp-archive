# Brent Scowcroft

This was brought to my attention yesterday by two articles from journalist David Corn writing in “The Nation”.
Excerpt:
“The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board--usually referred to by its acronym--is a group of prominent citizens who offer advice to the President on sensitive intelligence matters. It was established in 1956 by President Eisenhower, and past chairmen have included former Senator Warren Rudman, former House Speaker Thomas Foley, and former Defense Secretary Les Aspin. In recent years, PFIAB has conducted investigations (often through its Intelligence Oversight Board) of spy- community controversies. It examined lax security at Department of Energy nuclear weapons facilities, CIA involvement with Guatemalan military officials who committed human rights abuses, US intelligence failures in Somalia, and the CIA's cover-its-ass investigation of CIA director John Deutch, who compromised classified information. PFIAB challenged the charge--popular in rightwing circles--that China had stolen nuclear weapons secrets from the United States. ("Possible damage has been minted as probable disaster; workaday delay and bureaucratic confusion has been cast as diabolical conspiracies," a PFIAB report concluded. "Enough is enough.")”

Bush `Pioneer’
Trust Company of the West is a massive private money management company that manages mutual funds for Dean Witter. Henry Kissinger sits on its board. Day is the grandson of the founder of Superior Oil Co. Trust played major back-room roles in early to mid-`90s takeover battles for Santa Fe Pacific Corp, Blockbuster Entertainment and Chrysler Corp. Trust took major hits in the mid-`90s from: the Mexican peso devaluation; troubled real estate holdings; and an exodus of top managers. Thereafter, Trust aggressively pursued would-be buyers. Negotiations kept breaking down, in part because potential buyers said Trust overvalued its assets. Day is a pal of Clinton’s ex-Secretary of State Warren Christopher and once entertained the Democratic chief on his yacht.

James C.
Langdon, Jr.
JAMES C. LANGDON JR., Partner
Washington, D.C.
jlangdon@akingump.com
202.887.4044
fax: 202.955.7758
Practice Area:
Energy, Land Use and Environment
James C. Langdon Jr. is a partner in the energy, land use and environment practice group of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. in Washington and a member of the firm's strategic planning and management committees.
Mr. Langdon has spent most of his professional career working on oil and gas and energy-related issues. A native of Texas, he currently divides his time between the firm's Washington, Texas and Moscow offices, advising Western multinational oil and gas companies, as well as the governments and oil and gas enterprises of energy-producing nations. His practice encompasses the United States, Latin America, Europe and the former Soviet Union, including Central Asia. He is actively involved in the fields of privatization and international project finance and in dealings with international financial institutions. He participates in the major international and geopolitical energy questions of the day. He also is active in dealing with energy-related issues that come before the U.S. Congress.
Earlier, Mr. Langdon focused on energy regulatory issues before various administrative and regulatory bodies of the federal government, such as the Departments of Energy, Interior and Treasury. Before joining Akin Gump in 1975, he participated in the process that led to the creation of the U.S. Department of Energy, serving as associate administrator for the Cost of Living Council's Petroleum Division, director of the Office of Commercial Affairs for the Department of Treasury, and associate administrator of price regulation development for the Federal Energy Administration.
Mr. Langdon received his B.B.A. in 1967 and his J.D. in 1970 from the University of Texas. He is a member of the District of Columbia and Texas Bars. He has presented numerous papers to various energy law groups, including the Southwestern Legal Foundation Institute on oil and gas law and taxation.

(Bush `Pioneer’)
Langdon heads the energy practice of this corporate law firm, representing multinational oil and gas companies, as well as oil-producing foreign nations. He helps these clients cut financial and privatization deals. Although he is not a registered lobbyist, Langdon involves himself in energy-related issues before Congress. Langdon is a personal friend of Bush, who has taken a lead role in his beltway fundraising. In this role, Langdon was on the hot seat after Bush spent more than half of the record $68 million he had raised by the time of the New Hampshire primary—and still got trounced by John McCain. “People have been questioning, `Where are we on the spending?’” Langdon said at the time. “There’s a decent amount of that kind of discussion. You can’t get beat like that and not have this happen.” Langdon’s father was a Texas Railroad Commissioner during the `60s and `70s. During this oil regulatory agency’s energy-crisis hey day, the three powerful commissioners acted as a mini-OPEC, controlling how much oil Texas produced.

Research Interests
Engineering Risk Management and Decision Analysis. Professor Paté-Cornell's current research uses risk
analysis, probability, and decision theory to integrate organizational factors into assessments of the reliability of the final product or service, and to allow efficient and cost-effective risk management in industry, and in government regulations. Recent applications: NASA space shuttle, management of unmanned space programs, offshore platforms, marine pipelines, anesthesia in hospitals.

Pete Wilson is a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution. He served as the thirty-sixth governor of California (1991- 1999), the culmination of more than three decades in the public arena that included eight years as a United States Senator (1983- 1991), eleven years as mayor of San Diego (1971-1983), and five years as a California state assemblyman (1967-1971).
As mayor of San Diego, Wilson led the transformation of that city from a quiet navy town to an international trade hub, amending the city charter to make public safety the first and foremost responsibility of city government and leading a successful effort to manage San Diego's dynamic growth and to revitalize the city's downtown area. He substantially cut the property-tax rate and imposed a limit on the growth of the city budget that became a model for California's subsequently adopted Proposition 4.
As a United States senator, Wilson was a leading voice for a stronger defense and U.S. foreign policy. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he called for early implementation of President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, a national ballistic missile defense system.
Wilson also cosponsored the federal Intergovernmental Regulatory Relief Act requiring Washington to reimburse states for the cost of new federal mandates. And his fiscal conservatism in the Senate earned him "Watchdog of the Treasury" honors for each of his eight years in the nation's capital.
Wilson's eight years as governor saw California emerge from the depths of depression to a resounding economic recovery. Inheriting the state's worst economy since the Great Depression, Wilson remained focused on California's long-term priorities.
Governor Wilson enacted historic education reforms that have been called California's "education renaissance" -- reforms based on results, accountability, and fiscally sound investments.
Wilson demanded and got rigorous curricular standards, implemented class-size reduction, and ended social promotion, replacing it with early, effective remedial education. He also began new programs of individualized testing of all students, teacher-competency and training, a lengthier instructional year, and a return to phonics and early mastery of early reading, writing, and mathematical skills.
Born on August 23, 1933, in Lake Forest, Illinois, and raised in Missouri, Wilson attended Yale University and proceeded to serve three years as a United States Marine Corps infantry officer. Upon completion of his military obligation, Wilson earned a law degree from the University of California, Berkeley.
