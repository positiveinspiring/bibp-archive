# A Perspective about Donald Trump, the FBI Director and North Korea, 
you'll Never See from Mainstream Media

The secret
government, corporate and financial control, the relationship
between big business and government, false flag terrorism - these
are all important things to be aware of when contemplating what's
really going on with the presidency, particularly since the
mainstream media is painting another picture entirely.
"The media's the most powerful
entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty
and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power.
Because they control the minds of
the masses."
One thing is for
certain, regardless of how much mainstream media and "the
establishment" praise or denounce a president, very little
actually changes.
The same agenda
seems to continue being propagated, and a great quote comes to mind
here:
"Democrats and Republicans are two
wings of the same bird, and the flight path doesn't change."
A Perspective on
Trump You Won't Hear From the Mainstream
Bombs are still
being dropped, and the terror war industry is still running rampant
under the Trump administration, just as it was in previous years.
"Islamic Terror" is
still cited as a problem, without any mention of the fact that
Western intelligence agencies have had their hand in creating false
flag terrorism to heighten the
national security state for a long time.
These powers
orchestrate events, like creating
fake terrorist videos, or even arming the very terrorists they
are claiming to oppose, to justify military intervention into other
countries.
"The global war on terrorism is a
US undertaking, which is fake, it's based on fake premises.
It tells us that somehow America
and the Western world are going after a fictitious enemy, the
Islamic state, when in fact the Islamic state is fully supported
and financed by the Western military alliance and America's
allies in the Persian Gulf...
They say Muslims are terrorists,
but it just so happens that terrorists are Made in America."
The fact that
Donald Trump seems to support and continue on with the terror war
industry, as those before him did, suggests he is just another
puppet or part of this powerful cabal looking to establish their New
World Order.
On the other hand,
prior to his election he did reference
Barack Obama and
Hillary
Clinton as being key catalysts in the creation of ISIS. Are we
seeing the same thing we saw with Al-Qaeda?
He also called out
election fraud and political ties to big finance, something that was
further revealed by Wikileaks who, all of a sudden, became a Russian
source of misinformation for the first time in a decade, with
absolutely no proof.
If anything, other
information from whistleblowers and declassified documents from
other sources lend even more credibility to Wikileaks.
"The truth is, there is no Islamic
army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed
intelligence officer knows this.
But, there is a propaganda
campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an
intensified entity representing the 'devil' only in order to
drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership
for a war against terrorism.
The country behind this propaganda
is the United States."
Robin Cook, former
British Foreign Secretary
source
The fact that Trump
even mentioned this is both shocking and confusing given that, on
the surface, it seems he fully supports this war that's based on
fake premises.
And his comments
on Hillary and Obama's ties to ISIS, despite being ridiculed in the
mainstream, actually have a lot of evidence behind them.
So perhaps when it
comes to this so-called war, Trump has some inside intel we are not
aware of.
On the other hand,
Trump has and continues to go against the will of some very powerful
people. Obama, Clinton, and Bush all seem to be, in my opinion, easy
and willing puppets for the corporations, but Trump is not.
This is exactly why
you'll always see Donald Trump bashed by the corporate media.
Richard Dolan
sums it up quite well.
For more than a year, we have been told that Trump is a racist,
sexist, xenophobe, liar, cheat, and narcissist.
The attack bears
all the marks of a coordinated effort among the major news
outlets:
CNN, NYT, WaPo, HuffPo, USA Today, and the rest.
It reminded me very much of the concerted media
attack against Brazil's Dilma Rousseff which culminated earlier
in 2016 in her impeachment and removal from power.
In the case of Rousseff, we see what has been alternately
described as a soft coup or a
Wall Street coup, rather along the lines of the "color
revolutions" of a few years earlier (which are now largely
understood as
CIA-NGO orchestrated).
In both cases, pretexts were created and hammered home by an
insistent media that whipped up public opinion. In Brazil, it
worked.
It seemed like it would work in the U.S.
It is important to understand why Trump was demonized. To be
sure, his character makes it easy. There is no shortage of
narcissistic, sexist, or otherwise offensive statements in his
repertoire from which to draw.
But I have never and will never believe this is why he was
demonized. Ultimately, Trump is a disruptor, and his disruption
falls squarely against the two key pillars of the American
ruling elite's ideology:
neoliberalism and neoconservatism.
Unlike traditional liberalism and conservatism, neoliberalism
and neoconservatism are not opposites.
Neoliberalism is just another name for transnational
globalization, while neoconservatism is nothing other than the
U.S.-dominated global empire project.
They work together, two inhuman, anti-human processes that
ensure a tiny minority of people control and own all the water,
minerals, drugs, GM foods, and everything else worth owning in
this world.
Hillary Clinton, as the ultimate representative of such an
agenda, received unwavering support from all segments of that
establishment, certainly from the media. Trump, on the other
hand, was vilified.
Trump is not a
New
World Order global empire builder. He does not bother trying to hide
his flaws or look good for the public.
I do not support
Trump, and clearly he has done and said a lot of crazy things,
but he is not in the pockets of these elite, and they are responding
to his defiance by bashing him every chance they get.
This includes,
The corporate media
looked on and praised
George Bush for what was done in Iraq, as well
as what was done to Libya under the Obama and Clinton
administrations, despite the fact that these horrors were enacted
based on lies and greed.
Past
administrations caused the wreck of a nation and the destruction of
millions of lives, yet Trump spoke out against all of these and
remains a villain, while Obama won the Nobel "Peace" Prize...
It doesn't make
much sense, does it?
The
power
mainstream media has over our perception of major events, people,
and more
is truly astonishing.
Trumps has spoken
out multiple times against the big businesses and corporate media
that control American politics. He has also
dismantled
the TPP and raised concerns over
the fraudulent science that could be coming from the EPA and other
government organizations.
Trump was made to
look like a fool for pulling his funding from the EPA, but the EPA,
just like the FDA, has become a cesspool of corruption.
Many medical
professionals have spoken out against the close ties between
corporations and science, and how much of our published science
today could actually be completely false.
This would be in
order to approve the pesticides that are sprayed on our food, or
the glyphosate that's found practically everywhere now.
I'll bet you
didn't hear that perspective from the mainstream media, did you? Instead, we simply
heard that Trump doesn't care about the environment, without ever
realizing that neither does the EPA!
To learn more and
to see one out of many examples, you can read about
Genetically Modified Foods and the
fraudulent science used to approve them.
He is also speaking
out against
vaccines.
The above are
multiple reasons why Trump has probably been the most vilified
president in United States history, but that's only because all
we've been presented with is that perspective.
A
Perspective on the FBI Director You Won't Year in the Mainstream
According to Michel
Chossudovsky, an award-winning author, an emeritus professor
of economics at the University of Ottawa, and the founder and
director of the Centre for Research on Globalization (CRG):
The
recommendation to fire Comey did not emanate from the White
House.
It was an
initiative of US Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy
Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who prepared a three page
memorandum, which criticized James Comey for his handling of the
Clinton email investigation and the release of his October 28,
2016 Second Letter to Congress 11 days before Election Day.
The Attorney
General's office visibly acted in defiance of the White House.
He recently
published an article (Who
Was Behind The Firing of FBI Director James Comey? What
Political Interests Are Being Served? Who Is Andrew McCabe?) on his website.
Chossudovsky argues
that this has been a propaganda campaign to draw even more negative
attention toward Trump, with the goal of getting him impeached.
The firing of Comey was intended
to weaken the president
and provide ammunition to the
smear campaign against him.
The Attorney
General's recommendation to fire Comey will eventually backlash
on President Trump in the context of the Russia Probe, namely
the investigation into the FAKE collusion between Moscow and the
Trump campaign.
This is indeed the
perspective of 'experts' that you will never hear from the
mainstream media.
Any type of
information presented against the mainstream media narrative will
always be attacked, and that's important to keep in mind.
North Korea
As mentioned
earlier,
Vladimir Putin is not the only one who called out
global media and the elite, claiming that they use "imaginary and
mythical threats" to control us.
In an age plagued
with false information, why should we continue believing everything
we receive from corporate media?
So much "fake" news
has been dished out by these networks on a number of topics, like
9/11 for example, that it's nearly
impossible for anybody to determine what is real and what isn't.
As a result of
these controversies, mainstream authorities decided to designate a
"fake news checker."
But this only
created more backlash, because people understand that the solution
is not to censor the information that people see, but rather teach
them how to assess that information using critical thinking skills.
If our source of
truth has become a television screen, we are in big trouble. We
should all be able to determine what constitutes "fake news" and
what a credible source is. We don't need
Snopes.com doing it for
us.
When it comes to
North Korea, we could be seeing the same situation as we are seeing
with Iran and Syria, or what we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan. There
always seems to be some major threat that requires our military
invention, but we never hear anything from the other side. Anyone
who questions the mainstream media narrative is made to look
ridiculous.
But can you blame
the average person? Especially with all of the negative propaganda
within the mainstream media, as well as the entertainment industry?
What we know of
North Korea simply comes from corporate media telling us "it is like
this."
Most of these
mainstream media stories pertaining to global events are still
believed by many, and the fact that the simple suggestion that they
may be false or misleading is greeted with harsh criticism tells us
a lot.
A viewpoint that
differs from the mainstream narrative should hold equal
plausibility, especially in the face of a narrative that simply
comes from mainstream media intelligence, which is usually
considered evidence.
It can be hard to
entertain the idea that what we are being told about major global
events isn't entirely true, and that the wool has been pulled over
our eyes. At the same time, all of the information leading to this
belief is backed up by tremendous amounts of evidence.
It didn't just come
from anywhere, which gives you something to think about.
Concluding Comments
We
believe there to be a
massive shift in consciousness currently
taking place.
One important part
of this shift is a change in how we see, feel, and think about our
world. Information alone has played a huge role in opening up our
minds to new possibilities that once didn't fit the accepted
framework of knowledge.
As time moves on,
we are questioning what it is we are doing here, and starting to
wake up to the fact that not everything is as we've been told.
Much of what was
previously labeled as a "conspiracy theory" now has significant
backing and evidence behind it.
Confronting and
acknowledging the deception that currently exists in our world is
not easy, and some of it is so downright unbelievable that the human
mind simply isn't ready to accept it. Nevertheless, it's just
information.
It's our mind that labels it "good" or "bad" without
stopping to realize that it's all just one human experience, but
that which does not resonate with us is something we clearly want to
change.
So much of the
misinformation, corruption, and greed underling almost all aspects
of our lives is now becoming visible, and as a result, our
perception of the planet is changing.
And as a result of
that perception shift, physical material reality is also beginning
to shift and we are starting to manifest a new human experience.
Obviously, this is
a process, but it's happening right now and we're currently living
in it.
