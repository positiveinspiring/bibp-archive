In Homs, Syria,
but meant for the world at
large.
People the world over have been stunned into
silence by what we have done to the planet just
since 9-11.
However, this goes back much, much further to
everything that was done under
Clinton
and
G.H.W. Bush as well. Because that's
when the Gates of Hell were opened and when we officially began to
unleash this permanent reign of terror upon the world.
The concept itself began with our wars against the native population in
which more than 50 million natives died, over the course of 400 years of
this scorched earth policy.
The slaves in the states shared the same time
frame but because each slave was worth real money the numbers that died were
smaller. The crimes against them were horrific just the same.
By the time that G.W.H. Bush arrived in the oval office, having come
directly from
the CIA, he still had many loose-ends to finish.
After he locked up Noriega in the Dry
Tortugas, in Florida and after he began the Iraq war against Saddam in 1991,
which were meant to destroy all evidence of his war-crimes, plus his
drug-running and weapons trafficking.
Bush 41 set the stage for Clinton who
allowed the slaughter in Rwanda, followed by Bosnia-Herzegovina which is not
even close to being rehabilitated.
Then came Bush 43, illegally by appointment in December of 2000 by the U.S.
Supreme Court followed, by 911 and the rejuvenation of the first War on Iraq
that was never concluded.
By 2003 junior declared the continuation of
the War on Iraq, supposedly for Weapons
of Mass Destruction which was never a factor, in that conflict, because
all those WMD's that were sold to Saddam by Rumsfeld had been
either moved or destroyed by 2003.
Yet when the administration finally admitted
that there were no Weapons of Mass Destruction the war continued
uninterrupted, despite the fact that the reason for that war had never been
a factor.
By the time of the wars labeled as "The Arab Spring" which were just cover
for a number of regime-changes throughout the Middle-east and financed by
George
Soros; the current Scorched Earth Policy went into immediate
effect, throughout the Middle East.
Promises were made about Freedom & Democracy to nations that had previously
had neither.
While these illegal wars were continuing the
United States underwent a total conversion to
a
corporate Stazi-State that wiped out the U.S. Constitution and
turned the US over to the criminal-Israeli regime which had been covertly
directing US policy for decades before they went public under G.W. Bush.
Amerikans get their "news" from the tube. That source has been
criminally
controlled since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.
Here's what CNN was supposed to report on worldwide and was supposed to look
like today. This report comes from RT and is just one of several daily
worldwide reports issued every day.
They are thorough and they present a totally
different view from any US media assigned to cover the world today:
When the world looks at our brutality and the blood-thirsty wars, all we can
see are the results, worldwide that have left virtually every country we've
touched in ruins.
Drinkable water, viable electricity and any
other "services" have been decimated, millions of refugees are created and
millions upon millions of people get slaughtered in every country we
"attack" supposedly to prevent terrorism.
Instead of "Terrorists" we
slaughter "Insurgents" to the point that we have now labeled most of the
U.S. population as "insurgent enemies of the State". The State here is a private-corporate fascist
Stazi-State that remains virtually at war upon the rest of the world (see "Insurgents "R" Us").
Now with the ongoing war
inside Ukraine, all of that "war" is being waged by
US mercenary forces, combined with Nazis-forces, NATO and
United
Nations military forces
that are about to swing into action against Russia for "creating" the
violence inside Ukraine.
But as you can see from the RT report above,
there are consequences for each and every sanction that we continue to place
on Russia, as 'the instigator' of all of the violence in the region. Nothing
could be further from the truth.
What is perhaps worse that the minute to minute news of the world is the
fact that apparently Amerika remains totally unaware of what we actually
leave behind in our blood-drenched wake. The nations we attacked had
excellent technologists, teachers, medical services, and first rate
educational services Iraq was light years ahead of the United States
before we began bombing it.
The same was true
of Libya and
Syria, but Amerikans never bothered to find out the facts behind any of the blood-baths
we initiated in the name of Freedom & Democracy.
If we go back to what we began with our wars upon the native population here
it's easy to see where Israel got its template for their treatment of the
Palestinians, which amounts to 66 years of a totally Scorched Earth policy.
Our supposed allies are the military arms of fascist global-bankers who are
still trying to wring their blood-stained profits from the left-over ruins
from our mutually used Scorched Earth Polices worldwide.
Where is the public in all of this? We have supposedly changed politicians,
several times in order to get different policies here in the States. But not
only does nothing change, our policies continue to get much, much worse.
For instance,
Obama
promised to close
Gitmo in his first year in office.
Yesterday he got approval for over 69 million to build another Gitmo on the
same site in Cuba.
It currently costs over $900,000 to care for
each prisoner in the current facility
"House
committee earmarks $69M for new secret prison at Guantanamo
08 May 2014
Some members of Congress want to build a new secret prison
for the alleged 9/11 mastermind [George W. Bush/Dick Cheney?] and other
former CIA captives at Guantanamo, a project once proposed by the U.S.
Southern Command but then dropped because of a lack of support from the
Obama administration.
Republicans at the House Armed
Services Committee inserted 69 million for the new 'high-value detainee
complex' in its
spending bill
Wednesday night that earmarked a total of
93 million for new construction
at the prison camps in Cuba.
At Guantanamo, the military
calls the complex Camp 7 and says it's built on a clandestine location
at the 45-square-mile Navy base and run by a secret U.S. Army unit
called Task Force Platinum."
The United States cannot feed its
own people.
Our infrastructure is in ruins. Our
people live in literal terror from our own police, yet nothing at all is
done to fix anything that matters. The police have become the true enemy of
the people inside the USA (see "Call the Police at your own Peril").
What makes this
portrait of Amerika
so ugly is that no one who 'matters' ever questions anything this government
does. Israel runs wild over the US government and does whatever they want
anywhere while we pay for everything they do. This is what will soon be left
to those of us that don't get any help to end this barbaric slaughter.
That's because if we don't learn to
come together soon, then we will die alone and there will be nothing
romantic about any of this
The criminality inside the
private-corporate states that run the Stazi-State is legendary and is
totally above and beyond any of the so-called laws they cite for the crimes
they commit by the hundreds every day.
American taxpayers are funding the
destruction of the entire world, while they continue to watch their games
and immerse themselves in toys and habits that have nothing to do with any
of the global-crimes we commit world-wide; each and every hour day and
night.
There are some suggestions below
about how we could almost easily change everything if the people were to
actually realize what's really going on
(see "Nullify U.S. Inc.").
Stop watching the poisoned Tube and
start going to real news sources if you want any information about what is
driving this world today; because that is the only way out of this
nightmare.
I heard from someone in England
today who mentioned that conditions in the space where most of the
satellites are, is beginning to look like a massive field of fleas.
She
mentioned that all of that will very soon be hit by some of those CME's that
most pay absolutely no attention to at all. This will appear as if the
universe will be shaking off a huge infection of fleas throughout our star
system.
When that happens it will be the end
of globally-corrupted communications, satellite tracking, aircraft,
sophisticated weaponry of all types, spying, the internet, all our
cell-phones and most of everything that has conned us into believing that
we're living in a technological age.
Overnight we could soon be in the
Stone Age, because of what's already been done to everything including our
atmosphere. The only good news in any of that is that
HAARP
would end, along with
Chemtrails and at least the weather could
return to being just the weather
Think about it please....
