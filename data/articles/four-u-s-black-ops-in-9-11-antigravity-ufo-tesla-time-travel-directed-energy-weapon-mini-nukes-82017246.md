New computer analysis by UK researcher Richard D. Hall has revealed
that an
anti-gravity remote controlled UFO drone may have been used to hit
World Trade Center tower 2 on September 11, 2001.
Mr. Hall made this analysis public in two videos
set out in the Examiner article below.
Mr. Halls analysis of a possible an anti-gravity remote controlled UFO
drone used to hit the World Trade Center on 9/11 is the subject of an
exclusive ExopoliticsTV interview by Alfred L. Webre with UFO,
reverse speech and video analysis expert Jon Kelly (Vancouver UFO
Examiner).
According to Mr. Halls analysis, a remote-controlled anti-gravity UFO,
clearly visible in video footage, was intentionally guided into World Trade
Center tower 2 on 9/11. News and other video footage showing images of a
jetliner hitting WTC tower 2 is due, according to Mr. Halls analysis, to
after the fact editing.
Another remote-controlled antigravity UFO, according
to Mr. Hall was most probably guided into World Trade Center Tower 1.
Project Camelot whistleblower
Aaron McCollum has also revealed in that U.S. secret
antigravity craft that he traveled in possessed a stealth camouflage
capability to appear and sound like a commercial jetliner, such as a Boeing
747.
Jon Kellys analysis of the 9/11 antigravity UFO, which identifies the
September 11, 2001 false flag operation as a showcase for exotic military
technologies including black project UFO's is set out in the ExopoliticsTV
interview video far below.
A total of four advanced exotic technologies exclusively in the possession
of U.S. black budget military intelligence have now been inked to use in the
9/11 false flag psychological operation by an executive command and control
network that reaches to the,
Examiner reporter Alfred L. Webre has identified these four U.S.
black budget exotic technologies as key to identifying, planning and/or
carrying out the 9/11 false flag psyops:
-
9/11 remote controlled antigravity UFO
(Richard D. Hall, researcher; Project Camelot whistleblower Aaron
McCollum);
-
Quantum access Tesla-based time travel
teleportation to access images of 9/11 in 1971 (Andrew D.
Basiago, DARPA Project Pegasus whistleblower);
-
Directed Energy weapon (possibly
although not necessarily HAARP) for controlled demolition of World
Trade Center towers by molecular dissociation (Researchers Dr. Judy
Wood and another independent scientist)
-
4th Generation mini-nuke for
controlled demolition of World Trade Center towers (Independent
scientist).
The principal barriers to use of this prima
facie eyewitness, whistleblower and documentary evidence in criminal
prosecution of the perpetrators of the false flag operation of September 11,
2001 are:
-
A U.S. government truth embargo around
these black budget technologies
-
An active campaign by agencies such as
the National Security Agency (NSA)
to
disrupt the 9/11 truth movement,
and any prosecution of the true high level perpetrators of the 9/11
false flag operation, such as former U.S.
President George W. Bush, Vice President
Richard B. Cheney, and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld
-
A denial paradigm within the 9/11 truth
movement, the mainstream media, the international justice system,
and a significant constituency of the public that these exotic
technologies exist and may have been used by high-ranking officials
and individuals in the commission of the 9/11 false flag operation
The false flag operation of September 11, 2001
provided a
legislative, political and media pretext
for the launching of a worldwide
war on terror by the U.S. and allies, and
a domestic police state worldwide.
9/11 remote-controlled
antigravity UFO
ExopoliticsTV interview
In his ExopoliticsTV interview (below video), Jon Kelly states,
9-11 as a showcase for exotic military
technologies including black project UFO's. Why use a UFO to deliver an
explosives payload? The UFO is destroyed in the delivery process. Is
that a sign of advanced technologies, when your delivery vehicle is
destroyed on the first delivery? Why use a UFO, then cover it up with
video editing only to have it uncovered nine years later? Why not a
missile or a bomb?
Mr. Kelly continues,
By destroying the delivery vehicle in the
process of delivering an explosives payload to the WTC towers, one can
reduce the opportunity for witnesses to make sense out of the attacks.
According to Richard Hall's presentation, covering up the real events
with video manipulation was important to the controllers behind the
scenes of 9-11.
Mr. Kelly states,
The strategic model is not unlike a VBIED
or a truck bomb, where a truck filled with explosives drives to the
target then detonates.
Mr. Kelly concludes,
In Richard Hall's version of events, a
VBIED in the form of an exploding UFO strikes the WTC. Mr. Hall clearly
demonstrates that the raw video of this event was edited using masks and
layers to produce a fictional visual account of the events of 9-11 for
distribution as news by the major media. The raw video, sourced from a
VHS recording is not a high resolution recording. However, it does
convincingly display a metallic, reflective saucer-shaped vehicle in a
steady, controlled descent into the WTC tower.
In the ExopoliticsTV interview, Jon Kelly
states,
Mr. Halls hypothesis also resolves
long-standing questions regarding the pod-shaped object protruding from
the bottom of the jet airliner as it crashes into the tower. Mr. Hall
describes the pod as the remnants of the UFO saucer mixed with the
overlayed jet airliner video image. The overlay did not subtract the
saucer from the frame, but combined it visually with the airliner.
Mr. Kelly concludes,
If this very expensive technology was
deployed for this purpose, it represents extreme hubris and arrogance on
the part of the deployers. Why did they need to do that? To show off to
themselves? To show off to someone else? As an ultimate act of
perversion?
They perverted the flow of tax dollars from the average
citizens to develop secret technologies which they then used to secretly
seize control of society and launch illegal wars.
9/11 - Showcase for
exotic military-intelligence technologies
9/11 as a multi-dimensional false flag psyops appears to have been designed
as a showcase for the leading edge of U.S. black budget
military-intelligence technologies.
Quantum access Tesla-based time travel
The first among these exotic technologies was
quantum access Tesla-based time travel technology,
developed in DARPAs
Project Pegasus (1968-72) under the policy oversight of
then Nixon cabinet member Donald H. Rumsfeld.
Mr. Rumsfeld was later to play a pivotal
operational role in the 9/11 false flag as U.S. Secretary of Defense on
September 11, 2001.
A key whistle blower,
Andrew D. Basiago, has emerged with
evidence that secret U.S. time travel technologies were used as early as
1971 to acquire first-hand documentary knowledge about September 11, 2001 -
fully three decades before the horrific events of that fateful day.
Mr. Basiago, a child participant in DARPAs time travel program, Project
Pegasus, has publicly stated how in 1971 he viewed moving images of the
attack on the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001 that had been obtained from
the future and brought back to the early 1970s.
DARPA
is the chief research and development arm of the US military, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency.
DARPA created the precursor to the Internet,
Arpanet, and has a penchant for trumpeting its advances, such as putting
surveillance cameras on the backs of bumblebees and other exotic
achievements in military science.
Mr. Basiago claims that DARPAs secret technical accomplishments go far
beyond what it has publicly acknowledged and that by 1970 DARPA had achieved
teleportation-based
time travel as well as advanced
electro-optical means of discerning past and future events via different
technologies that provide quantum access.
Mr. Basiago
has described how while serving in Project
Pegasus, he viewed moving images of 9/11 at the secured U.S.
defense-technical facility where they were processed after being retrieved
from the future, the Aerojet Corporation facility that once stood at the
corner of Bullock Avenue and Leroy Place in Socorro, New Mexico.
According to Mr. Basiagos whistleblower testimony,
Donald H. Rumsfeld, the sitting U.S.
Secretary of Defense on September 11, 2001, was the defense attaché to
Project Pegasus during the early 1970s, when Mr. Rumsfeld was officially
serving as a counselor to President Nixon and member of his Board of Wage
and Price Stabilization.
In all likelihood, Mr. Rumsfeld, as the defense attaché to Project Pegasus,
would have known about and possibly had control over the data about 9/11
derived via quantum access and brought back to the early 1970s for
analysis by the DARPA research and development program under his
administrative authority.
Mr. Basiagos eyewitness account that Secretary Rumsfeld and others knew
about 9/11 decades in advance because data about it was gathered via DARPAs
secret time travel program unlocks several of the more enigmatic facts in
the 9/11 literature and may be the key to societys unraveling of the
ultimate accountability for the false flag operation that took place on
September 11, 2001.
Andrew D. Basiago
answers questions about Project Pegasus and 9/11
Source
Q: Why would the US take part in
9/11?
Andrew D. Basiago: What I know is that in the early 1970's,
Project Pegasus had moving images of one of the planes hitting one of
the Twin Towers on 9/11; that 9/11 was known and spoken of by project
principals; and that the defense attaché to Project Pegasus was Donald
Rumsfeld, the individual who was serving as Defense Secretary during
9/11.
The evidence from Project Pegasus shows that
the US government knew about the 9/11 attacks many years in advance, not
necessarily that it "took part" in those attacks.
Q: If Project Pegasus knew about 9/11 before it would happen, why
wasn't 9/11 prevented from occurring?
Andrew D. Basiago: That's a good question. What I know is that it
was the consensus of the US officials administering Project Pegasus that
information about future events should be used to engage in contingency
planning for future events but not to "play God" and change the future
by preventing or altering future events.
A paradox exists such that acting to change
future events based on prior knowledge of them results in diminished
accurate knowledge of future events.
So, there is an institutional reluctance to
change future events based upon prior knowledge of them because of the
impact of doing so on the quality of the intelligence database
concerning future events.
Q: How much information about the future has Project Pegasus
learned about?
Andrew D. Basiago: My experiences in Project Pegasus indicate
that by 1970, the US government was using chronovision to capture
remotely and record on film a vast amount of footage of past and future
events. When we visited the project location at Flemington, NJ - where I
was shown remote images of the signing of the US Constitution in 1787
and saw George Washington and Benjamin Franklin as they appeared in life
- we could see that the technicians there were filming reams and reams
of scenes of past events on 16 mm film stock and storing it in film
canisters. Presumably, this process is done digitally today.
Q: Is Project Pegasus still active?
Andrew D. Basiago: I do not know whether Project Pegasus is still
active, but the intelligence infrastructure that evolved from it is in
all likelihood very active at this time. Project Pegasus was a small,
highly secret research and development program launched in the late
1960's.
However, the technologies that it developed
gave the US government the keys to past and future events.
My guess is that the quantum access
capabilities that Project Pegasus provided the US government are now
headquartered at some form of national intelligence center that provides
the President, the intelligence community and the military information
about future events.
Q: Was just the military involved or was the government also
involved?
Andrew D. Basiago: Project Pegasus combined individuals employed
by the US military (Navy, DARPA), the US intelligence community (CIA)
and civilian defense contractors (e.g., Parsons). It was a research and
development program of the US Department of Defense (DoD).
Q: How could a father actually put his son through all of these
violent and possibly fatal transportation experiments?
Andrew D. Basiago: It is my position that my father and I were
proud to serve our country during its hour of maximum danger and were
also privileged to be involved in America's early activities in
time-space exploration.
My father did not involve me in Project
Pegasus. Rather, we were approached by the US government and told we had
to be involved for reasons that remain a mystery.
In all likelihood, we were identified by
project personnel from the future, who knew from the perspective of
their time that we had been involved in the program, and hence we were
brought into the program to create the future program that had knowledge
of our past involvement.
Q: Why was not an adult the one transported so that the
information brought back might be more precise?
Andrew D. Basiago: Children were involved for five main reasons.
-
First, we were experimental test
subjects into the physical and mental effects of teleportation
on children.
-
Second, we were necessary
participants because the holograms produced by the chronovisors
would collapse if adults were involved and so small,
cooperative, intelligent human beings were needed as the time
travelers in the chronovisor probes, and therefore a decision
was made to involve gifted and talented American school
children.
-
Third, we were regarded as better
participant-observers of the past and future events accessed in
the program because children are tabula rasa - blank slates
whose perceptions are not skewed by the selection bias produced
by their previous experiences.
-
Fourth, we were trainees who were
expected to become America's first generation of "chrononauts"
in a fully fledged time-space program when we grew up.
-
Fifth and lastly, the Department of
Defense found that when adults were involved in time travel, the
psychologically destabilizing effects of moving between
alternate time lines was causing some adult time travelers to
become insane, so it was hoped that by training time travelers
from childhood a competent cadre of US time travelers could be
formed.
Q: How could a child possibly be put
through all of this and also remember everything he saw or even
understand what he saw or heard?
Andrew D. Basiago: I am a gifted individual with exceptional
powers of observation and memory. These gifts were identified when I was
being trained in Project Pegasus. In one test, I recited back random
numbers provided to me verbally to 84 places.
I was identified as the future whistle
blower about Project Pegasus even while I was still serving on the
project. I have spent over 10 years investigating my experiences and
proving them to an historical certainty. I am an individual who did
remember what I saw and heard, so it is not valid to say that I couldn't
have done so because a child couldn't or shouldn't have been able to.
That involves the fallacy of using the
general to refute the specific. I not only remembered much of what I saw
and heard, but I later wrote it down and went back and investigated it
and proved my memories.
Consequently, I am now able to provide an
insider's account of the US government's time-space program at the time
of its emergence in the late 1960's and early 1970's.
Scientist - Directed energy weapons turned
World Trade Center into nanoparticles on 9/11
Evidentiary sample:
directed energy weapons & WTC buildings.
One researcher draws on Dr. Woods work (below audio) and sets out a sample
of documentary and witness evidence sufficient to conclude that an advanced
directed energy weapon was used on the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings on
9/11.
9/11 documentary
evidence of use of directed energy weapons at WTC
-
Seismic Record:
The energy budget recorded in the
seismic record on the day of 9/11 and the collapse of the WTC
buildings did not reflect the mass of building materials involved in
the collapse, nor the nearly freefall of the collapsing buildings.
The seismic record demonstrates an event on the scale of a quarry
blast. Where was the thud [that would have accompanied a WTC
building collapse]?
-
Kinetic Energy:
Two robust WTC buildings with very
robust steel beam reinforcement would release a sizeable amount of
kinetic energy from the buildings falling - that would be all of the
energy that went into the construction of the WTC buildings. The
release of that amount of kinetic energy is not reflected in the
physical evidence on the seismic record. Into what physical process
did that kinetic energy go?
-
Molecular Dissociation:
The collapse of the WTC buildings
produced the highest mass per volume of very fine particles (nanoparticles)
ever measured in an air sample in the United States. It takes a
tremendous amount of energy to dissociate or break the molecular
bonds of steel, concrete and other building materials that were
powdered into very fine particles during the collapse of the
buildings.
The largest mass per volume of metals
ever measured in an air sample in the US were reported by Dr. Thomas
Cahill who did air monitoring for 5 months. Metal is used in
buildings because it is very strong - and would require large
amounts of energy to reduce it to nanoparticles.
Chemical explosives do not release
enough energy to produce that volume of very fine particles. A much
more energetic process was involved such as laser or beam energy
which releases focused and concentrated energy as complex waveforms
necessary to cause molecular dissociation.
-
Physical Evidence of Buildings
Collapsing:
In videos of the collapses on 9/11 the
WTC buildings erupted into emulsion like a drinking fountain, and
the rubble did not hit the ground. Even on tape huge pieces of
aluminum building siding vaporized as they were freefalling, and
never hit the ground.
-
Controlled Demolition:
The [collapse of the WTC buildings] was
not a 'controlled demolition' for the following reasons:
-
WTC Detritus Pile
Should have
been 1/3 the height of the WTC buildings. The 100+ story WTC
buildings were about 1 story high when the collapse of the
buildings ended. A fireman on one of the news videos said the
antenna that had been on the top of WTC Building 1 was on the
top of a pile of rubble about one story high. The rubble pile
should have been 35 stories if it was a conventional controlled
demolition.
-
WTC Rubble Never Hit the Ground
This defies gravity, where did the rubble go?
-
Footprints
Geometrically Round
Holes: contiguous round holes 24 in diameter were in the
footprints of the WTC buildings 1 and 2, and a 60 deep
geometrically round hole was in the middle of Liberty Street
near the WTC. This is evidence of beam weapons. There was no
debris inside the footprints of the two WTC buildings, only bare
dirt with circles in the dirt.
-
Dust
In videos of the collapse
larger particles fell and cascaded down from the buildings under
the forces of gravity, but before they hit the ground they
vaporized and suddenly went up into the atmosphere like an
antigravity demonstration. Nanoparticles are so tiny that they
are not subject to the forces of gravity, so molecular
dissociation occurred on the larger particles as they were
freefalling, reducing them into nano-particles (0.1 microns in
diameter and smaller) that suddenly obeyed other physical laws
of quantum mechanics. More evidence of [directed energy weapon
or] HAARP/beam weapon technology applied during collapse.
-
9/11 Satellite photos
[9/11
satellite photographs showed] dust going into upper atmosphere
- which had to be nanoparticles and may have been enhanced by
other technology because most very fine particles/dust would
stay in the Troposphere and be rained out in 2 months as we know
from depleted uranium particulate releases from battlefield
already.
-
1400 Toasted Cars
Located blocks
from the WTC buildings, with door handles missing, engine blocks
missing, blistering on some parts of the car finish, strange
rust patterns on the bodies of the cars.
-
Paper Around Cars Not Burned
"Whatever vaporized the engine blocks and the door handles on
1400 cars did not ignite fragile and flammable paper lying all
over the ground around the cars. If engine blocks and door
handles selectively vaporized, why didnt body of car vaporize?
-
Pile of Cars Spontaneously Combusted
In a news video, the entire pile of cars started burning
spontaneously at the same time with no visible cause, it was not
a fire that started in one car and spread to others.
-
Rust Occurred Immediately
On cars
and trucks, and in FEMA photos there was heavy rust on steel
beams - steel does not rust, and it is a slow oxidation process
that results in rusting of iron. This rusting happened
immediately.
-
Basements of WTC Buildings Undamaged
Stuffed mannequins in the basement of WTC with clothing on
were carried out of the basement undamaged. If a 100+-story WTC
building collapsed into its basement and left a 35-story rubble
pile, there would be nothing left in the basement. Even
streetcars underground at the WTC were pulled out after the
collapse and had no damage.
-
Prof. Cahill Air Monitoring Samples
The hardest and most durable materials vaporized (steel,
concrete etc), and the most fragile materials (paper) cascading
out of WTC windows and all over the ground for blocks were
undamaged.
-
Truckloads of Potting Soil
Right
after the WTC disaster, the ground was fuming, and sequential
FEMA aerial photos show 130 dump trucks full of soil (filled
almost to the top of the dump truck space) covered with tarps so
that the dirt in the trucks was not visible to onlookers on the
street, coming into the WTC area, dumping the soil and going out
for more. This happened even before the rescues or cleanup
started and it continued for some time. The piles of soil were
left for a week and got higher each day in sequential photos.
The soil fuming lasted until March 2002 (8 months).
-
Boots Disintegrated
Boots on
emergency responders disintegrated after 2 hours. They had to
get new boots every 2 hours - an effect of molecular
dissociation. It was not from burning, their skin would have
been damaged.
-
No Ground Fuming During Rain
For
99 days the burning (fuming) continued at the WTC site, but
when it rained there was no fuming. If it had been fires
burning, the rain would have caused steam from heating
rainwater.
-
USGS: Iron versus Steel
The USGS
analyzed the mineral form of the rust on steel beams and iron
objects at the WTC. They did not address the steel does not
rust issue, but dodged it by referring to the rusted steel
beams in the rubble pile as iron beams and gave mineral
analyses of iron minerals produced by oxidation.
-
Official Sample Data Not Reliable
Spectral absorption images at the WTC indicated average
particle size was about 1 micron, which is subjected to gravity
and would have fallen with the collapsed buildings. USGS did not
collect many dust samples and collecting samples by other
different agencies did not agree with each other. No samples
were taken at the toasted cars.
-
Directed Energy Weapon Evidence
Evidence of use of a directed energy weapon was present at the
top of the WTC buildings as lathering up started before
buildings started coming down. Lathering up in videos preceded
the collapse of all buildings, even Building 7 which supposedly
Larry Silverstein when he said, 'Pull it' to firefighters meant
controlled demolition. Color alteration and modification in news
videos compared to other photos/videos at tops of buildings
indicates doctoring of images. When the Seattle Dome was
destroyed with controlled demolition, the dust created by the
destruction did not get any higher than the top of the building.
The WTC dust got into the upper atmosphere almost immediately -
which indicates very tiny atmospheric dust sized particles (0.1
micron and smaller), in fact smaller than atmospheric dust that
stays mainly in the Troposphere.
-
Lathering Up Incriminating
WTC
Building 7 lathered up even before WTC Building 2 went down.
WTC Building 7 not damaged at all by WTC Building 2 going down -
right next to each other.
-
Freon tanks
Very odd, large tanks
were removed from WTC building and OSHA made bogus statement
about what and why they were removed. Was Freon used in WTC
takedown? A NYC cop whom the researcher met with Cindy Sheehan
said he was injured in WTC Building 7 and removed on a gurney,
but his eyes were covered so he could not see anything as they
left the building. He reported he was able to see dead bodies
lying all over the floor as he was being carried out - before
building 7 had collapsed. Was this due to Freon asphyxiation put
through ventilation system like in a recent Russian submarine
disaster?
This
prima facie evidence of the use of U.S.
exotic black budget technologies in 9/11 can bring the perpetrators of 9/11
to justice.
The prima facie eyewitness, whistleblower and documentary evidence now
available that these four exotic black budget technologies in the sole
possession of the U.S. military-intelligence sector is sufficient to bring
the perpetrators of the false flag operation of September 11, 2001 to
justice under the following provision of the U.S. constitution, and related
criminal laws for non-U.S. citizens who were perpetrators of the false flag
operation of 9/11.
Article III (3) of the U.S. Constitution provides:
"Sect. 3. Treason against the United States,
shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their
enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of
treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act,
or on open confession in open court."
