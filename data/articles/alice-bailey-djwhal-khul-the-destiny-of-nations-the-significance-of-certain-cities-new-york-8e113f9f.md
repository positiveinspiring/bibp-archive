The Destiny of the Nations - The Significance of Certain Cities
The force expressing itself through the center,
New York
, is the force of the sixth Ray of Devotion or Idealism. Hence the conflicts everywhere to be found between the varying ideologies, and the major conflict between those who stand for the great ideal of world unity brought about by a united effort of the Forces of Light, backed by the cooperative effort of all the democratic nations, and the separate materialistic attitude of those who seek to keep the United States from assuming responsibilities and her rightful place in world affairs. This latter group, if they succeed in their endeavor, will deny the United States her share in the "gifts of the Gods in the coming age of peace which will succeed this present point of critical suspension," as
The Old Commentary
phrases it. The sixth Ray is either [98] militant and active, or mystical, pacific and futile, and these two aspects at present condition the United States. The keynote of this world center is "I light the WAY;" this is the privilege of the States if its people so choose and permit worldwide humanitarian, self-sacrifice (self-initiated) and a firm decision to stand by righteousness to govern their present attitudes and policies. This is slowly coming to pass and the selfish voices of the blind idealists, the fearful and the separative are dying out. All this is happening under the inspiration of service, motivated by love. Thus the two major democracies can eventually restore world order, negate the old order of selfishness and aggression and usher in the new order of world understanding, world sharing and world peace. Peace will be the result of understanding and sharing, and not the origin of them, as the pacifists so often imply.
