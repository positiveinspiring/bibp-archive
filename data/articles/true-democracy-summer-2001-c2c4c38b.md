Bechtel Corporation
CIA's main contractor for covert projects and experimental underground
bases.
In addition to this, Bechtel is an engineering company which is noted for
having friends in high places. In fact, there is a good book about Bechtel
entitled, Friends In High Places authored by Laton McCartney. In it,
Mr. McCartney states how Bechtel management influenced the CIA to depose the
leader of Syria replacing him with the dictator in order to allow them to
build a pipeline where they desired.
The previous Syrian leader wouldn't allow this so he was conveniently deposed.
Bechtel could do legitimate work saving employees' jobs. We have to make
this company accountable to us. No company deserves to do covert projects
or build underground bases. They're just not needed.
