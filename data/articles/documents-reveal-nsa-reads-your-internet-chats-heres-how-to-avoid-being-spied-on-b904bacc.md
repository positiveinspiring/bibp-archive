Fresh documents
reveal that
the NSA is
spying on your internet chats through
a highly
secretive operation known as
PRISM (much like PRISON).
Heres how you
can go about protecting your privacy.
The NSA utilizes the cooperation of major
corporations in order to team up and gather all of your information - even
in real time.
They are able to
see everything you
write through Facebook, Google platform tools like Google Talk, Skype chats,
Apple, and other top companies. So what can be done? Well, first of
all we need to find alternatives to these top internet juggernauts.
Chances are you may have already figured that
this day would come when its open knowledge that these massive corporations
have been shoveling your information into the government privacy furnace,
but perhaps you werent sure the best course of action.
Lets get into the very first line of defense
against privacy-crushing corporations and the government that feeds upon
your intimate conversations online.
Securing Your Personal
Chats
As of right now, the leaked documents detail how
the NSA is targeting the big guys.
Google and Facebook, for example, hold upwards
of 90 percent of the real bulk of spying interest. What does this mean for
you? Well, they have yet to go and soak up the little guys that use much
more advanced technology to deliver a message from point A to B.
And better yet, encrypted chatting plugins make
spying on your personal chats within one of these smaller companies beyond
difficult.
The Internet
Juggernauts Are Watching
The most important thing to remember is that
even if youre protected behind a billion IP masks and encrypted
technologies, the moment that your message hits the servers of Skype or
Google (through chatting on their platforms through Skype chat or Gmail),
they will have access.
Thats why we need to discuss protected chat
programs, or at least better options.
Even The Guardian, the publication that released
the documents, explains that the NSA appears to have failed
at conquering companies like,
-
Vine
-
LINE
-
Viber
-
Kik
-
KakaoTalk
Whether
or not that is true does not necessarily matter, as we are going past that. Vine, for example, is large enough that it is
certainly on the NSAs list of domination.
That, and were talking about an app that
doesnt go the extra mile to encrypt your communications.
Practical Options
Instead, here
are some steps to get on a protected chat program for mobile and PC.
One that isnt large enough for the NSA to
bother with and protects your chats without use of major servers:
Off the Grid:
Abandon Skype, Google Chat, Facebook chat,
and all of the top clients like AIM.
This is obvious, but you need to at the very
least use Pidgin with the encryption plugin if you need to remain active
on these chat programs for whatever reason.
Even with Pidgins encryption, though,
youll still be going through the servers of internet titans like
Google.
For your computer:
A free chat client like
Cryptocat is light
years beyond what youre experiencing
with Google and
Facebook.
Cryptocat is free, very simple, and uses your browser to chat with
others. Its also encrypted.
For your phone:
Get something like
Seecrypt for your phone.
The idea behind this app is that you can
chat with others who use Seecrypt and are also encrypted. This bypasses
the use of the mega chat servers, as its all through the encrypted
Seecrypt channels. This app is $3 which is very cheap for encryption
tech, and it is also relatively unknown.
These two qualities make it a worthless
target for the NSA.
Protect your
internet sessions:
If you dont already have the service, try a
VPN (Virtual Private Network).
The way a VPN works, which you can actively
choose to log into on your computer through a program (so it doesnt
have to be on 24/7 if you dont want it to be), is that it encrypts your
internet sessions by using an external server.
This protects your sessions from spying of
all forms, but it does not protect your actions in regards once again to
the mega servers.
For example, even if youre on a VPN but
still chatting
on Facebook, it doesnt make a difference (because
Facebooks server is still capturing your chat while youre logged in).
A VPN is ideal to use with something like Crypto.cat, protecting your IP
as well as your chats.
Protect
your search:
Check out an engine like
Startpage,
which encrypts all of your searches and apparently does not record your
IP address.
Following the NSA leak, independent hosting
and email providers are already changing the way their services work in
order to workaround the spy grid.
Database administrator Cameron Fillers
of California-based
Komputer King
hosting services told Storyleak:
Komputer King has ongoing efforts to
secure its end users privacy and security. One of the methods by
which they support this feature, is by offering e-mail accounts
using their dedicated
Zimbra Servers.
Zimbra is a professional E-mail Server
system that allows you to login and access your e-mail using SSL in
order to send e-mail securely, and is not handled by anyone else.
Zimbra also has the unique ability to offer private Instant
Messaging using XMPP.
At $2 dollars per e-mail account (which
doubles as your IM account), you are able to send e-mail and chat
completely off the grid in a secure environment.
You can use a client like Pidgin to
connect to the Zimbra server.
At the end of the day, these steps are effective
but only a precursor to privacy activism.
And most importantly, its essential that you
stop putting up with the NSA spying on you and your family. The
ultimate goal is to inform the public that the government should not be
pushing us into fear, nor have us hiding from the corporations
that hand over all of our personal data to the government.
Use these practical tips to protect your
privacy on the web, but be sure to understand that the ultimate goal is to
restore our fundamental freedoms.
