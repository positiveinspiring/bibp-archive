An extended interview with Julian Assange
recorded during filming of John Pilgers latest film
The War You Dont See.
The attacks on
WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, are a response to
an information revolution that threatens old power orders, in politics and
journalism.
The incitement to murder trumpeted by public figures in the United States,
together with attempts by
the Obama administration to corrupt the law and
send Assange to a hell hole prison for the rest of his life, are the
reactions of a rapacious system exposed as never before.
The U.S. Justice Department has established a secret grand jury just across
the river from Washington in the eastern district of the state of Virginia.
The object is to indict Julian Assange under a
discredited espionage act used to arrest peace activists during the first
world war, or one of the war on terror conspiracy statutes that have
degraded American justice.
Judicial experts describe the jury as a deliberate set up, pointing out that
this corner of Virginia is home to the employees and families of the
Pentagon, CIA, Department of Homeland Security and other pillars of American
power.
