Prominently displayed in the
lobby of the Bank of Americas Corporate Center are
creepy frescoes, filled with occult symbols.
Even more unsettling is the
fact that those images seem to predict events of a
radical world change in the not-so-distant future.
Are those murals predicting
the coming of an occult New World Order?
We will look at the occult
meaning of the symbols found on the Bank of America
frescoes.
A reader of Infowars sent me pictures of some
very odd murals displayed at the Bank of America Corporate Center in
Charlotte, NC. Needless to say they immediately caught my attention, as I
was flabbergasted by their symbolism and their message.
I also couldnt help relating them to the
ominous murals of the
Denver International Airport.
Painted by Benjamin Long, the paintings are said
to revolve around the themes of making/building, chaos/creativity, and
planning/knowledge in a daring blend of abstract and realism, set
off with touches of gold.
The three frescoes
ruling over the lobby of
the Bank of America
Corporate Center.
Although we normally read from left to right,
there are clues within the frescoes hinting the viewers to read the
paintings from right to left.
The planning stage (visually represented by
the fresco on the right) is normally the first step of any process so it
would make sense to start from there. There is also alchemical symbolism
hinting towards the chronology of the frescoes, so we will begin with the
one on the right:
Right Fresco
The fresco on the right is dubbed
Planning/Knowledge. An esoteric read of its symbolism reveals exactly
what is being planned and what knowledge it is referring to.
Masonic Boy on Masonic Floor
We see here a young blond boy standing on a
standard Masonic checker-board pattern floor. His feet are placed at a 90
degrees angle, in accordance to Masonic initiation ritual:
Q.
On your return to the Lodge, where were you placed, as the youngest
Entered Apprentice?
A. In
the northeast corner, my feet forming a right angle, my body erect, at
the right hand of the Worshipful Master in the east, an upright man and
Mason, and it was given me strictly in charge ever to walk and act as
such.
- Malcolm C. Duncan, Duncans Masonic Ritual
and Monitor
Seemingly underneath the boy are people dressed
in business suits, seemingly strategizing while pointing at the Masonic boy.
Does the boy represent the new generation?
This blond boy is very reminiscent of the blond
boy featured at the center of one of the murals of the Denver International
Airport.

sword into a plowshare.
Note that the boy is
wearing a traditional Bavarian costume
perhaps as in Bavarian
Illuminati?
Burning Bush, Woman in Cube and
Pyramid
Symbolism overload
Behind the boy is a tree on fire, which is a
reference of the Burning Bush of the Old Testament.
The Burning Bush is of great importance in
Masonic ritual, especially for the 33rd degree, whose members are considered
to be near the Burning Bush.
In the
third Exodus it is record that, while Moses was keeping the flock of
Jethro on Mount Horeb, the angle of Lord appeared unto him in a flame
of fire out of the midst of a bush, and there communicated to him for
the first time his Ineffable Name.
This
occurrence is commemorated in the Burning Bush of the Royal Arch Degree.
In all systems of antiquity, fire is adopted as a symbol of Deity; and
the Burning Bush, or the bush filled with fire which did not consume,
whence came forth the Tetragrammaton, the symbol of Divine Light and
Truth, is considered in the advanced degrees of Freemasonry, like the
Orient in the lower, as the great source of true Masonic light.
Wherefore Supreme Councils of the Thirty-Third Degree date their
balustres or official documents, near the B.B. or Burning Bush, to
intimate that they are, in their own rite, the exclusive source of all
Masonic instruction.
- Albert G. Mackey, Encyclopedia of
Freemasonry, Part 1
In the background is an Egyptian pyramid, the
ultimate symbol of the Mysteries in occult teachings.
A strange feature of the painting is the woman
apparently trapped inside a transparent cube, hanging from threads coming
from the sky.
Does she represent the common man, stuck in the
confines of the material world (occultly represented by the cube) and
manipulated by unseen the forces from above?
Stairs and Black Sun

On the left of the image are stairs, apparently
leading to the heavens, a classic symbol representing the path to
illumination/Illuminati through the mysteries of Masonry.

Masonic floor to the outside
In the sky is a black sun, another symbol of an
esoteric significance. Hermetic traditions teach the existence of two suns,
an invisible and etheric one made of pure philosophical gold and the
material one, the only one the profane can perceive, known as the Black Sun.
In alchemy, the black sun (Sol niger) is the
name of the result of the first stage of the Opus Magnum. The
alchemical Magnum Opus (or Great Work) starts with the blackening - the
calcination of crude metals - and ends with their transmutation into pure
gold.
Today, the symbol of the Black Sun is mostly
associated with esoteric Nazism and cults such as the Temple of Set. It is
also found in odd places such as:
Bracken House, London.
The Black Sun beares the face of Winston Churchill.
and, once again, the
Denver International Airport.

The right fresco therefore seems to portray the
first step of a Great Work that needs to be accomplished, as symbolically
represented by the black sun.
Men dressed in suits (one of them oddly looks
like
Adam Weishaupt), seem to be preparing a
new generation of Masonic youth. Meanwhile, the profane seem to be idling
in an translucent cube, controlled by invisible puppeteers.
Middle Fresco
The middle fresco,
Chaos/Creativity, depicts a turbulent
transitional period.
Many details within the
painting describe this profound turmoil,
which seem to be
affecting all part of society and civilization.
We find military and
religious figures, people protesting and much more.
Barb wires, nets and
soldiers on the streets tell the viewers
that this period of
turmoil is also one of oppression.
The nun does not seem
very pleased either.
At the left of the
painting is a person wearing a biohazard suit,
hinting to some kind of
chemical warfare.
Person in gas suit
For this reason, and
many more, I find this painting
very similar to one of
the Denver Airports murals
the most infamous one.
This mural of the DIA
portrays a militaristic figure
wearing a gas mask and
oppressing an endless line of sad people.
Chemical warfare,
military repression, dead babies
what is there not to
like about this image?
If we look at the top
of the fresco, we see translucent beings spinning with fire,
perhaps implying that
the turmoil is also happening on a metaphysical, cosmic or astral level.
Spinning naked bodies
in a vortex of fire
This round fiery shape can also be likened to a
sun. Its pale golden color and the transparency of its figures can be
associated with the intermediate step of the great alchemical work named
Whitening.
Jung compared this step with daybreak, the
preparation for the next and final stage, which is the sunrise,
characterized by the color red. Which is, of course, the most prominent
color of the left fresco.
Left Fresco
The fresco on the left is said to focus on the
theme of Making/Building.
The main figure of the fresco is a worker
holding a shovel, contemplating the work done. In his back pocket is a red
piece of cloth, a symbolic detail in the context of this image.
There is indeed a great emphasis on the color
red in this fresco, which, as mentioned above, is the also the color
associated with the final step of the alchemical Magnum Opus: Rubedo,
the Red Work.
In occult teachings, alchemical transformation
can happen on numerous levels: a material level, where crude metals are
transmuted to pure gold, but also on a spiritual and philosophical level,
where the profane man becomes a regenerated man.
In secret-society lore, the entire world is
considered to be the subject of alchemical transformation; it is said to be
an imperfect plane needing to be transmuted into gold in order to mirror
the heavens, in accordance with the hermetic axiom As Above, So Below.
Is a
New
World Order the Great Work of the occult elite?
Sleeping Giant
Is he dead or sleeping?
And what does EQ mean?
An odd detail of the fresco is this man blending
with the earth, apparently in deep sleep
or is he buried?
This is also reminiscent of the (unsettling)
sleeping little boy on the DIA murals.

What Is The Meaning of the
Frescoes?
Like most elitist art, the frescoes on display
at the headquarters of Bank of America, the largest bank in
America, tell a story intended to be decoded by those in the know.
The frescoes seem to depict three stages of
world transformation - planning, chaos and achievement - and are color-coded
to be analogous to the three stages of hermetic alchemy:
-
Nigredo (blackness)
-
Albedo (whiteness)
-
Rubedo (redness)
The frescoes bear many resemblances to
the
murals of the Denver International Airport (DIA), which also depict progressive
phases of a profound transformation of society after a period of intense
turmoil.
The first fresco displays a wide array of occult
symbols, some directly referring to Freemasonry. This is quite astonishing
as the painting is in the lobby of the headquarters of the United States
most predominant bank and not in a Masonic lodge
but perhaps there is some
overlap.
Those who are in the know and initiated to the
Mysteries are those who are qualified to accomplishing the planning process,
which in this painting seem to be the men in suits, whose ties match the red
and white checker-board floor, and who make plans for the future generation,
represented by the blond Masonic boy.
In the second fresco, civil unrest, riots,
protests and repression are all taking place. Historically, the masses only
usually go into an outright revolt when their living conditions deteriorate
significantly or when hugely unpopular policies get adopted. Does this piece
refer to the loss of civil liberties and the rise of a police state?
There is also a metaphysical aspect to the
image, represented by the spinning naked bodies that appear as the sun,
implying that the period turmoil is also happening on a cosmic level.
The last fresco gives a sense of mission
accomplished, with the dominant figure surveying the work, while also
conveying the message that the work is never totally done as labourers are
still hard at work in the underground.
This is reminiscent of the movie Metropolis,
where a class of workers silently slave away underground to sustain the
elites utopia.
I also cant help but being reminded of the
33 Chilean
miners while looking at those workers
In Conclusion
The Bank of America frescoes are yet another
example of the elites agenda being hidden in plain sight.
These giant images, on display for all to see,
but designed to be understood by few, describe the philosophy of the elite
rulers, their occult knowledge and their plans for the future. As it is the
case for all works of art, it is possible to interpret these paintings on
numerous levels and to come up with different conclusions.
It is, however, difficult to ignore the
recurrent themes found in Sinister Sites:
prevalent occult symbolism, the heralding of
a new era, contempt for the profane masses, celebration of repression
and war, etc.
When comparing the Bank of America frescoes with
the art of the DIA and
the Georgia Guidestones, we can find a
definite consistence in their symbolism, their tone and their message. This
leads me to believe that the same group is behind all of those sites and
many more.
Whoever they are, we know a few things for sure:
they are extremely rich, extremely powerful
and they dont really like you
because you are not one of Them.
