# Why I Like Barack Hussein Obama

Barack Hussein Obama may yet turn out
to be the best thing that ever happened to the United States of
America.
Obama has been caught in lie after lie. His National Security
Advisor has stated he takes his daily orders from
Henry Kissinger, the one man widely
viewed as the architect of our disastrous Foreign Policy, the
policy which has done so much to turn foreign extremists into implacable
enemies.
Obamas cabinet reads like a roster of secretive societies such as the
Council on Foreign Relations,
The Trilateral Commission and the
international
Bilderbergers. His cry of change now
rings hollow.
Obamas policy of continuing unrestrained illegal immigration will
destroy the last vestiges of national cohesion. Gun-control legislation
pending in Congress will eviscerate the Second Amendment. The new Food
Safety Modernization Act will eventually outlaw private gardens. Soon
only the giant multinational corporations will control all food and
water.
Obamas so-called Stimulus Package is widely viewed as throwing
non-existent money after bad while rewarding malfeasance.
Obamas brand of Marxist Socialism will continue to take from the
poor and give to the rich, betraying his supporters.
Obamas form of collectivism has socialized the banking system and now
the auto industry. Others will soon follow. More power is being gathered
into the federal government than could ever be imagined by his
predecessors.
In following a Socialist philosophy which proved so fatal to communism,
he has set the nation on a course for disaster.
He has helped further the dissatisfaction and disdain of the Executive
Branch engendered by Bill Clinton and
George W. Bush. It now joins the
Legislative Branch which already has an approval rating that dips into
the single digits. The Judicial Branch is packed with persons selected
by former leaders now viewed as incompetent, if not criminals.
But the activities of Obama and his followers may have finally broken
the illusion embraced by many Americans about the United States. They
now see the empty political rhetoric for what it as mere words
followed by the inaction, or worse, the opposite of what was promised.
Americans now more clearly see that individuals, working at the local
level, can take care of local problems better than a faceless, bloated
and entrenched bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.
More and more are realizing that citizens
must regain their rights as free individuals.
The spirit of individual liberty is once again alive in the
land. Many Americans today are putting aside the outdated
politically-correct notions of liberal vs. conservative and Democrat vs.
Republican. They are beginning to wake up to the fact that
a handful of super-wealthy individuals and
families, many with foreign entanglements, have long sought
to control the free Republic of the United States and bring it to its
knees.
Already, legislation to regain state sovereignty is moving in many state
capitols. After all, without states rights how can there be any
individual rights? Many Texans are even considering reclaiming their
Republic, a legal move fully justified by the articles which brought it
into the Union in the first place.
True freedom is on the move.
This is why I like Barack Hussein Obama.
