The moral insanity of
the
Terror War continues to spawn more violence, more extremism, more
repression, more injustice, and the total subversion of the "Western
values," all of which it is ostensibly designed to defend.
A
new piece by Patrick Cockburn in
The Independent provides a grimly illuminating look at this insanity in
action on a specific front:
Syria.
It's worth reading in full, but here is an
excerpt:
The Syrian war has turned into a Syrian version
of the
Thirty Years War in Germany four
centuries ago.
Too many conflicts and too many players have
become involved for any peace terms to be acceptable to all
It has become
increasingly obvious over the past year that al-Qa'ida type movements,
notably
Isis,
Jabhat al-Nusra and
Ahrar al-Sham, have come to dominate or can
operate freely in a great swathe of territory across northern Iraq and
northern Syria.
This gives Isis a vast hinterland in which it
can maneuver and fight on both sides of what is a largely nominal
Syrian-Iraqi border
Europeans have not yet woken up to the significance of these anarchic zones
opening up on the shores of the Mediterranean in Syria and Libya. This is
because the threat has been largely abstract but it is getting less so with
the attack on the Jewish Museum in Brussels by a French jihadi who had been
in Syria.
US and European politicians do not want to
explain why, 13 years after
9/11,
when the "war
on terror" was supposedly launched,
thousands of al-Qa'ida militants have been able to carve out enclaves so
close to Europe.
US and European politicians won't explain it
because any honest explanation would expose the emptiness at the core of all
their proffered reasons for the Terror War.
They can't explain it because the Terror War
system - including the increasing militarization and repression in their own
countries - has now become organizing principle of Western society.
Or rather, it is the latest incarnation of what
has been the guiding principle of Western society since World War II:
organizing society and the economy around
war, either active war or the ever-present "threat" of war (assiduously
exaggerated - or even manufactured - at every turn).
For government and big business, the immense
power and profit and control they inevitably accrued from conducting total
war on a global basis was far too enticing to give up once the war was over.
The full mobilization of society's resources for
war simply carried on; indeed, was expanded and amplified.
However, the war also had a life-transforming impact on many of its
survivors. The savagery and loss - and the class-effacing comradeship - they
had experienced during the war imbued millions of people with a burning
desire to change society for the better, to do away with the poverty and
injustices of the past, and build a better, more decent, more peaceful
world.
This spirit is evoked with remarkable power in a
new book,
Harry's Last Stand, by Harry Leslie
Smith, a 91-year-old WII veteran enraged to see the neoliberal
extremists that have held sway in the US and Britain for more than 30 years
sweeping away the progress toward a more just society that his generation
tried to build on the ruins of the war (some of Smith's writing can be found
here and
here.)
The power structure was forced to deal with these aspirations. And, yes,
some among the commanding heights shared these sentiments as well, to
varying degrees.
Thus for a a brief period - scarcely more than
two generations - there was an attempt to balance two opposing organizing
principles at once: war and human betterment. The presidency of Lyndon
Johnson was perhaps the apex - and tragic denouement - of this conflict.
Johnson's Great Society and War on Poverty
programs, and his muscling through of the Civil Rights Act, were
profoundly transformative for millions of people, and even with their
limitations and compromises could have laid the groundwork for a continual
refinement and recalibration of society in the general direction of justice,
opportunity and social peace.
But Johnson was also a product - and propagator
- of the war system:
a hawk, eager to "project dominance,"
subvert and overthrow "recalcitrant" states and employ violence on a
massive, indiscriminate (and lucrative) scale.
The Vietnam War destroyed his presidency,
crippled the momentum of his social programs, and accelerated the triumph of
the war principle.
Now those who remember what the world was like before the Second World War -
the ugly, despairing poverty and inequality that Smith writes about so
movingly - are almost gone. Even those of us who remember when the idea of
human betterment seemed a realistic possibility for society, a practical
goal to be pursued despite many difficulties, not a pipe dream scorned by
the "savvy," are fading away.
There are now generations well into adulthood
who have never known anything but the war principle and the neoliberal
ascendancy as "normality," the natural state of things.
Indeed, in a very few years, we'll see the first
generation of adults who will have lived their entire lives under the reign
of the Terror War.
The relentless assault of the elites who have
thrived under the war principle, increasing the unequal proportion of their
wealth and power to unimaginable levels, have left these new generations
very little to build upon.
On so many fronts, so many levels, they will
essentially have to start from scratch, re-discover old skills and insights
that have been lost, re-fight old battles, and of course, create new ways
of trying to go forward (like the Occupy movement).
And they will have to do it against a power structure that is far more
powerful, more pervasive and implacable than before. A power structure that
every day is darkening the future of its own children, creating a dystopia
of chaos and fear, of aggression and blowback, repression and revenge.
No leader can "explain" what is happening
because none of them can admit the truth: that the world they are making -
the world that has made them powerful, has lifted them up on a finely-meshed
web of interlocking
elite interests and will sustain them, and
their families, among the elite for the rest of their lives - is organized
around violence and loot.
Not security, not prosperity, not liberty, not
democracy, not justice, not peace. These are not the aims of the system,
these are not the products of the system.
The Terror War - and the concomitant degradation of society and individual
lives - shows in stark relief that the system is producing exactly what it
aims to produce: death, despair - and record-breaking profits.
