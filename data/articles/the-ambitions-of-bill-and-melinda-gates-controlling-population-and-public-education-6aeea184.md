# The Ambitions of Bill and Melinda Gates - Controlling Population and 
Public Education

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_win-micro-gates40.htm

Continuing their
commitment to controlling global population growth
through artificial contraception, sterilization, and abortion
initiatives, Microsoft founder and philanthropist,
Bill Gates and his wife,
Melinda, a self-described "practicing" Catholic, are now
attempting to control the curriculum of the nations public
schools.
Subsidizing the Common Core State Standards
in English language arts and mathematics, the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation has committed more than $76 million to support
teachers in implementing the
Common Core - a standardized
national curriculum.
This, on top of the tens of millions they have
already awarded to the National Governors Association and the
Council of Chief State School Officers to develop the Common
Core in the first place.
Working collaboratively with the Obama
administration, the Gates Foundation subsidized the creation of
a national curriculum for English and mathematics that has now
been adopted by 46 states, and the District of Columbia -
despite the fact that,
-
the General Education Provisions Act
-
the Department of Education Organization
Act
-
the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act,
...all protect states against such an intrusion
by the United States Department of Education.
The Common Core Standards were developed
by an organization called Achieve, and the National Governors
Association - both of which were funded by the Gates Foundation.
The standards have been imposed on the states without any field
testing, and little or no input from those involved in
implementing the standards.
In a post entitled "Why
I Cannot Support the Common Core Standards,"
educational policy analyst and New York University Research
Professor, Diane Ravitch, wrote that the standards,
"are being imposed on the children of this
nation despite the fact that no one has any idea how they
will affect students, teachers or schools
Their creation was
neither grassroots nor did it emanate from the states."
Ravitch is especially concerned about the content
of the curriculum - what she called the "flap over fiction vs.
informational text."
Rather than giving English teachers the freedom
to teach literature, the Common Core mandates that a far greater
percentage of classroom time be spent on "fact-based" learning.
Ravitchs concerns are shared by others.
For example, one teacher claimed that she had to
give up having her students read Shakespeare in favor of
Malcolm Gladwells Tipping Point because it was
"fact-based" and Shakespeare was not.
Of course, Tipping Point has a political
agenda.
Parents may be concerned if they were to learn
that Gladwell suggests such "facts" as the belief that parents
should stop worrying about their childrens "experimentation
with drugs," including cocaine because "it seldom leads to
hardcore use."
"Fact-based" books on climate change are also
replacing classic works of literature because they are viewed as
offering students an opportunity to learn "science."
Freakonomics - a book that has already been a favorite of
public school teachers - is preferable to Poe because students
will learn about the positive effects of abortion on reducing
crime rates by reducing the population of those more likely to
commit crime.
While the adoption of the Common Core was
"voluntary" by the 46 states that adopted it, it was well
understood by these states that they would not be eligible for
Race to the Top funding ($4.35 billion) unless they adopted the
Common Core standards.
The Gates Foundation was very much a part of
this.
According to Lyndsey Layton of the
Washington Post (December 2, 2012),
"the Gates Foundation invested tens of
millions of dollars in the effort
The Obama administration
kicked the notion into high gear when it required states to
adopt the common core - or an equivalent - in order to
compete for Race to the Top grant funds."
Valerie Strauss of the Washington Post
recently reported (February 26, 2013) that there is growing
resistance.
Alabama, for example, withdrew from the two
consortia that are working on creating standardized tests
aligned with the standards. Indiana, which adopted the Common
Core in 2010 under the state education superintendent Tony
Bennett, is now talking about a "pause" in the
implementation of the curriculum. Bennett was defeated in the
November elections by an educator who opposed Bennetts support
for the Common Core.
Now, there are concerns that the imposition of
the Common Core within the public schools could threaten the
autonomy of private schools, religious schools and home schools.
An op-ed published in the Orange County
Register by Robert Holland, claims that the Common Core
could,
"morph into a national curriculum that will
stifle the family-centered creativity that has fostered high
rates of achievement and growth for home education
Many private and parochial schools -
including those of the 100 Roman Catholic dioceses across
the nation, already are adopting the CCSS prescriptions for
math and English classes
Their debatable reasoning is that the rush of
most state governments to embrace the national standards
means publishers of textbooks and tests will fall in line,
thereby leaving private schools with no practical
alternatives for instructional materials."
According to October 8, 2012 article in Education Week by
Erik Robelin, it is not just Catholic
schools that are adopting the Common Core, some Lutheran and
other denominations of Christian schools are shifting to the
common core, including Grand Rapids Christian in Michigan
and the Christian Academy School System in Louisville, KY.
According to Robelin, parochial school
leaders claim that they must "remain competitive" with
public schools and now feel pressured to adopt the Core.
These are real concerns.
As Diane Ravitch points out,
"Now
that David Coleman, the primary architect of the Common Core
standards has become president of the College Board, we can
expect that SAT will be aligned to the standards. No one will escape their reach, whether they
attend public or private school."
On February 14, 2013, Missouri legislator Kurt
Bahr filed HB616 that prohibits the State Board of Education
from implementing the Common Core for public schools developed
by the Common Core Initiative or any other statewide education
standards without the approval of the General Assembly.
An increasing number of parents are voicing their
concerns.
For example, Tiffany Mouritsen,
a Utah mother, blogged that the
American Institutes for Research (AIR), the primary source for
Common Core testing is a major concern for her:
"AIR markets its
values which includes promoting lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transsexual agenda for teens, and publicizes its client list
(including George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates)."
In a column published in January, political commentator
Michelle Malkin calls the Common Core a,
"stealthy federal
takeover of school curriculum and standards across the country."
And, she maintains that the Common Cores,
"dubious college and
career read standards undermine local control of education,
usurp state autonomy over curricular materials, and foist
untested, mediocre and incoherent pedagogical theories on
Americas schoolchildren."
The Gates Foundation - Buying
Control
The promise of federal funds to states
in order to "encourage" them to adopt the Common Core is nothing
new.
Our government has been doing this both nationally and
internationally for decades. In a 2008 book entitled Fatal
Misconception, author Matthew Connelly writes that in the
1960s, President Lyndon Johnson leveraged food aid for family
planning during crop failures in India, thus creating an
incentive for the sterilization program.
Indias Ministry of
Health and Family Planning admitted that,
"The large number of
sterilizations and IUD insertions during 1967-68 was due to
drought conditions."
Eventually, more sophisticated incentives
such as bicycles and radios were used to encourage women to
accept sterilization.
Connelly writes that under Indira Gandhi
in the mid-1970s sterilization became a condition not just for
land allotments, but for irrigation water, electricity, ration
cards, rickshaw licenses, medical care, pay raises and
promotions.
There were sterilization quotas - especially for the Dalits (the untouchable caste) who were targeted for family
planning.
While the Gates Foundation has not been involved
in anything this coercive, they have indeed been very much
involved in giving aid to those countries willing to participate
in family planning initiatives. For nearly two decades,
the Gates Foundation has been generous in providing aid to more
than 100 countries - often coupled with family planning
opportunities.
Such aid is often framed as a way to foster
economic growth. In an article in American Thinker,
Andressen Blom and James Bell wrote that Melinda Gates made that
connection explicit in a speech at a population gathering that,
"government leaders are now beginning to understand that
providing access to contraceptives is a cost effective way to
foster economic growth."
Bill Gates revealed his own population goals in
February, 2010, at the invitation-only Technology, Entertainment
and Design Conference in Long Beach, California, when he gave
his keynote speech on global warming:
"Innovating to Zero!"
In a
youtube video available here, Gates stated that CO2
emissions must be reduced to zero by 2050 and advised those in
attendance that population had much to do with the increase in
CO2.
Claiming that each individual on the planet puts out an
average of about five tons of CO2 per year, Gates stated that,
"Somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to
zero
It has been constantly going up. Its only various economic
changes that have even flattened it at all."
To illustrate,
Gates presented the following equation:
CO2 (total population
emitted CO2 per year) = P (people) x S (services per person) x E
(average energy per service) x C (average CO2 emitted per unit
of energy).
Gates told the audience that,
"probably one of these
numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. Thats a
fact from high school algebra."
For Gates, the P (population)
portion of the equation is the most important:
"If we do a
really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive
health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15
percent."
Gates maintains that improvements in health care
- including an expansion of the administration of vaccinations -
will encourage families to reduce the number of children they
desire to have.
And, in an ongoing attempt to expand the types
of birth control, Gates has spent millions of dollars on
research and development. According to Christian Voice, a
few years ago the Gates Foundation awarded a grant of $100,000
to researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,
to develop a new type of ultrasound described as a "non-invasive
form of birth control for men" which would make a man infertile
for up to six months.
Such strategies have been effective.
In fact,
the Gates Foundation has been so successful in their family
planning initiatives that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
awarded their annual Population Award in 2010 to the Foundation.
According to a June 15, 2010 article in Mercator.net, at the
awards ceremony, UNFPA executive director Thoraya Obaid cited
the Gates Foundation as a,
"leader in the fields of global health
and global development, particularly in promoting excellence in
population assistance, including through the design of
innovative, integrated solutions in the areas of reproductive
health, family planning, and maternal and neonatal health."
The
International Planned Parenthood Federation is a previous winner
of the United Nations Population Funds Annual Award.
It is easy to understand why the United Nations
Population Fund - a fund which Steven Mosher, the President of
the Population Research Institute has exposed as being a direct
participant in Chinas coercive one-child policy - honored Gates
with their prestigious Population Fund award since the Gates
Foundation has donated more than one billion dollars to
"family-planning" groups including,
-
the United Nations Population
Fund itself
-
CARE International - an organization which is
lobbying for legalized abortion in several African nations
-
Save
the Children - a major promoter of the population control
agenda, the World Health Organization - an organization that
forcibly sterilized thousands of women in the 1990s under the
pretence of providing tetanus vaccination services in Nicaragua,
Mexico and the Philippines
-
and of course, the major abortion
provider, International Planned Parenthood Federation
Bill and Melinda Gates truly believe that
population control is key to the future.
Plans are already in
place to track births and vaccinations through cell phone
technology to register every birth on the planet. Gates claims
that the GPS technology would enable officials to track and
"remind" parents who do not bring their children in for
vaccines.
Maintaining that vaccination is key to reducing
population growth, Gates predicts that if child mortality can be
reduced, parents will have fewer children, following the example
of the urbanized West where birth rates have dropped to below
replacement levels:
"The fact is that within a decade of
improving health outcomes, parents decide to have fewer
children."
For Gates,
"there is no such thing as a
healthy, high population growth country. If youre healthy,
youre low-population growth
As the world grows from 6 billion
to 9 billion, all of that population growth is in urban
slums
Its a very interesting problem."
More than a decade ago, on May 17, 2002, the
Wall Street Journal reported that the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation had purchased shares in nine of the
largest
pharmaceutical companies valued at nearly $205 million.
Acquiring shares in Merck, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson Wyeth,
Abbott Labs, and others, the Gates Foundation continues a
financial interest in common with the makers of AIDS drugs,
diagnostic tools, vaccines, and contraceptives. But, the
commitment to global population control goes well beyond
financial interests.
It is likely that the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation will continue its commitment to
global
population control, and now, curriculum creation in
the nations
schools because they truly believe that they know better than
anyone else how we all should live.
A Product of Poor Catholic
Education
It is difficult to believe the claims
of Bill and Melinda Gates that they are not involved in the
abortion industry when you look at the relationships they have
with organizations like the International Planned Parenthood
Federation - the largest abortion provider in the world.
According to the National Catholic Register,
Melinda
Gates represents herself in the media as
a practicing Catholic
who has a great uncle who was
a Jesuit priest and a great aunt
who was an Ursuline nun who taught her to read. She graduated
from Ursuline Academy in Dallas, where she claims to have
learned "incredible social justice."
And, this may indeed be
where the problem begins.
For so many Catholics, social justice
has been so broadly defined that it now includes giving women
access to reproductive rights - including the right to abortion
- so that they can play an equal role in contributing to the
workplace and the economy.
In an article entitled "Why Birth Control is
Still a Big Idea" published in Foreign Policy in
December, 2012, Melinda Gates writes:
Contraceptives unlock one of the most dormant
but potentially powerful assets in development: women as
decision makers.
When women have the power to make choices
about their families, they tend to decide precisely what
demographers, economists, and development experts recommend.
Most recently, in a January 2, 2013 article
published on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation website
entitled "Profiles in Courage: Philippines Passes Reproductive
Health Bill," the article congratulates all of those who helped
bring expanded access to "reproductive health" through the
Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 -
recently signed by President Aquino.
This bill states that women
and men - living in the most Catholic of Catholic countries -
can now,
"decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of
their children."
What the Gates Foundation website omits
is information about the provision within the bill involving
"population management" through mandatory counseling of couples
seeking marriage licenses.
In this case, social justice involves
a demand that couples learn about the governments views on an
ideal family size of two children - coming one step closer to
China in its governments one-child policy.
This commitment to a distorted definition of
social justice by Melinda and Bill Gates will likely continue
because they have been lead to believe that such control is what
is best for people.
The Core Curriculum is really just another
component of population control - it is used to help teach
children the "facts" about climate change and problems of
over-population. Indeed, the population agenda is a trap that
many wealthy, highly intelligent people have fallen into in the
past.
From the wealthy eugenics supporters of Planned
Parenthoods Founder Margaret Sanger, to
the Rockefeller family
and their population control initiatives, this work continues
today through their heirs - heirs like David Rockefeller - an
ally of Bill and Melinda Gates.
And some influential Catholics
have been complicit in this.
At one time, Rev. Theodore Hesburgh,
President Emeritus of the University of Notre Dame served as a
trustee, and later, Chairman of the Board of the Rockefeller
Foundation, a funder of population causes counter to
the
teachings of the Church.
The population control initiatives promoted by
the Gates Foundation will continue to grow nationally and
internationally because they have convinced others and
themselves that they are saving lives.
On their website, they
ask:
"what is more life affirming than saving one third of
mothers from dying in childbirth?"
What they do not seem
to acknowledge is how many unborn children have died from their
initiatives.
