The United States had anticipated a revolution
in Egypt for some time, even if they predicted it would occur at the death
of their puppet, Hosni Mubarak. Consequently, they were standing
ready to step in.
From the first week of demonstrations in Cairo, Washington detached a team
from the Albert Einstein Institution.
A manual, already used in other countries,
was translated into Arabic and disseminated to shepherd demonstrators
towards the Twitter and
Facebook services set up the the State
Department and the CIA.
The manual provides precise instructions regarding the itinerary of the
marches. It contains diagrams and aerial views that differ from the aerial
representations made by the Egyptians, who rarely use maps in any case. The
aerial photos are credited, when in Egypt copyright rights are not
respected.
The manual offers tips on how to dress for protection against tear gas, but
displays a western model which overlooks local dress traditions.
On one of the illustrations, the character on the right was altered to show
a veiled woman, whereas the central character was changed from a military
into a policeman.
A poster reads:
"The police and the people against
injustice. Long live Egypt".
The message being put across was clearly one of
popular unity and fraternity with the police, but the conjunction in Cairo
was made with the army.
Unwittingly, the revamping of the illustration
reveals the haste and heedlessness with which the manual was adapted to
Egypt.
Moreover, the manual lays down the objectives that the United States
intended to impose on the movement: the toppling of Mubarak and civilian
governance. In particular, it aimed to bar any slogans against imperialism
or Zionism or those calling for the liberation of Palestine.
In the end, the scheme turned out to be a dismal failure.
