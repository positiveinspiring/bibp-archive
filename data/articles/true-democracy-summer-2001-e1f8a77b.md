Department of Justice self-financing
The use of confiscated money and valuables from "targets of investigation"
to finance "special projects."
This aspect at least of this department should be renamed, The Department
of Injustice because it causes justice to be denied. The very fact that Dr.
Boylan placed it in the Shadow government indicates that it is illegal, immoral,
and therefore, evil.
How many people have suffered because of this program which goes undetected
in the mainstream press. When the Department of Justice broke up AT& T,
which was a regulated monopoly which kept people's personal telephone bills
at a reasonable rate, how many people were unable to keep their lifeline to
the outside world with a telephone?
How secure can we feel when the Department of Justice files anti-trust action
against companies who may not have done any wrongdoing, simply because of
pressure to place funds in their coffers to fund "special projects?"
