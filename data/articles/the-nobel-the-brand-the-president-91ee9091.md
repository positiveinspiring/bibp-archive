Imprisoned by the most dangerous Zionist guards
People out there are divided whether
it was a right decision to award Obama with a Nobel prize for peace.
In fact, almost everyone around me is outraged, what 'peace' they ask,
what about Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, Palestine? We are tired of
promises they insist.
The Nobel Prize committee on its part
'highlighted Obama's effort to support international bodies, build ties
with the Muslim world, act in favor of
nuclear disproliferation and fight
Climate change'.
Those who are unimpressed with Obama stress
that the above is just 'empty rhetoric', nothing but 'hot air'.
"We want to see action, we demand facts
on the ground".
While Obama's critics raise some valid points,
they for some reason seem to fail to grasp the distinction between 'Obama
the Brand' and 'Obama the President'. The 'Brand' stands for hope and
humanism.
It tends to say the right things on the right occasions. It is ethically
aware. It employs reason occasionally and it even manages to talk sense
often enough. 'Obama the Brand' is, no doubt, a refreshing event in the
Western political arena.
'Obama the President' is a different story altogether:
'Obama the President' is a politician and
politicians are conditionally untrustworthy.
The failure of Obama to merge the 'Brand' and the 'President' into a
continuous ethical reality is indeed a colossal tragedy. But it is not Just
Obama's tragedy, it is actually our own disaster. As much as the 'Brand'
manages to spread some cheering humanist and universal statements, the
'President' is actually imprisoned by some of the most dangerous Zionist
guards.
'Obama the President' has a big open bill to pay
to the people who gave him the keys to his current white dwelling. In other
words he has many Zionists to appease and another bunch of rabid Sayanim*
that have managed to invade his office.
* Sayanim = Jewish tribal operators who happen
to work for Mossad or serve Israeli and
Zionist interests.
To a certain extent, Obama's failure to
establish an adequate continuum between the 'brand' and the 'president' is
due to the unfeasibility of a continuum between humanism and Zionism.
Unfortunately, within the Western liberal discourse there is no obvious
political means to confront the Zionist lobbies, and its infiltrators within
the American administrations or any other Western democracy.
Catastrophically enough, there is no practical or political means to stop
the Wolfowitzes from taking us into another illegal genocidal war.
Like in America, no one in British politics or
media is courageous enough to elaborate on the close ties between Blair's
cabinet and his party's leading fund raisers at the time when Britain was
taken into a Zionist illegal war in Iraq. The West in general and the
English Speaking Empire in particular have lost their survival instinct.
It would be right to argue that within the post WWII Liberal discourse we
lack the political apparatus to defend ourselves from the infiltration of
Zionist foreign interests.
By the time we are convinced that we have
managed to silence one Wolfowitz, five Emanuel Rahms pop out
in the background.
This is exactly where the Nobel Peace Prize comes into play.
Rather than waiting for Obama to launch another Zionist war, rather than
letting him nuke Iran just to make the Jewish state a 'safer place', they,
the Nobel Prize committee have hopefully pulled him in: they gave him their
biggest trophy in a very early stage of his presidential term.
They basically bounded him to his 'Brand' i.e.
hope, humanism, harmony and reconciliation.
They told him,
"listen to us Mr. President, here is your
trophy, once you accept it you may have to say NO to your Ziocons at
home, for people with a peace medal cannot launch wars."
Obama may have to find some other policies to
pursue peace rather than killing muslims.
Time will tell whether the Nobel Committee
gamble justified itself. For the mean time we may have to agree that the
Nobel Committee offered Obama an opportunity to bond the 'Brand' and the
'President' into a unified, dignified and ethical stand. Let's hope that he
takes the challenge.
As far as the Nobel Committee is concerned, this is probably the most clever
thing to do. The committee should have thought about it a long time ago.
Rather than waiting for too long, they should have awarded Blair and
Bush in the immediate beginning of their terms. This could have
saved the lives of millions of Iraqis and Afghans.
They should also have considered awarding
Shimon Peres with a Nobel Prize already in the 1950's, this may have
prevented him from building the
Dimona nuclear reactor and later
transforming it into a leading Zio-terminator.
Henry Kissinger? Very much the same, they
should have award him the peace medal on his
Brit Milah (circumcision) ceremony when he
was just 8 days old. This could have
saved the lives of millions.
Nobel Prize for Peace should be used as a preventative means.
Rather than wasting it on tedious humanists and boring peace lovers
who do nothing but making the world nicer, we should better employ it in a
preventative method. In current world affairs it should be used as an
induced commitment to peace so we can avert the risk of Zionist wars.
If I read it correctly, the Nobel Peace Prize is there to help 'Obama the
Brand' withstand the pressure posed on 'Obama the President' by his Ziocon
ring.
