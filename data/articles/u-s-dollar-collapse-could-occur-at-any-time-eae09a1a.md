China this morning reported 4.9% price inflation for the month of February,
exceeding analyst expectations of 4.8%.
With China now mimicking the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics and taking steps to artificially manipulate their
consumer price index (CPI)
numbers as low as possible, it is likely that real price inflation in China
is now closer to 10%. China was at least smart enough to raise interest
rates last month by 25 basis points to 6.06%, while the
Federal Reserve continues to leave interest rates near zero with
there being absolutely no talk of the Federal Reserve ever raising interest
rates again.
China will be successful at containing
inflation, as U.S. inflation spirals out of control and becomes the greatest
economic crisis in American history.
China this week reported a $7.3 billion trade deficit for the month of
February, its largest trade deficit in seven years, which surprised many
global economists. NIA believes China's trade deficit is temporary and that
China will quickly return to having a trade surplus.
The Federal Reserve's QE2 along with China's
destructive monetary policies, which artificially devalue the yuan, have led
to a massive rise in China's raw material costs this year.
NIA
believes that in the upcoming months, Chinese manufacturers will raise the
prices of their products that get exported to the U.S., to counteract rising
commodity prices.
With most products used by Americans today
having been manufactured in China, this will mean Americans will soon see
massive price inflation in just about all consumer goods they use. NIA
projects that by the end of 2011, we will begin to see the U.S. CPI increase
by 4.9% or higher on a year-over-year basis, with real U.S. price inflation
rising north of 10%.
The
mainstream media is proclaiming that
China's trade deficit will silence calls for the Chinese to allow their
currency to strengthen against the U.S. dollar. The fact is, China's
government has for long been making the major mistake of printing too many
yuan in order to artificially prop up the U.S. dollar.
Their fear was, if the U.S. dollar was allowed
to decline too rapidly, prices of Chinese goods would rise in terms of U.S.
dollars and Americans would no longer afford to import them.
The truth is, if China allowed the yuan to strengthen, the Chinese would
have enjoyed a much higher standard of living. Sure, prices would rise in
dollars and Americans would import less, but the Chinese would have the
ability to consume more of their own products. Now, as a result of China
expanding its own money supply in order to keep the yuan pegged to the
U.S. dollar, Americans will be forced to pay a much higher price for
Chinese goods anyway.
The same higher prices Americans were going to
pay as a result of exchange rate appreciation, Americans will now pay as a
result of inflation. For the Chinese, the exchange rate appreciation route
would have been a much better route to take than the inflation route,
because now the Chinese will also be forced to pay higher prices.
In the very short-term, China might actually
suffer more than the U.S. because they lack the social safety nets that have
been implemented here in America.
The U.S. government has been successful at temporarily paying off
Americans into 'not' rioting in the streets
like in Arab nations.
It was just announced a few days ago that the
number of Americans on food stamps in the month of December of 2010 was a
record 44,082,324, up 13.1% from one year earlier and 1.1% from one month
earlier. That is more than 14% of the total U.S. population!
Combined with President Obama extending
unemployment benefits up to 99 weeks, American citizens are too busy and
distracted playing with their iPad 2s and gossiping on Twitter about
Charlie Sheen, to have any time to protest in Washington, DC.
NIA believes the U.S. government's entitlement spending is currently having
the unintended consequence of making Americans dependent on government.
It is like when you take wild animals into
captivity and you feed them, teach them to do tricks and take care of them
for a period of many years; if you just dump them one day back into the
wild, it will be very difficult for them to survive.
Americans who have become dependent on
unemployment checks and food stamps will likely soon abruptly find out
that they must begin to fend for themselves without any help from the
government. The result will be many Americans turning into wild animals and
becoming so desperate that they will have to rob and burglarize their fellow
neighbors who were smart enough to prepare, or else they will risk starving
to death.
As a result of QE2, the Federal Reserve is now buying 70% of U.S.
treasuries, up from previously only buying 10% of treasury bonds. Foreign
central banks are now buying just 30% of U.S. treasuries, compared to
previously buying 50% of treasury bonds.
The U.S. budget deficit in the month of February
reached a record $222.5 billion or $2.67 trillion on an annualized basis.
With the Federal Reserve now monetizing our debt in full swing, a
complete and total loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar could be
imminent.
Just like how nobody in the mainstream media was calling for the collapse of
Egypt's government a few months ago, almost nobody in the media believes a
collapse of the U.S. dollar could possibly take place anytime soon. NIA
members are educated enough to see that the writing is on the wall.
The Federal Reserve can deny all it wants that
the U.S. is experiencing inflation, but with the cost to print a single U.S.
dollar paper note rising by 50% since 2008, massive inflation is here right
under Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's nose. Every day that
goes by, China is quietly implementing more and more steps that expand the
yuan's use in cross border trade, in order to position the yuan as the
world's next reserve currency.
So few Americans are presently preparing for hyperinflation that if
hyperinflation broke out today, approximately 90% of Americans won't have
the means to put food on the table or put fuel in their automobiles. During
the upcoming hyperinflationary crisis, food stamps will no longer have any
value at all and all U.S. entitlement programs will come to a complete halt.
Americans will take to the streets like the
world has never seen before.
The biggest question NIA has today is, will the U.S. government resort to
firing at its own citizens, if major riots take place in Washington, DC.
On Thursday, police in Saudi Arabia shot and
wounded three protesters. The price of oil rose by a few dollars per barrel
as soon as this news hit the wire, which shows just how nervous the world's
financial markets have become in recent weeks. The fact that the Dow Jones
has declined significantly in recent days, in our opinion means that the
odds of QE3 being launched
as soon as QE2 is over, are now much higher
than they were several weeks ago.
The other big question NIA has today is, if in the unlikely event there is
no QE3, who will fill in for the artificial buying demand currently coming
from the Federal Reserve.
After all, with no QE3, the Federal Reserve will
go from buying 70% of treasury bonds to being a seller of U.S. treasuries.
NIA is 100% sure that foreign central banks aren't itching to jump back in
to fill the hole.
While in the past, the private sector may have
picked up the slack, we believe individual investors will now be more
reluctant to jump into government bonds, especially with bond king Bill
Gross reducing the government bond holdings in his
Pimco Total Return Fund down to zero. The
bottom line is, no QE3 means interest rates will fly sky high and destroy
the phony so-called "economic recovery".
From April to August of 2010, the last time the Federal Reserve allowed its
balance sheet to shrink, the Dow Jones fell by over 1,000 points.
If Bernanke doesn't soon begin to leak out the
strong likelihood of QE3, we could see the stock market decline by 1,000
points or more, which will force Bernanke into launching QE3.
If we see a major sell off in stocks, NIA
doesn't necessarily think that precious metals prices will follow.
In fact, we could see gold and silver rise
along with the Dow Jones falling. NIA projects the Dow Jones to gold
ratio to decline to 6.5 in 2011. This means even if the Dow Jones fell to
below 11,000, we still believe gold is likely to rise to around $1,600 to
$1,700 per ounce this year, with silver soaring to around $42 to $44 per
ounce.
NIA believes the worst decision any American can
make is to sell their gold and silver and go long U.S. dollars, hoping to
buy their precious metals back at a lower price in the future.
