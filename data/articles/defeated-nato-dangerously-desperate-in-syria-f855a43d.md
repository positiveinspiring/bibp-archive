Did the West Gas Thousands
to Rescue Failed Syrian War?
As far back as 2007, it was a documented fact
that the West, including the United States and its allies Saudi Arabia and
Israel, conspired to use terrorists drawn from the ranks of
the Muslim
Brotherhood and Al Qaeda in an attempt to overthrow the governments of Iran
and Syria.
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh in his 2007 New Yorker
article, "The
Redirection," stated:
"To undermine Iran, which is predominantly
Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure
its priorities in the Middle East.
In Lebanon, the Administration has
cooperated with Saudi Arabias government, which is Sunni, in
clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite
organization that is backed by Iran.
The U.S. has also taken part in clandestine
operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria. A by-product of these
activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that
espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and
sympathetic to Al Qaeda."
Starting in 2011, this conspiracy was catapulted
into all out war - albeit behind the tenuous smokescreen of "pro-democracy
activists" and the so-called "Free Syrian Army" fighting for "freedom"
within and along Syria's borders.
Not only has this conspiracy been exposed, but it has categorically failed.
The Syrian government has routed even the most
dug-in terrorist proxies, making irreversible gains against a clearly
depleted enemy. While the US continuously threatens to "arm the opposition,"
it is a fact that any and all weapons, cash, and support the US had, it has
already sent over the last 3 years.
This includes untold millions in cash,
and literally thousands of tons of weaponry airlifted by the US and UK.
The US and its regional allies have also scoured the global extremist
networks they have built up over decades for every last fighter they could
possible find - all to no avail.
There is nothing left except direct military intervention, which cannot be
sold as helping an opposition now clearly exposed as being Al Qaeda. That
means, the humanitarian intervention, "right to protect" (R2P) must be
wiped clean of NATO's lies and crimes in Libya, and prepared for Syria.
Only what exactly could the West use to justify
an intervention against the Syrian government that is worse than what it and
its proxies have already done to tens of thousands of Syrian civilians?
With a victorious Syrian government mopping up NATO's terrorist proxies and
currently hosting UN chemical weapons inspectors in Damascus, the use of
chemical weapons now would defy all logic - from a tactical level, to a
strategic and political level.
Chemical weapons, according to the US military's
own reviews of their extensive use in the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980's,
reveal the true nature of chemical warfare - a truth the Western media has
all but avoided in their speculative and purposefully manipulative coverage
of the alleged incident.
A document produced by the US Marine Corps, titled, "Lessons
Learned: The Iran-Iraq War" under "Appendix
B: Chemical Weapons," provides a comprehensive look at the all-out
chemical warfare that took place during the devastating 8 year Iranian-Iraqi
conflict.
Several engagements are studied in detail,
revealing large amounts of chemical agents deployed mainly to create areas
of denial, not mass casualties. In the end, it is determined that
conventional weapons are by far more effective and more preferable.
The effectiveness and lethality of chemical weapons is summarized in the
document as follows:
Chemical weapons require quite particular
weather and geographic conditions for optimum effectiveness.
Given the
relative nonpersistence of all agents employed during this war,
including mustard, there was only a brief window of employment
opportunity both daily and seasonally, when the agents could be used.
Even though the Iraqis employed mustard agent in the rainy season and
also in the marshes, its effectiveness was significantly reduced under
those conditions. As the Iraqis learned to their chagrin, mustard is not
a good agent to employ in the mountains, unless you own the high ground
and your enemy is in the valleys.
We are uncertain as to the relative effectiveness of nerve agents since
those which were employed are by nature much less persistent than
mustard. In order to gain killing concentrations of these agents,
predawn attacks are best, conducted in areas where the morning breezes
are likely to blow away from friendly positions.
Chemical weapons have a low kill ratio. Just as in WWl, during which the
ratio of deaths to injured from chemicals was 2-3 percent, that figure
appears to be borne out again in this war although reliable data on
casualties are very difficult to obtain.
We deem it remarkable that the
death rate should hold at such a low level even with the introduction of
nerve agents. If those rates are correct, as they well may be, this
further reinforces the position that we must not think of chemical
weapons as a poor mans nuclear weapon.
While such weapons have great
psychological potential, they are not killers or destroyers on a scale
with nuclear or biological weapons.
Therefore, had the Syrian government used
chemical weapons and somehow was able to create the perfect circumstances to
create mass casualties, they did so solely to produce an abhorrent civilian
death toll and the perfect pretext for Western intervention, knowing full
well such weapons would be otherwise useless in battling armed formations.
Since Syria's chemical weapons would most likely be under the lock and key
of its most elite forces, as they are in Iran,
revealed in a RAND Corporation document, that would mean that their use
was approved by the highest ranking members of the Syrian government and
military - this would be the same government and military that exhibited
unlimited restraint against intentional and coordinated provocations carried
out by NATO-member Turkey and their regional partner, Israel - restraint
exhibited solely to avoid providing the West with the pretext for direct
military intervention.
Why then would the Syrian government choose now, of all times, to give the
West exactly what it was looking for, right as the window was closing on the
West to accomplish its goals versus Syria and neighboring Iran?
The answer is, the Syrian government did not use chemical weapons in
Damascus, or elsewhere.
And while the strawman currently being knocked down
by the Western media is whether the attacks were faked or real, the stark
reality is that NATO and its terrorist proxies most likely did expose a
large number of people to something, seeking mass casualties in a last ditch
effort to salvage what is clearly the end of their "Arab Spring" blitzkrieg.
As previously reported, NATO and its proxies in Syria have both the
means and the motivation to carry out chemical weapon attacks.
This includes
access to Libya's stockpile of chemical weapons and
a NATO-enabled pipeline feeding fighters, cash, and weapons from Libya
into Syria via NATO-member Turkey.

It was also confirmed that the US had been providing select terrorist units
operating in Syria, training in the handling of chemical weapons.
CNN had reported in December of 2012, in a
report titled, "Sources:
U.S. helping underwrite Syrian rebel training on securing chemical weapons,"
that:
The United States and some European allies
are using defense contractors to train Syrian rebels on how to secure
chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria, a senior U.S. official and several
senior diplomats told CNN Sunday.
The training, which is taking place in
Jordan and Turkey, involves how to monitor and secure stockpiles and
handle weapons sites and materials, according to the sources. Some of
the contractors are on the ground in Syria working with the rebels to
monitor some of the sites, according to one of the officials.
NATO not only ensured that chemical weapons in
Libya remained in the hands of a proxy regime now openly arming, aiding, and
sending fighters to assist terrorists in Syria, but also appears to have
ensured these terrorists possessed the know-how on handling and using these
weapons.
While absolutely nothing adds up across the West's corporate media networks,
one story that does add up is the claim by Syrian troops that terrorist
tunnels have been discovered containing chemical agents - as reported in
Reuters' article, "Syrian
soldiers enter rebel tunnels, find chemical agents: state TV."
What we are now witnessing is an attempt by the West's corporate-financier
establishment to push for direct intervention faster than the facts can come
out over what exactly happened near Damascus. Just as was the case in
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, the West hopes people can be made hysterical
enough, long enough, to get a "foot in the door," so the bombs can start
dropping.
Failing to do so at this juncture would spell the absolute end of
the West's current plans versus Syria and Iran - and so however tenuous and
discredited this latest plot may seem, expect dangerous desperation from the
West.
Now more than ever, Syria and its allies must be prepared to defend against
provocations both militarily and diplomatically.
