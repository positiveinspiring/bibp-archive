The Main Purpose of Cosmic Awareness at this Time
from
LightNetwork Website
This Awareness indicates it is all up to the
observer as to what is important to him. This Awareness indicates that the
purpose of this Awareness is to help entities become aware, to become aware of
those things that are happening in their realm of reality, in their world.
And in becoming aware, to become aware of what is happening to them, the purpose
of this Awareness is also to help them to better understand their own place in
the world of reality in which they reside, and what they themselves need to do
in order to be ready for what is the reality they witness.
This Awareness indicates that Its main message has been:
"Surrender self to Divinity! Give up the personal agendas to follow the Agenda of the Divine. All that is necessary is to give up self-importance and allow Divine Importance to take over"
If you find the reason for your life in a Divine Sense, then you have an agenda that serves the Divine Purpose. It is not necessarily your own personal agenda that you are following.
The Purpose of Following the Divine Agenda
This Awareness indicates that the personal agenda is generally one that
satisfies the flesh. The Divine Agenda generally is one that serves the needs of
many to whom you choose to obligate yourself and your energies to as an act of
devotion to the Divine.
Thus, you may serve many and serve them well. It may be an act of devotion to
God that motivates your service to others. This Awareness indicates in order for
you to serve others and serve them well it is important for you to know what is
happening in your reality, not to ignore it, not to go back to the bar to watch
last week's football game, but to know who you serve, why you serve them, and
why this is an act devoted to God.
This Awareness indicates that your first duties are to keep your own physical
well-being so that you can be of service and do not need service from others as
much as is possible, and in keeping yourself healthy.
To be able to serve others requires a certain amount of self-care, and from that
self-care, building yourself to the point where you can serve others; serve
those especially whom you are already obligated to; those whom you have chosen
to bring into the world; those whom you have accepted as part of your life, and
those into whom you have found yourself related to in such a way as to be part
of your lives, so that you serve those whom you are close to.
