# The EurozoneÂ’s Rescue Fund - German High Court Capitulates to Bankers

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalbanking267.htm

Originally it was scheduled to take effect July 1. Germanys parliament
was still debating it. Constitutional Court approval is required.
It could have linked passage to constitutional law change. Doing so
would have required Germanys first post-war national referendum. It
stopped short and approved what lacks legitimacy, and in the end wont
work.
On the one hand, countries are running out of resources. On the other,
the ECB has few bullets left. Everything it tried so far failed.
Constitutional approval changes nothing.
With it came conditions. The
Financial Times said those imposed appear less onerous than feared.
The Court ruled Germanys maximum 190 billion euro liability cant be
increased without its ESM representative approving it.
According to
Court President Andreas Vosskuhle:
(No) provision of this treaty may be interpreted in a way that
establishes higher payment obligations for the Federal Republic of
Germany without the agreement of the German representative.
It also insures Bundestag involvement. Under German law accompanying ESM
approval, the parliament must approve its representatives positions.
Its unclear if full parliamentary or budget committee voting is
required.
Another condition mandates that Bundestag and upper chamber Bundesrat
(representing federal states) are kept fully informed about bailout fund
activities.
Vosskuhle called the Court ruling provisional. Full proceedings will
follow. A final decision is expected in December. The Court plans a full
review of ESMs legality. At the same time, it said it wont accept ESM
interpretations to permit direct ECB borrowing.
Germany is the only Eurozone country that hasnt ratified the treaty
establishing ESM. Doing so is required to make it operative. Its likely
rubber stamp. Again does it matter?
Serious internal opposition exists. The group Mehr Demokratie (More
Democracy) sued the High Court to halt ratification.
It claims approval
entails,
unlimited and irreversible liability risks.
It wants a
referendum held to let Germans decide how their money will be spent.
Christian Social Union member Peter Gauweiler called accepting new
liabilities irresponsible. Members of Chancellor Angela Merkels
Christian Democrats are skeptical. Wolfgang Bosbach has mixed feelings,
he said.
Despite some advantages, hes greatly concerned about increasing
potential liability beyond whats safe and sensible.
In June, Germanys Bundestag approved ESM. President Joachim Gauck is
free to sign it. His signature is required.
ESM and EFSF will operate in parallel until mid-2013. At that time, ESM
will be on its own. Germany must provide 27% of its funds. Critics warn
amounts will end up much more than anticipated.
ESM will have 700 billion Euros in capital. Only 500 billion maximum can
be loaned. Troubled Spain and Italy need multiples that amount. Enough
resources arent available to provide it.
A push come to shove moment awaits. Its just a matter of time. It may
arrive sooner than expected. Economic conditions are dire and worsening.
Brussels-based Bruegel think tank deputy director Guntram Wolff believes ESM will only provide short-term relief. He doesnt think its enough.
How can it be with member state resources inadequate to fund it.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said todays ruling fell short. It doesnt
resolve crisis conditions. Its more feel good than real good. Whats
next remains a big unknown. Clarity may arrive with a bang or thud.
Once again, time alone was bought, little else. Nothing fundamental
changed. Perhaps fed up tax payers suffering austerity pain will have
final say. If not them, expect economic reality to rain on todays
parade. Severe problems remain unresolved.
On September 10,
Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden called banking slowdown
structural, not temporary.
The operating environment is unlikely to
change any time soon, he said.
Morgan Stanley calls the global economy a twilight zone of
uncertainty.
Graham Summers has been spot on in past analyses. He calls so-called
unlimited ECB bond buying Super Marios big bluff.
Market euphoria is based on his scheme and hope that ESM can work.
Marios plan replicates what he tried before that failed. Repackaging
failure under a new name wont turn out better than before. Its old
wine in new bottles gone rancid.
Conditionality is involved. Bailout help requires austerity. Imposing it
negates unlimited. Marios plan is more bluster than bite. Spain and
Italy reject it. Greece also balked. They want unconditional aid.
Its not automatic. Troubled nations must apply for it. EFSF funds will
be used. With around 65 billion Euros left, theyre severely depleted.
Spain and Italy are required to supply 30% of its resources.
How can they in effect bail themselves out? Draghi has good reason for
concern. Hes not sure what to do that works.
Neither does Bernanke. Hope springs eternal for QE III.
Expect Super
Mario bluff 2.0 instead. Bernankes running out of bullets. Rhetoric has
a short shelf life. It only reassures short-term.
St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said hes worried about central bankings future. His hoped for light at the end of the tunnel hasnt
arrived.
Summers says central bankers are fast losing their grip on things.
Theyll never admit publicly whats discussed privately. Theyre scared
stiff. Economic fundamentals are deteriorating. Consumer and business
confidence are down.
Revenue and profit growth are disappearing. Earnings revisions show
declines. Peak margins rolled over. Negative reads outnumber positive
ones. Momentum is heading south.
George Soros believes Germanys heading for Depression within six
months.
The policy of fiscal retrenchment in the midst of rising
unemployment is pro-cyclical and pushing Europe into a deeper and longer
depression, he said.
This is no longer a forecast. Its an observation. The German public
doesnt yet feel it and doesnt quite believe it. But it is all too real
in the periphery and it will reach Germany in the next six months or
so.
He added that Germany should develop a growth strategy, relax its
austerity insistence, or leave the Eurozone by an amicable
arrangement.
Current policies are pushing Europe into depression, he said. He expects
five to 10 tough years. Chinas heading for a hard landing. Doing so
will reinforce depression conditions. The Euro and EU are at risk.
Soros
spoke publicly on The Tragedy of the European Union.
Since 2000, America and other Western economies declined. Instead of
policies promoting growth and job creation, draconian austerity was
imposed.
Corporate interests are prioritized. Popular needs go unmet.
Economist
Jack Rasmus notes a growing corporatization of politics and government
in America. Democracy ends up the loser.
Most Americans dont understand how grievously theyve been harmed.
Imagine what may happen when they awaken.
Bad as things are now, expect
much worse ahead.
