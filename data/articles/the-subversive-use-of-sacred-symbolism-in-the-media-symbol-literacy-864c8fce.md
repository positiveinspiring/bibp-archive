If thou wilt know the invisible open
wide thine eyes on the visible
Kabalistic Adage
Humans are destined to rise to the level of
cosmic consciousness. Each of us is destined to actualize the level of the
Meta-Human.
This Ascent from the present embryonic state cannot,
however, be activated by will, desire, or any other conscious force, for it
comes as a necessary predicate to human organic existence and is
circumscribed by the inviolate laws of nature.
Its impulse lies seed-like
within the deepest strata of the Being.
We cannot force the lotus to grow
against its true nature, nor can we force the human consciousness to grow in
one specific direction, at one particular rate. Attempted intervention and
control of this kind results only in confusion, calamity and ruin.
If we find our natural organic development being stunted, impeded, or even
in a static state, it follows that there is a reason for the predicament.
Mans retrograde spiritual development is, in the mind of this author, not
occurring due to the lack of desire for attaining it, or because of Man's
failure to comprehend his ontology intellectually.
It is, in fact, due to
subtle impediments occluding its dynamic movement. Until these impediments
are removed, all the secondary incentives, strategies or preoccupations in
the world are not going to avail it.
During the sixties, for instance, the
prevailing mood among the sensitive was that western man was approaching the
denouement of his moral and spiritual evolution.
Drugs and drug-taking were,
at that time, even considered a means to this end. Yet, in spite of such
diversions into pseudo-shamanism, despite the good intentions, the healthy
mass rebellion, fine catch-phrases, and the do or die conviction of so
many intellectuals and counter-cultural pundits, mankind still finds itself
in a worse state, morally and spiritually, than it was just twenty or so
years ago.
Today, we find that the reactive excursion into the fields and
philosophy of technology may be for the most part, as predicted, yet another
escape, yet another dead-end. Technology as we see it today, for all its
utilitarian benefits, is hardly bringing people together, hardly fostering
social cohesion. Amongst the youth the digital revolution merely
reinforces estrangement and the masculine modes of expression and
cognition.
This does not mean that it has to go, for the technology behind
the internet, for instance, is a valuable "flaming sword" to be used by the
forces of "Light" in the meta-battle that is taking place on this planet and
whose end-game is definitely in sight.
Since the nineteenth century scientists have spent a great amount of time
and energy delving into the paleological and anthropological records,
questing after the origins of peoples and races. Many important discoveries
have been made. Ethnologists know something of the manner in which
forbearers lived and loved on a day-to-day basis, while biologists and
archaeologists can even tell us what they ate and wore.
However, little do
we still know about the thinking of the ancients. We know very little about
the way they communicated amongst themselves, and hoped to communicate to
others that they knew would be coming after. We know that the ancients did
have so much to communicate to their descendents. The testimony in stone, as
well as in painting, music, folklore, etc., is all there to see and inspire.
But the twentieth century is possibly the worst vantage point for looking
back into antiquity.
The intellectual vanity of our times distorts rather
than clarifies the vision of the past. We must not forget that the ancestors
were technologically advanced, and obviously considerably more-so than we
are today; for it took a sublime technology to construct the
Giza Pyramid
and to map the heavens.
Along with the technology of the ancients was the
reliance on, and understanding of, great metaphysical principles. In the
ancient world magic and science were never separate. The great megalithic
sites were designed and constructed by theologically advanced races, by
semi-enlightened priests and priestesses, not by rich technocrats and
atheistic scientists.
These great cyclopean treasures of marble, granite and
sandstone are temples and shrines to human beings who intuited no separation
between macrocosmic and microcosmic phenomena.
When it came to communication, we do know that the ancients were not so
interested in words and speech.
They were more concerned with symbols,
colors, rhythms, numbers, geometry and with dance and music. The greatest of
riches possessed by ancestral humankind was the ability to convey the most
abstract philosophical concepts via composite symbols. As this writer has
detailed elsewhere, no modern form of constructive intellection could even
have come into being without these bequeathments.
The success and skill of
the ancestors in figurative and iconic communication alone lays to rest the
idea that they were superstitious primitives. Now today it is unacceptable
that throughout western society, where all manner of symbols proliferate,
there is massive symbol illiteracy.
Everything else, it seems, is
prioritized. So, in light of this we do not feel redundant in asking how the
edifice of the personal intellect may be established and oriented correctly
when the very foundations are weak or misaligned?
If we do not own our own
thoughts we cannot own our own actions. It follows that someone else will.
This is the secret of propaganda. Those who are to be persuaded by it should
be completely immersed in the ideas of the propaganda, without ever noticing
that they are being immersed in it.
Joseph Goebbels (Nazi Minister of
Propaganda)
Children, as
tomorrows consumers
represent a huge market today and therefore are
fair game for corporations, says Lucy Hughes or, as another
advertising executive puts it, They arent children so much as what we
like to call evolving consumers".
- Joel Bakan (The Corporation)
Without inheriting and absorbing the gnosis of symbolism the individual
intellectual apparatus can never move toward the pretension of wisdom.
As J. Krishnamurti,
Carl Gustav Jung, Joseph Campbell and others have warned, it
is simply not possible.
And as Brian Wilson Keys, Vance Packard,
Jane Kilbourne and others have detailed, the psyche of entire generations can be
contaminated by the subversive use of symbols.
Some have asked why there are
no Beethovens or Blakes today.
The reason is obviously because we are
not, for the most part, involved in cultivating the kind of holistic mentation that brings the conscious mind into harmonious dialogue with the
other parts of Being. As Wilhelm Reich has pointed out we are not even
experiencing integration of the somatic level let alone the noetic. The
authority structures of the day are doing everything possible to make sure
that the psychic scission is augmented.
A look at the preoccupations and
mores of todays teen-culture is enough evidence of this tragedy, for those
with the eyes to see. Today, the youth consider it chic to dress from head
to foot in corporate logos with no idea what they really mean with most
parents having no clue as to why the delinquency and deterioration is
occurring.
Teen delinquency began as Madison Avenue publicists and
advertising agents gained control over the subconscious of the western
child, over the strata of awareness that has long ceased to be nurtured by
the sacred.
our children are growing up in a toxic cultural environment, one made more
toxic by advertising.
No one can escape it, just as no one can escape air
pollution or pesticides in our food
the world is fast becoming a global
marketplace controlled not by individual governments but by transnational
conglomerates interested only in profit.
As we Americans export our economic
system and our lifestyle, we also export the addictions, diseases, and
psychological problems associated with it - our hazardous cultural
environment
- Jean Kilbourne (Can't Buy My Love)
Thanks to our social and educational
institutions symbol, illiteracy has been
created and reinforced, for we repeat, it does not occur naturally and this
most dangerous development in our personal and collective evolution, the
lack of both telestic ritual and symbol literacy is met with by a
frightening indifference from those in the position to do something about
it.
We almost seem programmed to move from exclusively private aspirations
and it is, for the most part, unthinkable to us that the mediocre activities
and escapes of our lives can be laid completely aside in favor of the
revivification of the long lost symbol literacy that really bestows lucidity
and meaning to the biographical and collective or biological life.
This
incredible mediocrity of all we do, though cleverly disguised by the medias
barrage of fantasy and the millions of dollars that are thrown into pass√©
distractions, is the symptom of each person living in forgetfulness of their
own inner being.
Centuries of religion, philosophy, psychology and
psychoanalysis, of scientific and medical cures have done little to truly
enrich mankind. They have, for the most part, served only to maintain the
semblance of abnormality that passes for normality in societies that are
rapidly heading for their own cultural and perhaps even physical immolation.
As Alfred North Whitehead lamented:
The major advances in civilization are
processes that wreck the societies in which they occur.
If one values human life, one cannot value its destroyers
Ayn Rand
In individuals, insanity is rare, but in groups, parties, nations and epochs
it is the rule
Fredrick Nietzsche
We inhabit a Universe that no amount of scientific exploration is ever going
to fully comprehend.
This much has been scientifically and mathematically
proven. As the knowledge of left-hemisphere cognition increases so does the
amount of human ignorance. Mathematical equations have even been found which
delineate this. And need we add that the very means of gaining scientific
knowledge is often profoundly uneconomical and destructive.
The physical and
applied sciences that are meant to be, and pose as being, impartial and
objective are constantly found to be subservient to the control of power
monopolies, corporations and even secretive governmental think-tanks which
make sure that the research follows their often perfidious agendas. Luckily,
the metaphysical sciences and arts are, comparatively, not yet so
underwritten.
It is obvious that if we are really to apprehend the great
underlying truths, the metaphysical and occult sciences are the most
attractive means to do so. It is for this reason that the
New Age
movement, though retarded by its initial fallacies and fantasies, came into
being. Once it becomes proactive and disciplined, instead of reactive and
chaotic, as it is succeeding to become, discoveries of real importance to
all on the planet will be forthcoming and transmittable.
These truths will
be universal and not reserved to ones class or financial and intellectual
status.
Man seeks ever to increase his knowledge, but tends to overlook the fact
that his mind must forget as it learns. Knowledge comes to us, but it is a
knowledge gained through narrow left-brain cognitive abilities, though
exclusion, partiality and fragmentation, and not from seeing the world as it
actually is.
Dream is the closest most of us come to the reservoir of
ancestral knowledge and knowing, to that Akashic Record which lies within
the unconscious. and on a biologically cellular level.
When we finally
manage to
consciously utilize our Right-Brain capacities, we will, like the
ancients, be able to see reality as it is, and end the "subject versus
object" dichotomy, which holds us from a true and direct rapport with life.
As we do discover more and more about the way of the ancients, we also
understand how foolish it was to imagine that our present customs, religious
notions and ideals have anything in common with the ancients, the makers of
civilization. We are descended from them, but we have not emulated them, or
benefited from the wisdom they have left for us.
Their ideas of deity, and
of the mysteries of being and universe, would not find comparison in todays
Age of Entertainment, or as Gore Vidal terms it "The Age of Amnesia."
However, one thing that can still be gleaned and embraced from the days of
the high cultures is the symbolic, iconic dimension of expression, which
ultimately leads us individually and collectively back to psychic
integration. The western worlds collective psychic profile is patently
autistic and narcissistic, as any with the psychological background can see.
We are technologically advanced and spend much time congratulating ourselves
because of it.
Nowadays there is even talk of man created man as the
genetic sciences and approach become vogue. Science prides itself on its
incessant search for perfection, the implication being that man is not
already perfect.
However, the contrary is true. Man is perfect, just as he
is, until he becomes programmed to believe otherwise.
We cannot hear the
voice within that tells us of our own perfection due to the clamor of the
world which violates and numbs the senses, and which grows ever more
obnoxious and all-pervasive as time goes by.
We cannot see perfection in
anything or anyone while our own thoughts and intelligence is poisoned with
doubt and self-abnegation. We no longer recognize the utter perfection of
nature while we exist in a state of inner disorder.
The man riddled with
inner anxiety, jealousy and sadism is in no position to heal the world.
Advertising is designed to generate an inner sense of conflict with the self

Never before have so few been in a position to make fools, maniacs, or
criminals of so many
- Aldous Huxley (The Devils of Loudan)
As the numerology of the Tarot's Major Arcana reveals, the Twenty-First
Century is the time when the human race comes full circle.
And endings
invite new beginnings. In this new century the teachers will be those who
have understood the mystery of themselves, as well as the mysteries of
science and nature. They will be revealers rather than deceivers and
inner-directed individuals rather than controlled and repressed
role-players. They will be those who can provide healthy, functional
solutions to the problems that have beset their brothers and sisters
personally and collectively.
These solutions will be rooted in the wisdom of
the ancients and will afford us the ability to make those necessary quantum
leaps toward authenticity of life and performance. The Twenty-First Century
may also be a time when history, as we know and knew it, comes to an end.
Indeed, the world around us is changing faster than ever. Some even think
that time is "speeding up."
As existentialist psychiatrist R. D. Laing
wrote:
We live in a moment of history where change is so speeded up that we
begin to see the present only when it is already disappearing.
It is, lamentably, somewhat naive to expect the sciences to be governed by
Gnostic visionaries, rather than anti-human technocracies of power.
It is
also unwise to expect those still addicted to, and hungering for, power and
wealth to be concerned with the planet's overall welfare, or for psychotic
corporations to cater to the spiritual needs of the under-classes they seek
to enslave and dehumanize.
However, it is still a good policy to expect
positive changes ahead, especially on the grass-roots level, and to expect
man to discover within himself powers and abilities that have long been
dormant. Mankind can always be certain to surprise itself. In any case, the
door to social justice is always unlocked, and we all hold the key. The door
to self-realization is, likewise, always ajar, for all the heedless
passers-by.
Some willingly enter in from the chaotic and odorous
"market-place" of the world. Others become their own "Pharisees."
They fear
to enter themselves, and use all manner of guile to prevent others from
entering therein.
Man may cease in his insane desire to peer into the future when he
understands the magnitude of what he has already been given by his
forbearers, and when he fully and deeply grasps the vital importance of the
present moment in which he lives and breathes.
The man who understands the
sanctity and value of the NOW, wastes no time, not even a moment, worrying
about tomorrow's world, or the quest for "perfection." For the authentic
self, tomorrow does not exist, and Man is already perfect. The higher Guides
of such a man are continuously teaching and caring for his welfare. They
teach quietly by symbol and intimation, by dream and vision.
The man who
listens and heeds his numinous Guides, is instructed in the Art of Life, not
just the mechanics of it. His life becomes a living mandala of many petals
and colors, one that cannot be erased by time or death.
As the eagle crosses the empty sky without leaving a trace, so a man spans
eternity; on his strange spirallic journey of mind, body and soul moving as
one, through eternity, from perfection to perfection.
We shall not cease from exploration,
And the end of all our exploring,
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.

Due to chronic symbol illiteracy we tend to be
unaware of a great poison in our midst, something that has a profound
effect, negatively, on our conscious and unconscious selves.
This is the use
of subliminal persuasion in media and advertising.
This persuasion
constitutes nothing less than a psychic dictatorship.
It involves the
conscious subversive manipulation, and public purveyance, of words, images,
numbers, colors, rhythms and symbols which are then directed, via the
ubiquitous media oracles, toward the limbic areas of the human brain.
The
artifice of the Persuaders produces an elaborate and insidious cryptic
language specifically designed to stimulate fantasy versus reality
dichotomy, compulsive urges of the lower appetites, and a plethora of
mundane and dissonant drives which conflict with an individual's higher
conscious nature and intentions.
Constant exposure to such subliminal
content serves to undermine the healthy drives. It subverts the natural
moral sensibility and ultimately arrests human spiritual maturation.
The
devastating effects of such subversion on our selves, and on our children,
has rarely been explored to any great depth and has yet to be recognized by
the public at large who, being victims of chronic symbol illiteracy are
un-shielded against the constant barrage of subliminal information entering
their minds causing, over time, a nightmare list of physical and psychic
disorders.
There can be, in the mind of this author, no question of positive
social change, no question of either national or global healing until human
beings, particularly those in the western world, become lucidly cognizant
and profoundly educated concerning the power of symbols, not only as
transcendental portals, or mathematical devices, but as weapons in the hands
of plutocratic elites, with occult agendas, laboring to arrest the mental,
emotional, and spiritual maturation of the under-classes.
The alarming
existential chaos which the young presently endure, though mostly deplored
and ignored, serves as a direct indictment to the existence of the symbolic
subversion I mention.
The young are, by definition, closer to the creative
force than the average adult. They are also more influenced by the drives of
the limbic brain and, therefore, respond with greater zeal to the erotic and
even perverse symbolic messages which are becoming more and more pervasive
in their life- and think-space.
The invasive, clandestinely directed content
has been adroitly designed to bypass their moral conscience and rational
filter.
...research has shown that in the first few milliseconds of our perceiving
something we do not only unconsciously comprehend what it is, but decide
whether we like it or not; the cognitive unconscious" presents our awareness
with not just the identity of what we see, but an opinion about it. Our
emotions have a mind of their own, one which can hold views quite
independently of our rational mind
- Daniel Goleman (Emotional Intelligence)
It is a great source of error to believe that there is no perception in the
soul besides those of which it is conscious
Gotffried Wilhelm Leibniz
(1646-1716)
Childrens television and MTV, in fact, are the easiest places to launch
counterculture missiles. The more harmless or inane the forum, the more
unsuspecting the audience
Douglas Rushkoff (Media Virus)
Subliminal messages permeate television programs, computer games, magazines,
billboards, products and musical productions. They are, however, not limited
to the ambience of the young.
They are just one of the weapons in the
arsenal of soul-less, conscience-less, and
psychopathic corporations whose
entire modus operandi concerns profit and dehumanization.
All that is truly
aesthetic, traditional, cultural or substantial, merely stands in the way of
their monopolistic stratagems, their aggressive, relentless efforts at
reducing the entire human race to a body of narcissistic, sense-infatuated,
desensitized, amoral, immoral or actively criminal "happy depressives"
wielding credit cards.
I think we are destroying the minds of America and that has been one of my
lifelong ambitions

The language of business is not a language of the soul or the language of
humanity. Its a language of indifference, its a language of separation,
secrecy and hierarchy
Anita Rodderick (creator of the Body Shop)
the corporation remains as it was at the time of its origins, as a mad
business institution in the middle of the nineteenth century, and legally
designated person designed to valorize self interest and invalidate moral
concern. Most people would find its personality abnormal, even
psychopathic, in a human being, yet curiously we accept it in societys most
powerful institutions
- Joel Bakan (The Corporation)
Business is business we say; people are merely selling their products. If
only this were true.
A little research and objective observation tells a
different tale. The elite of the advertising agencies are extraordinarily
educated and intuitive people usually from private schools or hired by
prestigious think-tanks. Though it may come as news to the consumer, it is a
fact that selling products is only an ostensible concern to them.
Though it
may sound rather bizarre, it is their job to implant political and
aesthetically conditioning motifs within the brains of their erstwhile
viewers.
These implanted messages are, more often than not, against the
interests of the conscious volition. It is therefore an actual crime to put
them out. Their ability do this successfully arises from the fact that the
advertisers are fully conversant with the intricacies of human and social
psychology, the operations of the mind and the autonomic motor skills.
They
study the complex nature of desire, emotion, libido and appetite and many of
their researches take them into occult fields, into the realm of sabeanism
and magick where talismans, amulets, symbols, mudras, mantras and rhythms
are frequently used for healing and apotropaic means.
Some of the most talented and creative people in the world are dedicated
this work, indeed, the most skillful propagandists of our time are not
working for dictators, they are certainly not working exclusively for the
Democratic party or the Republican either.
They are working for Foote, Cone
& Belding, Ogilvy & Mather, and DDB Needham Worldwide
- Jane Kilbourne
(Can't Buy My Love)
Down through the centuries symbols are memorized and become part of the
collective phylogenetic reservoir.
They are in our "Race Memory." When such
symbols are used they invariably stimulate reactions, often emotive and
sexual. Some were and still are specifically designed to affect the limbic
centers of the brain. In primitive cultures we hear of the Voodoo doctor and
his attendant zombie.
The latter was an ordinary live, thinking person, who
was slowly and surreptitiously administered the juice of the Datura plant,
which drugged his senses and consciousness into a state of listlessness and
passivity. Each day, lest he revive, the zombie had to ingest more of the
potion. Today, we see the same process at work, only with greater frequency
and over a larger demographic.
In our case, the "Datura" is not organic, but
auditory, visual and digital. We have ivory-tower witchdoctors and
cyber-space sorcerers.
Their particular concoction of spells are cast via
techniques that go by names such as:
New techniques, yes, but with the same deadly
effect as any past voodoo, sorcery or telepathy.
Recently, a professional
hypnotist declared that the very same skills used to lull the mind into a
state of suggestibility are unquestionably used by advertising agents.
We must all face the fact that our leaders are certifiably insane or worse
William S. Burroughs
You don't understand
It's not about money...It's about power and influence
-
Michael Ovitz (interview with Mike Rosenfield)
Yes, it appears that the magicians and wizards, the "enchanters" of the
story books, are still alive and well and very busy.
Advertisers are the
Leonardos and Michaelangelos of today and are still very much under
oligarchic patronage. They are, however, not utilizing their prodigious
endowments for the spiritual or cultural uplift of mankind. They are master
persuaders and deal in behavioral and motivational sciences. Their modus operandi is the systematic erosion of the moral, intellectual and spiritual
architecture of society.
Cannot the spiritual vacuity and moral degradation
of our century be traced to the corruption peddled by these Apollonian
persuaders in their gleaming corporate penthouses?
A century and a half after its birth, the modern business corporation, and
artificial person made in the image of a human psychopath, now is seeking to
remake real people in its image.

No one's really worrying about what it's (advertising to children) teaching
impressionable youth. Hey, I'm in the business of convincing people to buy
things they don't need

We readily accept that most other species can be trained and their behavior
altered.
This occurs either by direct manipulation and "training," or by the
circumferential change to a creatures environment and habitat beyond its
conscious awareness. And though its sounds controversial, the situation is
no different with the human race.
The injustices and criminality that
proliferates at every corner of the planet is proof enough as to the success
of the Pavlovian artifices here described.
In the cybernetic age, the individual becomes increasingly subject to
manipulation.
His work, his consumption, and his leisure are manipulated by
advertising, by ideologies, by what Skinner calls positive reinforcements.
The individuals loses his active, responsible role in the social process; he
becomes completely adjusted and learns that any behavior, act, thought, or
feeling which does not fit into the general scheme puts him at a severe
disadvantage; in fact he is what he is supposed to be
What has happened in
modern industrial society is that traditions, and common values, and genuine
social personal ties with others have largely disappeared. The modern mass
man is isolated and lonely, even though he is part of a crowd; he has no
convictions which he could share with others, only slogans and ideologies he
gets from the communications media
- Erich Fromm (Anatomy of Human
Destructiveness)
The world consists of imaginary people, claiming imaginary virtues and
suffering from imaginary happiness
- Vernon Howard
Without personal study or experience one will balk at these facts.
The
controlling oligarchs have made real sure that little information regarding
this subject has reached the mass public. Though there is an unbelievable
barrage of advertising symbols in our world, and though it is known that
billions of dollars are involved in their production, distribution and
monitoring, the public has little cognizance of the impact that they are
having on the inner and outer life.
Walking around decorated with the logos
and brand names of capitalistic conglomerates is considered normal and even
chic today.
Though thousands of classical creations of music and art are
debauched daily under their hand, and though our visual space is cluttered
with ad-copy and billboards, few in authority raise a murmur against it. In
professional circles the pyramidical structure of profiteering, monolithic
corporations prevents those in even close association with the advertising
business from seeing its inner workings.
The man who does not know what it means to be under psychic hypnosis, is
probably already under it
- Vernon Howard
In fact, the only way to really comprehend the complete ramifications of
their work is to familiarize ourselves with spiritual symbolism and even
with the subjects of Tarot, Alchemy and Astro-Theology, etc,.
It is only
through studying the nature of consciousness and its intimate relationship
with color, symbol, number and word that we can take back the power we are,
unconsciously, placing in their hands. As the cultural critics have
asserted, there are few more physical frontiers to for man to conquer. It
has been noticed that there is, however, unlimited room for expansion and
expression in cyber-space, on the information highway in what is called
the data-space.
There, symbolic motifs of all modalities can proliferate
and literally infest our minds. The danger here is that these images and
their frequency come into minds that are almost entirely illiterate in
regards the meaning of symbols. There are 250,000 miles of neural threads in
the brain, enough to stretch from earth to the moon, and on each micro-meter
of these threads there are over 240,000 bits of information.
This data is,
however, not in words but in pictograms, composite images. There are 37
sensory inputs to the brain and not just the five we have been told about.
The image merchants know how to communicate to the deeper strata of the
mind.
And in order to discover how put the spell on us, we need to develop a
new kind of literacy, and new correlative meta-sight, which transcends the
linear, left brain modes of comprehension and analysis.
The man who understands a symbol not only opens himself to the objective
world but at the same time succeeds in emerging from his personal situation
and reaching a comprehension of the universal... thanks to the symbol, the
individual experience is "awoken" and transmuted into a spiritual act
- Mircea Eliade
Symbols have been used by all major cultures and, naturally, there could be
no true advance to higher forms of language and communication without them.
Symbols are higher forms of communication. However, within the greater
"book," so to speak, of Symbolism, there exists a master-chapter - that of
the Tarot. The Tarot, with its rich and enigmatic imagery, constitutes the
key chapter in the great book of Symbolism.
I have personally found that
the esoteric study of the Tarot, and its sister arts of Astrology, Kabala
and Numerology, greatly assists us to awaken our innate intelligence (Wisdom
Body). Through these great arcane arts we succeed in cultivating true
"Symbolic Literacy" and the capacity for "Pattern-Recognition."
These Arts
allow us to shift the intellect, imagination, and attention into a
synergetic and polyphrenic mode, where the reason and critical apparatus
operate consistently at a high amplitude, and in which the psyche is
protected from the incoming "viral" messages damaging to its equilibrium and
core nature.
Through them we gain access our inner spiritual "Guides" who
have all our answers, thus freeing us from chronic dependency on other
people who are, themselves, likewise condemned to rely on the hit-or-miss
"advice" of others around them.
Working correctly and responsibly with these
high Arts serves to liberate the higher will within us and makes it easier
for us to detach from unhealthy fears and longings. Having our higher Self
as friend and counselor dramatically alters the "ignorance versus knowledge"
and "failure versus success" dichotomies in our favor, and allows us to
perceive, and heal, the compulsions that chain us to our respective
socially-vetted roles.
Eventually, we are not only able to release ourselves
from our dysfunctional relationships with other people, but also from those
lower-emotional and mental labyrinths that so frequently entrap us inwardly.
Through these Arts we assume command over our own destinies and can end the
habituation and mediocrity which, unfortunately, has defined the lives of
the great mass of urban humanity, since the Industrial Revolution.
...perhaps there is a pattern set up in the heavens for one who desires to
see it, and having seen it, to find one in himself
- Plato
The return to sanity, both personally and socially, has been a major theme
of innumerable psychologists, activists and philosophers for decades.
The
men and women of reason have concluded that something is very wrong,
existentially, with post-Industrial humanity. Experts have gone to great
lengths to describe what is wrong with the way urban man lives.
However,
they offer precious little of substance when it comes to coherent solutions
to mankinds vexatious problems. We are now in the twenty-first century and
the time for "problem-think" is, in the mind of this writer, over. It is now
time for "solution-think;" for mankind to proactively face reality in order
to change it, and to have zero-tolerance for all the factors which enslave
the psyche or the body.
This paradigm-shift involves the acceptance and
confrontation of the "dark sides" of the human ego-personality, and a desire
to see ourselves in totality, for who we are morally and psychologically. It
is our habitual avoidance and denial that have brought the world, and
humanity, to the brink of ecocide and psychosis.
The ego reigns, but the ego
is nothing less than the ghost which has arisen from the grave of the Self.
The shift also means a return to the wisdom of our ancient forbearers who
did things right the first time, and who lived in harmony with the elements
and with the flora and fauna.
The high Arts of Divination are their solemn
and beauteous bequest to us, and a gift that we need to respect and ardently
employ in every aspect of our lives. The Divination Arts contain the mystery
of the great rites of passage, and of how a man may make the crossing from
the horizontal plane of ego-life, to the vertical one of self-hood.
They
contain the secrets of how we transcend Karmic existence and become one with
our Dharma (life purpose). Within these Arts we find the archetypal and
numinous symbols of Individuation which, like a golden key, serve to unlock
the gates of wisdom and salvation.
As this gate opens toward freedom and
empowerment, the vile door to the world's calamity and debauch is closed and
locked forever.
True sanity entails, in one way or another, the dissolution of the normal
ego, that false self competently adjusted to our alienated social reality:
the emergence of the inner archetypal mediators of divine power, and
through the death a rebirth, and the eventual re-establishment of a new kind
of ego-functioning, the ego now being the servant of the divine, no longer
its betrayer
R. D. Laing (The Politics of Experience)
the prevalent sensation of oneself as a separate ego enclosed I a bag of
skin is a hallucination which accords neither with Western science nor with
the experimental philosophy-religions of the East
This hallucination
underlies the misuse of technology for the violent subjugation of mans
natural environment and, consequently, its eventual destruction
- Alan Watts
(The Book: On the Taboo of Knowing Who You Are)
Central to our healing and empowerment is the awakening of a socially astute
hermeneutic regarding the subversive use of symbols and the complete,
detailed exposure of the subtle means of persuasion employed by those
shadowy oligarchs and technocrats who have always believed us incapable of
taking responsibility for our own intelligence, our own mental and spiritual
evolution.
Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Plato emphatically
warned his society of the consequences to evolution and truth if the
artists were unrestricted in their influence of the consciousness of
mankind (see
The Republic). I believe that he was aware of the existence, even
then, of the subversive elements which seek to manipulate thought through
that which appears innocent and harmless.
In 1835, the French historian
Alexis de Tocqueville, phrased the same concern in this interesting manner:
I fear that the productions of democratic poets may often be surcharged with
immense and incoherent imagery, with exaggerated descriptions and strange
creations; and that the fantastic beings of their brain may sometimes make
us regret the world of reality.
However explicit, the cogent warnings of Plato, Aristotle, Leibniz,
Jean Baudrillard, and others, have largely gone unheard. Nor should we need the
great philosophers to tell us that are symbolically literate personages
operating in the world adroitly employing their "art" for the pernicious
purposes of control and suppression.
Theirs is a legacy of what may be
called "black magic" practices designed to adversely condition behavior,
control thought and engender all that is sordid and grotesque in the human
psyche. Through their malignant manipulation of words, numbers, colors,
images, rhythms, sounds, and light, great injustices infest the world.
The
ancients would not easily have believed their descendants capable of such
sacrilege. In historical times, symbols were employed to inspire and to
illustrate the subtlest and loftiest of mysteries, and give expression to
man's deepest philosophical realizations.
Among the ancients, who dealt largely with psychical sciences, there seems
to have been a common language which could be used to explain the invisible
world and its inhabitants; but we of this age have not yet developed such a
language.
Consequently, men who deny human immortality, as well as men with
religious faith who have not
transformed that faith into a fact, nowadays
in
attempting to explain psychic fact, call it mysticism
W. Y. Evans Wentz
(Fairy Folklore in Celtic Countries).
The Egyptians, either by exact science or spontaneously, had arrived at a
method by means of which they could rite with distinct picture of material
objects, instead of ordinary letters expressing sounds and phrases.
These
pictures were not ordinary images of the things they represented but were
endowed with certain symbolic qualities (Sophia), by means of which they
revealed to the initiated contemplator a profound insight into the very
essence of substances of things, and an intuitive understanding of their
transcendental origins, an insight which was not the result of reasoning or
mental reflection, but was acquired spontaneously by means of divine
inspiration and illumination.
As artistic representations of this phenomenal
world, they revealed, in fact, the ideal world of the soul
Plotinus
numbers are not concepts consciously invented by men for purposes of
calculation. They are spontaneous and autonomous products of the unconscious
- as are other archetypal symbols
- Carl Gustav Jung (Man and His Symbols)
Cynics who continue to doubt whether symbols and
images have any lasting
negative affect on consciousness had better remember and study the most
recent example of mass control through the use of occult manipulation and
symbolic suggestion: Nazi Germany.
The Nazis openly used ritual
choreography, ancient symbols and rallying chants, powerful mystical logos
and regalia, etc., to facilitate their designs and give them control over an
entire people.
It is known that Hitler and Himmler had close ties with
occultists and astrologers and took precautions to wipe out those who would
threaten their schemes. Evangelists and other members of the religious elite
are also expert in mass-suggestion.
As financier J.P. Morgan said:
Millionaires don't use astrology... The billionaires do!
The news-anchors are
forever subtly emphasizing stereotypes, dichotomy and dialectical divisions.
Sports also provide one of the most adroit ways of creating and reinforcing
not only competition mania, but endless allegiances based on dialectical
divisions.
Dialectics are found throughout the business, political and
entertainment worlds:
Levis versus Jordac, Coke versus Pepsi, ABC versus
CNN. Stones versus Beatles, Rockers versus Mods. Letterman versus Leno,
Russia versus USA, Republican versus Democrat, Conservative versus Liberal,
Catholic versus Protestant, Atheist versus Believer, Gay versus Straight,
Black versus White, Arab versus Jew, Rich versus Poor and even Male versus
Female, etc...
There can be no doubt that, in general, dialectics are a necessary part of
human evolution.
It is when the dialectical art becomes a weapon in the
hands of those trying to lead humankind to moral and psychological
perdition, that society has the obligation to take resolute action.
The
danger arises when a powerful philosophical premise is applied to social
problems in the same cold, unfeeling and pragmatic manner as a binary
calculation is used to solve some mathematical conundrum.
Such egregious
manipulation is injurious existentially and socially precisely because it is
so pervasive and because the injury is often proportional to the natural
innocence and impressionability of the victims. Subliminal content enters
the personal or collective psyche against the conscious volition and at the
cost of that which is qualitatively superior.
It is the proverbial enemy
within.
Advertising is designed to generate an inner sense of conflict with the self
Bernard McGrave PhD
Throughout the ages it has been considered normal, and even exemplary,
behavior to die for a flag.
We still assault others over a sport or
political allegiance, feel superior due to the clothes, home or car that we
possess. Ours is a time obsessed with comparison and prestige,
over-achievement and of the projection of fantasy into reality.
It does not
matter a jot whether nature, animals, children, the elderly, the invalid or
other nations and indigenous peoples suffer. I have traced many levels of
psychosis and multiple personality dementia, as well as teen and adult
dysfunction and sexual criminality to the effects, through the years, of
advertising. Now there is even talk of genetic technology that allows man to
make man.
We certainly excel at the artifice and technology, but seem
incapable of allowing existing men to live in freedom, or even to be happy.
The ancient Romans built their greatest masterpieces of architecture, for
wild beasts to fight in.

America has the most of everything, and the best of nothing.
- John Keats
And no man can be happy when his thoughts and behavior are being
subliminally manipulated by a decadent technocratic elite bent on
programming him as if it were a mere machine.
Their creation is not a happy
or free man inhabiting a secure Utopia. He is the addicted victim suffering
psychic and emotional impotency and enmeshed in guilt and conflict as a
result of it. His inner life is a miasma of unfulfilled desires and misplaced
allegiances. He is under the "Hex."
Once the connection and rapport with the
inner self is occluded, we become slaves of external approval and security.
Consequently, those who command our adoration must be like ourselves, or be
those who appear to possess a greater abundance of those chimeras which we
believe to be of value. Western man has replaced life with lifestyle, and
continues to award himself, and those he gives birth to, for knowing, as
speedily and vacantly as possible, everything there is to know about
everyone and everything else in the world, other than the Self.
He sees but
rarely observes. He thinks, but rarely with his own mind, and rarely about
his own moral and psychological welfare.
He fights and dies for the
preservation and sovereignty of friends, family, countries, states and
ideals, but is estranged from himself, and bereft of personal psychic
sovereignty and emotional immunity.
The twenty-first century will be the era of the World Controllers
The older
dictators fell because they could never supply their subjects with enough
bread, enough circuses, enough miracles, and mysteries.
Under a scientific
dictatorship, education will really work
most men and women will grow up to
love their servitude and will never dream of revolution.
There seems to be
no good reason why a thoroughly scientific dictatorship should ever be
overthrown
- Aldous Huxley (Brave New World
Revisited)
Tragically, that which man consumes also consumes him. Sickened and
desperate in his own soul, and knowing next to nothing about his own
essence, he charges back and forth vainly, with a thousand and one ideas and
plans, administering to the maladies of his equally debilitated neighbors
and fellow humans.
His mind is plagued with "media viruses" and his libido
rages within from all kinds of toxic embedded programming.
By divorcing
ourselves from our center, and in losing our once natural sense of interior
life, we become a generation of those who must have but cannot be, who know
what but not how to think. Persona-drives and limbic-drives predominate, and
compel man to live at the periphery of Being, on the surface of himself. He
does not own his own thoughts, and yet believes himself capable of
"independent" thought and choice.
True, thought can be creative, but
thoughts can also be created, and distorted, by agencies that seek to
enslave the very soul, and confound the natural intelligence of man.
Pestilence and injustice ride their steeds through our world, but go unseen,
sowing the seeds of doom among the innocent and pure, within those hearts
and minds as yet unprotected by knowledge and awareness.
When told that man lives in delusion everyone thinks of himself as the
exception - hence his delusion
- Vernon Howard
Emile Durkheim called this phenomenon anomie and found that it was the
main cause of suicide which had been increasing with the growth of
industrialization. He referred by anomie to the destruction of all
traditional social bonds, due to the fact that all truly collective
organization had become secondary to the state and that all genuine social
life had been annihilated.
He believed that people living in the modern
political state are a disorganized dust of individuals
- Erich Fromm
(Anatomy of Human Destructiveness)
The subversive forces that operate as described and who deal so
contemptuously with the "under-classes" they inwardly fear, can be
sanctioned, penalized and even overthrown once we return to the "Symbol
Literacy" natural to our ancient forbearers.
When the "inner eye" is opened
and "Pattern Recognition" becomes as natural to us as breathing, the tables
will be turned on the subversive malefactors of Madison Avenue and similar
corporate tyrannies.
After we develop even a rudimentary critical
intelligence, it will be then that Truth will decide to once more return and
dwell among us. Our indifference and neglect has banished both Truth and
Virtue to the voids.
To welcome them back into the human circle and to be
nourished again by their company, we must first adopt a zero-tolerance
attitude toward any living, or corporate, entity whose agendas and artifice
flies in the face of reason, which contributes to the rape of the earth, and
which profits from the humiliation and impoverishment of all sentient and
non-sentient life-forms.
