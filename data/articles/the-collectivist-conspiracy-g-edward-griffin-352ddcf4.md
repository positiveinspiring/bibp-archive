In this exclusive 80 minute video interview, legendary conspiracy
author G. Edward Griffin explains how his research, which spans no
less than 5 decades, has revealed a banking elite obsessed with enforcing a
world government under a collectivist model that will crush individualism
and eventually institute martial law as a response to the inevitable
backlash that will be generated as a result of a fundamental re-shaping of
society.
Griffin discusses the similarities between the extreme left and the extreme
right in the false political paradigm and how this highlights a recurring
theme - collectivism.
Collectivism is the opposite of individualism
and believes that the interests of the individual must be sacrificed for the
greater good of the greater number, explains Griffin, uniting the doctrines
of communism and fascism.
Both the Republican and Democrat parties in the
United States are committed to advancing collectivism and this is why the
same policies are followed no matter who is voted in to the White House.
"All collectivist systems eventually
deteriorate into a police state because that's the only way you can hold
it together," warns Griffin.

how the elite maintained a silent dictatorship while fooling people into
thinking they had political freedom, by creating squabbles between the two
parties in terms of slogans and leadership, while all the time controlling
both from the top down and pursuing the same agenda.

grass roots movement, was later hijacked by the Republicans through the
likes of Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck.
