Certain Cities

I would
remind you that we are in a period of shifting rays and that they change both for
individuals and nations, for hemispheres and planets. All can move off a minor ray on to a
major, if destiny decrees. A study of the above tabulation will give much light to the
inter-human relation. Three great countries hold the destiny of humanity in their hands at
this time: The United States of America, Great Britain and Russia. Great fusing, racial
experiments are going on in all these lands; the rule of the people is being developed in
all of them, though it is as yet in an embryonic stage. In Russia it is being retarded by
a dictatorship which will shortly end; in the States by corrupt politics, and in Great
Britain by ancient imperialistic tendencies. But democratic principles are being
developed, if not controlling; religious unity is being established though it is not yet
functioning, and all three countries are learning very rapidly, though the United States
at present is learning the most slowly.
The Occident and the Orient are linked through the personality ray of the Occident and
the soul ray of the Orient; this indicates eventual understanding, once the second ray
occidental soul becomes the dominant factor. When these various relationships are somewhat
grasped by the peoples of the world, you will get the clue to the various happenings
taking place today and will understand the goal and the method of its attainment more
clearly. There is much deep research work to be done, for the science of energy
relationships is yet in its infancy.
The next few years will see its gain. What is really happening is a shift in the human
consciousness from its focus on individual energies functioning through some specific
ring-pass-not (individual, national, continental or racial) to a grasp of their
interrelation and effects upon each other. This science can be studied in various ways:
[102]
Therefore,
through the five major centers in the planet today, spiritual energy is streaming forth,
and according to the vehicle of expression which receives its impact so will be the
reaction and activity, and so will be the type of consciousness interpreting and using it.
The ancient occult truism remains accurate: "Consciousness is dependent upon its
vehicle for expression and both are dependent upon life and energy for existence."
This remains an immutable law. The five cities which are the exoteric expression of the
esoteric center of force and through which the Hierarchy and Shamballa are seeking to work
are the correspondence in the planetary body to the four centers up the spine and the ajna
center in the body of humanity and of individual man. In all three cases, they are
"living vital focal points of dynamic force" to a greater or less extent. Some
predominantly express soul energy and some personality force; some are influenced by
Shamballa and some by the Hierarchy. The head center of the Occident is beginning to react
to second ray energy and the ajna center to fourth ray energy and in this lies the hope of
the race of men. [103]
