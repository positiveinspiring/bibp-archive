Theres so much data available on the internet
that even government cyberspies need a little help now and then to sift
through it all.
So to assist them, the National Security Agency produced a
book to help its spies uncover intelligence hiding on the web.
The 643-page tome, called
Untangling The Web - A Guide to Internet Research
(large pdf file), was just
released by the NSA following a FOIA request filed in April by
MuckRock, a
site that charges fees to process public records for activists and others.
The book was published by the Center for Digital
Content of the National Security Agency, and is filled with advice for using
search engines, the Internet Archive and other online tools. But the most
interesting is the chapter titled Google Hacking.
Say youre a cyberspy for the NSA and you want
sensitive inside information on companies in South Africa. What do you do?
Search for confidential Excel spreadsheets the
company inadvertently posted online by typing filetype:xls site:za
confidential into Google, the book notes.
Want to find spreadsheets full of passwords in
Russia? Type filetype:xls site:ru login. Even on websites written in
non-English languages the terms login, userid, and password are
generally written in English, the authors helpfully point out.
Misconfigured web servers,
that list the contents of directories not
intended to be on the web often offer a rich load of information to
Google hackers, the authors write, then offer a command to exploit
these vulnerabilities - intitle: index of site:kr password.
Nothing I am going to describe to you is
illegal, nor does it in any way involve accessing unauthorized data,
the authors assert in their book. Instead it involves using publicly
available search engines to access publicly available information that
almost certainly was not intended for public distribution.
You know, sort of like the hacking
for which Andrew weev Aurenheimer was recently sentenced to 3.5 years in
prison for obtaining publicly accessible information from AT&Ts
website.
Stealing intelligence on the internet that
others dont want you to have might not be illegal, but it does come with
other risks, the authors note: It is critical that you handle all Microsoft
file types on the internet with extreme care. Never open a Microsoft file
type on the internet. Instead, use one of the techniques described here,
they write in a footnote.
The word here is hyperlinked, but since the
document is a PDF the link is inaccessible. No word about the dangers that
Adobe PDFs pose. But the version of the manual the NSA released was last
updated in 2007, so lets hope later versions cover it.
Although the authors name is redacted in the
version released by the NSA, Muckrocks FOIA indicates it was written by
Robyn Winder and Charlie Speight. A note the NSA added to the book before
releasing it under FOIA says that the opinions expressed in it are the
authors, and not the agencys.
Lest you think that none of this is new, that
Johnny Long has been talking about this for years at hacker conferences and
in his book
Google Hacking, youd be right.
In fact, the authors of the NSA book give a
shoutout to Johnny, but with the caveat that Johnnys tips are designed for
cracking - breaking into websites and servers.
That is not something I encourage or
advocate, the author writes.
