Italy's 10 year bond yields rose above 7% on
Wednesday (November 9, 2011) and economists from around the world are
now proclaiming that these interest rates are unsustainable with Italy's
national debt now 120% of its GDP.
NIA (National Inflation Association)
believes the ECB is currently working on their largest bailout in history
where they will commit to purchasing over 1 trillion of Italian bonds and
bonds of other Eurozone countries that are at risk of becoming insolvent.
Despite the signals currently being given by the
ECB, they will not allow Italy to fail because it will cause a Great
Depression throughout the European Union, which will lead to the destruction
of the Eurozone.
Economists today fail to realize that 10 year bond yields of 7% are normal
for not just Italy, but the rest of the Eurozone and the United States.
If it wasn't for
the ECB holding their benchmark interest
rate at artificially low levels for over a decade, Italy and other Eurozone
countries wouldn't have the high levels of debt they do today and they would
be able to withstand yields of 7% or higher. The ECB is entirely at fault
for the European Debt Crisis and they are about to follow in the footsteps
of the Federal Reserve by abandoning their objective of maintaining price
stability and keeping inflation low.
German 10 year bond yields declined again today to 1.72% and the spread
between Germany and Italy is at a new record of 553 basis points.
Germany is benefiting from safe haven buying
from investors selling Italian bonds and buying German bonds, but investors
will soon realize that German bonds are no better than Italian bonds and the
world will dump all Euro denominated bonds.
Bond investors currently expect very little inflation in the Eurozone, as
seen by Germany's low bond yields. The sole reason for the large spread
between German and Italian bonds is Italy's greater risk of default.
However, a default by Italy would lead to the failure of Germany's largest
banks. Germany knows this but they don't want to raise inflation
expectations by making the world think that the ECB will be monetizing
Italy's debt.
Therefore, Germany is now telling Italy to
request aid from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)
if needed. Unfortunately, the EFSF doesn't have the financial resources to
rescue a country the size of Italy.
Last week, the EFSF had to cancel a 3 billion
auction of 10 year bonds due to a lack of investor interest. On Monday, the
EFSF finally had the bond sale, but was met with subdued interest that
barely covered the 3 billion in bonds being offered. So far the EFSF has
only raised a total of 13 billion through bond sales, but has received 440
billion in guarantees from Eurozone countries.
If Italy becomes a recipient of EFSF funding,
the EFSF will lose one of their largest contributors.
The EFSF is looking to leverage up its 440 billion in funding to over 1
trillion. The European Debt Crisis was caused by too much leverage
and debt. It is complete insanity to believe that the EFSF is going to solve
the debt crisis when it too is getting deeply into debt and planning to use
huge leverage to increase their funds available for bailouts.
There was recently a report that a proposal was made at the G20 summit last
week in Cannes for Germany and other leading countries in the Eurozone to
pool together their foreign currency reserves including their gold reserves
to back the EFSF, which would allow it to easily leverage up their funds and
raise more money through bond sales.
As soon as this report surfaced, Germany
immediately announced to the world that they will not be using their gold
reserves to boost the EFSF and that their gold reserves are "untouchable".
Germany's unwillingness to use their gold reserves clearly shows that
gold is the real safe haven where individuals should store their
savings if they want to keep their purchasing power.
Investors buying German 10 year bonds with a
yield of only 1.72% should ask themselves why Germany is willing to fund the
EFSF with Euros but not their gold. Maybe investors will come to their
senses and change their mind about buying any Euro denominated bonds.
For the past decade there has been a bond bubble in both Europe and the U.S.
where we have seen bond yields at artificially low levels for an
unprecedented amount of time. This has caused modern economists to believe
that low bond yields are the new normal.
When central banks interfere in the free market
by manipulating interest rates to artificially low levels, it creates
asset bubbles that eventually burst. When asset bubbles burst, the free
market takes over and attempts to correct the damage by raising interest
rates to extremely high levels, which encourages consumers to reduce their
consumption and increase their savings.
NIA believes that over the next five years, 10 year bond yields will reach
double digit territory throughout the Eurozone and the U.S. The free market
wants countries like Greece and Italy to default on their debts and
restructure them, which is why their bond yields are rising so high.
Although Greece and Italy have the highest debt levels in the Eurozone as a
percentage of GDP, the whole entire Eurozone borrowed too much and has too
much debt.
Germany and France both know that the failure of
Italy will spread to them when German and French banks with Italian debt
begin to fail.
The EFSF will soon be exposed as a failure
itself when it is unable to attract the funding necessary to rescue Eurozone
countries in need of bailouts. Unless the ECB decides to bailout Eurozone
countries through the EFSF by buying their bonds, the ECB will be forced to
directly monetize debts across the entire Eurozone.
Even though the destruction of the Eurozone seems imminent, NIA believes it
will take time to play out. Most likely, in about two or three months from
now the media will begin focusing its attention on the U.S. crisis. When the
spotlight is off Italy, their bond yields will temporarily dip back down,
but U.S. bond yields will skyrocket.
The U.S. national debt is very close to breaking
100% of GDP, which will likely be a catalyst for investors to begin dumping
their U.S. dollar denominated assets. The U.S. has unfunded liabilities many
times the size of Italy's unfunded liabilities. Including unfunded
liabilities, while Italy's total debts are approximately 300% of their GDP,
the U.S. has total debts equaling about 600% of its GDP.
Austerity cuts are becoming very common in the Eurozone and although
citizens still protest them, it has become politically acceptable for
politicians in Italy and other Eurozone countries to support them.
Italy's cash budget deficit as a percentage of
GDP is currently only 3.9% and their national debt has been barely growing.
The U.S. cash budget deficit as a percentage of GDP is currently 8.7%, more
than double Italy, and the U.S. national debt has been growing at a record
rate. Americans are used to stimulus over austerity. Members of Congress are
too afraid to make necessary spending cuts.
The U.S. has a budget deficit from entitlement
programs and interest payments on the debt alone. The supercommittee created
by Congress to recommend $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions by November 23rd,
so far hasn't agreed to make reductions to any entitlement programs.
The Democrats and Republicans have so far only
reached consensus on changing the way the government calculates inflation
for Social Security cost of living adjustment (COLA)
increases. They want to calculate inflation by using a new chain weighted
CPI, which will understate inflation even
more than the current CPI they use.
Based on how the current CPI has been miscalculating inflation for decades,
Social Security recipients today should be receiving approximately triple
their current payments.
All Americans should be outraged that the
government is planning to once again reduce the deficit through deception,
when they should be eliminating wasteful government agencies like,
...while bringing our troops home from the
middle east and immediately cutting overseas military spending in
half so that we have the resources to better protect ourselves at home.
The extremely high levels of debt in both Europe and the U.S. need to be
liquidated as soon as possible. If Italy can't sustain itself with 7%
interest rates, which is only average on a historical basis, think about how
large the crisis will be in the U.S. when interest rates here reach 15% as
price inflation spirals out of control. Less than three months ago Italy's
interest rates were below 5%.
Fundamentally, Italy's economy is the same as it
was three months ago, but perceptions in the marketplace change quickly.
Today, U.S. treasuries are still perceived to be a safe haven, but this will
change 180 degrees in no time.
Just like how the U.S. government understates inflation when calculating
COLA adjustments, they also understate inflation when calculating GDP
growth. The U.S. recently reported 3Q GDP growth of 1.62% on a
year-over-year basis, which used a price deflator of only 2.52%. If they
used the real rate of price inflation, they would have reported negative GDP
growth.
The
Federal Reserve (FED) just lowered forecasts for U.S. GDP growth
in 2012 to between 2.5% and 2.9%, down from a forecast in June of between
3.3% and 3.7%.
In order to ensure that we even meet the FED's
new projections, the FED will soon be launching QE3. NIA predicts that the
FED will use fears of contagion from the European Debt Crisis as
their excuse for launching QE3 in the near-future.
Combined with massive inflation from Europe as
the ECB monetizes debt to save banks with exposure to Italian bonds, gold
will soon skyrocket to new all time highs with silver likely beginning to
once again outperform gold.
