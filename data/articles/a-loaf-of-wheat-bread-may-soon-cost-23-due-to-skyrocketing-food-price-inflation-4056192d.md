Within a decade, a loaf of wheat bread may cost
$23 in a grocery store in the United States, and a 32-oz package of sugar
might run $62.
A 64-oz container of Minute Maid Orange Juice,
meanwhile, could set you back $45.71. This is all according to a new report
released Friday by the National Inflation Association (NIA) which warns consumers
about the coming wave of food price inflation that's about to strike the
western world.
Authored by Gerard Adams, this report
makes the connection between the Fed's runaway money creation policy
("quantitative easing") and food price inflation (below
report).
"For every economic problem the U.S. government tries to solve, it always
creates two or three much larger catastrophes in the process," said Adams.
"Just like we predicted this past December, the U.S. dollar index bounced in
early 2010 and has been in free-fall ever since. Bernanke's QE2 will likely
accelerate this free-fall into a complete U.S. dollar rout."
The upshot of
a falling dollar will mean rampant price inflation on the
basic goods and services that Americans depend on to survive. Food in
particular is likely to be hit hard by price inflation within the decade.
The National Inflation Association has released its
food price projections.
It offers statements like this:
"NIA is confident that the upcoming
monetization of our debt will send nearly all agricultural commodities
soaring to new all time inflation adjusted highs."
The Federal Reserve, of course, is currently engaged in the most massive
money counterfeiting operation the world has ever witnessed. And it seems
determined to keep printing money until all the dollars the rest of us hold
are near-worthless.
Even the UN sees rising food prices
It's not just the NIA that sees a future with much higher food prices, by
the way: Both the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development as
well as the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization also predict rising food
prices (although not to the same prices as the NIA).
This is based on the trend of rising energy prices which directly translate
into
higher costs for farming, harvesting,
transporting and processing foods.
The UK Guardian newspaper is also reporting on "soaring food prices"
due to fast-rising commodity costs.
Make no mistake:
Food prices are on the rise. And with the Fed watering down
the dollar thanks to its insane money counterfeiting policies, the U.S. is
headed into a price inflation / dollar deflation scenario that mean you will
have to spent a lot more dollars to buy the same food in 2015 as you did in
2010. (If the dollar even exists in 2015, that is...)
What does this all mean to you and me?
As the spring comes back in a few
months, it might be a good time to start thinking about growing a little
garden for yourself.
NIA Projects Future U.S.
Food Price Increases

The National Inflation Association (NIA) today announced the release of its report
about NIA's projections of future U.S. food price increases due to the
massive monetary inflation being created by the Federal Reserve's $600
billion quantitative easing.
This report was written by NIA's President
Gerard Adams, who believes food inflation will take over in 2011 as
America's greatest crisis. According to Mr. Adams, making mortgage payments
will soon be the last thing on the minds of all Americans.
We currently have
a currency crisis that could soon turn into hyperinflation and a complete
societal collapse.
"For every economic problem the U.S. government tries to solve, it always
creates two or three much larger catastrophes in the process," said Adams.
"Just like we predicted this past December, the U.S. dollar index bounced in
early 2010 and has been in free-fall ever since. Bernanke's QE2 will likely
accelerate this free-fall into a complete U.S. dollar rout," warned Adams.
NIA projects that at the average U.S. grocery store it will soon cost,
-
$11.43
for one ear of corn
-
$23.05 for a 24 oz loaf of wheat bread
-
$62.21 for a 32
oz package of Domino Granulated Sugar
-
$24.31 for a 32 fl oz container of
soy milk
-
$77.71 for a 11.30 oz container of Folgers Classic Roast Coffee
-
$45.71 for a 64 fl oz container of Minute Maid Orange Juice
-
$15.50 for
a Hershey's Milk Chocolate 1.55 oz candy bar
NIA also projects that by the
end of this decade, a plain white men's cotton t-shirt at Wal-Mart will cost
$55.57.
NIA's special U.S. food price projection report is now available to download
for free by clicking here.
The report highlights how despite,
...during the months of September and October alone, these huge commodity price
increases have yet to make their way into America's grocery stores because
corporations have been reluctant to pass these price increases along to the
consumer.
In today's dismal economy, no retailer wants to be the first to
dramatically raise food prices.
However, NIA expects all retailers to soon
substantially raise food prices at the same time, which will ensure that
this Holiday shopping season will be the worst in recorded American history.
