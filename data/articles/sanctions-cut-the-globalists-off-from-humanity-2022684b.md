The first step in destroying an entrenched enemy is to cut them off from the
rest of the world.
-
The globalists of NATO
-
The US
-
UK
-
France
-
Qatar,
...and
others, have illustrated this principle
in Libya on several levels.
First they cut off the nation of Libya from the
outside world, putting arms and trade embargoes on the Libyan government,
blockading their shores, and seizing control of their airspace.
As Benghazi's Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG)
terror brigades swept across the country under NATO cover, raping,
murdering, and brutalizing all in their path, the globalists began
organizing the surrounding and cutting off of individual Libyan cities,
allowing (and assisting) rebels in cutting off food, medical supplies,
cooking gas, electricity, and unimaginably even water,
literally to starve
the populations into submission.
While the people of Libya have shown immense
resolve against this strategy, it is only because of the incompetence of
NATO and the lack of fortitude, character, or any desirable human quality
amongst the rebels that this process of isolating and besieging the Libyan
people has failed.
The absolute mockery the UN sanctioned NATO military intervention in Libya
is making out of the contrived notion of "Responsibility to Protect (R2P)"
is evident as civilians escaping from the Libyan city of Sirte accuse NATO
of genocide, of bombing schools, hospitals, and homes and mass murdering
innocent people.
Additionally, under the cover of NATO, entire
Libyan cities have been exterminated, with the population being rounded up,
murdered or exiled and their property stolen.
One such example, Tawarga, reported on by the
Telegraph in their article, "Gaddafi's ghost town after the loyalists
retreat," involved a town of 10,000 people whom the rebels said would never
be allowed to return to their homes.
Americans during World War II were asked to stand against fascism in Europe
and imperialism in East Asia, to intervene in the transgressions of Germany
and Japan against the sovereignty of neighboring nations. In hindsight, the
British and Americans were just as guilty at the time of grooming their own
empires, but hypocrisy aside, rising to the occasion to stop the building of
empire over free humanity is indeed a noble cause.
Who then will rise to the occasion today,
against the US, UK, France, Qatar, NATO's members and those backing the
illegitimate UN, contrived International Criminal Court and other
self-serving "international institutions" that are having their way with
this planet? Who? And how?
It isn't just Libya that is in the cross-hairs. Afghanistan has suffered a
decade of occupation and war at the hands of a banking, corporate-financier
cartel who call themselves "globalists."
Iraq too is suffering a proxy government
beholden to invading foreign powers. The people of Uganda are literally
being massacred so Anglo-American bankers can scoop up vast tracts of land
to fuel yet another Ponzi economic scam, one based not on fiat currency, but
even further-fetched "carbon credits."
When one looks at the vast amount of resources
at the disposal of the "globalists" they feel overwhelmed and not
unexpectedly ask what can anyone do against such brazen, reckless disregard
for human life, human sovereignty, and human rights?
The answer is staring us in the face every time we pick up the
corporate-newspapers or flip on the corporate-news channels and here the
word "sanctions."
We the people must slap sanctions on the
globalists, and it doesn't even require a UN mandate to do it. It simply
involves
identifying the corporations and institutions that are enabling the
globalist agenda, systematically
boycotting them, and eventually replacing
them entirely on a local or regional level.
There is nothing a multinational corporation can
do that the modern nation-state can't, and in many cases, nothing
multinationals can do that people can't do even on a local level. And as
technology advances in both terms of information and manufacturing, this
equation will only tip further in "we the people's" favor.
The ghouls of globalism have demonstrated without doubt their insincerity
over their proclaimed goals of establishing an "international order" based
on the rule of law, where "the rule of law" is applied to everyone but
themselves, who brazenly, and consistently violate even their own contrived
mandates, edicts, and resolutions when it suits them.
In Libya, the "Responsibility to Protect" turned
into targeted assassinations, regime change, and nation building (read:
neo-imperialism) before UNSC r.1973 came back from the printers - a foregone
conclusion 30 years in the making, spun only as "humanitarian intervention"
for public consumption.
Thus the globalists have demonstrated that they
are incapable of lording over humanity with their "international order," and
without doubt demonstrated the necessity of excising them and their
ill-conceived notion of "global governance" entirely from society at all
costs.
The globalists have procured this vast amount of impressive power only
through our own complicity.
We daily, monthly, yearly, and from generation
to generation pay into the vast, ever expanding corporations that make up
the global elite. We elect to shop at their stores, buy their products, use
their services, exchange their currency and keep that currency in their
banks. We elect to divert our time, energy, and attention to their corporate
sponsored spectacles, be it on the race track, the football field, the
basketball court or the baseball diamond.
We are told that our nation's destiny is
determined at the polls, and that the only way to effect real change is to
choose from amongst several, bought off, corrupt, self-serving politicians,
who needless to say, already serve the globalists, not the people. In
reality, we vote everyday, with a vote far more effective and far reaching
than anything that happens at election time.
We vote with our purchases, our choice of how we
spend our free time, and the way we utilize the resources we have at our
disposal.
It would then reason, that by not paying into the globalists' corporations,
institutions, and diverting ourselves with their distractions, we could
begin repealing much of this unwarranted power they have accumulated.
Eventually, we can begin replacing their corrupt, self-serving institutions
that span the globe and presume dominion over all humanity, with local
institutions that serve the people.
It is not something that will be done overnight,
it will take time.
Even the globalists, with their endless power,
must incrementally tighten their grip on their enemies, even ones as small
as Libya.
Surely everyone could easily do away
with
Coca-Cola and Pepsi today, as well as turning off the corporate-sponsored
diversions on TV and on the sports fields. If we can't perhaps we don't
deserve freedom or prosperity, but the mere, fleeting illusion of it we are
afforded by our globalist overlords when it suits them.
America's Founding Fathers would most likely be
appalled at how modern day Americans have pawned off self-reliance, freedom,
and independence for the illusion of security, convenience, and even
entertainment. We need to stop looking for heroes to save us, and simply
find ourselves a mirror. We are the key to our own salvation, as no one
cares about our best interests more than we the people, our families, and
our immediate communities.
Let us commit to putting "sanctions" on the globalists.
Cut these degenerate megalomaniacs off from the
world they so desire to dominate. Leave their stadiums empty, their airlines
destitute, their checkpoints desolate, their corporate troughs filled with
Chinese made slave goods virtual ghost towns, their banks as trusted and
relied upon for economic activity as that game of monopoly collecting dust
in the closet. Put them out of business, put them out of business forever.
They have demonstrated without a shadow of a
doubt that they, not some cave dwelling fundamentalist or Libyan colonel,
are the greatest threat we as humanity face.
