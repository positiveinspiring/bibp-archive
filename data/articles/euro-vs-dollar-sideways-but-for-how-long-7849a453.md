"Triangles appear to reflect a
balance of forces"
Frost & Prechter's Elliott
Wave Principle
Every time a new wave of the financial crisis
thunders over us, it restarts the debate about which of the world currencies
is "the safest."
Right now is no exception. So far the Swiss
franc has emerged as a clear leader, after making new all-time highs
against both the Euro and U.S. Dollar. Even so, the Euro and the buck have
locked horns as rivals for a while, and thus far neither one is giving up
its turf.
This is what a daily EUR/USD chart looks like
today:
As you can see, since early summer, the EUR/USD
has gone nowhere but sideways.
In the media, the explanations you read boil
down to this: Yes, Europe is in a sovereign debt crisis, but America has a
debt problem of its own. But to an Elliottician, that's not what jumps out
from this chart.
See how the summer's multi-week trading range is bound by converging
trendlines? That's an Elliott wave pattern called "contracting triangle."
They are sideways, overlapping moves labeled ABCDE, where each leg further
subdivides into three legs of its own.
But look past the technical analysis talk; here's the most important thing
about contracting triangles, from Frost & Prechter's Elliott Wave Principle:
"Triangles appear to reflect a balance of
forces, causing a sideways movement that is usually associated with
decreasing volume and volatility. Despite their sideways appearance, all
triangles... effect a net retracement of the preceding wave at wave e's
end."
Put differently, it says:
"All triangles end with a bang..."
The only question is, which direction will the
"bang" take now - up or down?
