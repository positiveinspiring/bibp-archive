The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is
using drug money to fund Rafael Correas opposition in the coming
2013 Ecuadorian elections, intelligence sources have revealed to Chilean
independent media.
The accusations do not stand alone. In October,
former UK diplomat Craig Murray said that the CIA had tripled its budget to
destabilize the government of Ecuador.
The
allegations were made public (below video) by President Rafael Correa on November 3rd
on national television, just days after his official visit to Chile to meet
with President Sebastian Piñera.

Correa reaffirmed information that
appeared in an article written by Chilean independent media outlet
Panoramas News, revealing that the CIA and DEA stations in Chile were
running a narcotics trafficking network through that country with the full
knowledge of Chilean authorities and police.
One of the sources quoted by Chilean media, a
former police officer in the Policia de Investigaciones (PDI) by the name of
Fernando Ulloa, said that 300 kilograms of cocaine were entering Chile
monthly under the escort of members of his own institution, the Carabineros,
and the Chilean Army.
In May 2011, Fernando Ulloa met with then Chilean
Minister of Interior Rodrigo Hinzpeter in La Moneda to inform him about the
drug network. After more than one year, the Piñeras government had done
nothing to investigate the case.
The scandal resurfaced again after 10 Chilean
cops were detained with links to a minor drug smuggling ring, not connected
to the one Ulloa was exposing.
Although Chilean television was more open to
talk about police corruption, Ulloa was only interviewed by two TV networks, where he accused
(below video)Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter of covering up the larger narcotics ring he was
investigating before being kicked out of his job as PDI inspector.
The links to US intelligence emerged after an
anonymous source from the Agencia Nacional de Inteligencia (ANI) told
Panoramas News that the smuggling of 300 kilos of cocaine was in fact a
highly sensitive CIA/DEA operation that would help to raise money to topple
the government of Ecuador.
The operation is similar to the one carried out
by the Agency in Central America during the Iran-Contra scandal in the
1980s, the source said.
The director of Panoramas News, journalist
Patricio Mery Bell, was planning to hand over the information to Rafael
Correa while the Ecuadorian President was visiting Chile, but he was
strangely accused of beating a woman after she stole his cell-phone.
The
cell-phone memory contained a video testimony of Merys intelligence source,
destined to be passed to Correa, but it ended up in the hands of the police
after the mysterious incident.
Once he was in Ecuador, President Rafael Correa
connected the dots and decided to go public with the information.
He quoted
Murrays early warnings about the CIAs intent to fund, bribe or blackmail
media and officials, originally written
in the former diplomats own blog, adding that the Agency was dealing
drugs just as Oliver North had done during the Contra support effort.
In an
interview with NTN24 (below video),
journalist Patricio Mery added more details to the case, relating the
cover-up of the CIA drug dealing operation to the deaths of two different
people in the last seven years:
-
former soldier Fabian Vega, who was found
hung in the northern city of Calama in 2005
-
young citizen Nestor Madariaga Juantok, found death with two bullets in the port of Valparaiso in
2006
Both were ruled as suicides...

Mery also gave the name of the alleged CIA
liaison with the Chilean Navy, former captain Jesus Saez Luna, who is now
being held in a penitentiary after he mysteriously escaped from Navy
custody.
Saez Luna was described in his arrest as the biggest drug dealer of
the coastal city of Viña del Mar, with networks in Santiago de Chile and the
Bio-Bio southern region of the country.
Known as El Marino, the former
captain utilized military intelligence tactics to avoid detection by
police,
according to the Chilean newspaper La Segunda.
The case is being depicted as Chile-Contras,
in reference to the history of CIA narcotics trafficking in Nicaragua.
This
is just another example of how drug money is used to fund covert operations,
such as the ones we have seen in Syria, with whole guerrilla armies and
opposition forces being financed to overthrow countries that arent part of
the Anglo-American establishment and dont bow to American corporate
interests.
