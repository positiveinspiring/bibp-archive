The Bush-Obama Wall Street bailout has
resulted in the deepening financialization of the US economy: Finance has
displaced the technology industry as the profitable sector of the US
economy.
While the US economy stagnates and the European
Union wallows in recession and with over 50 million unemployed, US financial
corporations in the Standard and Poor 500 index earned aggregate profits of
$49 billion in the second quarter of 2013, while the tech sector reported
$41.5 billion.
For 2013, Wall Street is projected to earn
$198.5 billion in profits, while tech companies are expected to earn $183.1
billion.
Within the financial sector, the most
speculative sectors, i.e. investment banks and brokerage houses, are
dominant and dynamic growing 40% in 2013. Over 20% of the S&P500 corporate
profits are concentrated in the financial sector.
The
financial crash of 2008-2009 and
the
Obama bailout, reinforced the dominance of Wall Street over
the US economy. The result is that the parasitic financial sector is
extracting enormous rents and profits from the economy and depriving the
productive industries of capital and earnings.
The recovery and boom of corporate profits since
the crises turns out to be concentrated in the same financial sector which
provoked the crash a few years back.
The Crises of Labor
Deepens - 2013
The new speculative bubble of 2012-2013 is a product of the central banks (the
Federal Reserve in the United States) low (virtually zero)
interest policies, which allow Wall Street to borrow cheaply and speculate,
activities which puff up stock prices but do not generate employment, and
furthermore depress industry and polarize the economy.
The Obama regimes promotion of financial profits is accompanied by its
policies reducing living standards for wage and salaried workers.
The White House and Congress have slashed public
spending on health, education and social services. They have cut funds for
the food stamps program (food subsidies for poor families), day care
centers, unemployment benefits, social security inflation adjustments,
Medicare and Medicare programs.
As a result the gap between the top 10% and the
bottom 90% has widened. Wages and salaries have declined in relative and
absolute terms, as employees take advantage of high unemployment (7.8%
official) underemployment (15%) and precarious employment.
In 2013 capitalist profits, especially in the financial capital, are booming
while the crises of labor persists, deepens and provokes political
alienation.
Outside of North America, especially in the
European periphery, mass unemployment and declining living standards has led
to mass protests and repeated general strikes.
-
In the first half of 2013 Greek workers
organized four general strikes protesting the massive firing of
public sector workers
-
In Portugal two general strikes have led
to calls for the resignation of the Prime Minister and new elections
-
In Spain corruption at the highest
level, fiscal austerity leading to 25% unemployment and repression
have led to intensifying street fighting and calls for the regime to
resign
The bi-polar world of rich bankers in the North
racking up record profits and workers everywhere receiving a shrinking share
of national income spells out the class basis of "recovery" and
"depression", prosperity for the few and immiseration for the many.
By the end of 2013, the imbalances between
finance and production foretell a new cycle of boom and bust.
Emblematic of the demise of the "productive
economy" is the city of
Detroits declaration of bankruptcy: with
79,000 vacant homes, stores and factories the city resembles Baghdad after
the US invasion - nothing works.
The Wall Street-devastated city, once the cradle
of both the auto industry and the organized industrial workers leap into
the middle-class, now has debts totaling $20 billion.
The big three auto companies have relocated overseas and to non-union states
while the billionaire bankers "restructure" the economy, break unions, lower
wages, renege on pensions and rule by administrative decree.
