As the world plunges deeper into chaos and darkness, everything is being
affected in one way or another.
The destructive energy is gaining strength
as more and more people are focusing on war and destruction. This is
happening at all levels. Individuals are stealing, destroying, assaulting
and murdering more frequently and much more senselessly. Even pre-teens are
commonly involved in serious assaults and homicides. Cruelty towards humans
and animals has reached a frightening level.
Gangs are more daring and
violent. Misfits from government, police and military forces are more
frequently assaulting and abusing private citizens. Nations are inclined
towards shooting wars and bullying of others. It is a very sad state of
affairs.
Extremists and zealots in any culture are troublesome. Whether they be
religious, political, environmental or otherwise extreme, they can pose real
danger, especially when they are affected by tunnel vision. Many of these
zealots claim to act for God. This was especially carried out in the
Crusades and the
Inquisitions.
There are now many violent acts that have been attributed to what the 'Qualas'
have called terrorism.
The Qualas have spread propaganda that all
terrorism is Muslim based. This is certainly not true. Terrorism has been
around throughout history. The West has used terrorism in many conventional
and irregular wars. It has been used against third-world countries by the
West. Certainly, Muslims do not have a monopoly on terrorism.
In Malaysia, there have been many incidents in the past where extremists
amongst the Muslim communities went on rampages and massacred Chinese
citizens. In America, extremists, under the guise of Christianity, have
terrorized Black citizens by burning crosses in their victims' own front
yards. Ku Klux Klan gangs have lynched people just for being Black. Such
repulsive terrorism infects
every religion, race and nation. It is senseless
and cowardly bullying.
Today, we have another cowardly zealot trying to incite hatred in the name
of God.
Pastor Terry Jones of the State of Florida in America has boasted
that he will burn the Koran. He claims that he will be performing this
insensitive act in protest of terrorism in the wake of September 11th. He
says that he will not call off his protest unless God tells him to cease.
This implies that he has a direct line to God.
Muslims around the world have already been persecuted over
September 11th.
This hatred and retaliation has got to stop, or chaos and darkness will
totally engulf the planet. As could be expected, Jones' arrogance and
ignorance have stirred Muslim zealots to call for the killing of Americans
everywhere. This dangerous eye-for-an-eye mentality has terrorized the world
for too long.
The Koran is the backbone for Islam, not to mention what it means to Muslim
culture.
A pastor, of all people, should know better than to incite hatred
and attack the very essence of the ethics behind all Islamic people. It
offends even moderate Muslims and compassionate non-Muslims. Burning the
Koran, or any other religious Bible, is senseless, hurtful and uncivilized.
Regardless of race, belief or politics, people should not excuse Jones'
despicable behavior. Christianity speaks of love; Jones promotes hatred.
One has to wonder whether Jones would be so brazen and bold in any Muslim
country. Would he dare to burn the Koran in Malaysia - in Indonesia - in
Syria? Even if God told him to do so?
Extremists are generally hate based. They exist all around the world. They
make a bad name for their respective nations, cultures and religions. It is
regrettable that zealots are given attention by the media and others.
As love is swamped by darkness on this planet, hatred will express more
violently and frequently. Hope was poured into Australia, but it was
squandered. Soon, that nation will feel intense swamping from darkness. Hope
will soon be given to America. It remains to be seen whether the United
States will open its heart.
The time for Jihads and Crusades has passed.
No Time For Jihads or Crusades...
