If
Endgame was the masters degree in understanding the long term goals of
the global elite and their quest for world government and population
reduction, then Endgame 1.5 is the advanced PhD course - it goes into
extensive detail about the origins of the blueprint for global enslavement,
what the near to mid-term goals of the
Bilderberg Group are, and how long we
have to stop their agenda.
Endgame 1.5 features bonus footage and extended interviews with experts
Michael Coffman, Daniel Estulin and Jim Tucker.
Dr. Michael Coffman documents the
Club of Rome's plan to
divide the
world into ten financial regions and how this agenda was codified by the UN
Commission on Global Governance, and how sustainable development and
environmental pretexts are used to monopolize infrastructure and stack up
the building blocks of world government.
Part 2 of Endgame 1.5 explodes onto the screen with unseen, and somewhat
satirical, footage of Alex Jones' crashing the Bilderbergers' party during
the 2006 meeting in Ottawa Canada, as well as serious interviews with
concerned citizens.
Endgame 1.5 ends with Part 3 with segments of Alex Jones' stirring speech in
front of the Capitol building in Texas as demonstrators protest the Trans
Texas Corridor and the sacrifice of American infrastructure and sovereignty
to global corporate interests.
