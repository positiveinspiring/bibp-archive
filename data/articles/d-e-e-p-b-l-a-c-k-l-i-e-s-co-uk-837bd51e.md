Affidavit signed by Alfredo R. Ramos attesting to the fact that he is the
legal executor/holder of accounts held in the name of Monaco registered
company, Diaz and Poirrotte Enterprises - a Santa Romano front company. The
identity of Alfredo R. Ramos remains somewhat of a mystery.
However, a possible identifying clue appears in a certificate of
ownership for seventeen tonnes of gold, dated 1980 in the name of DRA. Rosario
Romualdez Ramo. Romualdez is the
family name of Imelda Marcos. The family was descended from Spanish European stock and
sired by a Spanish priest. Imeldas
cousin, the family historian was Loreto Romualdez Ramos.
Armed with these facts, it is not hard to conclude that Alfredo Ramos is
a family cut-out.
