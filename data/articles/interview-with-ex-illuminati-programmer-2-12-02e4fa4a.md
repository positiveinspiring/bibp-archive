Q: Svali, a very important question I'm sure all our readers are
asking themselves is, who heads the Illuminati? Who is the top of
the pyramid?
A: Hooboy! Where do I start with this? First, it depends on what
level. I would like to draw up a little map of the Illuminati from
my memories (which are NOT FOND) of being part of this group. I will
also try to fill in some names, but I want to be cautious. If I name
too many names, I could draw some nasty fire from people in the
group. Here it goes:
I will be doing an upside down pyramid, to show the Illuminati
structure, NOT to trigger people (I know the Illuminati use lots of
pyramids) but because this is how they have their hierarchy set up:
Level One: Local level (anytown, USA)
sister group
There will be between ten and thirty
sister groups in most
metropolitan areas, dependent on the size of the city. The larger
the city, the more sister groups. There are Illuminati groups in
EVERY major city in the US and Europe. This first level is what is
known as the "anarchical" or "low level". It is what most people
reporting ritual abuse discuss: a high priest and priestess preside
over each group, which also contains a group of two to four
trainers, and others with jobs. The sister groups unite on rare
occasions, are aware of each other, but each one is fairly
independent, and reports only to their leadership council.
Level Two: Metropolitan leadership council
This is what the local leadership council over these groups will
look like. It will also cover scattered groups in outlying rural
areas.
Baalim (head) (1), assistants to the head (2) administrators over
finances and day to day happenings (4), head trainers (oversee and
teach other trainers) (6).
The total: 13 members
The Baalim and his two assistants report to:
REGIONAL LEADERSHIP COUNCIL
The United States has been divided into seven different regions
geographically. Each region has a 13 member leadership council that
coordinates with the local leadership councils (are you getting the
idea by now? The Illuminati are set up a lot like "Amway" or any
other well-organized business enterprise with a flowchart of
accountability for each member). This council will look something
like this:
Head of council (1), Military (2 seats), Spiritual (2 seats),
Scholarship (2 seats), Finances (2 seats), Training (2 seats),
Sciences (2 seats).
Total: 13 members
The regional councils will represent the different areas of interest
and knowledge that the Illuminati pursue. The membership will change
over time as members are promoted or demoted.
The seven regional councils each have a leader as noted above, who
reports to the:
National Council (The nations in Europe also have national councils,
Mexico and Canada do as well, as does the Soviet Republic and
China).
The national council will look much like the one above, with this
difference; these are influential bankers with OLD money such as:
The Rockefellers, the Mellon family, the Carnegie family, the
Rothschild family etc. I know I shouldn't name names, but I will.
The heads of the National councils report to:
The Supreme World Council.
This council is already set up as a prototype of the one that will
rule when the
NWO comes into being. It meets on a regular basis to
discuss finances, direction, policy, etc. and to problem-solve
difficulties that come up. Once again, these leaders are heads in
the financial world, OLD banking money. The
Rothschild family in
England, and in France, have ruling seats. A descendant of the
Hapsburg dynasty has a generational seat. A descendant of the ruling
families of England and France have a generational seat. The
Rockefeller family in the US holds a seat.
This is one reason that the Illuminati have been pretty
"untouchable" over the years. The ruling members are very, very,
very wealthy and powerful. I hope this information is helpful. How
do I know this? I was on a local leadership council (a head
trainer), but I talked to those on regional. Also, every Illuminati
child is taught who their "leaders" are, and told to take an oath of
allegiance to them and the "New Order to come".
Q: To what degree is the European royalty involved, what is their
real pecking order and power structure and what is their U.S.-U.K.
relationship in terms of financial/political/cult power. Is the
Monarchy still running the show?
A: This is hard to answer, but I'll try.
The Illuminati leadership
state that they are descended from royal bloodlines, as well as
unbroken occult heritage.
See, there were two definitions of "royalty" used.
Open royalty that
is currently seen now, and "hidden royalty" of royal lineage and
extreme occult power. Sometimes the two were concurrent, such as
with the Prince of Wales.
I never thought of which country/line held the most power, since I
was just a peon busily doing my job. But my understanding was:
-
The
Hanoverian / Hapsburg descendants rule in Germany over the Bruderheist.
-
They are considered one of the strongest lines for
occult as well.
-
The British line is just under them, with the royal
family.
-
Definitely, they rule the UK branch under the
Rothschilds in
the occult realm, even though parliament rules the country openly.
In France, again, descendants of the royal families are also in
power in the occult realm, but the French Rothschilds hold the
reigns over all or them. The U.S. is considered lower, and younger,
than the European branches. This is why the children of leaders are
ALWAYS sent to Europe for part of their training; the education is
considered better and the U.S. families want to renew their
affiliation with the european forebears.
Germany,
France, and the UK form a triumvirate that rules in the
European cult. The USSR is considered important, and has the
strongest military groups. The USSR has been promised fourth
position in the New World Order, BEFORE the role the U.S. would
have, because the USSR has been more helpful and cooperative over
the years with furthering the agenda.
The descendants of the former ruling families there are also
involved in the occult leadership, along with the newer ones. There
is no marxism in the cult. China will be ranked after the
USSR, then
the U.S.. But a lot of the current U.S. leadership will be in Europe
when the change occurs, and many have homes there. They will be
"changing nationalities" overnight, as it were. This is the little
that I do remember. Wish I had been a better student of this stuff,
but I was too busy trying to stay alive when I was in it.
