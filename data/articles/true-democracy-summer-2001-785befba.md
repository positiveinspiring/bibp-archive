Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Intelligence
This agency would seem to be necessary. However, allow me to advise you
why it is not. In addition to it not performing its function very well because
the War on Drugs is designed purely to incarcerate the low level drug abuser
and dealer, the DEA countermands the decent drug agent to prevent confiscation
of the drugs.
To document this illegality, read Deep Cover by Michael Levine.
Mr. Levine was a career DEA agent who tried to do his job extremely well.
He writes that he was prevented from consummating one of the biggest drug
busts on record because the CIA deliberately told his superiors to botch
the deal risking his life in the process.
Further, Enrique Camarena lost his life because of his work. This agency
is responsible, therefore, for loss of life and needs to be disbanded.
The CIA is the biggest purchaser of illegal drugs. That is documented by
the CIA itself in a report.
