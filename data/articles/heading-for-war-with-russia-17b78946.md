Ukraine is the epicenter of possible European war. Ongoing events should scare everyone. Kiev's war on Donbas rages. Area freedom fighters continue routing its military. It's desperate for more Western support. Wanting greater numbers of US-led NATO boots on the ground than are already involved in fighting. Three recent regime false flags didn't achieve Kiev's objective. Perhaps something major is planned. A Kiev 9/11. Big enough to embroil Europe in war. Meaning East/West confrontation. America v. Russia. Possible nuclear war. It bears repeating what previous articles stressed. Today is the most perilous time in world history.
Thursday Stop NATO reports are disturbing.
"US Army Trains for New War in Europe," reported editor Rick Rozoff.
Exercise 'Allied Spirit I' involves America, Britain, Canada, Hungary and the Netherlands.
Continuing through January 31.
"(D)esigned to provide multinational interoperability training at brigade and battalion levels to enhance US and (NATO's) effectiveness."
In other words, prepare for potential war with Russia.
According to US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) commander General David Perkins:
America's military is responsible for, "synchronizing and delivering national power (to) seize, retain and exploit the initiative and maintain relative advantage over all enemies."
America's military is responsible for,
"synchronizing and delivering national power (to) seize, retain and exploit the initiative and maintain relative advantage over all enemies."
Prepare for an eventual US/Russia military showdown if current political and economic war fails to achieve Washington's objective. Namely, turning Russia into another US colony. Eliminating a major rival. Controlling its resources. Exploiting its people.
Part of America's strategy for unchallenged global dominance. Waging permanent wars to achieve it. Ongoing in Europe's heartland. Kiev's war on Donbas rages.
Threatens to become much more than civil war.
"NATO Backs Ukraine Client in 290-Day War: Stoltenberg," headlined Stop NATO.
Secretary-General Stoltenberg is a convenient US-controlled front man. NATO's number two is number one, its Ã©minence gris.
Deputy Secretary-General Alexander Vershbow runs things. A former Assistant Defense Secretary for International Security Affairs. Clinton's National Security Council European Affairs director. A former US ambassador to Russia. Calling Moscow "more an enemy than partner."
Intends NATO measures to counter nonexistent Russian aggression. Including stepped up US military presence near its border. America's dirty hands risk the unthinkable. War with Russia means all bets are off. Supporting Kiev's war on Donbas increases the possibility.
On Thursday, Stoltenberg met with Ukraine's illegitimate foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin. Expressed concern about nonexistent,
"support of Russia to the separatists."
Telling Klimkin,
"we will continue to support you, and we will work with you, with strong support to the independence and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine."
Saying NATO,
"support(s) all efforts (for) a peaceful solution based on the Minsk agreements."
While systematically violating them... Arming, funding and training Kiev's military. Participating in its war on Donbas. Disingenuously talking peace. Waging dirty war without mercy. Showing no signs of ending. Heading for potentially much greater conflict than already. Ukraine is effectively bankrupt. Its economy deeply in tatters. Outside aid alone keeps it from disintegrating. Whether enough remains to be seen. At the same time, military spending increases.
So-called defense is the only sector of Ukraine's economy showing growth. Illegitimate oligarch president Poroshenko said,
"(t)his year we plan to increase strength of the armed forces of Ukraine up to 250,000 people."
In other words, preparing for greater conflict. Backed by US-dominated NATO. Risking far greater war than already.
"NATO Trains Very High Readiness Joint Task Force For War With Russia," reported Stop NATO. "Consisting of land, air, sea and 'special operations' as needed. (A)ble to deploy within a few days to respond to any challenges that may arise on NATO's flanks."
"NATO Trains Very High Readiness Joint Task Force For War With Russia," reported Stop NATO.
"Consisting of land, air, sea and 'special operations' as needed. (A)ble to deploy within a few days to respond to any challenges that may arise on NATO's flanks."
Code language for possible war on Russia? It remains to be seen.
US-dominated NATO policy heads dangerously in this direction. Obama wants congressional authorization for unconstrained war. On the phony pretext of combating IS. Syria, Iran, Donbas freedom fighters and Russia the real targets. With lunatics running things in Washington, expect continued wars without end ahead. Michel Chossudovsky new book titled "The Globalization of War: America's 'Long War' against Humanity" is essential reading. Like nothing in human history preceding it.
"Major military and covert intelligence operations are (ongoing) in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia and the Far East," Chossudovsky explains.
Combining,
"major theater operations (and) covert actions geared towards destabilizing sovereign states."
US-dominated NATO partnered with Israel coordinate global conflicts,
"at the highest levels of (Western) military hierarchy."
Political and economic wars accompany them.
At stake is humanity's survival. It's very much up for grabs. Challenging Russia irresponsibly risks crossing an unthinkable red line. Risking potential military confrontation. On December 4, US House members barely stopped short of declaring war on Russia. Overwhelmingly passing a non-binding resolution. Signaling hostile US intentions. Former Congressman Denis Kucinich said at the time:
"NATO encirclement, the US-backed coup in Ukraine, an attempt to use an agreement with the European Union to bring NATO into Ukraine at the Russian border, a US nuclear first-strike policy, are all policies which attempt to substitute force for diplomacy."
Heading things dangerously toward open confrontation. The unthinkable. Possible nuclear war. Last May, Senate members introduced S. 2277: Russian Aggression Prevention Act of 2014. Its full title is,
"(a) bill to prevent Russian aggression toward Ukraine and other sovereign states in Europe and Eurasia, and for other purposes."
Senator Bob Corker (R. TN) introduced it with 26 Republican co-sponsors.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee members considered it. No action was taken so far. Perhaps in the new Congress. Obama as anti-Russian as congressional hawks. Fascists making policy. Proposed legislation provides,
"major non-NATO ally status for Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova for purposes of the transfer or possible transfer of defense articles or defense services."
Effectively incorporating these countries into NATO. Making its killing machine more formidable. Letting Washington establish bases on Russia's border. Challenging Moscow irresponsibly. Risking direct East/West confrontation. Ongoing events risk the worst possible outcome.
Chossudovsky is clear and unequivocal saying,
"Americas s global military design has been one of world conquest." "War and globalization are intricately related. Militarization supports powerful economic interests." "Americas 'Long War' is geared towards worldwide corporate expansion and the conquest of new economic frontiers."
US-dominated NATO partnered with Israel and other rogue states comprise,
"a formidable military force, deployed in all major regions of the World."
Targeting all independent countries for regime change, including,
Russia China Iran Syria North Korea Venezuela Hezbollah in Lebanon,
Russia
China
Iran
Syria
North Korea
Venezuela
Hezbollah in Lebanon,
...and others. Potential US-instigated nuclear war threatens humanity's survival. MSM propaganda increases the possibility. So does public indifference. Anti-war activism is absent. More than ever needed to stop America's hegemonic madness. Its "long war" rages. No end in sight looms.
Either we find a way to end it or it'll end us.
A Final Comment On Thursday, EU foreign ministers met in Brussels. Extended economic/financial sanctions on Russia through September. Agreed to consider additional ones. To be decided when ministers meet on February 9. A statement issued lied. Blaming Russia for "continued and growing" support for Donbas rebels. Saying Moscow shares "responsibility" for escalated conflict. Russia and Donbas freedom fighters are consistently blamed for Kiev's crimes. Greece's new government expressed phony rhetorical opposition to renewed sanctions. Its Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias approved them. Brussels unity was required to do so.
"We are not the bad boy," Kotzias maintained.
Saying one thing. Doing another shows what ordinary Greeks can expect from its new government. A previous article called it business as usual wrapped in populist rhetoric. Betrayal after promising real change. Moscow's EU ambassador Vladimir Chizhov commented saying:
"By acting in such a narrow-minded way, the EU in essence is subjecting to additional tests our partnership - the partnership between Russia and the European Union, which is regrettable." "(B)esides selective assessments of these or those events, sweeping criticism of Russia is the dominating element." "As if Russia, and not the Kiev authorities with the connivance of the EU, had unfolded the bloodbath in eastern Ukraine." "The call for implementation of the Minsk agreements contrasts with statements heard in the past few days from the Ukrainian capital that they are no longer content with the Minsk agreements and its necessary to seek another format." "But while these conversations can be heard, shelling of residential districts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Gorlovka continue."
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini,
"while summing up the meeting on Thursday, selected three components in the EU's reaction to deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine. Unfortunately, all three are wrong."
On Thursday, Putin said Russia,
"must overcome the pressure of external factors by means of strengthening its economic and financial sovereignty." "The current period is not easy," he explained. "(B)ut nothing unexpected has happened. The crisis developments were expected."
Russia won't surrender its political and economic sovereignty.
Putin promised new measures for,
"additional stability against external shocks "
Including,
"diversification, the growth of non-energy, high technology, agriculture, and the national financial and banking sector."
At the same time, he intends confronting major Western challenges diplomatically. Given America's rage for regime change, he'll need tough-minded policies with teeth.
The only thing US lunatics running things understand.
