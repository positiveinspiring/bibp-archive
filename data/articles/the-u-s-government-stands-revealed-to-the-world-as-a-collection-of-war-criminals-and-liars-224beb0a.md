Does the American public have the strength of
character to face the fact that the US government stands before the entire
world revealed as a collection of war criminals who lie every time that they
open their mouth?
Will Congress and the American public buy the
White House lie that they must support war criminals and liars or America
will lose face?
The obama
regimes lies are so transparent and blatant that the cautious,
diplomatic President Putin of Russia lost his patience and stated the
fact that we all already know:
John Kerry is a liar.
Putin
said:
This was very unpleasant and surprising for
me. We talk to them [the Americans], and we assume they are decent
people, but he [Kerry] is lying and he knows that he is lying. This is
sad.
When Secretary of State Colin Powell was
sent by the criminal bush regime to lie to the UN, Powell and his chief of
staff claim that Powell did not know he was lying.
It did not occur to the Secretary of State that
the White House would send him to the UN to start a war that killed, maimed,
and dispossessed millions of Iraqis on the basis of total lies.
The despicable John Kerry knows that he is lying. Here is the American
Secretary of State,
and obama, the puppet president, knowingly
lying to the world. There is not a shred of integrity in the US government.
No respect for truth, justice, morality or human life.
Here are two people so evil that they want to
repeat in Syria what the bush war criminals did in Iraq.
-
The obama regime has every quality of
Nazi Germany and Stasi Communist Germany, only that the obama regime
is worse.
-
The obama regime spies on the entire
world and lies about it.
-
The obama regime is fully engaged in
killing people in seven countries, a murderous rampage that not even
Hitler attempted.
Whether the criminal obama regime can purchase
the collaboration of Congress and the European puppet states in a
transparent war crime will soon be decided.
The decision will determine the fate of the
world.
As for facts,
the report released to the UN by the Russian
government concludes that the weapons used in chemical attacks in
Syria are similar to the weapons in the hands of al-Nusra and are different
from the weapons known to be possessed by Syria.
The obama regime has released no evidence to
the
United Nations.
This is because the criminal regime has no
evidence, only made up fairy tales.
If the obama regime had any evidence, the evidence would have been released
to British Prime Minister david cameron to enable him to carry
the vote of Parliament.
In the absence of evidence, cameron had to admit
to Parliament that he had no evidence, only a belief that the Syrian
government had used chemical weapons. Parliament told Washingtons puppet
that the British people were not going to war on the basis of the Prime
Ministers unsubstantiated belief.
Are the American people and the rest of the world just going to stand there,
sucking their thumbs, while a new Nazi State rises in Washington?
Congress must vote down the war and make it clear to obama that if he
defies the constitutional power of Congress he will be
impeached.
If the US Congress is too corrupt or incompetent to do its duty, the rest of
the world must join the UN General Secretary and the President of Russia and
declare that unilateral military aggression by the US government is a war
crime, and that the war criminal US government will be isolated in the
international community.
Any of its members caught traveling abroad will
be arrested and turned over to the Hague for trial.
