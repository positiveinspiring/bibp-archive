The democracy
uprising in the Arab world has been a spectacular display of
courage, dedication, and commitment by popular forces - coinciding,
fortuitously, with a remarkable uprising of tens of thousands in support of
working people and democracy in Madison, Wisconsin, and other U.S. cities.
If the trajectories of revolt in Cairo and
Madison intersected, however, they were headed in opposite directions: in
Cairo toward gaining elementary rights denied by the dictatorship, in
Madison towards defending rights that had been won in long and hard
struggles and are now under severe attack.
Each is a microcosm of tendencies in global society, following varied
courses.
There are sure to be far-reaching consequences
of what is taking place both in the decaying industrial heartland of the
richest and most powerful country in human history, and in what President
Dwight Eisenhower called,
"the most strategically important area in
the world" - "a stupendous source of strategic power" and "probably the
richest economic prize in the world in the field of foreign investment,"
...in the words of the State Department in the
1940s, a prize that the U.S. intended to keep for itself and its allies in
the unfolding New World Order of that day.
Despite all the changes since, there is every reason to suppose that today's
policy-makers basically adhere to the judgment of President Franklin Delano
Roosevelts influential advisor A.A. Berle that control of the incomparable
energy reserves of the Middle East would yield "substantial control of the
world."
And correspondingly, that loss of control would threaten the project
of global dominance that was clearly articulated during World War II, and
that has been sustained in the face of major changes in world order since
that day.
From the outset of the war in 1939, Washington anticipated that it would end
with the U.S. in a position of overwhelming power.
High-level State
Department officials and foreign policy specialists met through the wartime
years to lay out plans for the postwar world. They delineated a "Grand Area"
that the U.S. was to dominate, including,
As Russia began to grind down Nazi armies after
Stalingrad, Grand Area goals extended to as much of Eurasia as possible, at
least its economic core in Western Europe.
Within the Grand Area, the U.S.
would maintain "unquestioned power," with "military and economic supremacy,"
while ensuring the "limitation of any exercise of sovereignty" by states
that might interfere with its global designs.
The careful wartime plans were soon implemented.
It was always recognized that Europe might choose to follow an independent
course. NATO was partially intended to counter this threat. As soon as the
official pretext for NATO dissolved in 1989, NATO was expanded to the East
in violation of verbal pledges to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
It has since become a U.S.-run intervention
force, with far-ranging scope, spelled out by NATO Secretary-General Jaap de
Hoop Scheffer, who informed a NATO conference that,
"NATO troops have to
guard pipelines that transport oil and gas that is directed for the West,"
...and more generally to protect sea routes used by tankers and other "crucial
infrastructure" of the energy system.
Grand Area doctrines clearly license military intervention at will.
That conclusion was articulated clearly by the
Clinton administration, which declared that the U.S. has the right to use
military force to ensure,
"uninhibited access to key markets, energy
supplies, and strategic resources," and must maintain huge military
forces "forward deployed" in Europe and Asia "in order to shape people's
opinions about us" and "to shape events that will affect our livelihood
and our security."
The same principles governed the invasion of
Iraq.
As the U.S. failure to impose its will in Iraq
was becoming unmistakable, the actual goals of the invasion could no longer
be concealed behind pretty rhetoric. In November 2007, the White House
issued a Declaration of Principles demanding that U.S. forces must remain
indefinitely in Iraq and committing Iraq to privilege American investors.
Two months later, President
Bush informed
Congress that he would reject legislation that might limit the permanent
stationing of U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq or "United States control of the oil
resources of Iraq" - demands that the U.S. had to abandon shortly after in
the face of Iraqi resistance.
In Tunisia and Egypt, the recent popular uprisings have won impressive
victories, but as the
Carnegie Endowment reported, while names have changed,
the regimes remain:
"A change in ruling elites and system of
governance is still a distant goal."
The report discusses internal barriers to
democracy, but ignores the external ones, which as always are significant.
The U.S. and its Western allies are sure to do whatever they can to prevent
authentic democracy in the Arab world. To understand why, it is only
necessary to look at the studies of Arab opinion conducted by U.S. polling
agencies. Though barely reported, they are certainly known to planners.
They reveal that by overwhelming majorities,
Arabs regard the U.S. and Israel as the major threats they face:
the U.S. is
so regarded by 90% of Egyptians, in the region generally by over 75%. Some
Arabs regard Iran as a threat: 10%.
Opposition to U.S. policy is so strong that a
majority believes that security would be improved if Iran had nuclear
weapons - in Egypt, 80%. Other figures are similar.
If public opinion were to influence policy, the
U.S. not only would not control the region, but would be expelled from it,
along with its allies, undermining fundamental principles of global
dominance.
The Invisible Hand of
Power
Support for democracy is the province of ideologists and propagandists. In
the real world, elite dislike of democracy is the norm.
The evidence is overwhelming that democracy is
supported insofar as it contributes to social and economic objectives, a
conclusion reluctantly conceded by the more serious scholarship.
Elite contempt for democracy was revealed dramatically in the reaction to
the WikiLeaks exposures. Those that received most attention, with euphoric
commentary, were cables reporting that Arabs support the U.S. stand on Iran.
The reference was to the ruling dictators. The attitudes of the public were
unmentioned.
The guiding principle was articulated clearly by
Carnegie Endowment Middle East specialist Marwan Muasher, formerly a high
official of the Jordanian government:
"There is nothing wrong, everything is under
control."
In short, if the dictators support us, what else
could matter?
The Muasher doctrine is rational and venerable. To mention just one case
that is highly relevant today, in internal discussion in 1958, president
Eisenhower expressed concern about "the campaign of hatred" against us in
the Arab world, not by governments, but by the people.
The National Security Council (NSC) explained
that there is a perception in the Arab world that the U.S. supports
dictatorships and blocks democracy and development so as to ensure control
over the resources of the region. Furthermore, the perception is basically
accurate, the NSC concluded, and that is what we should be doing, relying on
the Muasher doctrine.
Pentagon studies conducted after
9/11 confirmed
that the same holds today.
It is normal for the victors to consign history to the trash can, and for
victims to take it seriously. Perhaps a few brief observations on this
important matter may be useful. Today is not the first occasion when Egypt
and the U.S. are facing similar problems, and moving in opposite directions.
That was also true in the early nineteenth century.
Economic historians have argued that Egypt was well-placed to undertake
rapid economic development at the same time that the U.S. was.
Both had rich agriculture, including cotton, the
fuel of the early industrial revolution - though unlike Egypt, the U.S. had
to develop cotton production and a work force by conquest, extermination,
and slavery, with consequences that are evident right now in the
reservations for the survivors and the prisons that have rapidly expanded
since the Reagan years to house the superfluous population left by
deindustrialization.
One fundamental difference was that the U.S. had gained independence and was
therefore free to ignore the prescriptions of economic theory, delivered at
the time by
Adam Smith in terms rather like those preached to developing
societies today.
Smith urged the liberated colonies to produce primary
products for export and to import superior British manufactures, and
certainly not to attempt to monopolize crucial goods, particularly cotton.
Any other path, Smith warned,
"would retard instead of accelerating the
further increase in the value of their annual produce, and would
obstruct instead of promoting the progress of their country towards real
wealth and greatness."
Having gained their independence, the colonies
were free to ignore his advice and to follow England's course of independent
state-guided development, with high tariffs to protect industry from British
exports, first textiles, later steel and others, and to adopt numerous other
devices to accelerate industrial development.
The independent Republic also sought to gain a
monopoly of cotton so as to "place all other nations at our feet,"
particularly the British enemy, as the Jacksonian presidents announced when
conquering Texas and half of Mexico.
For Egypt, a comparable course was barred by British power.
Lord Palmerston declared that,
"no ideas of
fairness [toward Egypt] ought to stand in the way of such great and
paramount interests",
...of Britain as preserving its economic and political
hegemony, expressing his "hate" for the "ignorant barbarian" Muhammed Ali
who dared to seek an independent course, and deploying Britain's fleet and
financial power to terminate Egypt's quest for independence and economic
development.
After World War II, when the U.S. displaced Britain as global hegemony,
Washington adopted the same stand, making it clear that the U.S. would
provide no aid to Egypt unless it adhered to the standard rules for the weak
- which the U.S. continued to violate, imposing high tariffs to bar Egyptian
cotton and causing a debilitating dollar shortage.
The usual interpretation of market principles.
It is small wonder that the "campaign of hatred" against the U.S. that
concerned Eisenhower was based on the recognition that the U.S. supports
dictators and blocks democracy and development, as do its allies.
In Adam Smith's defense, it should be added that he recognized what would
happen if Britain followed the rules of sound economics, now called "neoliberalism."
He warned that if British manufacturers, merchants, and investors turned
abroad, they might profit but England would suffer. But he felt that they
would be guided by a home bias, so as if by an invisible hand England would
be spared the ravages of economic rationality.
The passage is hard to miss. It is the one occurrence of the famous phrase
"invisible hand" in
The Wealth of Nations.
The other leading founder of classical
economics, David Ricardo, drew similar conclusions, hoping that home bias
would lead men of property to,
"be satisfied with the low rate of profits
in their own country, rather than seek a more advantageous employment
for their wealth in foreign nations," feelings that, he added, "I should
be sorry to see weakened."
Their predictions aside, the instincts of the
classical economists were sound.
The Iranian and
Chinese Threats
The democracy uprising in the Arab world is sometimes compared to Eastern
Europe in 1989, but on dubious grounds.
In 1989, the democracy uprising was tolerated by
the Russians, and supported by western power in accord with standard
doctrine:
it plainly conformed to economic and strategic objectives, and was
therefore a noble achievement, greatly honored, unlike the struggles at the
same time "to defend the people's fundamental human rights" in Central
America, in the words of the assassinated Archbishop of El Salvador, one of
the hundreds of thousands of victims of the military forces armed and
trained by Washington.
There was no Gorbachev in the West throughout
these horrendous years, and there is none today. And Western power remains
hostile to democracy in the Arab world for good reasons.
Grand Area doctrines continue to apply to contemporary crises and
confrontations. In Western policy-making circles and political commentary
the Iranian threat is considered to pose the greatest danger to world order
and hence must be the primary focus of U.S. foreign policy, with Europe
trailing along politely.
What exactly is the Iranian threat?
An authoritative answer is provided by the
Pentagon and U.S. intelligence. Reporting on global security last year, they
make it clear that the threat is not military.
Iran's military spending is,
"relatively low compared to the rest of the region," they conclude. Its
military doctrine is strictly, "defensive, designed to slow an invasion and
force a diplomatic solution to hostilities."
Iran has only,
"a limited capability to project force
beyond its borders."
With regard to the nuclear option,
"Iran's nuclear program and its willingness
to keep open the possibility of developing nuclear weapons is a central
part of its deterrent strategy."
All quotes.
The brutal clerical regime is doubtless a threat to its own people, though
it hardly outranks U.S. allies in that regard. But the threat lies
elsewhere, and is ominous indeed. One element is Iran's potential deterrent
capacity, an illegitimate exercise of sovereignty that might interfere with
U.S. freedom of action in the region. It is glaringly obvious why Iran would
seek a deterrent capacity; a look at the military bases and nuclear forces
in the region suffices to explain.
Seven years ago, Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld wrote that,
"The world has witnessed how the United
States attacked Iraq for, as it turned out, no reason at all. Had the
Iranians not tried to build nuclear weapons, they would be crazy,"
particularly when they are under constant threat of attack in violation
of the UN Charter.
Whether they are doing so remains an open
question, but perhaps so.
But Iran's threat goes beyond deterrence. It is also seeking to expand its
influence in neighboring countries, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence
emphasize, and in this way to "destabilize" the region (in the technical
terms of foreign policy discourse). The U.S. invasion and military
occupation of Iran's neighbors is "stabilization."
Iran's efforts to extend its influence to them
are "destabilization," hence plainly illegitimate.
Such usage is routine.
Thus the prominent foreign policy analyst James Chace
was properly using the term "stability" in its technical sense when he
explained that in order to achieve "stability" in Chile it was necessary to
"destabilize" the country (by overthrowing the elected government of
Salvador Allende and installing the dictatorship of General Augusto
Pinochet).
Other concerns about Iran are equally
interesting to explore, but perhaps this is enough to reveal the guiding
principles and their status in imperial culture. As Franklin Delano
Roosevelts planners emphasized at the dawn of the contemporary world
system, the U.S. cannot tolerate "any exercise of sovereignty" that
interferes with its global designs.
The U.S. and Europe are united in punishing Iran for its threat to
stability, but it is useful to recall how isolated they are. The nonaligned
countries have vigorously supported Iran's right to enrich uranium. In the
region, Arab public opinion even strongly favors Iranian nuclear weapons.
The major regional power, Turkey, voted against the latest U.S.-initiated
sanctions motion in the Security Council, along with Brazil, the most
admired country of the South.
Their disobedience led to sharp censure, not for
the first time:
Turkey had been bitterly condemned in 2003 when the
government followed the will of 95% of the population and refused to
participate in the invasion of Iraq, thus demonstrating its weak grasp of
democracy, western-style.
After its Security Council misdeed last year, Turkey was warned by Obama's
top diplomat on European affairs, Philip Gordon, that it must,
"demonstrate
its commitment to partnership with the West."
A scholar with the
Council on
Foreign Relations asked,
"How do we keep the Turks in their lane?" -
following orders like good democrats.
Brazil's Lula was admonished in a New
York Times headline that his effort with Turkey to provide a solution to the
uranium enrichment issue outside of the framework of U.S. power was a "Spot
on Brazilian Leader's Legacy."
In brief, do what we say, or else.
An interesting sidelight, effectively suppressed, is that the
Iran-Turkey-Brazil deal was approved in advance by Obama, presumably on the
assumption that it would fail, providing an ideological weapon against Iran.
When it succeeded, the approval turned to
censure, and Washington rammed through a Security Council resolution so weak
that China readily signed - and is now chastised for living up to the letter
of the resolution but not Washington's unilateral directives - in the
current issue of Foreign Affairs, for example.
While the U.S. can tolerate Turkish disobedience, though with dismay, China
is harder to ignore.
The press warns that,
"China's investors and traders are
now filling a vacuum in Iran as businesses from many other nations,
especially in Europe, pull out,"
...and in particular, is expanding its
dominant role in Iran's energy industries.
Washington is reacting with a touch of
desperation.
The State Department warned China that if it
wants to be accepted in the international community - a technical term
referring to the U.S. and whoever happens to agree with it - then it must
not,
"skirt and evade international
responsibilities, [which] are clear": namely, follow U.S. orders.
China is unlikely to be impressed.
There is also much concern about the growing Chinese military threat.
A
recent Pentagon study warned that China's military budget is approaching,
"one-fifth of what the Pentagon spent to
operate and carry out the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan," a fraction of
the U.S. military budget, of course. China's expansion of military
forces might "deny the ability of American warships to operate in
international waters off its coast," the New York Times added.
Off the coast of China, that is; it has yet to
be proposed that the U.S. should eliminate military forces that deny the
Caribbean to Chinese warships.
China's lack of understanding of rules of
international civility is illustrated further by its objections to plans for
the advanced nuclear-powered aircraft carrier George Washington to join
naval exercises a few miles off China's coast, with alleged capacity to
strike Beijing.
In contrast, the West understands that such U.S. operations are all
undertaken to defend stability and its own security.
The liberal New Republic expresses its concern
that,
"China sent ten warships through
international waters just off the Japanese island of Okinawa."
That is indeed a provocation - unlike the fact,
unmentioned, that Washington has converted the island into a major military
base in defiance of vehement protests by the people of Okinawa. That is not
a provocation, on the standard principle that we own the world.
Deep-seated imperial doctrine aside, there is good reason for China's
neighbors to be concerned about its growing military and commercial power.
And though Arab opinion supports an Iranian nuclear weapons program, we
certainly should not do so. The foreign policy literature is full of
proposals as to how to counter the threat.
One obvious way is rarely discussed: work to
establish a nuclear-weapons-free zone (NWFZ) in the region.
The issue arose
(again) at the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) conference at United Nations
headquarters last May. Egypt, as chair of the 118 nations of the Non-Aligned
Movement, called for negotiations on a Middle East NWFZ, as had been agreed
by the West, including the U.S., at the 1995 review conference on the NPT.
International support is so overwhelming that Obama formally agreed. It is a
fine idea, Washington informed the conference, but not now.
Furthermore, the U.S. made clear that Israel
must be exempted: no proposal can call for Israel's nuclear program to be
placed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency or for
the release of information about,
"Israeli nuclear facilities and
activities."
So much for this method of dealing with the
Iranian nuclear threat.
Privatizing the Planet
While Grand Area doctrine still prevails, the capacity to implement it has
declined.
The peak of U.S. power was after World War II,
when it had literally half the world's wealth. But that naturally declined,
as other industrial economies recovered from the devastation of the war and
decolonization took its agonizing course.
By the early 1970s, the U.S. share of global
wealth had declined to about 25%, and the industrial world had become
tripolar:
There was also a sharp change in the U.S.
economy in the 1970s, towards financialization and export of production.
A variety of factors converged to create a
vicious cycle of radical concentration of wealth, primarily in the top
fraction of 1% of the population - mostly CEOs, hedge-fund managers, and the
like. That leads to the concentration of political power, hence state
policies to increase economic concentration: fiscal policies, rules of
corporate governance, deregulation, and much more.
Meanwhile the costs of electoral campaigns
skyrocketed, driving the parties into the pockets of concentrated capital,
increasingly financial: the Republicans reflexively, the Democrats - by now
what used to be moderate Republicans - not far behind.
Elections have become a charade, run by the public relations industry. After
his 2008 victory, Obama won an award from the industry for the best
marketing campaign of the year. Executives were euphoric.
In the business press they explained that they
had been marketing candidates like other commodities since Ronald Reagan,
but 2008 was their greatest achievement and would change the style in
corporate boardrooms. The 2012 election is expected to cost $2 billion,
mostly in corporate funding. Small wonder that Obama is selecting business
leaders for top positions.
The public is angry and frustrated, but as long
as the Muasher principle prevails, that doesn't matter.
While wealth and power have narrowly concentrated, for most of the
population real incomes have stagnated and people have been getting by with
increased work hours, debt, and asset inflation, regularly destroyed by the
financial crises that began as the regulatory apparatus was dismantled
starting in the 1980s.
None of this is problematic for the very wealthy, who benefit from a
government insurance policy called "too big to fail." The banks and
investment firms can make risky transactions, with rich rewards, and when
the system inevitably crashes, they can run to the nanny state for a
taxpayer bailout, clutching their copies of Friedrich Hayek and Milton
Friedman.
That has been the regular process since the Reagan years, each crisis more
extreme than the last - for the public population, that is.
Right now, real unemployment is at Depression
levels for much of the population, while Goldman Sachs, one of the main
architects of the current crisis, is richer than ever. It has just quietly
announced $17.5 billion in compensation for last year, with CEO Lloyd Blankfein receiving a $12.6 million bonus while his base salary more than
triples.
It wouldn't do to focus attention on such facts as these. Accordingly,
propaganda must seek to blame others, in the past few months, public sector
workers, their fat salaries, exorbitant pensions, and so on: all fantasy, on
the model of Reaganite imagery of black mothers being driven in their
limousines to pick up welfare checks - and other models that need not be
mentioned. We all must tighten our belts; almost all, that is.
Teachers are a particularly good target, as part of the deliberate effort to
destroy the public education system from kindergarten through the
universities by privatization - again, good for the wealthy, but a disaster
for the population, as well as the long-term health of the economy, but that
is one of the externalities that is put to the side insofar as market
principles prevail.
Another fine target, always, is immigrants.
That has been true throughout
U.S. history, even more so at times of economic crisis, exacerbated now by a
sense that our country is being taken away from us: the white population
will soon become a minority. One can understand the anger of aggrieved
individuals, but the cruelty of the policy is shocking.
Who are the immigrants targeted?
In Eastern Massachusetts, where I live, many are
Mayans fleeing genocide in the Guatemalan highlands carried out by Reagan's
favorite killers. Others are Mexican victims of Clinton's NAFTA, one of
those rare government agreements that managed to harm working people in all
three of the participating countries.
As NAFTA was rammed through Congress over
popular objection in 1994, Clinton also initiated the militarization of the
U.S.-Mexican border, previously fairly open. It was understood that Mexican
campesinos cannot compete with highly subsidized U.S. agribusiness, and that
Mexican businesses would not survive competition with U.S. multinationals,
which must be granted "national treatment" under the mislabeled free trade
agreements, a privilege granted only to corporate persons, not those of
flesh and blood.
Not surprisingly, these measures led to a flood
of desperate refugees, and to rising anti-immigrant hysteria by the victims
of state-corporate policies at home.
Much the same appears to be happening in Europe, where racism is probably
more rampant than in the U.S. One can only watch with wonder as Italy
complains about the flow of refugees from Libya, the scene of the first
post-World War I genocide, in the now-liberated East, at the hands of
Italy's Fascist government.
Or when France, still today the main protector
of the brutal dictatorships in its former colonies, manages to overlook its
hideous atrocities in Africa, while French President Nicolas Sarkozy warns
grimly of the "flood of immigrants" and Marine Le Pen objects that he is
doing nothing to prevent it.
I need not mention Belgium, which may win the
prize for what Adam Smith called,
"the savage injustice of the Europeans."
The rise of neo-fascist parties in much of Europe would be a frightening
phenomenon even if we were not to recall what happened on the continent in
the recent past.
Just imagine the reaction if Jews were being
expelled from France to misery and oppression, and then witness the
non-reaction when that is happening to Roma, also victims of the Holocaust
and Europe's most brutalized population.
-
In Hungary, the neo-fascist party Jobbik
gained 17% of the vote in national elections, perhaps unsurprising
when three-quarters of the population feels that they are worse off
than under Communist rule.
-
We might be relieved that in Austria the
ultra-right Jörg Haider won only 10% of the vote in 2008 - were it
not for the fact that the new Freedom Party, outflanking him from
the far right, won more than 17%. It is chilling to recall that, in
1928, the Nazis won less than 3% of the vote in Germany.
-
In England the British National Party
and the English Defence League, on the ultra-racist right, are major
forces. (What is happening in Holland you know all too well.)
-
In Germany, Thilo Sarrazin's lament that
immigrants are destroying the country was a runaway best-seller,
while Chancellor Angela Merkel, though condemning the book, declared
that multiculturalism had "utterly failed": the Turks imported to do
the dirty work in Germany are failing to become blond and blue-eyed,
true Aryans.
Those with a sense of irony may recall that
Benjamin Franklin, one of the leading figures of the Enlightenment, warned
that the newly liberated colonies should be wary of allowing Germans to
immigrate, because they were too swarthy; Swedes as well.
Into the twentieth
century, ludicrous myths of Anglo-Saxon purity were common in the U.S.,
including among presidents and other leading figures.
Racism in the literary culture has been a rank
obscenity; far worse in practice, needless to say. It is much easier to
eradicate polio than this horrifying plague, which regularly becomes more
virulent in times of economic distress.
I do not want to end without mentioning another externality that is
dismissed in market systems: the fate of the species.
Systemic risk in the financial system can be
remedied by the taxpayer, but no one will come to the rescue if the
environment is destroyed. That it must be destroyed is close to an
institutional imperative. Business leaders who are conducting propaganda
campaigns to convince the population that anthropogenic global warming is a
liberal hoax understand full well how grave is the threat, but they must
maximize short-term profit and market share. If they don't, someone else
will.
This vicious cycle could well turn out to be lethal. To see how grave the
danger is, simply have a look at the new Congress in the U.S., propelled
into power by business funding and propaganda. Almost all are climate
deniers. They have already begun to cut funding for measures that might
mitigate environmental catastrophe.
Worse, some are true believers; for example, the
new head of a subcommittee on the environment who explained that global
warming cannot be a problem because God promised Noah that there will not be
another flood.
If such things were happening in some small and remote country, we might
laugh. Not when they are happening in the richest and most powerful country
in the world.
And before we laugh, we might also bear in mind
that the current economic crisis is traceable in no small measure to the
fanatic faith in such dogmas as the efficient market hypothesis, and in
general to what Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, 15 years ago, called
the "religion" that markets know best - which prevented the central bank and
the economics profession from taking notice of an $8 trillion housing bubble
that had no basis at all in economic fundamentals, and that devastated the
economy when it burst.
All of this, and much more, can proceed as long as the Muashar doctrine
prevails.
As long as the general population is passive,
apathetic, diverted to consumerism or hatred of the vulnerable, then the
powerful can do as they please, and those who survive will be left to
contemplate the outcome.
