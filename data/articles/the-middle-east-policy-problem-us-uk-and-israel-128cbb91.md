One of the lesser known Zionist Israelis was
asked a question just prior to the 'Desert Storm' attack on Iraq in 1991.
He
was asked what the "Coalition" was going to do to Iraq. If you are not
familiar with the history, Iraq was at that time considered to be the 4th
strongest army in the world and was using its oil wealth to rapidly build
itself into an enlightened, advanced, modern European-style nation. How dare
the Iraqis use the oil wealth of their nation for the benefit of the Iraqi
people!
I wrote on this subject over two years ago as an email update and
it was posted on Rense.
"The main point: if you know the Neocons,
you will recognize their references. Luttwak, an Israeli citizen, said
'we' rather than 'the US is going to bomb them into the Stone Age'. Take
his comments in the context they were probably meant and you will know
where his allegiance lies."
That comment by Luttwak was in late 1990 or
early 1991 just before the US 'set up' Iraq and then attacked it in Desert
Storm. When asked that question Luttwak said "WE are going to bomb Iraq
into the Stone Age."
Well,
Israel was not in the Coalition in 'battle
gear.' They were in the Peanut Gallery urging on the slaughter/genocide of
the Iraqis because that is exactly what they wanted.
The following is exactly why Israel was pushing so hard for the US to
destroy Iraq. This is an excerpt from one of my most often requested email
updates, 'Enemies within Our Gates':
"If you refer back to the comment made by
hardliner Pro-Israel Neocon Edward Luttwak as to why Saddam must
be attacked (in 1991, not 2002), that Saddam was a threat to the Middle
East status quo and then compare to Baker's comment regarding Germany
being an enemy under "the war was actually only an economic preventive
measure" the picture should become a little clearer on what I am trying
to emphasize."
"'Saddam is not like the Saudi Princes who spend the bulk of their lives
outside of their country, and who fritter away the Kingdom's oil profits
on prostitutes and bottles of champagne in Paris. No, Saddam is building
railways! Creating electrical networks! Highways and other important
elements of a serious State infrastructure!
After eights years of war against the
Iranian regime of Khomeini, he desperately needs to demobilize his
Republican Guard, which incorporates so many of this technical elite, in
order to rebuild the war-devastated country. These people are his
technicians, his engineers. If they are put to work in the way Saddam
wishes, they will rapidly make Iraq the most advanced power in the
region, and we cannot allow this to happen.' "
Many people do not know who Edward Luttwak
is.
He is an Israeli citizen, a fierce Zionist Jew
and an advisor to OUR Pentagon on matters regarding how Israel wants US
policy to be implemented towards everyone in the Middle East, except Israel.
He is also the author of 'Coup d'etat, a
Practical Handbook'.
He is an arch Zionist Neocon plotter and the 'p-knuckleheads of PNAC'
consider him to be one of their most illustrious heroes. They based their
coup d'etat of America on his 'practical handbook.'
He ranks right up there with Zbigniew Brzezinski in coming up with
brain-damaged ideas that prove time and time again to be complete disasters
for the US in the area of Middle East foreign policy. I have looked at the
matter from every angle and in most instances the absolute, total backing of
Israel and cold shoulder to the other Arab nations in the region has proven
to be a complete disaster in US foreign policy.
Such foreign policy blunders are derived from the machinations behind the
scenes of Edward Luttwak and many others just like him who are myopic,
psychotic, and see only what is 'best for Israel' and to Hell with all
others. Lest you are wondering, that does include 'to Hell' with what is
best for the United States of America. And each and every one of YOU,
personally.
The Middle East is not 'just about the Jews.' The Middle East never has been
'just about the Jews' at any point in history until the current batch of
Zionist lunatics got into power there. For the last 60 years, they've been
building and exerting increasing undue, insidious, and often utterly
DOMINANT influence over US foreign and domestic policies through AIPAC,
the ADL and via the US Zionist media machine... which is, in a way,
the second 'government' of the United States.
This all adds up to the same stupid, deadly,
vile policies and decisions made over and over again by the counterfeit
'Congress' in DC.
The US is essentially owned by Zionism... from the London
Rothschilds to the deadly Zionist 'leaders'
in Israel to the AIPAC power brokers. America is Zionism's fat cash cow
which has been funding and fighting and killing for Zionism for over a
century now.
-
How much more will anti-Zionist Jews and
Americans take?
-
What do you SEE when you watch Bush,
McCain and Barky all groveling, wearing their skull
caps in Israel or before an AIPAC convention?
I have NEVER been anti-Jewish but I am decidedly
and definitely anti-Zionist. These people are beyond psychopathic.
What is 'best for Israel' is not, in fact, always best for the United
States, no matter now many pretzel twists, mental masturbations and
screaming gyrations and tantrums the Zionists pitch and whine about.
Who pushed for the annihilation of Iraq and the genocide of well over a
million human beings there? Israel and the George H W Bush Administration
and the current Bush Administration! Of course, do not forget the Iraq
Sanctions under the Clinton Administration which were was as cruel and
inhumane as any sanctions levied on any nation on Earth and resulted in the
deaths of close to ANOTHER million human beings.
Even machines to crush wheat into flour were not
allowed into Iraq under the bogus and nonsensical excuse that it was "dual
use technology" and Saddam 'might' make weaponized anthrax with it.
Insane...not possible. Starved the Iraqis to try to get them to rise up and
overthrow Saddam. It was nothing less than another American Genocide
directed by its Zionist masters.
Read on, you will learn WHY the US and UK wanted Saddam removed. It has
little to do with 'protecting Israel'.
That is just the excuse for the unspeakable.
-
Who is pushing for the destruction of
Iran? Israel and the Bush Administration and the UK.
-
What is the connection?
-
What is Iran doing? Oh my God, they are
building roads and rail and electrical generation plants and
universities and educating both their male and female populations to
new and unprecedented levels in their history. They are doing the
same 'evil' things Iraq was doing!
As a signatory to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Act they are exercising their legal rights to enrich
uranium and produce electricity! In fact, over 100 Non-Aligned nations have
now registered their unequivocal support of Iran's right to develop nuclear
technology.
Yes, as Luttwak said:
"they will rapidly make Iraq [sic IRAN] the
most advanced power in the region, and we cannot allow this to happen."
Who started this pissing match with Iran? The
Zionist-manipulated US and UK did many years ago, even before I was born.
"The Shah came to power during World War II
after an Anglo-Soviet invasion forced the abdication of his father, Reza
Shah. Mohammad Reza Shah's rule oversaw the nationalization of the
Iranian oil industry under the prime ministership of Mohammad Mossadegh."
"In 1953, the United States played a significant role in orchestrating
the overthrow of Iran's popular Prime Minister, Mohammed Massadegh. The
Eisenhower Administration believed its actions were justified for
strategic reasons; but the coup was clearly a setback for Iran's
political development. And it is easy to see now why many Iranians
continue to resent this intervention by America in their internal
affairs."
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi#cite_note-0%23cite_note-0
Ooh, that dastardly Mohammed! Mohammed
Mossadegh nationalized the Iranian oil and natural gas to keep his
nation from being plundered by the Zionist US and UK. That is the same thing
that 'evil wabbit Saddam Hussein' did and was building a real MODERN nation.
See the pattern?
Saddam would not let the US and UK come in and
take over Iraqi oil, just like someone over in Iran tried to do.
Folks, I am not saying Saddam was a saint, but he is no less evil than the
Shah of Iran that the U.S. installed into power, or the current gaggle of
clucking idiots in the Likudist Party of Israel and in London and DC.
Then, after the US handpicked replacement, Shah
Pahlavi was put into power (from Wiki):
'The Shah of Iran was the first Muslim
leader to recognize the State of Israel.'
Ah, yes, that makes him a good guy. He
recognized Israel in his role as the handpicked puppet of the US and UK. He
let the US and UK back at the oil and natural gas. He was a really good guy.
NOT! He was a murderous tyrant, handpicked by the US because he opened up
the oil and natural gas to the US and UK.
The US turned him into a military power and not a peep from Israel, because
he did as told and recognized Israel. The Shah let the US and UK have all
the oil and gas they wanted. He kept himself in power through political
intimidation, murder, imprisonment and incredible levels of torture of
anyone who disagreed with him.
Sound familiar?
When the Shah was deposed in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran went back to
controlling their own oil and gas and building their own nation. Oh, yeah,
you bet that pissed-off the Zionist overlords and US and UK something
terrible.
See the pattern? Get the picture as to what 'the real problem' is with Iran?
Iran intends to use Iranian oil and gas wealth for the benefit of Iranians.
So, yeah, they have to be destroyed just like the US and UK have done to
Iraq.
Saddam was not letting the US and UK come in and carve up Iraq oil for
themselves and leave little to nothing behind for Iraqis. That is what they
are still trying to do right now and the Iraqis are still not buying off on
it.
Iran rose up and cast off an evil tyrant, the handpicked puppet of the
Zionist-controlled US. They, too, took back control of their oil and gas in
1979 and intend to build the future for their own people with their own oil
and natural gas wealth.
Darn, that means the greedy folks in the UK and US will not get to
line their pockets with the wealth of Iranian oil and natural gas.
Yeah, that is plenty of reason to fabricate intelligence, lie, provoke,
kill, etc, so the US can make war plans and use the 'excuse' of defending
poor little Israel (the world's fourth or fifth ranking thermonuclear
monster) to get back in and plunder Iran oil and natural gas wealth.
Getting the picture, folks?
Rense has a video posted and I highly recommend you watch it. It is only
about 10 minutes long and is part of a speech by Scott Ritter, the UN
weapons inspector regarding Iraq. Ritter was right all along Iraq was no
threat to anyone... the 'problem' was that Saddam would not let the US and
UK have Iraq's oil. He 'selfishly' wanted it for his people.
Scott Ritter - The problem and the solution
I agree with Scott Ritter.
Americans are like little birds waiting for MSM
to feed them a news-byte 'worm' so they know what to think, whether that is
a lie or not.
Anything coming from DC virtually guarantees it is a lie.
Consider Scott Ritter's advice. Take control before we lose America forever.

There appear to be very few Americans (thanks to the controlled sunset
media) who realize and fully understand that our Planet has but one common
enemy, and that enemy is clearly Israel, as it is totally controlled by
criminal Zionism.
Religious freakazoids (John Hagee. et al) in this country believe that
Zionism is a religion historically antecedent to their own. A bumper sticker
I've frequently seen reads; "The Bible says it, I believe it and that
settles it." Education starved Americans have never heard of the
Protocols
of Zion, much less ever read it, but most of those few who have consider it
to be a hoax because their knowledge of history is close to zero, and
because Israel says it's a hoax.
The penultimate wet dream of Zionism is to
provoke a war between the US and
Russia. That can never happen. Have your essays translated into Russian and
offer them to the major Russian daily's. Make friends with Putin & Medvedev.
While possessing the knowledge and courage to write about this subject,
you've clearly established your bona fides if there was ever any doubt among
the broad corp. of Rense fans. As I'm sure you're well aware, you have to be
attracting the attention of some ruthless characters who comb the World
looking for trouble makers.
Please stay healthy and don't accept candy from
strangers.
