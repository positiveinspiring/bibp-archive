The brief descriptions of the major Elite
organizations, the Bilderbergs (BB),
Council on Foreign Relations (CFR),
and Trilateral Commission (TC),
were intended to be brief.
For more details, refer to my companion book,
The Elite Don't Dare Let Us Tell the People.
The fundamental differences between these three
Elite secret organizations are:
-
The BB members are largely from Western
Europe, Turkey, Greece, the Scandinavian countries, the US, and
Canada.
-
The CFR members were originally from the
New York City area, but later expanded to include Washington, DC,
and then the rest of the US.
-
The TC members come from all the same
above areas, but in this case the Japanese were included because of
their dominance of the banking industry. (The largest banks in the
world are in Japan.)
-
The BBs are the most secretive of the
three. When they meet, they clear out all the guests, and employees
in the buildings in which they are to meet, they completely debug
all the rooms, bring in their own cooks, waiters, housekeepers,
heavily armed security guards, etc., and do not allow "outsiders"
anywhere near the meeting place just before, during, and immediately
after they meet.
In Recent meetings, the security forces
were told to "shoot to kill", if anyone tried to get near, or to
break into their meetings. They claim that there are no written
records taken of their discussions, but "The American Free Press"
(formerly "The Spotlight") has occasionally acquired very detailed
documents that prove otherwise.
The attendees are required to maintain
complete and absolute secrecy regarding and after these
deliberations. Liberty Lobbys crack investigative reporters on "The
American Free Press" have positioned a mole within the BB that
somehow acquires a copy of the invitation list, and often a copy of
the agenda, but have never penetrated the actual meetings (to date).
Each time that they have met on US soil,
the meetings were held on
Rockefeller owned property.
The object of the formation of these
organizations is to enlist key political and economic leaders around the
world, in order to gain their assistance in dominating the entire world.
The other differences, and similarities are covered in the following brief
descriptions.
Bilderbergs (BB)
John J. McCloy (former Chairman of the
CFR, and Chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank) used his position as coordinator
of information for the US government to build the framework of what was to
become the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), created in
1941-1942 era, headed by Bill Donovan.
During 1947, the OSS was rolled into a new group
called the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by the 1947
National Security Act, which made the activities of the CIA immune from all
civil, and criminal laws.
In 1950 General Walter Bedel Smith became
Director of the CIA. The CIA helped organize, and sponsored the formation,
and operation of the Bilderberg Conferences.
There is little doubt that the CIA sponsored the
formation of the Bilderbergs, and continue to do so, to this day.
Kai Birds excellent account in "The Chairman, John J. McCoy, The
Making of the American Establishment", states:
"In late 1952, Retinger went to America to
try the idea out on his American contacts. Among others, he saw such old
friends as Averell Harriman, David Rockefeller, and Bedel Smith, then
director of the CIA. After Retinger explained his proposal, Smith said,
Why the hell didnt you come to me in the first place?
He quickly referred Retinger to C. D.
Jackson, who was about to become Eisenhowers special assistant for
psychological warfare. It took a while for Jackson to organize the
American wing of the group, but finally, in May 1954, the first
conference was held in the Hotel de Bilderberg, a secluded hotel in
Holland, near the German border.
Prince Bernhard, and Retinger drew up the
list of invitees from the European countries, while Jackson controlled
the American list."
Prince
Bernhard,
of The Netherlands, became the first Chairman, and served in
this post until scandal forced him to resign in 1974. Dr. Retinger became
the first Secretary, and remained so until his death.
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 300 Independence Ave., SE, Washington, DC 20003,
publishes a weekly newspaper titled "The American Free Press". At my
request, they sent me a reprint of a summary of Bilderberg information,
titled Spotlight on the Bilderbergers, Irresponsible Power, published
mid-June, 1975.
Page 6 of this document states:
"The Congressional Record - US Senate, April
11, 1964, states:
(Speaking) - Mr. (Jacob) Javits - Mr. President, the 13th in a series of
Bilderberg meetings on international affairs, in which I participated,
was held in Williamsburg, VA, on March 20, 21, and 22.
I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the
Record a background paper entitled The Bilderberg Meetings.
The Bilderberg Meetings
The idea of the Bilderberg meetings
originated in the early fifties.
Changes had taken place on the international
politician and economic scene after World War II. The countries of the
Western World felt the need for closer collaboration to protect their moral
and ethical values, their democratic institutions, and their independence
against the growing Communist threat. The Marshall plan and NATO were
examples of collective efforts of Western countries to join hands in
economic and military matters after World War II.
In the early 1950s, a number of people on both sides of the Atlantic sought
a means of bringing together leading citizens, not necessarily connected
with government, for informal discussions of problems facing the Atlantic
community. Such meetings, they felt, would create a better understanding of
the forces, and trends affecting Western nations, in particular. They
believed that direct exchanges could help to clear up differences, and
misunderstandings that might weaken the West.
One of the men who saw the need for such discussions was the late (Dr.)
Joseph H. (Heironymus) Retinger (as a matter of interest, the
name Heironymus is literally translated to be "MEMBER OF THE
OCCULT").
In 1952, he approached His Royal
Highness, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, with the suggestion of
informal and unofficial meetings to discuss the problems facing the Atlantic
community.
Others in Europe wholeheartedly supported the
idea, and proposals were submitted to American friends to join in the
undertaking. A number of Americans, including C.D. Jackson, the late
General Walter Bedel Smith, and the late
John Coleman, agreed to cooperate.
(Very reliable information from a former CIA
member now reveals that the CIA financed Dr. Retinger's efforts to convince
Prince Bernhard to form this group that was later to be called the
Bilderbergs. This is confirmed by the fact that General Walter Bedel Smith
was the CIA director from 1950 to 1953, so, is it surprising that he would
agree to join this group?)
The first meeting that brought Americans and Europeans together took place
under the chairmanship of Prince Bernhard at the Bilderberg Hotel in
Oosterbeek, Holland, from May 29 to May 31, 1954.
Ever since, the meetings have been called
Bilderberg meetings.
No Strict Rules of Procedure
From the outset, it was the intentions of the Bilderberg founders, and
participants that no strict rules of procedure govern the meetings. Every
effort was made to create a relaxed, informal atmosphere conducive to free,
and frank discussions.
Bilderberg is in no sense a policy-making body. No conclusions are reached.
There is no voting, and no resolutions are passed.
The meetings are off-the-record. Only the participants themselves may attend
the meetings.
Participants
It was obvious from the first that the success of the meetings would depend
primarily on the level of the participants.
Leading figures from many fields - industry,
labor, education, government, etc., are invited, who, through their special
knowledge or experience, can help to further Bilderberg objectives.
Representatives of governments attend in a personal, and not an official
capacity. An attempt is made to include participants representing many
political parties, and points of view. American participation has included
Members of Congress of both parties.
Over the years, Bilderberg participants have come from the NATO countries,
Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, and Finland, and have included prominent
individuals such as:
-
Dean Rusk
-
Christian A. Herter
-
Maurice Faure
-
Franz-Josef Strauss
-
Amitore Fanfani
-
Panayotis Pipinelis
-
Reginald Maudling
-
the late Hugh Gaitskell
-
Omer Becu
-
Guy Mollet
-
the late Michael Ross
-
Herman Abs
-
C. L. Sulzberger
-
Joseph Harsch
-
T. M. Terkelsen
Individuals with international responsibilities
have also participated, among them being
-
Gen. Alfred Gruenther
-
Lord Ismay
-
Eugene Black
-
Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer
-
Paul-Henry Spaak
-
the late Per Jacobsson
The Meetings
Bilderberg meetings are held at
irregular intervals, but have taken place once or twice a year since 1954.
All the early conferences were held in Europe,
but a meeting is now held on this side of the Atlantic every few years to
provide a convenient opportunity for American, and Canadian participants to
attend."
The Spotlight reports that the Bilderberg meetings are highly secret, and
are held at random times each year, and rarely at the same location, for
security reasons. The responsibility for security for these meetings is in
the hands of the government of the country in which the meetings are held.
They must supply military security, secret
service, national and local police, and private security personnel to
protect the privacy and safety of these very powerful international Elite
members who are not required to conform to regulations that private citizens
are subject-to, such as customs searches, visa requirements, or public
notice of their meetings. When they meet, no "outsiders" are allowed in or
near the building. They bring their own cooks, waiters, telephone operators,
housekeepers, and bodyguards.
The Bilderberg membership is made up of Kings, Queens, Princes, Chancellors,
Prime Ministers, Presidents, Ambassadors, Secretaries of State, Wall Street
investors, international bankers, news media executives, and wealthy
industrialist. Their meetings are by "invitation only", and no "outsiders"
in the news media are allowed, except by special invitation.
However, the news media are always present at
these meetings such as:
-
Peter Jennings (BB, Anchor & Senior
Editor of ABC News, World News Tonight)
-
Joseph C. Harsch (BB, CFR, former
Commentator for NBC, Inc.)
-
Bill D. Moyers (BB, Executive Director
of Public Affairs TV, Inc., former Director of the CFR)
-
William F. Buckley, Jr. (BB, CFR,
Editor-in-Chief of National Review, and host of PBSs Firing Line)
-
Gerald Piel (BB, CFR, former Chairman of
Scientific America, Inc.)
-
Henry Anatole Grunwald (BB, CFR, former
Editor-in-Chief of Time, Inc.)
-
Mortimer B. Zuckerman (BB, CFR, Chairman
& Editor-in-Chief of the US News, and World Report, New York Daily
News, and Atlantic Monthly)
-
Robert L. Bartley (BB, CFR, TC, Vice
President of the Wall Street Journal)
-
Peter Robert Kann (BB, CFR, Chairman &
CEO of Dow Jones & Company, and husband of Karen E. House, CFR)
-
William Kristol (BB, Editor & Publisher
of the new The Weekly Standard magazine)
-
Donald (Don) C. Cook (BB, CFR, former
European Diplomatic Correspondent for the Los Angeles Times)
-
Robert Leroy Bartley (BB, CFR, TC, Vice
President of the Wall Street Journal)
-
Albert J. Wohlstetter (BB, CFR, writer
for the Wall Street Journal)
-
Thomas L. Friedman (BB, CFR, TC,
Columnist for the New York Times)
-
the "Queen" of the Elite - (deceased)
Katharine Graham (BB, CFR, TC, Owner, and Chairwoman of the
Executive Committee of the Washington Post)
The 1998 meeting included Leslie Stahl, of CBS
60 Minutes. Even though the media moguls attend these secret meetings, they
do not file reports about the Elite Bilderberg activities during their
meetings.
The security measures taken by the Bilderberg Conferences are clearly
illustrated in an article appearing in The Spotlight, which stated:
EXCLUSIVE TO THE SPOTLIGHT
By James P. Tucker, Jr.
SPOTLIGHT, VOLUME 24, No. 14, Page 3, April,
1999
Bilderberg is scheduled to meet June 3-6
(1999) at the Caesar Park Penha Longa in Sintra, Portugal. Sintra is a
remote resort, about 40 miles from Lisbon. Information about the secret
meeting was provided by an agent inside Bilderberg.
Of all the media in the world, only THE SPOTLIGHT, has tracked the
Bilderbergers every year and reported on their secret meeting where
vital questions and issues are decided which effect every person in the
world. American and European financiers, manufacturers, media moguls and
politicians meet at remote luxury resorts, allow only "loyal staff" to
remain on the job, empty the establishment of all others, employ
platoons of police, military and their own private security to seal
themselves off. They have tried to keep the meetings secret for 45
years.
But this year following extensive SPOTLIGHT-generated publicity last
year in Scotland, and earlier in Germany, Scandinavia, Georgia, and
Canada, Bilderberg is taking more extreme steps, its agent confided.
Instead of closing down the Penha Longa to all outsiders one day before
the meeting starts on June 2, Bilderberg has ordered the resort shut
down a full 48 hours before the internationalist confab.
In addition, Bilderberg will pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to
reimburse the Portuguese government for deploying military forces to
guard their privacy and for helicopters to seek out intruders.
All Bilderberg participants, their staff members and resort employees
will wear photo identification tags that look much like state drivers'
licenses. They will have separate colors to identify the wearer as a
participant, staff, or employee. A computer chip "fingerprint" will
assure the identity of the card's wearer. Any intruders are to
manhandled-cuffed, jailed, or if resisting or fleeing, shot, the agent
said.
Bilderbergers are greatly disturbed over the growing public knowledge of
their control of the world and of resistance to their schemes for a
global government as nationalism grows around the world.
Bilderberg was instrumental in tearing down Jean-Marie Le Pen, who
founded France's National Front. The French-first party has stunned the
Establishment by regularly capturing 15 percent of the vote in that
nation.
Expecting recession, Bilderberg feared Le Pen and "nationalists" from
other countries would interfere with their "free trade" goals as they
fight to protect their domestic industries from exploitation by the
global cabal.
Because Bilderberg shares common goals with the Trilateral Commission,
the agenda that emerged in Washington (SPOTLIGHT, March 29, 1999) will
be major topics in Portugal, too.
This includes a "Globalization summit" called for by Peter D.
Sutherland, head of Goldman Sachs International. Sutherland attended the
Bilderberg meeting in Scotland last May and is expected in Portugal.
Sutherland is expected to again call for "Supranational institutions to
manage the global economy while denouncing nations that "cling
tenaciously to their separate identities" while calling for "sharing
sovereignty"
In a related topic, there could be renewed calls for the UN to be able
to directly tax all people. In the past, Bilderberg has proposed a UN
levy on International travel and on the oil at the wellhead, so all who
travel or drive will be taxed.

Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)
Lets start with the smoke and mirrors furnished
by the CFR in several of their Annual Reports. Then we will provide the
other-side-of-the-coin, as observed by quite a number of independent
researchers, and writers.
The CFRs Annual Report for July 1, 1993-June 30, 1994, page 4,
states:
"The Council on Foreign Relations is a
nonprofit, and nonpartisan membership organization dedicated to
improving the understanding of US foreign policy, and international
affairs through the exchange of ideas.
The Council was founded in 1921 shortly after the end of World War I.
Several of the American participants in the Paris Peace Conference
decided that it was time for more private American citizens to become
familiar with the increasing international responsibilities, and
obligations of the United States.
This decision led to the creation of an
organization dedicated to the continuous study of US foreign policy for
the benefit of both its members, and a wider audience of interested
Americans."
Now, the other side of the coin.
The New World Order, by Pat Robertson, 1991, page 66-67,
states:
"This august body of wise men has
effectively dominated the making of foreign policy by the United States
government since before World War II. The CFR has included virtually
every key national security, and foreign policy adviser of this nation
for the past seventy years."
"In government policy, the most visible expression of the Establishment
is the
Council on Foreign Relations, and its
publication, Foreign Affairs. Out of some twenty-nine hundred
members, at least five hundred are very powerful, another five hundred
are from centers of influence, and the rest are influential in academia,
the media, business, and finance, the military, or government. A few are
token conservatives."
Page 96
"According to a man who had been a member for fifteen years, Rear
Admiral Chester Ward, former judge advocate general of the navy
from 1956 to 1960.
This purpose of promoting disarmament,
and submergence of US sovereignty, and national independence into an
all-powerful one-world government is the only objective revealed to
about 95 percent of 1,551 members [in 1975]. There are two other
ulterior purposes the CFR influence is being used to promote; but it
is improbable that they are known to more than 75 members, or that
these purposes ever have even been identified in writing.
The goals of the Establishment are somewhat
strange, and we will discuss them in detail.
At the central core is a belief in the
superiority of their own skill to form a world system in which
enlightened monopolistic capitalism can bring all of the diverse
currencies, banking systems, credit, manufacturing, and raw materials
into one government-supervised whole, policed of course by their own
world army." (Could this be the army of
the United Nations?)
Page 97
CFR membership is made up of present, and past
-
Presidents
-
Ambassadors
-

-
Wall Street investors
-
international bankers
-
foundation executives
-
Think Tank executives
-
lobbyist lawyers
-
NATO, and Pentagon military leaders
-
wealthy industrialist
-
media owners, and executives
-

professors
-
select Senators, and Congressmen
-

-
wealthy entrepreneurs
They hold regular secret meetings including
members, and very select guests. Occasionally they will hold a public
meeting, and invite the open press (including C-SPAN), in order to give the
impression that they are a harmless group engaged only in social activities.
A number of people, when hearing about the CFR ask,
"If you say that the CFR is such a secret
organization, why is it that we can get a copy of their annual report,
which contains a list of their members? Why should I believe you when
you say that they are a secret organization?"
Websters New Collegiate Dictionary,
states that the definition of attribute is,
"To ascribe by way of cause, inherent
quality, interpretation, authorship, or classification..."
The literal translation is,
"You had better not tell the outsiders what
we do, or say".
The answer then comes from their own document,
the Council on Foreign Relations 1992 Annual Report, where they
emphatically state, in 20 different places, and in varying terms, that
members better not tell:
"At all meetings, the Councils rule of
non-attribution applies. This assures participants that they may speak
openly without others later attributing their statements to them in
public media or forums, or knowingly transmitting them to persons who
will."
Page 21
"Like the Council, the Committees encourage candid discourse by holding
their meetings on a not-for-attribution basis".
Page 122
Article II of the by-laws states: "It is an express condition of
membership in the Council, to which condition every member accedes by
virtue of his or her membership, that members will observe such rules,
and regulations as may be prescribed from time to time by the Board of
Directors concerning the conduct of Council meetings or the attribution
of statements made therein, and that any disclosure, public, or other
action by a member in contravention thereof may be regarded by the Board
of Directors in its sole discretion as grounds for termination or
suspension of membership pursuant to Article I of the by-laws."
Page 169
"Full freedom of expression is encouraged at Council meetings.
Participants are assured that they may speak openly, as it is the
tradition of the Council that others will not attribute or characterize
their statements in public media or forums or knowingly transmit them to
persons who will. All participants are expected to honor that
commitment."
Page 174
"It would not be in compliance with the reformulated Rule, however, for
any meeting participant:
-
to publish a speakers statement in
attributed form in a newspaper;
-
to repeat it on television or radio,
or on a speakers platform, or in a classroom; or
-
to go beyond a memo of limited
circulation, by distributing the attributed statement in a
company or government agency newspaper.
The language of the Rule also goes out of
its way to make it clear that a meeting participant is forbidden
knowingly to transmit the attributed statement to a newspaper reporter
or other such person who is likely to publish it in a public medium.
The essence of the Rule as reformulated is
simple enough: participants in Council meetings should not pass along an
attributed statement in circumstances where there is substantial risk
that it will promptly be widely circulated or published."
Page 175
... "In order to encourage to the fullest a free, frank, and open
exchange of ideas in Council meetings, the Board of Directors has
prescribed, in addition to the Non-Attribution Rule, the following
guidelines. All participants in Council meetings are expected to be
familiar with, and adhere to these Guidelines. ..."
"Members bringing guests should complete a "guest notice card", and
acquaint their guests with the Councils Non-Attribution Rule governing
what is said at meetings."
Page 176
"As a condition of use, the officers of the Council shall require each
user of Council records to execute a prior written commitment that he
will not directly or indirectly attribute to any living person any
assertion of fact or opinion based upon any Council record without first
obtaining from such person his written consent thereto."
In "A letter from the Chairman" in the 1994
Annual Report for the CFR, Peter G. Peterson states on page 7,
that:
"... Members had occasion to meet in
intensive off-the-record sessions with Secretary of State [Warren]
Christopher, National Security Advisor [Anthony] Lake, Secretary [of
State emeritus, George Pratt] Shultz, Ambassador [Mickey] Kantor, Under
Secretary of the Treasury [Lawrence H.] Summers, the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, and other ranking officials.
Next on our agenda are plans for reaching
out to congressional leaders as well, an opportunity we will fashion as
one component of an enhanced Washington Program."
The CFRs 1999 Annual Report, page 5,
states their three goals:
-
Add value by improving understanding of
world affairs and by providing new ideas for US foreign policy.
-
Transform the Council into a truly
national organization to benefit from the expertise and experience
of leaders nationwide.
-
Find and nurture the next generation of
foreign policy leaders and thinkers.
These are "THEIR" words, not mine. I am simply
reporting these facts to you.
If this is not a secret organization, then why
would they be so emphatic, and state in 20 different ways that
non-attribution (or you better not tell) was so important, in their very own
annual report? In addition, if you are proud of what you say, and do, then
you dont care whether it becomes public knowledge, or not.
The other side of this coin is: if you are doing
something illegal, immoral, unethical, unpopular, and/or unconstitutional,
you will do whatever is necessary to see that it is kept secret.
In his book, "The ANGLO-AMERICAN ESTABLISHMENT", Dr. Carroll Quigley
writes,
"One wintry afternoon in February 1891,
three men were engaged in earnest conversation in London. From that
conversation were to flow consequences of the greatest importance to the
British Empire, and to the world as a whole. For these men were
organizing a secret society that was, for more than fifty years, to be
one of the most important forces in the formulation, and execution of
British imperial and foreign policy.
The three men who were thus engaged were already well known in England.
The leader was Cecil Rhodes, fabulously wealthy empire builder,
and the most important person in South Africa. The second was William
T. Stead, the famous, and probably also the most sensational,
journalist of the day. The third was Reginald Baliol Brett, later
known as Lord Esher, friend, and confidant of Queen Victoria, and later
to be the most influential advisor of King Edward VII, and King George
V.
The details of this important conversation will be examined later. At
present we need only point out that the three drew up a plan of
organization for their secret society, and a list of original members.
The plan for organization provided for an inner circle, to be known as
"The Society of the Elect", and an outer circle, to be known as 'The
Association of Helpers'.
Within The Society of the Elect, the
real power was to be exercised by the leader, and a 'Junta of Three'.
The leader was to be Rhodes, and the Junta was to be Stead, Brett, and
Alfred Milner. In accordance with this decision, Milner was added to the
society by Stead shortly after the meeting we have described."
- Quigley, Carroll (1910-1977)
The Anglo-American Establishment, From
Rhodes to Cliveden, 1981, pg. 3
Of the
Secret Societies goals, and methods of
operation Quigley writes,
"The goals which Rhodes, and Milner sought,
and the methods by which they hoped to achieve them were so similar by
1902 that the two are almost indistinguishable. Both sought to unite the
world, and above all the English-speaking world, in a federal structure
around Britain.
Both felt that this goal could best be
achieved by a secret band of men united to one another by devotion to
the common cause, and by personal loyalty to one another.
Both felt that this band should pursue its
goal by secret political, and economic influence behind the scenes, and
by the control of journalistic, educational, and propaganda agencies...
- "
Quigley, Carroll (1910-1977)
The Anglo-American Establishment, From
Rhodes to Cliveden, 1981, pg. 49
Between 1910-1915 the Secret Society
evolved into an international group of coconspirators called
Round Table Groups that were established in
seven nations:
-
Britain
-
South Africa
-
Canada
-
New Zealand
-
Australia
-
India
-
United States
(The British Round Table was actually created
in England in Feb. 5, 1891. In the US it is called the
Council on foreign Relations, in England it is the
Royal Institute for International Affairs, in Canada the Canadian
Institute of International Affairs, in Chile it is the Chilean Council on
Foreign Relations, and so on.)
In 1920 the Secret Society evolved into the Institutes for International
Affairs, and the Council on Foreign Relations. Many of the founding fathers
belonged to America's first intelligence agency the INQUIRY.
The CFR could not accomplish their goals without complicity of the
mainstream news media, which they absolutely control with an iron fist. They
do this using psychological operations (PSYOPS).
The RAND Corp.
is one of the chief users of this technique.
This is clearly explained by the following
Internet message:
"Not many people have heard of the Council
on Foreign Relations (CFR) or know how they operate. This is not an
accident, the group has purposely maintained a low profile. The CFR is a
branch of an international group of coconspirators called the Round
Table Group. This group has been controlling public opinion throughout
the world for over 100 years.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff have defined psychological operations (PSYOPS)
as those that:
"include psychological warfare, and, in
addition, encompass those political, military, economic, and
ideological actions planned, and conducted to create in neutral or
friendly foreign groups the emotions, attitudes, or behavior to
support achievement of national objectives."
Another proposal,
"develops the concept of 'strategic
psychological operations' as aimed at influencing, and shaping
decision-makers' power to govern, or control their followers."
The American people, are among the groups
being targeted, and controlled.
"Tactics of Deception" are formalized psychological warfare techniques.
"Tactics of Deception" build a psychological environment that differs
from the material environment. "Tactics of deception" are used to create
false reality worlds. In terms of perceptual psychology, "Tactics of
Deception" provoke illusory precepts. To influence behavior the
deception must follow three basic rules.
First, the deception must be "reasonable";
second there must be no simple way of checking the facts in the case;
and third the use of deception should not discredit a source which may
have valuable future potential.
One way to stop this group is to expose them, and their techniques to
the people they are manipulating. One "Tactic of Deception" used to
achieve Council on Foreign Relations aims, is to place Council members
on both sides of an issue. Another "Tactic of Deception" is to use CFR
control of the legal, legislative, and court systems to create the
perception that laws are being followed when in fact, Lawyers,
Legislators, and Justices are committing blatant illegalities to further
CFR aims.
A third "Tactic of Deception" is simply to
lie."
http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2807
Another excellent example of deception and cover
up is the book, "The Kennedy Tapes".
Two CFR members, Ernest R. May and
Philip D. Zelikow, supposedly listened to all of President John F.
Kennedy audio tapes and wrote this book quoting all of the interesting facts
so as to assure the public that there were no other important statements
made on these tapes that the public would care to know about.
There were to motives involved here:
(1) to print only what the Elite wanted
printed about the JFK assassination
(2) to throw any other potential
researchers off the trail
This was a very grueling task of listening to
hundreds of hours of taped conversations.
Therefore, other researchers should just "take
their word" that they had printed all of the interesting facts from these
tapes. I suspect that two non-CFR researchers would have written an entirely
different book.
Historian Michael Beschloss listened to the White House tapes
transcribed by Lyndon Johnson during his time in office, and wrote a book,
"Taking Charge: The Johnson White House Tapes, 1963-1964".
Is it not strange that this author is also a
member of the Council on Foreign Relations?
As Peter Grose stated in his Council on Foreign Relations Book,
Continuing the Inquiry (1996) on page 5:
"They (the British) proposed a permanent
Anglo-American Institute of International Affairs, with one branch in
London, the other in New York."
The headquarters for the CFR is:
The Harold Pratt House located at 58 East
68th Street
New York City, New York 10021
Oddly enough, this building is located just
across the street from the Russian (former Soviet) Embassy.
Trilateral Commission (TC)
In 1973,
David Rockefeller asked
Zbigniew Brzezinski to put together an organization of the
top political, and business leaders from around the World.
He called this group the Trilateral
Commission (TC).
According to an information sheet supplied to me by the TC, dated March 23,
1994:
"The European Community, North America (US
and Canada), and Japan - the three main democratic industrialized areas
of the world - are the three sides of the Trilateral Commission. The
Commissions members are about 325 distinguished citizens, with a
variety of leadership responsibilities, from these three regions.
When the first triennium of the Trilateral
Commission was launched in 1973, the most immediate purpose was to draw
together - at a time of considerable friction among governments - the
highest level unofficial group possible to look together at the common
problems facing our three areas.
At a deeper level, there was a sense that
the United States was no longer in such a singular leadership position
as it had been in earlier post-World War II years, and that a more
shared form of leadership - including Europe, and Japan in particular -
would be needed for the international system to navigate successfully
the major challenges of the coming years.
These purposes continue to inform the
Commissions work.
The rise of Japan, and progress of the European Community over the past
twenty years - particularly in the world economy - have validated the
vision of the Commissions founders. At the same time, the end of the
Cold War calls for a fresh vision of what this outward-looking
partnership can accomplish in the coming years. The opportunities are
remarkable, and yet, with the welcome end of the old Soviet threat, part
of the glue holding our regions together has dissolved. Helping meet
that leadership challenge is at the heart of the Trilateral Commission
effort.
The full Commission gathers once each year - in Lisbon in 1992, in
Washington in 1993, in Tokyo in 1994."
(In Copenhagen, Denmark in 1995.)
The above are their words. Below are words of
those who see this group in a different light.
The New World Order, by Pat Robertson, 1991, Page 102, states:
"In 1970 a young Polish intellectual named
Zbigniew Brzezinski foresaw the rising economic power of
Japan, and postwar Europe. Brzezinski idealized the theories of Karl
Marx. In his book,
Between Two Ages, as in
subsequent writings, he argued that balance-of-power politics was out,
and world-order politics was in.
The initial world order was to be a
trilateral economic linkage between Japan, Europe, and the United
States. David Rockefeller funded Brzezinski, and called together an
organization, named the Trilateral Commission, with
Brzezinski as its first executive secretary, and director.
The stated goals of the Trilateral Commission are:
'Close Trilateral cooperation in keeping
the peace, in managing the world economy, in fostering economic
redevelopment, and alleviating world poverty will improve the
chances of a smooth, and peaceful evolution of the global system.'"
The Shadows of Power, by James Perloff,
1988, pages 154-156, states:
"How did the TC begin?
The Trilateral Commission, wrote
Christopher Lydon in the July 1977 Atlantic, was David
Rockefellers brainchild. George Franklin, North American secretary
of the Trilateral Commission, stated that it was entirely David
Rockefellers idea originally.
Helping the CFR chairman develop the concept
was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who laid the first stone in
Foreign Affairs in 1970:
A new, and bolder approach is needed -
creation of a community of the developed nations which can
effectively address itself to the larger concerns confronting
mankind. In addition to the United States, and Western Europe, Japan
ought to be included ... A council representing the United States,
Western Europe, and Japan, with regular meetings of the heads of
governments as well as some small standing machinery, would be a
good start.
That same year, Brzezinski elaborated these
thoughts in his book
Between Two Ages. It
shows Brzezinski to be a classic
CFR man - a globalist more than lenient toward Communism.
He declared that,
National sovereignty is no longer a
viable concept, and that Marxism represents a further vital, and
creative stage in the maturing of mans universal vision. Marxism is
simultaneously a victory of the external, active man over the inner,
passive man, and a victory of reason over belief...
The Trilateral Commission was
formally established in 1973, and consisted of leaders in business,
banking, government, and mass media from North America, Western Europe,
and Japan.
David Rockefeller was founding chairman, and
Brzezinski founding director of the North American branch, most of whose
members were also in the CFR.
In the Wall Street Journal, David Rockefeller explained that,
the Trilateral Commission is, in
reality, a group of concerned citizens interested in fostering
greater understanding, and cooperation among international allies.
But, it was not all so innocent according to
Jeremiah Novak, who wrote in the Atlantic (July 1977):
The Trilateralists emphasis on
international economics is not entirely disinterested, for the oil
crisis forced many developing nations, with doubtful repayment
abilities, to borrow excessively. All told, private multinational
banks, particularly Rockefellers Chase Manhattan, have loaned
nearly $52 billion to developing countries.
An overhauled IMF would provide another
source of credit for these nations, and would take the big private
banks off the hook. This proposal is the cornerstone of the
Trilateral plan.
Senator Barry Goldwater put it less mercifully. In his book With
No Apologies, he termed the Commission,
David Rockefellers newest
international cabal, and said, It is intended to be the
vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial, and
banking interests by seizing control of the political government
of the United States.
Zbigniew Brzezinski showed how serious
TC ambitions were in the July 1973 Foreign Affairs, stating that,
without closer
American-European-Japanese cooperation the major problems of
today cannot be effectively tackled, and... the active promotion
of such trilateral cooperation must now become the central
priority of US policy.
The best way to effect this would be for a
Trilateralist to soon become President. One did (Jimmy Carter)...
In 1973, Carter dined with the CFR chairman
(David Rockefeller) at the latters Tarrytown, New York estate. Present
was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was helping Rockefeller screen prospects
for the Trilateral Commission.
Brzezinski later told Peter Pringle
of the London Sunday Times that,
we were impressed that Carter had
opened up trade offices for the state of Georgia in Brussels, and
Tokyo. That seemed to fit perfectly into the concept of the
Trilateral.
Carter became a founding member of the
(Trilateral) Commission - and his destiny became calculable.
Senator Barry Goldwater wrote:
David Rockefeller and Zbigniew
Brzezinski found Jimmy Carter to be their ideal candidate. They
helped him win the nomination, and the presidency.
To accomplish this purpose, they
mobilized the money power of the Wall Street bankers, the
intellectual influence of the academic community - which is
subservient to the wealth of the great tax-free foundations - and
the media controllers represented in the membership of the CFR, and
the Trilateral.
Seven months before the Democratic
nominating convention, the Gallup Poll found less than four percent of
Democrats favoring Jimmy Carter for President.
But, almost overnight - like Willkie, and
Eisenhower before him - he became the candidate."
This is probably one of the very best
illustrations of the great power of the Elite.
They can make or break any president or
candidate for president. They made Jimmy Carter in his efforts to
become president, and broke Senator Barry Goldwater in his failed
attempt.
The TC membership is made up of present, and past,
-
Presidents
-
Ambassadors
-
Secretaries of State
-
Wall Street investors
-
international bankers
-
foundation executives
-
Think Tank executives
-
lobbyist lawyers
-
NATO, and Pentagon military leaders
-
wealthy industrialist
-
media owners, and executives
-
university presidents, and key
professors
-
select Senators, and Congressmen
-
wealthy entrepreneurs
They hold annual secret meetings including only
members, and very select guests.
"The Trilateral Commission doesn't run the
world, the Council on Foreign Relations does that!"
by Winston Lord

State Department.

Level of Involvement by Elite Members
Do I think that everyone who belongs to one of these secret organizations is
EVIL? Absolutely NOT.
If you look at the Elite as though they were an archery target, then:
-
Center or Bulls Eye - Is made up
of the Czar and the members of the Inner Circle. They are the
decision makers and are therefore 100% informed and involved in the
Global Union movement.
David Rockefeller is the only
"obvious" member of this group. We can speculate about the members
of the Inner Circle, but we will probably never have these
speculations confirmed.
-
Inner Ring - This group is made
up of the Officers & Directors and triple members of all three Elite
groups. They are probably 90% informed by the Czar and the members
of the Inner Circle, and are heavily involved in the Global Union
movement (see the preceding listing and following charts for these
members.)
-
Center Ring - This group is made
up of the leaders, implementers and double members of the three
Elite Groups, and who are probably 80% informed by the Czar and the
members of the Inner Circle, and are moderately involved in the
Global Union movement.
-
Outer Ring - These members are
included for camouflage purposes only, and are made up of many of
those who belong to only the CFR. These members are aware of only
about 50% or less of the goals and objectives of the Global Union
movement. A large number of these people are members for ego and
social reasons only, and would very likely resign immediately, when
they find out what the Global Union is "really" up to.
An example is Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.,
the Hollywood actor, who probably falls completely off the above
target. He would be classified as true camouflage. Another example
of another possible member of the Outer Ring is Ben J. Wattenberg.
He would be in the Outer Ring if he told
the absolute truth on C-SPAN, with Bryan Lamb, on August 29, 1995,
when he stated,
-
"I plead guilty to being a member of
the CFR, and I only pay my dues, but never, or rarely attends
their meetings."
If he was truthful, I would place him in
the Outer Ring. On the other hand, the CFR's bylaws absolutely
prohibit their members from discussing this Elite organization.
For this reason, he could have just been
complying with their bylaws, and in all reality, he may be a very
active member, and really belongs in one of the inner rings.
