Enormous Corruption Scandal

In many other
countries, excluding the United States, corrupt bankers are
often brought to task by their respective governments.
The most recent
example of a corrupt banker being held accountable comes out of
Spain, where the former head of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF),
Rodrigo Rato (above image), was sentenced to four
years and six months behind bars.
According to
the
AFP, Spain's National Court, which deals with corruption and
financial crime cases, said he had been found guilty of
embezzlement when he headed up Caja Madrid and Bankia, at a time
when both groups were having difficulties.
Rato, who is
tied to a slew of other allegations, was convicted and sentenced
for misusing 12m between 2003 and 2012 - sometimes splashing
out at the height of Spain's economic crisis, according to the AFP.
The people of
Spain were outraged over the scandal as it was discovered during
the height of a severe financial crisis in which banks were
receiving millions in taxpayer dollars.
Bankia was eventually
nationalized and given 22 billion in public money.
Although he was
sentenced, Rato, who is also a former Spanish economy minister,
remains free pending a possible appeal because of his highly
connected elite status.
Rato was
brought down in a massive effort by Spain to get rid of
corruption within the banking system. The problem had gotten so
bad that Spain decided to clean house and 65 people, including
Rato, were brought to task.
According to
the AP, they were accused of having paid for personal expenses
with credit cards put at their disposal by both
Caja Madrid and
Bankia, without ever justifying them or declaring them to tax
authorities.
These expenses included,
-
petrol for their cars
-
supermarket shopping
-
holidays
-
luxury bags
-
parties in
nightclubs
According to
the indictment, Rato maintained the "corrupt system" established
by his predecessor Miguel Blesa when he took the reins of
Caja
Madrid in 2010, reports the
AFP.
He then replicated the system when he took charge of Bankia, a group born in 2011 out of the merger of Caja Madrid
with six other savings banks, prosecutors said.
According to
the report:
Rato was
economy minister and deputy prime minister in the
conservative government of Jose Maria Aznar from 1996 to
2004, before going on to head up the IMF until 2007.
His
subsequent career as a banker was short-lived - from 2010 to
2012 - but apart from the credit cards case, it also led to
another banking scandal considered the country's biggest
ever.
Thousands
of small-scale investors lost their money after they were
persuaded to convert their savings to shares ahead of the
flotation of Bankia in 2011, with Rato at the reins.
Less
than a year later, he resigned as it became known that Bankia was in dire straits.
The state
injected billions of Euros but faced with the scale of
Bankia's losses and trouble at other banks, it asked the EU
for a bailout for the banking sector and eventually received
41bn.
Rato and
others were probed, accused of misleading small investors in
the listing of Bankia, which has since paid out 1.2bn in
compensation.
To highlight
the utter corruption within the banking cartel that is the IMF,
Rato is the third former chief to be ousted for illegal
activity.
For those who
don't remember, Rato's successor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn,
was
tried in 2015 on pimping charges in a lurid sex scandal.
Naturally, he was
acquitted - in spite of the fact that he
admitted to engaging in illicit sex with prostitutes at a series
of orgies that supposedly took place at the Hotel Carlton in the
northern French city of Lille.
The court sided with DSK and
agreed that he had no idea the women he repeatedly filled the
orgies with were being paid.
Christine
Lagarde, who took over from Strauss-Kahn and is the current IMF
chief, was found guilty in December of "negligence" for
approving a massive government payout to business tycoon Bernard Tapie during her tenure as French finance minister.
Despite being
found guilty of corruption, Lagarde was not sentenced to a
single day in jail.
She has since been meeting with Trump's
Goldman Sachs-connected Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin,
noting that they've had,
"some very
positive discussions..."
