# The Prison State of America

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_americanempire42.htm

Prisons employ and exploit the ideal worker.
Prisoners do not receive benefits or pensions.
They are not paid overtime. They are forbidden to
organize and strike. They must show up on time. They are not paid
for sick days or granted vacations. They cannot formally complain
about working conditions or safety hazards.
If they are disobedient, or attempt to protest their
pitiful wages, they lose their jobs and can be sent to isolation
cells.
The roughly 1 million prisoners who work for
corporations and government industries in the
American prison system are models for what the corporate state
expects us all to become. And corporations have no intention of
permitting prison reforms that would reduce the size of their bonded
workforce.
In fact, they are seeking to replicate these
conditions throughout the society.
States, in the name of austerity, have stopped
providing prisoners with essential items including shoes, extra
blankets and even toilet paper, while starting to charge them for
electricity and room and board.
Most prisoners and the families that struggle to
support them are chronically short of money. Prisons are company
towns. Scrip, rather than money, was once paid to coal miners, and
it could be used only at the company store.
Prisoners are in a similar condition. When they go
broke - and being broke is a frequent occurrence in prison -
prisoners must take out prison loans to pay for medications, legal
and medical fees and basic commissary items such as soap and
deodorant. Debt peonage inside prison is as prevalent as it is
outside prison.
States impose an array of fees on prisoners.
For example, there is a 10 percent charge imposed by
New Jersey on every commissary purchase. Stamps have a 10 percent
surcharge. Prisoners must pay the state for a 15-minute deathbed
visit to an immediate family member or a 15-minute visit to a
funeral home to view the deceased.
New Jersey, like most other states, forces a prisoner
to reimburse the system for overtime wages paid to the two guards
who accompany him or her, plus mileage cost. The charge can be as
high as $945.04. It can take years to pay off a visit with a dying
father or mother.
Fines, often in the thousands of dollars, are
assessed against many prisoners when they are sentenced.
There are 22 fines that can be imposed in New Jersey,
including,
-
the Violent Crime Compensation Assessment (VCCB)
-
the Law Enforcement Officers Training &
Equipment Fund (LEOT)
-
Extradition Costs (EXTRA)
The state takes a percentage each month out of prison
pay to pay down the fines, a process that can take decades.
If a prisoner who is fined $10,000 at sentencing must
rely solely on a prison salary he or she will owe about $4,000 after
making payments for 25 years.
Prisoners can leave prison in debt to the state. And
if they cannot continue to make regular payments - difficult because
of high unemployment - they are sent back to prison. High recidivism
is part of the design.
Corporations have privatized most of the prison
functions once handled by governments. They run prison commissaries
and, since the prisoners have nowhere else to shop, often jack up
prices by as much as 100 percent.
Corporations have taken over the phone systems and
charge exorbitant fees to prisoners and their families. They grossly
overcharge for money transfers from families to prisoners. And these
corporations, some of the nation's largest, pay little more than a
dollar a day to prison laborers who work in for-profit prison
industries.
Food and merchandise vendors, construction companies,
laundry services, uniforms companies, prison equipment vendors,
cafeteria services, manufacturers of pepper spray, body armor and
the array of medieval instruments used for the physical control of
prisoners, and a host of other contractors feed like jackals off
prisons.
Prisons, in America, are a hugely profitable
business.
Our prison-industrial complex, which holds 2.3
million prisoners, or 25 percent of the world's prison population,
makes money by keeping prisons full.
It demands bodies, regardless of color, gender or
ethnicity. As the system drains the pool of black bodies, it has
begun to incarcerate others. Women - the fastest-growing segment of
the prison population - are swelling prisons, as are poor whites in
general, Hispanics and immigrants.
Prisons are no longer a black-white issue. Prisons
are a grotesque manifestation of corporate capitalism. Slavery is
legal in prisons under the 13th Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution.
It reads:
"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,
except as punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been
duly convicted, shall exist within the United States
"
And the massive U.S. prison industry functions like
the forced labor camps that have existed in all totalitarian
states.
Corporate investors, who have poured billions into
the business of mass incarceration, expect long-term returns. And
they will get them. It is their lobbyists who write the draconian
laws that demand absurdly long sentences, deny paroles, determine
immigrant detention laws and impose minimum-sentence and
three-strikes-out laws (mandating life sentences after three felony
convictions).
The politicians and the courts, subservient to
corporate power, can be counted on to protect corporate interests.
Corrections Corporation of America (CCA),
the largest owner of for-profit prisons and immigration detention
facilities in the country, had revenues of $1.7 billion in 2013 and
profits of $300 million. CCA holds an average of 81,384 inmates in
its facilities on any one day.
Aramark Holdings Corp., a Philadelphia-based company
that contracts through Aramark Correctional Services to provide food
to 600 correctional institutions across the United States, was
acquired in 2007 for $8.3 billion by investors that included Goldman
Sachs.
The three top for-profit prison corporations
spent an estimated $45 million over a recent 10-year period for
lobbying that is keeping the prison business flush.
The resource center
In the Public Interest
documented
in its report "Criminal - How Lockup Quotas and
'Low-Crime Taxes'
Guarantee Profits for Private Prison Corporations" that private
prison companies often sign state contracts that guarantee prison
occupancy rates of 90 percent.
If states fail to meet the quota they have to pay the
corporations for the empty beds.
CCA in 2011 gave $710,300 in political contributions
to candidates for federal or state office, political parties and
so-called 527 groups (PACs and super PACs), the American Civil
Liberties Union reported. The corporation also spent $1.07 million
lobbying federal officials plus undisclosed sums to lobby state
officials, according to
the ACLU.
The United States, from 1970 to 2005, increased its
prison population by about 700 percent, according to statistics
gathered by the ACLU.
The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, the ACLU
report notes, says for-profit companies presently control about 18
percent of federal prisoners and 6.7 percent of all state prisoners.
Private prisons account for nearly all newly built
prisons. And nearly half of all immigrants detained by the federal
government are shipped to for-profit prisons, according to
Detention Watch
Network.
But corporate profit is not limited to building and
administering prisons.
Whole industries now rely almost exclusively
on prison labor. Federal prisoners, who are among the highest paid
in the U.S. system, making as much as $1.25 an hour, produce the
military's helmets, uniforms, pants, shirts, ammunition belts, ID
tags and tents.

Prisoners in some states run dairy farms, staff call
centers, take hotel reservations or work in slaughterhouses.
And
prisoners are used to carry out public services such as collecting
highway trash in states such as Ohio.
States, with shrinking budgets, share in the
corporate exploitation. They get kickbacks of as much as 40 percent
from corporations that prey on prisoners. This kickback money is
often supposed to go into "inmate welfare funds," but prisoners say
they rarely see any purchases made by the funds to improve life
inside prison.
The wages paid to prisoners for labor inside prisons
have remained stagnant and in real terms have declined over the past
three decades. In New Jersey a prisoner made $1.20 for eight hours
of work - yes, eight hours of work - in 1980 and today makes $1.30
for a day's labor. Prisoners earn, on average, $28 a month.
Those incarcerated in for-profit prisons earn as
little as 17 cents an hour.
However, items for sale in prison commissaries have
risen in price over the past two decades by as much as 100 percent.
And new rules in some prisons, including those in New Jersey,
prohibit families to send packages to prisoners, forcing prisoners
to rely exclusively on prison vendors.
This is as much a psychological blow as a material
one; it leaves families feeling powerless to help loved ones trapped
in the system.
A bar of Dove soap in 1996 cost New Jersey prisoners
97 cents. Today it costs $1.95, an increase of 101 percent. A tube
of Crest toothpaste cost $2.35 in 1996 and today costs $3.49, an
increase of 48 percent.
AA batteries have risen by 184 percent, and a stick
of deodorant has risen by 95 percent. The only two items I found
that remained the same in price from 1996 were frosted flake cereal
and cups of noodles, but these items in prisons have been switched
from recognizable brand names to generic products.
The white Reebok shoes that most prisoners wear,
shoes that lasts about six months, costs about $45 a pair. Those who
cannot afford the Reebok brand must buy, for $20, shoddy shoes with
soles that shred easily. In addition, prisoners are charged for
visits to the infirmary and the dentist and for medications.
Keefe Supply Co., which runs commissaries for an
estimated half a million prisoners in states including Florida and
Maryland, is notorious for price gouging. It sells a single No. 10
white envelope for 15 cents - $15 per 100 envelopes. The typical
retail cost outside prison for a box of 100 of these envelopes is
$7. The company marks up a 3-ounce packet of noodle soup, one of the
most popular commissary items, to 45 cents from 26 cents.
Global Tel Link, a private phone company, jacks up
phone rates in New Jersey to 15 cents a minute, although some
states, such as New York, have relieved the economic load on
families by reducing the charge to 4 cents a minute. The Federal
Communications Commission has determined that a fair rate for a
15-minute interstate call by a prisoner is $1.80 for debit and $2.10
for collect.
The high phone rates imposed on prisoners, who do not
have a choice of carriers and must call either collect or by using
debit accounts that hold prepaid deposits made by them or their
families, are especially damaging to the 2 million children with a
parent behind bars.
The phone is a lifeline for the children of the
incarcerated.
Monopolistic telephone contracts
give to the states kickbacks amounting, on average, to 42
percent of gross revenues from prisoner phone calls, according to
Prison Legal News.
The companies with exclusive prison phone contracts
not only charge higher phone rates but add to the phone charges the
cost of the kickbacks, called "commissions" by state agencies,
according to research conducted in 2011 by John E. Dannenberg for
Prison Legal News.
Dannenberg found that the phone market in state
prison systems generates an estimated $362 million annually in gross
revenues for the states and costs prisoners' families, who put money
into phone accounts, some $143 million a year.
When strong family ties are retained, there are lower
rates of recidivism and fewer parole violations. But that is not
what the corporate architects of prisons want: High recidivism, now
at over 60 percent, keeps the cages full.
This is one reason, I suspect, why prisons make
visitations humiliating and difficult. It is not uncommon for
prisoners to tell their families - especially those that include
small children traumatized by the security screening, long waits,
body searches, clanging metal doors and verbal abuse by guards - not
to visit.
Prisoners with life sentences frequently urge loved
ones to sever all ties with them and consider them as dead.
The rise of what Marie Gottschalk, the author of
"Caught: The Prison State and the Lockdown of American Politics,"
calls "the carceral state" is ominous.
It will not be reformed
through elections or by appealing to political elites or the courts.
Prisons are not, finally, about race, although poor people of color
suffer the most. They are not even about being poor.
They are
prototypes for the future. They are emblematic of the disempowerment
and exploitation that corporations seek to inflict on all workers.
If corporate power continues to disembowel the
country, if it is not impeded by mass protests and revolt, life
outside prison will soon resemble life in prison.
Correction:
An earlier version of this column included these two
sentences, now deleted:
"CCA [Corrections Corporation of America],
through the American Legislative Exchange Council, also lobbies
legislators to impose harsher detention laws at the state and
federal levels. The ALEC helped draft Arizona's cruel
anti-immigrant law SB 1070."
An email from a public relations executive for CCA
said of the two sentences, in part:
"This is false. Under longstanding policy, CCA
does not draft, lobby for or in any way promote policies that
determine the basis or duration for an individual's
incarceration or detention.
Additionally, the story implies CCA is a current
member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC),
which is false. CCA previously maintained a non-voting
membership with ALEC for the purpose of monitoring policy trends
and developments, but that ended in 2010.
The genesis for this information is a report from
NPR [National Public Radio] that has since been explicitly
clarified."
