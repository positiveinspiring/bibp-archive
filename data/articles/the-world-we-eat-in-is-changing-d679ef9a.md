Associated Press writers from around the
world recently reported in:
-
In Mauritania in West Africa, rice
prices doubled over the first three months of the year, according to
the World Food Program
-
Over the same period, the price of corn
rose 59 percent in Zimbabwe and 57 percent in neighboring Mozambique
-
In Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Mami Monga pays $25 for a box of fish that cost $10 a year
ago
-
The price of a 25-kilogram bag of rice
has doubled to $30
-
In China, food costs rose 5.9 percent in
April over a year ago
-
Indias food prices were up 17 percent
in April over a year earlier
The world we eat in is changing.
The situation is not good. Going into the year
2010 a billion people in our world were already going hungry and well on
their way to pandemic malnutrition and starvation. Conditions have rapidly
been getting worse for families around the world that are being battered by
surging food prices. Rising food costs are dragging more people into
poverty, fueling political tensions and forcing more and more people to go
hungry.
Food is now costing up to 70 percent of family income in the poorest
areas of the world as rising prices are squeezing household budgets.
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organizations
food price index - which includes grains, meat, dairy and other items in 90
countries - was up 22 percent in March from a year earlier.
In some Asian markets, rice and wheat prices are
20 to 70 percent above 2008 levels.
Less Food Planted
Because of Heavy Rains
Well what it is bringing is less food to the
worlds tables with vast tracks of land implantable this year and with the
incredible food bowel of the Gulf of Mexico being destroyed by
the oil volcano.
In Canada unusually heavy rain is forcing
farmers to abandon approximately 1 million acres unplanted. About 30 percent
of northeastern Saskatchewan, or more than 1 million acres designated for
wheat, canola and barley,
might go unplanted this year. Conditions
for late spring planting are among the wettest ever on the Canadian
Prairies.
The average temperature so far this May in Idaho
has been 48.1 degrees, a full 5 degrees below normal. A cold spring is not
helping matters at all in the agricultural sector.
Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have launched major operations to move
thousands of people from houses threatened by rising water.
In Croatia, more than 90 per cent of
farmland in eastern regions was under water and a state of emergency was
declared. Farmlands are being damaged by excess rain this year, and in
Eastern Europe there is a lot of devastation to infra-structure.
More than 220,000 hectares of land - one 20th
of Hungarys arable land - is under water
with about 50,000 hectares of farmland destroyed, causing estimated 300
million Euros damage to the farm sector. Neither local governments, nor
anyone else, has money to spare to repair damages with economies already on
their backs.
In Oregon, record-setting June rains and a
wetter than usual May have put farm crops at risk for disease and have
pushed backed the date that fruits and vegetables will be ready for market.
It looks a lot more like March than it
looks like June, said Tom Lively of Lively Organics. We havent been
able to get in with tillers or hoes because its so muddy that it would
just clump up in the equipment.
By Saturday, pretty much all the melons we
had planted had root rotted and died in spots, Lively said. We just
had big rows of dead melons.
Meanwhile, the garlic crop isnt doing any
better.
A fungus - caused by the excess rain - is
destroying the garlic bulbs. At 18 people are dead in Arkansas following
severe flooding in the southwestern area of the state in Montgomery County.
And now as the true depth and scope of the Gulf oil mega disaster unfolds
before our very eyes America is taking a dramatic hit to its seafood supply.
Not only is the entire Gulf threatened but the Eastern Seaboard as well as
the North Atlantic.
And all the fresh water fish are contaminated
with mercury and fresh water fish dont have the same levels of selenium to
protect themselves and us from the mercury toxicity.
Less Food Grows in the Cold
The mercury dipped to minus 1.7°C (29°F) on June
3rd in the Daegwallyeong region in Pyeongchang County, Korea, the lowest
temperature in June since record-taking began in the region in 1971, the
Korea Meteorological Administration said.
The cold wave began at the end of last month.
According to the state-run agencys statistics,
the average temperature of the East Sea regions was 15.4 degrees,
2.8 degrees lower than the average for this
time of year.
Many parts
of Sweden also endured a record number of
days with of sub-zero temperatures this past winter. The northern Swedish
towns of Sveg and Delsbo had 84 and 71 consecutive days of minus
temperatures, while the Härjedalen town of Sveg endured sub-zero
temperatures from December 13th to March 6th - the
longest consecutive period since records began in 1875.
Summer is coming but what kind of summer is it going to be? And next
winter, will it be even colder and wetter than this last one?
Mainstream scientific experts are weighing in on
this incredibly crucial issue. Mainstream Fox News reported on Dr.
Don Easterbrook, emeritus professor of geology at Western Washington
University and author of more than 150 peer-reviewed papers, who has
unveiled evidence for his prediction that
global cooling is arriving on center stage
no matter what you might read to the contrary in the mainstream press.
Easterbrook spoke before a group of about 700 scientists and government
officials at the fourth International Conference on Climate Change.
The conference is presented annually in Chicago
by the Heartland Institute, a conservative nonprofit think tank that
actively questions the theory of mans role in global warming.
Global warming is over - at least
for a few decades, Easterbrook told conference attendees. However, the
bad news is that global cooling is even more harmful to humans than
global warming, and a cause for even greater concern.
Easterbrook made several stunning claims about
the effects of the coming cold.
There will be twice as many people killed by
extreme cold than by extreme heat, he predicted, and global food
production will suffer because of the shorter, cooler growing seasons and
bad weather during harvest seasons.
Another presenter at the conference, James M.
Taylor, an
environmental policy expert and a fellow at
the Heartland Institute, said that global cooling is already
happening.
Based on figures provided by the
Rutgers University Global Snow Lab, he
noted that snow records from the last 10 years exceeded the records set in
the 1960s and 1970s.
Its Getting Colder
Didnt You Know?
On Tuesday the 8th of June, South Carolina Republican Lindsey
Graham told reporters that he would vote against the climate bill he
helped author. Now hes going one step further. Graham, one of the few
Republicans who claimed to care about climate change, now says global
warming is no big deal.
But the
United Nation still believes that the worlds nations is a huge
deal and that we have no choice but to join forces to stop
global warming,
Governments will meet this challenge, for
the simple reason that humanity must meet this challenge. We just dont
have another option, said the new U.N. climate chief said.
So much for the integrity of the UN!
National surveys released during the last eight months have been interpreted
as showing that fewer and fewer Americans believe that climate change is
real, human-caused and threatening to people yet the American Senate is
still trying to pass global warming legislation.
Life and civilization does not get much more
ridiculous except of course when it comes to discussions about the safety
and efficacy of vaccines.
It can get worse than
we Imagine
This essay does not pretend to go into all the factors affecting global food
production and the looming shortages, price rises, diminishing world food
stocks, water shortages, soil depletion and tragic use of food supplies for
making fuel.
Humanity is in the beginning stages of a
dramatic world crisis of epic proportions and even mother earth is raging
with her volcanoes.
Looks like a nuclear bomb going off but actually
its a volcano and there are many of them around the world who are blowing
their tops putting vast amounts of materials into the atmosphere and this is
destined to make the cooling trend worse making food even more difficult to
grow in the extreme latitudes.
Major eruptions alter the Earths radiative
balance because volcanic aerosol clouds absorb terrestrial radiation, and
scatter a significant amount of the incoming solar radiation, an effect
known as radiative forcing that can last from two to three years following
a volcanic eruption.
San Diego State Universitys geology department noted that,
Thirty years later, in 1815, the eruption
of Mt. Tambora, Indonesia, resulted in an extremely cold spring and
summer in 1816, which became known as the year without a summer.
It was so cold that summer that it snowed in
June, July and August.
Eyjafjallajokulls eruption wont cause
anything like that to happen, because it simply wasnt strong enough but
there is increased activity around the globe with strong eruptions and
plumes going up to fifty thousand feet or more. The cumulative effect will
be slightly cooling but it will take a really major eruption for this type
of cooling to become dramatic.
One is threatening from an even larger volcano
right down the block from Eyjafjallajokull, which just this week is
demonstrating increasing earthquake activity.
On April 14th, the Icelandic
volcano, Eyjafjallajokul, violently erupted, disrupting air travel over
Europe and the UK. Six days later, on April 20th, a BP
deepwater drilling platform exploded, gushing oil into the Gulf of
Mexico causing what will be the greatest environmental disaster in US
history; and, in May, the Greek debt crisis exploded bringing into
question the future of the Euro and, indeed, Europe. What will June
bring, asks Darryl Schoon.
For a frightening view of where we are heading
with the oil disaster please see Lindsey Williams on the Alex
Jones Show.
Conclusion
Its time to move to Mars!
And would you believe that in the news this
month we do read about an international group being locked away for 365 days
to simulate such a voyage. I kid you not. Its amazing the things people
still have money for.
What I am going to suggest you spend your money on, if you have any to
spare, is on Survival Medicines like magnesium chloride, iodine and sodium
bicarbonate. And now on Rejuvenate, which has changed the shape and priority
order of my protocol for cancer and everything else.
Instead of my trinity of super star medicines
they are being joined by Rejuvenate making a crystal foursome that will
cover so much medical and healing territory it will take me books to talk
about it. Read my new essay on Super Food for Cellular Survival and Cellular
Stress and Adaptive Cellular Capacity for starters.
The point though here is purchasing quantities of Rejuvenate for a food
storage program.
I cannot think of a better survival food
because:
-
It has a long shelf life of two, three
or even four years.
-
Rejuvenate is so nutritionally dense one
can easily live on it and water and only get more healthy and strong
in the process.
-
It will give one a lot of energy.
-
And because it tastes great meaning it
will be a joy to eat.
-
With Rejuvenate we constantly eat
through our survival stocks so we turn our inventory over. Even if
worst case scenarios dont materialize we lose nothing and this
program costs little in reality for what we are buying in advance is
the food and nutrition we need to be eating anyway to sustain
ourselves. With threatening food shortages and price explosions
upward investing ahead of time in ones own food supply is prudent.
-
Rejuvenate also becomes part of our
medicine cabinet. Dont ever underestimate the power of super
nutrition to heal one from the suffering of disease. It is also,
along with magnesium and iodine the best among all preventive
medicines.
I personally will be really happy and feel more
secure when I have six months of Rejuvenate on hand and this week we are
also beginning to plant everywhere we can around the house and will also do
some upside down hanging gardens.
Our nation has been on a collision course
with simple, natural living for quite some time.
People in cities are crammed into high-rise
apartment complexes, working 12 hours per day, eating fast food as a
daily staple, and getting sicker by the minute. What will it take to
reverse this trend? Well, unfortunately, we dont seem to be able to do
this on our own.
It is taking
an
economic crash, the likes of which pales the 1929 fiasco to
get us thinking about going back to the basics of growing our own food.
The truth is, for far too many of us, if we dont start developing some
basic survival skills, we simply wont eat, writes
Barbara Peterson.
