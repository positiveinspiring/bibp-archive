Under the guise of fighting "climate change,"
United Nations and World Bank "carbon" programs in Africa are leading to,
Now, a coalition of activist organizations is
demanding an end to the controversial UN-linked plots that are devastating
communities while endangering indigenous peoples and cultures already at
risk of extinction.
Criticism surrounding the ongoing promotion of "carbon
credits" is also escalating worldwide from across the political spectrum.
The latest accusations of terror and brutality
perpetrated against innocent civilians to supposedly battle "global warming"
- on "pause"
for 18 years and counting, according to undisputed temperature data -
come from Kenya.
While the United Nations-linked forced evictions
are not new, they are accelerating.
Just last
year, the UN also unveiled a
massive eugenics program for the East African nation
aimed at slashing the population. Whether the ruthless carbon-dioxide
machinations by the UN and the World Bank are related remains unclear.
The victims in the most recent abuses are the
Sengwer communities in Kenya's Embobut forest and Cherangany Hills.
According to reports by the Forest Peoples Program, a U.K.-based
non-profit organization that supports the rights of forest dwellers, more
than one thousand Sengwer homes were torched by World Bank-funded
authorities earlier this year as the Kenyan government works to evict some
15,000 members from their ancestral lands.
Inaccurately referring to the
indigenous peoples as "squatters," officials claim the effort is aimed at
promoting "sustainability."
"We saw dozens of houses burning as we moved
through Sengwer community lands," the forest peoples' organization said
in a statement about the atrocities.
"We saw well over a hundred homes either
burning or that had been burnt, and the area was eerily empty of people.
People have run away out of fear
When their homes are burnt, blankets,
food and cooking utensils are also burnt, so children and the elderly
are exposed to the cold and go hungry."
The group also interviewed some of the locals
whose communities were being razed to the ground by the World Bank-funded
Kenyan Forest Service.
"All school uniforms, cooking pans, water
containers, cups were burnt," a 25-year-old Sengwer widow with four
small children said as her home was still burning.
"The children are very upset because we have
lost everything. The children and elderly people will end up getting
pneumonia because we don't have anything to cover ourselves at night."
She also said there was no consultation with
locals or compensation for the seizure of property.
In a
letter denouncing what a coalition of more than 65 global non-profit
groups referred to as "genocide," a spokesman for the Sengwer, Yator Kiptum,
blasted as a "disaster" the property destruction, brutalization, and forced
evictions.
"The government of Kenya is forcing us into
extinction," he was quoted as saying.
The letter also points out that the schemes are
a violation of Kenyan law, the constitution, international human rights
agreements, and various court orders.
Also this year, the group Survival
International, a charity that works with tribal peoples around the world,
documented similar government atrocities in Kenya's Mau forest. There,
rampaging government officials backed by globalist outfits have been
persecuting and forcibly evicting members of the Ogiek, described as one of
Africa's last remaining hunter-gather tribes.
The tribes may disappear
entirely if measures are not taken to restrain authorities and their
"carbon" scams. Reports suggest that people involved in resisting the forced Ogiek evictions are being targeted by authorities for extrajudicial
execution, too.
Apparently, Kenyan politicians and their cronies
are also getting wealthy on the land-grab schemes - at the expense of the
poor indigenous peoples whose communities are being burned to the ground.
Beyond local corruption, though, the scope of the problem reaches deep into
the UN, the World Bank, the global establishment, and various international
"climate" schemes.
In fact, the evictions underway in Kenya
are "a direct result" of a World Bank plot and are "effectively funded by
the World Bank," according to a formal Sengwer complaint filed with the
infamous global organization. Much of the program in question, meanwhile,
stems from the UN's "Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest
Degradation," or
REDD for short.
Under that global scheme, the purchase of
"carbon credits" - supposedly aimed at reducing CO2
emissions to stop "global warming" - are linked to the amount of carbon
contained in forests.
Despite being
absurdly demonized by UN as "pollution," CO2 is
exhaled by humans and described by scientists as
the "gas of life."
"The devastating plight of Kenya's indigenous
peoples is symptomatic of the flawed approach to conservation on the part of
international agencies," explained journalist Nafeez Ahmed in an
explosive article for the U.K. Guardian this month about the
Kenyan land grabs.
"In practice, REDD schemes largely allow
those companies to accelerate pollution while purchasing land and
resources in the developing world at bargain prices."
Land, apparently, that has been ethnically
cleansed of all its previous native inhabitants.
The brutalization of Kenyans and the massive
land grabs began accelerating in 2007, when the Kenyan Forest Service began
a deeply controversial partnership with the World Bank to implement a
so-called "Natural Resource Management" project. Since then, activists
report that Sengwer homes have been under virtual non-stop attack by
authorities aiming to uproot the indigenous peoples.
Once the joint World
Bank-Kenyan government plot was approved without any input from the Sengwer,
the communities suddenly learned that their centuries-old ancestral
homelands were inside a "forest reserve" and subject to destruction and
seizure.
In a statement, the World Bank
attempted to distance itself from the atrocities, saying it was not
involved and that it was "concerned" about the reports.
"The World Bank stands ready to assist the
Government of Kenya with its development advice drawing on its local and
global project experiences, and to share best practices in resettlement
in line with its safeguard policies," the statement said.
"These seek to improve or restore the living
standards of people affected by involuntary resettlement."
The bank also claimed it was investigating.
Among critics, though, the semi-denial prompted
a furious backlash.
"The cause and effect is perfectly clear;
the Bank in its highly controversial role as both carbon credit
financier and broker is aiding and abetting the forced relocation of an
entire Indigenous People through its Natural Resource Management Plan (NRMP)
which includes REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation)," noted the No REDD in Africa Network (NRAN), an alliance
of 66 human-rights organizations that opposes the UN plot.
Most disturbing about the World Bank response,
the network said, was the outfit's offer to help the Kenyan government in
matters of "involuntary" resettlement.
"The World Bank is both admitting its
complicity in the forced relocation of the Sengwer People as well as
offering to collude with the Kenyan government to cover-up cultural
genocide," the alliance explained, adding that the Sengwer were now
"facing complete annihilation under the guise of conservation' under
REDD."
The No REDD network also named the developments
"carbon colonialism."
The organization also argued that the UN scheme
was,
"emerging as a new form of colonialism,
economic subjugation and a driver of land grabs so massive that they may
constitute a continent grab."
The letter, signed by over 300 human-rights
activists and over five-dozen international organizations, also offered a
list of demands to Kenyan authorities, planetary entities involved in the
schemes, and more.
"We demand that governments, companies,
carbon traders, the World Bank and the United Nations including UN-REDD,
UNEP, UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] and others immediately
cancel these harmful REDD and other carbon offset schemes," they
concluded.
Even international officials involved in the
UN's REDD machinations expressed outrage over the developments.
"The carbon markets, when up and running,
need to support the forest stewardship of the people who live there, and
not provide national governments with yet another tool to dispossess
their citizens from the natural resources they have cared for and
depended on for generations," former chair of UN REDD negotiations Tony
La Vi√±a told The Guardian.
As reported, the atrocities in Kenya
are hardly the first time that Western "carbon offset" scams by the UN, the
European Union, and other international entities have come under fire for
brutalizing people and destroying entire communities in Third World
nations.
In Uganda, for example,
tens of thousands of innocent farmers had their villages burned to the
ground so international institutions could plant "carbon-credit" trees on
the land.
Reports of children murdered and brutal beatings
also grabbed headlines. Dozens of Honduran murders in 2011
were also linked to
United Nations-backed land grabs and "carbon" schemes.
Other gargantuan land grabs backed by
multiple globalist outfits are taking place worldwide, some, ironically,
under the guise of protecting the rights of indigenous peoples under UN
treaties. In Brazil, for example,
whole towns were recently evicted at gunpoint by federal troops
wearing UN logos using the easily debunked pretext of "returning"
land to a handful of Indians who had never even lived in the area.
With accusations of cultural genocide in Kenya
now in the headlines of major Western media outlets, outrage is growing
quickly against peddlers of "carbon offset" scams:
...and various
other international outfits.
However, even as
the theories underpinning the climate alarmism crumble, it has become
clear that without a massive outcry, the atrocities and land grabs around
the globe will continue under virtually any pretext.
