There are two types of people in this world; those who worship the ideal of
centralized command authority, and those who do not.
Those who value freedom regardless of risk or
pain, and those who value slavery in a desperate bid to avoid risk and pain.
When I consider the ultimate folly of man, in the end I look to the meek and
unquestioning masses who strive to avoid risk, because it is they who always
end up feeding the machines of war, despair, and tyranny.
The power thirsty halls of elitism surely
instigate and manipulate the tides of this wretched ocean of quivering
souls, but ultimately, the weak-hearted and weak minded make all terrible
conquests possible.
-
They live by the rule of fear, and their
fear drives them to seek control; control of their environment,
control of others, and by extension they believe, control of the
future.
-
They attempt to mitigate their
overwhelming fear by containing the world and sterilizing it of
everything wild, untamed, and unknown.
-
They dream of a society of pure
predictability, and zero responsibility.
-
They are willing to sacrifice almost
anything to attain this position of artificial comfort.
The concept of "big government"
appeals to such people for many reasons...
Government in most cases is nothing but an abstraction. It is merely a tool
that serves the interests of a particular group of people at any given time.
Modern politics is an expression of the foolish cat fight between factions
of people to decide who gets to wield the weapon of government and impose
their ideology on the rest of us.
At least, that's what it almost always devolves
into.
The great illusion of the system, though, is
that ANY group of average people ever actually wields any power. The truth
is, big governments are always operated by very small and exclusive clubs of
root beneficiaries out of the sight of the population.
The smaller this dominant group becomes, the more corrupt and criminal the
government generally is. A government reaches a state of despotism whenever
its functions are twisted for the sake of an elite few to the detriment of
the common man, and when it ignores the natural inborn rights of the
individual for the sake of some fabricated collective.
If one were to closely examine the birth of
every iron-fisted oligarchy throughout history, they would find a cyclical
pattern of centralization; the removal of checks and balances, the removal
of legitimate public involvement in the political process, a dependent and
infantilized citizenry, and the rise of a "bureaucratic class" which regards
itself as superior and born to lead.
All steps taking place within Western
societies today.
Unfortunately, the masses tend to view big government as an inevitability of
life; as a natural extension of culture. Rarely if ever do they ask what
tangible purpose it serves.
Are they really getting what they want out of
their government?
Or, is the government taking what it wants from them?
I have always found the worshipful attitude that some citizens ascribe to
government simultaneously fascinating and disturbing, because these people
are not bowing down to a wise and benevolent entity.
Rather, they are bowing
down to their own delusions of what they believe that entity to be.
The most dangerous and insidious of governments
present themselves as a kind of social vanity mirror. They allow the
citizenry to project their collective desires, biases, shortcomings, and
fears, and reflect back an image that entices and placates the majority.
The lies and manipulations of big government are
designed to satiate our basest fantasies, but what we see as a concrete
edifice of political and legal might, in the end, is a mirage mired in the
fog of our own na√Øve expectations.
So, the question again arises:
if the structure of big government is built
upon deceit and misrepresentation, what tangible purpose does it really
serve?
The answer is no purpose... at least, no
purpose that elevates and enriches the public at large.

Big government is not a "necessary evil". It is just evil.
Like the ring of Sauron, it lures in the weak
with promises of power, but this power is a ruse. Each side of our false
left/right paradigm, Democrat and Republican, thinks that if only THEY were
the bearers of the ring they would "finally use it for good".
But once in
their possession, they are overtaken, overwhelmed, and corrupted by personal
temptation.
The Democratic Party, with all of its proclamations of humanism and
respect for civil liberties, is a perfect example.
How quickly did the rank and file Democrats turn
away from their anti-war, anti-torture, anti-banker, anti-surveillance,
anti-tyranny stance once
Barack Obama, a self proclaimed
Democrat, was placed in office?
Very quickly...!
And what about the common Republican?
How many of them utterly abandoned
their ideals of limited government, reduced spending, Constitutional rights,
and Christian understanding as soon as
Bush and the Neo-Con regime was
installed?
Most of them...!
And when all is said and done, who has reaped profits and gained dominance
during both disastrous administrations? The corporate high priests and
international banking cartels, not the oblivious participants of
the fake political theater.
Yet, a masochistic cycle of misplaced trust
in the system on the part of the masses continues...
If these latest signs of big government corruption aren't enough to make the
public question the validity of the establishment, I'm not sure what will...
The Rape Of Cyprus
Even in the face of unmitigated government theft, I still hear the
occasional rationalization of
the Cyprus debacle.
Defenders of the bailout measures (which the EU
demanded) allowing the confiscation of private citizen savings to pay off
government mismanaged debt, argue two things:
-
The banks that were targeted contained
"Russian blood money" and hidden funds, so confiscation really
amounted to a "punishment of rich criminals" rather than the Cyprus
public.
-
It is "better" that the citizens go
along with the confiscation of a percentage of their accounts,
rather than lose everything through collapse.
Just to be clear, any sizable Russian funds
being stored in Cyprus were removed before the bailout measures were
instituted.
Therefore, the assertion that such people were
"punished" is a lie and a distraction.
The Russian scapegoat was merely being promoted
by global financiers and political elites in order to con people around the
world (not just those in Cyprus) to accept the concept of government theft
of private funds as being "moral" under "certain extraneous circumstances".
When a government wants you to set aside your
conscience in support of an immoral action that serves their interests, they
will almost always conjure a false villain and engineered consequences for
you to direct your fear and anger at.
Once they can convince you to abandon your own
principles to smite an imaginary enemy or avoid a manufactured threat, even
if only one time, it will be much easier for them to convince you again a
second time.
Large and corrupt governments love to use the magic of the false choice.
For instance,
"...it is better to sacrifice
some of your money and your principles to the establishment than it is
to live through total collapse of the nation..."
This false choice process, though, never ends.
The offending government will demand more
property and more freedom from the citizenry everyday while constantly
warning that if we do not submit, the alternative will be "far worse".
The truth is, Cyprus is not the issue. What the disaster in Cyprus reflects,
however, concerns us all. It is a moment of precedence; an action which sets
the stage for the final destruction of the idea of private property. It
dissolves one of the final barriers to total government control.
Governments and elitists have always stolen from
the public through misspent taxation and rampant inflation, but with Cyprus,
we see a renewed feudalistic paradigm.
The EU and the banking hierarchy are sending a
message to the Western world:
You are now their personal emergency fund,
and nothing you own is actually yours anymore.
When an institution confiscates property and
capital at will from a subdued and frightened populace without consent, they
are essentially exploiting the labor of that populace.
In any culture or language, this is called
"slavery".
Private Corporations
Openly Dictating The Law
As most in the Liberty Movement know, the seeds of Fascism germinate in the
soil where the corporate world meets the political world.
This is one of the primary reasons why we will
stop at nothing to eliminate entities like the Federal Reserve; a privately
run banking cartel that mingles with government yet answers to no one,
including Congress or the people. The FED has existed since 1913, and has
dominated the value and circulation of our currency ever since.
However, today, they are taking
on new powers...
As a part of the recent bailout bonanza and the legislation surrounding it,
the FED has begun writing operational policy for other private banking
institutions:
FED orders Citigroup to improve money laundering
checks.
The transition has been subtle but the implications are dangerous.
The
FED is becoming a regulatory body with expanding influence
outside of the electoral process. It is preparing the ground for other
private central banks to become fully unaccountable governing structures.
Right now, they are limited to the banking
sector, but eventually, this dynamic will poison every aspect of the
financial world until every economic decision will be made without any
oversight from the public.
Moving in a slightly different direction, the Federal Government is
beginning to establish law which removes the ability of the public to have
any means of redress against particular corporations.
The 'Monsanto
Protection Act' hidden within the pages of
the HR 933 spending bill creates
special circumstances that protect the GMO producer from litigation and
public examination over the dangerous genetic products it markets.
This legislation, in essence, builds a coalition
between Monsanto and the government, and even allows Monsanto in some cases
to dictate what the government can and cannot do when dealing with GMO's.
The Obama Administration's support of this bill should be a shock to any
environmentally inclined Democrat, and any Democrat who is still willing to
defend Obama after learning of this legislation, in my opinion, is a lost
cause.
This move on the part of our government is striking because of its open
criminality.
It shows that we have entered a new stage of the
totalitarian process; one that will invariably lead us to catastrophe.
Legislation By Special
Interest Group
In the halls of big government, politicians do not produce major
legislation.
Rather, bureaucrats and think tanks fashion
policy while elected officials serve as mouthpieces and middlemen.
How often do we discover after the passage of particularly nefarious pieces
of legislation that the politicians who voted for them NEVER read the bills
themselves?
This past week, sources within NY governor
Andrew Cuomo's administration claimed that he didn't actually read
the NY Safe Act before championing it,
and blamed the vast mistakes and unconstitutional oversteps of the bill
on Mayor Bloomberg and the Brady Center.
Source
Now, I do not believe that Cuomo was not
aware of the implications of the Safe Act, even if he didn't read the bill.
But I do believe that the bill was drafted
purely by special interest groups like the Brady Center without any
oversight from actual state legislators, who then passed it overnight
without a second thought.
In a big government system, legislative wrangling is non-stop. A bureaucracy
thrives on the endless introduction of new laws and new restrictions, and so
it makes perfect sense that political representatives, who now act merely as
mascots, never have the time to read all the paperwork.
Why would they read it, when they are no longer
making decisions on such policies anyway? All they have to do is vote how
they are told to vote by their handlers, and trust that they will be
protected by the establishment from public anger.
Legislation by proxy is rampant in our government today, and it begs
us to consider this:
If our government has become so oversized
and complex that our elected leaders can no longer oversee the actual
writing of legislation and must use private think tanks to write it for
them, perhaps we should cut the system down until their work load is
manageable.
The alternative is a legal and political
structure that is engineered entirely by obscure interest groups with an
agenda, and this is highly unacceptable.
Complete Disregard For
Individual Rights
In the evolution of big government, there comes a point at which the
oligarchy has attained enough power that it feels safe in admitting its true
intentions.
Usually, this is done in the name of the
"greater good". Sometimes, they don't even try to sugar coat it.
This past week, NY Mayor Michael Bloomberg in an unguarded moment
stated the underlying philosophy behind the impositions of government
control over the people.
When questioned about the Constitutionality of
the growing
drone surveillance grid in American skies,
Bloomberg had this to say:
"Everybody wants their
privacy, but I don't know how you're going to maintain it.
It's just we're going into a
different world, uncharted, and, like it or not, what people can do,
what governments can do, is different. And you can to some extent
control, but you can't keep the tides from coming in."
"The argument against using automation, it's this craziness - oh, it's
Big Brother. Get used to it."
Source
And there you have it.
The new age (for
Bloomberg and big government elites like him) is a place in which
government is separate and above the people. The government does not exist
to serve the citizenry; the citizenry exists to serve the government.
Privacy is a privilege that governments can take
anytime they wish. Citizens, being slaves, should not expect such
privileges. And, this subjugated nightmare world is a place that we must
accept as a natural extension of progress.
Big
Brother is the future, so grow up and "get used to it"...
I will not be "getting used to it", and neither will millions of Americans
like me. We'll tear the whole monstrosity down first.
Institutions of law and order are supposed to reflect the highest inherent
principles of humanity and defend those principles regardless of the nature
of the times. Honor and conscience do not suddenly become obsolete simply
because danger looms, or catastrophe strikes.
Big government bastardizes the original intent of the founders, who formed a
small subservient central federal structure to fulfill one purpose - as a
protector of the natural freedoms of the population.
The federal system was
never meant to have any domestic power beyond this task, nor should it.
Today, as we have shown over and over again, the
centralized political behemoth we live under is absolutely unnecessary and
completely destructive to the freedom and prosperity of the culture it was
originally tasked to defend.
It can and must be dissolved, and it is time for
average Americans to deeply and seriously ponder this option rather than
ignorantly assume that because it exists, it should exist.
Otherwise, like a weaponized cancer, it will
devour what is left of the healthy fabric of our society and destroy
whatever good remains within us.
