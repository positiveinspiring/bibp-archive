15 - The Nazi Code
In the late 19th and early 20th century, Germany was in a peculiar political
position. It needed to rediscover its own identity following the loss of its
Holy Roman imperial power.
To this end various secret societies sprang up
under the guise of esoteric and philosophical schools. From this base
emerged what was to become one of the worlds most dangerous secret
societies - the German Order.
One man, more than any other, can be identified as the driving force behind
this new wave - Baron Rudolf Freiherr von Serbottendorff. It was von
Serbottendorff who was more than incidental in growing the Thule Gesechafft,
which came out of the German Order. This Thule Society was a new secret
group based supposedly upon ancient Nordic mythology, but in reality was
more Eastern than most writers realize.
In 1918, von Serbottendorff purchased the Munchener Beobachter, a weekly
Munich newspaper, which he transformed into an anti-Semitic scandal sheet
and the Thule Societys official publication.
The Thule society, as we will discover, went on to give birth to the Nazi
Party and the rest is history.
However, I wondered just who was this von Serbottendorff and why is it that
he would be so implicated in the proposed takeover of the world?
It amazingly transpires that von Serbottendorff was an adopted Turkish
citizen with links in the now infamous Sufi tradition and an adept of the
mysteries. No wonder then that the later Thule Society and the Nazi Party
should have mystical leanings. It has also been claimed that his real
European name was Adam Alfred Rudolf Blauer and that he was involved in
Bavarian anti-communist struggles.
Amazingly, he was also a Freemason, and
just prior to World War I he had made several trips to the Near East, where
he became involved in the mystery tradition.
In the Balkan War of 19121913, he was implicated in directing the Turkish
Red Crescent and was made Master of the Order of the Rose Garland (Rosenkranz).
All of this is at the height of Rosicrucian fame in Europe, and as some
would have it, the Rosicrucians were more potent in the life of the Western
World than any of the visible Governments.
In 1910, while living in Istanbul, Serbottendorff controlled his own secret
society based on a combination of Islamic Sufi mysticism, masonry, alchemy,
and anti-Bolshevik ideology - the perfect occult base for the Nazi party.
It transpires that he eventually established a sect of devotees along the
lines of the fedayeen or Assassins, who were guided by their spiritual
leader, the Old Man of the Mountain. He had basically set up a
semi-religious and militant secret society whose purpose was to change the
world.
According to Dr. Walter Johannes Stein, the Thule Society was a Society of
Assassins holding secret meetings and issuing death orders. This murderous
method of political change had been brought to the German Thule Society by
von Serbottendorff, who spread the word though his newspaper interests.
Franz Gurtner, the president of police in Munich, was a member of the inner
circle and later became minister of justice under the Third Reich.
The Thule Society served as the recruiting and political platform front of
the German Order. In 1918, the Workers Political Circle, with the Thule
Society representative Karl Harrer as chairman, was set up, and in 1919 this
became the German Workers Party.
Only one year later this became the NSDAP
(Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei) or Nazi Party under the
later leadership of Adolf Hitler.
We know that there were links between these organizations as Serbottendorff
himself stated:
Thule members were the people to whom Hitler first turned
and who first allied themselves with Hitler.
I found that the ancient Sufi tradition had influenced the West to a greater
degree than I had previously believed. But, here with the Thule Society, I
had Serbottendorff bringing Sufi and Islamic mysticism directly into the
German political state.
Serbottendorff is even on record as having stated that Muslim Masters had
entrusted him with Illuminating Germany, and he did so by allying Sufism
to ancient Aryan mythology.
Following the rise of Adolf Hitler, who discovered the Society after he had
been ordered to spy on them, Serbottendorffs newspaper was bought out by
Dietrich Eckart, a Bavarian Catholic who had helped form the German Workers
Party - and thus the newspaper was now under German rule, for obvious
reasons.
It was Eckart who introduced Hitler to the more esoteric ways of the world,
and it was Eckart who transcribed Mein Kampf. When they came to power,
Hitler set up the SS, a secret Order of the Silver Star who went out
initiating people into the mysteries. Close ties to Turkey were still in
place, as the mass exterminations of both countries show.
Eckart himself was
highly influenced by the Eastern mysticism and was a follower of Aleister
Crowleys movement. In fact, some researchers have even claimed that Crowley
influenced the Nazi occult movement to such a degree that it may have been
through him that the secret brotherhood were working and thereby
influencing Hitler and his motley crew.
The occult was rife within the Nazi
Party as Himmlers Death Head Units were to show with their ritualized
murders, harking back to Celtic head cults. Not to mention Himmlers
occult-inspired SS, who were headquartered at the castle of Wewelsburg in
Westphalia, where there was a round table with 13 seats.
In 1935, Himmlers SS established the Ahnernerbe (Ancestral Heritage) to
seek out occult secrets that would aid the Nazi Party to victory. They
traveled across the world to Tibet, South America, Rennes le Chateau and
other special places of occult interest.
Without doubt the whole remit of the Nazi Party was to establish an
occult-based theology in a political forum. It was their attempt to
reestablish something that they perceived had already been lost. It was
nothing new. The same thing had already been done in America, where the
Masonic influence had established a Masonic constitution, and the political
family of the United States was and, would be forever, based around arcane
Masonic and occult secrets.
So what was this Thule, and does it give us any clues as to the secrets of
this occult takeover bid?
Thule was named after a fabled island much like Atlantis or Lemuria. It was
believed to have been situated somewhere in the north and was lost a long
time ago, along with its highly developed and intelligent civilization. But
the secrets of this ancient race were not lost; they were, instead, to be
found within the myths and mysteries of the ancient world.
Amazingly,
followers of the Thule Society believed that there were masters hiding in
the background who occasionally influenced the human race, just as the
theosophists and Rosicrucians believed. These were called the Great White
Brotherhood - or Shining Ones.
It was believed that only the true initiate could establish contact with
these masters, through magic and ritual, and once contacted the initiate
would be empowered with great skills and superhuman strength. These extra
skills were given to enable the initiate to create the conditions for the
masters race - the Aryans - to populate the Earth and, thus, exterminate
the inferior races.
This element of extermination was more obvious before and during the war,
with the Holocaust. But it was also used to undermine the strengths of other
countries. In Bavaria, left-wing socialists proclaimed the Bavarian Soviet
Republic. However, this communist movement was not to be tolerated, and so a
counter movement was set up, not surprisingly called the whites. They were
called the Frei Corps and were financed by the Thule Society, bringing swift
defeat to the newly formed Soviet Republic, and yet another example of how a
secret society, grounded on the ancient mysteries, could influence the
world.
Hitler had been on the ground in 1919, as a soldier who went in after the
revolution had been put down. His purpose was to select new recruits and to
investigate those who had opposed the revolution, which he did ruthlessly.
This in turn led to Hitler being given a role in the intelligence division
of the German Army - he was now both inside the official army, and on the
outside, a member of a secret society with intentions of taking power.
Through the rantings of Gottfried Feder of the Thule Society and others like
him, Hitler was secured as a recruit and was more and more intrigued by the
anti-Semitic rhetoric of the group. Soon, Hitler was in charge of propaganda
in the Thule Society.
There are literally hundreds of instances I could cite to show that the
Thule Society and other secret societies were inciting all kinds of changes
within Europe, but just these few collated facts, I believe, sufficiently
show that the politics of the day was not all that I had previously believed
it to be. In fact, there were influences at play, which even I was surprised
about - namely the Sufi influence.
This is also shown in yet another Germanic society called the Order of
Teutons, a magic Lodge set up in 1912 before the Thule Society by Theodor
Fritsch, Philipp Stauff, and Hermann Pohl. All three have been implicated as
anti-Semitic and racist in general. The Order was set up along the same
lines as the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons, with slightly different
degrees of initiation. Only those of Aryan descent were permitted to join.
Again, like the Thule Society, this group was linked with
Rudolf Blauer (aka
von Serbottendorff), who brought with him Sufi ideals and mystic leanings.
The Nazi Party outlawed the Freemasons, and, yet, allowed the Bavarian Order
to continue. It was believed that the Masons had been infiltrated by the
Jews and it was time to purge them from the most holy Orders. One Order
changed its title to The Frederick the Great Association, as Frederick had
been the founder of Masonry in the Germanic states.
They also removed any
obvious Jewish liturgy from their rituals.
The Catholic Part
According to the official statements, the Catholic Church simply kept quiet
during the Hitler reforms.
They even claim that many Catholic priests were
victimized by the Nazis for their part in freeing Jews and other
undesirables. This is true: The Catholic Church did remain quiet, and there
were individuals within the Church that stood up for the rights of man.
However, there is a darker side to the Catholic role in the running of the
Nazi war and Holocaust machines.
As a child, Adolf Hitler attended classes at a Benedictine monastery, which
is where he first saw the now infamous swastika.
Here he sang in the choir
and claimed that he dreamt of one day taking holy orders. (The Rise and Fall
of the Third Reich by William Shirer, Simon & Schuster)
I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so, he is reported to
have said to one of his generals.
(Adolf Hitler by J. Toland)
The Catholic
Church never excommunicated him and, when we consider that a person could be
excommunicated for minor misdemeanours such as giving water to an infidel,
then this is quite a turn-up.
The stark fact remains, that the Catholic Church turned a blind eye to the
Nazi oppression, especially as it had just spent the last few centuries
trying to rid the world of Jewry itself. In fact, taken to this end, and the
hidden links between Freemasonry and the Catholic Church, we can start to
see a picture of a Christian purging of the Jews in process - a process that
appears to have been going on for an awfully long time.
Some have claimed,
however, that this was a balancing act in that the Jews were getting too
powerful in Europe at the time and needed trimming.

The Catholic deal with the Nazis involved having further privileges for its
priests and even permission to get involved in the public school system,
with a massive $400 million in state aid. It also lead to a clearing of
anti-Catholic lawsuits, as by 1940 Hitler had erased or quashed over 7,000
legal cases against Catholic priests.
All in all, the Catholic Church was
doing quite well out of the process.
A Concordat with the Catholic Church in 1933 stated:
The German Reich guarantees the freedom of the
profession and the public exercise of the Catholic
Religion.
Catholics shall enjoy the protection of the State in the same
manner as the employees of the State.
The teaching of the Catholic religion in the
elementary, vocational, secondary and superior
schools shall be a regular subject and shall be given
in conformity with the principles of the Catholic
Church.
(Hitlers Third Reich: A Documentary History
edited by L. Snyder, Nelson-Hall)
To the Catholics, this was all perfect, so why should they make life hard
for the Nazis?
The Nazis gained prestige and, seemingly, backing from the
Roman Catholics. They also needed to ensure that their allies of the future,
Italy, would not be upset.
Many authors have shown that even following the end of the war, the Nazis
were aided in their escapes by their brothers in the Catholic Church -
escaping via monasteries and nunneries and into deeply Catholic countries in
South America - especially with the aid of certain Jesuits. It would not do
to call people into a secret society and then leave them high and dry when
the whole thing collapses.
In fact, I was to wonder whether the plan had
collapsed at all - I was now wondering whether the plan was carried out
perfectly well.
Frans von Papen was the chancellor of Germany between June 1932 and 1933,
and first vice chancellor of the Third Reich under Adolf Hitler. Papen has
been called Hitlers mentor, and to this end he should have theoretically
known what Hitler was thinking.
Papen gives us an insight into these
thoughts in his book My Conversations with Hitler:
Hitler has put into practice the high ideals of the papacy.
What exactly
Papen means by this I really cannot say, but it implies the obvious - that
Adolf Hitler was working directly for the pope.
So, I thought, who is this von Papen?
It turns out that without Papen, Hitler would have struggled to gain power.
Papen made the way smooth for Hitlers rise to power as is shown by him
receiving the vice chancellery following Hitler gaining the chancellery.
Papen was born to a very wealthy Catholic family in Westphalia and served in
World War I in Turkey, of all places, where he was to serve again during
World War II as ambassador. On his return from World War I, he joined
politics on the far right and, in 1932, was plucked from obscurity by
President Hindenburg to be chancellor. It was this friendship that allowed
Hitlers rise to power - as previously Hindenburg had said that he would
never allow Hitler to become chancellor.
Franz von Papen, it seems, was a highly influential individual in the
politics of Nazi Germany, and he was also a Jesuit! High ideals of the
Catholic Church, indeed!
Papen saw through several elements, which helped the integration of the
Catholic ideals, including mixing the Catholic youth with the Hitler youth
and signing the Concordat between the Vatican and Munich. Incidentally, the
cardinal secretary of state, who signed the document on the Vaticans behalf
was Archbishop Eugenio Pacelli who was later to become Pope Pius XII.
Upon
taking his position of pope in 1939, just as Hitlers troops were marching
into Poland, Pope Pius wrote to Hitler:
To the illustrious
Herr Adolf Hitler, Fuhrer, and chancellor of the German
Reich!
Here at the beginning of our pontificate we wish to assure you that
we remain devoted to the spiritual welfare of the German people entrusted to
your leadership.
During the many years we spent in Germany, we did all in
our power to establish harmonious relations between church and state. Now
that the responsibilities of our pastoral function have increased our
opportunities, how much more ardently do we pray to reach that goal?
May the
prosperity of the German people and their progress in every domain come,
with Gods help, to fruition.
Pope Pius began a tradition of holding a birthday party for Hitler sending,
warmest congratulations to the Fuhrer in the name of the Bishops and
diocese of Germany.
Here is what Hitler himself thought of the Jesuit Order:
I learned much from
the Order of the Jesuits.
Until now, there has never been anything more
grandiose on the earth, than the hierarchical organization of the Catholic
Church. I transferred much of this organization into my own party. (www.missiontocatholics.com/Library/Books/
Smokescreen/index.htm)
The S.S. organization had been constituted by Himmler according to the
principles of the Jesuit Order. Their regulations and the Spiritual
Exercises prescribed by Ignatius of Loyola were the model Himmler tried to
copy exactly.
Himmlers title as supreme chief of the S.S. was to be the
equivalent of the Jesuits General and the whole structure was a close
imitation of the Catholic Churchs hierarchical order.
(Walter Schellenberg,
former chief of Nazi counter-espionage quoted from Homeland Security: The
Jesuit Gestapo by Michael Bunker)
Indeed, we even find that a lot, if not all, of Mein Kampf was believed to
have been written by Bernard Staempfle, a Jesuit priest (Secret History of
the Jesuits, Edmond Paris).
It would not be the first time that the Catholic Church has been implicated
in the running of a state, and it would not be the last.
During the research of this subject, I have contacted many people;one of
them was Dianne DiNicola of the pressure group ODAN or Opus Dei Awareness
Network. Dianne, after having checked me out, allowed me to use some of
their material.
The following extract is from their Website www.odan.org and
implicates the Opus Dei in the Franco regime in Spain:
Letter From Escriva to Franco
In the following letter, Opus Dei founder, Escriva, congratulates Spanish
dictator Francisco Franco on the union of church and state in Spain.
According to Giles Tremlett, Opus Deis 84,000 members around the world
deny [Escriva] actively supported Franco; however, this document shows that
at the very least Escriva admired Franco.
Opus Dei also denies that the organization has a political agenda, and
claims that its members have complete freedom as well as personal
responsibility for their actions.
However, the following quote from Escrivas book The Way, which Alberto Moncada describes as a summary of
Escrivas national catholicism, illustrates how difficult it would be for
a member of Opus Dei to reconcile this personal freedom with his counsel:
Nonsectarianism. Neutrality. Those old myths that always try to seem new.
Have you ever bothered to think how absurd it is to leave ones catholicism
aside on entering a university, or a professional association, or a
scholarly meeting, or Congress, as if you were checking your hat at the
door?
Letter From Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer to Francisco Franco
May 23, 1958
The following letter, translated from Spanish (original Spanish text found
here) was published in the January-February, 2001 issue of Razón Española
(magazine title means Spanish Reason).
Copies of this and other letters from
Msgr. Escrivá de Balaguer to Franco are kept in the Fundación Nacional
Francisco Franco (National Foundation of Francisco Franco) (Marqués de
Urquijo, 28, 28008 Madrid, Spain).
The originals belong to Generalísimo
Francos only daughter, Carmen.
To his Excellency Franciso Franco Bahamonde, Head of State of Spain
Your Excellency:
I wish to add my sincerest personal congratulation to the many you have
received on the occasion of the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles.
My forced absence from our homeland in service of God and souls, far from
weakening my love for Spain, has, if it were possible, increased it. From
the perspective of the eternal city of Rome, I have been able to see better
than ever the beauty of that especially beloved daughter of the church which
is my homeland, which the Lord has so often used as an instrument for the
defense and propagation of the holy, Catholic faith in the world.
Although alien to any political activity, I cannot help but rejoice as a
priest and Spaniard that the Chief of States authoritative voice should
proclaim that,
The Spanish nation considers it a badge of honor to accept
the law of God according to the one and true doctrine of the Holy Catholic
Church, inseparable faith of the national conscience which will inspire its
legislation.
It is in fidelity to our peoples Catholic tradition that the
best guarantee of success in acts of government, the certainty of a just and
lasting peace within the national community, as well as the divine blessing
for those holding positions of authority, will always be found.
I ask
God our Lord to bestow upon your Excellency with every sort felicity
and impart abundant grace to carry out the grave mission entrusted to you.
Please accept, Excellency, the expression of my deepest personal esteem and
be assured of my prayers for all your family.
Most devotedly yours in the Lord,
Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer
Rome, May
23, 1958
I did find in my own research that Opus Dei were more than incidental in the
Franco regime and helped with the financial organizing of the regimes
political desires.
It was Opus Dei members who were in charge of the
Ministries of Finance to such an extent that some Spanish writers called
them the Spanish Mafia.
The one question I still have though, is why does it appear on the surface
that secret societies such as the Freemasons seem to be against the Catholic
Church, and vice versa, when all along they are connected?
The answer can only be, that to win a football game, you need to back both
sides. By appearing to be against the Masons, you ensure that your side
remains loyal. But by owning the other team, in this case the Masons, you
get to hear and control all of those who are truly against you!
A trip down the Internet boulevard will give you a whole host of weird and
wonderful theories from the Masons infiltrate the Catholic Church to the
Pope is a reptile.
Whichever you end up believing, ask the following
questions:
-
What possible gain is there?
-
Who controls the most?
-
How long has this been going on?
-
Have the proven methods of manipulation and control used in the past been
only used once?
History is more than just the words on the page. It is more than some
documentary on TV. History is the stark reality of mankinds cyclical
nature. What we did before, we shall do again.
All I can say is, watch this
space, for man shall inevitably repeat his mistakes
