Here is a detailed presentation on what is really in
Agenda 21 and the
sustainable development movement as defined by
the United
Nations. How it will
ultimately compromise your property rights..
Regarding Ms. Bruntdland:
Some have suggested she is merely a Democrat and I
am way off base.
First off, Norway does not have a Democratic Party, but
rather Socialist democrats. Hopefully there is a difference. Internet
research can be a challenge, so I respect those who engage in it! However,
check out the XX Congress of the Socialist International in NY.
Gro was the
first VP of the Socialist International whose goal is to interact with
labour, social democrats and socialists worldwide to spread the socialist
concept of democracy. It is quite possible to be member of the Democratic
Party and a Socialist at the same time.
It is members like Gro whose desire
it is to move the Democratic party more toward the Social Democratic Party.
I also want to thank "6or8pack" for pointing out my error in mentioning that
Betty Perry's nose was injured by handcuffs.
In fact, she slipped during her
interaction with officers and hit her nose on the steps. Betty was aware of
local ordinances, but chose to ignore them. This landed her in the holding
pen. This error is mine.
Some have suggested they have "read Agenda 21" and there is nothing
dangerous in the book and besides, the document has no power to override
their Constitutional right to own and control private property.
To read the book alone, without reading the proceeding and following
documentation and activities would be somewhat like looking at a map of
Brazil and feeling you now know how Brazilians think and feel.
The name A21 refers not only to the actual book, but to the entire
sustainable development movement as defined by the United Nations dating
back to the 1970's through today. That is why it is important to not only
listen to the entire video, but research on your own to gain more
information.
Since this presentation was completed vast new volumes of
information have been compiled. Check the sources in the back of the
presentation and the United Nation's own websites to draw your own
conclusions.
