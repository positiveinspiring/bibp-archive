There was an 8-minute highly intense gun-fight
last week as
Khazarian agents attempted to steal codes
for the new financial system from a
White Dragon Society representative.
The attack was repelled at which point the
Khazarians contacted the Japanese Prime Ministers office saying their
agents had infiltrated security at nuclear plants in Japan and threatened a
nuclear holocaust if they were not given control over the new financial
system. Their patently false cover story for the threatened sabotage was
that Japan was selling plutonium to Iran.
They were told instead to quickly cut a deal
with the Palestinians or else find themselves with no friends anywhere on
the planet.
The pentagon and U.S. intelligence establishment is now mostly in support of
the White Dragon Society but only if certain conditions of theirs are met, a
U.S. representative told the WDS.
The Pentagon wants Obama to remain as president.
They also want a debt jubilee and a gold backed dollar. They also support
the projects to turn the deserts green and replenish the oceans with fish.
The pentagon and the agencies also say that if their conditions are not met,
they will open the black screens and reveal information that will lead to
thousands of arrests.
These positions will be discussed at a meeting
in China later this week.
The Pentagon seems to be trying to strengthen its bargaining position by
heating up disputes in places like Vietnam and Korea. They are also, of
course, still keeping open the threat to close off the straits of Hormuz.
This is all just for bargaining purposes.
What the Western Oligarchs need to remember, as they battle over control
of the global debt facility, is that above the global debt facility is
something known as the global credit facility. The ability to create
new dollars and Euros out of the ether and put them into bank computers is
meaningless unless these currency units are actually backed by something
that exists in the real world.
In other words, right now world annual GDP is
worth about $60 trillion and yet these banks claim to have a 1 with 46 zeros
after it amount of dollars in their accounts. Clearly a lot of those zeroes
will have to be erased if the Western financial system is to return to
reality.
The Chinese proposal to use a basket of 30 or so commodities, including gold
and platinum, to back these currencies, makes sense. The Americans also need
to realize that they will not be able to rebuild a competitive industrial
structure unless they decouple their own national currency from the
international currency now known as the U.S. dollar.
The devaluation would lead to a temporary drop
in international purchasing power but the boom set off by the civilian
development of some of the 6,000 patents now suppressed for national
security reasons, would make this a very quick adjustment prior to a new
boom-time.
The Mediterranean countries like Greece, Italy and Spain probably also need
to issue their own currency. Without a unified work ethic and fiscal policy,
a unified currency does not work. A cheap Mediterranean currency would boost
tourism and exports and lead to real economic improvements.
Endless bail outs will only kick the can down the road a bit more but result
in greater ultimate pain.
Meanwhile, a bank account for the White Dragon Foundation has been approved
and the WDF will solicit institutional donations to be used towards the
establishment of an international economic planning agency.
The agency would carry out long term economic development projects too large
for individual governments or corporations to carry out. This would be a
meritocratically staffed agency. It would complement rather than replace
functions now carried out by
the IMF and
the World Bank. These institutions, of
course, will need to undergo a major audit and change in culture.
The Chinese have now begun to back Agustin Carstens, the Mexican
central bank governor, as the new head of the IMF.
They correctly argue that since the next big IMF
bailout will be to help Europe, there would be a conflict of interest if a
European was put at its head at this time. Carstens also supports a reform
of the voting structure at the IMF to reflect current, as opposed to
post-World War 2, economic realities.
The timing for the announcement of the new financial system is still not
clear. There is still some very serious horse-trading, accompanied by
nuclear blackmail etc. going on in the background. However, the summer
solstice and a full lunar eclipse will coincide on June 21st so
that might be an auspicious day for an announcement.
It is best not to get too fixated on dates
though.
