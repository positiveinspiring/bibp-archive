President inviting
slave-trading countries
to join trade agreement TPP
Not long after the White House invited Thailand to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the AP reported the country was relying on slave labor to ship shrimp to the U.S.
And it's unlikely Thailand's billion-dollar slave industry would prevent it from joining the TPP considering that Obama previously removed an anti-slavery provision from the TPP and also allowed Vietnam to join the partnership despite its flourishing slave trade.
"For 16 hours, No. 31 and his wife stood in the factory that owned them with their aching hands in ice water," the AP revealed. "They ripped the guts, heads, tails and shells off shrimp bound for overseas markets, including grocery stores and all-you-can-eat buffets across the United States."

"After being sold to the Gig Peeling Factory, they were at the mercy of their Thai bosses, trapped with nearly 100 other Burmese migrants."
It was only in Oct. that the Obama administration invited Thailand to join the TPP "with open arms."
"The United States 'would welcome with open arms' Thailand's ruling junta wanting the country to participate in the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact without waiting for the return of a full democratic government to the country, the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Thailand said," the Bangkok Post reported.
Thailand has been under a military dictatorship with severe restrictions on free speech since 2014, and if that won't stop the White House from inviting the country to join the TPP, the slavery in Thailand won't either.
Remember it was President Obama who quietly removed an anti-slavery provision from the TPP in June while he was publicly attacking the Confederate flag as a "symbol of slavery."
"The provision, which bars countries that engage in slavery from being part of major trade deals with the U.S., was written by Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.)," the Huffington Post reported in May. "At the insistence of the White House, Menendez agreed to modify his language to say that as long as a country is taking 'concrete' steps toward reducing human trafficking and forced labor, it can be part of a trade deal."
