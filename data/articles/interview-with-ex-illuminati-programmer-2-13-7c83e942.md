Q: Svali, what role does and will the
UN play in the future and how
do you see this unfolding? What is their timeline?
A: The
UN was created early in this century in order to help
overcome one of the biggest barriers to a one world government
necessary, if there is to be a military rule and dictatorship by the
Illuminists. That barrier is the one of nationalism, or pride in
one's country. This is why it was NOT a popular concept when first
introduced, it took years of country bashing in the media and the
destruction of any sense of national pride by a (not so subtle)
media campaign over the years.
It's agenda? It is set up as a shadow, or forerunner, of the
Supreme
World Council that will represent every nation. Every ambassador to
the UN has either done something to curry Illuminati favor and been
rewarded, or is a political figurehead chosen to make the
organization "look good".
The Illuminati and governmental leaders chose to create the UN early
in the past century, and worked hard and against opposition to put
it in place (FDR was their man in America who helped the American
public accept it). Both he and Eleanor were staunch Illuminists. So
is Shirley Temple Black. In fact, most of our presidents since the
beginning of the past century have been either Illuminists, or
agreed by oath to support their goals, in return for campaign funds
and support. I believe it is impossible to win a presidential
election in our country today without their backing. The Kennedy
family were punished because they tried to disobey them. They were
free thinkers, and too hard to "control".
The UN has a stated goal of world peace, and wants to incorporate
under its fold military and peace-keeping functions. But in reality,
giving this role to the UN weakens the individual military strength
of nations, and encourages them to lean more and more on an external
organization, making them less able to resist when the takeover
occurs.
I was told that by the year 2020, that the New Order would be openly
revealed, BUT that may have been cult propaganda, and they are
always changing dates. I personally believe that by the mid of this
century, they will reveal themselves. This is just my opinion,
though.
Q: What are the plans of
the Illuminati for the
Middle East and how
will it affect the rest of the world? Will we see WWIII?
A: The conflict in the middle east is only to the advantage of the
Illuminists. They HATE Israel, and hope one day to see it destroyed,
and are biding their time. One of the olive branches offered by the
UN when it takes over is that they will prevent war in the middle
east, and this will be greeted with joy by many.
At the same time,
the Illuminati covertly supply guns and funds to
BOTH sides to keep the conflict fueled. They are very duplicious
people. They used to funnel guns through the USSR to Palestine, for
example, in the name of promoting "friendliness" between the USSR
and this state and other arab nations. Then, the US Illuminists
would help funnel guns to Israel, for the same reason.
These people love the game of chess, and see warfare between nations
as creating an order out of chaos. The USSR is going to get stronger
again. It has too strong a military both openly, and covertly (ALL
Illuminati military trainers have visited Russia to learn from them)
to sit quietly and quiesciently to the side. In the NWO, they will
be stronger than us.
Want to hear the end of the world scenario
the Illuminati taught me?
It was cult propaganda, but this is how they believed the New Order
would be ushered in:
-
There will be continued conflict in the mideast, with a severe
threat of nuclear war being the culmination of these hostilities.
-
An economic collapse that will devastate the economy of the
US and
Europe, much like the great depression.
-
One reason that our economy continues limping along is the
artificial supports that the
Federal Reserve had given it,
manipulating interest rates, etc.
-
But one day, this won't work (or
this leverage will be withdrawn on purpose) and the next great
depression will hit.
-
The government will call in its bonds and
loans, and credit card debts will be called in.
-
There will be
massive bankruptcies nationwide.
-
Europe will stabilize first, and
Germany, France and England (surprise) will have the strongest
economies, and will institute through the UN an international
currency.
-
Japan will also pull out, although their economy will be
weakened.
-
Peacekeeping forces will be sent out by the
UN and local bases to
prevent riots.
-
The leaders will reveal themselves, and people will
be asked to make a pledge of loyalty during a time of chaos and
financial devastation.
Doesn't sound pleasant, does it? I don't know the exact time frame
for all of this, and wouldn't want to even guess. The good news is
that if a person is debt-free, owes nothing to the government or
credit debt, and can live self sufficiently, they may do better than
other. I would invest in gold, not stocks, if I had the income. Gold
will once again be the world standard, and dollars will be pretty
useless (remember after the Civil War? Our money will be worth about
what confederate money was after the collapse).
All this said, it could just be cult propaganda taught to me and
others to frighten us. It may be that none of this will happen. I
sincerely hope not. I also strongly believe that God is able to stay
the hand of the wicked, and to take care of our nation and others,
if we turn to Him.
Q: Overall, would you say the Illuminati are racist? I am asking
this because their agenda seems to be very white supremist
throughout history.
A:
The Illuminati are racist, and have a very "aryan" outlook. They
believe strongly in the rule of the "pure" and "intelligent" by
their definitions, and in their ceremonies, there will occasionally
be minorities killed in ceremonies.
They are trying to breed
a "genetically superior" race to rule, with their children and
descendants. In their
Utopia, the
intelligentsia will rule, and the sheep like masses will follow
their leaders (that is their view of the world; that the occult
leaders are "enlightened' and intelligent, while the average person
is a "sheep" to be led by the nose).
Q: Why would they allow a black leader to head the
UN?
A: Because it is a temporarily politically expedient thing for them
to do. They are liars, and will hold out a hand to a popular
political figure, throwing them a figurehead role in one of their
organizations, to make the UN look better, and as a group that
promotes "interracial harmony" and "unity" and "peace".
The real leaders would never publicly allow their real feelings to
show. The UN is a preparation, but it is not the real power in the
world, and will be relatively unimportant when the NWO comes into
being. The real councils will then step forward. But as a means of
getting the general public to accept the idea of a "global
community" and the "one world community" the UN is a stepping stone
in their working towards the
NWO.
Q: Do they have a population control agenda? I'm thinking specially
in view of the AIDS plague in Africa. Could this be engineered by
them?
A: I have heard reports that certain deadly viruses have been
engineered by the Illuminati, but I doubt that HIV was. Why? Because
so many of the leadership of the Illuminati are blatantly pedophilic
and homosexual, the virus is rampant in parts of the US, and they
would be endangering themselves as well. Most of the leadership that
I knew were homosexuals in their night personas (myself included)
and it was accepted as a lifestyle in that setting, and encouraged.
Also, the viruses that they are developing are ones that they are
also engineering antidotes to, to protect leadership from the virus
if an epidemic breaks out. I do know that there is some working on
biological weapons by members of this group as a method of
threatening population bases that don't embrace the "New Order" when
revealed, this was discussed occasionally in leadership meetings.
What state it is at at this time, I couldn't say, since it has been
several years since I was active in the group.
