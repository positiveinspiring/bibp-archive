Over the past week, as Invisible Children and their corporate sponsors performed desperate damage control, ties between the alleged "charity" and,
the US State Department Wall Street speculator George Soros and his Open Society Institute,
the US State Department
Wall Street speculator George Soros and his Open Society Institute,
and a myriad of corporate-funded foundations began surfacing and spreading just as quickly as their documentary Kony 2012 rose to fame.
A visual representation of
Invisible Children's true backers and master minds.
They will gladly shed their front group
in the name of self-preservation and making a clean escape.

Perhaps most importantly, the term AFRICOM began gaining wider notoriety as did the mission of AFRICOM - the neo-colonial plundering of all of Africa:
And as this single backfiring propaganda stunt threatened to unhinge a continent-spanning corporate-military industrial campaign, the plug was abruptly pulled with news of Invisible Children's director Jason Russell being arrested for lewd behavior in public.
The BSAC was a company chartered by the British Empire, lent the resources and capabilities of the Empire, to help loot the natural wealth of Africa.
This mirrors exactly AFRICOM and the legion of corporations and NGOs carrying out the modern-day looting of Africa. Note the terms "justice" and "freedom" used upon the company's coat of arms:
The coat of arms of the British South Africa Company (BSAC)
a predecessor of modern neo-imperialism.
Clearly masking exploitation with good intentions is nothing new. The growing legions of critics and skeptics arrayed against this latest Wall Street-London psychological operation will undoubtedly seize this irresistible bait laid out, either by chance or by design, to focus on finishing off the already mortally wounded "Invisible Children" organization.
It is already turning out to be a spectacular crash and burn.

However, the focus must be maintained on the mechanics behind Invisible Children, the fact that they are backed by USAID and that they participated in the US State Department's Alliance for Youth Movements (Movements.org) summits which laid the groundwork years in advance for the US-engineered "Arab Spring."
It must also be remembered that while they pretend to be a movement of the people, Invisible Children is in fact backed by (page 22) Soros-funded foundations, JP Morgan, Chase, and others. And as satisfying as many will find it to stomp Invisible Children out of existence for intentionally misleading them, preying on their emotions, insulting their intelligence, and literally lying to them, they must remember that all they've managed to do is hack away but a tentacle of a much larger monster.
While we have a firm grip on Invisible Children, let's pull up the whole monster from its murky lair. Let us expose the International Criminal Court and its fraudulent head, Luis Moreno-Ocampo who enthusiastically supported the fraud that is Kony 2012.
And the Hollywood propagandists who abused their fame and the misplaced trust of millions to promote Invisible Children, as well as other, more established but equally fraudulent NGOs like Soros-funded (annual report page 8) Amnesty International and the Neo-Con run, Freedom House, who skillfully rode the wave of publicity Invisible Children created, but ran concurrent anti-Kony/pro-AFRICOM invasion campaigns of their own, safely isolated from what they knew was experimental, unpredictable, and potentially disastrous propaganda. As the plug is pulled on Invisible Children, the system will gladly sacrifice an easily replaceable tentacle in exchange for its overall self-preservation.
Do not allow the writhing tentacle pulled into the boat distract us from the grander prize at hand.
KONY 2012 Psy-Op Collapsing
March 14, 2012 from ActivistPost Website
Invisible Children disables comments on viral propaganda video + meet the real Joseph Kony.
As the US State Department, USAID-centric Invisible Children psy-op KONY 2012 collapses, Invisible Children has disabled comments on their viral YouTube video (see video far below.) When last checked, negative comments were voted to the top and a cascading effect of skepticism as well as damning facts began drowning out the initial confusion, sympathy, and emotional knee-jerk support the propaganda video purposefully created and preyed upon.
A screenshot of Invisible Children's Kony 2012 video on YouTube.
Comments have been disabled.
As comments are now being censored (above image), it is suggested that people simply go to the video and click the "dislike" button to voice their opposition to this stunt.
Most likely, even that feature will be disabled, and the video KONY 2012 will become the one-way Wall Street infomercial it really is, rather than the faux-participatory "social media" "activism 2.0" experience it masquerades as being.
The Establishment-Funded "Anti-Establishment" Charity It has been revealed that indeed Invisible Children has been working with USAID, a US government agency that helps lay the groundwork for what could best be described as a modern-day imperial administrative network.
It is now also revealed that Invisible Children attended the 2010 US State Department and Fortune 500 sponsored Alliance for Youth Movements (AYM) summit in London. AYM (also called Movements.org) it was reported, played a central role in preparing armies of US State Department funded, trained, and equipped activists to carry out the so-called "Arab Spring" years in advance.
Much like KONY 2012, the Arab Spring took many by surprise and in the wave of confusion, entire nations were upturned and US proxy regimes installed. Tunisia and Libya are now full-fledged client states of Wall Street and London, while the fates of nations like Egypt and Syria still hang in the balance. Unlike the "Arab Spring" however, the KONY 2012 scam has collapsed almost as fast as it first swept the globe.
And as it falls, it is taking with it the credibility of all who participated in it and promoted it, including the deceitful International Criminal Court (ICC) and its chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo, as well as Hollywood and the corporate-media who did all in their power to lie, manipulate and make fools out of millions once more in the pursuit of perpetuating the imperial ambitions of Wall Street and London.
KONY 2012 is Casus Belli for Emptying Out Africa It was reported in "Libyan Rebels Inspired by Globalization" that US-proxy rebel leader, Gibril (Jabril) Elwarfally before the Fortune 500-funded Brookings Institution, would claim Libya's role in the future was to transition to a service economy, focus on education, and turn Libya into a lake to develop the skills of Africans to serve the needs of the European Union.
If Africa is a treasure trove of resources, Libya will be the doorway through which the West loots it. And as the West breaks down the door in North Africa, US Africa Command (AFRICOM) has been concurrently deploying military assets throughout Africa, from Nigeria, across Central and East Africa and southward toward Kenya and even as far as to menace the former British holding of Rhodesia, now known as Zimbabwe. It has been reported already that in Uganda British firms have participated in land grabs violently displacing up to 30,000 people in single transactions in direct cooperation with Ugandan dictator-for-life Yoweri Museveni.
In fact, it is troops under Museveni's command, who helped displace these people, and who stand to receive additional weapons and funds from Invisible Children's KONY 2012 campaign.
Meeting Joseph Kony A rare interview with Joseph Kony, leader of the Lord's Resistance Army. Kony would state that he and his men were "freedom fighters," and that, "we are fighting for democracy. We should be free to elect our leader. We want our leader to be elected," as opposed to the current reigning dictator of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power for nearly 3 decades.
Meeting Joseph Kony
A rare interview with Joseph Kony, leader of the Lord's Resistance Army.
Kony would state that he and his men were "freedom fighters,"
and that, "we are fighting for democracy.
We should be free to elect our leader.
We want our leader to be elected," as opposed
to the current reigning dictator of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni,
who has been in power for nearly 3 decades.
While researching this article, a rare interview with Joseph Kony himself was found (above video.)
Kony states that his fight is against Ugandan President Museveni, who by any definition is indeed a tyrannical, mass murdering dictator. Kony states that he is actually a "freedom fighter" fighting for "democracy."
With talk like that, it is a surprise that the US State Department isn't funding and arming him.
Ironically, recent reports indicate that the US may just have been, and that the West was funding and backing both Kony and Museveni to ensure that the entire region remained in constant turmoil.
The purpose of this from a geopolitical point-of-view is quite simple, as encapsulated in the following ancient Chinese stratagem:
When a country is beset by internal conflicts, when disease and famine ravage the population, when corruption and crime are rampant, then it will be unable to deal with an outside threat. This is the time to attack. The 36 Strategies, #5 Loot a Burning House
When a country is beset by internal conflicts, when disease and famine ravage the population, when corruption and crime are rampant, then it will be unable to deal with an outside threat. This is the time to attack.
The 36 Strategies, #5 Loot a Burning House
With US troops already on the ground in Uganda, as well as creeping across Africa under AFRICOM, the attack is already on.
Quite clearly further US troop deployments based on invoking renewed interest in Africa and the hunting of various "bogeymen" amidst an atmosphere of general chaos and lawlessness serves only to give the US free reign over the continent and eliminate any and all African leaders who insist on maintaining ties with China and/or their national sovereignty. The corporate-financier elite have calculated that public ignorance, even for nations as well-known as Iran, Syria, and Libya, is so profound that the media can peddle any narrative and still have the public believe it.
Building a manipulative mechanism, what Vigilant Citizen describes as, "State Propaganda for a New Generation," goes beyond just Uganda and Joseph Kony.
It represents a model that can be turned against virtually any country in Africa, or even around the world. It represents a new stage in manipulating the minds and hearts of the global population by leveraging so-called social media, more accurately described as "Propaganda 2.0."
Exposing and burying this new method of manipulation is the key to bringing forth a real revolution.

KONY 2012 is a film and campaign by Invisible Children that aims to make Joseph Kony famous, not to celebrate him, but to raise support for his arrest and set a precedent for international justice.
