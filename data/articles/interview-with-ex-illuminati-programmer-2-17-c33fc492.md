Q: Svali, can you tell me what sort of incredible powers and
abilities the brain is capable of, what you have seen and heard
while you were still part of the Illuminati? I'm sure a photographic
memory is only part of it?
A: Research shows that we use only a part of the brain's
ability, and the Illuminati and other occult groups are well aware
of this. This is why a planned program of early stimulation and
training is purposely done, to encourage children to begin using
this normally "unused portion" of the brain.
A photographic memory is developed in a trance state. A person under
hypnosis will have almost complete recall of events, and details
around them. The brain never loses anything, it is just that in
daily life, we filter out information to allow normal function,
otherwise our senses would be bombarded, and we would be constantly
distracted.
Hypnotic induction can override this filter when the suggestion is
implanted. The person then "downloads" information and details to
the trainer. Other abilities that can be developed include:
-
Learning foreign languages:
Children are taught three, four, or five and more languages
based on aptitude
-
Physical strength: the child
can do more physically than a child his/her age normally could
-
Psychic ability: this is considered a valued asset, and is worked
on
Children learn to pick up objects, using
telekenetic powers, and to
use their mind to "read people" (have information about the person
that they could not possibly know), travel through time, and/or
through spiritual dimensions, and even to be able to "psychically
kill" an animal (or human) without touching them. Out of body
travel, where the child can visit a room, describe what is there,
and details of conversations, is also done.
The child will be taught to have above normal intelligence, usually
in the range of 120 (minimum) to above 200. IQs of 160 and above are
NOT uncommon in this group. The specific abilities developed will
depend upon the child (or adult's) role, or planned role in the
group.
Q: Svali, currently there is a popular TV series airing, called
The
Pretender. Now after you told me so much about the Illuminati this
show is starting to make a lot more sense to me. Perhaps this show
is even based on MK Ultra or Illuminati history.
A: I have never watched this show, because the first two minutes
(the prequel) triggered me so badly several years ago, I had to get
up and leave the room. I later told my husband, "I can't believe
they are showing this openly on TV.'' Yes, it is directly based on
mind control programming, etc. and is a direct, blatant show. But in
our society, based on denial, this is considered "fiction", except
to those who have undergone this type of training.
Q: Could any of this mindcontrol technology be used for positive
purposes, enhancing mental powers, without actually losing control
over one's own mind? A few year ago there was a fad about so-called
mind machines, with flashing lights and sounds, which included VR
glasses and headphones. What do you know about those mind machines?
Do they work?
A: I don't know of any mindcontrol technology that I believe is
good, sorry. Why? Even if it doesn't involve trauma (and most DOES),
if equipment like this were in the wrong hands, it would always be
used to subjugate and control others. Unfortunately, that is the
"Control" part of mind control: someone else is in charge, using the
other person. Most of the machines and VR stuff don't really work,
because in order for MC to work, the person has to be young to
develop those abilities, and also traumatized. This is a sad fact.
Also, many if not most of the abilities developed are harmful and
destructive. The spiritual travel and time travel always exact a
price, and slowly will kill or destroy the person if engaged in too
often. I have seen 'Spiritual' in the Illuminati who did this, and
they had completely white hair by the age of 22! Most 'Spiritual'
grey early, because the physical and psychological destruction are
so great. Even the Illuminists are aware of this, and prevent too
much work in one area for this reason.
The demonic behind it has caused some people (like
Crowly, for
example) to eventually end life insane. I can't recommend it for
anyone, it would be like playing with fire, or a dangerous weapon.
This is one reason I refuse to have anything to do with this type of
stuff. I renounced and closed all spiritual doors in my life years
ago, and can no longer "read" people, or do psychic travel, or speak
5 languages. I am so happy to NOT have these abilities now, since my
life belongs to Jesus, and that is ten times better. He is enhancing
my life in much better ways.
Q: Can you tell us a bit more about the psychic part, such as
telepathy, telekinesis, time travel, etc. What is each of those
abilities used for by the Illuminati?
A: First, it's important to realize that when a person does time
travel, they are often in an altered state of consciousness. They
leave their body behind, and travel in the spiritual realm. People I
have been with who were travelling looked as if they were in a deep
trance state or coma: their breathing is slow, their skin pale and
cool, and their heartbeat is lowered. There was always a ritual or a
sacrifice first to open the portal. The first few times, a person
always takes someone else to guide them and teach them and help them
come back. It was always filled with anxiety, because if a person
got "lost" they might stay there and not come back to now.
I also hated it, and I believe it is demonically driven and
forbidden by scripture, that is one reason I don't like remembering
it. It was almost always into the past, in fact, there was a barrier
up so a person couldn't go too far into the future (maybe a day or
so). I don't know why the barrier is there, I have no idea.
But there is no barrier to going into the past, and people do it for
several reasons: to see history to ask wisdom from people in the
past/ advice/ help to teach others to demonstrate the unbroken
"gloriousness" of the group. I have seen rituals at ancient
Stonehenge (yes, it was used for that) from 1000 years ago doing
this, and visited the courts of the monarchies doing this. BUT I
also believe it is all deception, a falseness done by the demonic,
and that any information obtained by this method is absolutely not
reliable. A person could only travel for short periods, they weren't
allowed to do more, since it causes health and psychologocal
problems. This kind of stuff is very very destructive.
Q: Can it be used to influence people, ie. politicians, businessmen,
military leaders etc. and to put certain thoughts into their minds?
A: Not that I saw. There is a limit to the influence of this
kind of stuff. Instead, these people get blackmailed or bribed,
which is much more effective. I believe that the ability of the
"psychic phenomena" is overrated at times, since people do have free
will, unless they are being in active control by the group.
Q: To what degree can they alter global consciousness and our
timeline by time/ astral travel in general and how many people would
be needed to do that?
A: They don't try. Remember, God is in control of history, not
the Illuminati or any other group.
Q: Does the Illuminati have 'specialists' with this sort of ability
and are they used 'fulltime' to do this?
A: They have people that do this more, called "Spiritual" (the
ones who specialize in spiritual, instead of Military, or Sciences,
or Scholarship). These people ALWAYS age before their time, and have
grey or white hair early. Even they have to limit their contact with
this, since it is so destructive.
Some of this also comes under the heading "theta" programming, or
psychic programming. Remember in the movie The Matrix, the children
learning to bend spoons? That was pure theta being shown, and
horrified me to watch. Again, Hollywood goes above ground. These
abilities are used to teach "psychic killing" (I have seen animals
killed by people in a ring around it, concentrating on it, the
animal rose up and was strangled), and to supposedly do this to
humans, or to be able to eavesdrop on others.
This is NOT a safe, new dimension that has been discovered. It is
demons influencing human beings and sharing their knowledge with
them. And it always ends up destroying those involved in it for very
long or very heavily. The demonic wants to destroy the human race,
since we are so beloved of God, and they hate Him and us, His
beloved creation.
Things such as astral travel, time travel are addressed in the Bible
(it's called "spiritism", "witchcraft", etc.) and were forbidden for
a good reason: to protect us. I have heard of people who never came
back, died, or lost their minds after doing the things I mention,
and I would never, ever advocate exploring it, when life here on
earth is so full of good things to know about that aren't
destructive.
I am so glad that I no longer have to witness these things or be
part of them, I have renounced ever being part of this in my own
life, and closed all doors to the demonic and its activity. I also
lost all of these abilities at the same time, and it is a huge
relief.
