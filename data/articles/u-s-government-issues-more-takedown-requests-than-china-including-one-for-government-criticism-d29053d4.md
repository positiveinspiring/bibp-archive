It is now an indisputable fact that the United
States is attempting to control the internet through censorship; in fact the
U.S. issued more content removal requests to Google than China, which is
regularly criticized in America for their draconian internet policies.
While
China issued 3 content removal requests
from January to June 2011 for a total of 121 items to be removed,
the United States issued a whopping 92 requests
with a total of 757 items requested to be removed.
The disturbing part is not just the sheer number of requests and the
compliance rate of 63%, but also the plethora of reasons given for the
takedown requests.
The most popular reason given by what Google classifies as Executive,
Police, etc. (meaning police and any one of the many agencies that falls
under the executive branch) is Privacy and Security with 13 requests.
Defamation is the most popular reason given by court orders, with a total of
29 requests made, the vast majority of which were direct at web search
results.
The executive and police have made three requests due to so-called Hate
Speech, two for Impersonation and Violence, along with one for
Government Criticism and one for National Security.
Both of the requests made for national security and government criticism
reasons were made due to videos on YouTube.
This begs the obvious question: in the United States, where we are supposed
to have free speech, what on earth is the government doing attempting to get
the largest search engine and video hosting site to censor items for
government criticism?
One would not be surprised if this was occurring under a totalitarian regime
elsewhere in the world but in America government criticism is a sacred right
protected by the Constitution and lauded by our forefathers.
A local law enforcement agency has requested that YouTube remove videos of
police brutality, although Google claims that they did not remove said
videos.
Another law enforcement agency requested that Google remove videos which
allegedly defamed law enforcement officers, which they also did not comply
with.
It is good to know that they did not kowtow to law enforcement for such
frivolous reasons, although the fact remains that our government is making a
concerted effort to fight free speech on the internet.
In this reporting period between January and June of 2011 the total number
of content removal requests received in the United States increased by a
staggering 70% over the previous period.
Similarly, the number of user data requests received in the United States
went up by 29% compared to the previous period.
This is noteworthy because 93% of user data requests are complied with fully
or partially. A total of 5,950 user data requests were made for a total of
11,057 users/accounts.
With a 93% compliance rate, that is roughly 5,533 filled user data requests
and a total of 10,283 users/accounts.
In a similar trend, the United Kingdom increased the number of requests by
71% compared to the previous reporting period and there videos including
government criticism have already been taken down or blocked within the UK.
Back in May of this year, the British government - with YouTubes help -
censored footage of the British
Constitution Groups Lawful Rebellion protest.
During the protest, the activists attempted to civilly and symbolically
arrest Judge Michael Peake at Birkenhead County Court.
The British Constitution Group protests what they consider to be the illegal
British council tax and Judge Peake was ruling on a case involving Roger
Hayes a former UKIP member who refused to pay council taxes.
Just like the United States, the United Kingdom has made the slow descent
into tyranny while continuing to pretend to be a bastion of hope and freedom
for the world.
It is laughable for the illegitimate American government to continue the
charade that is democracy in the United States given their flexing of
dictatorial powers, especially when it comes to the internet.
All one must do is look at the fact that Chinese takedown requests pale in
comparison to the United State to see the total destruction of what America
is supposed to stand for.
Ordering the takedown of a video over government criticism is something I
hoped I would never see in the United States but it is clear that we are so
far gone at this point that almost anything is possible.
Without the American people getting vocal over issues like this and standing
up for our rights we can bet that the government will continue to erode our
freedoms with a vengeance.
