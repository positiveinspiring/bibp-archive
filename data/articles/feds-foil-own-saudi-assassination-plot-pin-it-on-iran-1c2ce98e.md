"...it would be far more preferable if the United States could cite an
Iranian provocation as justification for the airstrikes before launching
them. Clearly, the more outrageous, the more deadly, and the more unprovoked
the Iranian action, the better off the United States would be.
Of course, it
would be very difficult for the United States to goad Iran into such a
provocation without the rest of the world recognizing this game, which would
then undermine it.
(One method that would have some possibility of success
would be to ratchet up covert regime change efforts in the hope that Tehran
would retaliate overtly, or even semi-overtly, which could then be portrayed
as an unprovoked act of Iranian aggression.)
This suggests that this option might benefit from being held in abeyance
until such time as the Iranians made an appropriately provocative move, as
they do from time to time. In that case, it would be less a determined
policy to employ airstrikes and instead more of an opportunistic hope that
Iran would provide the United States with the kind of provocation that would
justify airstrikes.
However, that would mean that the use of airstrikes
could not be the primary U.S. policy toward Iran (even if it were
Washingtons fervent preference), but merely an ancillary contingency to
another option that would be the primary policy unless and until Iran
provided the necessary pretext."
page 84-85 of "Which Path to Persia?"
Brookings Institution, 2009.
Apparently, manufacturing such a "necessary pretext" to unilaterally bomb a
nation of 70 million is now also a part of U.S. foreign policy toward Iran.
An oafish fabrication announced this week by Attorney General Eric Holder,
consisted of an Iranian-American used-car salesman that "allegedly"
attempted to hire an undercover U.S. DEA agent, posing as a Mexican Los Zetas
gangster, to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the U.S.
U.S. Secretary of
State
Hillary Clinton would
add,
"nobody could make that up, right?"
Wrong.
The Fortune 500-funded U.S. policy think-tank, Brookings Institution, in 2009
made it quite clear that the U.S. would pursue its interests across the Middle
East and would not tolerate a strong, assertive Iran standing in the way.
Brookings would acknowledge in their report, however, that Iran sought
neither to confront the United States militarily, nor desired to provoke the
West into attacking the Islamic Republic, and even declared that Iran's
nuclear threat was more the deterrence it would present toward future U.S.
acts of aggression rather than hyped claims of proliferation or unilateral
first-strikes.
Many of the enumerated options explored in the Brookings report for
destabilizing and overthrowing the Iranian government had already been in
the process of being carried out even before the report was published in
2009.
This included funding, arming, and training U.S. State Department-listed
foreign terrorist organization (#28 on the list), Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK.)
To date, covert support, weapons and funding have already made it
into MEK's
hands, and select members of the terrorist organization have even received
specialized
training on U.S. soil.
U.S. policy makers, after admitting MEK had
the blood of U.S. soldiers and civilians on its hands and that it has
"undeniably" conducted terrorist attacks, shockingly
wants to remove it from
the U.S. foreign terrorist organization list so that it can be worked with
more closely in toppling the Iranian government.
Below, Brookings clearly authored this policy now being fully executed:
"Perhaps the most prominent (and certainly the most controversial)
opposition group that has attracted attention as a potential U.S. proxy is
the NCRI (National Council of Resistance of Iran), the political movement
established by the MEK (Mujahedin-e Khalq). Critics believe the group to be
undemocratic and unpopular, and indeed anti-American.
In contrast, the groups champions contend that the movements long-standing
opposition to the Iranian regime and record of successful attacks on and
intelligence-gathering operations against the regime make it worthy of U.S.
support. They also argue that the group is no longer anti-American and
question the merit of earlier accusations.
Raymond Tanter, one of the
groups supporters in the United States, contends that the MEK and the NCRI
are allies for regime change in Tehran and also act as a useful proxy for
gathering intelligence. The MEKs greatest intelligence coup was the
provision of intelligence in 2002 that led to the discovery of a secret site
in Iran for enriching uranium.
Despite its defenders claims, the MEK remains on the U.S. government list
of foreign terrorist organizations. In the 1970s, the group killed three
U.S. officers and three civilian contractors in Iran. During the 1979-1980
hostage crisis, the group praised the decision to take America hostages and
Elaine Sciolino reported that while group leaders publicly condemned the
9/11 attacks, within the group celebrations were widespread.
Undeniably, the group has conducted terrorist attacks - often excused by the
MEKs advocates because they are directed against the Iranian government.
For example, in 1981, the group bombed the headquarters of the Islamic
Republic Party, which was then the clerical leaderships main political
organization, killing an estimated 70 senior officials. More recently, the
group has claimed credit for over a dozen mortar attacks, assassinations,
and other assaults on Iranian civilian and military targets between 1998 and
2001.
At the very least, to work more closely with the group (at least in an
overt manner), Washington would need to remove it from the list of foreign
terrorist organizations."

Path to Persia?" Brookings
Institution, 2009
While Attorney General Eric Holder feigns outrage over Iran's "alleged" role
in an "alleged" bombing plot, and its violation of "international norms," it
turns out that the U.S. has been in reality, carrying out just such a campaign
of armed terror on Iranian soil for years.
Adding insult to injury,
Eric
Holder is currently under investigation for
his role in running thousands of
military-grade weapons over the U.S.-Mexican border, where they were used by
mass-murdering drug gangs to terrorize people across Mexico and even to
kill
U.S. agents.
One might wonder how many "international norms" that has
violated.
-
That the current "alleged" plot pinned on Iran revolves around yet another
undercover federal agency conducting a long-term sting operation defies
belief.
-
That we are expected to believe one of Iran's most elite military
forces left such a sensitive, potentially war-starting operation to a
used-car salesman and a drug gang reported in the papers daily for its
involvement with U.S. government agencies (and who turns out to actually be
undercover DEA agents) is so ridiculous it can only be "made up" as
Secretary Clinton puts it.
More accurately, it is the result of an impotent
U.S. intelligence community incapable of contriving anything more convincing
in the face of an ever awakening American public, to bolster its morally
destitute agenda.
The cartoonish nature of the plot and the arms' length
even its proponents treat it with to maintain plausible deniability is
indicative of a dangerously
out of control ruling elite and
an utterly
incompetent, criminally insane government.
It might be noted that this is yet another
example of a "terrorist plot" conjured up by federal agencies, hyped by
politicians and the media, and leveraged to propel foreign and domestic
policy the public and the world at large have already soundly rejected.
Two
other notable examples include the
Portland "Christmas Tree Bomber" used to
terrorize the city into rejoining the FBI's Joint Terror Task Force, and the
more recent "RC Plane Bomber" who was entrapped by FBI agents in order to
keep the fraud that is the "War on Terror" alive.
U.S. Policy Toward Iran...
One-Way Ticket to War

Kenneth Pollack helped literally co-author the
blueprints for America's current policy toward Iran.
Titled, "Which
Path to Persia?" and published in
2009 for the Fortune 500-funded Brookings Institution, much of what was
covered in the report had already gone operational before it hit the press.
This included,
While pundits in the media and politicians behind their podiums talk about
"extending hands," "carrots and sticks," and other trite, and ultimately
contrived policies the U.S. is supposedly pursuing in regards to Iran, there
is in reality only Brookings' plan - and it leads only to war.
Recently, Pollack penned a column for the Daily Beast titled, "Irans Covert
War Against the United States."
In it, Pollack, addressing a readership almost
assuredly ignorant of his work on "Which Path to Persia?," claims that Iran
appears to be irrationally wandering down a misguided path, waging what
might be a "covert war" against America, highlighted by the
contrived "Iran
terror plot" targeting a Saudi ambassador.
Pollack, a
former analyst for the CIA, seems to
humor the recent allegations against Iran as plausible despite his own
cautionary words regarding jumping to conclusions and despite the growing
factual basis that exists to entirely dismiss the plot.
Additionally, Pollack's feigned astonishment
over why Iran has been taking a tougher stance against the U.S. recently is a
case study in duplicity, as he was one of the chief architects of the
various provocations Washington has used to provoke Iran into such a stance.
Pollack's disingenuous editorial does however
lend us some insight into the current mindset of the "Which Path to Persia?"
co-authors, and ultimately into the mindset of those for whom the report was
prepared for and who are eager for war.
"Which
Path to Persia?"
Brookings Institution 2009
To understand American policy toward Iran, one
must understand who the authors are of such policy and what their
motivations are.
The Brookings Institution itself was created by
and for the corporate-financier elite. It is a policy think-tank that
represents the collective interests of the big oil corporations, banks, and
military contractors that fund it. Quite obviously then, policy toward Iran,
or any nation for that matter, from within the halls of the Brookings
Institution will revolve around expanding the global financial, social,
political, and military hegemony of its corporate sponsors.
Iran is a nation of 70 million, has a developed infrastructure, as well as a
tremendous wealth in natural resources, including oil and natural gas.
A Western-dominated banking system lording over
70 million people, telecommunications companies supplying services to this
vast population, and the immense consumerist troughs that could be laid out
before these people alone serves as a compelling incentive to attempt to
domineer Iran.
War against such a nation would be a trillion
dollar endeavor, utterly bankrupting the American people, but enriching the
military-industrial complex beyond imagination.
Of course, construction firms such as war-profiteering Halliburton and
Bechtel would make fortunes rebuilding amidst the destruction of such a vast
nation - as untold of billions have already been made by these same
corporations in Iraq, a nation with but a fraction of the land area and
population of Iran. Iran's oil fields flowing once again into the tankers,
pipelines, and coffers of Anglo-American oil companies also serves as an
attractive incentive, as do the geopolitical implications.
China would be essentially dependent entirely on oil controlled by the Wall
Street-London "international order," as would all nations.
The development of the modern nation-state is
dependent on energy. By controlling access to energy, one controls the
development of nations. While many analysts suggest the continental United
States contains enough energy to meet America's needs for the foreseeable
future, tapping into this supply and abandoning holdings overseas would
catapult the developing world into direct competition with America on almost
every front.
It would also allow nation-states worldwide to
defend themselves against what has essentially been a free reign of
financial piracy perpetrated by the,
Just some of Brookings
Institution's corporate & institutional financial sponsors.
For the full list (below
images) please see
Brookings' 2010 annual report, page 19.
It should be noted that many
of the managing directors, chairmen, and CEOs
of these corporations also
populate Brookings' Board of Directors producing a conflict of interests
of monstrous proportions.
Boycotting these corporations is an absolute necessity
for anyone seriously
interested in stopping the global corporate-financier elite's agenda.
With this in mind, it is quite clear why the
corporate-financier interests that fund Brookings have thrown their support
behind executing the recommendations made in "Which Path to Persia?" and
continue marching the United States ever closer to war with Iran.
The report itself, most likely never intended to
reach the American public on a large scale, and using language and length
inaccessible to the average "bread and circus" crowds, fully acknowledges
that Iran's leadership may be aggressive, but not reckless. The report also
notes that Iran would use its nuclear weapons only as an absolute last
resort, considering American and even Israeli nuclear deterrence
capabilities.
Even weapons ending up in the hands of non-state actors is
considered highly unlikely by the report.
Similar
reports out of the RAND corporation note that Iran has had chemical
weapons in its inventory for decades, and
other reports from RAND describe
the strict control elite military units exercise over these weapons, making
it unlikely they would end up in the hands of "terrorists."
The fact that Iran's extensive chemical weapon
stockpile has yet to be disseminated into the hands of non-state actors,
along with the fact that these same elite units would in turn handle any
Iranian nuclear weapons, lends further evidence to this conclusion.
Brookings notes on pages 24 and 25 of the report, that the real threat is
not the deployment of these weapons, but rather the deterrence they present,
allowing Iran to counter U.S. influence in the region without the fear of an
American invasion. In other words, the playing field would become level and
America may be forced to recognize Iran's national sovereignty in regards to
its own regional interests.
The report also acknowledges on multiple
occasions that Iran is not looking to provoke the West, and that the West,
or Israel would have to proactively work to provoke Iran into war instead.
In one breathtaking quote, the Brookings report states in regards to
initiating a large scale airstrike against Iran:
"...it would be far more preferable if the
United States could cite an Iranian provocation as justification for the
airstrikes before launching them. Clearly, the more outrageous, the more
deadly, and the more unprovoked the Iranian action, the better off the
United States would be.
Of course, it would be very difficult for
the United States to goad Iran into such a provocation without the rest
of the world recognizing this game, which would then undermine it.
(One method that would have some possibility
of success would be to ratchet up covert regime change efforts in the
hope that Tehran would retaliate overtly, or even semi-overtly, which
could then be portrayed as an unprovoked act of Iranian aggression.)"
This quote alone, not to mention the entire
content of this report, compiled by some of America's most prolific policy
makers and funded by America's largest corporations and banks,
demonstratively executed over the past several years, makes everything that
follows regarding the sanctions, covert military operations, U.S.-funded
uprisings, U.S.-funded terrorism via
the MEK (Mujahedin-e Khalq), and now
these most recent, entirely contrived allegations regarding a supposed
"bombing plot," all unjustified acts of war on America's behalf.
The reckless self-serving nature of this gambit
puts in danger the lives of hundreds of millions of people as these craven
megalomaniacs edge us ever closer to war with Iran.
Pollack, in his Daily Beast op-ed, seems to almost relish the converging
paths bringing us closer to war. While he fills his editorial with
disclaimers regarding the believability of the recent Iranian plot
allegations, his infinite duplicity is exhibited by omitting the role he has
played in developing policy designed to purposefully provoke a war with Iran
it had actively sought to avoid.
Should readers know this, they would not only
dismiss him as a meddling, treasonous, warmonger, but dismiss the latest
allegations against Iran as yet another contrived attempt to stoke the fires
of war.
Readers need to take a good look at Brookings' sponsors. These are the
people conspiring to send your sons and daughters, brothers and sisters,
mothers and fathers off to war. These are the people that intend to bleed
you dry financially as you pay them to wage a war you neither want nor will
benefit from.
These are the ones that will ultimately profit
while both America and Iran suffers immeasurably.
These corporations need to be put out of business, and instead of wringing
our hands and hoping for salvation from our clearly compromised,
corporate-fascist government, we can begin today by boycotting these
corporations and putting our money instead into local businesses,
entrepreneurship, and solutions that benefit we the people.
Even just beginning to boycott them, cutting
back in our daily life and working toward the eventual goal of complete
local self-sufficiency will scale down both the reach and ambitions of these
corporations. It will also spur change within, as sagging profits motivate
individuals within these corporations to abandon those advocating
exploitative, parasitic agendas and business models.
We can speak up to expose the fraud, speak out to stop the war, but it is
essential, above all, to begin changing the balance of power that has
allowed for our nation to be led to the edge of such a precipice in the
first place.
