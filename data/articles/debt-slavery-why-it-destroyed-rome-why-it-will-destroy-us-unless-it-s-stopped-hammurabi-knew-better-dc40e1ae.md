Book V of Aristotles
Politics describes the eternal transition
of oligarchies making themselves into hereditary aristocracies - which end
up being overthrown by tyrants or develop internal rivalries as some
families decide to take the multitude into their camp and usher in
democracy, within which an oligarchy emerges once again, followed by
aristocracy, democracy, and so on throughout history.
Debt has been the main dynamic driving these shifts - always with new twists
and turns. It polarizes wealth to create a creditor class, whose oligarchic
rule is ended as new leaders (tyrants to Aristotle) win popular support by
cancelling the debts and redistributing property or taking its usufruct for
the state.
Since the Renaissance, however, bankers have shifted their political support
to democracies. This did not reflect egalitarian or liberal political
convictions as such, but rather a desire for better security for their
loans.
As James Steuart explained in 1767, royal
borrowings remained private affairs rather than truly public debts. For a
sovereigns debts to become binding upon the entire nation, elected
representatives had to enact the taxes to pay their interest charges.
By giving taxpayers this voice in government, the Dutch and British
democracies provided creditors with much safer claims for payment than did
kings and princes whose debts died with them. But the recent debt protests
from Iceland to Greece and Spain suggest that creditors are shifting their
support away from democracies.
They are demanding fiscal austerity and even
privatization sell-offs.
This is turning international finance into a new mode of warfare. Its
objective is the same as military conquest in times past: to appropriate
land and mineral resources, also communal infrastructure and extract
tribute. In response, democracies are demanding referendums over whether to
pay creditors by selling off the public domain and raising taxes to impose
unemployment, falling wages and economic depression.
The alternative is to write down debts or even
annul them, and to re-assert regulatory control over the financial sector.
Near Eastern rulers
...proclaimed clean slates for debtors to preserve
economic balance
Charging interest on advances of goods or money was not originally intended
to polarize economies.
First administered early in the third millennium
BC as a contractual arrangement by Sumers temples and palaces with
merchants and entrepreneurs who typically worked in the royal bureaucracy,
interest at 20 per cent (doubling the principal in five years) was supposed
to approximate a fair share of the returns from long-distance trade or
leasing land and other public assets such as workshops, boats and ale
houses.
As the practice was privatized by royal collectors of user fees and rents,
divine kingship protected agrarian debtors.
Hammurabis laws (c. 1750 BC) cancelled
their debts in times of flood or drought. All the rulers of his Babylonian
dynasty began their first full year on the throne by cancelling agrarian
debts so as to clear out payment arrears by proclaiming a clean slate.
Bondservants, land or crop rights and other pledges were returned to the
debtors to restore order in an idealized original condition of balance.
This practice survived in the Jubilee Year of
Mosaic Law in Leviticus 25.
The logic was clear enough. Ancient societies needed to field armies to
defend their land, and this required liberating indebted citizens from
bondage. Hammurabis laws protected charioteers and other fighters from
being reduced to debt bondage, and blocked creditors from taking the crops
of tenants on royal and other public lands and on communal land that owed
manpower and military service to the palace.
In Egypt, the
pharaoh Bakenranef (c. 720-715 BC,
Bocchoris in Greek) proclaimed a debt amnesty and abolished debt-servitude
when faced with a military threat from Ethiopia.
According to Diodorus of Sicily (I, 79,
writing in 40-30 BC), he ruled that if a debtor contested the claim, the
debt was nullified if the creditor could not back up his claim by producing
a written contract. (It seems that creditors always have been prone to
exaggerate the balances due.)
The pharaoh reasoned that,
the bodies of citizens should belong to the
state, to the end that it might avail itself of the services which its
citizens owed it, in times of both war and peace. For he felt that it
would be absurd for a soldier
to be haled to prison by his creditor for
an unpaid loan, and that the greed of private citizens should in this
way endanger the safety of all.
The fact that the main Near Eastern creditors
were the palace, temples and their collectors made it politically easy to
cancel the debts.
It always is easy to annul debts owed to
oneself. Even Roman emperors burned the tax records to prevent a crisis. But
it was much harder to cancel debts owed to private creditors as the practice
of charging interest spread westward to Mediterranean chiefdoms after about
750 BC. Instead of enabling families to bridge gaps between income and
outgo, debt became the major lever of land expropriation, polarizing
communities between creditor oligarchies and indebted clients.
In Judah, the prophet Isaiah (5:8-9) decried
foreclosing creditors who,
add house to house and join field to field
till no space is left and you live alone in the land.
Creditor power and stable growth rarely have
gone together.
Most personal debts in this classical period
were the product of small amounts of money lent to individuals living on the
edge of subsistence and who could not make ends meet. Forfeiture of land and
assets - and personal liberty - forced debtors into bondage that became
irreversible.
By the 7th century BC, tyrants
(popular leaders) emerged to overthrow the aristocracies in Corinth and
other wealthy Greek cities, gaining support by cancelling the debts. In a
less tyrannical manner, Solon founded the Athenian democracy in 594 BC by
banning debt bondage.
But oligarchies re-emerged and called in Rome when Spartas kings Agis,
Cleomenes and their successor Nabis sought to cancel debts late in the third
century BC. They were killed and their supporters driven out.
It has been a political constant of history
since antiquity that creditor interests opposed both popular democracy and
royal power able to limit the financial conquest of society - a conquest
aimed at attaching interest-bearing debt claims for payment on as much of
the economic surplus as possible.
When the Gracchi brothers and their followers tried to reform the credit
laws in 133 BC, the dominant Senatorial class acted with violence, killing
them and inaugurating a century of Social War, resolved by the ascension of
Augustus as emperor in 29 BC.
Romes creditor
oligarchy
...wins the Social War, enslaves the population and
brings on a Dark Age
Matters were more bloody abroad.
Aristotle did not mention empire building
as part of his political schema, but foreign conquest always has been a
major factor in imposing debts, and war debts have been the major cause of
public debt in modern times. Antiquitys harshest debt levy was by Rome,
whose creditors spread out to plague Asia Minor, its most prosperous
province.
The rule of law all but disappeared when
publican creditor knights arrived.
Mithridates of Pontus led three popular
revolts, and local populations in Ephesus and other cities rose up and
killed a reported 80,000 Romans in 88 BC. The Roman army retaliated, and
Sulla imposed war tribute of 20,000 talents in 84 BC.
Charges for back interest multiplied this sum
six-fold by 70 BC.
Among Romes leading historians, Livy, Plutarch and
Diodorus blamed the fall of the Republic on creditor intransigence in
waging the century-long Social War marked by political murder from 133 to 29
BC. Populist leaders sought to gain a following by advocating debt
cancellations (e.g., the Catiline conspiracy in 63-62 BC). They were killed.
By the second century AD about a quarter of the
population was reduced to bondage.
By the fifth century Romes economy collapsed,
stripped of money. Subsistence life reverted to the countryside.
Creditors find a
legalistic reason to support parliamentary democracy
When banking recovered after the Crusades looted Byzantium and infused
silver and gold to review Western European commerce, Christian opposition to
charging interest was overcome by the combination of prestigious lenders
(the Knights Templars and Hospitallers providing credit during the Crusades)
and their major clients - kings, at first to pay the Church and increasingly
to wage war.
But royal debts went bad when kings died. The
Bardi and Peruzzi went bankrupt in 1345 when Edward III repudiated his war
debts. Banking families lost more on loans to the Habsburg and Bourbon
despots on the thrones of Spain, Austria and France.
Matters changed with the Dutch democracy, seeking to win and secure its
liberty from Habsburg Spain.
The fact that their parliament was to contract
permanent public debts on behalf of the state enabled the Low Countries to
raise loans to employ mercenaries in an epoch when money and credit were the
sinews of war.
Access to credit,
was accordingly their most powerful weapon
in the struggle for their freedom, Richard Ehrenberg wrote in his
Capital and Finance in the Age of the Renaissance (1928):
Anyone who gave credit to a prince knew
that the repayment of the debt depended only on his debtors capacity
and will to pay. The case was very different for the cities, which had
power as overlords, but were also corporations, associations of
individuals held in common bond. According to the generally accepted law
each individual burgher was liable for the debts of the city both with
his person and his property.
The financial achievement of parliamentary
government was thus to establish debts that were not merely the personal
obligations of princes, but were truly public and binding regardless of who
occupied the throne.
This is why the first two democratic nations,
the Netherlands and Britain after its 1688 revolution, developed the most
active capital markets and proceeded to become leading military powers.
What is ironic is that it was the need for war
financing that promoted democracy, forming a symbiotic trinity between
-
war making
-
credit
-
parliamentary democracy,
...which has lasted to this day.
At this time,
the legal position of the King qua borrower
was obscure, and it was still doubtful whether his creditors had any
remedy against him in case of default.
(Charles Wilson, Englands
Apprenticeship: 1603-1763: 1965.)
The more despotic Spain, Austria and France
became, the greater the difficulty they found in financing their military
adventures.
By the end of the eighteenth century Austria was
left,
without credit, and consequently without
much debt,
...the least credit-worthy and worst armed
country in Europe, fully dependent on British subsidies and loan guarantees
by the time of the Napoleonic Wars.
Finance accommodates
itself to democracy
...but then pushes for oligarchy
While the nineteenth centurys democratic reforms reduced the power of
landed aristocracies to control parliaments, bankers moved flexibly to
achieve a symbiotic relationship with nearly every form of government.
In France, followers of
Saint-Simon promoted the idea of banks
acting like mutual funds, extending credit against equity shares in profit.
The German state made an alliance with large banking and heavy industry.
Marx wrote optimistically about how socialism would make finance productive
rather than parasitic. In the United States, regulation of public utilities
went hand in hand with guaranteed returns.
In China, Sun-Yat-Sen wrote in 1922:
I intend to make all the national
industries of China into a Great Trust owned by the Chinese people, and
financed with international capital for mutual benefit.
World War I saw the United States replace
Britain as the major creditor nation, and by the end of World War II it had
cornered some 80 per cent of the worlds monetary gold.
Its diplomats shaped
the IMF and
World Bank along creditor-oriented lines
that financed trade dependency, mainly on the United States. Loans to
finance trade and payments deficits were subject to conditionalities that
shifted economic planning to client oligarchies and military dictatorships.
The democratic response to resulting austerity plans squeezing out debt
service was unable to go much beyond IMF riots, until Argentina rejected
its foreign debt.
A similar creditor-oriented austerity is now being imposed on Europe by the
European Central Bank (ECB) and EU bureaucracy.
Ostensibly social democratic governments have
been directed to save the banks rather than reviving economic growth and
employment. Losses on bad bank loans and speculations are taken onto the
public balance sheet while scaling back public spending and even selling off
infrastructure.
The response of taxpayers stuck with the
resulting debt has been to mount
popular protests starting in Iceland and
Latvia in January 2009, and more widespread demonstrations in Greece and
Spain this autumn to protest their governments refusal to hold referendums
on these fateful bailouts of foreign bondholders.
Shifting planning away
from elected public representatives to bankers
Every economy is planned.
This traditionally has been the function of
government. Relinquishing this role under the slogan of free markets
leaves it in the hands of banks. Yet the planning privilege of credit
creation and allocation turns out to be even more centralized than that of
elected public officials. And to make matters worse, the financial time
frame is short-term hit-and-run, ending up as asset stripping.
By seeking their own gains, the banks tend to
destroy the economy.
The surplus ends up being consumed by interest
and other financial charges, leaving no revenue for new capital investment
or basic social spending.
This is why relinquishing policy control to a creditor class rarely has gone
together with economic growth and rising living standards. The tendency for
debts to grow faster than the populations ability to pay has been a basic
constant throughout all recorded history. Debts mount up exponentially,
absorbing the surplus and reducing much of the population to the equivalent
of debt peonage.
To restore economic balance, antiquitys cry for
debt cancellation sought what the Bronze Age Near East achieved by royal
fiat:
to cancel the overgrowth of debts.
In more modern times, democracies have urged a
strong state to tax rentier income and wealth, and when called for, to write
down debts. This is done most readily when the state itself creates money
and credit.
It is done least easily when banks translate
their gains into political power.
When banks are permitted to be self-regulating
and given veto power over government regulators, the economy is distorted to
permit creditors to indulge in the speculative gambles and outright fraud
that have marked the past decade.
The fall of the Roman Empire demonstrates what
happens when creditor demands are unchecked. Under these conditions the
alternative to government planning and regulation of the financial sector
becomes a road to debt peonage.
Finance vs. government
- oligarchy vs. democracy
Democracy involves subordinating financial dynamics to serve economic
balance and growth - and taxing rentier income or keeping basic monopolies
in the public domain. Untaxing or privatizing property income frees it to
be pledged to the banks, to be capitalized into larger loans.
Financed by debt leveraging, asset-price
inflation increases rentier wealth while indebting the economy at large. The
economy shrinks, falling into negative equity.
The financial sector has gained sufficient influence to use such emergencies
as an opportunity to convince governments that that the economy will
collapse they it do not save the banks.
In practice this means consolidating their
control over policy, which they use in ways that further polarize economies.
The basic model is what occurred in ancient Rome, moving from democracy to
oligarchy. In fact, giving priority to bankers and leaving economic planning
to be dictated by the EU, ECB and IMF threatens to strip the nation-state of
the power to coin or print money and levy taxes.
The resulting conflict is pitting financial interests against national
self-determination. The idea of an independent central bank being the
hallmark of democracy is a euphemism for relinquishing the most important
policy decision - the ability to create money and credit - to the financial
sector. Rather than leaving the policy choice to popular referendums, the
rescue of banks organized by the EU and ECB now represents the largest
category of rising national debt.
The private bank debts taken onto government
balance sheets in Ireland and Greece have been turned into taxpayer
obligations.
The same is true for Americas $13 trillion
added since September 2008 (including $5.3 trillion in Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac bad mortgages taken onto the governments balance sheet, and $2
trillion of
Federal Reserve cash-for-trash swaps).
This is being dictated by financial proxies euphemized as technocrats.
Designated by creditor lobbyists, their role is to calculate just how much
unemployment and depression is needed to squeeze out a surplus to pay
creditors for debts now on the books. What makes this calculation
self-defeating is the fact that economic shrinkage - debt deflation - makes
the debt burden even more unpayable.
Neither banks nor public authorities (or mainstream academics, for that
matter) calculated the economys realistic ability to pay - that is, to pay
without shrinking the economy.
Through their media and think tanks, they have
convinced populations that the way to get rich most rapidly is to borrow
money to buy real estate, stocks and bonds rising in price - being inflated
by bank credit - and to reverse the past centurys progressive taxation of
wealth.
To put matters bluntly, the result has been junk economics. Its aim is to
disable public checks and balances, shifting planning power into the hands
of high finance on the claim that this is more efficient than public
regulation.
Government planning and taxation is accused of
being the road to serfdom, as if free markets controlled by bankers
given leeway to act recklessly is not planned by special interests in ways
that are oligarchic, not democratic. Governments are told to pay bailout
debts taken on not to defend countries in military warfare as in times past,
but to benefit the wealthiest layer of the population by shifting its losses
onto taxpayers.
The failure to take the wishes of voters into consideration leaves the
resulting national debts on shaky ground politically and even legally.
Debts imposed by fiat, by governments or foreign
financial agencies in the face of strong popular opposition may be as
tenuous as those of the Habsburgs and other despots in past epochs. Lacking
popular validation, they may die with the regime that contracted them.
New governments may act democratically to
subordinate the banking and financial sector to serve the economy, not the
other way around.
At the very least, they may seek to pay by re-introducing progressive
taxation of wealth and income, shifting the fiscal burden onto rentier
wealth and property. Re-regulation of banking and providing a public option
for credit and banking services would renew the social democratic program
that seemed well underway a century ago.
Iceland and Argentina are most
recent examples, but one may look back to the moratorium on Inter-Ally arms
debts and German reparations in 1931.
A basic mathematical as well as political
principle is at work:
Debts that cant be paid, wont be.
