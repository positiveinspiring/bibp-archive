After being pressed today by Republican Senator Ron Johnson to explain how
it was that over the course of weeks, the
Obama Administration stood by an
absurd story claiming that four Americans were murdered in Libya due to a
spontaneous protest gone bad, outgoing Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton
played the indignation card.
Because she obviously had no answer to justify the ongoing White House
deception, Secretary Clinton chose theatrics over a straight answer and
clarity:
Banksters
Assistant Attorney General Admits on TV That...
In The U.S. Justice Does Not
Apply to The Banks

Those who watched Frontline's special on why nobody has been prosecuted on
Wall Street titled appropriately "The Untouchables" didn't learn much new.
The rehash of ideas presented is what has been
well known for years - namely that when it comes to prosecuting Wall Street
criminals nothing will
ever happen, because as
Bill Gross
tweeted,
"Its not
Republican in politics. Its not Dem in politics. Its money in politics",
...and
all the money in politics comes from Wall Street, which happens to be the
ultimate ruler of the United States of America, pushing levers here and
pulling stringer there to give the impression the constitutional republic is
still alive.
It isn't - this country has become an unchecked
despotism of those in charge of money creation and who control capital -
just the thing Andrew Jackson warned against.
One thing we did learn, was courtesy of
Assistant Attorney General Lenny Breuer who made it very clear that when it
comes to the concept of justice the banks are and always have been "more
equal" than others.
He does so in such shocking clarity and
enthusiasm that it is a miracle that this person is still employed by the US
Department of Justice.
To wit from the
transcript:
MARTIN SMITH:
You gave a speech before the New York Bar Association. And in that
speech, you made a reference to losing sleep at night, worrying about
what a lawsuit might result in at a large financial institution.
LANNY BREUER:
Right.
MARTIN SMITH:
Is that really the job of a prosecutor, to worry about anything other
than simply pursuing justice?
LANNY BREUER:
Well, I think I am pursuing justice. And I think the entire
responsibility of the department is to pursue justice.
But in any given case, I think I and
prosecutors around the country, being responsible, should speak to
regulators, should speak to experts, because if I bring a case against
institution A, and as a result of bringing that case, theres some huge
economic effect - if it creates a ripple effect so that suddenly,
counterparties and other financial institutions or other companies that
had nothing to do with this are affected badly - its a factor we need
to know and understand.
In other words, no criminal charges can be
levied against anyone who engaged in the crimes leading to the great
financial crisis of 2008 because, get this,
the implications of pursuing justice may
have destabilizing implications!
In other words, the banker threat of
Mutual Assured Destruction has metastasized from the legislative, where in
2008 Hank Paulson demanded a blank check from Congress to spend it on
whatever he wishes, "or
else...", and has fully taken over the Judicial, where there
is Justice for all...
and no "Justice" for those who are systemically important.
Ted Kaufman summarizes:
TED KAUFMAN: That was very disturbing
to me, very disturbing. That was never raised at any time during any of
our discussions.
That is not the job of a prosecutor, to worry about the health of the
banks, in my opinion. Job of the prosecutors is to prosecute criminal
behavior. Its not to lie awake at night and kind of decide the future
of the banks.
Alas Ted, it appears it is.
Frontline's conclusion was perfectly expected:
"to date,
not one senior Wall Street executive has been held criminally liable by
the Department of Justice for activities related to the financial crisis."
We now know why: it is because of
people like this:
Lanny A. Breuer was unanimously confirmed as
