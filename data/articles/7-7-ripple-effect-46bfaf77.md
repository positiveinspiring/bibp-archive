2005.
El productor y realizador del documental, el
cual se hace llamar "Muad'Dib",
ha hecho un maravilloso trabajo de investigación, presentación, unificación
y de elaboración de una lista comprensiva de hechos verificables y
documentados, los cuales ofrecen pruebas concluyentes de que la versión
oficial de los acontecimientos del 7 de julio fueron una burda e
intencionada mentira.

"MOCK EXERCISES AND BOMB HOAXES IN
THE RUN-UP TO 7/7/2005"
More than a year before the 7/7/2005
attacks, on the 16th of May 2004, an edition of the BBC ONE Panorama
program broadcasted a mock exercise, imagining what would happen if a
terrorist-attack was executed in London, in the NEAR FUTURE, consisting of
three explosions on tube-trains in the London Underground, and one explosion
on a road vehicle.
The following excerpt from the
BBC transcript of the program, gives us a
good idea of why this program was made
"PRICE: If there are now bombs going off above ground, in this case a lorry
being attacked, it could happen anywhere, so the potential for mass panic
across not just the capital, but the whole country, is very much with us. I
think therefore we need to look at more serious measures. We do have reserve
powers in effect to take over the BBC if we were to wish to, and to get them
to broadcast whatever we wanted them to broadcast. Those powers are there in
the Broadcasting Act. My advice to the Prime Minister would be not to use
those, but I think we should be talking to the broadcasters about having the
Prime Minister on the air very quickly.
GILBERTSON: You wouldn't disagree with that Michael at all?
PORTILLO: No, I entirely agree that the Prime Minister should be out
there, and we shouldn't be using the powers to bring in the BBC, but we
should certainly be talking to the broadcasters, about the way in which
the coverage is going to be organized."
(end quote)
Please note well that he said,
"the coverage is going to be ORGANIZED."
In
other words, he was saying that they would write the script for, then edit
and control, the media coverage of an event in which there were three
explosions on London tube-trains, and one on a road vehicle, if such an
event were to take place in the near future.
The question that begs to be
asked is this: was that what they were actually in the process of planning,
and precisely the reason for that program?
Gavin Esler: This is the kind of terrorist attack the government repeatedly
says is going to happen.
March 2004 David Blunkett, Home Secretary: "We've been absolutely clear we
can't guarantee that there will never be an attack. It's quite likely that
they're planning one now."
Michael Portillo says, "I am
wondering about the purpose and effect of this very program."
This BBC Panorama program appears to have been used by those behind the
7/7/2005 attack, as the means by which the media's response to the attack in
the near future was studied, so it could be controlled and directed towards
their own ends.
Mr. Price plays the "bad cop" and issues the threat of
taking over control of the BBC, and then Mr. Portillo plays the "good cop"
and says that there is no need to do that, as long as the BBC behaves
itself, and broadcasts whatever they want them to. The "good cop", "bad cop"
scenario is just theatre, to deceive the viewer.
The reality is that the BBC
is a government propaganda machine and is already, and always has been,
controlled and used by the government.

TUBE EXPLOSIONS
3 blasts on London Underground
The headlines at 9 o'clock.
In the past hour there have been three major explosions on the London
underground. The first occurred at 10 past 8 on the Piccadilly line between
Knightsbridge and Hyde Park Corner. The second, at 16 minutes past 8, on the
Central Line between Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus, and the third
at 27 minutes past 8 as a train was arriving at Vauxhall Station from
Stockwell on the Victoria line. Emergency services have been called to all
three scenes. There are no reports available yet on the number of
casualties, and the police have said that it's too early to identify a
possible cause. London underground is now closed and the police are asking
people not to travel.
Peter Power clip from Panorama from 6:45 to 7:00 minutes:
Our research indicates that something like 350,000 people alone are making
their way towards the city of London at this point, and if the access
overload system has been triggered and they can't get onto their mobile
telephones, this will have profound indications for them, the next of kin...

LONDON ATTACKS
Chlorine tanker explodes
We can now confirm that a tanker carrying chlorine has exploded at the
junction of Shoreditch High Street and Commercial Street. Chlorine is
extremely toxic in this form and the police are issuing express warnings to
people to stay indoors, close windows and remain there until the all clear
is given.
(end quote)
In the days leading up to 7/7/2005 there were hoax bomb-scares in Nottingham
and Sheffield.
Were these false-alarm hoaxes meant not only to cause panic and confusion,
but also to lull everyone into a false sense of security, and into thinking
that the initial reports in London on 7/7/2005 would also be false-alarm
hoaxes, so people would ignore them; until it was too late?
Town bomb scare 'genuine mistake'
Bomb scare leads to city gridlock
"PETER POWER: DUPE, OR ACCOMPLICE?"
Then, on 7/7/2005, we were told on TV, by
Peter Power of Visor Consultants, that they, and the private company
employing them, who helped choose the scenario for it, were running a mock
terrorist drill, in the London Underground, with practically the same
scenario as what actually really happened on that day.
In other words, the
actual mock anti-terror drill that the BBC Panorama program of May 2004
had outlined, had been chosen, by Visor's client, to be carried out on the
VERY same day that four Muslim suicide-bombers, ALSO chose the same
scenarios that Visor's client had chosen for the mock drill, causing real
and devastating explosions on three London tube-trains and one road vehicle.
Please think about that unbelievable set of coincidences for a few seconds,
to let the implications of it sink in.
Then, please ask yourself: what are
the odds against all of that happening by chance?
In his TV video clip Peter Power states that their customer helped to choose
the exact scenario. I repeat: Visor's customer helped to choose the exact
scenario. To this day Peter Power refuses to publicly identify the customer
who chose the exact scenario.
Why?
"FOREIGN SECURITY FIRMS - CAN THEY
BE TRUSTED?"
Verint Systems is the security firm that is responsible for the CCTV
surveillance cameras, in the London Underground rail network, and it is an
Israeli company, with approximately 1000 employees.
No CCTV footage of the
four Muslims boarding the tube-trains has been released by Verint; who claim
that their cameras were not working.
Why?
Because the four Muslims were not
on the tube-trains that blew up.
"THE FOUR MUSLIMS - ACTORS, OR PATSIES?"
We were also told that the training
exercise involved 1000 people, and, of course, amongst those 1000 people,
would have to be the four people, who were recruited to play the parts of
the mock terrorists.
Therefore, as part of the exercise, they would have recruited four young
Muslim men to carry four backpacks, that were to contain mock explosive
devices.
Who were their Muslim recruits?
These Muslim men would naturally buy return train tickets, and not one-way
tickets, because they would be going home after playing their parts in the
training exercise.
Why did they buy return train tickets to Luton?
One of them, the oldest; who would be considered the ring-leader of the
group, because of his age; would have been asked to make a "suicide video"
prior to 7/7/2005, being told it would form part of the training
mock-terrorist exercise; in order to make the exercise, and possibly a film
to be made of it, look as realistic as possible. He would obviously not have
been told the details of the whole plan, until later, probably when he and
the others arrived in Luton on the 7th of July 2005, to make absolutely
certain that the scenario of the drill which would take place that day,
could not be talked about by, or to, anyone.
The second oldest would also be asked to make a similar video, as a back-up,
for just in case anything went wrong, and/or the oldest pulled out of the
drill before the 7th of July 2005.
It should be noted that neither Mohammed Sidique Khan, nor Shehzad Tanweer,
specify what their targets were, in their videos.
It is also interesting to
note that no-one has ever claimed responsibility for the 7/7/2005 bombings,
except for a message on a fake Al Quaeda website on the same day, that was
traced to Texas in the USA.
UK-based dissident denies link to website that carried al-Qaida claim
Two years afterwards, because more and more people doubt the official story
and are proving it to be lies and deception, and are rightfully demanding an
independent investigation, the police have arrested, frightened, intimidated
and harassed Mohammed Sidique Khan's widow into publicly condemning her
husband. She has a young daughter to protect, and has stated that she is now
afraid of the police.
They kept her in custody for 6 days, to intimidate her
and then showed her what they claim is her husband's Will and
"suicide-note."
Obviously this was done to get her to condemn her husband
publicly, in exchange for the authorities' implied agreement to leave her
alone, to which she will have agreed, in order to protect herself and her
young daughter from further harassment. Where were these documents found,
and why did it take two years for them to be shown to her? They are,
after-all, her rightful property, if genuine.
Two years is ample time to
forge a short handwritten note, and signature on a Will.
|
J7 | The July Seventh Truth Campaign
In view of the amount of time this
"suicide-note" has taken to be mentioned,
the timing of it, and all the lies and evidence the authorities have told,
fabricated and planted, it cannot be trusted and must be considered another
forgery, along with any other new so-called evidence that they might come up
with.
So, the scene is set for the training exercise to go ahead.
The fake terrorists have been recruited, the suicide videos have been made,
and everyone has been given basic instructions, for the day that the
exercise is to be put into operation 7/7/2005.
The four mock-terrorist actors were to meet at Luton Train Station at 07:20
AM on the 7th of July 2005 and catch the 07:40 AM train from Luton to Kings'
Cross Thameslink Station, with their pretend-bomb backpacks, and then split
up and catch three tube-trains and one bus, to pre-arranged destinations,
where the fake explosions were to take place, as part of the training
exercise.
Finally the big day arrived.
Everyone was ready. Everyone was either already where he was meant to be, or
was heading there.
But first let us take a step backwards for a moment, to look at the bigger
picture, and put this mock-terror exercise into context with what was
happening in Britain at that time.
Tony Blair was in big trouble, because he had just been sent a very clear
message from the British nation; via the May 2005 General Election, in which
he was almost voted out of power; that the British people did not want
British troops fighting in George Bush's War of Terror in the Middle-East.
So, to be able to keep the British troops fighting in the Middle-East, Tony
Blair desperately needed something to happen, to change the nation's mind.
Gleneagles = Tony Blair; George Bush; G8 Meeting; Agenda of addressing World
Poverty forced on them by Live Eight concerts around the world, but not for
long. Their lucrative, evil, phoney and very unpopular War on Terror (which
is really a War OF Terror) will promptly return to the top of the agenda,
with four big bangs. No time for the poor, the rich have lots more money to
make, and people to murder.
Leeds = Where 3 of the Muslim actors lived and were recruited, and where the
oldest, Mohammed Sidique Khan, was befriended by the local police, and was
regularly called upon by them, to help them to sort out gang-rivalry
problems. Mohammed was also taken on a tour of the House of Commons by a
Leeds MP, who befriended him. The perfect patsy? Someone who was made to
believe he could trust the authorities, and that they would therefore not
deceive, or harm him? Someone who could, in turn, recruit 2 other Muslims
for the drill, so they could all become famous and make a nice bit of clean
and easy extra money, and show their patriotism by helping the authorities
to protect Britain from terrorism?
7 July 2005 London bombings - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Aylesbury = A fourth Muslim actor who has been recruited, Germaine Lindsey
from Aylesbury, will also meet them in Luton.
Luton = Transport security firm ICTS, another Israeli company, has an office
just a mile away from the Luton train station, which is suspected to be
where the Muslim actors received their final instructions, before setting
off for the train station - the details of which trains to board, which
carriages to get into, where to sit, and which bus to catch, where to sit on
it, and at what time.
London = Commissioner of Police Ian Blair; Rudy Giuliani (Mayor of New York
on 9/11); Benjamin Netanyahu (who said 9-11 was good for Israel); Peter
Power; and all those taking part in the mock-terrorism drill, are present in
Central London, in or around London Underground locations where the
explosions take place, and also Tavistock Square.
Fake CCTV image
The four men were supposed to arrive together, on time, at
Luton Station, and be caught on CCTV, at 07:21:54 AM, entering the station,
but three of them are not on the same video frames as Hasib Hussain, so have
to be inserted later, using computer software.
Hence the obviously, and very
badly, doctored official single frame, time-stamped photo that we have been
shown, from the CCTV outside Luton Station.
They can't show them moving, because it has been faked, that's why they show
only one single frame still photo.
Why did the authorities have to fake this photo?
They would have had to fake
it, because three of the actors missed the tube-trains that they were
supposed to catch, and which blew up without them being onboard, and so
there was no video footage from Verint Systems of them boarding the three
tube-trains, for the authorities to be able to use, as false evidence, to
try to prove to the public that the Muslims were guilty. So they had to
doctor and show us the fake photo instead.
Remember what Michael Portillo said on the May 2004 BBC Panorama program:
"the coverage is going to be ORGANIZED."
So far, they are apparently running according to the training exercise plan,
and on schedule.
"THE GHOST TRAINS"
Unfortunately for the people who have
organized the event, the train that the four Muslim actors are supposed to
catch, the 07:40 AM train to Kings' Cross Thameslink, has been cancelled and
the next one too, so they cannot possibly make it in time to catch the
tube-trains, that they were supposed to catch, as part of the training
exercise.
The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, as the Hand of God
interferes.
In spite of official confirmation that the 07:40 AM train was cancelled, and
the next one too, the Home Office report still contains the lie that the
non-existent 07:40 AM train was the one that the four Muslims caught.
The
authorities have to keep lying about it, in order to continue to try to make
the public believe, that three of the four Muslim men, who boarded a train
from Luton to King's Cross, arrived in time to catch the three tube-trains
that blew up. In so doing, the authorities make it perfectly clear, that the
truth of what happened that day is of no importance to them.
It is obvious
from their actions that the only thing that is important to the authorities,
is to make us believe what they had already planned to make us believe, even
when the facts prove it to be a lie.
Facts About the Train Times on July 7th
The first available train the Muslim actors can catch, gets them to King's
Cross after the tube trains have already left without them.
Hasib Hussain
splits off from the other three at King's Cross Thameslink station, because
he still has time to catch the number 30 bus, as his part in the mock-terror
exercise. When the tube-trains they were supposed to catch are blown up, the
other three smell a rat and realize they have been duped, and are Muslim
patsies who will be blamed for the attacks, and everyone knows what happened
to Lee Harvey Oswald.
The Muslims are not from London. Their homes are many miles away, and so
they are like fish out of water, and have no idea what to do, or where to go
and hide. They realize that they can't go home, and do not know anyone in
London whom they can trust.
The phones are all not working, first of all because they were jammed, and
then shut down by the authorities, so they cannot phone anyone to tell them
what has happened. What can they do to prevent themselves from being wrongly
blamed for the explosions? What would you do in that situation?
On one of the early TV news broadcasts that day, a newsreader announced that
a report has come in, that three of the terrorists involved in the bombings
have been shot and killed, by the anti-terrorist branch of the police, at
Canary Wharf, in the Docklands area of London's East-end. The announcement
was made only once, and never repeated, for obvious reasons.
How could
suicide-bombers possibly have survived the tube-train bombings, and then
been in the Docklands to be shot?
In a New Zealand Herald newspaper article
it says that two people were shot dead outside the HSBC building, and in
Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper only one.
'Police shot bombers' reports New Zealander
There is another newspaper report, that the police shot a suicide bomber
outside the Credit Suisse First Boston Bank, which is approximately 1,400
feet, or 467 yards, away from the HSBC building, measured door to door. The
two buildings are very different in both shape and size, and 467 yards
apart, and thus they are not easily confused with each other.
POLICE were yesterday probing reports a man had been "neutralized"
outside Canary Wharf. It is believed the man was shot dead by police
marksmen outside the Credit Suisse First Boston bank.
South London Press
That means that the police shot and killed at least three suicide-bombers in
Canary Wharf, on 7/7/2005. How could suicide-bombers, who were supposed to
have blown themselves up on the three tube-trains, have survived and been
shot-dead at Canary Wharf?
If we have at least three of the four "suicide-bombers" shot dead at Canary
Wharf, and we KNOW they weren't on the tube-trains that blew up, because the
07:40 AM train from Luton to King's Cross was cancelled that day, then we
have overwhelming proof that they did not blow the tube-trains up, and that
the blowing up of the three tube-trains was an inside-job.
At the Canary Wharf Docklands site there are media companies, for the Muslim
patsies to have told their story to and cleared their names, if they could,
and two possible escape routes, via air from the nearby London City Airport,
that has flights to 34 destinations in the U.K. and Europe, and, if they
couldn't fly out, there was the possibility of getting a boat across the
channel to France.
"THE NUMBER 30 BUS"
The fourth Muslim backpacker, Hasib
Hussain, who has been blamed for the number 30 bus-bombing, is reported to
have been seen wandering around London, going into McDonalds, and eating a
beef-burger.
He is reported to have tried unsuccessfully to contact the
other three by phone, on Euston Road outside King's Cross at 08.55 AM, but
the phones were not working, because they were first of all jammed, and then
shut down by the authorities.
What happened to him?
He was the youngest of the four, only eighteen years old, and described, by
those who knew him, as a gentle giant. Therefore he was possibly the least
worldly-wise, and he was also on his own, in a strange city, and a long way
from home.
He might not have realized he was in danger of being framed as a
patsy, believed all the chaos around that part of London was just part of
the mock-terrorism exercise that he was part of, and so just continued with
his assigned role, which was to board a certain double-decker bus, at an
appointed time, and sit at the back of the top deck.
A double-decker, upon
which a large advertisement for a play had been placed on one side, reading:
"Outright Terror, Bold
And Brilliant."
Think about that sign on the side of the bus, and the sick minds of
the people who planned the attacks.
Now this is where it gets weird, because we are told that Hasib Hussain
started from King's Cross Thameslink station, and was seen on a number 91
bus traveling West along Euston Road to Euston Station, where he caught the
number 30 bus, that would have then traveled East, back along Euston Road
retracing his steps, back to where he started from at King's Cross, if it
had not been diverted into Tavistock Square.
Why would someone carrying a
large, heavy backpack do that, unless he was following a script, written by
someone who knew, in advance, that that particular number 30 bus,
registration LX03BUF, would be diverted into Tavistock Square, and that
Hasib Hussain would therefore not be able to get on it at King's Cross
Thameslink, which is where he had arrived at, on the train from Luton?
Only
someone who is a stranger to London would do that without asking why,
because it is a totally illogical thing to do, for someone who knows London,
and knows that the number 30 bus goes past King's Cross Thameslink station,
so that they could have caught it there, instead.
It would be a complete
waste, of time, energy, money, and an unnecessary risk to take, and thus a
totally illogical thing for a real terrorist to do.
London Buses route 30
It now gets unbelievably weird, because the number 91 bus, that Hasib
Hussain is reported to have taken from King's Cross, along Euston Road to
Euston Station; to board the number 30 bus, registration LX03BUF, that got
diverted into Tavistock Square; actually goes to Tavistock Square.
So, if he
wanted to get to Tavistock Square, he could just have stayed on the number
91 bus, and been sure of getting directly to Tavistock Square. The number 91
bus route goes from King's Cross to Tavistock Square.
London Buses route 91
That is conclusive proof that that particular number 30 bus, registration
LX03BUF, was part of Peter Power and his customer's mock-terrorist drill,
pre-rigged with explosives, like the three tube-trains, and was pre-planned
to be diverted into, and blown up in, Tavistock Square, rather than blown up
by a backpack bomb.
Whoever planned this, obviously planned to kill Hasib
Hussain with that bus explosion, so he could not tell anyone what had
happened, just as they had planned to kill the other three Muslim actors
with the explosions on the three tube-trains.
At 09.00 AM a number 30 bus, registration LX03BUF, left Marble Arch on its
return journey to Hackney Wick. It arrived at Euston Bus Station at 09.35
AM, but was then diverted from its normal route, into Tavistock Square, and
stopped outside the medical offices of the BMA, where it was blown up, at
09.47 AM, as part of the terrorist exercise gone live.
This also fits with
the BBC Panorama mock-terrorist program of May 2004, where the explosion
of a road vehicle was scheduled to take place AFTER the three tube-train
explosions.
A white van from a
demolition company called Kingstar is seen and
photographed parked at the side of the bus, immediately after the explosion,
and a mysterious "witness", Richard Jones, gives an account of what he says
happened to the bus, on camera; which is something that normally would not
be allowed by the police, unless it was part of a filmed training-exercise.
Then, after a spate of very contradictory TV and newspaper interviews,
within a very short space of time; that make sure everyone now believes the
explosion was caused by a suicide-bomber on the bus; Richard Jones
disappears from view.
However, and of particular interest, some newspapers, including the U.K.'s
Sunday Mail on the 10th July 2005, reported that
Richard Jones served an
apprenticeship at an explosives factory, in Ayrshire.
Richard Jones'
statements, about the suicide-bomber, are very suspicious, for two reasons:
-
first, because they are so inconsistent and contradictory that they are not
believable
-
second, because criminals usually accuse someone else, to
divert attention away from themselves
Is that what Richard Jones did?
He
says that he and eleven other people got off the bus, just before it
exploded. Were the twelve of them a team, with the other eleven there to
cover up what Richard Jones was doing, as he planted a bomb?
Another strange
statement he made, to The Sun Newspaper, reported in the 8th July 2005
edition, is that he got off the bus, because he had reached his destination.
-
How could he possibly have reached his destination, on a bus that had been
diverted from its normal route, unless he was part of the mock-terrorism
exercise team, and got off the bus, as planned, in Tavistock Square, after
planting a bomb, just before it was detonated?
-
Does he work for Kingstar?
Kingstar, whose white van was parked next to the bus, is a company that
specializes in controlled demolitions, and Richard Jones said he served an
apprenticeship at an explosives factory in Ayrshire.
Was the Kingstar van
there as part of Peter Power and his customer's training mock-terrorism
drill, to supervise the mock-explosion that became real?
So, if Hasib Hussain was supposed to have been on that number 30 bus,
registration LX03BUF, how would it be possible for him to get the exact bus,
that would get him to one of the four locations where the mock-terrorist
exercise would be taking place, when that bus was diverted from its normal
route, to Tavistock Square, unless he had been recruited to play the part of
a mock-terrorist and told exactly which bus to get, where and at what time,
by the people who organised the mock-terrorism exercise, and who knew the
bus would be diverted to Tavistock Square?
The odds against that happening
by coincidence are unbelievable, and thus it is not possible that it was a
coincidence.
Another unbelievable coincidence is that all of the CCTV cameras, at all
four of the blast sites, were not working that day.
The four CCTV cameras on the number 30 bus were; just like the Israeli
Verint Systems' ones on the underground; not working, and there are no
reliable witnesses who can place Hasib Hussain on the number 30 bus. Richard
Jones is an unreliable witness, whose physical description, of the man he
says was the suicide-bomber, does not fit with Hasib Hussain's appearance,
or what he was wearing that day.
So there is no proof that Hasib Hussain was
either on that bus, or blew it up. Even so, he has been tried and wrongfully
found guilty of blowing up the number 30 bus, by the government organized
and controlled media machine, without a shred of real evidence.
London Stagecoach Employee Says Bus Bombing Suspicious
CCTV cameras on the bus were not working
They claim to have found Hasib Hussain's ID in Tavistock Square. However,
they also claim that ID from another of the four, Mohammed Sidique Khan, was
found in at least two, some reports say three, separate blast locations. He
cannot possibly have been in two or all three locations at the same time,
proving that these items were planted after the blasts.
How could their IDs
have survived suicide bomb-blasts?
Millions of people are aware of the magic
fireproof Mohammed Atta passport, that was planted at the WTC on 9-11. In
light of these incidents, if ID from Hasib Hussain was found at Tavistock
Square, it does not necessarily mean that he was on the bus, and not
somewhere else, or, if he was on the bus, that he blew the bus up.
What has happened to the presumption of innocence; and being considered
innocent until proven guilty and convicted by a jury of your peers, in
court; that has always been the mainstay of British justice?
The most likely case is that the number 30 bus had been pre-rigged with
explosives during its previous service, when the CCTV cameras were disabled.
The CCTV systems on Stagecoach buses are normally either the Israeli company
Verint Systems RP12001, or Timespace X.200.
A witness, Richmal Marie Oates-Whitehead, aged 35, who worked at the BMA in
Tavistock Square, and was hailed as a heroine for her actions during the
London bombings, said she heard two explosions on the bus.
The controlled
media immediately went on the offensive, and did a character assassination
of the heroine, because her testimony did not fit with the official story,
and she died unexpectedly, shortly afterwards. However, other witnesses also
reported a second explosion on the bus. Richmal's and other witness'
testimonies would account for pre-planted explosives, and a bomb being
planted later, on 7/7/2005.
What we can be certain about though, is that, either on the bus, or
elsewhere, Hasib Hussain; like the other three Muslim patsies; was murdered.
"PRE-PLANTED EXPLOSIVES"
Witnesses of the tube-train explosions
state that there were no Muslims with backpacks, and no backpacks, or bags,
left unattended on the trains, in the carriages that blew up, and that the
floors of the trains blew upwards from underneath, not downwards, as would
be the case with explosives inside the trains.
Explosives underneath the train floors; powerful enough to rupture the
carriage floors and bend them upwards; would also lift the carriages up off
the rails and derail them, as did happen.
Those explosives were not
home-made, but military-grade high-explosives, that would not be available
to Muslim suicide-bombers. The official story was that they used home-made
explosives, which has later been proven to be a lie.
So we know, from reliable eye-witnesses, who can be traced, that there were
no backpack home-made bombs or Muslim bombers inside the tube-train
carriages that blew up, and that the floors blew upwards, so the bombs,
which were made from military high-grade explosives, must have been fastened
underneath the floors of the train carriages.
Only people having access to
the tube-trains, during the times that the trains were not running, would be
able to plant those bombs, under the train floors.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Finance Minister, said that he was warned by
Scotland Yard; not to leave his hotel-room, on the morning of 7/7/2005,
before the first explosion was reported; implying that they had
foreknowledge of the plan.
Scotland Yard then quickly denied being the ones
who provided the warning, but have not told us who did warn Netanyahu, if
they did not.

Why was Benjamin Netanyahu warned, but not the British people
who pay their wages, and whom they are paid to protect?
-
Was it because it
would have spoiled their evil plan, to murder British people, to change the
nation's mind, about British troops fighting in the Middle-East?
Two weeks later the head of the Israeli Mossad, General
Meir Dagan, said
that he had warned Benjamin Netanyahu at 08.40 AM, on 7/7/2005, ten minutes
before the first blast occurred.
-
How did he know what was going to happen in
London, if Scotland Yard did not warn him?
-
Did he wait, to warn Benjamin
Netanyahu, until it was too late to warn the British people, so as not to
spoil their evil plan?
-
Was the London bombing a covert MI5 operation, or an
Israeli Mossad operation, or a joint operation by both of them?
The British
people have the right to know.
Tony Blair said on the day of the explosions, that, "We KNOW this was done
in the name of Islam", when there was no proof whatsoever of who had done
it, therefore indicating he possibly had foreknowledge of the plan and who
they intended to blame, and the reason why they were going to blame the
Muslims.
As proof that this was a slip-up, and needed covering up, look at how the
BBC later falsely reported his actual words, giving further proof that the
BBC is a government propaganda machine and the coverage was "organized",
exactly as Michael Portillo said it would be, in the BBC Panorama program
in May 2004.
"In addition I welcome the statement that has been put out by the Muslim
Council of Great Britain. We know that these people act in the name of
Islam..."
Statement from the PM following COBR meeting
"In addition, I welcome the statement put out by the Muslim Council who know
that those people acted in the name of Islam..."
BBC: In full: Blair on bomb blasts
Later that same day, Efraim Halevi, a former head of the Israeli Mossad,
wrote in an article published on the Jerusalem Post website, at 18:10 PM
(London time), that the attacks had been carried out simultaneously with
"near-perfect" execution.
-
How did he know they had only been
"near-perfect"?
-
How could he have known what the "perfect" results should have been, in
order to know that the actual results were not perfect, unless he was in on
the plot?
-
How many more people had they intended to murder, in order for it
to be considered "perfect" execution?
-
How did he know, at least two days
before the London authorities released the information on the 9th of July,
that the bombs were detonated simultaneously, unless he was in on the plot?
As proof that this too was a slip-up, the Jerusalem Post article in question
was completely removed from their website, after people began to ask similar
questions.
Ex-Mossad Chief Calls For World War After London Attack
The following day Police Commissioner Ian Blair also made a slip-up, on
camera, and said that there were four miserable bombers, and then very
quickly corrected himself, showing that he too possibly had foreknowledge of
the plan to use four Muslims as patsies.
We are told that the first reports were of an electrical power-surge that
occurred, and then later we were told that there were bombs that exploded on
the tube-trains, and that it was an Al Quaeda terrorist attack, with Muslim
suicide-bombers carrying backpack home-made explosive-devices onto the
tube-trains.
A couple of weeks later, a Brazilian contract electrician is brutally and
publicly murdered, on a tube-train, and again we are told lies by the police
and media, about him.
He was a contract electrician. For whom had he been working, and what had he
been working on, in the days leading up to the 7th of July 2005? Remember
that the first reports from the media about 7/7/2005 were of an electrical
power-surge, and Jean Charles de Menezes was a contract electrician.
Was he hired, as part of the terrorist exercise's 1000 people, to wire up
devices for mock-explosions, to be set off by a power-surge? Did he see the
explosive-devices being fastened under the tube-train carriage floors, and
later realise what had really happened, and was starting to talk about it?
Did THEY (The Hierarchy Enslaving You) publicly execute him, to shut him up,
and as a warning to others to keep their mouths shut?
We have been unable to find out where he worked. We know about his cousins
who live in London, and his family coming over from Brazil, but we do not
know where he worked.
Why?
Who is the person calling himself Richard Jones, and claiming to have been
next to the suicide-bomber on the bus, and a witness to the bus-bombing, and
why did he tell so many lies? Why did Peter Power smirk, grin and giggle,
when he spoke about the "coincidence", that the exercise had turned out to
be real, when lots of people had been killed and injured?
What is funny about that?
The probability of the 7/7/2005 Drill and Attack Coinciding, without being
planned to coincide, in a 10 year period is:
ONE chance in
3,715,592,613,265,750,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

Comment:
This is absolutely mind-boggling. The chances for these two events taking
place at the same time, let alone in the same locations, are astronomical
(numbers so big we had to look up how to say them). And these estimates are
within a very conservative five year mean.
In other words, most statistical
analysis that is designed to create the impression of a similarly incredible
improbability is usually framed within a greater amount of time: 50 years
since England began experiencing bombings, 130 years since the Tube first
opened, etc. We don't need to frame these results in that way, because the
chance is so low, that these events would ever occur simultaneously, without
some sort of intervention, that one might go so far as to call it
impossible.

In context:
If I go to a beach, or a desert, or under the sea and pick a single grain of
sand. What chance is there of you going to the same part of the world, by
chance, and picking up the same grain? You are trillions of times more
likely to do this, than the London drill coinciding with this attack at that
hour.
I wonder why the media aren't investigating the drill??
Why are,
...not under investigation
for these horrendous crimes?
"CONCLUSION"
The times of the trains and tube-trains,
on that day, have been carefully checked. The first train after 07:40 AM
left Luton at 07:56 AM, and arrived at King's Cross Thameslink Station at
08:42 AM.
The three tube trains that
blew up left Kings' Cross underground station at:
08:35 AM - the Eastbound
Circle line train (204)
08:42 AM - the Westbound Circle line
train (216)
08:48 AM - the Piccadilly Line train south.
It was therefore impossible for any of the four accused Muslims to have
caught the tube trains that blew up.
If we have at least three of the four "suicide bombers" being shot-dead at
Canary Wharf, and we KNOW they weren't on the tube-trains, because the 07:40
AM train from Luton to King's Cross was cancelled that day, and the photo of
them outside Luton Station at 07:21:54 AM is a fake, and that Hasib Hussain
was part of the mock-terrorism exercise, then we have overwhelming proof
that the four accused Muslims were patsies, and are innocent, and that it
was an inside-job, and that, like Lee Harvey Oswald, they too have been
murdered, to silence them.
Whether the bombings were done by MI5, the Israeli Mossad, or both of them,
and/or others has yet to be determined, but the one thing we can be sure of,
is that it was NOT done by four young Muslims.
"EPILOGUE"
Hopefully, amongst the security-services,
there must be at least some decent, honest people who know that the official
story is a pack of lies, and are troubled by it. Unfortunately they are all
keeping quiet about it.
We need them to have the courage to come forward,
and say what they know, and arrest their evil colleagues, and bring them to
justice, if they don't want to be also condemned as accomplices of the
government and media criminals who committed treason, and mass-murder that
day, and helped to cover it up, enabling the Orwellian Big Brother Police
State plans for Britain to pick up steam, and the real perpetrators, the New
World Order government-terrorists, to plunge the world into World War 3, and
Armageddon.
Why do you think THEY have made a Big Brother TV program, to program
people's minds and get them used to the idea of living under constant
surveillance, and to like it, and volunteer to take part in it?
Why do you think they are called PROGRAMS?
It is because they are used for mind-control, brainwashing, programming of
the public's minds, into obeying, and sleep-walking, whilst following their
New World Order hidden agenda.
The sleeper must awaken. The sleeper must awaken.
The
television is the greatest mind-control and propaganda weapon ever
invented.
-
Do you think you should be paying for a TV license to fund all THEIR
programming of YOUR mind and the lies and propaganda they are broadcasting
to deceive, brainwash, control and enslave everyone, including you?
-
Does the
TV, and watching it, not already control most of your life and the way you
think?
-
Do you think you should be paying for all those CCTV cameras and their
operatives to spy on you, everywhere you go, so they can enslave you, and
fine you, thereby stealing your money, for doing nothing wrong?
-
Especially
when they use your own money from those fines and taxes to pay for even more CCTV cameras, so you have even less privacy and freedom, and then they claim
that the cameras do not work, when there is a real crime being committed, by
the people who control the cameras?
-
Don't you realize that, in paying fines and taxes, you are actually paying
for the chains they are using to enslave you with?
Wake up, look and see the
reality, that you are actually paying for them to turn you into their slave.
The government is continually and illegally passing new legislation, to
restrict your freedom and obtain more and more information about you, to
control you, and yet, they themselves are becoming more and more secretive,
and out of control. They have turned the relationship between the people and
government, into the opposite of what it should be.
It should be, public
servants serving the people, not the people serving public government
masters, or, more accurately, dictators.
