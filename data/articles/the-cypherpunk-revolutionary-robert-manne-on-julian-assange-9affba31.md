ESSAY
Assange was the overwhelming winner of the
popular vote for Time magazine's "Person of the Year" and Le Monde's less
politically correct "Man of the Year".
If Rupert Murdoch, who turns 80 this
month, is the most influential Australian of the postwar era, Julian Assange,
who will soon turn 40, is undoubtedly the most consequential Australian of
the present time.
Murdoch's importance rests in his responsibility for injecting, through Fox
News, the poison of rabid populist conservatism into the political culture
of the United States; Assange's in the revolutionary threat his idea of
publishing damaging documentary information sent by anonymous insiders to
WikiLeaks poses to governments and corporations across the globe.
Julian Assange has told the story of his childhood and adolescence twice,
most recently to a journalist from the New Yorker, Raffi Khatchadourian, and
some 15 years ago, secretly but in greater detail, to Suelette Dreyfus, the
author of a fascinating book on the first generation of computer hacking,
Underground, for which Assange was the primary researcher.
In what is called
the "Researcher's Introduction", Assange begins with a cryptic quote from
Oscar Wilde,
"Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him
a mask, and he will tell you the truth."
Nothing about Assange has ever been
straightforward.
One of the main characters in Underground is the Melbourne
hacker Mendax. Although there is no way readers at that time could have
known it, Mendax is Julian Assange.
Putting Khatchadourian and Dreyfus together, and adding a little detail from
a blog that Assange published on the internet in 2006-07 and checking it
against common sense and some material that has emerged since his rise to
fame, the story of Assange's childhood and adolescence can be told in some
detail.
There is, however, a problem. Journalists as senior as
David Leigh
of the Guardian or John F Burns of the New York Times in general accept on
trust many of Assange's stories about himself. They do not understand that
their subject is a fabulist.
By contrast, when Daniel Domscheit-Berg,
Assange's lieutenant at WikiLeaks between late 2007 and September 2010,
heard that Assange was writing an autobiography he tells us in Inside
WikiLeaks that his "first thought" was that it should be placed "in the
fiction section".
According to Assange, his mother left her Queensland home for Sydney at the
age of 17, around 1970, at the time of the anti-Vietnam War movement when
the settled culture of the western world was breaking up. In Dreyfus,
Assange's mother is not named; in Khatchadourian, she is called "Claire". In
fact she was Christine Hawkins. Assange told Dreyfus that his mother's
parents were both "academics".
This seems a little grandiose. Christine's
father, Warren Hawkins, was the principal of the Northern Rivers College of
Advanced Education. Christine fell in love with a man called John Shipton in
Sydney. A year or so after Julian was born, in Townsville, they parted.
Assange did not meet Shipton again till he was 25.
When Julian was about one, Christine met and married a roving theatrical
producer and member of what was by now called the counterculture, Brett
Assange. According to what Julian told Khatchadourian, Brett was the
descendant of a Chinese immigrant who had settled on Thursday Island, Ah
Sang or Mr Sang.
Together Brett and Christine travelled around the country,
performing. He painted a vivid portrait for Khatchadourian of an idyllic
life after the family settled for a time on Magnetic Island.
"Most of this
time was pretty Tom Sawyer. I had my own horse. I built my own raft. I went
fishing. I was down mine shafts and tunnels."
To Dreyfus, Julian claimed his
stepfather was a decent man but also an alcoholic.
By the time he was
addressing audiences worldwide, his father - he could only be referring to
Brett Assange - had become idealized as a "good and generous man" who had
taught him the most fundamental lesson in life: to nurture victims rather
than to create them.
Assange also told Dreyfus about a foundational
political memory, an incident that had occurred while he was about four. His
mother and a male friend had discovered evidence concerning the British
atomic bomb tests that had taken place in
Maralinga in greatest secrecy,
which they intended to give to an Adelaide journalist.
The male friend had
been beaten by police to silence him. Christine had been warned that she was
in danger of being charged with being "an unfit mother". She was advised to
stay out of politics. For a four year old to grasp the political meaning of
an encounter such as this seems a little improbable.
When Julian was eight or nine years old, Christine and Brett Assange
separated and then divorced. His mother now formed a "tempestuous"
relationship with an amateur musician, Keith Hamilton, with whom she had
another child, a boy.
To Dreyfus, Julian described Hamilton as a
"manipulative and violent psychopath". A bitter battle for the custody of
Julian's half-brother began.
Christine's family was now once more on the
move - this time not as before on a "happy-go-lucky odyssey", but hiding on
both sides of the continent in permanent terror. To Khatchadourian but not
Dreyfus, Julian claimed there was evidence that this man was a member of the
Anne Hamilton-Byrne cult
The Family and, rather fancifully, that he probably
discovered their whereabouts from the "moles" that the cult had inside the
government.
Because of his itinerant life as a child, and also because his
mother was suspicious of the authoritarian culture of formal schooling,
Julian claimed that he was home-schooled or independently educated either by
professors encountered on their travels or by following his curiosity in
public libraries. He did, however, also claim to have attended "very many
schools.
According to Dreyfus, by the time Mendax was 15 he "had lived in a
dozen different places" and had "enrolled in at least as many different
schools".
His lawyer in his trial of 1996, Paul Galbally, also told the
court Assange had been enrolled in about 12 schools. By 2006, Assange
claimed he had attended 37 different schools. Given that after his rise to
fame the Northern Star reported that he had attended Lismore's Goolmangar
Primary School between 1979 and 1983, the story of 37 schools seems
unlikely.
One of the schools Julian attended was in rural Victoria.
In the blog he
posted on 18 July 2006, there is an account of his and another outsider's
experience at this school.
We were bright sensitive kids who didn't fit into the dominant subculture
and fiercely castigated those who did as irredeemable boneheads.
This unwillingness to accept the authority of a peer group considered
risible was not appreciated. I was quick to anger and brutal statements such
as "You're a bunch of mindless apes out of Lord of the Flies" when faced
with stand-over tactics were enough to ensure I got into a series of extreme
fights and I wasn't sorry to leave when presented with the dental bills of
my tormentors.
Eventually Julian's family settled on the outskirts of Melbourne in Emerald
and then Teeoma, according to Dreyfus.
Christine bought Julian a $700
computer and a modem. Assange fell in love with a 16-year-old girl, Teresa,
whom he had met through a program for gifted children. He left home, moved
in with and then married his girlfriend. They had a son. This was the period
when the underground subculture of hacking was forming in Melbourne.
Around
1988 Assange joined this subculture, under the handle Mendax. By October
1989 an attack was mounted from Australia on the NASA computer system via
the introduction of what was called the WANK worm in an attempt to sabotage
the
Jupiter launch of the Galileo rocket as part of an action of
anti-nuclear activists.
No one claimed responsibility for this attack, which
is outlined in the first chapter of Underground, In an article he later
published in the left-wing magazine CounterPunch, Assange would claim the
WANK worm attack was "the origin of hacktivism".
In a Swedish television
documentary, WikiRebels, made with Assange's co-operation, there are hints
he was responsible.

Mendax formed a closed group with two other hackers Trax and Prime Suspect.
They called themselves the International Subversives. According to Dreyfus,
their politics was fiercely anti-establishment; their motive adventure and
intellectual curiosity; their strict ethic not to profit by their hacking or
to harm the computers they entered.
Mendax wrote a program called Sycophant.
It allowed the International Subversives to conduct "massive attacks on the
US military". The list of the computers they could recall finding their way
into "read like a Who's Who of the American military-industrial complex".
Eventually Mendax penetrated the computer system of the Canadian
telecommunications corporation Nortel. It was here that his hacking was
first discovered.
The Australian Federal Police conducted a long
investigation into the International Subversives, Operation Weather.
Eventually Trax lost his nerve and began to talk. He told the police that
the International Subversives had been hacking on a scale never achieved
before. In October 1991 the Australian Federal Police raided Prime Suspect's
and Mendax' homes.
They found Assange in a state of near mental collapse.
His young wife had recently left him, taking their son Daniel.
Assange told
Dreyfus that he had been dreaming incessantly of,
"police raids... of
shadows in the pre-dawn darkness, of a gun-toting police squad bursting
through his backdoor at 5 a.m."
When the police arrived, the incriminating
disks, which he had been in the habit of hiding inside a beehive, were
scattered by his computer. The evidence was removed.
Assange descended into a personal hell.
He entered a psychiatric ward
briefly. He tried and failed to return home to live with his mother. He
frequently slept along Merri Creek in Melbourne or in Sherbrooke Forest. He
told Dreyfus that 1992 was "the worst year in his life". The formal charges
against Assange were not laid until July 1994. His case was not finally
settled until December 1996.
Although Assange had been speaking in secretive
tones about the technical possibility of a massive prison sentence, in the
end he received a $5000 good behavior bond and a $2100 reparations fine.
The experience of arrest and trial nonetheless scarred his soul and helped
shape his politics.
In his blog of 17 July 2006, Assange wrote:
If there is a book whose feeling captures me it is First Circle by
Solzhenitsyn. To feel that home is the comraderie [sic] of persecuted, and
in fact, prosecuted, polymaths in a Stalinist labor camp! How close the
parallels to my own adventures!...
Such prosecution in youth is a defining
peak experience. To know the state far what it really is!
To see through
that veneer the educated swear to disbelieve in but still slavishly follow
with their hearts!... True belief only begins with a jackboot at the door.
True belief forms when lead [sic] into the dock and referred to in the third
person. True belief is when a distant voice booms "the prisoner shall now
rise" and no one else in the room stands.
This is a characteristically self-dramatizing passage.
Solzhenitsyn was
incarcerated in the Gulag Archipelago, harassed for years by the KGB and
eventually expelled from the Soviet Union. Assange was investigated by the
AFP and received a good behavior bond and a fine.
Before his trial, Julian Assange was extremely sensitive about his
reputation. In 1994 he offered to assist the director of Dogs in Space,
Richard Lowenstein, with a film he was thinking of making about hackers.
Assange spoke about the 290 years he might theoretically spend in prison. He
learned that Lowenstein had not kept this information confidential.
He was
furious. He sent Lowenstein a series of threatening emails in which he
outlined details of Lowenstein's sexual life. Lowenstein protested. Had Assange no understanding of the concept of privacy?
Privacy, Assange
replied, is "relative".
"I could monitor your keystrokes, intercept your
phone and bug your residence. If I could be bothered... As one who's has
[sic] one's life monitored pretty closely, you quickly come to the
realization that trying to achieve complete privacy is impossible."
If
Lowenstein wanted to keep details of his life confidential he should use
encrypted email.
Lowenstein told Assange he had not realized that the
information was confidential.
"I do not doubt your reasons were not
malicious. Stupidity, ignorance and lack of respect come to mind. You seem
to think I have only one life. I have many."
While awaiting trial, Julian Assange began to try to reconstruct his life.
One overwhelming preoccupation was the bitter struggle waged for the custody
of his son, Daniel. In their struggle, Julian and Christine Assange formed a
small activist group - Parent Inquiry into Child Protection. They found
sources of support inside the Victorian Department of Health and Community
Services. An insider provided them with a document of great value to their
cause - an internal departmental manual outlining the current rules
determining custody disputes.
It is almost certainly from this experience
that Assange became seriously interested in the political possibilities of
leaks. He told Dreyfus that in his fight against government corruption in
Victoria he had "acted as a conduit for leaked documents".
On several
occasions recently, Assange has claimed that while he registered a domain
site in 1999 known as "leaks.org" he did nothing with it. This cannot be
accurate.
In November 1996 he sent the following enigmatic message to those
on certain email lists he had created.
A few pointy heads in Canberra have been considering your moderator's
continued existence. Consequentially I've been called on to justify labour
and resources spent on all projects under my control, particularly those
chat can't easily be quantified such as IQ, BOS, LACC, IS, LEAKS...
All these lists were connected to an internet service provider, Suburbia
Public Access Network, that Assange had taken over when its original owner,
Mark Dorset, went to live in Sydney.
He likened it to a "low cost
power-to-the-people enabling technology". Suburbia was the vehicle for
several email lists - Interesting Questions (IQ), Best of Security (BoS),
Legal Aspects of Computer Crime (LACC), Inside-Source (IS) and, presumably,
LEAKS - that Assange created.
It was also the free site for several groups
of Melbourne activists, artists and others - the Powerline Action Group; the
Alternative Technology Association; the Centre for Contemporary Photography;
the Australian Public Access Network Association and, strangely enough, the
Private Inquiry Agents Association.
It is because of the continued existence
on the internet of some of the commentary he wrote for these lists in his
mid twenties that we can begin to hear, for the first time, the distinctive
political voice of Julian Assange. In general, it is intelligent and
assured.
One of Suburbia's clients had published some of the
Church of
Scientology's holy scriptures. The church threatened legal action against
Suburbia. The client, Dave Gerard, fought back.
In March 1996, Assange
issued an appeal to join an anti-Scientology protest.
What you have then is a Church based on brainwashing yuppies and other
people with more money than sense ... If Nicole Kiddman [sic], Kate Cerbrano
[sic], John Travolta, Burce [sic] Willis, Demi Moore and Tom Cruise want to
spend their fortunes on learning that the earth is in reality the destroyed
prison colony of aliens from outer space then so be it. However, money
brings power and attracts the corrupt...
Their worst critic at the moment
is not a personal or an organization but a medium - the Internet. The
Internet is by its very nature a censorship free zone... The fight against'
the Church is far more than the Net versus a bunch of wackos.
It is about
corporate suppression of the Internet and free speech. It is about
intellectual property and the big and rich versus the small and smart.
At this time, to judge by the pieces he wrote that have survived, Assange's
main political preoccupation seems to have been the extraordinary democratic
possibilities of the information.sharing virtual communities across the
globe created by the internet, and the threat to its freedom and flourishing
posed by censorious states, greedy corporations and repressive laws.
Not everything Assange wrote at this time was serious. He was interested in
a computer security software program developed by Dan Farmer of Silicon
Graphics known as SATAN.
One evening in April 1995 he composed 'The Dan
Farmer Rap' for 'firewalls', a list to which he subscribed.
I'm Dan Farmer you can't fool me
The only security consultant to be an MTV,
I've got red hair - hey hands off man! don't touch the lacks of the mighty
Dan.
AC/DC - from the front or from behind, you can fuck my arse but you
can't touch my mind.
philosophy's the trip - evil 'n' stuff, gad, we know a lot, Mike me and
Muff.
A real ardent feminist - just like she tells me to be,
See me out there rooting for sexual e-qual-ity ...
I coded it all - yes the mighty Dan did it alone,
if you can't believe it, you and your note pad can fuck off home.
I'm Dan Farmer - now take that down
it's not every day you get to interview
the world's biggest security clown.
Several subscribers to 'firewalls' were appalled.
One wrote:
"Just reading
this made me feel dirty. In 20+ years associated with this business, I don't
think I've ever seen debate among professionals degraded to quite this
slime-ball level. Mr Assange is an unprincipled ass..."
Assange wrote a
sort of apology.
"It was perhaps an error of judgment on my behalf to equate
the people on this list with those who knew myself and Dan more fully. Such
mistakes are ripe to happen when one is merry and full of wine in the wee
hours of the morning."
Nonetheless, he expressed high amusement regarding
all those who had publicly condemned him while privately sending their
congratulations.
"You know who you are."
Assange's Dan Farmer 'peccadillo'
was still remembered six years later by a British computer geek, Danny
O'Brien.
By 1997 Julian Assange, with his friends Suelette Dreyfus and Ralf Weinmann,
had written 'Rubberhose', a piece of 'deniable cryptography' for human
rights activists and troublemakers, the purpose of which was to make it
impossible for torturers or their victims to know whether all the encrypted
data on a computer hard drive had been revealed. It was designed to make
torture to extract passwords pointless, and defection and betrayal in the
face of such torture impossible.
The concept was Assange's. Assange argued a
convoluted and rather improbable psychological case about why Rubberhose
would cause rational torturers to put away their weapons. Danny O'Brien
captured the obvious objection rather well.
Despite Rubberhose's deniable
cryptography,
"won't rational torturers just beat you up 'forever'?"
l am in no position to judge the sophistication of the Rubberhose software
or the level of creativity it required.
I can however assess the quality of
the posting announcing its creation, which Assange sent to the firewalls
list in June 1997. Assange called it "One Man's Search for a Cryptographic
Mythology".
His search to find a suitable name for Rubberhose takes him, in
a zany and hilarious stream of consciousness,
-
on a journey through Greek and
Roman mythology, the incestuous Cerberus and the clichéd Janus
-
to the moral
pessimism of David Hume, who argued the inescapable connection between joy
and despondency
-
to an unexplained rejection of his request for mythological
advice by the Princeton History Department
-
to Sigmund Freud, the Medusa's
Head and the castration complex
-
to a spoof on Zen Buddhism
-
to a memory of
a visit to a mercenary hypnotherapist in Melbourne's Swanston Street -
until, through the suggestion of a Swedish friend with an interest in
ancient Sumerian mythology - "who calls himself Elk on odd days and Godflesh
on even days
Don't ask why" - he finally arrives with a joyous heart at the
Mesopotamian god MARUTUKKU, "Master of the Arts of Protection".
If MARUTUKKU was my exquisite cryptographic good, of wit, effusive joy,
ravishing pleasure and flattering hope; then where was the counter point?
The figure to its ground - the sharper evil, the madness, the melancholy,
the most cruel lassitudes and disgusts and the severest disappointments. Was
Hume right?
Alas, he was. Assange, "on a cold and wintry night here in Melbourne",
discovers in the 4000-year-old Babylonian tablets a reference to the
supposedly secret eavesdropping intelligence agency in Maryland, the
National Security Agency!
It is a magnificently exuberant, bravura literary
performance. Assange was not merely a talented code writer and computer
geek. There was in him daring, wildness and a touch of genius. For a while
he signed his emails not with his customary "Proff." but "Prof. Julian
Assange".
Assange was by now a committed member of the free software movement,
pioneered by Richard Stallman, whose aim was to regulate communication in
cyberspace by software not by law. As members of the movement put it,
freedom here meant free speech rather than free beer. The movement stressed
democratic, collective contribution.
Assange tended to be somewhat skeptical about the movement, on one occasion
arguing that in reality usually one or two people did 80% of the work.
Assange was nonetheless involved in the development of
NetBSD, an open
source computer operating system derived from the original Berkeley Software
Distribution source code. Some of the slogans he invented to spruik its
virtues can still be found on the internet.
Here are three.
"We put the OS
in OrgaSm"
"Bits for Tits"
"More ports than a Norwegian crack whore"
By the time Assange was working on NetBSD he had been involved for several
years with a movement known as the cypherpunks.
It was the cypherpunks more
than the free software movement who provided him with his political
education. Although there are tens of thousands of articles on Julian
Assange in the world's newspapers and magazines, no mainstream journalist so
far has grasped the critical significance of the cypherpunks movement to
Assange's intellectual development and the origin of WikiLeaks.
The cypherpunks emerged from a meeting of minds in late 1992 in the Bay Area
of San Francisco.
Its founders were,
-
Eric Hughes, a brilliant Berkeley
mathematician
-
Timothy C May, an already wealthy, former chief scientist at
Intel who had retired at the age of 34
-
John Gilmore, another already
retired and wealthy computer scientist - once number five at Sun
Microsystems - who had co-founded an organization to advance the cause of
cyberspace freedom, the Electronic Frontier Foundation
They created a small
group, which met monthly in Gilmore's office at a business he had created,
Cygnus.
At one of the early meetings of the group, an editor at Mondo 2000,
Jude Milhon, jokingly called them cypherpunks, a play on cyberpunk, the
"hi-tech, low-life" science-fiction genre.
The name stuck. It soon referred
to a vibrant emailing list, created shortly after the first meeting, which
had grown to 700 by 1994 and perhaps 2000 by 1997 with by then up to a
hundred postings per day. It also referred to a distinctive subculture -
eventually there were cypherpunk novels, Snowcrash, Cryptonomicon, Indecent
Communications; a cypherpunk porno film, Cryptic Seduction; and even a
distinctive cypherpunks dress: broad-brimmed black hats.
Most importantly,
however, it referred to a political-ideological crusade.
At the core of the cypherpunk philosophy was the belief that the great
question of politics in the age of the internet was whether the state would
strangle individual freedom and privacy through its capacity for electronic
surveillance or whether autonomous individuals would eventually undermine
and even destroy the state through their deployment of electronic weapons
newly at hand.
Many cypherpunks were optimistic that in the battle for the
future of humankind - between the State and the Individual - the individual
would ultimately triumph. Their optimism was based on developments in
intellectual history and computer software: the invention in the mid 1970s
of public-key cryptography by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, and the
creation by Phil Zimmerman in the early 1990s of a program known as PGP,
'Pretty Good Privacy'.
The seminal historian of codes, David Kahn, argued
that the Diffie-Hellman invention represented the most important development
in cryptography since the Renaissance. Zimmerman's PGP program democratized
their invention and provided individuals, free of cost, with access to
public-key cryptography and thus the capacity to communicate with others in
near-perfect privacy.
Although George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four was one
of the cypherpunks' foundational texts, because of the combination of
public-key cryptography and PGP software, they tended to believe that in the
coming battle between Big Brother and Winston Smith, the victor might be
Winston Smith.
At the time the cypherpunks formed, the American government strongly opposed
the free circulation of public-key cryptography. It feared that making it
available would strengthen the hands of the espionage agencies of America's
enemies abroad and of terrorists, organized criminals, drug dealers and
pornographers at home.
For the cypherpunks, the question of whether
cryptography would be freely available would determine the outcome of the
great battle of the age. Their most important practical task was to write
software that would expand the opportunities for anonymous communication
made possible by public-key cryptography.
One of the key projects of the cypherpunks was 'remailers', software systems that made it impossible for
governments to trace the passage from sender to receiver of encrypted email
traffic.
Another key project was 'digital cash', a means of disguising
financial transactions from the state.
Almost all cypherpunks were anarchists who regarded the state as the enemy.
Most but not all were anarchists of the Right, or in American parlance,
libertarians, who supported laissez-faire capitalism. The most authoritative
political voice among the majority libertarian cypherpunks was Tim May, who,
in 1994, composed a vast, truly remarkable document, "Cyphernomicon".
May
called his system crypto-anarchy. He regarded crypto-anarchy as the most
original contribution to political ideology of contemporary times. May
thought the state to be the source of evil in history. He envisaged the
future as an Ayn Rand utopia of autonomous individuals dealing with each
other as they pleased.
Before this future arrived, he advocated tax
avoidance, insider trading, money laundering, markets for information of all
kinds, including military secrets and what he called assassination markets
not only for those who broke contracts or committed serious crime but also
for state officials and the politicians he called "Congressrodents".
He recognized that in his future world only elites with control over technology
would prosper. No doubt "the clueless 95%" - whom he described as "inner
city breeders" and as "the unproductive, the halt and the lame" - "would
suffer, but that is only just". May acknowledged that many cypherpunks would
regard these ideas as extreme.
He also acknowledged that, while the
overwhelming majority of cypherpunks were, like him, anarcho-capitalist
libertarians, some were strait-laced Republicans, left-leaning liberals,
Wobblies or even Maoists. Neither fact concerned him.
The cypherpunks formed
a house of many rooms. The only thing they all shared was an understanding
of the political significance of cryptography and the willingness to fight
for privacy and unfettered freedom in cyberspace. Like an inverse Marxist,
Tim May tended to believe that the inexorable expansion of private
cryptography made the victory of crypto-anarchism inevitable.
A new "balance
of power between individuals and larger entities" was already emerging. He
predicted with some confidence "the end of governments as we know them".
Another even more extreme cypherpunk of the libertarian Right, Jim Bell,
like an inverse Leninist, thought that history might need a push. In mid
1995, drawing upon May's recommendation of assassination markets, he began a
series explaining his "revolutionary idea", which he called "Assassination
Politics".
These were perhaps the most notorious and controversial postings
in the history of the cypherpunks list.
Bell devised a system in which
citizens could contribute towards a lottery fund for the assassination of
particular government officials. The prize would go to the person who
correctly predicted the date of the death.
The winner would obviously be the
official's murderer.
However, through the use of public-key cryptography,
remailers and digital cash, from the time they entered the competition to
the collection of the prize no one except the murderer would be aware of
their identity. Under the rubric "tax is theft" all government officials and
politicians were legitimate targets of assassination.
Journalists would
begin to ask of politicians,
"why should you not be killed?"
As prudence
would eventually dictate that no one take the job, the state would simply
wither away.
Moreover, as assassination lotteries could be extended across
borders, no leader would again risk taking their people to war. Eventually,
through the idea of the assassination lottery, then, not only would the era
of anarchy arise across the globe, the condition of permanent peace
humankind had long dreamt of would finally come to pass.
Bell ended his
20,000 word series of postings with these words.
"Is all this wishful
thinking? I really don't know."
A year or so later he was arrested on tax
avoidance charges.
Julian Assange joined the cypherpunks email list in late 1995 at the time
the controversy over "Assassination Politics" was raging.
There were many
reasons Assange was likely to be attracted to the cypherpunks. As his
encounter with Richard Lowenstein had revealed, he was already interested in
the connection between privacy and encrypted communication. Even before his
arrest he had feared the intrusion into his life of the totalitarian
surveillance state. An atmosphere of paranoia pervaded the cypherpunks list.
Assange believed that he had been wrongly convicted of what he called a
"victimless crime".
The struggle against victimless crimes - the right to
consume pornography, to communicate in cyberspace anonymously, to distribute
cryptographic software freely - was at the centre of the cypherpunks'
political agenda. Moreover the atmosphere of the list was freewheeling -
racism, sexism, homophobia were common. Not only Tim May believed that
political correctness had turned Americans into "a nation of sheep".
On the cypherpunks list no one would disapprove of "The Dan Farmer rag".
Yet there
was probably more to it than all this. Cypherpunks saw themselves as Silicon
Valley Masters of the Universe. It must have been more than a little
gratifying for a self-educated antipodean computer hacker, who had not even
completed high school, to converse on equal terms with professors of
mathematics, whiz-kid businessmen and some of the leading computer
code-writers in the world.
Julian Assange contributed to the cypherpunks list from December 1995 until
June 2002. As it happens, almost all his interventions have been placed on
the internet. On the basis of what historians call primary evidence, the
mind and character of Julian Assange can be seen at the time of his
obscurity.
The first thing that becomes dear is the brashness. Over a technical
dispute, he writes:
"[B]oy are you a dummy."
When someone asks for
assistance in compiling a public list of hackers with handles, names, email
addresses, Assange responds:
"Are you on this list of morons?"
In a dispute
over religion and intolerance one cypherpunk had written:
"Because those
being hatefully intolerant have the 'right' beliefs as to what the Bible
says. Am I a racist if I don't also include an example from the Koran?"
"No,
just an illiterate", Assange replied.
Following a savaging from Assange for
total computer incompetence, a hapless cypherpunk pointed out that he has
been writing code since the age of 14.
If one thing is clear from the cypherpunks list, it is that the young Julian Assange did not suffer those
he regarded as fools gladly.
In his posts there is humor, although often it is sarcastic. In one of his
earliest interventions Assange has read about the arrest of someone caught
with diesel fuel and fertilizer.
"Looks like I've just been placed into the
ranks of the pyro-terrorist. Golly, Deisel [sic] fuel. Gosh, Fertilizer. Ma,
other items."
Some posts reflect his faith in the theory of evolution.
Assange forwarded an article about the role played by the CIA in supplying
crack gangs in Los Angeles. A cypherpunk responded:
"I wish they'd get back
to the business, but add an overt poison to the product. Clean out the shit
from the cities. Long live Darwinism."
"Darwinism is working as well as it
ever was. You may not like it but shit is being selected for," Assange shot
back.
Other posts reflect his recent life experiences.
Assange had helped
Victoria Police break a pedophile ring in 1993. On the cypherpunks list he
defended the circulation of child pornography on the internet on the grounds
that it would cut the need for new production and make it easier for police
to capture pedophiles. In another post he expressed deep anger at perceived
injustice regarding those with whom he identifies - convicted hackers.
One,
Tsutomu Shimamura, had not only played a role in the hunting down of a
notorious American fellow hacker, Kevin Mitnick (known personally to Assange
through his research for Underground), but had even co-authored a book about
it, Takedown.
"This makes me ill. Tsutomu, when Mitnick cracks will you dig
up his grave and rent his hands out as ash trays?"
Assange also posted on
the reports of violence against another hacker, Ed Cummings AKA Bernie S,
imprisoned in the US.
"I was shocked. I've had some dealings with the SS...
Those that abuse their power and inflict grave violence on others must be
held accountable and their crimes deplored and punished in the strongest
manner. Failure to do so merely creates an environment where such behavior
becomes predominant."
Already there are qualities in Assange's postings unusual in the standard
cypherpunk.
One is a fascination with language. Assange acquired a software
program that created anagrams. The deepest institutional enemy of the
cypherpunks was the National Security Agency.
Assange put the name into his
computer. Among the anagrams that emerged were:
"National Anti-Secrecy Guy"
"Secret Analytic Guy Union"
"Caution Laying Any Secret"
"Insane, ugly,
acne atrocity",
...and, Assange's apparent favorite:
"National Gay Secrecy
Unit".
He was also interested in what he described as "tracking language
drift; i.e. the relative change in word frequency on the internet as time
goes by".
He informed the cypherpunks that he had just discovered that in a
"10 billion word corpus" the following frequency occurred:
-
God - 2.177,242
-
America - 2,178,046
-
Designed - 2,181,106
-
Five - 2,189,194
-
December - 2,190,028
His eccentricity would also have been obvious after a member of the
'firewalls' list forwarded his MARUTUKKU fantasia to cypherpunks.
Where did Assange stand with regard to the radical cypherpunks agenda of Tim
May? This question is best answered in two parts. On the question of
cryptographic freedom and hostility towards the surveillance state and its
chief embodiment -
the National Security Agency - Assange was, if anything,
even more absolute and extreme than May.
In September 1996, Esther Dyson,
the chair of the lobby group for freedom in cyberspace, the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as being in favor
of certain extremely limited restrictions on internet anonymity. On the cypherpunks list a furious controversy, called "The Esther Dyson Fuss",
broke out.
Some cypherpunks defended Dyson on the ground that she had every
right to argue a more nuanced position and that it was anyhow healthy for
individuals to speak their mind. May vehemently disagreed. The issue was not
her freedom of speech. A critical moment in the battle between freedom and
surveillance had arrived.
Dyson had defected to the enemy camp.
Assange went
further. He launched a stinging ad hominem attack.
Examining in detail Dyson's interests it appears she maintains a sizeable
and longstanding interest in East European technology companies. She is also
very far to the right of the political spectrum (rampant capitalist would be
putting it mildly). She also speaks Russian.
I'm not saying she's been
working for the CIA for the past decade, but I would be very surprised if
the CIA has not exerted quite significant pressure... in order to bring her
into their folds during that time period.
"At least you don't accuse me of being a Communist," Dyson responded. "For
the record, I am not a tool of the CIA nor have they pressured me, but
there's no reason for you to believe me."
Perhaps Dyson remembered the
incident.
When Assange was in trouble last year she wrote a piece on the
Salon website arguing that even unpleasant characters need to be defended.
A month or so after September 11 a controversy broke out on the cypherpunks
list over the report of a civilized discussion about increased FBI
surveillance over internet communications between Mitch Kapor, a co-founder
and former board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Stu
Baker, an attorney who had once been employed by the National Security
Agency.
Some cypherpunks had some sympathy for Kapor's moderation. Even they
recognized that with September 11 something major had occurred.
One pointed
out, in addition, that Stu Baker was,
"a gun for hire, not a doctrinaire
blinders-on true believer for either the surveillance enthusiasts or privacy
freaks".
This was too much for Assange:
Stu is a well known NSA zealot. The only reason there's a bridge between
Kapor and Baker is due to the cavernous ravine that lays [sic] between them.
Kapor is now apparently half-way across, following Stu's silently beckoning
finger, fearfully running from the sounds of angel's wings fooled into
believing that they lie behind and not ahead of him.
From beginning to end Assange was, in short, a hard-line member of the
tendency among the cypherpunks that Tim May called the "rejectionists", an
enemy or those who displayed even the slightest tendency to compromise on
the question of Big Brother and the surveillance state.
On another question, however, Assange was at the opposite end of the
cypherpunks spectrum from Tim May. At no stage did Assange show sympathy for
the anarcho-capitalism of the cypherpunks mainstream.
In October ]996, a
prominent cypherpunk, Duncan Frissell, claimed that in the previous fiscal
year the American government had seized more tax than any government in
history.
Assange pointed out that, as the US was the world's largest economy
and that its GDP had grown in the previous rear, this was a ridiculous
statement designed to be deceptive. In October 2001, Declan McCullagh
expressed "surprise" when a "critique of laissez-faire capitalism" appeared
on the cypherpunks list "of all places".
Assange replied:
Declan, Declan.
Put away your straw man ... Nobel economic laureates have been telling us
for years to be careful about idealized market models ... This years [sic]
Nobel for Economics won by George A. Akerlof, A. Michael Spence and Joseph
E. Stiglitz "for their analysis of markets with assymmetric [sic]
information" is typical.
You don't need a Nobel to realize that the
relationship between a large employer and employee is brutally assymmetric
[sic] ... To counter this sort of assymetery. [sic]
Employees naturally
start trying to collectivize to increase their information processing and
bargaining power. That's right. UNIONS Declan. Those devious entities that
first world companies and governments have had a hand in suppressing all
over the third world by curtailing freedom of association, speech and other
basic political rights we take for granted.
Assange was, then, an absolutist crypto-anarchist but one who leant
decidedly to the Left.
Mainstream cypherpunks did not defend trade unions or
speak negatively of "rampant capitalists" and positively of "human rights
activists". He was an electronic but not an economic libertarian.
There is also evidence that Assange was increasingly repelled by the
corrosive cynicism common in cypherpunks ranks. Something in his spirit
seems to have changed after his trial and the writing of his MARUTUKKU
mythology.
From 1997 to 2002 Julian Assange accompanied all his cypherpunks
postings with this beautiful passage from Antoine de Saint-Exupery.
"If you
want to build a ship, don't drum up people together to collect wood and
don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the
endless immensity of the sea."
On one occasion in July 1999 William H Geiger
III presented standard
Ayn Rand Objectivist praise of human selfishness.
"Everyone is a predator out to advance their own agenda at the expence [sic]
of others. Tim is just more honest than most about it."
Assange replied with
a defense of altruism, for Objectivists an evil.
No... Everyone maybe self-interested. but some are self-interested in a way
that is healthy (to you, or the people you care about), some in a way which
is benign. and some in a manner that is pernicious. It is important to
distinguish between these different behaviors and support or undermine them
accordingly.
On another occasion, a cypherpunk suggested that in I the great struggle for
privacy and against censorship ordinary people could not give a damn.
Perhaps with Tim May's contempt for "the clueless 95%" in his mind, in March
2002, in what was one of his final cypherpunks postings, Assange responded:
"The 95% of the population which comprise the flock have never been my
target and neither should they be yours; it's the 2.5% at either end of the
normal that I find in my sights, one to be cherished and the other to be
destroyed."
Already he seems to have imagined the future as a struggle to
the death between autocratic elites and electronic freedom fighters.
Increasingly, Assange began to mock Tim May. Many thought of May as an
anti.Semite, with good reason. In November 2001, when May used a quote from
a cypherpunk fellow traveler, David Friedman (Milton's son), Assange
emailed:
"Quoting Jews again, Tim?"
Julian Assange was a regular contributor to the cypherpunks mailing list
particularly before its decline in late 1997 following a meltdown over the
question of the possible moderation of the list - censorship! - and the
departure of John Gilmore.
The cypherpunks list clearly mattered to him
deeply. Shortly before his travels in 1998, Assange asked whether anyone
could send him a complete archive of the list between 1992 and the present
time. While commentators have comprehensively failed to see the significance
of the cypherpunks in shaping the thought of Julian Assange, this is
something insiders to the movement understand.
When Jeanne Whalen from the
Wall Street Journal approached John Young of Cryptome in August last year,
he advised her to read the Assange cypherpunk postings he had just placed on
the internet, and also Tim May's "Cyphernomicon".
"This background has not
been explored in the WikiLeaks saga. And WikiLeaks cannot be understood
without it."
Likewise, in his mordant online article on WikiLeaks and
Assange, the influential cyberpunk novelist and author of The Hacker
Crackdown Bruce Sterling wrote:
"At last - at long last - the homemade
nitroglycerin in the old cypherpunks blast shack has gone off."
In 2003 Julian Assange seems to have considered living a more conventional
life.
He went to the University of Melbourne to study mainly mathematics and
physics. As a student of mathematics his results were mediocre. This can
hardly be explained by lack of talent.
No one worked more closely with Assange than Suelette Dreyfus.
"A geek friend of his once described Assange
as having an IQ 'in excess of 170'," she wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald
of 12 December 2010. "I suspect this could be true."
Assange claimed that he
became disillusioned with the applied maths department when he discovered
its members were working with defense authorities in the U.S. on a military
bulldozer adapted to desert conditions known as "The Grizzly Plough".
He
also claimed that visits to the ANU were thoroughly dispiriting.
On one
occasion he represented University of Melbourne students at a competition.
"At the prize ceremony, the head of ANU physics motioned to us and said,
'you are the cream of Australian physics.' I looked around and thought,
'Christ Almighty I hope he's wrong.'''
On another occasion he saw 900 senior
physicists in Canberra proudly carrying bags with the logo of the Defence
Science and Technology Organization. He described them as "snivelling
fearful conformists of woefully inferior character".
Perhaps there were other reasons for dissatisfaction. By 2004 Assange had
reached the elevated position of vice-president of the students' Mathematics
and Statistics Society and chief organizer of their Puzzle Hunt - a quiz
leading the winner to $200 of buried treasure.
He described his role as
"plot/script, general nonsense, Abstract(ion), Caesar Cipher, Disc,
Platonic, Score, Surstro:mming". Organizing a puzzle hunt was a somewhat
less engrossing ambition than planning world revolution. And towards the end
of his studies this was exactly what he was doing.
A female friend provided
the journalist Nikki Barrowclough with a vivid portrait of the atmosphere of
a share house close-by the University of Melbourne that Assange lived in at
this time.
There were beds everywhere, she says. There was even a bed in the kitchen.
This woman slept on a mattress in Assange's room, and says she would
sometimes wake up in the middle of the night to find him still glued to his
computer.
He frequently forgot to eat or sleep, wrote mathematical formulas
all over the walls and the doors, and used only red light bulbs in his room
- on the basis that early man, if waking suddenly, would see only the gentle
light of the campfire, and fall asleep again.
Between July 2006 and August 2007 - the period when WikiLeaks was being
planned and actualized - Julian Assange maintained a blog at IQ.ORG, some of
which he collected under the title "Selected Correspondence".
The
correspondence can still be found on the internet. Because of its existence,
a detailed map of his mind at the age of 35 and at the moment of WikiLeaks'
creation is available. Strangely enough, even though there are now some 27
million Google entries on Assange, so far as I am aware no one has offered
an analysis.
When Domscheit-Berg released his memoir in mid February there
was excitement around the globe at his claim that Assange had boasted about
fathering several children.
On his blog, Assange includes a photo of a
bonneted baby under the title "Those Eyes" with the caption,
"All the pink
ribbons in the world can't hide them."
She is his new daughter.
In an email
of January 2007 he asks someone who is about to publish confidential email
correspondence to remove at least the reference to IQ.ORG, which is "near my
daughters [sic] photo".
The existence of Assange's son, Daniel, is well
known. However, if any journalist had read the evidence closely we would not
have needed to wait for Domscheit-Berg to learn of at least one of Assange's
more recent "love children".
The blog reveals a young man of unusual intellectual range, ambition and
curiosity. As expected, there are references to cypherpunks and his work as
a code-writer in the free software movement.
Assange writes of his loathing
for the
"'everything which is not permitted is denied' security types" who
"make concurrent salutes to the Fuhrer, Baal and Jack Straw".
He explains
why as one of the committed developers of NetBSD he has refused to sign a
proposed contract:
"The contract as well as being an instrument of the state
is written in the demeaning language of the corporate state. It should have
been written in the language of the programmer world."
Some entries, such as
his defense of altruism, are familiar to those who have followed his
postings on the cypherpunks list.
Many others have the range and also
eccentricity revealed in his MARUTUKKU performance. There are abstract
speculations on philosophy, mathematics, neuroscience, human physiology, the
law, history and sociology.
There are also very striking and revealing extracts.
One is from a Buddhist
text from 500 BC, Ajita Kesakamhal, in defense of materialism.
"The words of
those who speak of existence after death are false, empty chatter. With the
breakup of the body, the wise and the foolish are alike annihilated,
destroyed."
Another is a wonderful story from the Nazi concentration camp.
A
Jewish inmate can save his daughter if he chooses which eye of his guard is
glass. He chooses the left eye, correctly.
His guard asks how he knew.
''
'I'm sorry,' trembled Moshe, 'but the left eye looks at me with a kindly
gleam.' ''
Assange has great interest in the history of European
totalitarianism.
One extract is a poem - "bad ... but elevated by its
monumental context" - about the atom bomb spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg:
"Even so, we did what we believed in: / Treason, yes, but with good cause."
There is also a long extract from an article about the problems besetting
those possessing super-high IQs, such as the unfulfilled genius William
James Sidis.
It concludes with these words:
"And so we see that the
explanation for the Sidis tragedy is simple. Sidis was a feral child, a true
man born into a world filled with animals - a world filled with us."
It is
not difficult to understand why this article interested him.
Entries on the blog concerning women prefigure future problems.
Some passages are awkward in a Mills & Boon kind
of way,
"a lovely girl I knew... stood for a moment fully clothed in her shower before letting the wind
and rain buffet her body as she made her tremulous approach to my door and
of course I could not turn her away."
Others are rather sinister, like his
study of the etymology of the word 'cad'.
"Caddie or cadet used to denote
the passenger of a horse-coach picked up for personal profit by the driver... So a 'cad' is a man who picks up women, profits from them and leaves
them by the road side ... Such romantic etymology is enough to make a man
want to don his oilskin and mount his horse with whip and smile at the
ready."
This coldness is striking because other passages in the
correspondence are tender.
Assange writes of meeting Antony, a country kid
he had known since they were both 14, at a mental health centre in East
Ringwood.
"His smile was shaky but characteristic. His physical edges
rounded off by weight gain and his imagination dulled... His limbs and jaw
gently shuddered with some frequency," Assange visited him later still at a
psychiatric hospital.
"When I asked about the cause of his shaking,
suggesting a dopamine antagonist, he said, 'No... If you look closely
you'll notice a number of people around here acting the same way. Julian...
we're all doing the Mont Park shuffle.' "
What is most important about the correspondence, however, is that in it we
can hear for the first time Julian Assange's distinctive political voice.
As
a former cypherpunk crypto-anarchist the enemy for him is, unsurprisingly,
that abstraction he calls the State.
"Where words have power to change, the
state tries hard to trap, burn or blank them, such is its fear of their
power."
The state represents the principle of "mendacity".
"The state does
what it can get away with."
True understanding requires the individual "to
know the state for what it really is". Yet, unlike most of his fellow cypherpunks, by now Assange unambiguously extends his idea of the state to
big business.
In thinking about the US, in one blog entry, he asks:
"What
kinds of states arc giant corporations?"
He answers in the following way.
As
executive power is wielded by a central committee; as there is unaccountable
single-party rule; as there is no freedom of speech or association, and
pervasive surveillance of movement and electronic communication", what then
do you have in that federation of giant corporations that control the US?
What else but a "United Soviet of America".
Assange is a profound
anti-communist.
But he regards power in western society as belonging to
political and economic elites offering ordinary people nothing more
nourishing than a counterfeit conception of democracy and a soul-destroying
consumption culture. He points out that when the American colonists waged
their struggle for independence there was no talk of shopping or even
democracy. Such shallow ideas could not stir the passions.
Assange's selected correspondence is addressed to a small coterie of
followers.
It involves a revolutionary call to arms.
"If we can only live
once, then let it be a daring adventure that draws on all our powers... Let
our grandchildren delight to find the start of our stories in their ears but
the endings all around in their wandering eyes."
Assange seems not
particularly interested in future political institutions or in economic
arrangements.
The revolution he speaks about is moral. He believes that
individual action can re-fashion the world. The state may do "what it can
get away with" but it does "what we let it get away with" and even "what we
let ourselves get away with, for we, in our interactions with others, form
the state".
Over the whole selected correspondence there is a quotation from
the German-Jewish revolutionary anarchist Gustav Landauer, beaten to death
by right-wing troops after the Munich soviet experiment of 1919.
"The state
is a condition, a certain relationship between human beings, a mode of
behavior. We destroy it by contracting other relationships, by behaving
differently toward one another ... We are the state and we shall continue to
be the state until we have created the institutions that form a real
community and society of men."
The question is how new institutions can be
formed.
In the struggle to create a truly human society, Assange warns his
interlocutors not to believe they can think globally but act locally. This
is an illusion. Action must be taken on a truly global scale.
He is also
witheringly contemptuous of those he calls "the typical shy intellectual".
This type is often of a noble heart, wilted by fear of conflict with
authority. The power of their intellect and noble instincts may lead them to
a courageous position, where they see the need to take up arms, but their
instinctive fear of authority then motivates them to find rationalizations
to avoid conflict.
For Assange the central political virtue is courage.
One of his favorite
sayings is:
"Courage is contagious."
He attributes it to
the Pentagon Papers
whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg. In fact it was coined by the evangelist Billy
Graham.
Assange's politics are also generational.
"Perhaps as an old man I
will take great comfort in pottering around in a lab and gently talking to
students in the summer evening and will accept suffering with insouciance.
But not now; men in their prime, if they have convictions are tasked to act
on them."
For Assange the great moving forces in history are
the need for Love and the
thirst for Truth.
In his final piece in the selected correspondence, Assange
admits that often "outcomes are treated with more reverence than Truth".
Yet just as we feel all hope is lost and we sink into the miasma, back to
the shadow world of ghosts and gods, a miracle arises, everywhere before the
direction of self interest is known, people yearn to see where its compass
points and then they hunger for truth with passion and beauty and insight
...
Here then is the truth to set them free. Free from the manipulations and
constraints of the mendacious. Free to choose their path, free to remove the
ring from their noses, free to look up into the infinite void and choose
wonder over whatever gets them through.
And before this feeling to cast
blessings on the profits and prophets of truth... on the Voltaires, the
Galileos and Principias of truth, on the Gutenbergs, Marconis and Internets
of truth, those serial killers of delusion, those brutal, driven and
obsessed miners of reality, smashing, smashing, smashing every rotten
edifice until all is ruins and the seeds of the new.
But how will the rotten edifice be smashed? On 22 November 2006 Assange
provides a link to a paper.
He tells his coterie of readers:
"No. Don't skip
to the good stuff. This is the good stuff"
He is pointing them to the
central theoretical breakthrough that led to WikiLeaks.
Julian Assange published this paper twice, the first time on 10 November
2006 under the title "State and Terrorist Conspiracies", the second time, in
more developed form, on 3 December under the title "Conspiracy as
Governance".
Stripped of its inessential mathematical
gobbledygook, its
argument goes like this. The world is at present dominated by the
conspiratorial power of authoritarian governments and big business
corporations.
As President Theodore Roosevelt understood, behind "ostensible
governments", there exists,
"an
invisible government owing no allegiance and
acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible
government, to befoul this unholy alliance between corrupt business and
corrupt politics is the first task of statesmanship."
Authoritarian
governments and corporations maintain and entrench their power through a
conspiracy.
For Assange the conspiracy involves the maintenance of a network
of links between the conspirators, some vital, some less so. Conspiracies
naturally provoke resistance.
Among revolutionaries of earlier generations
resistance has involved the attempt to break the links between the leaders
of the conspiracy by,
"assassination... killing, kidnapping, blackmailing,
or otherwise marginalizing or isolating some of the conspirators they were
connected to".
Such methods are no longer appropriate.
"The act of
assassination - the targeting of visible individuals - is the result of
mental inclinations honed for the pre-literate societies in which our
species evolved."
The new generation of revolutionaries,
"must think beyond
those who have gone before us, and discover technological changes that
embolden us with ways to act in which our forebears could not".
Contemporary conspiracies rely on unrestricted information flow to adapt to
and control their environments.
Conspirators need to be able to speak freely
to each other and to disarm resistance by spreading disinformation among I
the people they control, something they presently very successfully achieve.
Conspirators who have control over information flow are infinitely more
powerful than those who do not.
Drawing on a passage from Lord Halifax in
which political parties are described as "conspiracies against the rest of
the nation", Assange asks his readers to imagine what would happen in the
struggle between the Republican and Democratic parties in the US,
"if one of
these parties gave up their mobile phones, fax and email correspondence -
let alone the computer systems that manage their subscribes [sic], donors,
budgets, polling, call centers and direct mail campaigns".
He asks them to
think of the conspiracy as a living organism,
"a beast with arteries and
veins whose blood may be thickened and slowed until it faIls, stupefied;
unable to sufficiently comprehend and control the forces in its
environment".
Rather than attacking the conspiracy by assassinating its
leading members, he believes it can be "throttled" by cutting its
information flows.
"Later," he promises, "we will see how technology and
insights into the psychological motivations of conspirators can give us
practical methods for preventing or reducing important communication between
authoritarian conspirators, foment strong resistance to authoritarian
planning and create powerful incentives for more humane forms of
governance."
The promise is fulfilled in a blog entry of 31 December 2006.
Here he
outlines finally the idea at the core of the WikiLeaks strategy.
The more secretive or unjust an organization is, the more leaks induce fear
and paranoia in the leadership and planning coterie.
This must result in
minimization of efficient internal communications mechanisms (an increase in
cognitive 'secrecy tax') and consequent system-wide cognitive decline
resulting in decreased ability to hold onto power as the environment demands
adaptation.
Hence in a world where leaking is easy, secretive or unjust systems are
nonlinearly hit relative to open, just systems.
Since unjust systems, by
their nature induce opponents, and in many places barely have the upper
hand, leaking leaves them exquisitely vulnerable to those who seek to
replace them with more open forms of governance.
There is a direct link between Assange's cypherpunks period and the theory
behind WikiLeaks.
As we have seen, Assange joined the cypherpunks list at
the time when Jim Bell's "Assassination Politics" was being hotly discussed.
There is evidence that Assange was fascinated by the idea.
In January 1998
he had come upon an advertisement for a prize - "Scoop the Grim Reaper. Who
Will Live? Who Will Die?" - which was to be awarded to the person who
guessed on what dates certain Hollywood celebrities would die.
"Anyone
noticed this before?"
Assange posted the advertisement on the cypherpunks
list under the heading:
"Jim... Bell... lives... on...in... Hollywood".
The similarity between Bell's thought and Assange's are unmistakable.
Like
Bell, Assange was possessed by a simple "revolutionary idea" about
how to
create a better world.
As with Bell, the idea emerged from reflection upon
the political possibilities created by untraceable anonymous communication,
through the use of remailers and unbreakable public-key cryptography. The
differences are also clear. Unlike with Bell, the revolution Assange
imagined would be non-violent. The agent of change would not be the assassin
but the whistleblower.
The method would not be the bullet but the leak.
"Conspiracy as Governance" can most accurately be interpreted as his answer
to "Assassination Politics".
In arriving at this position, Assange had drawn together three different
personal experiences. From his custody battles in the 1990s he had become
interested in the political potency of leaks.
From his cypherpunk days he
had become interested in the political possibilities of untraceable
encrypted communication. And from his involvement in the free software
movement he had seen what collective democratic intellectual enterprise
might achieve. In essence, his conclusion was that world politics could be
transformed by staunching the flow of information among corrupt power elites
by making them ever more fearful of insider leaks.
He believed he could
achieve this by establishing an organization that would allow whistleblowers
from all countries to pass on their information, confident that their
identities would not be able to be discovered. He proposed that his
organization would then publish the information for the purpose of
collective analysis so as to empower oppressed populations across the globe.
There are few original ideas in politics. In the creation of WikiLeaks,
Julian Assange was responsible for one.
In late 2006 Assange sought a romantic partner through OKCupid in the name
of Harry Harrison.
Under the heading, "What am I doing with my life?", he
answered:
"directing a consuming, dangerous human rights project which is,
as you might expect, male-dominated".
Under the heading,
"I spend a lot of
time thinking about", he answered: "Changing the world through passion,
inspiration and trickery".
There was something distinctly Walter Mittyish
about it all.
Under the informal leadership of Julian Assange, a group of
mainly young men, without resources and linked only by computers, now began
to implement their plans for a peaceful global political revolution.
On 4 October Assange registered the domain name "WikiLeaks.org" in the US.
He called it WikiLeaks because he had been immensely impressed by the
success of the Wikipedia experiment, where 3 million entries had been
contributed through the input of a worldwide virtual community.
As he put
it, WikiLeaks would be to leaks what Wikipedia was to the encyclopedia.
Strangely and perhaps revealingly, it was registered under the names of two
fathers, his biological one, John Shipton, and his cypherpunk political one,
John Young, a New York architect who ran the intelligence leak
website Cryptome, which could be seen as WikiLeaks' predecessor.
Assange explained
his request for assistance to Young like this:
You knew me under another name from cypherpunks days. I am involved in a
project that you may have a feeling for... The project is a mass document
leaking project that requires someone with backbone to hold the .org domain
registration...
We expect the domain to come under the usual political and
legal pressure. The policy for .org requires that registrants names not be
false or misleading. It would be an easy play to cancel the domain unless
someone were willing to stand up and claim to be the registrant.
The choice of Young reveals something about Assange.
For Young was
undoubtedly the most militant security cypherpunk of all, who had published
on his website an aerial photo of Dick Cheney's hideout bunker, a photograph
of the home of Fox News's Bill O'Reilly, and the names of 276 British and
some 600 Japanese intelligence agents and 2619 CIA "sources". Young was also
Jim Bell's greatest champion. After Bell's arrest and imprisonment, Young
nominated him for the Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design.
Bell had, he
argued in his nomination, contributed,
"an imaginative and sophisticated
prospective for improving governmental accountability by way of a scheme for
anonymous, untraceable political assassination".
A potential WikiLeaks logo in development, 2006, as published by Cryptome.
(c) Wikileaks
Serious work on the establishment of WikiLeaks began in December 2006.
One
of the first tasks was to decide upon a logo. Before opting for the
hourglass, the WikiLeaks team thought seriously about a mole breaking
through a wall above which stood three sinister authoritarian figures, arms
folded. Another early task was to put together an advisory board. The first
person he wanted was
Daniel Ellsberg.
Assange explained the purpose of
WikiLeaks and why he had been approached:
We'd like your advice and we'd like you to form part of our political armor.
The more armor we have, particularly in the form of men and women sanctified
by age, history and class, the more we can act like brazen young men and get
away with it.
Here was one generation speaking to another.
A month after being contacted
Ellsberg replied.
"Your concept is terrific and I wish you the best of luck
with it."
He did not agree to join the board.
Two leading cypherpunks were
approached - the British computer security specialist Ben Laurie and one of
the cypherpunks founders, John Gilmore. Laurie became actively involved.
Gilmore instead asked the
Electronic Frontier Foundation he had also
co-founded to help. Assange's old cypherpunk sparring partner, Danny
O'Brien, now with the EFF, offered to assist.
Also approached not long after
were two Chinese Tiananmen Square dissidents, a member of the Tibetan
Association in Washington and Australian journalist Phillip Adams. All
agreed to join the board of advisers and, then, most seem never to have
heard from WikiLeaks again.
What do the early internal documents reveal about the charge that WikiLeaks
was an anti-American outfit posing as a freedom of information organization?
In his invitation to Gilmore, Assange had pledged that WikiLeaks,
"will
provide a catalyst that will bring down government through stealth
everywhere, not least that of the Bushists".
In its first public statement, WikiLeaks argued that,
"misleading leaks and misinformation are already well
placed in the
mainstream media... an obvious example being the lead-up to
the Iraq war".
And in an email of 2 January 2007 Assange even argued that WikiLeaks could
advance by several years,
"the total annihilation of the current US regime
and any other regime that holds its authority through mendacity alone".
And
yet, despite these statements, the evidence surrounding WikiLeaks'
foundation makes it abundantly clear that anti-Americanism was not the
primary driving force.
Time and again, in its internal documents, it argued
that its,
"roots are in dissident communities" and that its "primary targets
are those highly oppressive regimes in China, Russia and central Eurasia".
China is a special focus.
One or more of WikiLeaks' inner coterie were
Taiwanese hacking into Chinese government sources. At the time of its
foundation, WikiLeaks claimed to have more than a million documents. Almost
certainly almost all came from China.
For this reason, WikiLeaks argued
publicly that,
"a politically motivated legal attack on us would be seen as a
grave error in western administrations".
Concerning its targets, the
formulation is precise.
WikiLeaks has in its sights authoritarian
governments, the increasingly authoritarian tendencies seen in the recent
trajectory of the western democracies, and the authoritarian nature of
contemporary business corporations.
What then of the charge that WikiLeaks was a revolutionary organization
pretending to be concerned merely with reformist liberal issues such as
exposure of corruption, open government and freedom of information and
expression? The internal WikiLeaks documents show that the answer to this
question is complex.
At its foundation, Assange frequently argued that
WikiLeaks' true nature did indeed need to be disguised.
Because,
"freedom of
information is a respected liberal value", Assange argued, "we may get some
sympathy" but it would not last.
Inevitably governments would try to crush WikiLeaks. But if the mask of moderation was maintained, at least for some
time, opposition would be "limp wristed".
A quotation from the Book of
Isaiah, he believed, might be suitable,
"if we were to front as a
Ploughshares [peace] organization".
To John Young he wrote:
"We have the
collective sources, personalities and learning to be, or rather appear to
be, the reclusive
übermensch of the 4th estate".
The emphases are mine.
He
also knew that if WikiLeaks was to prosper, and also to win support from
philanthropic bodies such as the
Soros Foundation, the hacker-cypherpunk
origin of the inner circle needed to be disguised.
"We expect difficult
state lashback [sic] unless WikiLeaks can be given a sanctified frame
('centre for human rights, democracy, good government and apple pie press
freedom project' vs. 'hackers strike again')."
The key to WikiLeaks was that
its true revolutionary ambitions and its moderate liberal public face would
be difficult for opponents to disentangle.
Open government and freedom of
information were standard liberal values. However, as explained in the
theory outlined in "Conspiracy as Governance", they were the values in whose
name authoritarian structures would be undermined world-wide, through the
drying up of information flows and a paralyzing fear of insider leaks.
It was not only opponents who found it difficult to keep the public and
private faces of WikiLeaks distinct.
Despite those involved understanding
the need for disguise, at its foundation the excitement was so palpable and
the ambition so boundless that, when it was called upon to explain itself,
the mask of apple pie liberal reformist moderation instantly fell away.
On 3
January 2007 a small crisis arose when WikiLeaks' existence was prematurely
revealed.
Assange immediately put together a brilliant description of
WikiLeaks for public release.
Principled leaking has changed the course of human history for the better;
it can alter the course of history in the present, it can lead to a better
future... Public scrutiny of otherwise unaccountable and secretive
institutions pressures them to act ethically. What official will chance a
secret corrupt transaction when the public is likely to find out?...
When
the risks of embarrassment through openness and honesty increase, the tables
are turned against conspiracy, corruption, exploitation and oppression...
Instead of a couple of academic specialists, WL will provide a forum for the
entire global community to examine any document relentlessly for
credibility, plausibility, veracity and falsifiability...
WL may become the
most powerful intelligence agency on earth, an intelligence agency of the
people m WL will be an anvil at which beats the hammer of the collective
conscience of humanity... WL, we hope, will be a new star in the political
firmament of humanity.
Julian Assange recognized that the language of what amounted to the
WikiLeaks Manifesto might appear a little "overblown". He
recognized that it
had about it too much the flavor of "anarchy".
But in general when it was
written he was pleased.
John Young was not.
In early January 2007 he decided that WikiLeaks was a
CIA-backed fraud.
"Fuck your cute hustle and disinformation campaign. Same
old shit, working for the enemy... Fuck 'em all."
"We are going to fuck
them all. Chinese mostly but not entirely a feint," Assange cryptically
replied.
Young decided now to post all the WikiLeaks correspondence between
early December 2006 and early January 2007 on his website.
Later, in 2010,
he published Assange's contributions to the cypherpunks list between 1995
and 2002. It is because of his baseless suspicion that the mind of Julian
Assange and the intellectual origins of WikiLeaks are able to be understood.
In February 2007, Julian Assange travelled to Nairobi to attend the World
Social Forum, a very large gathering of mainly left-wing human rights
activists and NGOs.
He stayed on in Kenya for several months, involved with
anti-corruption forces but also fascinated and repelled by the world of
superstition he encountered:
Here, in Africa there was a two page fold out on the 'Night Runner' plague.
Plague?
Yes, Of people - typically old, who supposedly run around naked at
night... tapping on windows, throwing rocks on peoples [sic] roofs,
snapping twigs, rustling grass, casting spells and getting lynched because
it's the' right thing to do' .
Insofar as we can affect the world. let it be to utterly eliminate guilt and
fear as a motivator of man and replace it cell for cell with love of one
another and the passion of creation.
Assange was a true Enlightenment Man.
The next Social Forum was to be held between 27 June and 4 July in Atlanta.
Assange wanted WikiLeaks volunteers to attend. Emails he sent in early June
can be found on the internet. They provide the clearest evidence of his
political viewpoint and strategic thinking at this time.
In the first he
assures his supporters that WikiLeaks' future is secure.
"[T]he idea can't
be stopped. It's everyone's now."
Some people have apparently argued that WikiLeaks' idealism or "childlike naivety" is a weakness.
He believes they
are entirely wrong.
"Naivety is unfailingly attractive when it adorns
strength. People rush forward to defend and fight for individuals and
organizations imbued with this quality."
Confronted by it, "virtuous
sophisticates" are "marooned".
Some people are clearly worried that WikiLeaks will be captured by "the Left". Assange assures his followers they
need not be concerned. In the US the problem is rather that WikiLeaks is
seen as too close to the CIA and American foreign policy. In fact, "we'll
take our torch to all."
Some people have dearly expressed doubts about
Social Forum types. Assange more than shares them.
They are by and large
"ineffectual pansies" who,
"specialize in making movies about themselves and
throwing 'dialogue' parties... with foundation money", while
fantasizing
that, "the vast array of functional cogs in brute inhumanity... would follow
their lead, clapping, singing and videotaping their way up Mt. Mostly
Harmless".
In Africa Assange has seen human rights fighters of real
backbone.
He warns his followers not to expect to find such people in the
US. He quotes at length from Solzhenitsyn's 1979 Harvard address about the
radical decline of "civic courage" in the West especially among the "ruling
and intellectual elites". Nonetheless, to advance WikiLeaks' cause, the
Social Forum - the world's biggest NGO "beach party" - matters. Assange
anticipates that anti-Iraq War feeling will hold it together.
Although WikiLeaks has so far concentrated on "the most closed governments", he
explains that it is about to publish explosive material on American
"involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan".
He hopes that the anti-war movement
will embrace these documents so that WikiLeaks can avoid the "retributive"
blast from pro-war forces. It is vital to position itself "as everyone's
friend". If anyone still needs it, this dispatch is proof that Assange has a
biting tongue, a mordant wit and a brilliant political mind.
It is obvious that by June 2007 several members of the Left had indeed
gravitated to WikiLeaks. In Assange's view, this group were thinking of
publishing commentary on leaked documents in a way that allowed their
political bias to show.
He sent a different email to them:
OK, you guys need to keep the Progressive Commie Socialist agendas and
rhetoric to yourselves or you're going to go nowhere very, very fast. Now,
now, don't get your dander up: if I can pass by gross mis-characterizations
of the existing world order as 'capitalism' or 'white supremacy' I you can
stay calm and listen a minute.
WikiLeaks was in danger, he argued, of being positioned either as a CIA
front by John Young types or as a same-old left-wing outfit "preaching to
the choir".
All partisanship would be lethal. WikiLeaks needed to keep
itself open to whistleblowers of all stripes - even,
"conservative and
religious types waking up to the fact that they've been taken for a ride".
"What you need to strive for is the same level of objectivity and analytical
disinterest as the League of Women Voters. No, even higher. Else I'll be so
disheartened that I'll lower myself to government contracting work."
This
email is not only illuminating from the point of view of WikiLeaks' grand
strategy. It is also decisive as to his true political position.
Assange
might have been on the left of the spectrum by anarcho-capitalist cypherpunk
standards but he was by no means a standard leftist. His politics were
anti-establishment but genuinely beyond Left and Right.
Between 2007 and 2010 Assange's political thinking was shaped by two key
ideas. The first, as we have seen, was that all authoritarian structures -
both governments and corporations - were vulnerable to insider leaks. Fear
would throttle information/lows. Assange called this a "secrecy tax".
Inevitably, he argued, because of this tax, governments and corporations
with nothing to hide would triumph over their secretive, unjust
conspiratorial competitors.
This aspect of his politics amounted to a kind
of political Darwinism, a belief not in the survival of the fittest but of
the most transparent and most just. As an organization that encouraged
whistleblowers and published their documents, WikiLeaks was aiding and
speeding up this process.
There was, however, another dimension of his politics that reflected his
long association with the cypherpunks. Assange believed that, in the era of
globalization, laws determining communication were going to be harmonized.
The world would either opt for a closed system akin to Chinese political
secrecy and American intellectual property laws, or an open system found to
some extent in Belgium and Sweden. Once more, Assange hoped that WikiLeaks
was assisting a positive outcome to this struggle through its role as what
he called a global publisher of last resort.
If WikiLeaks could survive the
attacks certain to be mounted by governments and corporations, the rights of
human beings to communicate freely with each other without the intervention
of governments would be entrenched. WikiLeaks was, according to this
argument, the canary in the mine. Assange was taken with the famous Orwell
quote. He who controls the present controls the past and he who controls the
past controls the future.
The world was at a turning point. Either
Big
Brother would take
control of the internet or an era of unprecedented
freedom of communication would arrive.
Assange was by now in the habit of composing motivational emails for his
volunteers.
This is the message he sent them on 12 March 2008:
Mankind has successfully adapted changes as monumental as electricity and
the engine. It can also adapt to a world where state sponsored violence
against the communications of consenting adults is not only unlawful, but
physically impossible.
As knowledge flows across nations it is time to sum
the great freedoms of every nation and not subtract them. It is time for the
world as an international collective of communicating peoples to arise and
say 'here I am'.
This might have come straight out of a cypherpunks manifesto.
In the first
weeks of 2010 Assange was involved in an ultimately successful political
maneuver to turn Iceland into the world's first "data haven" with the most
politically progressive anti-censorship laws on Earth. According to
Domscheit-Berg, Assange's idea of a data haven came straight from the
canonical cypherpunk novel by Neal Stephenson,
Cryptonomicon, which ranked
with Solzhenitsyn's The First Circle as Assange's favorite.
There was an aspect of WikiLeaks' work that was, through 2008 and 2009,
beginning to trouble Assange.
Although it was a peripatetic organization
with only four permanent staff - Assange, Domscheit-Berg and two others
known as " the architect" and "the technician" - WikiLeaks had proven to be
an outstanding success in attracting leaks and then publishing them.
By late
2009 it had published documents concerning,
-
an Islamist assassination order
from Somali
-
massive corruption in Daniel arap Moi's Kenya
-
tax avoidance by
the largest Swiss bank, Julius Baer
-
an oil spill in Peru
-
a nuclear
accident in Iran
-
toxic chemical dumping by the Trafigura corporation off
the Ivory Coast
Further, it had released,
-
the Guantanamo Bay operational
manuals
-
secret film of dissent in Tibet
-
the emails of Sarah Palin
-
a
suppressed report into an assassination squad operating in Kenya
-
American
intelligence reports on the battle of Fallujah, and reports into the
conditions in its jails
-
the CIimategate emails
-
the internet censorship
lists from Australia
-
the loans book of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing
WikiLeaks had never been successfully sued, although
Julius Baer
had tried.
None of the identities of the whistleblowers who sought to
conceal them had been uncovered. WikiLeaks had won awards from the
Economist, in 2008, and from Amnesty International, in 2009. Assange
believed that WikiLeaks' information had determined a Kenyan election.
He
knew that the publication of the loans book in
Iceland had riveted the
nation, especially after Kaupthing had brought down an injunction against
the national broadcaster's evening television news. And yet, as his internal
communications make clear, he was puzzled and appalled by the world's
indifference to his leaks.
Assange had once regarded WikiLeaks as the people's intelligence agency.
In
January 2007 he sincerely believed that when WikiLeaks published commentary
on the Somalia assassination order document it would be,
"very closely
collaboratively analyzed by hundreds of Wikipedia editors" and by "thousands
of refugees from the Somali, Ethiopian and Chinese expat communities".
This
simply had not happened.
Commentary by the people on material produced by
their intelligence agency never would. He had once hoped for engaged
analysis from the blogosphere. What he now discovered were what he thought
of as indifferent narcissists repeating the views of the mainstream media on
"the issues de jour" with an additional flourish along the lines of "their
pussy cat predicted it all along".
Even the smaller newspapers were
hopeless. They relied on press releases, ignorant commentary and theft. They
never reported the vitally significant leaks without WikiLeaks intervention.
Counter-intuitively, only the major newspapers in the world, such as the New
York Times or the Guardian, undertook any serious analysis but even they
were self-censoring and their reportage dominated by the interests of
powerful lobby groups.
No one seemed truly interested in the vital material WikiLeaks offered or willing to do their Own work.
He wrote to his
volunteers:
What does it mean when only those facts about the world with economic powers
behind them can be heard, when the truth lays [sic] naked before the world
and no one will be the first to speak without a bribe?
WikiLeaks' unreported
material is only the most visible wave on an ocean of truth rotting in draws
[sic] of the fourth estate, waiting for a lobby to subsidize its revelation
into a profitable endeavor.
In Iraq, a junior American intelligence analyst, Private
Bradley Manning -
at least according to very convincing evidence yet to be tested in court -
had been following WikiLeaks' activities with interest.
On 25 November 2009 WikiLeaks released a document comprising 573,000 messages from September 11.
As this material could only come from a National Security Agency leak,
Manning was now convinced that WikiLeaks was genuine.
Eventually, after
sending WikiLeaks some cables concerning the American Ambassador in Iceland,
he decided to download 93,000 logs from the Afghan War, 400,000 incident
reports from the war in Iraq and 250,000 State Department cables, to which
he and hundreds of thousands of American officials had access, and to send
them to WikiLeaks.
As a cover, he brought along Lady Gaga CDs and, while
downloading these documents onto disc, pretended to be mouthing the words to
the music. Some time after, he confessed to a convicted hacker, Adrian Lamo,
what he had done. The most secure encryption and remailing systems were
powerless against human, all-too-human frailty.
Lamo in turn informed the
FBI and American military authorities. Shortly after, Manning was arrested
and taken to a military prison in West Virginia. Lamo also went with his
evidence to a longstanding acquaintance, another convicted hacker, Kevin Poulsen, who worked at the magazine Wired.
Poulsen published the log of some
of the conversation between Manning and Lamo.
(12.15:11 PM) bradass87 hypothetical question: if you had free reign [sic]
over classified networks for long periods of time... say 8-9 months... and
you saw incredible things, awful things... things that happened in the
public domain, and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington DC... what would you do?
(12.26:09 PM) bradass87 lets just say 'someone' I know intimately well, has
been penetrating US classified networks, mining data like the ones
described... and been transferring that data from the classified networks
Over the 'air gap' onto a commercial network computer... sorting the data,
compressing it, encrypting it, and uploading it to a crazy white haired
aussie who can't stay in one country very long.
One of the items sent to WikiLeaks was a video of a coldblooded, American
Apache helicopter attack on a group of Iraqis, in
which up to 15 men were gunned down. Assange made the decision to concentrate the resources and the
energies of WikiLeaks on publishing it under the title: "Collateral Murder".
In early April 2010, he flew to Washington to launch it, with his temporary
chief-of-staff in Iceland (where the video had been edited), Rop Gonggrijp,
the Dutch veteran of Berlin's
Chaos Computer Club. On 5 April, Assange
addressed the National Press Club.
His frustration with the indifference of
the world was, to put it mildly, about to end.
For once, the cliché is true. What happened over the next ten months is
stranger than fiction. With the release of the "Collateral Murder" footage, WikiLeaks became instantly famous. At the suggestion of a journalist at the
Guardian, Nick Davies, Assange decided to publish the new material he had
received from Manning anonymously in association with some of the world's
best newspapers or magazines.
Complex and heated negotiations between WikiLeaks and the Guardian, the New York Times and Der Spiegel were now
conducted. Even though these negotiations are one of the less interesting
aspects of this story, already three books from the news outlets involved
offering their own perspectives have been published.
Assange had long
regarded the western media as narcissistic. It is likely that his judgment
was now confirmed.
In July the first of the Manning tranche, the
Afghan War Diary, was
published. Assange held back only 15,000 of the 93,000 reports.
Unforgivably, those released included the names of perhaps 300 Afghans who
had assisted western forces. A Taliban spokesperson, Zabiullah Mujahid,
claimed that a nine-member commission had been created after the documents
were released "to find out about people who were spying".
Assange was
unrepentant. Both in private and in public, he argued that if they were
collaborators they deserved to die. Assange did, however, learn from the
experience.
When the
Iraq War logs were released in October most names had
been redacted.
By now, WikiLeaks was beginning to implode.
Relations between Assange and
Domseheit-Berg became increasingly tense, especially after Assange warned
him, in April 2010, rather alarmingly:
"If you fuck up, I'll hunt you down
and kill you."
Some insiders such as Birgitta Jonsdottir, the anarchist
Icelandic parliamentarian, were concerned about the cavalier way in which
Assange had handled the moral issue of the Afghan War Diary.
Many resented
what they saw as the increasingly dictatorial tendency inside WikiLeaks.
Assange told the Icelandic anarchist historian
Herbert Snorrason:
"I don't
like your tone. If it continues you're out. I am the heart and soul of this
organization, its founder, philosopher, spokesperson, original coder,
organizer, financier, and all of the rest. If you have a problem... piss
off."
On 21 August, Assange discovered that he was under investigation for sexual
crime after he slept with two Swedish supporters during a triumphal visit to
Stockholm, one of whom, Anna Ardin, to complicate matters, had
written advice on her blog concerning seven legal [correction]
kinds of revenge women might take after sexual mistreatment.
Facing these charges, Assange
expected total loyalty. Neither Domscheit-Berg nor Jonsdottir were willing
to give him what he wanted. Domscheit-Berg was suspended from WikiLeaks;
Jonsdottir quit.
The "architect" followed. He and Domscheit-Berg took the
WikiLeaks' submissions with them, at least temporarily, on the grounds that
its sources needed far more scrupulous protection. Yet there was more to the
implosion of WikiLeaks than concerns about Assange's laxity over security,
or his cavalier and dictatorial behavior.
In December, Rop Gonggrijp
confessed to the Chaos Computer Club:
"I guess I could make up all sorts of
stories about how I disagreed with people or decisions, but the truth is
that [during] the period that I helped out, the possible ramifications of WikiLeaks scared the bejezuz out of me. Courage is contagious, my ass."
Assange had taken on the power of the American state without flinching.
His
identification with Solzhenitsyn was no longer empty. Assange decided to
release the 250,000
U.S. Department of State cables WikiLeaks still had in its
possession on drip-feed so their content could be absorbed. On 28 November
the first batch was published.
The American vice-president, Joe Biden,
called Assange a "high-tech terrorist".
The rival vice-presidential
candidate of 2008, Sarah Palin, thought he should be hunted down like Osama
Bin Laden, a suggestion that led Assange to quip to Paris Match that at
least that option assured him of a further ten years of freedom. Visa,
Mastercard and Pay Pal severed connections with WikiLeaks. A global
guerrilla hacker army of WikiLeaks supporters, Anonymous, mounted an instant
counterattack.
Assange was by now facing two legal threats:
-
extradition to
Sweden to be interviewed about his relations with Anna Ardin and Sofia
Willen
-
or extradition to the US where a secret grand jury had been
established to look into whether he had committed crimes outlined in the
1917 Espionage Act or broken some other law
After a preliminary hearing in
London on the Swedish extradition request, he was first imprisoned in Wandsworth jail and then placed under a form of house arrest.
In early April 2010 hardly anyone had heard of Julian Assange. By December
he was one of the most famous people on Earth, with very powerful enemies
and very passionate friends. A future extradition to the US was almost
certain to ignite a vast Left vs. Right global cultural war, a kind of
21st-century equivalent of the
Dreyfus Affair.
Ironically, if that broke
out, his staunchest and most eloquent defenders were likely to be people
such as John Pilger or Tariq Ali, whom Assange privately had once derided as
followers of the "Progressive Commie Socialist" agenda, or the left-wing
American film-maker Michael Moore, whom, Domseheit-Berg tells us, Assange
considered "an idiot".
He would also be championed by millions of "average
shy intellectuals" across the western world who had watched on passively as
the political and business elites and their spin-masters in the US and
beyond plunged Iraq into bloody turmoil, brought chaos to the global
financial markets and resisted action over the civilizational crisis of
climate change.
Assange had long grasped the political significance of his compatriot,
Rupert Murdoch.
In "Conspiracy as
Governance" he had called the
disinformation the political and business elites fed the people to safeguard
their power and their interests the "Fox News Effect". As the pressure on Assange mounted, Murdoch was clearly on his mind.
In December, he spoke to Pilger in the New Statesman of an
"insurance file" on Murdoch and News Corp
his supporters would release if he came to harm and to Paris Match about
Murdoch's supposed "tax havens".
If a culture war was engaged over Assange's
extradition to the US it would involve, strangely enough, the clash of
cultural armies mobilized by the creators of Fox News and WikiLeaks, the two
most influential Australians of the era.
Correction:
A sends:
I admire the speed with which you put complete documents on your site.
Here's a correction for Dr. Manne's article.
He wrote:
"Anna Ardin... had written advice on her
blog concerning seven legal kinds of revenge women might take after
sexual mistreatment."
This is part of the misinformation campaign
concerning the Swedish cases.
Ardin translated, or published a translation
of, an eHow article on revenge that's legal. In other words, the article
talks about ways of taking revenge that are not against the law; the
article is not about how to use the legal system to take revenge.
Making a false allegation of rape would be
illegal. The article was published in January, long before she met
Assange. The article does mention a person who has cheated or dumped
someone, but this is used as an example, and it appears to be worded to
be gender-neutral in the first reference. The second reference is to
"he," which is proper English grammar. The article also says it's better
to forgive than take revenge, and not to take revenge disproportionate
to the offense.
Here's one of many sources on this:
