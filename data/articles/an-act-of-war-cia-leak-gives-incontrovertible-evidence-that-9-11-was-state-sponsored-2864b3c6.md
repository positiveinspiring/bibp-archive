If you have ever questioned the official
narrative for
the September 11 attacks then you have,
without a doubt, been dubbed a
conspiracy nut by the
establishment media and those who hang on
their every word.
Like the Warren Commission report on the JFK
assassination, the 9/11 Report assembled by a Congressional investigation is
unraveling and being revealed for what it really is - nothing more than a
cover story.
This is no longer a conspiracy theory
its
conspiracy fact.
After the 9/11 attacks, the public was told
al Qaeda acted alone, with no state sponsors.
But the
White House never let it see an entire section of Congress
investigative report on 9/11 dealing with "specific sources of
foreign support" for the 19 hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudi nationals.
It was kept
secret and remains so today.
President Bush inexplicably censored 28 full
pages of the 800-page report. Text isnt just blacked-out here and there
in this critical-yet-missing middle section.
The pages are completely blank,
except for dotted lines where an estimated 7,200 words once stood
A pair of lawmakers who recently read the
redacted portion say they are "absolutely shocked" at the level of
foreign state involvement in the attacks.
Some information already has leaked from the
classified section, which is based on both CIA and FBI documents, and it
points back to Saudi Arabia, a presumed ally.
The Saudis
deny any role in 9/11, but the CIA in one memo reportedly found
"incontrovertible evidence" that Saudi government officials - not just
wealthy Saudi hardliners, but high-level diplomats and intelligence
officers employed by the kingdom - helped the hijackers both financially
and logistically.
The
intelligence files cited in the report directly implicate the Saudi
embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles in the attacks,
making 9/11 not just an act of terrorism, but an act of war.
The
New York Post investigation reveals that
Saudi agents, officials and operatives in Virginia, Florida, California and
D.C. provided direct support by way funding or intelligence to those
involved in bringing down the towers.
Karl Denninger at the
Market Ticker succinctly argues that this
was, in fact, an act of war:
Its
obvious given what happened, the logistical and funding requirements
and where the hijackers came from along with inexplicable
actions immediately following the attacks - unless our government
explicitly let certain people flee.
Yet we went to war in
Iraq and Afghanistan while helping the
Saudis - the very people who attacked us.
And Obama, to this day, kisses the
Saudi King.
Over three
thousands Americans are dead - yet President Obama bows to Saudi King
Abdullah, whose government had direct ties to 9/11 hijackers:
It makes a very convincing case that the
Saudi Government was involved in an act
of war against the United States. Not simply terrorism -
remember, the Pentagon, a
military target, was one of the locations hit.
The other intended target for the plane that
went down in PA was the Capitol.
You awake yet America? You damn well should be.
Its about
damn time that the mainstream media started talking about this - youre
only a decade late. And no, people like myself who have been saying
this all along are not nuts.
Were right.
In addition to this startling, yet unsurprising,
revelation is even more evidence that those within the Saudi government knew
what was coming.
Somebody made a ton of money shorting airline
stocks by positioning themselves for stock prices to crash in the aftermath
of 9/11 and that may well have been the Chief of
Saudi Intelligence and other government officials.
Moreover, after all flights within the
continental United States were grounded there was one - just one - airplane
that was allowed to fly over U.S. soil to, you guessed it, Saudi Arabia.
On board that plane were - and this has been
confirmed by an official Freedom of Information
request - the members of Osama Bin Ladens extended family. And
these are but a few of the
hundreds of inconsistencies surrounding the September 11th, 2001
attacks.
As it turns out, the "conspiracy theorists" are
the ones who accurately detailed the series of events and those involved in
the attacks. The "official story" itself, it seems, is the "conspiracy
theory."
Theyve spent hundreds of billions of dollars on
securing the United States and preventing another act of terror on U.S.
soil.
Theyve turned their
massive surveillance infrastructure inwards
on the American people under the pretext of preserving our safety. Theyve
identified hundreds of thousands of Americans and
included them on watch lists that restrict
their travel or flag them as
potential threats to national security.
Yet the real threat, the one that has been
validated by scores of reports and investigations, is being redacted and
ignored by our government.
We know that there is more to 9/11 than the
official story.
It doesnt just involve the Saudis. Americas
air defense, for example, were seemingly
disarmed minutes before the attack
occurred. Moreover, intelligence agents from
Israel
were reportedly spotted in New York on the day of, arrested by
NYPD, and then released under suspicious circumstances.
All of this is highly suspect, especially that a
mainstream news source like the New York Post would start releasing
these details to the general public.
As with 9/11, most people couldnt make sense of
it or why. A decade on we have a better perspective because weve seen the
implementation of initiatives all across America as a result of what
happened that day.
Call it a conspiracy, call it whatever you like,
but look around.
If
they lied - yes, lied - about the assassination of a
President of the United States, or about Benghazi, or Fast and Furious, or
the benefits of new health care laws, then,
-
What else are they hiding from us?
-
How much do you trust your government?
-
How much do you trust the official
narrative peddled by the establishment?
-
How much do you trust that
the powers that be have our best
interests at heart?
