The "shutdown" of
the US government and the financial climax associated with a deadline date,
leading to a possible "debt default" of the federal government is a money
making undertaking for Wall Street.
A wave of
speculative activity is sweeping major markets.
The uncertainty
regarding the shutdown and "debt default" constitutes a golden opportunity
for "institutional speculators". Those who have reliable "inside
information" regarding the complex outcome of the legislative process are
slated to make billions of dollars in windfall gains.
Speculative Bonanza
Several
overlapping political and economic agendas are unfolding. In a previous
article, we examined
the debt default saga in relation to the eventual privatization of important
components of the federal State system.
While Wall
Street exerts a decisive influence on policy and
legislation pertaining to the government shutdown, these same major
financial institutions also control the movement of currency markets,
commodity and stock markets through large scale operations in derivative
trade.
Most of the key actors in the US Congress and
the Senate involved in the shutdown debate are controlled by powerful
corporate lobby groups acting directly or indirectly on behalf of Wall
Street. Major interests on Wall Street are not only in a position to
influence the results of the Congressional process, they also have "inside
information" or prior knowledge of the chronology and outcome of the
government shutdown impasse.
They are slated to make billions of dollars in
windfall profits in speculative activities which are "secure" assuming that
they are in a position to exert their influence on relevant policy outcomes.
It should be noted, however, that there are
important divisions both within the US Congress as well as within the
financial establishment. The latter are marked by the confrontation and
rivalry of major banking conglomerates.
These divisions will have an impact on
speculative movements and counter movements in the stock, money and
commodity markets. What we are dealing with is "financial warfare".
The
latter is by no means limited to,
-
Wall Street
-
Chinese
-
Russian
-
Japanese,
...financial institutions (among others) will also be involved in the
speculative endgame. Speculative movements based on inside
information, therefore, could potentially go in different directions.
What
market outcomes are being sought by rival banking institutions?
Having inside information on the actions of
major banking competitors is an important element in the waging of major
speculative operations.
Derivative Trade
The major instrument of "secure" speculative
activity for these financial actors is
derivative trade, with carefully
formulated bets in the stock markets, major commodities - including gold and
oil - as well as foreign exchange markets.
These major actors may know "where the market is
going" because they are in a position to influence policies and legislation
in the US Congress as well as manipulate market outcomes.
Moreover, Wall Street speculators also influence
the broader publics perception in the media, not to mention the actions of
financial brokers of competing or lesser financial institutions which do not
have foreknowledge or access to inside information.
These same financial actors are involved in the
spread of "financial disinformation", which often takes the form of media
reports which contribute to either misleading the public or building a
"consensus" among economists and financial analysts which will push markets
in a particular direction.
Pointing to an inevitable decline of the US
dollar, the media serves the interests of the institutional speculators in
camouflaging what might happen in an environment characterized by financial
manipulation and the interplay of speculative activity on a large scale.
Speculative trade routinely involves acts of
deception.
In recent weeks, the media has been flooded with "predictions" of
various catastrophic economic events focusing on the collapse of the dollar,
the development of a
new reserve currency by the BRICS countries, etc.
At a recent conference hosted by the powerful
Institute of International Finance (IIF), a Washington based think
tank organization which represents the worlds most powerful banks and
financial institutions:
"Three
of the worlds most powerful bankers
warned of terrible consequences if the United States defaults on its
debt, with Deutsche Bank chief executive Anshu Jain claiming
default would be
'utterly catastrophic.'
This would be a very
rapidly spreading, fatal disease
I have no recommendations for this
audience
about putting band
aids on a gaping wound," he said.
"JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie
Dimon and Baudouin Prot, chairman of BNP Paribas,
said a default would
have dramatic consequences on the value of U.S. debt and the dollar, and
likely would plunge the world into another recession." (
)
Dimon and
other top executives from major U.S. financial firms met with President
Barack Obama and with lawmakers last week to
urge them to deal with both issues.
On
Saturday, Dimon said banks are already spending "huge amounts" of money
preparing for the possibility of a default,
which he said would threaten the global recovery after the 2007-2009
financial crisis.
Dimon also defended JPMorgan against critics who
say the bank has become too big to manage.
It has come under scrutiny from
numerous regulators and on Friday reported its first quarterly loss since Dimon took over, due to more than $7 billion in legal expenses.

What these "authoritative" economic assessments
are intended to create is an aura of panic and economic uncertainty,
pointing to the possibility of a collapse of the US dollar.
What is portrayed by the Institute of
International Finance panelists (who are the leaders of the worlds largest
banking conglomerates) is tantamount to an Economics
101 analysis of market
adjustment, which casually excludes the known fact that markets are
manipulated with the use of sophisticated derivative trading instruments.
In a bitter irony, the IIF panelists are
themselves involved in routinely twisting market values through derivative
trade.
Capitalism in the 21st century is no longer
based largely on profits resulting from a real economy productive process,
windfall financial gains are acquired through large scale speculative
operations, without the occurrence of real economy activity, at the touch of
a mouse button.
The manipulation of markets is carried out on
the orders of major bank executives including the CEOs of,
-
JPMorgan Chase
-
Deutsche Bank
-
BNP Paribas
The "too big to fail banks" are portrayed, in
the words of JPMorgan Chases CEO
Jamie Dimons, as the "victims" of
the debt default crisis, when in fact they are the architects of economic
chaos as well as the unspoken recipients of billions of dollars of stolen
taxpayers money.
These corrupt mega banks are responsible
for creating the "gaping wound" referred to by Deutsche Banks
Anshu
Jain in relation to the US public debt crisis.
Collapse of the Dollar?
Upward and downward movements of the US dollar
in recent years have little do with normal market forces as claimed by the
tenets of neoclassical economics.
Both JP Morgan Chases CEO Jamie Dimon and
Deutsche Banks CEO Anshu Jains assertions provide a distorted
understanding of the functioning of the US dollar market. The speculators
want to convince us that the dollar will collapse as part of a normal market
mechanism, without acknowledging that the "too big to fail" banks have the
ability to trigger a decline in the US dollar which in a sense obviates the
functioning of the normal market.
Wall Street has indeed the ability to "short"
the greenback with a view to depressing its value.
It has also has the ability through derivative
trade of pushing the US dollar up. These up and down movements of the
greenback are, so to speak, the "cannon feed" of financial warfare. Push the
US dollar up and speculate on the upturn, push it down and speculate on the
downturn.
It is impossible to assess the future movement
of the US dollar by solely focusing on the interplay of "normal market"
forces in response to the US public debt crisis.
While an assessment based on "normal market"
forces indelibly points to structural weaknesses in the US dollar as a
reserve currency, it does not follow that a weakened US dollar will
necessarily decline in a
Forex market which is routinely subject to
speculative manipulation.
Moreover, it is worth noting that the national
currencies of several heavily indebted developing countries have increased
in value in relation to the US dollar, largely as a result of the
manipulation of the foreign exchange markets.
Why would the national currencies of countries
literally crippled by foreign debt go up against the US dollar?
The Institutional
Speculator
-
JPMorgan Chase
-
Goldman Sachs
-
Bank America
-
Citi-Group
-
Deutsche Bank,
...et al: the strategy of the institutional
speculators is to sit on their "inside information" and create uncertainty
through heavily biased news reports, which are in turn used by individual
stock brokers to advise their individual clients on "secure investments".
And that is how people across America have lost
their savings.
It should be emphasized that these major
financial actors not only control the media, they also control the debt
rating agencies such as Moodys and Standard and Poor.
According to the mainstay of neoclassical
economics, speculative trade reflects the "normal" movement of markets. An
absurd proposition.
Since the de facto repeal of the
Glass-Steagall
Act and the adoption of the
Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999,
market manipulation tends to completely overshadow the "laws of the market",
leading to a highly unstable multi-trillion dollar derivative debt, which
inevitably has a bearing on the current impasse on Capitol Hill.
This
understanding is now acknowledged by sectors of mainstream financial
analysis.
There is no such thing as "normal market
movements".
The outcome of the government shutdown on
financial markets cannot be narrowly predicted by applying conventional
macro-economic analysis, which excludes outright the role of market
manipulation and derivative trade.
The outcome of the government shutdown on major
markets does not hinge upon "normal market forces" and their impacts on
prices, interest rates and exchange rates. What has to be addressed is the
complex interplay of "normal market forces" with a gamut of sophisticated
instruments of market manipulation.
The latter consist of an interplay of large
scale speculative operations undertaken by the most powerful and corrupt
financial institutions, with the intent to distorting "normal" market
forces.
It is worth mentioning that immediately
following the adoption of the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999,
the US Congress adopted the Commodity Futures Modernization Act 2000
(CFMA) which essentially,
"exempted commodity futures trading from
regulatory oversight."
Four major Wall Street financial institutions
account for more than 90 percent of the so-called derivative exposure:
-
J.P. Morgan Chase
-
Citi-Group
-
Bank America
-
Goldman Sachs
These major banks exert a pervasive influence on
the conduct of monetary policy, including the debate within the US Congress
on the debt ceiling. They are also among the Worlds largest speculators.
What is the speculative endgame behind the
shutdown and debt default saga?
An aura of uncertainty prevails. People across
America are impoverished as a result of the curtailment of "entitlements",
mass protest and civil unrest could erupt. Homeland Security (DHS) is the process of
militarizing domestic law enforcement.
In a bitter irony, each and all of
these economic and social events including political statements and
decisions in the US Congress concerning the debt ceiling, the evaluations of
the rating agencies, etc. create opportunities for the speculator.
Major speculative operations - feeding on inside
information and deception - are likely take place routinely over the next
few months as the fiscal and debt default crisis unfolds.
What is diabolical in this process is that major
banking conglomerates will not hesitate to destabilize stock, commodity and
foreign exchange markets if it serves their interests, namely as a means to
appropriate speculative gains resulting from a situation of turmoil and
economic crisis, with no concern for the social plight of millions of
Americans.
One solution - which is unlikely to be adopted
unless there is a major power shift in American politics - would be to
cancel the derivative debt altogether and freeze all derivative transactions
on major markets.
This would certainly help to tame the speculative
onslaught.
The manipulation through derivative trade of the
markets for basic food staples is particularly pernicious because it
potentially creates hunger. It has a direct bearing on the livelihood of
millions of people.
As we recall,
"the price of food and other commodities
began rising precipitately [in 2006],
Millions were cast below the
poverty line and food riots erupted across the developing world, from
Haiti to Mozambique."
According to Indian economist Dr. Jayati
Ghosh:
"It is now quite widely acknowledged that
financial speculation was the major factor behind the sharp price rise of
many primary commodities , including agricultural items over the past year
[2011]
Even recent research from the World Bank (Bafis
and Haniotis 2010) recognizes the role played by the "financialisation of
commodities" in the price surges and declines, and notes that price
variability has overwhelmed price trends for important commodities."

The artificial hikes in the price of crude oil,
which are also the result of market manipulation, have a pervasive impact on
costs of production and transportation Worldwide, which in turn contribute
to spearheading thousands of small and medium sized enterprises into
bankruptcy.
Big Oil including BP as well Goldman Sachs exert
a pervasive impact on the oil and energy markets.

The end result of financial warfare is the
appropriation of money wealth through speculative trade including,
The speculative onslaught led by Wall Street is
not only impoverishing the American people, the entire World population is
affected.
