AMY GOODMAN: We continue with Goldman Sachs.
JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, while
Goldman Sachs agreed Thursday to pay
$550 million to resolve a civil fraud lawsuit filed by the SEC, Goldman
has not been held accountable for many of its other questionable
investment practices.
A new article in Harpers Magazine examines
the role Goldman played in the food crisis of 2008, when the ranks of
the worlds hungry increased by 250 million.
The article is titled "The Food Bubble: How
Wall Street Starved Millions and Got Away With It."
AMY GOODMAN: The author of the article, Frederick Kaufman, joins us now.
Hes a contributing editor at Harpers Magazine.
Well, explain. Were talking about Goldman Sachs today, this - they call
it a landmark settlement, but they made more after-hours in trading last
night than they will have to pay.
So lets look at Goldman Sachs and its
record overall.
FREDERICK KAUFMAN: Yeah, this is really - its really outrageous.
And on a certain level, this reform bill is
really a sham, because it does not cover, in any way, shape or form,
what Goldman Sachs - and really, lets be honest here, it wasnt just
Goldman; it was Goldman, and it was Bear, and it was AIG, and it was
Lehman, it was Deutsche, it was all across the board, JPMorgan Chase -
what these banks were able to do in commodity markets, really which
reached its peak from 2005 to 2008, in what is now known as the food
bubble.
And as Juan points out, this is
unconscionable what happened, in the sense that their speculation and
their restructuring of these commodity markets pushed 250 million new
people into food insecurity and starving, and brought the world total up
to over a billion people.
This is the most abysmal total in the
history of the world.
JUAN GONZALEZ: Now, what were these commodities markets like before the
Wall Street firms got involved? And you have a haunting picture,
especially of the Minneapolis Exchange, what it was before, what it was
like.
Could you talk about how things operated and
then what Goldman Sachs did precisely?
FREDERICK KAUFMAN: The wheat markets, in particular, in this country are
the outcome of a process of development of over 150 years. And that is
why, from about 1903 to 2003, the real price of wheat in this country
has gone down. And this was one of the great reasons for Americas great
twentieth century, the fact that we had cheap food, we had cheap bread.
And Goldman, in 1991, came up with a new
idea and a new product, which, as I said before, completely restructured
this market and completely threw it out of whack.
But before we go there, we just have to maybe review for a second a
little bit about how these markets worked and what kept that wheat price
stabilized. And Juan, you mentioned the
Minneapolis Grain Exchange, this kind
of obscure syndicate in the Midwest, which is where the price of this
particular kind of wheat, hard red spring wheat, which is the most
widely traded wheat in the world, and its the most widely exported
wheat from the American continent - we kind of set the world price on
this wheat. This is where it happens.
Whats the history of that price being
stabilized is you have, traditionally, in the wheat futures market, two
kinds of players: one of the farmers and the millers and the
warehousemen - right?
And this, of course, includes players like
Dominos Pizza and Sara Lee and General Mills, very large business,
capitalist stakes are in this wheat market, right? And they are called
bona fide hedgers, because theyre actually buying and selling real
wheat.
As the price fluctuates in the futures
markets, you also traditionally have speculators in this market, people
who dont want wheat, who wouldnt have any place to put it if they
bought it, but theyre making money off buy orders and sell orders, as
the price fluctuates each day, and hopefully theyre bringing in some
money for themselves every day. Thats the idea.
Now, the key here is that both the bona fide hedgers and the
speculators, every time they buy, theyre also selling, and every time
they sell, they eventually buy. So their positions are cleared off at
the end of the day, OK?
Goldman, we have to understand, and a lot of
these banks, are not interested in the particular structure of any of
these markets. I think its a lot of mistake people make when they think
about how these bankers are working. We think that theyre actually
interested in the markets. We think that theyre - no.
What theyre after are very large pools of
cash for themselves. Theyre after accumulating huge pools of money that
they can do with whatever they like on a day-to-day basis. Right? And
so, Goldman, in 1991, came up with this idea of the commodity index
fund, which really was a way for them to accumulate huge piles of
cash for themselves. It wasnt really about the markets, anyway.
The market was just an excuse. And so, the
fact that they threw these wheat markets out of whack didnt really
matter to them.
How did this work? Instead of a buy-and-sell order, like everybody does
in these markets, they just started buying. Its called "going long."
They started going long on wheat futures. OK? And every time one of
these contracts came due, they would do something called "rolling it
over" into the next contract.
So they would take all those buy promises
they had made and say,
"OK, we still - were just going to -
well buy more later. And plus were going to buy more now."
And they kept on buying and buying and
buying and buying and accumulating this unprecedented, this historically
unprecedented pile of long-only wheat futures.
And this accumulation created a very odd
phenomenon in the market. Its called a "demand shock." Usually prices
go up because supply is low, right? Thats the idea. Theres not a lot
of supply, so the price goes up. In this case, Goldman and the other
banks had introduced this completely unnatural and artificial demand to
buy wheat, and that then set the price up.
Now, a lot of people are saying,
"Oh, it was biofuel production. It was
drought in Australia. It was floods in Kazakhstan."
Let me tell you, hard red wheat generally
trades between $3 and $6 per sixty-pound bushel. It went up to $12, then
$15, then $18. Then it broke $20. And on February 25th, 2008,
hard red spring futures settled at $25 per bushel.
This is completely beyond the pale,
particularly at a -
JUAN GONZALEZ: Almost ten times its historic price.
FREDERICK KAUFMAN: Yeah. It was just completely out of control. And, of
course, the irony here is that in 2008, it was the greatest
wheat-producing year in world history. The world produced more wheat in
2008 than ever before.
And heres the other outrage of it, which is that at the time that
Goldman and these other banks are completely messing up the structure of
this market, theyve protected themselves outside the market, through
this really almost diabolical idea called "replication," which is what I
discovered when I was looking into how they had structured this.
What they do - lets say, Juan, you want me
to invest for you in the wheat market. You give me a hundred bucks, OK?
Well, what I should be doing is putting a hundred bucks in the wheat
markets. But I dont have to do that. All I have to do is put $5 in.
Good-faith promise. And with that $5, I can hold your hundred-dollar
position. Well, now I got ninety-five of your dollars. What am I going
to do with them?
Well, what Goldman did with hundreds of
billions of dollars, and what all these banks did with hundreds of
billions of dollars, is they put them in the most conservative - no
fools, they - they put them in the most conservative investments
conceivable. They put it in
T-bills.
And then what did they do?
Well, now that you have hundreds of billions
of dollars in T-bills, you can leverage that into trillions of dollars.
This is what Im talking about, large pools of cash for themselves.
And then they take that trillion dollars,
they give it to their day traders, and they say,
"Go at it, guys. Do whatever is most
lucrative today."
And so, as billions of people starve, they
use that money to make billions of dollars for themselves.
JUAN GONZALEZ: And the result was, as the price went up, that there were
food riots around the world.
FREDERICK KAUFMAN: Yeah.
JUAN GONZALEZ: And what about the human dislocation that occurred?
FREDERICK KAUFMAN: Yeah, in 2008, there were food riots in more than
thirty countries. The global price of food rose over 80 percent. This
had an effect not only on wheat, but on corn, on soy, on cooking oil, on
rice.
You know, people talk about globalization.
"We dont need to set prices or have
tariffs, because were globalized. You know, people can buy their
wheat, anyway."
Well, gee, guess what happened.
When the price of wheat started to go
through the roof, something new, which was something old, came up,
called "nationalism," and people said,
"OK, sorry, were closing our wheat, and
were setting up tariffs."
And you had - you had riots. You had hunger.
You had a disaster. You had a global disaster, because, remember, in
America, were spending maybe 15 percent of our weekly paycheck on food,
right?
I mean, maybe you remember, a couple years
ago, why was that dozen eggs so expensive? Why was that milk so
expensive? Why was that meat so expensive? Thats 15 percent.
For most people on the earth, theyre
spending more than 50 percent of their daily income on their daily
bread. And when their daily bread moves up 80 percent, theyve just
moved right into the ranks of the food insecure. And it was not only in
Burkina Faso. This was in America. You had 49 million hungry families in
America.
You had one out of five children in America
at soup kitchens. You had a million hungry people in Los Angeles.
So, I mean, it is unconscionable that Wall Street has completely lost
touch with the reality. Theyve forgotten that there is their
mathematical formula, theres virtuality, on the one hand - "Gee, I can
make a lot of money by making a formula" - and on the other hand,
theres reality.
There are real things that they are
affecting, and theyve completely forgotten about it, to devastating
effect.
AMY GOODMAN: What do you think needs to be done?
FREDERICK KAUFMAN: Well, the solution is interesting, and it certainly
is not going to be solved by the financial reform bill weve just seen,
because, of course, the people I talk to at the Minneapolis Grain
Exchange and all over, theyre already prepared for every single trade
being exchange-traded.
The people at the Minneapolis Grain Exchange
have already prepared 50,000 exchange-traded slots for anything that
people want to trade.
Now, when I was talking to the hedge fund
guys and the traders and all my contacts on this, and I said, you know,
"What if Wall Street - Im sorry, what
if the federal government regulates you?" they just laugh.
They literally laugh. They scoff at federal
regulators, because theyre like,
"By the time they get around, they
figure out what were doing, were so far beyond it."
And in fact, the commodity index funds, the
long-only commodity index funds that I looked at now, theyre already
dinosaurs.
Theyre onto second-, third- and
fourth-generation reiterations of this. Theres no way the federal
government is going to be on top of them, because theyre so far ahead.
So, whats the other possibility? The other possibility is simply outlaw
it, say, if youre a bank, youre not allowed a stake, youre not
allowed a stake in actual commodity markets.
And I said to these guys, you know,
"What if they just outlaw you?"
And once again, rather unsurprisingly, their
reaction is outright laughter, because it takes them about ten seconds
to get over that problem.
Either they make a phone call to London and
do all their trading out of the London Exchange, or they do an
over-the-counter swap with a Cargill or a Nestlé or a bona fide hedger,
and its taken care of.
So whats the solution? I think the best solution thats been floated
around in Washington in the groups Ive been close to is an actual
international or national grain reserve.
I mean, we actually in this country, before
this kind of mania of deregulation, had a farmer-owned grain reserve
under the Clinton administration, real grain held back, so that
in times of a bubble like this, regulators can say,
"Look, you know, we have plenty of real
wheat. Heres a hundred million bushels of wheat. We can bring it to
the market. We can bring that price back into a stable band."
And this is, I think, in some ways, the best
solution: real wheat to counter virtual madness.
JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, yet, as you were saying, that the Wall Street firms
are always able to devise new ways to get around regulation.
I was reading in todays paper on the new
bill, the financial regulation bill, that the banks have already devised
new methods. For instance, that they are no longer able to charge such
exorbitant interest rates on credit cards, so now theyre going to begin
imposing fees on checking accounts.
And they just come up with an immediate new
solution to keep making huge amounts of money and getting around the
regulators.
So, even with this reserve situation that
you raise about creating grain reserve, are there potentials for the
Wall Street firms to figure out a new way to continue to control and
make money off the food supply?
FREDERICK KAUFMAN: Well, I think the theory behind what youre saying,
Juan, is called "market capture," in the sense that whenever you have a
group of people, be they in the auto business or in the healthcare
business, whenever they fear regulation from the government, this group
is, of course, the most at-risk group.
They are the ones who put more of their
resources into understanding this regulation than anybody else, more of
their lobbyists, more of their money into understanding whats going on,
and therefore, theyre the ones who ultimately - the people whose
interest it touches most intrinsically are the ones who then capture
that reform, market capture.
So what I like about the grain reserve is
that its actually outside of the purview, outside of the financial
purview. As I said before, its no longer in the realm of the virtual;
its no longer in the realm of the numbers. Its actual real wheat, and
you can actually bring it to bear. You can bring it to markets.
There was a complete madness for hard red
spring wheat in 2008, when you had international orders coming in from
Nigeria, from all over the world, and there literally was the perception
that there was no wheat out there. And so this thing, as you say, goes
up and up and up and up and up. If there is actually somebody who can
say, who can bring real wheat and calm these markets, youre going to
save lives.
Its not just that youre going to save
mortgages or that youre going to save, you know, finances; it is that,
literally, you no longer have those outrageous numbers of starving
people on earth, most of them women and children.
AMY GOODMAN: Were going to leave it there.
I want to thank you very much for being with
us. "The
