The Chinese people
would revolt against
overt foreign domination,
but embrace their place in the NWO
if they believed they were in control.
Beijing
The Chinese elite is a merger between,
-
the
Communist leadership
-
Hong Kong tycoons
-
the criminal Triads
All three
factions derive derive their power from Illuminati collaboration.
China has appeared autonomous because the Illuminati developed the country
internally, funding 'revolutionary' political parties spouting nationalist
slogans. The reasoning was that the Chinese people would revolt against
overt foreign domination, but embrace their place in
the NWO if they
believed they were in control.
Lord Bertrand Russell
revealed this plan in a report on China published in 1920:
'Out of the renaissance spirit now existing in China, it is possible, if
foreign nations can be prevented from wreaking havoc, to develop a new
civilization better than any that the world has yet known.'
The fascist superpower we know today was created in the second half of the
20th century by the bogus Cold War dialectic of communism vs. capitalism.
The stage was set in 1898 when Britain and China signed a contract
stipulating that Hong Kong would be handed back to the Chinese in 1997. This
meant that the fierce Communism of the mainland and laissez faire
capitalism of Hong Kong were always destined to merge.
The process of unification gave rise to the current China power elite. What
follows is background of the three main factions.
THE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP
Because Communism is an
Illuminati creation, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
are by definition, Illuminati agents.
Mao was a Soviet agent. (Mao-The Untold Story, Chang & Halliday,
p.49.)
He was a
product
of the Yale in China "Missionary" i.e. OSS,
Skull & Bones program.
The CCP implemented policies that set the foundations for an Illuminati
super state. They unified the country, attacked traditional Chinese culture,
instigated industrialization programs and created a common language.
Wang Hao, a historian at the China Institute of International Studies,
has recorded
that Mao's deputy Zhou Enlai met
David Rockefeller in June 1973:
'When meeting David Rockefeller, Zhou said to him that it was necessary to
find appropriate methods conducive to the development of the trade between
two sides under different political systems.'
The corporate-communist merger began when Deng Xiaoping came to power in the
late 1970s and introduced his market reforms with the slogan,
"to get rich is
glorious."
However, after 30 years of Maoism his regime was hopelessly ill equipped to
run a market economy.
They turned to the wealthiest Chinese tycoons in Hong
Kong for guidance.
THE HONG KONG TYCOONS
The most powerful HK tycoon is
Li Ka-Shing, the richest Asian in the
world and an Illuminati insider.
Other prominent tycoons are,
-
'HK's godfather of real estate' Henry Fok
-
'The
king of gambling' Stanley Ho
-
the man who would be chosen by Beijing to
head Hong Kong after the departure of the British, Tung Chee-Wa
It is important to realize that these men rose to power and prestige in a
British colony, i.e. they were vetted by the City of London to be colonial
leaders.
This is illustrated by the rise of Li Ka Shing.
As HK developed, Li emerged as the most brilliant Chinese entrepreneur. The
'Brotherhood bankers' of Hong Kong became aware of his mercantile genius and
brought him into the fold.
In 1979 Li took control of Hutchinson Whampoa, one of the old British
companies that had long dominated Hong Kong's economy. Companies of such
political importance are not given away casually. In 2000, the Queen
awarded Li the
title of 'Knight (Commander of the Order) of the British Empire.'
In the early eighties, the tycoons and the communists had a series of
meetings in Beijing. They struck a deal whereby the tycoons advised and
educated the Chinese authorities about markets and in return Beijing gave
them privileged access to their vast economic basin.
In 1984 the two groups founded
CITIC, the
organization that managed China's transition to market economy.
THE TRIADS
The Triads is a collective term for the secret societies and criminal groups
that originated in 18th century China with the aim to bring down
the Qing
dynasty.
For over a century the Illuminati waged war against the Qing dynasty. The
Triads were their vehicle for subversion and revolution, in a similar
fashion to Freemasonry in Western revolutions.
For instance, during
the opium wars, the Triads helped bring the drug into
China.
The revolutionary Nationalist Government that toppled the Qing
dynasty in 1912 was a coalition of triad groups. Sun Yat-sen, the man who
led the nationalist coalition that toppled the Qing in 1912,
was a Triad
member and was trained and armed in British Hong Kong. Chiang Kai-shek
was also a Triad member.
When the Communists achieved dominance in 1949 they kicked the Triads out of
the country. They fled mainly to Hong Kong and Taiwan to re-build. Chiang
Kai-shek continued to publicly receive US funding.
Today the Triads are best known as the world's largest criminal entity,
involved in drug trafficking, prostitution, money laundering etc.
They exist
in any country with a large Chinese population, notably in,
-
Canada
-
Britain
-
USA
-
Australia
Former Canadian diplomat
Brian McAdam
said:
"Within each Chinese community, there's usually a strong Triad
presence controlling and extorting money from the businesses, and if there's
drugs, they're bringing them in."
Of the Triads enormous global reach
Fritz Springmeier has
written:
'The Triads are the most powerful criminal fraternal group in the world,
except for the Illuminati and the families that make up the Illuminati's
Committee of 300. The Mafia Is small peanuts compared to the Triads.
The
Triads are almost untouchable by any law enforcement group. For instance, in
Great Britain the British do not have hardly any ethnic Chinese on their
police force to even try infiltrating the Triads.'
A key source of this power is that they partner the Far East Lodges of
Freemasonry in running the Asian drugs trade, notably the production of
heroin
in the 'golden triangle' in South East Asia, second only to Afghanistan.
Drug trafficking is very important to the Illuminati because it funds black
budget programs.
The most powerful Triads in Hong Kong have their own territories,
headquarters, sub-societies and public fronts. They are allied with the
tycoons. The tycoon's own Hong Kong and the triads run it.
A few of these
are,
To insure a smooth handover of Hong Kong
in 1997, the communist leadership needed these groups onside.
In the early 80s, the
Chinese government convened a secret meeting between the 'Dragon Heads'
of the major Triad groups operational in Hong Kong. The communists informed
the dragons that if they agreed not to interfere with the takeover
transition, they would be allowed to continue their criminal activities
without interference.
Following these successful negotiations, Deng Xiaoping spoke of the triads
as Chinese "patriotic groups" and the Hong Kong press published a photograph
of Charles Heung, a senior officer of Sun Yee On, conversing with Deng's
daughter.
In 1992, Western Intelligence Services became aware Wong Man Fong - formerly
head of China's central news agency - was helping the triads to set up
legitimate businesses in China, particularly in Guangzhou and Shanghai.
CONCLUSION
The
mainstream media portrays China as hostile to Western power. However, by
studying the triumvirate Chinese elite and their intimate ties to
the
Illuminati, it is clear that modern China is an Illuminati creation.
The Chinese elite must never stray from the NWO agenda, for it follows that
if the Illuminati made them, they can break them too.
Part II
Illuminati Use China to Loot the West
by our Beijing Correspondent
March 8, 2012
In return for campaign
contributions,
Clinton transferred
secret military technology to China.
The incredible scale of Chinese subversion in Western countries has gone
virtually unreported.
It is most starkly revealed by a joint report on Chinese subversion between
the Canadian intelligence services and police force published in 1996. Since
the publication of this report, no steps have been taken to combat the
subversion, a clear sign that it is Illuminati sanctioned.
The report deals solely with activity in Canada but applies to all Western
countries.
The report identifies the China power block to be a merger
between the communists, Hong Kong tycoons and the triads. Their leader
appears to be Hong Kong billionaire Sir Li Ka Shing.
By 1996, the cabal had reached a,
'position in the Canadian economy that
allows them to engage in intelligence activities, such as technology
transfer, foreign influence and interference, identification and cultivation
of persons favorable to China, and the acquisition of undue control in
important Canadian economic and political circles.'
The process is simple.
The cabal,
'first buy a Canadian company so as to
obtain "local identity", legally concealing their foreign identity. Then,
the "Canadian" company invests heavily or buys other companies in various
economic sectors.
'In fact, control lies in Hong Kong or Beijing, and the financial benefits
or fruits of research, often paid for by Ottawa or the provinces, are likely
to make their way to Asia.'
The businesses owned by the triads are,
'used to pursue criminal activities,
such as money-laundering and heroin trafficking, as well as assisting the ChIS (Chinese Intelligence Services).'
The report estimated that a staggering 200 Canadian companies - this was in
1996 - are under Chinese control, including some of the country's biggest
banks and corporations; Merrill Lynch, Husky Oil, and the Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce.
The same thing is happening in other Western countries.
For
example Li Ka-Shing (left) recently obtained two sensitive utility companies
in the UK; EDF electricity that provides electricity to 20 million people
and Northumbrian Water, who provide water to 4 million people.
The Chinese are currently buying vast tracks of farmland in Australia.
The report reveals that the cabal own large chunks of our cities.
For
instance, Li Ka Shing owns,
'one-sixth to one-third of downtown Vancouver.'
They take advantage of under-reported "foreign trade zones" popping up all
over the US. These are semi-autonomous regions exempt from US trade and
customs laws.
A reporter from Veterans Today called up the organizers of a FTZ being set up in his area and found:
'Corporations producing whatever they produce can manufacture and export
products tax-free, but if the products made in the FTZs are sold in the US,
taxes are paid! By us! It's like a reverse tariff!
Americans are punished
for being Americans but foreigners get a free ride. And "American"
corporations get a free ride.'
Chinese corp Sinomach, whose majority shareholder is the
Chinese Communist Party, is planning a technology zone near Boise Idaho that
would be 50 square miles in size.
It would be a self-contained city
encompassing manufacturing facilities, warehouses, retail centers and a
large numbers of homes for Chinese workers.
Imagine it, a slice of China on US soil, what a way to further the 'End of
Nations'!
Will Americans allow this to happen?
Transferring Technology To China
China receives high technology from the West by a variety of means.
One conduit is universities who share the fruits of their research.
Professor C. William Kauffman is a professor of aeronautics engineering at
the University of Michigan, working on military research programs. He claims
his university is,
"transferring every bit of knowledge and know-how that we
have to the People's Republic of China."
This is achieved by allowing
Chinese scientists and students' access to the research process.
Kauffman was incensed when a Chinese agent was appointed the head of his
department. Wei Shyy was born in Taiwan but became a naturalized US citizen
and built himself a very successful career in mechanical engineering. For
decades he was a lead researcher on projects funded variously by the
Department of Defense, NASA and the USAF.
However, throughout his career he has very publicly transferred secrets to
China.
Shyy has been guest professor at various Chinese universities engaged
in military programs, including Nanjing University of Aeronautics and
Astronautics since 1993, Chinese Academy of Sciences since 2000 and the
Beijing Institute of Technology since 2003.
"How can he be allowed access to USAF [and] NASA technology and be a
visiting professor at PRC institutions engaged in the weapons trade?"
Kauffman asks.
"This must violate 'deemed exports' and ITAR [International
Traffic in Arms Regulations]."
In 2010 Wei Shyy left Michigan and became a professor at Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology, taking decades of US technological
development with him.
Western companies who are either bought by - or merge with - Chinese ones
also transfer technology.
Michigan Senator Rick Synder owns a venture capital firm that bought
NeoPhonotics, an American company rich in technological patents but low on
manufacturing ability.
He merged the company with a Chinese firm owned by
the Chinese government. All those American patents are now Chinese!
Occasionally the Chinese receive military technology through official state
deals. For instance, in 1996 Clinton sold China radiation hardened computer
chip sets that are necessary for fighting a nuclear war.
However, such deals cause enormous controversy so the Illuminati prefer
China to attain technology through illegal means.
The Chinese Run The Panama Canal
The Chinese control of the Panama Canal and use it as a smuggling route.
In 1997, Sir Li Ka Shing's company Hutchinson Whampoa attained two 25- year
leases on the harbors at both ends of the Panama Canal.
Declassified documents from the US Commerce Department show that the Clinton
administration stood back despite knowing that that Li has intimate ties to
the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
Li co-owns companies with the PLA. For instance, 25 percent of "Guangzhou
Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Company," a firm run by the Chinese air
force and one-third of AsiaSat, a company owned in part by the Chinese army.
Allowing the cabal to own the Panama Canal, under the guise of a private
corporation, is the perfect way to transfer hi-tech to China.
A intelligence report on Li's takeover concludes:
"Hutchison's containerized
shipping facilities in the Panama Canal, as well as the Bahamas, could
provide a conduit for illegal shipments of technology or prohibited items
from the West to the PRC, or facilitate the movement of arms and other
prohibited items into the Americas."
Conclusion
The scale of Chinese subversion reveals how advanced the New World Order is.
For a foreign elite to get so much power in the West means that our nations
have been completely gutted and cannot be restored to a previous form.
