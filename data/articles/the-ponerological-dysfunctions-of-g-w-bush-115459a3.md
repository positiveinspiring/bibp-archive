The Pathological
Discourse of Bush...

The pathological discourse of Bush and the others is certainly disturbing. I
agree that the questions of ethics that you will discuss in your forthcoming
book "The Code for Global Ethics" is central.
An element that I have found to be of great importance in understanding
these questions is that of psychopathy. The psychopath has no ethics,
no morality, and is incapable of it. He can lie with great facility.
What if psychopaths, although few in number in the general population, were
able to work together to advance their interests, to impose their valueless
view of the world upon others?
It is this question that Andrew M. Lobaczewski, a Polish psychologist
who practiced under Communist rule, treats in great detail in his book "Political
Ponerology: A science on the nature of evil adjusted for political purposes".
The book is the result of decades of secret research carried out in many
countries of Eastern Europe. He noticed, in his clinical work, a high
correlation between acts of violence and other acts we would label as
"evil", and pathologies of various types that were able to be identified in
a clinical setting in the perpetrators. An overwhelming majority of these
acts were carried out by pathological types. He then began working on the
social aspects, particularly in the political process.
Lobaczewski presents in great detail how people suffering with different
forms of pathologies work together to subvert social movements in order to
impose what he calls a pathocracy.
The dynamics of the pathocracy are the
same, regardless of the ideology that served as the original banner
of the movement, which is why we see the same dynamics at play under
communist rule, fascist rule, and, now, democratic rule.
Is every
individual in the family lineage of Bush helpless victims of Political
Ponerology?

The Family of Bush continue business enterprises
that appear to be non-discriminating when it comes to weapons and drugs -
could this be due to paranoidal characteropathia?
During the 1800s F.T. Bush, Esq. of Hong
Kong and his partner Mr. Prescott were responsible for terrorizing
the Asian empire, primarily by and through their illegal drug smuggling
of opium. Furthermore, the ill begotten power structure
Skull and Bones was the model that Russell,
cousin to the Bush Family, co-founded as a respectable club from the
profits gained by and through his partnership with Prescott and F.T. Bush.
Recorded history shows that Skull and Bones has been a primary
filiation for grooming and choosing American presidents. Obviously for
purposes of respectability this prestigious private membership was founded
at the higher education learning institution of Yale, which was also founded
and funded by the illegal drug smuggling fortunes of F.T. Bush, Prescott and
Russell.
Tragically this secret society has been
in the business of terrorizing the United States with the skullduggery of
Pathocracy, since its spawning. This form of governing is what rules
in the United States of America. Certain men formed relationships and
partnerships by and through the most wealthy and powerful families and our
systems governing the business of the USA were created by and through
these elites and their international partners.
Tell tale signs of Political Ponerology: A
Science on The Nature of Evil adjusted for Political Purposes

Subjects are identified in
their early years and then they are molded to serve:
We know today that the psychological
mechanism of paranoid phenomena is twofold: one is caused by damage to the brain tissue,
the other is functional or behavioral. [
]
In persons free of brain-tissue lesions,
such phenomena most frequently occur as a result of being reared by
people with paranoidal characteropathia, along with the
psychological terror of their childhood. Such psychological material is
then assimilated creating the rigid stereotypes of abnormal
experiencing. This makes it difficult for thought and world-view to
develop normally, and the terror-blocked contents become transformed
into permanent functional congestive centers. [

George W. Bush appears to have been
terrorized and tortured on purpose - mentally, emotionally, physically and
spiritually - exactly the same as almost every child born into the family
structure of the military industrial complex of the US: A 2006 study of
child homicide conducted in the USA concluded that the homicide rate of
children raised in military families is much higher than the average and or
typical American home.
This suffering inflicted upon those who are chosen to be indoctrinated
into the system of Pathocracy begins at birth and it continues with a
thorough program of terrorizing every moment of the day for the whole life
of the victim(s).
Take for just one example:
-
How many pharmaceutical drugs do the
handlers of George Jr. pop into him for whatever mood he is to
reflect and emotion he is to suppress?
-
And, how long has this been going on,
with a mother such as the enforcer?
George W. Bush appears to suffer from paranoidal
characteropathia which was inherited from previous affected family
members:
Such Stalinistic characters traumatize and
actively spellbind others, and their influence finds it exceptionally
easy to bypass the controls of common sense. A large proportion of
people tend to credit such individuals with special powers, thereby
succumbing to their egotistic beliefs. If a parent manifests such a
defect, no matter how minimal, all the children in the family evidence
anomalies in personality development.4
His terrorism indoctrination looks like its
some great destiny to fulfill, by being the global decider of the
New
World Order.
This in and of itself appears to have caused him
serious brain synapse illusions. George W. Bush is obsessed with terrorism
and his compulsion with this is unbridled belligerence. He has boasted to
the entire world his full spectrum annihilation by way of a global war on
terror - a long war. This is indeed the Pathocracy of America and
its being forced upon humanity by a president in the United States who was
voted in by and through the democracy of a Supreme Court, 4 of 7, in the
year of 2000.
The psychologically terrorized childhood
memories of George Jr. were spoon fed to him as it had been done for more
than one hundred years before by every Bush Family to their offspring. This
opens the door to other pathological characters who most frequently carry
some inherited psychological deviations. They then push the
characteropathic individuals into the shadows and proceed with their
ponerogenic work. That is why various types of characteropathies
participate in the initial periods of the genesis of evil, both on the
macro-social scale and on the individual scale of human families.5
The United States of America faces the greatest
human rights issue on the planet and it is that our entire system is built
upon the foundation of Pathocracy and the families who have
structured these insane governing bodies are being exposed and appear to be
willing to destroy as many people and the earth as it can, to continue its:
Nature of Evil adjusted for Political Purposes.
An improved social system of the future should thus protect individuals and
societies by preventing persons with the above deviations, or the
characteristics to be discussed below, from any social functions wherein the
fate of other people would depend upon their behavior. This of course
applies primarily to top governmental positions.
Such questions should be decided by an
appropriate institution composed of people with a reputation for wisdom and
with medical and psychological training. The features of brain-tissue
lesions and their character disorder results are much easier to detect than
some inherited anomalies. Thus, stifling ponerogenic process by
removing these factors from the process of the synthesis of evil is
effective during the early phases of such genesis, and much easier in
practice.6
Pathetically
the media is
our worst enemy.
Characteropathies have infected our
news and this could be as a result of the modern drugs which are peddled
routinely and without any protection against what permanent damage it does
to our brains. Numerous medications which are administered for diseases
have been found to cause serious side effects by attacking the nervous
system.
The end result is discreet handicaps and these
can be seen in the personality changes that tend to cause great social harm
through the permanent damage caused to the brain:
Character anomalies developing as a result
of brain-tissue damage behave like insidious ponerogenic factors.
As a result of the above-described features, [ponerogenic influences]
easily anchor in human minds, traumatizing our psyches, impoverishing
and deforming our thoughts and feelings, and limiting individuals and
societies ability to use common sense and recognize a psychological or
moral situation.7
In the journals of time paranoidal
characteropathia is to be Americas Fourth Estate legacy. Again,
economics - capitalism disguised as democracy - controls the reality.8
The fact is, it is almost a mechanical system
that operates based on the psychological nature of human beings, most of
whom like to live in denial or need to live in denial to please their
parents, their peers, their religious leaders, and their political leaders.
All they want to do is have some relaxation to enjoy the American Dream.
After all, if ignorance is bliss, tis folly to
be wise.
This is most especially true when we consider
the survival instinct of the ego. If the official culture - created by
psychopaths - says that there is no man behind the curtain, working
through the inculcated belief systems, there is little possibility that most
people will be able to see the source of the ponerological phenomena in our
world.9
