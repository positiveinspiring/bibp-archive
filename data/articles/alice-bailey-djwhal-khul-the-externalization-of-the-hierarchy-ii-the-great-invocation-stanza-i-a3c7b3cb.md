Great Invocation - Stanza I

Thus all
the great centers are linked and all the planes are interrelated; the past has contributed
its finished work; the present is evoking its just and right development; the future of
wonder and of divine possibility appears - its results contingent upon a spirit of right
understanding and invocation. Three statements in the New Testament begin now to
demonstrate their profound esoteric significance and their amazing living potency:
- I am the Light of the World - The Forces of Light. Phrase 1. - 2nd Aspect.
- My peace I give unto you - The Spirit of Peace. Phrase 2. - 1st Aspect
- Love thy neighbor as thyself - The Men of Goodwill. Phrase 3. - 3rd Aspect
The three aspects of divinity in man achieve practical expression through the influence
of the Great Invocation, both in living usefulness and true comprehension - true at least
in so far as man's present point in evolution permits of his correct apprehension of
significance. Goodwill, as the practical and possible expression of love
demonstrates on earth, evoking right relationship; light, as the expression of the
Hierarchy pours into the human consciousness, irradiating all dark places and evoking a
response from all [165] forms of life in the three worlds of manifestation, and in the
three subhuman kingdoms through the medium of the human; peace, as the expression
of the will of Shamballa produces balance, equilibrium, synthesis and understanding, plus
a spirit of invocation which is basically an action, producing reaction. This demonstrates
as the first great creative and magical work of which humanity is capable, swinging, as it
does, all the three divine aspects into a simultaneous activity in line with the will of
God.
