# BIS - The Most Powerful Bank in The World Announces The Crash

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalbanking353.htm

The Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) is the current situation on the financial markets as
worse than before the Lehman bankruptcy. The warning of the BIS could be
the reason why the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to continue indefinitely
to print money: Central banks have lost control of the debt-tide and
give up.
The decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve
to continue indefinitely to
print
money (here )
might have fallen on "orders from above".
Apparently, the central
banks
dawns that it is tight.
Very narrow.
The most powerful bank in the
world, the Bank for International Settlements(BIS) has
published a few days ago in its quarterly
report for the possible end of the flood of money directly addressed
- and at the same time described the situation on the debt markets as
extremely critical. The "extraordinary measures by central banks" - aka
the unrestrained printing - had awakened in the markets the illusionthat
the massive liquidity pumped into the market could solve the fundamental
problems (more on the huge rise in debt - here ).
This clear words may have meant that Ben Bernanke and
the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed got cold feet. Instead,
as expected, which is now formally announcing the end of the flood of
money, the Fed has decided to just carry on as before.
If one is to the BIS experts believe that
no single problem is solved.
All problems are only increasing.
Because the BIS but apparently does
not know how they get the genie back in the bottle, it
pays to listen to those who were part of the system - but now have no
official functions and therefore more able to find clear words.

BIS
veteran says global credit excess worse than pre-Lehman
Extreme forms of credit excess across the world have reached or
surpassed levels seen shortly before the Lehman crisis five years ago,
the Bank for International Settlements has warned.
The Swiss-based 'bank of central
banks' said a hunt for yield was luring investors en masse into
high-risk instruments, "a phenomenon reminiscent of exuberance prior
to the global
financial
crisis".
This is happening just as the US
Federal Reserve prepares to wind down stimulus and starts to drain
dollar liquidity from global markets, an inflexion point that is
fraught with danger and could go badly wrong.
"This looks like to me like 2007 all
over again, but even worse," said William White, the BIS's former
chief economist, famous for flagging the wild behaviour in the debt
markets before the global storm hit in 2008.

Worst Financial Crisis since
1931? German State-Owned Banks on Verge of Collapse
The German government has had
to bail out state-owned banks with taxpayers' money after their
managements recklessly gambled away billions on subprime
investments. But if a state-owned bank were to go under, the
consequences could be disastrous for the whole economy.

Marc Faber Warns "The Endgame
Is A Total Collapse - But From A Higher Diving Board Now"
"My view was that they would taper
by about $10 billion to $15 billion, but I'm not surprised that they
don't do it for the simple reason that I think we are in QE
unlimited. The people at the Fed are professors, academics. They
never worked a single life in the business of ordinary people. And
they don't understand that if you print money, it benefits basically
a handful of people maybenot even 5% of the population, 3% of the
population. And when you look today at the market action, ok, stocks
are up 1%. Silver is up more than 6%, gold up more than 4%, copper
2.9%, crude oil 2.68%, and so forth. Crude oil, gasoline are things
people need, ordinary people buy everyday. Thank you very much, the
Fed boosts these items that people need to go to their work, to heat
their homes, and so forth and at the same time, asset prices go up,
but the majority of people do not own stocks. Only 11% of Americans
own directly shares."
