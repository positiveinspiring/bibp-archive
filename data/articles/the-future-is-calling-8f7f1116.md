This is Mr. Griffin's analysis of the War on Terrorism and much more.
Terrorism is a distraction for deeper issues. Both hawks and doves are playing into the hands of those who are using the conflict for their own hidden agendas. You will discover the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization that has dominated U.S. public policy since World War I. You will learn about the ideology called collectivism that motivates this group and find that its members believe that the best way to bring about desirable changes in society is to engage in war. Mr. Griffin meticulously documents how these people, working within the American government, plotted to involve the U.S. in both World Wars.
They even encouraged enemy attacks so they could claim the status of victim instead of aggressor.
The lessons and parallels for the War on Terrorism are chilling.
