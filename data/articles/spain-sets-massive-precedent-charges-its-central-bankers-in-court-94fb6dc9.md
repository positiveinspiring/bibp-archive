# Spain Sets Massive Precedent - Charges its Central Bankers in Court

First, Iceland, and now Spain
has taken on
the Big Bankers responsible for
financial calamity, as the country's highest national court
charged
the former head of Spain's central bank, a market regulator, and
five other banking officials over a failed bank leading to the
loss of millions of Euros for smaller investors.
This, of course,
markedly departs from the mammoth taxpayer giveaway - commonly
referred to as the bailout - approved by the U.S. government ostensively to "save" the Big Banks and, albeit unstated, allow
the enormous institutions to continue bilking customers without
the slightest fear of penalty.
Errant bankers
and financiers, it would seem, typically manage to either evade
actually being charged, or escape hefty fines and time behind
bars.
Spain's Supreme
Court last year
ruled
"serious inaccuracies"
in information about the listing led investors to back
Bankia in
error, thus the bank has since paid out millions of Euros in
compensation.
But Spanish
authorities could not abide the telling findings of a years long
investigation into the failed listing, as
Wolf Street
explains,
"As part of
the epic, multi-year criminal investigation into the doomed
IPO of Spain's frankenbank Bankia - which had been assembled
from the festering corpses of seven already defunct saving
banks.
Spain's national court called to testify six current
and former directors of the Bank of Spain, including,
-
its
former governor, Miguel Ángel Fernández Ordóñez
-
its
former deputy governor (and current head of the Bank of
International Settlements' Financial Stability Institute),
Fernando Restoy
-
it also summoned for questioning Julio
Segura, the former president of Spain's financial markets
regulator, the CNMV (National Securities Market Commission - the Spanish equivalent of
the SEC in the US).
"The six
central bankers and one financial regulator stand accused of
authorizing the public launch of Bankia in 2011 despite
repeated warnings from the Bank of Spain's own team of
inspectors that the banking group was 'unviable'."
As
AFP
reports,
"The
National Court validated conclusions made by prosecutors who
concluded that when 'an unviable entity has been listed on
the stock market, its administrators or auditor should not
shoulder all the responsibility'."
Specifics of the
charges have not yet been made apparent, but as
The Economist
reports:
"The court
is questioning why they allowed Bankia to sell shares in an
initial public offering in 2011, less than a year before
Bankia's portfolio of bad mortgage loans forced the
government to seize control of it.
It said there was
evidence the regulators had 'full and thorough knowledge' of Bankia's plight. After its
nationalization, it went on to
report a 19.2bn ($24.7bn) loss for 2012, the largest in
Spanish corporate history."
Internal emails
and documents played a crucial role in ultimately bringing the
central banking officials to task for the failure of Bankia -
inspectors bringing issues to the attention of superiors were
allegedly ignored.
One email cited by
The
Economist came from an inspector who warned Bankia was "a
money-losing machine," for which
an IPO would not
solve.
Another report,
deemed
"devastating by the court,"
saw an inspector advise Bankia to seek a private buyer rather
than proceed with the listing.
An inquiry into,
"the
participation of other players, such as officials in the central
bank,"
was also urged by the National Court.
As The Economist
points out, Spanish judges are generally reluctant to sentence
first-time financial criminals to prison.
Though five
Novacaixagalicia executives had five-year suspended sentences -
levied for embezzlement in 2015 - abruptly enforced in January.
Meanwhile,
taxpayers in the United States have yet to see Big Bankers
criminally responsible for
the financial ruin of so many
Americans brought to any semblance of justice for their
wrongdoing...
