Blackwater
mercenaries are currently overseeing the police in
Greece as rumors of a coup abound.
We understand the situation
is extremely tense and that the mercenaries are there
mainly to protect the Government and parliament should
trouble break out either in the form of a revolution or
counter-revolution.
Already, a destabilization
plot involving the far-right and police has been
uncovered.
Over the last 12 months or more Greece has seen
wave after wave of mass demonstrations, riots, battles between police and
protesters, armed attacks on Government premises,
attacks by fascists (i.e.
Golden Dawn) on migrants, as well as, of course, the complete collapse
of the economy.
The Government has been beset by scandals (e.g.
secret bank accounts in Switzerland) and journalists have been arrested.
Most people now exist day by day via
co-operatives; workers are
taking over the factories.
As we have said, there is a revolution taking
place - a
messy revolution.
And its going to get messier, for the situation
in Greece has now entered a critical phase - here is a summary (with further
details below):
-
Strategy of tension has already
commenced
-
Government is under siege and is
protected by mercenaries
-
Military coup is now talked of openly
-
Insider warns that revolution (or
counter-revolution) is imminent
Strategy of tension
A few days ago we reported on a
plot by the police in collusion with the far-right to instigate a
massacre of police, which would then be blamed on anarchists - presumably
this would then be used as an excuse to introduce martial law or a state of
emergency.
The plot may have been foiled (23 persons were
arrested) by Blackwater working in conjunction with police officers who are
loyal to the Government. Blackwater are expected to continue monitoring
police operations generally, to identify those officers who may be involved
in other, similar plots.
Note
the term strategy of tension came about in
Italy in the 1970s and 1980s when bombings of civilian were committed by neofascist organizations such as
Ordine Nuovo,
Avanguardia Nazionale or
Fronte Nazionale).
Mercenaries protecting
Government under siege
The Greek Government signed a contract with
Academi (the new name for Blackwater) in November last year, though this was
a secret agreement and you will not find details about it on the Academi
website.
News of the contract leaked out end of January
when the Greek ambassador to Canada, Leonidas Chrysanthopoulos, let
slip about it in an interview, which was then published in a
blog (see highlighted sentence in red). The contract with Academi was
confirmed a few days later via the Greek military news site Defencenet.
Blackwater/Academi are infamous as the company
that ran mercenary operations during the last Iraq War and were engaged in
unnecessary fire fights in urban areas, taking civilian lives. They
currently have a
forward ops base in Afghanistan.
We understand their principal role in Greece is
two-fold. One is to oversee police operations. They have been contracted to
do this because the Government are aware that the police have been
comprehensively
infiltrated by members of the fascist Golden Dawn and so cannot trust
the police to stay loyal.
Their other role is to act as a neutral force to
provide full protection to the Government against assault from any quarter.
In effect, the Greek Government is under siege.
Coup possibility
Recently the Government secured an agreement
from the army that under no circumstances would they resort to a coup (as
happened in 1967, leading to the junta of
1967-1974).
Whether this agreement will be honored remains
to be seen.
As Greece is now part of the European Community
a coup will be unlikely, but in the event of heightened tension martial law
could be declared with curfews etc.
Warning of
revolution/counter-revolution
According to Ambassador Chrysanthopoulos in his
interview,
At a certain moment, quite soon, there will
be an explosion of social unrest. It will be very unpleasant.
He then referred to fifteen armed incidents in
the previous ten days, including the firebombing of the offices of the
governing parties and the homes of pro-government journalists, the
machine-gunning of the headquarters of the prime ministers conservative New
Democracy party, and a bomb explosion at a shopping mall belonging to the
countrys second wealthiest citizen.
Chrysanthopoulos predicts the trouble will begin
when new tax bills arrive (soon)
