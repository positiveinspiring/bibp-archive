# Interview with Ex Illuminati Programmer 2 - 16

[Editor's note] Warning: this part contains some graphic
descriptions of assassin training and brutal torture perpetrated on
children by the Illuminati. Svali has asked me to edit the following
account, but I have decided to leave her description of details
intact.
Q: Svali, when you hear news stories about the so-called 'lone
gunman', or perfect patsy, such as Timothy McVeigh, Lee Harvey
Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan, John Hinkley (Reagan assassin),
Eric Harris &
Dylan Klebold (Columbine High School) - and I'm sure you could give
us even more examples - what is your feeling on this? Many of these
killers have links to the military, either directly or through their
family, and are rumored to be mindcontrol slaves, McVeigh supposedly
even had a chip implant.
What's your take on this, is it possible that those men were
mindcontrol slaves and can you give us an idea of how easy (or
difficult) it is to create the perfect MC slave and how they are
trained and controlled? What are signs or clues that would give away
whether these criminals may have been mindcontrolled?
A: I believe strongly that many of these people are people who
had MK ULTRA or military training/assassin training that went "bad".
In fact, I KNOW a few of those guys were, and if you read up on the
cases, there is almost always a mention of Nazi or occult
paraphernalia in the home (unless they have covered it up); web
sites with occult and Nazi symbolism (such as in the Colorado
shootings a couple of years ago at the high school) or other signs
pointing to some amount of involvement in a cult or the occult.
Why do I think they have this training? First, because no one just
picks up a gun one day and learns how to shoot (and hit their
target). Where did these people learn to aim and shoot? Where did
they do their target practice, and develop their deadly accuracy in
many cases?
When I was a trainer in the Illuminati, there was one command that
every trainer learned first when working with their subjects (and
assassin training was then mandatory for ALL children, I went
through it and do not know of any children in the Illuminati who
have not). The command? The "halt" command. This is the FIRST
command put in, it freezes the child or teen or adult in place, and
is ground in.
Why do trainers learn this code first for the person they work with?
Because of the real risk that the person may try to kill them, and
the halt code bypasses this. This is a person who has been
horrendously abused in atrocious ways from infancy on. This is a
person taught since age five to shoot, first with air guns and BB
shot, later real guns, and to practice using VR equipment.
This is a person taught in early childhood to kill coldly and
emotionlessly on command. This is a person who is told to shoot
their brother or sister during a VR exercise, and they believe it is
real under hypnotic trance, to test their "obedience". (They
actually did this horrible thing to my son, and he cried as he told
how anxious he was the next day, and almost died of shock to see his
sister alive and well. That was the ONLY way he knew it had been a
VR exercise and NOT real).
This is a person with endless rage towards their tormentors and
abusers after a lifetime of torture, abuse and rape, who is told to
"use their anger" to make them a better marksmen. This is a person
told that eliminating the ''enemy'' and the weak will bring them
glory and help "family". Now, if that child or teen or adult is
alone and tormented in the daytime, a great anger will build up.
This person becomes difficult to control.
At night, I knew trainers (who were sloppy or pushed too hard) who
were killed by the person they were working on. It was considered
one of the "risks of the job". I was always cautious. All trainers
knew that at night a person might get out of control, it always
happened some. The person was highly punished for it, locked up for
days, tortured, to teach them that it wasn't okay. If the person
became very unstable, they might be considered "expendable" and
eliminated. Or sent to a state hospital, where no one would believe
their "paranoid fantasies" of being taught to assassinate others.
If the brutal and controlling trainers had trouble controlling
people and at times were killed by them, then why wouldn't they
occasionally lose control in the daytime? It happens, and is quietly
covered up (guess how quickly the FBI yanks away incriminating web
sites or occult paraphernali or anything linking the person to an
organized occult group?).
People do not suddenly become killers. It is a
learned process to
overcome the natural horror of killing other human beings, a process
begun in earliest childhood by the Illuminati. You have to FORCE a
child to kill.
Here is how it is done (how it was done to me):
[1] When the child is 2 years old, place them in a metal cage with
electrodes attached. Shock the child severely.
[2] Take the child out, and place a kitten in its hands. Tell the
child to wring the kitten's neck. The child will cry and refuse.
[3] Put the child into the cage, and shock them until they are dazed
and cannot scream any more.
[4] Take the child out, and tell them again to wring the kitten's
neck. This time the child will shake all over, cry, but do it,
afraid of the torture. The child will then go into the corner and
vomit afterwards, while the adult praises them for "doing such a
good job".
This is the first step. The animals get bigger over time, as the
child gets older. They will be forced to kill an infant at some
point, either a set up or VR, or in reality. They will be taught by
age 9 to put together a gun, to aim, and fire on target and on
command. They will then practice on realistic manikins. They will
then practice on animals. They will then practice on "expendables"
or in VR. They will be highly praised if they do well, and tortured
if they don't comply.
The older the child or teen, the more advanced the training. By age
15, most children will also be forced to do hand to hand combat in
front of spectators (high people who come to watch the "games" much
as the ancient gladiators performed). These matches are rarely done
to the death, usually until one child goes down. They use every type
of weapon imaginable, and learn to fight for their lives. If a child
loses a fight, they are heavily punished by their trainer, who loses
"face". If they win, they are again praised for being "strong' and
adept with weapons. By the time they are 21, they are well trained
combat/killing machines with command codes to kill and they have
been tested over and over to prove that they WILL obey on command.
This is how children in the German Illuminati are brought up, I went
through it myself.
Q: Svali, you said earlier that a 'halt' program is one of the first
programs installed in children. What exactly does it consist of? Is
it just a code word, or a more complicated process?
A: Normally, the halt program is a code that freezes the child
or adult in their tracks. It is a combination of numbers, such as
"354" (not a real one, just similar as an example), or a german word
and number combination.
All children will try to hurt their trainers back, it ALWAYS
happens, at a very young age. The part of them that tried to do the
hurting (usually a protector) will be severely punished, with
imprisonment and isolation, or being beaten, or shocked, or a
combination to teach them not to do this.
The halt command will then be put in under hypnosis, while drugged,
after extreme trauma. The alter with the command is told to come out
INSTANTEOUSLY on hearing it, and to freeze the body with no
movement; the person is told that if they fail to do this, many more
torture sessions will follow as punishment. It is reinforced
frequently over time.
