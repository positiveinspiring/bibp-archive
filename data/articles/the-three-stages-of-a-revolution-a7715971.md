Many believe that America is plunging head first into a civil
war with the forces of
the New World Order which have hijacked our
government.
Trust me, nobody reading these words wants live through the
times that the globalists have planned for us and if you listen to people
who advocate for a civil war, you need your head examined.
Part one of this series detailed how the economy is collapsing due the
failure of the Petrodollar. The resulting instability will provide the
pretext to institute a series of false flag attacks which will provide the
federal government with a preemptive opportunity to impose one of the most
draconian forms of martial law that the world has ever seen.
There is a
chance that the American people will shed their shackles and finally rise up
and that is exactly what the globalists desire.
If the globalists can draw us into a civil war and crush the opposition,
they can end all pretenses and their full blown tyranny will be fully
exposed for all to see and experience firsthand.
How close is America to
falling into a civil war?
The Three Stages of a
Revolution
Many believe that the revolution has already
begun and I would agree with them.
There are three distinct stages of
revolution and we are moving down the path to civil war at a frightening
pace. You may not realize this fact, but your government certainly does!
When DHS purchases 2.2 billion rounds of ammunition and 2700 armored
vehicles, it is clear that they are preparing to kill millions of
uncooperative Americans.
Stage One of the Revolution
The first stage of a revolution, is a war of
ideas and a campaign for the truth.
This is what I am trying to accomplish
on my website and on my talk show. Where I see the enemy at the gate, most
of my friends and neighbors are sleeping through the unfolding attack. We
are in a war of words and if we fail to use our words to awaken all of
humanity, we are hopelessly lost and the globalists will carve us up for
dinner.
There is indeed strength in numbers and if we are unable to wake up
our fellow countrymen, we will negate the only true tactical advantage we
have, solidarity from a numerically superior force.
It should now make sense to you as to why
98% of the media is controlled by
globalist controlled business interests, who in turn are controlled one way
or another, by the members of
the Federal Reserve.
In order to win this
fight, we need more people speaking out, making videos and calling MSM talk
shows. We especially need to reach the police and the military in order to
remind them of their constitutional duty to protect the people against a
tyrannical government.
Our counter to
the control of the MSM (Mainstream
Media), is to exclusively support the
alternative media.
If Obama is successful in taking down the alternative
media, then it will become necessary to enact a type of Committees of
Correspondence apparatus similar to what our Founding Fathers did in the
pre-Revolutionary War period in our history.
On the ground communication is
timeless, effective and very difficult for a totalitarian government to
negate.
Stage Two of the
Revolution
Stage two of a revolution consists of civil disobedience or nonviolent
resistance.
Thanks
to
Obama, he has given Americans the perfect pretext to
begin to resist our criminally controlled government and America is
presently sitting on the edge of being immersed in stage two of a
revolution.
I am speaking specifically about gun control.
No matter what gun control laws that Obama
brings to the American people, the people need to disobey.
Most readers
already know what happens when a civilian population surrenders its guns.
When, not if, but when Obama comes for our guns, all of us have a
constitutional duty to disobey these unlawful policies.
If this form of
civil disobedience does not stem the tide of tyranny sweeping the country,
then withhold your money from the globalist apparatus.
-
Stop paying taxes as
much as possible.
-
Do not shop in the corporate chain stores controlled by
Federal Reserve members such as Walmart or any other well known globalist
entity.
-
Shop local and begin to trade and barter with your neighbors and
friends.
-
Buy gold and silver and get off the corrupt Petrodollar as much as
possible.
In short, stop feeding the beast.
Practiced en masse, these
financial practices are often enough to bring a criminal government to its
knees. However, you better store food and water because history shows the
next step that a totalitarian regime would take would be to starve the
people into submission.
Further, we all need to realize that if stage two
does not bring the criminal banksters to their knees, stage three is
unavoidable and that means all out war.
If our resistance is forceful
enough, we may force the globalist cowards to retreat and regroup. Their
hesitation works to our advantage. We can use the time to solidify our
positions and will be in a new position to make demands of the government.
If our civil disobedience is forceful enough, we can make the globalists
think twice about beginning a civil war.
With myself being a nonviolent person, I prefer this path of resistance.
Although I may have been born at night, I was not born last night. The
retreating globalists will eventually return with new methods and strategies
to enslave humanity.
We can only hope that we are united enough to resist
being taken into stage three.
Stage Three - All Out
War
Stage three is direct physical confrontation with the powers that be which
involves a large number of citizens.
In this case, our enemies will be
comprised of whatever minions that the Federal Reserve can bring to the
fight such as a well-armed DHS. If Americans have done their due diligence
in stage one, the majority of the military and the police will defend the
people. However, they must know that the people will stand with them.
These
objectives must be accomplished in Stage one.
A successful revolution cannot simply jump to stage three without having
progressed through the first two stages. The first two stages are the
necessary prerequisites that the globalists require to build the
cohesiveness that they will need to begin the roundups, the murder, the
mayhem and the total subjugation.
False flag attacks are prominent part of
the transition between stage two and stage three rebellion. False flag
attacks also provide the justification and also galvanizes the
pro-governmental forces to a point in which they begin to enslave the
people.
When Stalins forces were dragging a third of the Russians out of their
homes, it was too late for the Russians to fight back because the
ideological base of resistance had not been built. The Russian people were
defeated by Stalin because they did not win stage one of the revolution. We
desperately need to heed this lesson from history and embark on a tireless
crusade to wake up our country as to the dangers that lie ahead.
Therefore,
it is the duty of every awake American to educate their neighbors, family
and friends, whether they want to hear the truth or not.
Remember, any kind
resistance to tyranny will not succeed unless there is an attitude of
defiance towards the tyranny. Tyrants require minions to carry out their
tyranny. Again, this is accomplished, again, in stage one.
If we are going to successfully fight back, it is now or never. Start an
email distribution list. Talk to everyone you know. Post short notices about
the tyrannical government at your community mailboxes. Be creative, think of
new ways to reach your neighbors.
And by the way, buy guns and ammunition.
Hide some of your guns. If possible, buy the guns off the books so there is
not a government list with your name on it.
When martial law is imposed,
have a pre-designated meeting place for you and your family because cell
phone communications may be down.
Carry three days of needed resources in
your cars because you cannot predict when you will experience trouble
getting home.
Form resource coalitions with your friends and coworkers.
Store resources at differing safe houses, in your area, with friends and
family that you trust. Turn off your television which only serves to
condition people to accept defeat and to embrace the plans of
the New World
Order. Build backup plans for your contingency plans.
Start preparing today
like your life depends on it, because it does.
Analysis
I believe that Obamas people will very soon
begin to commence false flag attacks in order to hasten the implementation
of martial law and force the real leadership of the opposition out in the
open where they can be crushed in a brief civil war.
I think the first false
flag event will transpire with
the collapse of the Petrodollar and this will
constitute the countdown to an all-out civil war.
If we can keep the globalists mired in stages one and two, through some of
the suggested actions that I list, we might be able to force a lengthy
stalemate. Time is not on the globalists side because propaganda does not
shield the truth from the masses forever.
This is why the globalists have to
resort to collapsing the dollar and initiating false flag attacks as a means
to force this issue into the third stage.
If a high percentage of the people were prepared to sit out the collapse of
the dollar, through being prepared, and to roll with the punch of the
imposition of martial law as a result of false flag attacks, the globalists
would eventually run out of steam.
We also need to realize that individuals
like
George Soros would even go so far as to start revolutionary movements
as a means to draw out public resistance that could be crushed.
Do you
remember when the globalists got caught funding the
Occupy Wall Street
movement?
Same strategy, same result, and whatever happened to the Occupy
Wall Street movement? The Occupy movement is dead on arrival. The same will
happen with any underground revolutionary movement.
Do not be deceived.
Prepare, pray and let the globalists run out of steam.
Prepare to be outside the grid, outside the food
supply system, outside the need for public services because they will be
used to control the people in times of desperation.
One Caveat
One caveat that every American needs to be aware
of is to securely hide at least one gun that is off the books.
Because if
passive resistance fails, we will need a collective means to defend
ourselves. I believe we can forestall the globalists plans to such a degree
that they will fall apart.
The longer we can delay total subjugation, the
more the globalist minions will see through their evil agenda and come to
realize that they are working towards their own enslavement. This could lead
to great attrition within the ranks of our captors.
The globalists are much
like the boxer in that if he cannot knock out his opponent by the third
round, he will lose because he will run out of steam.
However, if the
globalist trump card is genocide and mass imprisonment, all bets are off. If
genocide and mass detentions were to begin to take place, then you will have
had direct war declared upon you and your family and you will have to act
accordingly.
However, we would be very stupid to engage the enemy on the
battlefield.
Instead, we will need to engage our enemies in an asymmetrical
form of warfare and that will be the topic of the next part of this series.
