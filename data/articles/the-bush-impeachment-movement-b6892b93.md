> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_bushimpeachment.htm

Polls show that nearly a majority of
Americans favor impeachment.
In October of 2005, Public Affairs Research found that 50% of Americans said that President George W. Bush should be impeached if he lied about the war in Iraq.
A Zogby International poll from early November 2005 found that 53% of Americans say, "If President Bush did not tell the truth about his reasons for going to war with Iraq, Congress should consider holding him accountable through impeachment."
A March 16, 2006 poll by American Research Group showed that 42% of Americans favored impeaching Bush.
