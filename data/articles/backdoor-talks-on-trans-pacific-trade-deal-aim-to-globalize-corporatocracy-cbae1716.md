You might think corporate money corrupts our
political system, but the international trade system is where money really
talks.
The White House is touting the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
as a "21st century" trade deal, but many activists see it as a
regression into economic imperialism.
The pact currently in negotiations, covering,
...aims to establish a new trade regime that
could intrude on domestic laws that affect millions of workers and
consumers, from their weekly paycheck to their prescription medicines.

member states of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement
(TPP).

(Malaysia).
The TPP, if current proposals are enacted, would
grant extreme powers for corporations to act as quasi-legal entities, and to
take states to court in order to dismantle environmental, consumer safety,
or labor protections that they feel unfairly pinch their profit margins.
Thanks to some intrepid activists with Public Citizen and the Citizens Trade
Campaign, the public can glimpse at the closed-door negotiations through
a
batch of leaked documents.
So far, whats trickled out suggests that
Washington is determined to
scale up the controversial framework of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), creating a new trade regime
that exploits inequality between workers and employers within countries, and
global inequalities between the developed and developing worlds.
The TPP, if current proposals are enacted, would grant extreme powers for
corporations to act as quasi-legal entities, and to take states to court in
order to dismantle environmental, consumer safety, or labor protections that
they feel unfairly pinch their profit margins.
Building on previous trade agreements like NAFTA
that have given foreign investors sweeping powers to circumvent domestic
regulations, the proposed framework would establish a litigation system
designed to protect the rights of investors above citizens.
Such trade deals have often been marketed to American workers as a boom for
jobs and domestic industries, but theyve generally been condemned by unions
and activists as a lose-lose for workers at home and abroad, encouraging
companies to capitalize on poorer economies where sweatshops can flourish
unfettered by regulatory protections.
Historically, trade deals like
NAFTA and its
Central American counterpart,
CAFTA, are associated with
economic
displacement and instability, the erosion of labor and human rights
standards, and the
subordination of national sovereignty to foreign
investors.
This new partnership aims to lock poorer nations like
Vietnam and
Peru,
which are known for weak labor protections and violations of workers
rights, even more tightly into a labor and trade system in which capital
trumps law.
Meanwhile in emerging economies like China,
often seen as the chief beneficiaries of global trade, such trade deals seem
designed specifically to kick the labor standards even further down.
"A lot of corporations and major retailers
seem to feel that Chinese workers are now demanding too much, that
they're being paid too much, and they want to move offshore to even
lower [paying] countries like Vietnam," says Arthur Stamoulis, executive
director of
Citizens Trade Campaign.
"So this is absolutely about increasing and
furthering the global race to the bottom."
For U.S. workers, Stamoulis says the TPP will
draw workers in both wealthy and poor countries into a hemispheric downward
spiral.
"The more trade pacts we approve like this,
the less and less tax revenue there is for new public services, the
greater the downward pressure on wages and benefits of the jobs that are
left," Stamoulis says.
"This is an example of a trade agreement
that only benefits those at the very top."
Market liberalization has previously
spelled
disaster for many U.S. workers.
The recently finalized
South Korea-U.S. trade
deal, for instance, has been projected to eliminate about 159,000 U.S. jobs,
according to a
2010 study by the Economic Policy Institute, and threatens to
disrupt trade regulations in both nations'
auto industries.
According to Public Citizens analysis, working people might not only face
the threat of job loss under TPP, but also
the undermining of Medicare and
Medicaid programs, new copyright restrictions that
inhibit internet freedom,
or
attacks on the Buy American policy, which promotes the use of U.S. goods
and services for government contracts.
As Josh Eidelson
reported at Salon, union officials have criticized the lack of
transparency in the negotiations and denounced the administrations
pandering to multinationals.
But the secrecy surrounding the agreement
poses
a challenge for labor and community groups, which are isolated both from the
trade talks and from the lawmakers expected to rubber stamp it.
When investors are able to invoke their rights against national
governments, the effects may manifest in unexpected aspects of our lives.
Huffington Post
reports that the pretext of
destroying trade barriers has been used to attack U.S. measures like,
dolphin-safe tuna labeling and anti-teen
smoking efforts.
In one CAFTA investor-state dispute case,
documented by Public Citizen, the Wisconsin-based mining firm Commerce Group
Corporation waged a legal challenge against El Salvador after losing
environmental permits due to a failed audit,
claiming expropriation and denial of fair
and equitable treatment.
Neoliberal ideology has redefined fair and
equitable treatment as deference to corporate sanctity. As the talks speed
ahead, the public may not even become aware of the Trans Pacific Partnership
until it begins to directly harm their livelihoods.
Now the damage is already happening behind
closed doors, as trade officials quietly change the locks on the
institutions that are supposed to serve the public.
