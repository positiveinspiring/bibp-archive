Only twice
before in the history of mankind has this Shamballa energy made its appearance and caused
its presence to be felt through the tremendous changes which were brought about:
- When the first great human crisis occurred at the time of the individualization of man
in ancient Lemuria.
- At the time of the great struggle in Atlantean days between the "Lords of Light and
the Lords of Material Expression."
This little known divine energy now streams out from the Holy Center. It embodies in
itself the energy which lies behind the world crisis of the moment. It is the Will
of God to produce certain radical and momentous changes in the consciousness of the race
which will completely alter man's attitude to life and his grasp of the spiritual,
esoteric and subjective essentials of living. It is this force which will bring about (in
conjunction with second ray force) that tremendous crisis - imminent in the human
consciousness - which we call the second crisis, the initiation of the race into
the Mystery of the Ages, into that which has been hid from the beginning.
The first crisis, as you have been taught, was the crisis of individualization wherein
man became a living soul. The second crisis is the immediate one of racial initiation,
made possible (if you will but believe it) by the many individual initiations which have
lately been undergone by those members of the human family who had vision and a
willingness to pay the price.
