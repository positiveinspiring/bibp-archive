Much has been written about the
ongoing efforts by globalists and the international establishment to
centralize political and economic power.
From,
...all the way to
the
United Nations, would-be transnational authorities are fervently seeking to
consolidate and expand their power over increasingly large swaths of
humanity.
At the same time, though, with citizens becoming increasingly
weary of being ruled by far-away, unaccountable forces, secession movements
around the world are exploding.
Nowhere are independence movements more numerous
and more vocal at the moment than in Europe.
As the emerging Brussels-based
super-state seeks to finalize its smashing of national sovereignty and
self-government across the bloc, whole nations are increasingly in open
revolt.
In the United Kingdom, for example - itself facing the increasingly
likely prospect of Scottish secession - polls show the public is ready to
peacefully extricate the nation from the EU as soon as possible.
The
political class has done its best to contain the anti-EU fervor, but to
little avail.
"In much of the world, small countries are
hoping to retain their independence, whilst portions of larger countries are
trying to establish their independence," wrote economist Jeff Thomas
in
'International Man', a finance-oriented publication.
"Understandably,
they're meeting with resistance, as it's usually the areas that are the
net-contributors to the larger economy that seek independence, whilst the
areas that are the net-recipients wish to take the conglomerate approach
(and to continue to eat their neighbor's lunch)."
Moves to break away from central governments,
Thomas continued, are,
"invariably a bottom-up effort - created by the
people."
Efforts to create "a conglomerate state," on the other hand, tend
to be "top-down - created by the political class," he said, adding that
while in the past that was often done through warfare, today, it often
happens via treaties.
"Political leaders invariably have an insatiable
appetite for gobbling up as much real estate as possible," Thomas observed.
Indeed, across Europe, which has been
united into a pseudo-federation via treaties and agreements imposed on the
public from the top down, political parties openly hoping to withdraw
from the controversial union are
increasingly leading in the polls.
In France, the anti-EU National Front
has been surging, most recently shocking the political establishment with
its
massive gains in local elections this month.
Based on surveys, the pro-sovereignty Dutch
Freedom Party, meanwhile, appears set to dominate the upcoming elections to
the European Parliament. Both of those parties, along with others from
across Europe, are now working together to form
an anti-EU alliance in the super-state's pseudo-legislature.
The end
goal: restore liberty, self-government, and national sovereignty in the face
of an increasingly hostile entity in Brussels.
At the same time, national governments across
much of Europe - especially in the economically battered south - are also
facing secession movements that are threatening to rip apart nations.
In
Spain, for example, the
Basque region has long been seeking
independence. More recently,
separatist sentiment across the Catalan region has become increasingly
widespread as well, with millions of Catalonian citizens
flooding into Barcelona to demand their own nation. Spanish authorities
are currently resisting growing public pressure for a referendum on
independence in the region, but it is not yet clear that it can be contained
forever.
Spain, of course, is hardly alone.
In the United
Kingdom, a September referendum could see Scotland finally regain its
independence from the British government. The most recent polls show the
Scottish pro-independence movement within striking distance of victory -
despite the fact that unlike many other secessionist hotspots around the
globe, Scotland receives more from the central government than it sends in.
Across Wales, too, secession fever is reportedly on the rise.
In Belgium, already widely viewed as a sort of
Frankenstein-like mishmash of disparate peoples under an artificially
created "nation" - something that more than a few EU critics have seized on
as an appropriate metaphor for the super-state itself, which is based in
Belgium's Brussels - efforts to
split up peacefully are also growing in popularity.
Neither the Flemish
nor the Walloons were ever particularly enamored with the current
arrangement, and with the economic havoc escalating, those sentiments have
only been inflamed.
With the implosion of the Italian economy, once
largely marginalized independence movements have recently erupted into
massive secessionist fever across Italy as well. Nowhere, perhaps, was that
more obvious than in Venice, once a powerful and independent city-state. In
a referendum held last month, a stunning 89 percent of voters were in favor
of seceding from the Italian government and the economic disaster it has
sparked. Italian authorities were not amused.
In the relatively wealthy Piedmont region, as
well as the island of Sardinia, secession fever is raging too.
Many citizens
in both areas, which were once united, are hoping to split from Italy and
possibly be annexed by non-EU, liberty-minded Switzerland. Italian
authorities have responded to the various secession movements by deploying
troops, seizing weapons, and arresting dozens of suspected secessionists.
However, that is unlikely to calm the situation down, according to analysts.
Indeed, experts say it is all part of a global
trend.
"We are now experiencing a strong return of little nations, small and
prosperous countries, able to interact with each other in the global world,"
European history professor Paolo Bernardini at Italy's University of
Insubria told United Press International.
"The entire world is moving
towards fragmentation, a positive fragmentation, where local traditions
mingle with global exchanges."
Of course, Europe is hardly alone in the
explosion of secession movements and resurgence of long-simmering
separatism.
The world's newest nation, South Sudan,
became independent from its Islamo-socialist oppressors in Khartoum in
mid-2011 only after a long and hard fight. In South Africa, meanwhile,
growing numbers of European-descent Afrikaners, fed up with
corrupt and discriminatory rule by the African National Congress-South
African Communist Party regime, are pushing for an independent homeland
as well.
Across Asia, secession and independence
movements are gaining ground, too, even under brutally repressive regimes.
The Communist Party dictatorship in Beijing, for example, despite its
efforts to ethnically cleanse occupied Tibet and fill it with ethnic Han
Chinese, is still facing constant opposition from the remote formerly
independent mountain nation.
Separatists in the East have also become
increasingly vocal - and in some cases violent - in the push for liberation
from the communist regime. In Yemen, meanwhile, the south is once again
clamoring for independence despite efforts by the Obama-backed central
regime to quash the movement.
In North America, French-speaking Quebec is
often viewed as the most likely potential candidate for secession from its
national government in the near term, even after a recent defeat for the
separatist party there.
Across the United States, though, facing an
increasingly out-of-control federal government, the topic is once again in
the national headlines, and more serious efforts are starting to emerge. In
2012, citizens from more than 30 states
submitted petitions to the White House for independence signed by many tens
of thousands. That might have been just the beginning.
Of course, in independent-minded Texas,
secessionist rhetoric has never been far from the surface, even among the
highest elected officials. Vermont also has a strong pro-independence
streak.
Many Alaskans, too, often flirt with the idea of an independent
nation free from far-away Washington, D.C., bureaucrats and politicians.
Now, even in Wisconsin, state Republican Party leaders are
dealing with the issue of secession, with a resolution on whether or not
to support the state's right to secede from the union set to be voted on in
early May.
At the same time, regions within American states
are also contemplating and working toward secession from their current state
governments.
From New York and Colorado to California, growing efforts by
conservative-minded regions to
liberate themselves from increasingly out-of-touch "progressive" state
governments are ballooning as well. The process will be tough, but it is
not impossible.
While peoples worldwide increasingly seek to
break away from far-away rulers for various reasons, the globalist
establishment is determined to see the opposite happen. Instead of smaller,
independent nations in control of their own destiny, internationalists are
working fiendishly to both regionalize and
globalize political and economic power.
The EU may be the most obvious
and advanced example, but the trend is happening all over the globe. With
the public increasingly beginning to push back, though, the borders on
future world maps remain far from certain.
