On June 12, a leaked copy of the investment chapter for the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP)
was made public.
This copy was analyzed by Public Citizens
Global Trade Watch and has been
verified as authentic. This agreement has
been negotiated IN SECRET for 2-1/2 years and no information has ever been
released until this leak. So why have the details of this negotiation been
so secret?
This agreement has been framed as a free trade
agreement and yet out of 26 chapters only two have anything to do with
trade. The other 24 chapters grant new corporate privileges and rights,
while limiting governments and protective regulations.
If implemented, this agreement will hard code corporate dominance over
sovereign governments into international law that will supercede any
federal, state, or local laws of any member country.
This document alone should set alarm bells
ringing, but if one steps back and looks at the larger picture, the future
ramifications look even more ominous. After completing this reading, see
what your conclusions are.
This
video is a must see for anyone who wishes to more fully
understand the implications of this secretly negotiated agreement.
This article will also show how if this
agreement is considered in the context of other recently passed legislation
and developments, and the dots are connected, the results would be total
corporate global governance with an accompanying police state.
In this new system the role of elected
governments would be to serve as subservient agents for the transnational
corporations, while the armies, police, and courts would serve the interests
of these transnational corporations. The status of the member states would
be locked-in, similar to countries once they are inside the Eurozone.
The TPP is being negotiated by some of the same characters that brought us
NAFTA, CAFTA and other so called free trade agreements. Some of the
provisions in this document include the establishment of a parallel system
of justice to be administered by 3 attorneys with no conflict of interest
limitations.
This 3 attorney tribunal could order sovereign
governments to use taxpayer money to pay these transnational corporations
for any environmental or regulatory costs that these corporations expended
to meet local standards. Many existing laws would need to be rewritten and
no new regulatory laws could be passed.
Governments that tried to pass regulations such as limits on the financial
industry using risky bets such as derivatives would have the burden of proof
to defend such regulations in a court system controlled by the corporations.
The taxpayers would pay should a corporation
prevail in one of these private courts. In fact over $350 million of
taxpayer money has already been paid out to corporations under the NAFTA
style deals, because of zoning laws, toxic bans, timber rules and other
regulations.
This TPP agreement is like NAFTA on steroids.
This corporate tribunal bears a resemblance to
the private US Supreme Court approved binding arbitration that corporations
use to severely limit an individuals or a groups right to sue for damages.
With
binding arbitration we essentially have a private corporate court
system outside of any government judicial system where the corporations
choose the arbitrators and pay for their services.
This creates an apparent conflict of interest
because the arbitrators know that if they do not rule favorably to the
corporations in the majority of cases, they will not be hired back.
The kangaroo courts setup by this TPP agreement will have binding corporate
guarantees with both trade and cash sanctions.
These cash sanctions would effectively transfer
taxpayer money to transnational corporate coffers. Can you imagine the
excesses we will see in the financial industry as they challenge regulations
within their own private court system forcing governments to pay or
eliminate them?
The result of these corporate tribunals will be
to setup a race to the bottom, where if one country chooses not to regulate
something, then the corporations would be able to sue the other nations
inside of the TPP to have taxpayers cover their losses for any such
regulations. These other countries would be vulnerable to corporate led
lawsuits to be decided in the corporate tribunals.
So how could such an extreme agreement that literally gives corporations
everything they could possibly want have been negotiated with little or no
resistance? The answer is that the ONLY way this agreement could ever pass
is if everything is done in secret and the details never see the light of
day.
Lori Wallach, the director of Public
Citizens Global Trade Watch recently said:
These agreements are a little bit like
Dracula. You drag them in the sunshine, and they do not fare well. But
all of us, and also across all of the countries involved, there are
citizen movements that are basically saying that this is not in our
name. We dont need global enforceable corporate rights. We need more
democracy. We need more accountability."
These talks have been so secret that Senator
Ron Wyden, chairman of the Trade Committee in the Senate which has
jurisdiction over trade agreements has been denied any access to information
on the negotiations for over 2-1/2 years.
This is a man who is on the Intelligence
Committee and has access to nuclear secrets, yet he cannot see this TPP
agreement? On the Democratic side, Senator Wyden has
introduced legislation
to force the Obama administration to make the details of these secret
negotiations available to the Senate Committee.
On the Republican side, Representative Darryl Issa
has also
questioned the Obama administrations extreme levels of secrecy on this
agreement. This is not a liberal cause, this is not a conservative cause,
this is a common cause. It is vital that the public be aware of this TPP
agreement because BOTH of the 2012 presidential candidates are supporting
this agreement.
Since TPP was negotiated under the watch of the
Obama
administration, and Mitt Romney has indicated that he
wants to quickly complete negotiations of this bill, the results of the next
election will be irrelevant to the future status of this bill.
With the corporate takeover of sovereign governments, we see the very
essence of a global fascist system. When most people think of fascism, they
think of Hitler brown shirts marching through the streets, however, that is
not the real definition of fascism.
Fascism was defined by President Franklin
Roosevelt:
The liberty of a democracy is not safe if
the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it
comes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence,
is fascism - ownership of government by an individual, by a group
Polls show that most Americans from both major
political party believe that money exerts far too much influence on public
officials, effectively making these elected officials the hired servants
of the wealthy elites.
Both the Tea Party and the Occupy
Movement believe that there is too much influence of money on our
legislators. Our representatives are essentially the puppets while the
corporate elites are the puppeteers. What this TPP agreement does is to take
this puppet metaphor to the international level.
Our elections have been reduced to the people
choosing who will be the hired servants of the power elites from a list
preapproved by these same elites.
This TPP agreement is nothing less than a power grab by the largest
corporations on the planet to establish a legal framework for global
corporate government making all sovereign governments subject to
international law enforced by corporations. Passage of this bill would
essentially be corporate coup against all member states.
So while this TPP agreement should frighten anyone who is still breathing,
the threat does not end as the corporations make their ultimate grab for
power.
Here are some of the other forces that are
potentially focusing the power of the corporate state:
National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 (NDAA)
With the passage of the NDAA, our
legislators overrode constitutional protections so that Americans who
are suspected of providing material support to a terrorist
organization can be detained indefinitely on American soil, without
access to legal counsel, and without any charges being filed.
Think about this for a minute, you do not
even have to be charged with a crime and you can be locked up
indefinitely? What exactly does material support mean? Exactly what is
a terrorist?
Some states have actually declared that
people who secretly video record animal mistreatment as terrorists,
even if no property damage was done. If nonviolent protests can be
declared as terrorist acts, it does not take a great leap of the
imagination to see how NDAA might be applied.
Imagine if the government used NDAA
legislation against journalists or whistleblowers such as Julius Assange,
Russ Tice, or even Daniel Elsberg? How will we ever know what is
happening in a corporate state if the corporations are successful in
indefinitely detaining those who would shed light on their activities?
This NDAA is another example of dangerous legislation being passed in
darkness.
This bill was signed by Obama on December
31, 2011, during the Christmas break when the media attention would be
minimal. In an effort to divide the opposition to the indefinite
detention of Americans, Obama promised that his administration would
never use the provisions.
The questions most people should be asking
is:
what is to prevent any future president
or even Obama himself from using indefinite detention, and if there
is no need for concern over this, why was it necessary to make that
signing statement?
Progressive and conservative groups such the
ACLU, Gun Owners Foundation, Tea Party Movement, Institute of the
Constitution, US Justice Foundation, Tenth Amendment Center, Occupy Wall
St, and many other groups are joining forces to fight this legislation.
On social media, resistance in the form of a
Facebook group called Recall Every Congressman Who Voted for NDAA has
been formed. Now, in the context of the TPP, think of how useful this
NDAA law could be to a global corporate government in silencing its
critics.
Citizens United Ruling
Americans have long had a
sneaking suspicion that there was a hidden hand directing our
government in Washington and the states, and they were right.
The hidden hand was actually the
corporations, unions, and other self-serving special interests that
contribute literally $billions to our politicians in order to influence
legislation that will favor them.
This has happened even with limits that had
been placed on these groups that prevented them from directly
contributing to campaigns. Thursday January 21 2010, will go down in
history as a dark day. This is the day that a divided Supreme Court, in
the Citizens United v. FEC ruling, removed all limits on corporate
political campaign spending.
If you thought our politicians were corrupt
and beholden to corporations before, things are about to get a LOT WORSE
now that all limits have been removed. Justices Roberts, Alito, Scalia,
Thomas and Kennedy swept aside decades of legislative restrictions on
the money from corporations in political campaigns and ruled that
companies can use corporate funds to support or oppose candidates.
This ruling will certainly take its place in
history alongside other shameful rulings such as Dred Scott v.
Sandford, and Plessy v. Ferguson.
These 5 justices opened the floodgates of
unlimited funds to influence elections. The strangle hold the banks have
over the nations wealth will now be amplified by this Supreme Court
ruling now that all limits on campaign financing by corporations have
been removed.
This black day will go rightly go down in history where the Supreme
Court officially validated the takeover of the government by the
corporations. The 2012 primary election cycle has already seen where
approximately 4 dozen people have contributed massively to the super
PACS and decided the outcome of the elections.
This type of money influence will cut both
ways regardless of which political party you support. One donor has
stated that he is willing to spend $100 million in this election cycle.
This one single donor donated the same amount as 2 million families
sending a check for $50. This type of funding by large donors undermines
the very foundation of our government and creates an environment
conducive to corruption.
Now in the context of the TPP, think of the
impact that huge global corporations will have on governments with their
ability to spend unlimited money anonymously.
Corporate domination of media
Media ownership has now become so
concentrated that
six corporations effectively control US media today.
These companies are,
-
Time Warner
-
Walt Disney
-
Viacom
-
Murdochs News Corp
-
CBS Corporation
-
NBC Universal
With this type of concentration, it becomes
very difficult to find diversified news in order to form independent
opinions. One aspect of this concentration is the increasing number of
negative political ads, many of which have no accountability as to their
factual accuracy.
This will end badly if we do not stop the
media from undermining the foundations of our election system. This
concentration of media ownership allows billionaires and corporations to
ensure that the politicians who will work to pass self serving
legislation favoring these wealthy elites are elected to office.
One place where the corporate media has not met with great success in
controlling is the independent media on the Internet.
Attempts have been made to control access to
it, to create toll system, as well as extreme copyright rules. We
have seen a veritable alphabet soup of acts designed to enhance
corporate profits and limit the flow of information.
Some examples
include PIPA, SOPA, CISPA, and
it seems as soon as they are knocked down due to public resistance,
another threat arises. For now, the Internet has remained free and a
diverse source of information, but vigilance must be maintained.
Now, think of the effect that the loss of an
open Internet and the increasingly concentrated media ownership will
have on the electorate when combined with the unlimited funding that the
Citizens United ruling allows, as well as the power that the
transnational corporations could gain under TPP.
Increasing Use of Drones for Domestic Surveillance
The use of drones for domestic
surveillance is becoming more and more common.
The FAA has approved drones for use over the
United States and projects that 30,000 drones will be over our skies by
2020. The EPA is actually using drones to monitor cattle ranchers in
Iowa, police and universities are using them, and cities are using
drones to keep an eye on things.
New much smaller drones the size of birds
and insects are now in development.
These smaller drones will be cheaper to
produce and deploy which will likely raise the 30,000 estimate
significantly and will be much harder to detect. Under a government
subservient to the corporations, these drones would effectively be
controlled and regulated by the corporations.
Can you imagine the misuse of this
technology to violate any privacy we may have left and to conduct
clandestine surveillance?
Militarization of Police Forces
The
militarization of our police
forces is proceeding rapidly.
After 9-11, the Department of Homeland
Security gave generous grants to police forces across the nation. Some
of the purchases included riot gear, armored personnel carriers, and
even acoustic weapons for small towns. A nexus has formed between
vendors of military equipment and the nations police forces.
There are certainly consequences to this
militarization of police forces. Once a police officer is deployed into
a situation with full riot gear and military training, the chances of
violence increases significantly even when the protests remain peaceful.
There is significant evidence of this during the Occupy demonstrations.
The roles of police and military are totally different. The police are
trained to protect lives, the military is trained to take lives.
Consider how these same military trained
riot police would be used when they are under the effective control of
the transnational corporations and how they would be utilized to silence
their critics.
Privatization of Prisons
The privatization of prisons is
expanding rapidly.
In most societies prisons are run by the
state where the incentive is to have fewer prisoners with a lower
recidivism rate. In a private system the perverse incentive is to
maximize the number of prisoners, and raise the recidivism rate in order
to maximize profits. This results in higher numbers of prisoners, broken
families, poor healthcare for inmates, and few resources spent to
prepare inmates to reenter society.
This has contributed to the shame of the US
having
largest prison population on the planet whether measured in
absolute numbers or on a per capita basis, with most prisoners serving
time for non-violent crimes.
The private for profit prison industry is
growing and has actually influenced immigration legislation in Arizona
in order to gain more inmates and raise profits. Think of the impact
that private prisons, private policing, private contractors providing
soldiers for hire, all with loyalty to $$$ instead of their country.
We will quickly devolve into a fascist
controlled state.
This aspect of corporate control should be
one of the most frightening to everyone who holds freedom and democracy
dear.
Lack of Prosecution For Financial Fraud
If a criminal gets away with
committing a crime, there is a strong likelihood that they will commit
it again.
The lack of prosecution for the major
financial fraud that brought about the 2008 economic collapse almost
guarantees that it will happen again. Justice Department officials have
stated that these are difficult and complex cases.
However, during the Savings & Loan crisis,
there were thousands of successful felony convictions, despite the fact
that it was 1/70 the size of the 2008 crisis. In fact when the 50
Attorneys General were close to starting their own prosecutions due to
the lack of any federal action, the Obama administration stepped in and
negotiated its own agreement.
To
paraphrase David Petrovich, the Executive Director for Society
For Preservation of Continued Homeownership:
This agreement granted immunity to the
big banks for the criminal
robosigning where they forged documents
and fraudulently tried to present them in courts across the country.
This was essentially another bailout of
the banks only this time the bailout was not in the form of money,
but rather where changes were made in the law to retroactively
transform banks illegal behavior into legal behavior. (Watch how
this concept of retroactive immunity comes up again.)
Think about what would happen if you or
I forged notarized signatures and tried to pass them off in court.
We certainly would serve prison time. Yet, these huge banks were let
off the hook even after forging tens of thousands of these
signatures and illegally foreclosing on peoples homes.
We also recently had the spectacle of the
Senate Banking Committee questioning one of its largest donors.
While wearing presidential seal cuff links,
presumably to show his powerful connections, JP Morgan chair Jamie
Dimon, easily handled all the softball questions asked of him. Dimon
lost over $3 billion (and growing) on risky derivative bets and yet
these same senators actually had the audacity to ask him for input and
advice on regulating his bank.
Think about the implications of total
immunity from prosecution for financial crimes in an environment where
the TPP has been approved and global corporations are the effective
government.
Lack of Protection for Whistleblowers
The increasing
prosecution and
harassment of whistleblowers has a chilling effect on government
transparency.
The government often prosecutes the
whistleblower rather than the crime that the whistleblower reveals. The
Obama campaign in 2008 promised to protect whistle blowers, but instead
he has been waging a relentless war against them.
Bradley Manning was declared guilty
by Obama BEFORE he was even charged with any crime, yet the shooting of
the journalists by the US helicopter crew and their callous statements
during the shooting was ignored.
When William Binney blew the whistle
on the NSAs huge surveillance program, the FBI raided his home in an
effort to quiet and intimidate him. Corporations as well as government
also often retaliate against whistle blowers.
In a corporate state, how would the citizens
know about the activities of the corporations if there is no protection
for whistleblowers?
Corporate Spying On Americans
The information William Binney
made public dramatized the huge scale of the (at that time ) illegal
surveillance that was being done on Americans.
It also included the fact that AT&T as well
as other communication companies were deeply involved in this illegal
spying on US citizens. Later, as lawsuits against the corporations
started to look like they would be successful, the Obama administration
claimed state secrets to kill the lawsuits.
Since the telecommunications industry is
another VERY large contributor to political loyalists, Congress showed
its gratitude by passing legislation to grant the telecommunication
companies retroactive immunity. (This concept retroactive immunity comes
up again.)
The questions that should come to mind are:
if no crime was committed, why were the
corporations granted retroactive immunity, or if crimes were
committed, why were these corporations granted retroactive
immunity?
Think of the implications of this in a
corporate state, with the increasing use of smaller and smaller drones
in an environment that allows corporations to legally spy on you. Then
also consider this concept of governments granting retroactive immunity
for criminal actions in order to please their major corporate donors.
How will the transnational corporations use
these tools to maximize their profits or to silence opposition?
Summary
What we see is a confluence of forces that has the potential to solidify a
shift towards corporate fascism and encase it in international law.
Governments will merely be the tools of the
corporations to provide a degree of separation from the inevitable police
state that will accompany this corporate global governance. Sovereign
governments even with all their failings still have at least some concern
for the general welfare of their citizens.
Corporations by their very nature have only one
purpose and that is to generate profits. If an individual whose sole purpose
was to blindly enhance profits, without any regard to the standards of what
is wrong and what is right in society, would likely be considered a
sociopath by mental health experts.
If the TPP were to be enshrined into international law, these same sociopath
corporations would now lord over sovereign governments, indifferent to
criminal law, and beyond the control of nation-states. They would have the
ability to utilize the militaries of some states to wage war on other less
complaint states.
Doug Casey of Casey Research recently
wrote:
Its most unfortunate, but the US and its
allies will turn into authoritarian police states.
Even more than they
are today. Much more, actually. Theyll all be perfectly fascist -
private ownership of both consumer goods and the means of production
topped by state control of both.
Fascism operates free of underlying
principles or philosophy; its totally the whim of the people in
control, and theyll prove ever more ruthless.
There are those who would say that it is
unpatriotic to be against corporations, however should corporations be in
the business of governing? An open public debate on the future role of
corporations is needed.
It is vital that the details of this TPP agreement become widely known and
circulated. Once it sees the light of day, it will be defeated because
people will oppose it.
Sorry, corporations really are NOT people, they
are merely state created entities.
What Can You Do?
Get money out of politics
Until we get money out of politics, corporate control of our government will
continue and because of the Citizens United ruling, will most likely
increase.
Attempts at a corporate coups such as this TPP
agreement will continue and will keep resurfacing in various re-invented
forms until one day one will be successful. We have already seen this
pattern with the repeated attempts to impose limits the Internet. There are
organizations that are working towards eliminating the corrupting influence
of money.
Find out more about them and support their
efforts.
Some of them include:
End the secret TPP
negotiations
Until we bring this process into public view, there is the danger that it
will be passed quickly and secretly with little or no congressional or
public input. Once the details of these agreements are made public, the TPP
will defeated, or at the very least modified.
There are organizations that are fighting this TPP agreement and they
deserve your efforts and support.
Some of them include:
We have reached a crossroad where either we
allow the corporations to take control of our nations, or we stop them in
their attempts. Take an evening off from the TV and make the effort to make
a difference so that you leave your children a better future.
Dont expect others to do this vital task.
