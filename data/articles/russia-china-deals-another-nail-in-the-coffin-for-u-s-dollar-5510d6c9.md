The Kremlin and the Communist Chinese regime,
through their state-controlled "companies," have been signing major deals
with each other that analysts say will contribute to the acceleration of the
U.S. dollar losing its status as the global reserve currency.
Two agreements in recent weeks deserve special
attention:
The geopolitical implications of the
quickly-moving trends are monumental - especially for the United States,
where the end of dollar hegemony will lead to potentially unprecedented
economic upheaval.
Of course, it is hardly a secret that the
upper echelons of the globalist establishment are plotting to
end the decades-old reign of the U.S. dollar.
As top insiders have openly admitted, the
end goal is to replace it with a planetary monetary regime and
global currency operated by the International Monetary Fund, which would
act as a sort of
world central bank.
All of it has been happening with the
deliberate connivance of Western globalists, including the banking cartel
that
owns and controls
the Federal Reserve. The IMF is already talking openly
about
moving its headquarters to Beijing and turning its Special Drawing
Rights (SDR) into
a true global currency.
Now, the trends appear to be picking up speed.
The U.S. central bank, for example,
continues conjuring outlandish amounts of currency into existence under
the guise of keeping interest rates low and stimulating an "economic
recovery."
Around the world, foreign governments and
central banks - particularly the regimes ruling
the so-called "BRICS": Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa -
are reacting by quietly moving away from the U.S. dollar.
Authorities in those nations have also been
purchasing massive amounts of gold, which countless experts say is
having its price suppressed by Western central banks.
The latest Sino-Russo agreements, though, mark
an important milestone in the ongoing flight from the dollar. The first deal
on May 20, dubbed the "Agreement on Cooperation," was inked in Shanghai
between two state-owned banking leviathans as Communist Chinese dictator
Xi Jinping and Russian strongman Vladimir Putin looked on
approvingly.
As part of the deal, the Communist Chinese
regime-owned Bank of China and the Kremlin-owned VTB agreed to settle
transactions in yuan and rubles.
"Under the agreement, the banks plan to
develop their partnership in a number of areas, including cooperation on
ruble and [Chinese]
renminbi settlements, investment banking, inter-bank
lending, trade finance and capital-markets transactions," VTB said in a
statement.
Putin was glowing, too.
"Our countries have done a huge job to
reach a new historic landmark," he was quoted as saying in news reports,
adding that bilateral trade was growing quickly and set to expand
further in the coming years.
"China has firmly settled in a position of
our key trade partner.
If we sustain this pace the level of bilateral
trade of $100 billion will be reached by 2015 and we'll confidently move
on."
Other Russian and Chinese officials also
expressed delight with the developments as the Obama administration blabbers
about "climate change," red lines, and gun control.
Obama has also invited
Communist Chinese and
Russian troops to train on U.S. soil. .
Most importantly, perhaps, the agreement
sidelines the U.S. dollar, which has served as the global reserve since the
end of World War II. At first, America's currency obtained the role by
default, maintained largely because it was backed by gold as much of the
world lay in ruins.
Following then-President Nixon's final severing
of the remaining tenuous link to precious metals, the dollar remained on top
because energy supplies around the world were priced in dollars - the
so-called "petrodollar."
While the status quo has offered some temporary
"benefits" to the United States, allowing it to export fiat currency in
exchange for goods and services, for example, the biggest downsides of the
system appear to be approaching quickly.
After the banking deal, Putin and Xi also
oversaw the signing of a
gargantuan natural-gas contract between state-controlled energy giants
owned by their regimes.
Under the $400-billion agreement, apparently
years in the making, the Kremlin's
Gazprom will deliver some 40 billion
cubic meters of natural gas to the state-controlled China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC) each year. While most of Gazprom's foreign contracts for
energy are still priced in dollars, analysts said the Sino-Russo deal was a
significant move in terms of undermining the U.S. currency in international
trade.
Meanwhile, in Europe, Gazprom bosses are also
threatening to start seeking payment in Euros.
"This shows that in principle there is
nothing impossible - you can switch from dollar to euro and from euro,
in principle, to rubles," Alexander Dyukov, CEO of the massive
state-owned energy giant's oil division, was quoted as saying in Russian
news reports while touting the ditching of the U.S. dollar in
international trade.
The dictatorship in Belarus has already
announced its support for the move.
The regimes also released a joint
Chinese-Russian statement amid the deals suggesting that more was yet to
come.
"The sides intend to take new steps to
increase the level and expansion of spheres of Russian-Chinese practical
cooperation, in particular to establish close cooperation in the
financial sphere, including an increase in direct payments in the
Russian and Chinese national currencies in trade, investments and loan
services," it said.
In other words, expect more orchestrated efforts
to sideline the dollar in favor of other currencies in the not-too-distant
future.
Independent analysts also warned of the growing
pressure on the dollar.
"Taken alone, these actions do not mean the
end of the dollar as the leading global reserve currency," explained
author and currency expert Jim Rickards, a partner at Tangent Capital
Partners who has written extensively on the global monetary system.
"But, taken in the context of many other
actions around the world including Saudi Arabia's frustration with U.S.
foreign policy toward Iran, and China's voracious appetite for gold,
these actions are meaningful steps away from the dollar."
The Communist Chinese regime remains the largest
single holder of dollars and dollar-denominated assets, but that could
change quickly.
Meanwhile, aside from the major deals signed in
the presence of Putin and Xi, Kremlin-funded media and even some elements of
the establishment press have been highlighting Russia's ongoing campaign of
de-dollarization.
"Over the last few weeks there has been a
significant interest in the market from large Russian corporations to
start using various products in [Chinese] renminbi and other Asian
currencies, and to set up accounts in Asian locations," Deutsche Bank's
Russia chief Pavel Teplukhin was quoted as saying in RT and the
Financial Times.
Deutsche Bank bosses, the
Financial Times, and the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee were
all represented at
the Bilderberg summit two weeks ago.
Establishment analysts were publicly busy trying
to paint the deals as a joint effort between Russian and Chinese authorities
to undercut the United States based on "mutual strategic interests" as
opposed to something more sinister.
However, as The
New American reported in late May, the
deal also seems to confirm the revelations of Anatoliy Golitsyn,
the highest-ranking KGB agent to ever defect to the West.
In two books, Golitsyn argued that the
"Sino-Soviet Split" was a long-range deception to fool the West.
"When the right moment comes the mask will
be dropped and the Russians with Chinese help will seek to impose their
system on the West on their own terms as the culmination of a Second
October Socialist Revolution,'" he wrote in 1995.
Of course, the privately owned Federal Reserve
is itself
demolishing the U.S. dollar at warp speed via "quantitative easing,"
bailouts for crony mega-banks around the world, and other wealth-transfer
gimmicks.
At the same time, the federal government is
pummeling what remains of the U.S. economy with a broad range of schemes
such as
FATCA, citizenship-based taxation, avalanches of unconstitutional
regulations, executive decrees rationing energy, outlandish borrowing and
spending sprees, and more.
Combined with the
orchestrated global move away from the dollar by the
establishment and its BRICS allies, analysts say time is running out
quickly for Americans to stop a looming economic calamity.
