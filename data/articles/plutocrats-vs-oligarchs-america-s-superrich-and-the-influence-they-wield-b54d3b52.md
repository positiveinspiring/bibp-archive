The Supreme Court's recent decision, McCutcheon vs. FEC, granted
further political influence to
the
1 percent, enabling them to spend as much as they wish
influencing political campaigns.
It followed the Court's 2010 ruling, Citizens
United vs. FEC, allowing the rich to spend unlimited sums on political
advertising. Some wonder if this is not a 21st century
form of buying an election?
Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) lamented the toll these decisions will
likely have on American popular democracy.
"If present trends continue, elections will
not be decided by one-person, one-vote," he warned.
He added,
"this process - a handful of the wealthiest
people in our country controlling the political process - is called
'oligarchy'."
Sanders acknowledged the potential consequences
of the Court's decisions:
"The great political struggle we now face is
whether the United States retains its democratic heritage or whether we
move toward an oligarchic form of society where the real political power
rests with a handful of billionaires, not ordinary Americans."
The contemporary concept of oligarchy was
popularized by the Russian experience.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union,
innumerable state companies were privatized. The country was in disarray
and, in an effort to stabilize the economy, the Yeltsin government
"redistributed" state-owned enterprises to trusted cronies.
They came to wield unprecedented power over the
economy, the state apparatus and the mass media.
The term "oligarchs" is gaining currency in the U.S. Sanders defined them
as,
"a small number of very wealthy families who
spend huge amounts of money supporting right-wing candidates who protect
their interests."
He means to differentiate this "small number"
from the larger world of the rich and superrich, the plutocrats, who - as a
class - have long exercised considerable influence on the U.S. political
system.
-
Who are these oligarchs and how do they
different from today's plutocrats?
-
And how does this generation of
oligarchs differ from previous generations of the superrich who,
over the last century, have dominated American politics?

Oligarchy is defined as "government by the few" and came into English
use around 1570. The term derives from two Greek words: oligos
meaning "few" and arch for "rule"; similar English-language terms
include monarch or hierarchy.
Plutocracy is derived from the Greek
ploutos meaning "wealth" and kratos for "govern."
Today, both concepts - plutocrats and oligarchs - refer to the growing
influence the rich - and especially the superrich - have on the national
(and international) political economy.
Oligarchs are plutocrats who use their
enormous wealth to further a particularly conservative, if not rightwing,
agenda.
Thomas Piketty's study, 'Capital in the Twenty-First Century',
reveals that the U.S. - along with much of the advanced capitalist world -
is returning to what economist Paul Krugman calls the "new Gilded
Age."
Piketty finds that that in 2010, the top 1
percent controlled 20 percent of U.S. income and, together with the next 9
percent, the superrich controlled 50 percent of all income.
The IRS recently noted that in 2011, 11,445 U.S.
taxpayers declared incomes of more than $10 million.
According to Forbes, the three richest Americans in 2013 were:
They may well be plutocrats in the old-fashioned
sense of,
But are they oligarchs?
Michael Bloomberg was New York's mayor for 12 long years and is
ranked 10th on Fortune's list of wealthiest Americans with
a net worth of $31 billion. He leveraged his public position and private
wealth vigorously promoting two pet projects,
gun control and obesity.
Both initiatives stalled in the political
marketplace.
Is he an oligarch?
Today's grand plutocrats include,
-
the Walton family
-
the Koch brothers
-
Sheldon Adelson
They makeup seven of the top 11 wealthiest
Americans:
This is 'real' money.
These plutocrats become oligarchs by employing their vast wealth in an
apparently more aggressive - and conservative - way then, for example,
Gates, Buffet or Bloomberg.
The Koch brothers are major backers of the Tea
Party and Americans for Prosperity; they are reported to have donated an
estimated $196 millions to fight the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).
The Waltons have led the charge against public
education, committing an estimated $1 billion promoting privatization - no
teachers' union or community accountability - through charter schools.
Adelson famously holds court for Republican
presidential hopefuls who visit his Las Vegas castle to kiss his ring and
proclaim their undying support for Israel.

America is stuck. The "American
Century" is over and
globalization is restructuring capitalism.
The rich are getting phenomenally richer while
the income of the rest of Americans stagnates or falls. Both American
plutocrats and oligarchs are fighting to hold on to - and increase! - their
wealth and influence during this restructuring. And they are succeeding.
Over the last quarter-century, globalization has spawned a new class of
superrich who wield historically unprecedented power.
This elite truly enjoys the privileges of its social status,
operating on its own economic, political and moral terms. It's a value
system shared by plutocrats around the globe.
They endow cultural institutions, their names
shameful promoted; they are delivered anywhere on the globe via private
jets; they are escorted in chauffeured limousines through busy city streets;
and they are celebrated at exclusive get-togethers like the Davos World
Economic Forum.
Like nobility of old, the obsequies media
present them - like other celebrities - in the most favorable light.
In the U.S., pay-to-play payoffs - whether in cash or kind - define everyday
politics.
Local Chambers of Commerce, real-estate
interests, financial players, large retailers, trade associations, unions
and other special interests lubricate the wheels of government. Lobbyists
facilitate, legislators dutifully legislate, deals are cut, someone wins and
- in most cases - the vast majority of ordinary Americans loose. It's the
way the game is played.
However, the U.S. is not Russia, let alone Greece or Afghanistan or almost
anywhere else around the globe.
Most U.S. officials don't take cheap bribes.
Corruption takes place, but low-level scammers, whether from the private or
public sector, are regularly busted. However, when it comes to real money,
that's another story.
American plutocrats are at the top of the political food-chain.
Their wealth buys influence. They use their
financial power to determine public policy, involving laws, court decisions,
tax codes, zoning ordinances, corporate subsidies, outsourcing and
purchasing contracts.
Their wealth enables them to promulgate their
self-serving vision at the local, state and federal levels, benefiting every
step of the way. They link economic policy to social programs, seeking to
dictate civic values - public morality - with regard to abortion rights,
teen sex and gay rights.
This is nothing new. For more then a century, plutocrats have used their
wealth to influence public policy. In the fin de si√®cle era, modern,
industrial capitalists like Rockefeller and Carnegie remade America,
promoting not only free-market capitalism but
eugenics as well.
These grand oligarchs garnered their wealth the
old-fashioned way, by brutally exploiting their wage-labor workers. And in
those good-old-days, politicians were really for sale, no questions asked.
And then came the Progressives.
Ford - and the Fordist manufacturing process - defined the modern
era. He introduced the assembly line and the $5-per-day salary - ostensibly
so his workers could buy the cars they made.
The collapse of
the Great Depression stalled economic
growth. The enormous expansion of the national economy during World War II
and the post-war recovery made Ford # 1.
Ford symbolizes the highpoint of consumer
capitalism. And then came globalizations and a new generation of plutocrats
and oligarchs.
In 1937, amidst the Great Depression, Ferdinand Lundberg published an
influential book, 'America's 60 Families'. It revealed the financial and
political power of the nation's great fortunes. Nearly three-quarters of a
century ago he warned:
The United States is owned and dominated today by a hierarchy of its sixty
richest families, buttressed by no more than ninety families of lesser
wealth
These families are the living center of the
modern industrial oligarchy which dominates the United States, functioning
discreetly under a de jure democratic form of government behind which a de
facto government, absolutist and plutocratic in its lineaments... It is the
government of money in a dollar democracy.
Its more important then every to wonder just how much has changed.
A century ago the Progressive movement, led by,
-
Lincoln Steffens
-
Ida Tarbell
-
W.E.B. DuBois
-
Teddy Roosevelt,
...focused national attention on the robber
barons.
The
Occupy Movement focused popular attention
on the 1 percent. Inequality - and the growing power of the oligarchs - is
becoming a national political issue, most evident in the election of Bill
de Blasio as New York's mayor.
Today's plutocrats and oligarchs, backing both Democrats and Republicans,
have failed to deliver. They've backed two expensive - in dollars and blood
- failed foreign military interventions.
They championed financial and economic policies
contributing to the great recession of 2008-2010 from which the nation has
yet to fully recover. And they've made the lives of ordinary Americans
harder, materially worse. Their policies have failed, yet they remain in
power.
For many Americans,
Obama was the great black 'hope' who
realized far less then hoped for. He did move (however slowly) to end the
military misadventures in Afghanistan and Iraq. And he did secure
the passage of Obamacare, a possible stepping-stone to a national,
single-payer program.
Yet, he dutifully bailed out the banks and
let walk the perpetrators of
the financial crisis. And he's backed
the most reactionary immigration and intelligence policies as well as
promoted the worst trade pact (the
Trans-Pacific Partnership) since NAFTA.
In the U.S. ready for four, if not eight, more years of another centrist
Democrat?
Hillary Clinton will likely only be Obama-heavy.
If elected, Clinton will have much to prove, especially that she's tough.
The plutocratic ruling class has no national answer, a workable program, to
address the changes the nation faces amidst capitalism's global
restructuring.
Their goal is to maximize private gain at the
expense of the vast majority of ordinary Americans. And
Clinton, like her husband before her,
will help facilitate the further distribution of wealth to the top 1
percent.
Given this possibility, could a Republican victory in the 2016 presidential
election be a good thing for "progressives"? If both the presidency and the
Congress fell under Republican control, life in the U.S. for middle-income,
working-class and poor would get really worse.
But at least no one will have any illusions that
it could be different...
