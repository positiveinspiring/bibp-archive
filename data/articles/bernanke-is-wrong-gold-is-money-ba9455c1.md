# Bernanke is Wrong - Gold is Money

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke today said that
the Federal Reserve is
prepared to act with an additional round of quantitative easing if there is
any weakening of the U.S. economy and threat of deflation.
Bernanke also
said that the Fed could act in other ways to stimulate the economy, such as
cutting the interest rate that the Fed pays to banks on their $1.5 trillion
in excess reserves that they currently keep parked at the Fed. NIA believes
this $1.5 trillion alone would multiply into $15 trillion once it circulates
through the U.S. economy and if Bernanke on top of that unleashes any
additional quantitative easing, it will just about guarantee hyperinflation.
Bernanke has made it very clear that he is prepared to print money until the
U.S. dollar becomes worthless and the incomes and savings of all U.S.
citizens are destroyed.
Ron Paul today asked Bernanke whether or not he watches the price of gold
and if he thinks gold is money. Although Bernanke admitted that he does
watch the price of gold, Bernanke said that gold is not money, but it is
only an asset.
Bernanke explained that central banks only hold gold as a
"tradition". The truth is, gold has been accepted as money throughout all
civilizations over periods of thousands of years.
Bernanke doesn't want U.S.
citizens to wake up and realize that they can opt-out of the criminal
Federal Reserve system if they get rid of their U.S. dollars and store all
of their wealth in gold and silver.
The U.S. Constitution defined gold as legal tender and the current fiat
currency system we have today where Bernanke can steal from the purchasing
power of the poor and middle-class and redistribute this wealth to his
banker friends on Wall Street is unconstitutional, immoral, and illegal.
The
U.S. dollar originally only had purchasing power because it was backed by
gold. Today, the U.S. dollar is a fiat currency that is backed by nothing.
Any remaining purchasing power the U.S. dollar still has is just an illusion
and will soon evaporate due to Bernanke's actions.
In order for an item to function as money, it should be liquid and easily
tradable, easily transportable, and durable. It should be divisible into
smaller units without destroying its value and should also be fungible,
meaning one unit of equal weight must be equivalent to another (which is why
diamonds can't be used as money).
The item must also be a specific weight,
measure, or size, so that it is easy to count. It must be long lasting,
durable, and not perishable or subject to decay (which is why food items
can't be used as money).
Money must be easily recognizable and most importantly, it must be difficult
to counterfeit. The U.S. dollar simply isn't real money because Bernanke has
been counterfeiting trillions of dollars out of thin air. Money shouldn't
require a mark or image to be valuable, but it should just be valuable based
on weight and measure.
Gold is valuable based on its weight and measure, and
fits all of these other qualities and characteristics as well. Never do
people explore shipwrecks hoping to discover U.S. dollars, because dollars
that Bernanke can print at will even if they could survive the corrosion of
the ocean, simply won't have any purchasing power left by the time explorers
can locate them.
People explore shipwrecks for gold, because it will last
underwater for thousands of years and always retain its value.
When Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe ordered their central bank to
implement exactly the same monetary policies that Bernanke has been ordered
to implement here in the U.S., the Zimbabwe dollar became worthless and
Zimbabweans were forced to pan their rivers for gold.
Citizens of Zimbabwe
who were able to find 0.1 gram of gold after a long hard day's work of
shifting through thousands of buckets full of mud, were able to take that
0.1 gram of gold and exchange it for a loaf of bread. Those who were too old
or weak to pan for gold simply couldn't afford food and starved to death.
NIA recommends to all U.S. citizens that they read
this eHow article about
homemade gold panning. This is a
skill all Americans will need to have in order to survive hyperinflation.
Unfortunately, unlike in Zimbabwe, most gold in U.S. rivers has already been
explored for, so Americans might not be as lucky as Zimbabweans.
In order for an asset to be considered money, its supply must be kept
scarce.
Bernanke has spent a total of $4.7 trillion since the
financial
crisis of late-2008, which has flooded the world with excess liquidity of
U.S. dollars and led to massive inflation in the prices of food and energy,
the two items that Americans need most to live and survive. The inflation
problems in China are a direct result of their currency peg to the U.S.
dollar and willingness to accept the dollars we print in return for the real
goods they produce.
As soon as the Chinese central bank decides to end their
currency peg, China's currency will increase in purchasing power and all of
the monetary inflation the U.S. has exported to them will flow back to the
U.S. like a giant tsunami.
Ron Paul today pointed out exactly what we said in our last article. Since
the last Presidential election about three years ago, the U.S. dollar has
lost about half of its purchasing power priced in gold.
Although the U.S.
government's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has reported only 2% annual
price inflation over the past three years, when you account for how the U.S.
government used to calculate price inflation before the implementation of
hedonics and quantitative easing, annual price inflation has actually been
closer to 9%.
Soon when price inflation begins spiraling out of control,
Bernanke will be forced to raise the Fed Funds Rate north of 10%, which will
cause our interest payments on the national debt to soar to over $1 trillion
per year.
The U.S. government will then need to immediately end,
-
Social
Security
-
Medicare
-
Medicaid,
...and all other entitlement programs, to have
any chance of survival.
