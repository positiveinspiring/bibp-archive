The United Nations has officially designated
October 31st as 7 Billion Day.
On that day, the United Nations estimates that
the population of the earth will hit 7 billion for the very first time. But
instead of celebrating what a milestone 7 billion people represents, the
UNPF is focusing instead on using October 31st to raise awareness about "sustainability"
and "sustainable development".
In other words, the United Nations is once again
declaring that there are way too many people on the planet and that we need
to take more direct measures to reduce fertility.
In recent years, the UN
and other international organizations have become bolder about trying to
push
the sick population control agenda of the global elite.
Most of the time organizations such as the UN
will simply talk about "stabilizing" the global population, but as you will
see in this article, there are many among the global elite that are not
afraid to openly talk about a goal of reducing the population of the world
to 500 million (or less).
To you and I it may seem like insanity to want
to get rid of more than 90 percent of the global population, but there is a
growing consensus among the global elite that this is absolutely necessary
for the good of the planet.
As we approach October 31st, dozens of articles
are appearing in newspapers all over the globe that are declaring what a
horrible thing it is that we are up to 7 billion people.
In fact, it surely is no accident that the
United Nations put 7 Billion Day on the exact same day as Halloween. Perhaps
they want to highlight how "scary" it is that we have 7 billion people on
the planet, or perhaps they are trying to send us a message by having 7
Billion Day occur on the same day as "the festival of death".
In any event, it seems like way too much of a
coincidence that 7 Billion Day just happens to fall on the same day as
Halloween.
Today, "sustainable development" has become one
of the key buzzwords that those in the radical environmental movement love
to use, but most Americans have no idea that one of the key elements of
"sustainable development" is population control.
So what precisely is considered to be an ideal
population for the earth by those pushing "sustainable development"?
Well, of course there is much disagreement on
this issue, but many are very open about the fact that they believe that the
earth should only have 500 million people (or less) on it.
For example, the first of the "new 10
commandments"
on the infamous Georgia Guidestones states the following
.
"Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in
perpetual balance with nature."
CNN Founder Ted Turner
would go even farther
.
"A total population of 250-300 million
people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal."
Dave Foreman, the co-founder of Earth First,
says that reducing our population down to 100 million
is one of his three main goals
.
"My three main goals would be to reduce
human population to about 100 million worldwide, destroy the industrial
infrastructure and see wilderness, with its full complement of species,
returning throughout the world."
Sadly, this kind of garbage is even being taught
at major U.S. universities.
For example, Professor of Biology at the
University of Texas at Austin Eric R. Pianka
once wrote the following
.
I do not bear any ill will toward
people. However, I am convinced that the world, including all humanity,
WOULD clearly be much better off without so many of us.
Mikhail Gorbachev thinks that reducing the
global population by 90 percent
would be just about right
.
"We must speak more clearly about
sexuality, contraception, about abortion, about values that control
population, because the ecological crisis, in short, is the population
crisis. Cut the population by 90% and there arent enough people left to
do a great deal of ecological damage."
But most of the time, the way that the global
elite speak of population control is much more "politically correct".
They
tend to use terms such as "sustainable development" and "reduction of
fertility rates" and "quality of life" when discussing the need to reduce
our population.
As 7 Billion Day has approached, there have been
articles popping up in major publications all over the globe that are
advocating increased population control measures. Of course in the western
world such measures are always framed as being "voluntary", but that is the
way that they always introduce things like this.
Once enough people get on
board with the "voluntary" population control measures they will become
"mandatory".
So now that you are aware of some of the
buzzwords that are used, check out what has been written on some of the
biggest news websites in the world recently
.
Jeffrey D. Sachs, the director of The Earth
Institute at Columbia University, recently said the following
in an article for CNN
.
"The arrival
of the 7 billionth person is cause for profound global concern.
It
carries a challenge:
What will it take to maintain a planet in which
each person has a chance for a full, productive and prosperous life, and
in which the planets resources are sustained for future generations? How, in
short, can we enjoy sustainable development on a very crowded planet?"
For Sachs, one of the "keys" to sustainable
development is the "stabilization" of the global population
.
"The second
key to sustainable development is the stabilization of the global
population. This is already occurring in high-income and even some
middle-income countries, as families choose to have one or two children
on average.
The reduction of fertility rates should be encouraged in the
poorer countries as well."
In a recent article
for the Guardian, Roger Martin stated that all of the problems that
humanity is facing would be easier to solve if less people were running
around the planet
"
all
environmental (and many economic and social) problems are easier to
solve with fewer people, and ultimately impossible with ever more."
He also says that if we reduce the population,
it will mean better lives for all the rest of us
.
"On a finite
planet, the optimum population providing the best quality of life for
all, is clearly much smaller than the maximum, permitting bare survival.
The more we are, the less for each; fewer people mean better lives."
But is that really the case? Of course not.
There has been tremendous human suffering all
throughout history. If we eliminated 90 percent of the global population it
would not suddenly usher in some kind of "golden age".
But many among the global elite are truly
convinced that we are spoiling "their planet" and they dont want so many of
us around anymore. Thanks to technology, they only need a few hundred
million people to run their system, and they view the rest of us as "useless
eaters".
This all may sound quite bizarre to many of you,
but this is the kind of stuff that is being taught in colleges and
universities across the western world.
In fact, you are starting to see an increasing
number of people in the western world actually suggest that we adopt a
"one-child policy" such as China has.
For example, the following is from an opinion
piece that appeared
in the National Post
.
A planetary
law, such as Chinas one-child policy, is the only way to reverse the
disastrous global birthrate currently, which is one million births every
four days.
The author of the opinion piece believes that
such a "one-child policy" would reduce the global population to 3.43 billion
by 2075
The
intelligence behind this is the following:
-
If only
one child per female was born as of now, the worlds population
would drop from its current 6.5 billion to 5.5 billion by 2050,
according to a study done for scientific academy Vienna Institute of
Demography.
-
By 2075,
there would be 3.43 billion humans on the planet. This would have
immediate positive effects on the worlds forests, other species,
the oceans, atmospheric quality and living standards.
This is the kind of stuff that a lot of these
people sit around and think about all day long.
They are obsessed with death and with reducing
the population as rapidly as possible. They see us as a "plague" that is
ravaging the planet, and they believe that by getting rid of us they would
actually be saving the earth.
Due to public opinion, population control
advocates have to tread lightly in the western world. But where they can get
away with it, they are not afraid to be very forceful.
I have already discussed the horrific one-child
policy in China.
As
the Epoch Times recently noted, enforcement of this policy can be
absolutely brutal
.
"Pregnant
women lacking birth permits are hunted down like criminals by population
planning police in China and forcibly aborted."
If you dont believe something like this can
ever happen in the western world, you might want to think again.
Limitations on child births are already showing
up in popular television shows.
For example, a new show on Fox called Terra
Nova portrays the future of the earth as a living hell due to
overpopulation. People in the future can hardly breathe the air due to
overwhelming pollution and a strict "two-child policy" is rigidly enforced.
The family featured in Terra Nova is able to go
through a portal to a prehistoric world that is 85 million years in the
past. In this "new world", humans have set up a wonderful new socialist
society where everyone is provided for and where "green technology" is
helping them to avoid making the "mistakes" of the past.
Unfortunately, socialist utopias such as the one
portrayed on Terra Nova only exist in works of fiction. Instead, what happens most of the time in real
life is that the "good intentions" of social planners devolve into absolute
tyranny when put into practice.
For example, just check out what
a recent National Geographic article said happened when social planners
in India tried to aggressively reduce birth rates in India in the 1970s
The Indian
government tried once before to push vasectomies, in the 1970s, when
anxiety about the population bomb was at its height.
Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay used state-of-emergency powers
to force a dramatic increase in sterilizations. From 1976 to 1977 the
number of operations tripled, to more than eight million.
Over six
million of those were vasectomies. Family planning workers were
pressured to meet quotas; in a few states, sterilization became a
condition for receiving new housing or other government benefits.
In some cases
the police simply rounded up poor people and hauled them to
sterilization camps.
How would you feel if you were rounded up and
hauled off to a sterilization camp?
Sterilization programs (most of the time they
are "voluntary") are in full force all over the globe. Much of the time they
are sponsored and funded by the United Nations. The global elite are
absolutely obsessed with getting women to have less babies.
That is one reason why abortion is so very
important to them.
Recently,
Al Gore made the
following statement regarding population control
"One of the
things we could do about it is to change the technologies, to put out
less of this pollution, to stabilize the population, and one of the
principle ways of doing that is to empower and educate girls and women.
You have to have ubiquitous availability of fertility management so
women can choose how many children have, the spacing of the children.
The elite love to use terms such as "fertility
management" and "family planning", but what they really intend is for there
to be less pregnancies and more abortions so that the population will not
grow as quickly.
They certainly do not intend to empower women to
have more children.
This agenda was also very much reflected when
the March 2009 U.N. Population Division policy brief asked this shocking
question
.
"What would
it take to accelerate fertility decline in the least developed
countries?"
Now who in the world gave the UN the right to be
trying to "accelerate fertility decline" for women in poor countries?
But to many in the global elite, trying to get
women to have less babies makes all the sense in the world. In a recent
editorial for the New York Times entitled "The
Earth Is Full", Thomas L. Friedman made the following statement
.
You really do
have to wonder whether a few years from now well look back at the first
decade of the 21st century - when food prices spiked, energy prices
soared, world population surged, tornados plowed through cities, floods
and droughts set records, populations were displaced and governments
were threatened by the confluence of it all - and ask ourselves:
What were
we thinking? How did we not panic when the evidence was so obvious
that wed crossed some growth/climate/natural resource/population
redlines all at once?
These people honestly and truly believe this
stuff.
Unfortunately, this agenda is even represented
in the highest levels of our own government.
Barack Obamas top science advisor,
John P. Holdren, once wrote the following
"A program of
sterilizing women after their second or third child, despite the
relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy, might be
easier to implement than trying to sterilize men.
The
development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted
under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional
possibilities for coercive fertility control.
The capsule could be
implanted at puberty and might be removable, with official permission,
for a limited number of births."
Holdren also believes that compulsory abortion
would be perfectly legal under the U.S. Constitution
.
"Indeed, it
has been concluded that compulsory population-control laws, even
including laws requiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under
the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently
severe to endanger the society."
The following are 8 more quotes that show the
mindset that a lot of these population control advocates have
.
"The
world today has 6.8 billion people. Thats heading up to about
nine billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines,
health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that
by perhaps 10 or 15 percent."
"Frankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there
was concern about population growth and particularly growth in
populations that we dont want to have too many of."
"The
negative impact of population growth on all of our planetary
ecosystems is becoming appallingly evident."
"In
order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350,000
people per day."
"If I
were reincarnated I would wish to be returned to earth as a
killer virus to lower human population levels."
"Childbearing [should be] a punishable crime against society,
unless the parents hold a government license
All potential
parents [should be] required to use contraceptive chemicals, the
government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for
childbearing."
"The
most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant
members is to kill it."

Birth Control. New York: New York Publishing Company, 1922. Page 12
(or read 'The
Morality of Birth Control')
"Birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race."
When you believe that the earth has way too many
people, human life becomes cheap, and abortion becomes a way to get rid of
undesirables.
According to a recent article
in the Daily Mail, thousands of "abnormal" babies are now being
selectively aborted in the UK each year
.
Thousands of
pregnancies were aborted last year for abnormalities including 500 for
Downs syndrome, new figures reveal. In total,
there were 2,290 abortions for medical problems with the fetus, with 147
performed after 24 weeks.
In a world that is "overpopulated", babies that
are not "perfect" become more "disposable" than ever.
In fact, the truth is that the population
control agenda and the "abortion rights movement" have been inseparably
linked for decades. Those that are obsessed with "overpopulation" view
abortion as a very necessary method of birth control, and one of their main
goals is to expand access to "reproductive health care" to as many women
around the globe as possible.
But in the end, our "voluntary" actions are not
going to be nearly enough to reduce the population and most population
control advocates realize that. Many of them are openly calling for a
"benevolent" global authority to take charge to lead us through the
"necessary" transition that is ahead.
In
'Al
Gore, Agenda 21 And Population Control', I described the type of world that the radical
population control advocates see for our future
Imagine going
to sleep one night and waking up many years later in a totally different
world.
In this
futuristic world, literally everything you do is tightly monitored and
controlled by control freak bureaucrats in the name of "sustainable
development" and with the goal of promoting 'the green agenda'.
An
international ruling body has centralized global control over all human
activity. What you eat, what you drink, where you live, how warm or cold
your home can be and how much fuel you can use is determined by them.
Anyone that
dissents or that tries to rebel against the system is sent off for
're-education'.
The human population is 90 percent lower than it is
today in this futuristic society, and all remaining humans have been
herded into tightly constricted cities which are run much like prisons.
This is the endgame for the radical green
agenda. In order to save the earth, they feel as though they must
dramatically reduce our numbers and very tightly control our activities.
Personally, I think that the 7 billion people on
earth would do just fine if they were given a lot more liberty and freedom
to live their own lives as they see fit. But letting people decide how to run their own
lives is anathema to those that have bought into the population control
agenda of the global elite.
They actually believe that they are smarter than
all of the rest of us and that they need to tell us what to do for the good
of humanity and for the good of the planet.
