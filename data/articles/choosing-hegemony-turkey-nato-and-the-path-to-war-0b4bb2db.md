As the
destabilization of Syria
has evolved over the course of the last year and a half,
what has become apparent to political observers is the
seeming incongruity of Turkeys role in the region.
While Ankara has attempted in
recent years to establish itself as a force for political
and economic change and progress, it has also assumed the
role of a NATO attack dog, becoming a crucial weapon in the
arsenal of the Western imperialists.
While Turkeys actions in Syria,
in particular the
sponsorship and coordination of
terrorists, must be vigorously condemned, it is
also important to note the geopolitical and economic issues
at stake for Turkey.
In doing so, those of us around
the world who reject imperialist meddling and
destabilization, who stand in opposition to Western hegemony
and proxy states, must help push Turkey back onto the path
of peace and progress.
Turkeys Role in Syria
Anyone who has followed the evolution of the imperialist aggression against
Syria has undoubtedly noted the insidious role that Turkey has played.
From a diplomatic perspective, Ankara has led
the charge in
demonizing the Assad regime, saying that it
stands against the will of the Syrian people and is killing its own
people. However, the reality is that Turkey, along with its collaborators
in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Lebanon and elsewhere, have done more to fan the
flames of violence and instability than the Assad regime ever could.
First and foremost, one must examine the overt sponsorship and hosting of
international terrorists on Turkish soil.
As
Reuters and other news outlets reported last week,
Turkey has been operating a terrorist base in Adana, in the vicinity of
US-NATOs base at
Incirlik. It is from this base (and others,
to be sure) that many of the terrorists have been funneled into Syria.
Moreover, these terrorists are not strictly Syrians trying to destabilize
their own country.
In fact, the majority of those operating from
the Turkish base are from,
...and elsewhere.
Essentially then, it is clear that, at the
behest of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, under the command and control of the
Turkish military and intelligence apparatus, the destabilization of Syria
has been led.
So, it would be fair to say that Turkey has been
at the forefront of the attack on its neighbor, acting as a willing
partner of NATO, complicit in countless horrendous war crimes perpetrated
against the people of Syria.
Hosting and operating terror networks is not the only way in which Ankara
has played an instrumental role in exacerbating the conflict.
In an article entitled War
at Any Cost - Another Manufactured Pretext for War with Syria, I
analyzed the way in which the Erdogan government attempted to use the
downing of one of its jets as a legitimization of war against its neighbor.
In the ensuing weeks, and after careful
investigation, it has become clear that, at the very least, the Turkish jet
had violated Syrian airspace and that the military acted within the confines
of international law in their response. It was the rhetoric of Erdogan,
Davotoglu and others that was more instructive however.
In the aftermath of this event,
Erdogan threatened military action against Syria,
claiming that the military might pose a threat.
Of course, this should be taken to mean that
Turkey would have taken upon itself the right to interpret the military of a
sovereign state acting within its own borders as a threat, a clear violation
of the principles of international relations and law. Essentially, the
entire episode with the downing of the jet demonstrated the fact that
Erdogan and Co. were willing to allow themselves to be used as NATOs dagger
against Assad.
One integral element of the destabilization campaign has been the use of
foreign diplomatic entities, primarily the so-called Syrian National
Council to act as the ostensible voice of the opposition, while in fact
being the mouthpiece of US-NATO.
The SNC, led by foundation-funded Western
proxies such as
Bassma Kodmani, advocates regime change
in Syria and supports the loose collection of terror groups and death squads
operating under the moniker of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). The Council has
been hosted by Turkey, receiving financial and diplomatic support from
Ankara.
This dubious entity has failed to unite the
opposition, its one US-NATO delegated task, and has instead become a
lightning rod for criticism from much of the international community. It has
become clear in recent months that the SNC is, in fact, composed of a number
of factions including
the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been
implicated in weapons smuggling along the
Syria-Turkey border in tandem with the CIA.
In addition, the SNC and their Turkish hosts
have attempted to foment chaos in Syria using discontented Kurdish elements,
many of whom view the SNC and the dismantling of the Syrian state as a
prelude to Kurdish independence.
Essentially, the Syrian National Council (and,
to a lesser degree, the Free Syrian Army) could not exist were it not for
overt support, both financial and diplomatic, of the Turkish government.
What the Turkish government has called support for the Syrian people has,
in fact, become support for international terror networks.
It is now public knowledge that Al Qaeda is
operating on Turkish soil near the Syrian border, using Turkey as a safe
haven and command center from which to launch incursions into Syria.
As Tony Cartalucci
points out however, this trend is nothing
new.
Cartalucci points to the famous New Yorker
article by Seymour Hersh entitled The
Redirection, in which Hersh states:
"To undermine Iran, which is predominantly
Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure
its priorities in the Middle East.
In Lebanon, the Administration has
cooperated with Saudi Arabias government, which is Sunni, in
clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite
organization that is backed by Iran.
The U.S. has also taken part in clandestine
operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria. A by-product of these
activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that
espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and
sympathetic to Al Qaeda."
Here we see the complicity of the United States
and its proxies in the region in organizing and unleashing Al Qaeda as a
weapon against its enemies.
Turkey has merely allowed itself to be made into
a staging ground for this type of destabilization, precisely what the Assad
regime has argued since the beginning of the conflict.
Aside from Al Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood and
other
terror networks have been mobilized in Turkey
in order to smash the Syrian state.
The attempt was to topple the Assad regime and
put, in its place, a government more amenable to US designs for a new Arab
World, one that would be subservient to Western imperialism for another half
century. What has taken place however, has been quite the opposite.
Instead of destroying Syria and the regime in
Damascus, it is the terrorists and their handlers in Ankara, Riyadh, and
Washington who have had to backpedal as Damascus has executed a successful
counter-terrorism strategy and maintained control of the country.
Geopolitics and
Rationalizing the Subversion
Many times since the destabilization of Syria began, keen political
observers have wondered what Turkey hopes to gain from fomenting chaos over
the border.
In addressing this perplexing question, one
begins to gain insight into more than Turkeys reasons for doing so; one
begins to explore the Turkish mindset. For years, Turkey has maintained a
Zero Problems policy with its neighbors, essentially preferring to have
relations with all regional players, from Israel to Syria and Iran.
However, as the NY Times
points out, this strategy has changed in
recent years, particularly under the leadership of Erdogan and current
Foreign Minister Davutoglu. With them at the helm, Turkey has instead
chosen to allow itself to become NATOs enforcer, doing the dirty work of
imperialism including diplomatic attacks, terrorism, and countless other
equally horrendous forms of subversion.
In doing so, the ruling establishment in Ankara
has bought into NATOs insidious tenets of hegemony and domination. The
Turkish government seems to have succumbed to a form of hubris or, as some
might argue, the hysteria of power.
Erdogan, Davutoglu and others have chosen to try
to make Turkey into a regional hegemon capable of dominating its
neighbors economically, politically, and militarily.
However, what they seem to have failed to
realize is that Turkey itself is a fragile state, created less than a
century ago and comprised of a number of ethnic groups at odds with each
other.
As author and historian Webster Tarpley
has
pointed out,
Turkey has been bought off by the
Anglo-American elite and created a situation where the risk and possible
rewards are entirely out of proportion.
Indeed, it would seem that the ruling
establishment in Ankara has made the proverbial deal with the devil,
eschewing the rational and sound zero problems policy in favor of an
endless problems policy espoused by NATO and its masters on Wall St. and
in London.
Playing a Dangerous
Game
Turkey is risking quite a lot in attempting to destroy the Assad regime and,
with it, the Syrian state.
First and foremost is the immediate blowback
from the destruction of its neighbor. Undoubtedly, the Kurdish minority in
Turkey, which makes up more than a quarter of the total population, will
then become more difficult to manage, uniting with their Syrian cousins and
beginning to cause unrest inside Turkey which has, for decades, been
fighting a perpetual separatist movement in the Kurdish areas.
The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)
has been engaged in terrorist activities in Turkey for years and, with the
destruction of Syria, would likely emerge as a much more immediate threat to
the safety and security of Turkey.
Essentially then, Turkeys destabilization of
Syria would, quite predictably, grow to destabilize Turkey itself.
Secondly, Turkey risks very lucrative and long-standing economic ties with
Russia and China. Because of their belligerent position vis-à-vis Syria,
Turkey might jeopardize precisely those relations which stand to benefit its
economy and people most.
With regard to Russia, Turkey has important
development deals that must be understood. Most prominent among these is the
proposed Mersin Akkuyu nuclear power deal
signed by Moscow and Ankara worth upwards
of $20 billion. This represents the largest single Russian investment
anywhere outside of the Russian Federation.
Moreover, this deal would move Turkey forward in
the fields of energy production and high technology, both of which are
crucial for the maintenance and building of an advanced economy in the 21st
Century.
Likewise, the
South Stream Pipeline, long seen as
integral to the economic futures of both Russia and Turkey, could be in
jeopardy. Additionally, the establishment of the High Level Cooperation
Council (UDIK) under Medvedev sought to bring together the diplomatic
and political leadership of the two countries to
jointly work toward building a common
economic destiny.
This could be the beginning of tremendous
economic and geopolitical progress for Russia and Turkey, progress which is
likely to be stymied by Ankaras incomprehensible folly in Syria.
Lastly, Turkey continues to look towards membership in the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO), dominated by Russia and China. Because
of the economic crisis in Europe and cloudy future of the EU more generally,
Turkey has put the brakes on possible full integration with Europe and,
instead, chosen to focus on the SCO.
Just this week, Erdogan explained that his
country is looking more and more to integration into the SCO instead of the
EU. Naturally, Moscow and Beijing will not allow a NATO attack dog state
into the SCO and so, as with many other issues, Turkey risks their
opportunity to integrate themselves into the developing world of the BRICS
and SCO solely because theyve allowed themselves to be hoodwinked by
US-NATO.
Turkey would do well to look at its own past to find the wisdom that will
light the path back to a sound foreign policy, back to progress and reason.
Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey
once said,
Unless a nations life faces peril, war is
murder.
The truth and meaning of this statement must not
be underestimated.
In fact, Turkey had to learn the hard way that
the path to progress is fraught with challenges; that notions of empire and
hegemony must be shed in order to better the lives of the people.
In this case, we must think not only of the
lives of Turkish people, but of Syrians as well and, for that matter, all
people of the world. In so doing, it is important to remember that no
good can come to Turkey or the region if they continue down the path of
subversion, terrorism, and destruction in Syria.
As Ataturk famously said,
Peace at home, peace in the world.
Hopefully, these words are not entirely
forgotten in Turkey today.
