This week Congress votes on President Obamas
proposed $3.6 trillion budget plan for fiscal 2010.
Obama plans to lobby both the Houses of
Representatives which votes today and the Senate which votes later in the
week. Republican opposition is mounting with a report released last Friday
by the Congressional Budget Office saying that Obamas budget revenue
projections are too optimistic and may
increase the deficit by 9.3 trillion over
the next decade.
Only deep spending and tax cuts make Obamas
budget realistic, according to
Republican critics. On the other side of
the political divide, Democrats are saying
corporate bailout funds and tax cuts need
to be sacrificed to balance the federal budget. Only then can essential
social services such as education, health and transportation be provided in
a responsible manner.
There is a third way to scale back the federal
deficit while maintaining essential services at responsible levels.
President Obama can expose Americas second
black budget so that corruption and inefficiencies in executive agencies
and departments can be permanently removed.

The official black budget comprises single
line items in the Department of Defense (DoD) budget that
dont refer to any real weapons system.
These single line items are covers
for a Congressionally sanctioned and publicly funded black budget a top
secret slush fund for intelligence organizations such as the CIA, and
classified weapons programs by the DoD.
There is, however, a second black budget that is
not congressionally sanctioned, but it is nevertheless publicly funded
Americas unofficial black budget.
The conventional political view is that covert operations are funded by
Congressional appropriations authorizing the DoD to use U.S. Treasury funds
for classified projects and intelligence activities that appear as vague
single line items on the DoD budget. Subtracting the cost of known weapons
systems and intelligence programs from the total DoD budget gives
Congressional analysts a means of estimating the size and scope of
operations of the covert world of black projects, without knowing their
precise budgets or activities.
There is however compelling evidence that the
covert world of highly classified projects is primarily funded by a black
budget created by the CIA rather than the DoD. Rather than being a
beneficiary of a Congressionally sanctioned DoD black budget, the CIA has
its own unofficial black budget. The CIAs black budget is a conduit for
funds secretly siphoned into the various military intelligence agencies and
private contractors associated with both the CIA and the DoD, for
intelligence activities, covert operations, and weapons research and
development.
The CIA has the unique legal ability among all U.S. government departments
and agencies to generate funds through appropriations of other federal
government agencies and other sources without
regard to any provisions of law, and without regard to the
intent behind Congressional appropriations.
Every year, according to
Catherine Austin Fitts, a former
Assistant Secretary of HUD (United States Department of Housing
and Urban Development), billions of dollars of Congressional
appropriations are diverted from their Congressionally sanctioned purposes
to CIA and DoD based intelligence agencies without knowledge of the public
and with the collusion of Congressional leaders.
The covert world of black programs acts with
virtual impunity, overseen and regulated by itself, funding itself through
secret slush funds, and is free of the limitations that come from
Congressional oversight, proper auditing procedures and public scrutiny.
The key to uncovering the true size of the black budget is the chronic
accounting anomalies in the DoD budget. These anomalies reveal over one
trillion U.S. dollars annually is being siphoned by the CIA into the DoD for
secret distribution to various military intelligence agencies and corporate
contractors, and the deep black programs they support.
Such siphoning, with dubious constitutional
status, is made legal by various Congressional enactments, senior
Congressional officials, and the Executive Office.
The size of the Black Budget, the secrecy
surrounding it, the extent senior Federal officials and agencies go to in
targeting individuals and companies threatening to reveal where
Congressional appropriations are ultimately going, point to a vast network
of deep black projects.
This network collectively forms a highly
classified second Manhattan Project whose existence, goals and budget are
kept secret.
My new book,
Exposing U.S. Government Policies on Extraterrestrial
Life reveals this new Manhattan Project is a network of
projects in the U.S. and around the world dealing with
extraterrestrial life
and
technology.
As President Obama tries to balance the federal budget and deal with critics
concerning increasing federal deficits, he may pause to consider evidence of
a second black budget. If this unofficial black budget is exposed, then the
government corruption and auditing anomalies which create it can end.
Only then can U.S. government agencies and
departments truly balance their budgets, and provide the public with
responsible social services that public tax dollars more than amply cover.
Exposing Americas second black budget is no longer just a moral imperative,
but is now an economic necessity.
President Obama needs to deal decisively with
his second black budget problem so that his 2010 and future budget proposals
are financially viable.
