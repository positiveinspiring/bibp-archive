PERGAMUM AND PITANE
Aristotle, author of some lucid thinking on the subject of money, if not
ruthlessly penetrative, was himself married to the niece of a banker
installed as co-tyrant (or "Front Man") with another such tyrant-banker...
"(Hermias the Tyrant of Assos and Atarneus) was a eunuch slave of a certain
banker: he went to Athens and attended the lectures of Plato and Aristotle,
and returning, he shared the tyranny of his master who had previously
secured the places around Atarneus and Assos. Subsequently he succeeded him
and sent for Aristotle and married his niece to him... (1)
...In this slave, banker, philosopher and despot Leaf (2) sees a tyrant who
owed his position to his wealth. He quotes Euaion, the pupil of Plato, who,
not far to the North at Lampsacus 'lent money to the city on security of the
Acropolis, and when the city defaulted, wanted to become a tyrant'..."
(3)
While bankers in the present dream of entrapping the whole world via their
"United Nations", in the past they contented themselves with the entrapping
of a city! ...
Just as in the present they create an entirely false picture
of the nature of their operations and carefully promote the legend they are
lending the public's money, so they did in antiquity, we may rest assured.
No doubt they spread exactly the same story in the time of the tyrants, and
people in that day, understanding no more about money than they do today,
believed it (4) ...
The following may be accepted as instance of their
activities in ancient times.
...Pergamum, that city that arose in South West Asia Minor, lasting as
independent from 283-133 B.C., was originally founded as the fortified
treasury of Lysimachus, successor to Alexander in Thrace. This fort and the
treasure therein amounting to 9000 talents, was in the charge of a eunuch
steward named Philetairos who justified the trust reposed in him in so far
as the management of this treasure was concerned.
During the quarrels of the Diadochoi or
Successors to Alexander, presumably at the strategic moment, he
transferred his allegiance from Lysimachus to Seleucus, doubtless on
condition he be guaranteed his continued position as Master of the Treasury.
Despite the murder of Seleucus by Ptolemy Keraunus, the wily Philetairos
clung to the fortunes of the Seleucids, probably understanding in their
particular case, the political purposes of the International Money Power of
Babylonia and Alexandria in these respects, and ingratiated himself with
Antiochus, son of Seleucus, by buying the body of Seleucus from Ptolemy for
return to Antiochus, (5) thus, through it all maintaining his position at
Pergamum...
Philetairos proceeded to use the treasure to which he had so masterfully
established almost total right, with a skill which could only suggest
training in the money shops of Babylonia, or Alexandria, or as close
advisor, one so trained.
The conception of the 9000 talents of treasure in
itself being the sole maintaining force behind the extended power of
Pergamum, would be quaint to say the least; as quaint indeed as the story of
the 6000 talents of silver held in reserve in the Acropolis at Athens as the
sole finances with which the Peloponnesian war was fought; or in a later day
of the gold supposedly existing in the vaults of the Bank of England or its
predecessor, and its parent bank, the Bank of Amsterdam (the vaults of the
latter on inspection by Napoleon (6) after occupation of Holland, proving
absolutely bare!).
9000 talents drawn on for military and civilian
expenditures, extensive bribes, etc., would not go very far.
Returning again to Professor Andreades, in his Finances De Guerre d'alexandre le grand,
(7) the annual expenditures of Alexander during the
earlier years of his campaigning were 5000-7000 talents, which would, in the
first year or two, certainly until the battle of Issus (Oct. 333 B.C.), have
been in hard cash for the most part, to use the terminology of today's
banker; that is, coined money or silver bullion, or the gold bullion of
which the mines at Phillipi had made steady yield. In the later years of
campaigning, Andreades estimated the annual expenditures of Alexander at
15,000 talents...
If the money for this expenditure derived from coined
precious metal plunder, it would go even less far, for in newly occupied
territories, the exploitation of the miseries of the people usual to these
circumstances would exist, and there would be a collapse of "Credit" or
abstract money, until reorganization set in. there would be total
disturbance of the revenues deriving from taxes. silver, particularly, would
either move eastward against luxury trading, which seems to continue as much
as ever in such times, or would disappear into hoards.
During the first Millennium B.C., the ratio of silver to gold never went
below 10:1, being usually 13:1 in Europe and the so-called Middle East. In
farther Bactria, India and China, it was rarely more than 6:1 and in some
parts as low as 1:1. (8)
Therefore, once precious metal coinage was spent,
particularly silver coinage, and passed into the hands of merchants,
contractors, etc., finally returning to the bankers or money changers, with
that field for assured profit by settlement of oriental trade balances with
coined silver or silver bullion such as clearly existed, as according to
Gresham's law, (9) its local circulating volume might be assumed to decrease
rapidly, and without a doubt did so decrease.
It might safely be said that the money power which enabled Pergamum to
secure controlling interest over the cities of Pitane and Cyzicus, (10) was
not drawn from what might be left of that store of 9000 talents (the loan in
the case of Pitane, probably a very minor transaction, was sufficient to
substantially ease the burden of a debt of 380 talents) ...
It would have
been part of a credit inflation which would have used the 9000 talents, or
the legend in respect thereto, as its base, and more than likely those
interests holding the debt of the city of Pitane were themselves indebted by
another ledger entry transaction to Pergamum. Thus that "Credit Money"
transaction whereby Pitane was loaned money would be no more than an entry
in the books of Pergamum as a credit to Pitane, automatically being thence
debited and transferred to the credit column of the holder of the loan as
previously existing against Pitane, and thus returning him to solvency.
In other words, Pergamum, at cost of pen, ink, vellum, (11) and slave scribe
or perhaps (and more likely) cost of clay tablet and stylus book entry, was
now in a position to dictate the political affairs of Pitane.
Perhaps the
agent for the Babylonian bankers or their Alexandrian counterparts, as the
previous holder of the Pitane loan may have been, consequently recovered his
liquid position so far as Pergamum was concerned, and was now able to look
around again for more profitable investments.
The extent of the semi-military operations of the Attalid Money Power of
Pergamum was shown above all by their purchase of the island of Aegina for
thirty talents. (12) This island they most likely set up as a centre for entre-p√¥t trade and a financial outpost, i.e., "Branch Bank": which had to
be in opposition to the decaying Athenian money power which at that time did
not have the silver resources of its earlier days on which to base its money
power, and the legend of its great wealth.
The Laurion mines were petering out, and those markets in South Russia, (13)
Thrace, etc., formerly supplied by Athenian manufactured products, were fast
failing at the time of Pergamum and the Attalids; having set up their own
local manufacturies. Athens, no longer centre of an Empire, neither
military, or financial power, with fewer markets ready to settle debit trade
balances with those slaves so much required for silver mining, as had been
South Russia, was likely just a pleasant place to live in; the storms brewed
by settlement of International Money Power as in days gone by, passed over.
As Pergamum marks the beginning of that period when Delos and Rhodes were
leading money and slave markets of the world, it would seem that some kind
of agreement must have existed between those who controlled trade and
finance at all these points.
Considering the essential secrecy that
necessarily attends the corrupt operations of so-called bankers, it may be
quite reasonable to suppose, that in Pergamum itself, in Aegina, Delos,
Rhodes and for that matter, a dozen other trade centres, there was a class
of persons who very well understood each other's interests, who very likely
were related by racial and religious custom, and whose supra-nationalism
transcended all city boundaries and borders of states.
Money was their trade, and they married only amongst their own group as the
best protection towards maintaining inviolable the secret of that financial
hegemony they had established internationally, and which in a way had put
them above kingship; no doubt in the fevered imagination of some of them,
one with the gods.
Through the illusion of the establishment of silver as
the standard of value internationally or nationally, and whose supply they
totally controlled, it is true, they actually did wield that power which
formerly had been the sole prerogative of the gods in the cities of ancient Sumeria, through their sons upon earth, the Priest-Kings; even if only as
the venal and self-interested men that they were.
The activities of this group towards the instigation of wars, and
disturbances never ceased. Out of the needs of peoples in despair came their
advantage and strengthened control; and because they controlled the fiscal
affairs of the temples, whose very existence became completely intertwined
with their activities, (14) it may safely be said that they controlled the
oracular pronouncements which so often could decide yea or nay to war... Out
of rumour generally they guided the moods of the peoples...
Such wars were
necessary, as much as today, towards the maintenance of their great arms
industry and their continued control through the sale of the best and newest
of weapons to that new "conqueror" who promised most of all to serve their
purposes in the renewal of their stocks of treasure, so necessary to
maintain "confidence", and their stocks of mine slaves. war also revived
that feverish and competitive demand for that treasure; and in the
hurly-burly it created, merchants gladly accepted as money anything offered
from seemingly reputable sources including that abstract money denoted by
ledger credit page entry; the loan of which but cost the lender the entry by
slave scribe on the clay tablet, though immense real wealth might be offered
as "collateral" as against failure to repay such alleged loan by the date
stipulated.
The far-flung activities of Apollonius, economic manager to Ptolemy Philadelphus, as recorded by Professor
Rostovtsev, (15) give but a glimpse
of this interlocking control by an Aramaic speaking middle class, within
which the Hebrew may also have been an interwoven thread...
Perhaps the
weft, although not the weft and the warp...
For indeed there is no evidence that he was all, and that such magnates that
controlled the economy of the ancient world were many of them Jews.
Nevertheless the claim by the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (16) that the
Hebrews, as a people who absorbed foreign cultures, yet rigidly maintain
their national identity caused them to be most appreciated by the brilliant
and ambitious Alexander, should not be lightly dismissed. Alexander was
trainee of Aristotle, who, as husband of the niece of Hermias, Banker-Tyrant
of Assos and Atameus, certainly should have come to learn something of the
true meaning of Money Power.
Alexander therefore, presumably had substantial
understanding of the meaning of money relative to Kingship...
The Hebrew, as equally skilled in money and trade as the Aramean and equally
fluent in Aramaic, since he was established in most of the important cities
of the ancient world, from the Pillars of Hercules to India in which
Aramaic, certainly existed as lingua franca, at least in those cities
between India and the Levant, could very well have been a major part of that
vehicle constructed by Alexander to spread his dream of Pan-Hellenism.
His
special concessions to Jaddua, High Priest in Jerusalem in 333 B.C. in
respect to those Jews of both Judea and Babylon, and also in respect to the
foundation of Alexandria, (17) certainly suggest deference to a power far
beyond that power visibly represented by that relatively small group of
people who dwelt at Jerusalem and on the highlands by which it was
surrounded...
According to the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia:
during the
siege of Tyre by Alexander, Jaddua, High Priest of Jerusalem, not wishing to
offend Persia and Darius, had refused Alexander the troops and provisions he
sought (18) ...
After the fall of Tyre, Alexander advanced on Jerusalem,
ancient ally of Tyre as the assistance of Hiram, King of Tyre towards the
building of the Temple of Solomon will call to mind; (19) undoubtedly with
the intention of reducing that city should no satisfactory settlement be
reached.
As Alexander neared the Temple, so the story goes, the High Priest clothed
in full vestments of gold and purple, and the Priests in their sacerdotal
robes, and a great multitude dressed in white, went out to meet him, the
decision having no doubt been arrived at that discretion was the better part
of valor. Alexander, seeing the High Priest and his mitre on which was
written the Name of God, reverenced the Name and saluted the High Priest. He
said he had seen a figure such as the High Priest in a dream, who had told
him he would give him Lordship over the Persian Hosts.
Then Alexander entered the city, and, as was his usual custom with
submissive cities, he sacrificed to their God...
The fact that he gave the Jews of Palestine such special concessions as a
years remission of taxes which was also extended to the Jews of Babylonia,
and specially invited any Jew to settle in his city of Alexandria, would
suggest that the visible help refused him by Jaddua had been more than made
up for by assistance of a less visible nature such as, it might reasonably
be expected, had helped to secure the fall of Babylon, to Cyrus, ancestor of
Darius, and founder of the Achaemenid Dynasty of Persia (20) ...
The stress on the Aramaic speaking middle class of all those "Empires" from
the Assyrian, until the successors to Alexander, and perhaps beyond, is more
than justified in view of the results of the studies of various scholars.
If Aramaic was the language of officialdom under the
Achaemenid rulers of the
Persian empire, and remained so under Alexander and the successors, it may
reasonably be supposed that the official and merchant classes that used
Aramaic as their everyday language, had gone far beyond the borders of the
Persian empire, both to the east and to the west. as has been previously
pointed out, with that Aramaic interstratum moved also to the east and west,
the agents of that money power centered in Mesopotamia, heir to the secrets,
not only of the Sumerian priesthood, but of the priesthood of much more
ancient times, selling as they went along the idea of the use of precious
metal money.
No sooner had short sighted rulers instituted the use of precious metal
money, than the agents of such money power, to whom by now the ruler was
beholden for supplies of bullion, were setting up "modern" banking houses.
in short order the various practices of dubious legality that are the
foundations of such money power would be instituted.
Firstly that of the
creation, relatively without limit, of abstract units of exchange as through
the institution of ledger credit page entry money, under whatever cover to
create legality, and which the banker claimed was backed by his
"Credit"! - (As if he could have more "Credit" than any sovereign people and
their ruler!) - and which was usually backed in final analysis by little or
nothing other than the sanction of a foolish prince.
Secondly, from the
point of view of maintenance of "confidence" so far as lesser trade was
concerned, was the issue of intrinsically valueless facsimiles of existing
precious metal coinage, for every one of which a customer who accepted them
in the exchanges, thought that there was a precious metal original lodged in
the local temple or acropolis.
To our Lord Jesus Christ, Aramaic was the everyday language that would have
enabled Him to travel, and converse freely with scholar, poet, priest, and
merchant, certainly as far East as Peshawar. Aramaic is used in the Syrian
Christian Church, in the Jewish liturgy, and still lives in the villages of
the Anti-Lebanon, in South East Anatolia, and on the Eastern shores of Lake
Urmia in Armenia. (21)
Thus the opinion of Emil G.H. Kraeling (22) that the Aramean was the vehicle
by which the so called eternal values of Hellas and Israel were communicated
throughout the Orient, in a way concurs with the Opinion of the Jewish
Encyclopedia referred to above. (23)
That those values denoted by Hellas
withered and almost disappeared, while those as denoted by Israel through
Christianity, flourished until relatively recently, is merely further proof
that money power must destroy the body on which it feeds, and is nourished,
and the body it fed on at the time herein recorded, that is, immediately
after Alexander, was Hellas, and indeed, Israel itself.
It cannot flourish
alongside blind belief and simple faith which instinctively tear off its
impudent claims as they gnaw their way into the very heart of the Tree of
Life.
Nevertheless, out of Babylonian money power itself, oblivious it seems to
its own real self interest, carrying Christianity as far as those limits
unto which its total hegemony prevailed, Christianity itself rose as an
island of love and goodness in an ocean of hatred, confusion, greed, and
depravity that had come to exist as the ultimate result of at least three
thousand years of the depredations of such private money creative power...
With one convulsive shrug it threw off the snake like coils, reestablishing
thereafter the natural order of life, of god, priest-king and priesthood and
the people, all living as was ordained, with faith, piety, and sure
belief...
Thereafter, for a thousand years, International Money Power can
only be faintly discerned, as a smoldering ember; a fire not entirely
extinguished; evidence thereof being an occasional wisp of smoke as it
waited for a day when a certain evil wind might blow, and flames come forth
again to deal man total woe...

that alexander could have no interest in the jews is answered by his own
life and subsequent actions. an astute statesman of penetrating vision,
alexander was quick to grasp the indispensable value of the jews in the
cultural, political and intellectual sphere of his world empire. alexander's
aim was the synthesis of Occidental and Oriental cultures into the mould of
Hellenism; undoubtedly he appreciated the capacity of the Jews to absorb
foreign culture, while rigidly maintaining their national identity thus
making them an ideal vehicle for his civilizing enterprise. As Jews were
already an International commercial power, numbers of them being found in
most countries of Alexander's domain, he granted them many political
privileges when he founded alexandria, and even gave them a portion of
samaria with exemption from taxes in order to gain their support. it is even
possible that alexander had first heard of the jews from his teacher,
aristotle who, according to the report of josephus, had met a jew who was a
veritable philosopher and a "Greek" not only in language but in soul."
