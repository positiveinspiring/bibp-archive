# New World Disorder - Emerging Division Between East and West Threatens to 
Plunge the Globe into Chaos

In general, over the last several decades
the world has experienced an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity.
The opening up of relations with China and
the "end of the Cold War" resulted in an extended period of cooperation
between east and west that was truly unique in the annals of history.
But now things are shifting.
The
civil war in Ukraine and the crash of
MH17 have created an enormous amount of tension between the United
States and Russia, and many analysts believe that relations between the
two superpowers are now even worse than they were during the end of the
Cold War era.
In addition, the indictment of five PLA
officers for cyber espionage and sharp disagreements over China's
territorial claims in the South China Sea (among other issues) have
caused U.S. relations with China to dip to their lowest point since at
least 1989.
So could the emerging division between the
east and the west ultimately plunge us into a period of global chaos?
And what would that mean for the world economy?
For as long as most Americans can remember,
the U.S. dollar and the U.S. financial system have been overwhelmingly
dominant. But now the powers of the east appear to be determined to
break this monopoly.
Four of
the BRICS nations (China, Russia, India
and Brazil) are on the list of the top ten biggest economies on the
planet, and they are starting to make moves to become much less
dependent on the U.S.-centered financial system of the western world.
For example, just last week the BRICS
nations established
two new institutions which are intended to be alternatives to
the World Bank and the IMF...
So in their summit, from July 14 to 16,
the five BRICS announced two major initiatives
aimed squarely at increasing their
power in global finance.
They announced the launch of the New
Development Bank, headquartered in Shanghai, that will offer
financing for development projects in the emerging world. The bank
will act as an alternative to the
Washington, D.C.-based World Bank.
The BRICS also formed what theyre
calling a Contingent Reserve Arrangement, a series of currency
agreements which can be utilized to help them smooth over financial
imbalances with the rest of the world.
Thats something the IMF does now.
Clearly,
the idea is to create institutions
and processes to supplement - and perhaps eventually supplant - the
functions of those managed by U.S. and Europe.
And they would be resources that they
could control on their own, without the annoying conditions that
the World Bank and the IMF always
slap on their loans and assistance.
This comes at a time when both China and
Russia are seeking to emphasize their own currencies and move away from
using the U.S. dollar so much.
Even in the western media, it is being
admitted that China's yuan is "a
growing force in global finance", and according to CNBC
the use of Chinese currency in international trade is growing very
rapidly...
Of the German companies profiled, 23
percent are using the renminbi to settle trades, up from 9 percent
last year, while usage in Hong Kong rose to 58 percent from 50
percent and to 17 percent from 9 percent in the U.S.
Usage of the renminbi among French
companies - a new addition to this year's list - was high at 26
percent.
And of course Russia has been actively
pursuing a "de-dollarization strategy" for months now.
Each new round of economic sanctions pushes
Russia even further in the direction of independence from the U.S.
dollar, and Gazprom has been working hard to get large customers to
switch from paying for natural gas in dollars to paying for natural gas
in Euros and other currencies.
For much more on this, see "Russia
Is Doing It - Russia Is Actually Abandoning The Dollar".
At this point, it seems clear that Russia
plans to permanently decouple from the U.S. economy and the U.S.
financial system. Just today we learned that Vladimir Putin plans
to make Russia
less dependent on U.S. companies such as IBM and
Microsoft, and any future rounds of sanctions are likely to
cause even more damage to U.S. firms that do business in Russia.
But potentially much more troubling for the
U.S. economy is the startling deterioration in the relationship between
the Obama administration and China.
Some analysts are even describing this as "a
tipping point"...
One day, the United States indicts five
PLA officers for cybercrimes; the next, the United States claims
victory in WTO disputes over car tariffs and rare earth minerals.
All this is happening while the United
States promises enduring support for Asian allies, and it has moved
openly to challenge the legitimacy of Chinese territorial claims in
the South China Sea.
Meanwhile,
China is busy creating facts on the ground and
water.
Last month, a $1 billion Chinese oil rig
set up operations in territorial waters claimed by Vietnam. In the
East China Sea,
Chinese SU-27 fighter jets have come within
100 feet of Japanese surveillance aircraft.
This was all capped at the recent
Shangri-La Asian Security dialogue in Singapore (Asias annual
defense-ministers meeting): Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel bluntly
described Chinas behavior as "destabilizing, unilateral actions."
The PLA deputy chief of staff, Lt. Gen.
Wang Guanzhong, accused the United States of "hegemonism."
The mood has soured, more than the usual
ups and downs of big-power relationships. The question now is not
whether a "new type of relationship" is in the offing, but rather,
whether U.S.-Chinese relations have reached a tipping point.
Most Americans could not care less about
what China is doing in the South China Sea, but to the Chinese this is a
very, very big deal.
In fact, China just sent
a surveillance vessel to Hawaii as a bit of payback for what
they regard as U.S. "provocations" in the region. In the old days, China
would have probably never have done such a thing.
But China is gaining confidence as the gap
between the U.S. military and the Chinese military
rapidly closes...
Away from the Chinese militarys
expanding capabilities in cyberspace and electronic warfare, Beijing
is growing the size and reach of its naval fleet, advancing its air
force and testing a host of new missiles, the Pentagon said
Thursday.
An annual report to Congress on Chinas
evolving military capability concluded that the modernization was
being driven in part by growing territorial disputes in the East and
South China seas, as well as by Beijings desire to expand its
presence and influence abroad.
In fact, the Chinese military has grown so
powerful that we are now seeing headlines such as this one
in The Week,
"China thinks it can defeat America in battle".
And the Russian military has made tremendous
strides as well. Putin has been working hard to modernize the Russian
nuclear arsenal, the Russians now have
a "fifth generation" fighter jet that
is supposedly far superior to the F-22 Raptor, and they have nuclear
submarines that are so incredibly quiet that the U.S. Navy refers to
them as "black
holes".
If Russia and China stay united, they are
more than capable of providing a counterbalance to U.S. power around the
globe.
But even if military conflict is not in our
immediate future, the breakdown in relations between east and west could
still have a dramatic impact on the global economy.
Over the years, the U.S. and China have
developed a highly symbiotic relationship that fuels a tremendous amount
of economic activity all over the planet. Each year, we buy hundreds of
billions of dollars of products from the Chinese.
Just imagine what our stores would look like
if we took everything that was "made in China" out of them. And after we
send them giant piles of our money, we beg the Chinese to lend it back
to us at ultra-low interest rates.
This arrangement has allowed China to become
extremely wealthy and it has allowed Americans to enjoy a massively
inflated standard of living fueled by ever increasing amounts of debt.
So what happens if this relationship starts
breaking down? Without a doubt, it could potentially lead to global
chaos.
So keep a close eye on this emerging
division between the east and the west. It could end up being far more
important than most Americans would ever dare to imagine.
