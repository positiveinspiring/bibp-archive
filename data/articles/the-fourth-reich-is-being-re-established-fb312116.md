The
4th Reich is being re-established
This Awareness indicates that this
being more likened unto the Gestapo branch of Nazi Germany. Much relates back
to Nazi Germany, partly because many of the Nazi elite were brought into this
country by the Rockefellers after World War ll and these entities were put
into high positions in this government and gradually have been used for training
others and for re-establishing what may be termed as the 4th Reich.
The 4th
Reich being the new version of the 3rd Reich of Nazi Germany
This Awareness indicates the 4th
Reich being the new version of the 3rd Reich of Nazi Germany. This Awareness
indicates it appears the plan would use these entities to go into houses section
by section in cities, getting rid of various people on a list of troublemakers,
or entities who they consider to be possible troublemakers; anyone who has
had difficulties with police, with law enforcement, or who has been public
and vocal against the New World Order; anyone who has guns or munitions in
their home, and these entities have the equipment to spot such by the vibrations
of a kind of metal detector type equipment; anyone who has connections with
patriot organizations or militia type groups: these would be the population
targets.
Also, in some cases they may select
certain areas to harass the people, just because that area appears to be undesirable,
or to have undesirables located in it. This Awareness indicates the plan being
of course to intimidate the masses, to destroy, as indicated, two-thirds of
the population. It is part of a policy or program that could then be implemented
throughout the world to reduce the world population by two-thirds.
This Awareness indicates that in
starting with the United States it would bring complete control of this country
to its knees and give that control to the elite. This Awareness indicates
of course, this is assuming that there is enough of these entities in the
elite corps who would go against their citizens and conducts these activities
in the manner that the Nazi Gestapo did. This Awareness indicates it is seen
as probable that this could occur.

Nelson Rockefeller
brings 3000 Nazis Illegally into U.S.
This Awareness indicates that the
continued growth of the Nazi party after World War ll was enhanced when
Nelson
Rockefeller brought 3000 Nazis, disguised and given passports under other
names, into the United states, and set up a kind of an organization using
these entities.
Mind Control Projects
out of Atlantic Richfield Corp.
Many of these entities became agents
of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), NASA, also NSA, and in the
FBI and
other government agencies, so that the Nazis had more or less totally infiltrated
the United States government in may of its key and sensitive positions.
This Awareness indicates that they
were used in and given jobs within many of the corporations owned by the Rockefellers,
including Atlantic Richfield. This Awareness indicates that it was through
Atlantic Richfield that much of the mind control programs were implemented
and used. This Awareness indicates that many who went through World war ll
thought they had completed the war and that the atrocities of the Nazi at
that time were at an end, but indeed, they have come back as the 4th Reich.
The Nazis in this country are well hidden, or to be more precise, their role
as Nazis is well hidden.
Bush's "Skull
& Bones Society" a Nazi Organization
This Awareness indicates that the
previous readings given by this Awareness have made reference to
George Bush
as having been involved in the
Skull and Bones Society of Berlin, during Hitler's
early years, and the Skull & Bones Society was still Nazi orientated and
that there appeared to be a link between George Bush and the Nazi orientation
from the Skull & Bones Society.
Various
Scenarios on How the NWO will spread should America fall
This Awareness indicates that in
the scenario of a New World Order , each nation will deliver its own people
into a loyalty to the United Nations. It is likened unto pledging allegiance
to the United nations for a particular reason, wherein the people will have
been conditioned to cooperate. This is the plan.
***
(ET's and "Christ's Return a possibility)
The United
Nations an international bankers organization
***
This Awareness indicates of course
there will have to be certain situations that occur to make the people cooperative.
There are several potentials ranging from economic disaster to potential global
disaster such as earthquakes or war or famine, to the scenario of extraterrestrial
interference with human affairs, whereby entities are brought together to
fight off extraterrestrials, or to embrace extraterrestrials as new deliverers
or saviors of the world.
The
United Nations which is a Rothschild organization, which is an international banking organization. It
is basically own by the international bankers, established by them, set up
by them, and influenced and basically controlled by them.
Kissinger's
"ET Card" -- Make Peace or Die from ET Threat
This Awareness reminds you of the
statement of Henry Kissinger, after the Oklahoma bombing, when he spoke and
said: "It is time to play the ET card." This Awareness indicates
that the ET card was used in the Peace Accord at Dayton, Ohio, and this is
a continuation of the ET card. In Dayton, Ohio, the leaders of the factions
in the Bosnia/Croatian/Serb war were brought in, taken down an elevator underground,
shown the remains of the alien bodies, warned of the alien threat to humanity,
and told that they had to find peace in their area because there was a great
threat to humanity by extraterrestrials.
Whatever the case may be, whatever
the scenario may be, the circumstance will be designed to influence the masses
to go along with the delivery aspects of giving their nation to the United
Nations for its collective guidance of all nations, and those countries that
do not cooperate and go along with this action will be gradually ostracized
and possibly even punished in the future.
The ostracizing of the nations would
include economic boycotts and a kind of a cut-off of any culture and economic
relating, so that the nation loses any foreign trades to or from its borders,
so that contacts with the nation would be considered outlawed. Eventually,
the hope would be that the nations would join with the United Nations of the
world and become part of the New World Order.
This Awareness indicates that in
order for these countries to be thus coerced into this action, the leaders
would need to be enticed into thinking something for themselves would come
of delivering the country to the New World Order, and thus, those in leadership
within each country would hope to gain something from the New World Order
personally, and individually and collectively.
Meanwhile, the people of each nation
would be hoping to see something worthwhile come from from their country being
delivered to
the United Nations and losing its own sovereignty. This Awareness
indicates that it does appear that once entities begin to get closer to this
day of reckoning, more questions will be asked, more skepticism and more suspicion
will be spread among the people. Rumors will fly, and even though the media
of each country will promote the New World Order, there will be many people
who will object and have grave doubts about this NWO and its real purpose.

United Nations
Troops are Butchers not Saviors
(Revelations of Awareness 92-12)
This Awareness wishes to discuss
briefly the nature of the United Nations armies. That during the presentation
in Arcadia, a film was shown in which the United Nations armies were brought
into a West African nation to bring peace. They encountered several hundred
civilians and thus, opened fire on them with machine guns and rifles. The
masses, the several hundred women and children were all slaughtered by the
United Nations troops who had come to bring peace, and they joked and laughed
about their job and how they had completed that and now must go on and find
others. The film itself has been brought back to put on television to alert
the masses but no station would allow it to be shown, and thus, the film was
presented at this meeting and was made available for individuals to purchase,
but such does not allow the masses to know what really occurs with these mercenary
United Nation troops who are basically working for the Nazis,
the Rothschilds
and
the Rockefellers.
