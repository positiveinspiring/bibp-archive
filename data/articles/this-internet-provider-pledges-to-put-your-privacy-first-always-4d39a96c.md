wants to create the world's
first Internet provider designed to be surveillance-resistant.

Nicholas Merrill is planning to
revolutionize online privacy with a concept as simple as it is ingenious:
a telecommunications provider designed from
its inception to shield its customers from surveillance.
Merrill, 39, who previously ran a New York-based
Internet provider, told CNET that he's raising funds to launch a national
"non-profit telecommunications provider dedicated to privacy, using
ubiquitous encryption" that will sell mobile phone service and, for as
little as $20 a month, Internet connectivity.
The ISP would not merely employ every technological means at its disposal,
including encryption and limited logging, to protect its customers. It would
also - and in practice this is likely more important - challenge government
surveillance demands of dubious legality or constitutionality.
A decade of revelations has underlined the intimate relationship between
many telecommunications companies and Washington officialdom.
Leading providers including AT&T and
Verizon
handed billions of customer telephone records to the
National
Security Agency;
By contrast, Merrill says his ISP, to be run by a non-profit called
the Calyx Institute with for-profit
subsidiaries, will put customers first
"Calyx will use all legal and technical
means available to protect the privacy and integrity of user data," he
says.
Merrill is in the unique position of being the
first ISP exec to fight back against the Patriot Act's expanded police
powers - and win.
Nick Merrill says that,
"we will use all legal and
technical means to resist having to hand over information,
and aspire to be the partner
in the telecommunications industry
that ACLU and EFF have always
needed but never had."

In February 2004, the FBI sent Merrill a secret
"national security letter" (not an actual court order signed by a judge)
asking for confidential information about his customers and forbidding him
from disclosing the letter's existence. He enlisted the ACLU to fight the
gag order, and won.
A federal judge
barred the FBI from invoking
that portion of the law, ruling it was,
"an unconstitutional prior restraint of
speech in violation of the First Amendment."
Merrill's identity was kept confidential for
years as the litigation continued.
In 2007, the Washington Post published
his
anonymous op-ed which said:
"I resent being conscripted as a secret
informer for the government," especially because "I have doubts about
the legitimacy of the underlying investigation."
He wasn't able to
discuss his case publicly
until 2010.
His recipe for Calyx was inspired by those six years of interminable legal
wrangling with the Feds:
Take wireless service like that offered by
Clear, which
began selling 4G WiMAX broadband in 2009. Inject end-to-end
encryption for Web browsing. Add e-mail that's stored in encrypted form,
so even Calyx can't read it after it arrives.
Wrap all of this up into an easy-to-use
package and sell it for competitive prices, ideally around $20 a month
without data caps, though perhaps prepaid for a full year.
"The idea that we are working on is to not
be capable of complying" with requests from the FBI for stored e-mail
and similar demands, Merrill says.
A 1994 federal law called the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) was highly controversial when it was
enacted because it required telecommunications carriers to configure their
networks for
easy wiretappability by the FBI.
But even CALEA says that ISPs,
"shall not be responsible for decrypting"
communications if they don't possess "the information necessary to
decrypt."
Translation:
make sure your customers own their data and
only they can decrypt it.
Merrill has formed an
advisory board with
members including,
-
Sascha Meinrath from the New America
Foundation
-
former NSA technical director Brian Snow
-
Jacob Appelbaum from the Tor Project
"I have no doubt that such an organization
would be extremely useful," ACLU deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer
wrote in a letter last month.
"Our ability to protect individual privacy
in the realm of telecommunications depends on the availability of phone
companies and ISPs willing to work with us, and unfortunately the number
of companies willing to publicly challenge the government is exceedingly
small."
The next step for Merrill is to raise about $2
million and then, if all goes well, launch the service later this year.
Right now Calyx is largely self-funded.
Thanks to a travel grant from the Ford
Foundation, Merrill is heading to the San Francisco Bay Area later this
month to meet with venture capitalists and individual angel investors.
"I am getting a lot of stuff for free since
everyone I've talked to is crazy about the idea," Merrill says. "I am
getting all the back-end software written for free by
Riseup using a
grant they just got."
While the intimacy of the relationship between
Washington and telecommunications companies varies over time, it's existed
in one form or another for decades.
In his 2006 book titled "State of War," New York
Times reporter James Risen wrote:
"The NSA has extremely close relationships
with both the telecommunications and computer industries, according to
several government officials. Only a very few top executives in each
corporation are aware of such relationships."
Louis Tordella, the longest-serving
deputy director of the NSA, acknowledged overseeing a project to intercept
telegrams in the 1970s.
Called Project Shamrock, it relied on the major
telegraph companies including Western Union secretly turning over copies of
all messages sent to or from the United States.
"All of the big international carriers were
involved, but none of 'em ever got a nickel for what they did," Tordella
said before his death in 1996, according to
a history written by L.
Britt Snider, a Senate aide who became the CIA's inspector general.
Like the eavesdropping system that President
George W. Bush
secretly authorized,
Project Shamrock had a "watch list" of
people whose conversations would be identified and plucked out of the ether
by NSA computers.
It was initially intended to be used for foreign
intelligence purposes, but at its peak, 600 American citizens appeared on
the list, including,
Nick Merrill says that,
"if we were given any orders
that were questionable,
we wouldn't hesitate to
challenge them in court."

Even if Calyx encrypts everything, the
surveillance arms of the FBI and the bureau's lesser-known counterparts will
still have other legal means to eavesdrop on Americans, of course.
Police can
remotely install spyware on a
suspect's computer. Or
install keyloggers by breaking into a home or office.
Or, as the Secret Service outlined at last year's RSA conference, they can
try to guess passwords and conduct physical surveillance.
That prospect doesn't exactly please the FBI.
Last year, CNET was the first to report that the
FBI warned Congress about what it dubbed
the "Going Dark" problem, meaning
when police are thwarted in conducting court-authorized eavesdropping
because Internet companies aren't required to build in back doors in
advance, or because the technology doesn't permit it.
FBI general counsel Valerie Caproni said
at the time that agents armed with wiretap orders need to be able to conduct
surveillance of "Web-based e-mail, social networking sites, and peer-to-peer
communications technology."
But until Congress changes the law, a privacy-first ISP like Calyx will
remain perfectly legal.
"It's a really urgent problem that is crying
out for a solution," Merrill says.
Update 12:05 p.m. PT
This article sparked a
lengthy Reddit thread,
complete with repeated suggestions that Nick Merrill should turn to Kickstarter to raise money.
Merrill told me this morning that Kickstarter,
"wouldn't accept Calyx as a campaign because
it's not a physical product, or arts-related."
But he has set up a contribution page, with a $1
million target, on
IndieGogo.com, a self-described crowdfunding platform.
"There has been a ton of interest in the
idea," Merrill told me. "Due to popular demand I have decided to try
crowd-sourced funding the idea in order to prove that the demand
exists."
If he makes the $1 million target, IndieGogo
takes a smaller percentage. Internet privacy aficionados, what say you?
