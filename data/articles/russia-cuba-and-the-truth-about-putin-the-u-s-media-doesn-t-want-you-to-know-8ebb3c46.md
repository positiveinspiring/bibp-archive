# Russia, Cuba and the Truth about Putin the U.S. Media Doesn't Want You to 
Know

The Ukraine bill, a
straight-ahead cave to unreconstructed cold warriors on
Capitol Hill, ranks among Obama's most craven and cowardly
foreign policy decisions.
Sanctions are pointless on
Wednesday, but let us provide for more of them on Thursday
because the Russophobes, blunt instruments all, require
them.
The Russian press wants to think
Obama signed the Ukraine bill reluctantly. I want to think
the Cuba move was an expression of who the man buried in
America's version of the deep state truly is. Maybe we are
both right. But the Russian press and I have to get off the
question of obscured intent.
In the end this is a
distraction...
Obama's State Department and
Treasury are not stocked with end-of-history neoliberals by
coincidence or some kind of carryover from
the Bush II
years. They are staffed as they are because Obama subscribes
as avidly as any of them to the neoliberal agenda.
Obama last week on normalizing
with Cuba and "our enduring objective":
"The Cuban regime still
represses its people. This chips away at this
hermetically sealed society, and I believe offers the
best prospect, then, of leading to greater freedom,
greater self-determination on the part of the Cuban
people."
Obama last week on more
sanctions against Russia:
"As I have said many times,
our goal is to promote a diplomatic solution that
provides a lasting resolution to the conflict and helps
to promote growth and stability
in Ukraine and
regionally, including in Russia."
I celebrate the Cuba opening:
Triumphantly right for the
wrong reason.
I join a swelling number of
Europeans in condemning Obama's new provision for extending
sanctions against Russia:
It is abjectly wrong for the same
wrong reason. Tactics are all that is at issue. Strategy
remains constant.
There is no reason whatever to
expect the Cuban leadership to change in consequence of
normalization. I stand with Sen. Marco Rubio and the
rest of the Castrophobes on this point.
I depart on a dime from
conservatives beyond this. In the Cuban case, the Russian
case and all others, the ambition to inspire "regime change"
- the single most self-deluding of all our euphemisms, in my
view - is an intrusion without justification.
Fidel Castro must have taken up,
"Take Me as I Am or Let Me
Go" as soon as the great Ray Price wrote it in
1967.
Castro stayed the course and
built one of the world's most socially just societies - this
by the U.N.'s reckoning, not merely mine.
One hopes Raúl and his
successors keep singing, for Rubio and the conservatives are
right on this point, too:
In a half-century war of
attrition with inappropriate American objectives, Cuba
has just won. We are all better off.
And so we will be if the same
outcome emerges in Washington's confrontation with Russia.
Conveniently, the Cuban opening gives us just the lens
through which to view the Russian question as a very
destructive year draws to a close. No, Russian society is not
remotely comparable to Cuba's. This is for Russians to think
about, as I have argued previously, and changes nothing for
the rest of us.
Read the transcript of Vladimir
Putin's press conference last week, an annual affair with
none of the phony staging and screened questions American
leaders require. It is
here.
"We are protecting our
independence, our sovereignty and our right to exist,"
the Russian leader said among much else.
Think about this. It is not the
remark of a man who plans to go anywhere soon. Think about it again while
looking back on the year now ending.
Then ask:
The
American press did all it
could to caricature Putin's exchange with journalists.
My favorite among the strivers
was BusinessWeek, for which
magazine, I suppose we have to
call it, Putin's press conference was "surreal,"
"extremely
long and very weird."
Read the piece
here.
The juvenile vocabulary is for a
purpose. Surreal, weird press conferences do not have to be
considered, to say nothing of understood. The above
questions do not have to be asked. Asking them would be a
very bad thing. So would understanding.
It is a long way down the hill
from last December, when the Independence Square protests in
Kiev were gaining momentum. Washington was meddling, as was
soon exposed, but Putin continued simply to watch as his
ally in the presidential palace, Viktor Yanukovych,
got deeper and deeper into trouble.
Then the crypto-Nazis and
devotees of violence turned popular, vital, justified
demonstrations into an unjustified coup.
That changed everything, of
course, and the rest is our very recent history. Americans
do not like history because it is too revealing of events as
they are, and it is hence left out of American coverage of
Ukraine from the moment I describe onward until now. But it
is there, as paying-attention people know.
As it happens, a growing number
of Europeans now count among what Germans call Putin
Versteher, "Putin understanders."
A Financial Times columnist
explains the phenomenon
here, though about as well
as BusinessWeek explained Putin's presser last week. Gerhard Schröder, the Social Democratic chancellor from 1998 to
2005, is a noted understander.
So are a lot of left
parliamentarians, a lot of German business executives, and a
lot of Europeans other than Germans.
Very mixed bag...
The simplest way to explain the
understanders' view is to say these are people with a grasp
of history - recent history, Cold War history, and, the best
of them, history going back to the West's response to the
1917 revolution.
When Putin asserts that Russia's
sovereignty and "right to exist" are at stake, they are
capable of acknowledging what he means.
A grasp of history and, in the
case of the business people, a queasy-making grasp of just
how destructive sanctions - as they are, never mind new ones
- are already beginning to prove outside of Russia as well
as in it. Europe today has little of the stamina it had in
2008 to withstand financial and economic contagion. And here
comes the contagion, like a westward wind off the Russian
steppes.
Currency markets in Russia's
neighbors are already in chaos.
Every day you read - not in
the American press, of course - of devaluations against the
Euro, new foreign exchange controls, forex markets closing
altogether.
Here is a telling detail:
Last week the Swiss
cut interest rates to less than zero - you pay to deposit
funds - so as to head off a rush of weak-currency holders
into the franc.
Mayhem in the making, and eerily
like the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, as mentioned in
this space a couple of weeks back.
Among European leaders,
something like a revolt against the American sanctions
regime appears to be coalescing.
At gatherings in Brussels
last week, Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, French
President François Hollande and the Danish foreign minister,
Martin Lidegaard, all said in different ways,
"Enough with
the sanctions already."
Renzi said it best:
"Absolutely no
to more sanctions."
In view of the damage already
being wrought, and with more on the way in the year to come,
there is a "why" question attaching to
the Ukraine crisis
and the West's American-led policy toward Russia.
What is
all this for, exactly? Answer this and we will answer a lot
for ourselves.
My answer begins here. It is
time we Americans understand exactly what is meant when our
leaders use the word "freedom." It is supposed to designate
one of those values none of us would think of assailing. Let
us assail it.
Freedom for most
English-speakers may bear its obvious meaning, but in truth
it bears many.
Amartya Sen, the Harvard
Nobelist in economics, wrote a great book some years ago
called "Development as Freedom."
For him, freedom means a
society,
-
wherein one is safe from poverty
-
where education,
health care, sewage and what we call "public goods" are
available
-
where there is authentic opportunity to realize
oneself
-
where one can work with the expectation of
earning a decent living
Absent these, there is - one of Sen's great coinages - "unfreedom."
Freedom in the American dialect,
at least as almost all our leaders use the term, means
something rather different.
This is freedom for private
enterprise and it is more or less full stop there. My
coinage would be this: In the official American meaning, we
mean neoliberal freedom, which is to say, freedom for
corporations. Look out the window if you are at all confused
or doubtful.
As a useful aside, we ought to
think about this when we hear American leaders talk about
repression and the absence of freedom in Cuba.
-
Who is
repressed and unfree - teenagers of African descent, as in
America, or spooks, adventurers, saboteurs and Batista
nostalgists, as America has urged these on for 50 years?
-
Which sort of repression is justified and which to be
condemned?
It is the
banner of neoliberal freedom Vicky Nuland, Vice President
Biden, CIA Director John Brennan and all others bear when
they travel to Ukraine.
Arsenyi Yatsenyuk, the prime
minister in Kiev, bears it. That is why he is popular in
Washington. So does Petro Poroshenko, the candy-bar
billionaire turned president. Ditto his popularity on these
shores.
N.B.: None of these people has
anything to say about democracy or the attributes of Sen's
notion of freedom, do they? They speak incessantly of
"reforms." Reform is part of the neoliberal lexicon, another
code word, like freedom. We will see this banner unfurl in
the course of the year to come.
As a curtain-raiser, consider
Yatsenyuk's recent presentation in parliament, as outlined
and analyzed
here.
Were I an ordinary Ukrainian, I would find the robotic
inhumanity of Yatsenyuk's list if reforms absolutely
frightening. No wonder so many seek refuge in Russia.
As noted in earlier columns, I
have been engaged in a lively exchange lately on the topics
of Ukraine and Russia with good sources in the global energy
and commodities markets. In specific answer to the why
question, I can do no better than reproduce part of a long
note that arrived a couple of days ago from Europe.
The South Stream this source
mentions is the gas pipeline Russia just canceled in
response to deteriorating relations with Europe:
.Also, what is at stake is
the W. European gas market. In the daily froth of the
media, Asia is seen as the big prize of America's
natural gas producers
But in the industry, fewer and
fewer people are seeing it that way. The terminal market
for America's shale gas will not be Asia, but Europe
And to grab that market, the South Stream has to be
stopped, and a big wedge driven between Russia and W.
Europe
That is where the strategy in support of the
regime which has grabbed power in Kleptokrainia fits
in
More and more evidently, it is
to American energy interests that we have to look to find
the specifics of the why question.
If the object is to
disrupt ties between Russia and its westward neighbors - a
forlorn project, in my view - it explains why Washington
pops up with more sanctions or the threat of them, as with
Obama's new bill, so often when there seems to be a break in
the clouds. I have found this weird over the months but do
not any longer.
To me the question of Russia and
the West comes down to one thing:
It is bound to become
messier in the year to come because a mess, in effect,
appears to be exactly what Washington wants.
One of two
relationships will suffer a critical breach:
I dearly hope it is the
latter and think there is a good chance it will be.
Footnote:
I will file one more column before year's end. Good enough
to send readers the sincerest season's greetings I can think
of now. To all of you, have a terrorist-free holiday! May we
all continue to breathe into the new year.
