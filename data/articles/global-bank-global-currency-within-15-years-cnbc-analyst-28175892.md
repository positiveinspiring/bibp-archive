Head of market analysis for Schneider Foreign
Exchange Stephen Gallo told CNBC yesterday that the financial crisis will
lead to the creation of a global central bank and a global single currency
within 15 years, echoing the call of top globalists who have exploited the
problems they created to push for a new world financial order.
Highlighting the significance of the introduction of the Euro, Gallo said
that the single currency was,
where we are headed globally on a monetary
basis over the course of the next 10 to 15 years.
Stating that one of the things that caused the financial crisis was an over
expansion of the money supply on a global basis, Gallo said,
Over the
course of the next couple of decades central banks are going to need to pay
more attention to whats going on with the global money supply rather than
the money supply just in their own borders, a necessity that, might call
into question the need for some kind of global central bank or a global
central bank thats united by central banks for bigger monetary areas
underneath that global central bank.
As we have highlighted before,
the elite have exploited the problem that
they created to push for increased centralization and regulation of the
world economic system in the pursuit of a de-facto global financial
dictatorship.
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, EU heads such as
Joaquin Almunia and
establishment media outlets like the Wall Street Journal amongst many others
have all used the economic crisis as an excuse to argue for greater
financial power, a new world economic order in which control is
concentrated into fewer hands - with the
IMF and the
World Bank enjoying the
spoils.
UK Business Secretary and top
Bilderberg member Peter Mandelson
has also
pushed for a,
Bretton Woods for this century, to help build the machinery
of global economic governance.
Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, German Chancellor
Angela Merkel and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy
all made the same appeal at a conference in
Paris on the future of capitalism last month.
-
Merkel called for the creation of a new global economic body under the UN,
similar to the Security Council, to judge government policy.
-
Sarkozy called for a new world, new capitalism during his speech, as he
commented In capitalism of the 21st century, there is room for the state.
-
Meanwhile, Blair called for a new financial order which he said should be
constructed upon values other than the maximum short-term profit.
The globalists created the problem of wildly irresponsible fractional
reserve banking, the debt bubble and the credit crunch by ceaselessly
inflating the money supply and now they are offering their solution to the
crisis by posing as the saviors and promising to fix the crisis, but only
if
complete control of the global financial system be signed over to them.
As Ron Paul, Peter Schiff and their ilk have tirelessly argued
(below insert), the only way
to solve the financial crisis is to allow incompetent banks and companies to
fail, not to reward their misdeeds by giving them billions in taxpayer
money.
The only way to re-capitalize the world is to provide incentives for
people to work hard and save money, not by creating more credit out of thin
air, which is what caused the problem in the first place.
The globalists call for a centralized global economic order has nothing to
do with providing solutions to the crisis but everything to do with
providing themselves with more power and control over the world financial
system.
