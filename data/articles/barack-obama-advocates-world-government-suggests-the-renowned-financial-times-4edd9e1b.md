The Financial Times, one of the most respected
and widely read newspapers on the planet, features an editorial today that
openly admits the agenda to create a world government based on
anti-democratic principles and concedes that the term "global governance" is
merely a euphemism for the move towards a centralized global government.
For years we were called paranoid nutcases for warning about
the elite's
plans to centralize global power and destroy American sovereignty.
Throughout the 1990's people who talked about the alarming move towards
global government were smeared as right-wing lunatics by popular culture and
the media.
Now the agenda is out in the open and in our faces, the debunkers
have no more ammunition with which to deride us.
A jaw-dropping editorial written by the Financial Times' chief foreign
affairs commentator Gideon Rachman entitled 'And
now for a world government' lays out the plan for global
government and how it is being pushed with deceptive language and euphemisms
in order to prevent people from becoming alarmed.
"For the first time in my life, I think the formation of some sort of world
government is plausible," writes Rachman, citing the financial crisis,
"global warming" and the "global war on terror" as three major pretexts
through which it is being introduced.
Rachman writes that "global governance" could be introduced much sooner than
many expect and that President elect Barack Obama has already expressed his
desire to achieve that goal, making reference to Obama's circle of advisors
which includes Strobe Talbott, who in 1992 stated,
"In the next century,
nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single,
global authority. National sovereignty wasn't such a great idea after all."
Rachman then concedes that the more abstract term "global governance," which
is often used by top globalists like
David Rockefeller as a veil to offset
accusations that a centralized global government is the real agenda, is
merely a trick of "soothing language" that is used to prevent "people
reaching for their rifles in America's talk-radio heartland".
"But some European thinkers think that they
recognize what is going on,"
says Rachman.
"Jacques Attali, an adviser to President Nicolas Sarkozy of
France, argues that:
"Global governance is just a euphemism for global
government."
As far as he is concerned, some form of global government
cannot come too soon. Mr Attali believes that the,
"core of the
international
financial crisis is that we have
global financial markets and no global rule
of law".
Rachman proceeds to outline what the first steps to an official world
government would look like, including the creation of,
"A legally binding
climate-change agreement negotiated under the auspices of the UN and the
creation of a 50,000-strong UN peacekeeping force".
"A 'world government' would involve much more than co-operation between
nations," writes Rachman.
"It would be an entity with state-like
characteristics, backed by a body of laws. The European Union has already
set up a continental government for 27 countries, which could be a model.
The EU has a supreme court, a currency, thousands of pages of law, a large
civil service and the ability to deploy military force."
