This group was organized in 1968 by the Morgenthau Group for the
purpose of accelerating the plans to have the
New
World Order in place by the year 2000.
The Club of Rome developed
a
plan to divide the world into ten regions or kingdoms.
In 1976, the United States Association of the Club of Rome (USACOR)
was formed for the purpose of shutting down the U.S. economy gradually.
The Technotronic Era
Henry Kissinger was then, and still is, an important agent in the service of
the Royal Institute for International Affairs, a member of the
Club of Rome
and the
Council on Foreign Relations.
Kissingers role in destabilizing the United States by means of three wars,
the Middle East, Korea and Vietnam, is well known, as is his role in the
Gulf War, in which the U.S. Army acted as mercenaries for the Committee of
300 in bringing Kuwait back under its control and at the same time making an
example out of Iraq so that other small nations would not be tempted to work
out their own destiny.
The Club of Rome, acting on Committee
of 300 orders to eliminate General ul Haq, had no compunction in
sacrificing the lives of a number of U.S. servicemen on board the flight,
including a U.S. Army Defense Intelligence Agency group headed by Brigadier
General Herber Wassom. General ul Haq had been warned by the Turkish
Secret Service not to travel by plane, as he was targeted for a mid-air
bombing.
With this in mind, ul Haq took the United States
team with him as "an insurance policy," as he commented to his inner circle
advisors.
Club of Rome and its financiers under the title of the German Marshall Fund
were two highly-organized conspiratorial bodies operating under cover of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and that the
majority of Club of Rome executives were drawn from NATO.
The Club of Rome
formulated all of what NATO claimed as its policies and, through the
activities of
Committee of 300 member Lord Carrington, was able to split
NATO into two factions, a political (left wing) power group and its former
military alliance.
The Club of Rome is still one of the most
important foreign policy arms of the Committee of 300, and the other being
the Bilderbergers. It was put together in 1968 from hard-core members of the
original Morgenthau group on the basis of a telephone call made by the late
Aurellio Peccei for a new and urgent drive to speed up the plans of the
One
World Government now called the New World Order.
Pecceis call was answered by the most
subversive "future planners" drawn from the United States, France, Sweden,
Britain, Switzerland and Japan that could be mustered.
During the period 1968-1972, The Club of Rome became a cohesive entity of
new-science scientists, Globalist, future planners and internationalists of
every stripe.
As one delegate put it,
"We became Josephs Coat of Many Colors."
Pecceis book "Human Quality" formed the basis
of the doctrine adopted by NATOs political wing.
Peccei headed the Atlantic Institutes Economic
Council for three decades while he was the Chief Executive Officer for
Giovanni Agnellis Fiat Motor Company.
Agnelli, a member of an ancient
Italian
Black Nobility family of the same name, is one of the most important
members of the Committee of 300. He played a leading role in development
projects in the Soviet Union.
The Club of Rome is a conspiratorial umbrella organization, a marriage
between Anglo-American financiers and the old Black Nobility families of
Europe, particularly the so-called "nobility" of London, Venice and Genoa.
The key to the successful control of the world is their ability to create
and manage savage economic recessions and eventual depressions.
The Committee of 300 looks to social convulsions
on a global scale, followed by depressions, as a softening-up technique for
bigger things to come, as its principal method of creating masses of people
all over the world who will become its "welfare" recipients of the future.
The committee appears to base much of its important decisions affecting
mankind on the philosophy of Polish aristocrat,
Felix Dzerzhinsky, who
regarded mankind as being slightly above the level of cattle.
As a close
friend of British intelligence agent Sydney Reilly (Reilly was actually
Dzerzhinskys controller during the Bolshevik Revolutions formative years),
he often confided in Reilly during his drinking bouts.
Dzerzinski was, of
course, the beast who ran the Red Terror apparatus.
He once told Reilly, while the two were on a
drinking binge, that,
"Man is of no importance. Look at what
happens when you starve him. He begins to eat his dead companions to
stay alive. Man is only interested in his own survival. That is all that
counts. All the Spinoza stuff is a lot of rubbish."
With regard to the Third World, the Club of
Romes Harland Cleveland prepared a report which was the height of cynicism.
At the time, Cleveland was United States
Ambassador to NATO. Essentially, the paper said it would be up to Third
World nations to decide among themselves which populations should be
eliminated.
As Peccei later wrote (based on the Cleveland
Report):
"Damaged by conflicting policies of three
major countries and blocs, roughly patched up here and there, the
existing international economic order is visibly coming apart at the
seams.... The prospect of the necessity of the recourse to triage
deciding who must be saved is a very grim one indeed.
But, if lamentably, events should come to
such a pass, the right to make such decisions cannot be left to just a
few nations because it would lend themselves to ominous power over life
of the worlds hungry."
