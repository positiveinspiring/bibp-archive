Finally, it has started.
People have begun to speak of impeaching
President George W. Bush - not in hushed whispers but openly, in
newspapers, on the Internet, in ordinary conversations and even in Congress.
As a former member of Congress who sat on the
House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment proceedings against
President Richard Nixon, I believe they are right to do so.
I can still remember the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach during
those proceedings, when it became clear that the President had so
systematically abused the powers of the presidency and so threatened the
rule of law that he had to be removed from office. As a Democrat who opposed
many of President Nixon's policies, I still found voting for his impeachment
to be one of the most sobering and unpleasant tasks I ever had to undertake.
None of the members of the committee took pleasure in voting for
impeachment; after all, Democrat or Republican, Nixon was still our
President.
At the time, I hoped that our committee's work would send a strong signal to
future Presidents that they had to obey the rule of law. I was wrong.
Like many others, I have been deeply troubled by Bush's breathtaking scorn
for our international treaty obligations under the United Nations Charter
and the
Geneva Conventions. I have also been
disturbed by the torture scandals and the violations of US criminal laws at
the highest levels of our government they may entail, something I have
written about in these pages [see Holtzman, "Torture
and Accountability," July 18/25, 2005].
These concerns have been compounded by growing
evidence that the President deliberately misled the country into the war in
Iraq. But it wasn't until the most recent revelations that President Bush
directed the wiretapping of hundreds, possibly thousands, of Americans, in
violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)
- and argued that, as Commander in Chief, he had the right in the
interests of national security to override our country's laws - that I felt
the same sinking feeling in my stomach as I did during Watergate.
As a matter of constitutional law, these and other misdeeds constitute
grounds for the impeachment of President Bush. A President, any President,
who maintains that he is above the law - and repeatedly violates the law -
thereby commits high crimes and misdemeanors, the constitutional standard
for impeachment and removal from office.
A high crime or misdemeanor is an archaic term
that means a serious abuse of power, whether or not it is also a crime, that
endangers our constitutional system of government.
The framers of our Constitution feared executive power run amok and provided
the remedy of impeachment to protect against it. While impeachment is a last
resort, and must never be lightly undertaken (a principle ignored during the
proceedings against President Bill Clinton), neither can Congress shirk its
responsibility to use that tool to safeguard our democracy.
No President can be permitted to commit high
crimes and misdemeanors with impunity.
But impeachment and removal from office will not happen unless the American
people are convinced of its necessity after a full and fair inquiry into the
facts and law is conducted. That inquiry must commence now.
Warrantless Wiretaps
On December 17 President Bush acknowledged that he repeatedly
authorized wiretaps, without obtaining a warrant, of American citizens
engaged in international calls. On the face of it, these warrantless
wiretaps violate FISA, which requires court approval for national security
wiretaps and sets up a special procedure for obtaining it. Violation of the
law is a felony.
While many facts about these wiretaps are unknown, it now appears that
thousands of calls were monitored and that the information obtained may have
been widely circulated among federal agencies. It also appears that a number
of government officials considered the warrantless wiretaps of dubious
legality.
Reportedly, several people in the National
Security Agency (NSA) refused to participate in them, and a
deputy attorney general even declined to sign off on some aspects of these
wiretaps. The special FISA court has raised concerns as well, and a judge on
that court has resigned, apparently in protest.
FISA was enacted in 1978, against the backdrop of Watergate, to prevent the
widespread abuses in domestic surveillance that were disclosed in
Congressional hearings. Among his other abuses of power, President Nixon
ordered the FBI to conduct warrantless wiretaps of seventeen journalists and
White House staffers. Although Nixon claimed the wiretaps were done for
national security purposes, they were undertaken for political purposes and
were illegal.
Just as Bush's warrantless wiretaps grew out of
the 9/11 attacks, Nixon's illegal wiretaps grew out of the Vietnam War and
the opposition to it. In fact, the first illegal Nixon wiretap was of a
reporter who, in 1969, revealed the secret bombing of Cambodia, a program
that President Nixon wanted to hide from the American people and Congress.
Nixon's illegal wiretaps formed one of the many grounds for the articles of
impeachment voted against him by a bipartisan majority of the House
Judiciary Committee.
Congress explicitly intended FISA to strike a balance between the legitimate
requirements of national security on the one hand and the need both to
protect against presidential abuses and to safeguard personal privacy on the
other. From Watergate, Congress knew that a President was fully capable of
wiretapping under a false claim of national security.
That is why the law requires court review of
national security wiretaps. Congress understood that because of the huge
invasion of privacy involved in wiretaps, there should be checks in place on
the executive branch to protect against overzealous and unnecessary
wiretapping. At the same time, Congress created special procedures to
facilitate obtaining these warrants when justified. Congress also recognized
the need for emergency action: The President was given the power to start a
wiretap without a warrant as long as court permission was obtained within
three days.
FISA can scarcely be claimed to create any obstacle to justified national
security wiretaps. Since 1978, when the law was enacted, more than 10,000
national security warrants have been approved by the FISA court; only four
have been turned down.
Two legal arguments have been offered for the President's right to violate
the law, both of which have been seriously questioned by members of Congress
of both parties and by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service
in a recent analysis.
-
The first - highly dangerous in its
sweep and implications - is that the President has the constitutional
right as Commander in Chief to break any US law on the grounds of
national security. As the CRS analysis points out, the Supreme Court has
never upheld the President's right to do this in the area of
wiretapping, nor has it ever granted the President a "monopoly over
war-powers" or recognized him as "Commander in Chief of the country" as
opposed to Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy.
If the President is permitted to break the
law on wiretapping on his own say-so, then a President can break any
other law on his own say-so - a formula for dictatorship. This is not a
theoretical danger: President Bush has recently claimed the right as
Commander in Chief to violate the McCain amendment banning torture and
degrading treatment of detainees. Nor is the requirement that national
security be at stake any safeguard.
We saw in Watergate how President Nixon
falsely and cynically used that argument to cover up ordinary crimes and
political misdeeds.
Ours is a government of limited power. We learn in elementary school the
concept of checks and balances. Those checks do not vanish in wartime;
the President's role as Commander in Chief does not swallow up
Congress's powers or the Bill of Rights. Given the framers' skepticism
about executive power and war-making - there was no functional standing
army at the beginning of the nation, so the President's powers as
Commander in Chief depended on Congress's willingness to create and
expand an army - it is impossible to find in the Constitution unilateral
presidential authority to act against US citizens in a way that violates
US laws, even in wartime.
As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor recently
wrote,
"A state of war is not a blank check for
the President when it comes to the rights of the nation's citizens."
-
The second legal argument in defense
of Bush's warrantless wiretaps rests on an erroneous statutory
interpretation. According to this argument, Congress authorized the
Administration to place wiretaps without court approval when it adopted
the 2001 resolution authorizing military force against the Taliban and
Al Qaeda for the 9/11 attacks.
In the first place, the force resolution
doesn't mention wiretaps. And given that Congress has traditionally
placed so many restrictions on wiretapping because of its extremely
intrusive qualities, there would undoubtedly have been vigorous debate
if anyone thought the force resolution would roll back FISA. In fact,
the legislative history of the force resolution shows that Congress had
no intention of broadening the scope of presidential war-making powers
to cover activity in the United States.
According to Senator Tom Daschle, the
former Senate majority leader who negotiated the resolution with the
White House, the Administration wanted to include language explicitly
enlarging the President's war-making powers to include domestic
activity. That language was rejected. Obviously, if the Administration
felt it already had the power, it would not have tried to insert the
language into the resolution.
What then was the reason for avoiding the FISA
court?
President Bush suggested that there was no time
to get the warrants. But this cannot be true, because FISA permits wiretaps
without warrants in emergencies as long as court approval is obtained within
three days.
Moreover, there is evidence that the President
knew the warrantless wiretapping was illegal. In 2004, when the violations
had been going on for some time, President Bush told a Buffalo, New York,
audience that "a wiretap requires a court order."
He went on to say that,
"when we're talking about chasing down
terrorists, we're talking about getting a court order before we do so."
Indeed, the claim that to protect Americans the
President needs to be able to avoid court review of his wiretap applications
rings hollow. It is unclear why or in what way the existing law, requiring
court approval, is not satisfactory.
And, if the law is too cumbersome or
inapplicable to modern technology, then it is unclear why the President did
not seek to revise it instead of disregarding it and thus jeopardizing many
otherwise legitimate anti-terrorism prosecutions. His defenders' claim that
changing the law would have given away secrets is unacceptable.
There are procedures for considering classified
information in Congress. Since no good reason has been given for avoiding
the FISA court, it is reasonable to suspect that the real reason may have
been that the wiretaps, like those President Nixon ordered in Watergate,
involved journalists or anti-Bush activists or were improper in other ways
and would not have been approved.
It is also curious that President Bush seems so concerned with the
imaginary dangers to Americans posed by US courts but remains so apparently
unconcerned about fixing some of the real holes in our security. For
example, FBI computers - which were unable to search two words at once, like
"flight schools," a defect that impaired the Bureau's ability to identify
the 9/11 attackers beforehand - still haven't been brought into the
twenty-first century.
Given Vice President Cheney's
longstanding ambition to throw off the constraints on executive power
imposed in response to Watergate and the Vietnam War, it may well be that
the warrantless wiretap program has had much more to do with restoring the
trappings of the Nixon imperial presidency than it ever had to do with
protecting national security.
Subverting Our
Democracy
A President can commit no more serious crime against our democracy than
lying to Congress and the American people to get them to support a military
action or war.
It is not just that it is cowardly and abhorrent
to trick others into giving their lives for a nonexistent threat, or even
that making false statements might in some circumstances be a crime. It is
that the decision to go to war is the gravest decision a nation can make,
and in a democracy the people and their elected representatives, when there
is no imminent attack on the United States to repel, have the right to make
it.
Given that the consequences can be death for
hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of people - as well as the
diversion of vast sums of money to the war effort - the fraud cannot be
tolerated. That both Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were
guilty of misleading the nation into military action and neither was
impeached for it makes it more, not less, important to hold Bush
accountable.
Once it was clear that no weapons of mass destruction would be found in
Iraq, President Bush tried to blame "bad intelligence" for the decision to
go to war, apparently to show that the WMD claim was not a deliberate
deception.
But bad intelligence had little or nothing to do
with the main arguments used to win popular support for the invasion of
Iraq.
-
First, there was no serious
intelligence - good or bad - to support the Administration's
suggestion that Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda were in cahoots.
Nonetheless, the Administration repeatedly tried to claim the
connection to show that the invasion was a justified response to
9/11 (like the declaration of war against Japan for Pearl Harbor).
The claim was a sheer fabrication.
-
Second, there was no reliable
intelligence to support the Administration's claim that Saddam was
about to acquire nuclear weapons capability. The specter of the
"mushroom cloud," which frightened many Americans into believing
that the invasion of Iraq was necessary for our self-defense, was
made up out of whole cloth. As for the biological and chemical
weapons, even if, as reported, the CIA director told the President
that these existed in Iraq, the Administration still had plenty of
information suggesting the contrary.
The deliberateness of the deception has also been confirmed by a
British source: the Downing Street memo, the official record of
Prime Minister Tony Blair's July 2002 meeting with his top Cabinet
officials.
At the meeting the chief of British
intelligence, who had just returned from the United States, reported
that,
"Bush wanted to remove Saddam,
through military action, justified by the conjunction of
terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being
fixed around the policy."
In other words, the Bush Administration was
reported to be in the process of cooking up fake intelligence and facts to
justify going to war in Iraq.
During the Nixon impeachment proceedings, I drafted the resolution of
impeachment to hold President Nixon accountable for concealing from Congress
the bombing of Cambodia he initiated. But the committee did not approve it,
probably because it might appear political - in other words, stemming from
opposition to the war instead of to the President's abuse of his war-making
powers.
With respect to President Bush and the Iraq War, there is not
likely to be any such confusion.
Most Americans know that his rationale for the
war turned out to be untrue; for them the question is whether the
President lied, and if so, what the remedies are for his misconduct.
The Failure to Take
Care
Upon assuming the presidency, Bush took an oath of office in which he swore
to take care that the laws would be faithfully executed. Impeachment cannot
be used to remove a President for maladministration, as the debates on
ratifying the Constitution show. But President Bush has been guilty of such
gross incompetence or reckless indifference to his obligation to execute the
laws faithfully as to call into question whether he takes his oath seriously
or is capable of doing so.
The most egregious example is the conduct of the war in Iraq. Unconscionably
and unaccountably, the Administration failed to provide US soldiers with
bulletproof vests or appropriately armored vehicles.
A recent Pentagon study disclosed that proper
bulletproof vests would have saved hundreds of lives. Why wasn't the
commencement of hostilities postponed until the troops were properly
outfitted? There are numerous suggestions that the timing was prompted by
political, not military, concerns. The United States was under no imminent
threat of attack by Saddam Hussein, and the Administration knew it.
They delayed the marketing of the war until
Americans finished their summer vacations because "you don't introduce new
products in August."
As the Downing Street memo revealed, the
timeline for the war was set to start thirty days before the 2002
Congressional elections.
And there was no serious plan for the aftermath of the war, a fact also
noted in the Downing Street memo. The President's failure as
Commander in Chief to protect the troops by arming them properly, and his
failure to plan for the occupation, cost dearly in lives and taxpayer
dollars.
This was not mere negligence or oversight - in
other words, maladministration - but reflected a reckless and grotesque
disregard for the welfare of the troops and an utter indifference to the
need for proper governance of a country after occupation. As such, these
failures violated the requirements of the President's oath of office.
If they are proven to be the product of
political objectives, they could constitute impeachable offenses on those
grounds alone.
Torture and Other
Abuses of Power
President Bush recently proclaimed, "We do not torture."
In view of the revelations of the CIA's
secret jails and practice of rendition, not to mention the Abu Ghraib
scandal, the statement borders on the absurd, recalling Nixon's
famous claim, "I am not a crook." It has been well documented that abuse
(including torture) of detainees by US personnel in connection with the wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq has been systemic and widespread.
Under the
War Crimes Act of 1996 it is a crime for
any US national to order or engage in the murder, torture or inhuman
treatment of a detainee. (When a detainee death results, the act imposes the
death penalty.) In addition, anyone in the chain of command who condones the
abuse rather than stopping it could also be in violation of the act.
The act simply implements the Geneva
Conventions, which are the law of the land.
The evidence before us now suggests that the President himself may have
authorized detainee abuse. In January 2002, after the Afghanistan war had
begun, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales advised President Bush in
writing that US mistreatment of detainees might be criminally prosecutable
under the War Crimes Act.
Rather than order the possibly criminal behavior
to stop, which under the
Geneva Conventions and the War Crimes
Act the President was obligated to do, Bush authorized an "opt-out" of
the Geneva Conventions to try to shield the Americans who were abusing
detainees from prosecution. In other words, the President's response to
reports of detainee abuse was to prevent prosecution of the abusers, thereby
implicitly condoning the abuse and authorizing its continuation.
If torture or inhuman treatment of prisoners
took place as a result of the President's conduct, then he himself may have
violated the War Crimes Act, along with those who actually inflicted the
abuse.
There are many other indications that the President has knowingly condoned
detainee abuse. For example, he never removed Defense Secretary Rumsfeld
from office or disciplined him, even though Rumsfeld accepted responsibility
for the abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib, admitted hiding a detainee from the Red
Cross - a violation of the Geneva Conventions and possibly the War Crimes
Act, if the detainee was being abused - and issued orders (later
withdrawn) for Guantánamo interrogations that violated the Geneva
Conventions and possibly the War Crimes Act.
More recently, the President opposed the McCain Amendment barring torture
when it was first proposed, and he tacitly supported Vice President Cheney's
efforts to get language into the bill that would allow the CIA to torture or
degrade detainees. Now, in his signing statement, the President announced
that he has the right to violate the new law, claiming once again the right
as Commander in Chief to break laws when it suits him.
Furthermore, despite the horrors of the Abu Ghraib scandal, no
higher-ups have been held accountable. Only one officer of any significant
rank has been punished. It is as though the Watergate inquiry stopped with
the burglars, as the Nixon cover-up tried and failed to accomplish.
President Bush has made no serious effort to insure that the full scope of
the scandal is uncovered or to hold any higher-ups responsible, perhaps
because responsibility goes right to the White House.
It is imperative that a full investigation be undertaken of Bush's role in
the systemic torture and abuse of detainees.
Violating his oath of office, the Geneva
Conventions and the War Crimes Act would constitute impeachable offenses.
Next Steps
Mobilizing the nation and Congress in support of investigations and the
impeachment of President Bush is a critical task that has already begun,
but it must intensify and grow.
The American people stopped the Vietnam War -
against the wishes of the President - and forced a reluctant Congress to act
on the impeachment of President Nixon. And they can do the same with
President Bush. The task has three elements: building public and
Congressional support, getting Congress to undertake investigations into
various aspects of presidential misconduct and changing the party makeup of
Congress in the 2006 elections.
Drumming up public support means organizing rallies, spearheading
letter-writing campaigns to newspapers, organizing petition drives,
door-knocking in neighborhoods, handing out leaflets and deploying the full
range of mobilizing tactics. Organizations like
AfterDowningStreet.org and
ImpeachPac.org, actively working on a campaign for impeachment,
are able to draw on a remarkably solid base of public support.
A Zogby poll taken in November - before
the wiretap scandal - showed more than 50 percent of those questioned
favored impeachment of President Bush if he lied about the war in Iraq.
An energized public must in turn bear down on Congress. Constituents should
request meetings with their Senators and Representatives to educate them on
impeachment. They can also make their case through e-mail, letters and phone
calls. Representatives and Senators should be asked specifically to support
hearings on and investigations into the deceptions that led to the Iraq War
and President Bush's role in the torture scandals.
Senators should also be asked to insure that the
hearings already planned by the Senate Judiciary Committee into
warrantless wiretaps are comprehensive. The hearings should evaluate whether
the wiretaps were genuinely used for national security purposes and why the
President chose to violate the law when it was so easy to comply with it.
Representatives should specifically be asked to
co-sponsor Congressman John Conyers's resolution calling for a full
inquiry into presidential abuses.
Finally, if this pressure fails to produce results, attention must be
focused on changing the political composition of the House and Senate in the
upcoming 2006 elections. If a Republican Congress is unwilling to
investigate and take appropriate action against a Republican President, then
a Democratic Congress should replace it.
As awful as Watergate was, after the vote on impeachment and the resignation
of President Nixon, the nation felt a huge sense of relief.
Impeachment is a tortuous process, but now that
President Bush has thrown down the gauntlet and virtually dared
Congress to stop him from violating the law, nothing less is necessary to
protect our constitutional system and preserve our democracy.
