Hank Williams Jr. reprised his role as
a fiery anti-Obama blowhard on Friday, telling fans at a concert that the
president was Muslim and anti-American.
The statement came near the end of a concert at the Iowa State Fair
Grandstand. Williams Jr.'s comments were first reported
in a review by Des
Moines Register reporter Joe Lawler.
According to Lawler, the show was relatively free of politics until the end,
when Williams Jr. made the following claims:
"We've got a Muslim president who hates
farming, hates the military, hates the U.S. and we hate him!"
The comments were apparently met with applause
and loud cheers.
Williams Jr. made waves in October 2011, when he appeared on "Fox and
Friends" and
likened the president to Hitler.
That statement resulted in ESPN yanking Williams Jr.'s opening song from
"Monday Night Football," where the country star's song had played for over
two decades.
Though he later said his "Fox and Friends" comments were "misunderstood,"
Williams Jr. has continued to be outspoken in his dislike of Obama.
He also released a song entitled "Keep the
Change," in which
he derides not only the president but also Fox, who he
describes as,
"twisting [his words] all around."
In a July 2012 interview with Rolling Stone,
Williams Jr.
doubled down on his particularly blunt brand of criticism of
the Obama administration.
"We've got a President that does a call to
the Koran or Mecca or whatever," he told the magazine.
When asked if he believed Obama hated America,
Williams Jr. responded,
"I don't know about that but it's kind of
obvious. I guess when you take a tour, a world tour, to apologize for
America."
A number of entertainers have come out in
support of Obama and/or against the Romney-Ryan ticket.
The Silversun Pickups
issued a strongly worded
cease-and-desist letter to Romney when it was revealed that the campaign had
played one of their songs. The campaign responded by saying it was within
its legal rights in playing "Panic Switch" and added that the song was not
among those usually played and would not be used again.
Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine
wrote a takedown of Rep.
Paul Ryan.
Ryan had previously said that Rage was his
favorite band. In his op-ed, Morello wrote that Ryan represented,
"the embodiment of the machine our music
rages against."
But Williams Jr. is not alone in the
entertainment world.
Musician Ted Nugent has made a cottage industry
out of criticizing Obama, most
recently claiming that the president,
"represents everything bad about humanity."
Nugent was investigated by the Secret Service
after he made the bizarre claim that a second Obama victory would result in
the singer either being "dead or in jail."
