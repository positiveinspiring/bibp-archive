It is no secret that as the Fed's
centrally-planned New Normal has unfolded, one after another
central-planner and virtually all economists, have been caught wrong-footed
with their constant predictions of an "imminent" economic surge, any minute
now, and always just around the corner.
And yet,
nearly
six years after Lehman, five years after the end of the last
"recession" (even as the depression for most rages on), America is about to
have its worst quarter in decades (excluding the great financial crisis),
with a -2% collapse in GDP, which has been blamed on... the weather.
That's right: economists are the only people who will look anyone in the
eye, and suggest that it was harsh weather that smashed global trade,
pounded retail sales (in the process freezing the internet because people it
was so cold nobody shopped online), and even with soaring utility usage and
the Obamacare induced capital misallocation still led to world's largest
economy to a 5% plunge from initial estimates for 3% growth in Q1.
In other words, a delta of hundreds of
billion in "growth lost or uncreated" due to, well..., snow in the
winter.
Sadly for the same economists, now that Q2 is not shaping up to be much
better than Q1, other, mostly climatic, excuses have arisen: such as El
Ni√±o, the California drought, and even suggestions that, gasp..., as a
result of the Fed's endless meddling in the economy, the terminal growth
rate of the world has been permanently lowered to 2% or lower.
What is sadder for economists, even formerly respectable ones, is that
overnight it was none other than Tyler Cowen who,
writing in the New York Times, came up with
yet another theory to explain the,
"continuing slowness of economic growth in
high-income economies."
In his own words:
"An additional explanation of slow growth is
now receiving attention, however. It is the persistence and expectation
of peace."
That's right - blame it on the lack of war!
The world just hasn't had that much warfare
lately, at least not by historical standards.
Some of the recent headlines about Iraq or
South Sudan make our world sound like a very bloody place, but today's
casualties pale in light of the tens of millions of people killed in the
two world wars in the first half of the 20th century.
Even the Vietnam War had many more deaths
than any recent war involving an affluent country.
Well, that's just unacceptable: surely
all the world needs for some serious growth is for war casualties to be in
the billions, not in the paltry hundreds of thousands.
Keynesianism 101 continues:
Counterintuitive though it may sound, the
greater peacefulness of the world may make the attainment of higher
rates of economic growth less urgent and thus less likely.
This view does not claim that fighting wars
improves economies, as of course the actual conflict brings death and
destruction. The claim is also distinct from the Keynesian argument that
preparing for war lifts government spending and puts people to work.
Rather, the very possibility of war focuses
the attention of governments on getting some basic decisions right -
whether investing in science or simply liberalizing the economy.
Such focus ends up improving a nation's
longer-run prospects.
To be sure, Cowen is quick covers his ass with
some quick diplomacy.
After all how dare he implicitly suggest that
the only reason the US escaped the Great Depression is what some say was its
orchestrated entry into World War 2:
It may seem repugnant to find a positive
side to war in this regard, but a look at American history suggests we
cannot dismiss the idea so easily.
Fundamental innovations such as nuclear
power, the computer and the modern aircraft were all pushed along by an
American government eager to defeat the Axis powers or, later, to win
the Cold War.
The Internet was initially designed to help
this country withstand a nuclear exchange, and Silicon Valley had its
origins with military contracting, not today's entrepreneurial social
media start-ups.
The Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite
spurred American interest in science and technology, to the benefit of
later economic growth.
So what is it about war that makes economic
"growth" that much greater. Apparently it has to do with an urgency in
spending.
As in urgently spending more than the trillions
of dollars needed to support the US welfare state now, and spending even
more trillions in hopes of, you guessed it, stumbling on the next "Internet"
(which apparently wasn't created by
Al Gore).
War brings an urgency that governments
otherwise fail to summon.
For instance, the Manhattan Project took six
years to produce a working atomic bomb, starting from virtually nothing,
and at its peak consumed 0.4 percent of American economic output. It is
hard to imagine a comparably speedy and decisive achievement these days.
What we find surprising is that it took the
econofrauds this long to scapegoat that last falsifiable boundary - the lack
of war - for the lack of growth.
But they are finally stirring:
Ian Morris, a professor of classics and
history at Stanford, has revived the hypothesis that war is a
significant factor behind economic growth in his recent book, "War! What
Is it Good For? Conflict and the Progress of Civilization From Primates
to Robots."
Morris considers a wide variety of cases,
including the Roman Empire, the European state during its Renaissance
rise and the contemporary United States. In each case there is good
evidence that the desire to prepare for war spurred technological
invention and also brought a higher degree of internal social order.
Another new book, Kwasi Kwarteng's "War and Gold: A 500-Year History of
Empires, Adventures, and Debt," makes a similar argument but focuses on
capital markets.
Mr. Kwarteng, a Conservative member of
British Parliament, argues that the need to finance wars led governments
to help develop monetary and financial institutions, enabling the rise
of the West. He does worry, however, that today many governments are
abusing these institutions and using them to take on too much debt.
(Both Mr. Kwarteng and Mr. Morris are
extending themes from Azar Gat's 820-page magnum opus, "War in Human
Civilization," published in 2006.)
Yet another investigation of the hypothesis appears in a recent working
paper by the economists Chiu Yu Ko, Mark Koyama and Tuan-Hwee Sng. The
paper argues that Europe evolved as more politically fragmented than
China because China's risk of conquest from its western flank led it
toward political centralization for purposes of defense.
This centralization was useful at first but
eventually held China back. The European countries invested more in
technology and modernization, precisely because they were afraid of
being taken over by their nearby rivals.
The fun part will be when economists finally do
get their suddenly much desired war (just as they did with World War II, and
World War I before it, the catalyst for the creation of the Fed of course),
just as they got their much demanded trillions in monetary stimulus.
Recall that according to Krugman the Fed has
failed to stimulate the economy because it simply wasn't enough:
apparently having the Fed hold 35% of all 10
Year equivalents, injecting nearly $3 trillion in reserves into the
stock market, and creating a credit bubble that makes the 2007 debt
bubble pale by comparison was not enough.
One needs moar!
And so it will be with war. Because the first war will be blamed for having
been too small - it is time for a bigger war. Then an even bigger war. And
so on, until the most worthless human beings in existence - economists of
course - get their armageddon, resulting in the death of billions. Perhaps
only then will the much desired GDP explosion finally arrive?
Luckily for Cowen, he stops from advocating war as the ultimate panacea to a
slow growth (at least for now: once the US enters a recession with a nother
quarter of negative growth, one can only imagine what lunacy Krugman columns
will carry).
Instead he frames it as an issue of trade offs:
"We can prefer higher rates of economic
growth and progress, even while recognizing that recent G.D.P. figures
do not adequately measure all of the gains we have been enjoying. In
addition to more peace, we also have a cleaner environment (along most
but not all dimensions), more leisure time and a higher degree of social
tolerance for minorities and formerly persecuted groups.
Our more peaceful and - yes - more
slacker-oriented world is in fact better than our economic measures
acknowledge."
And let's not forget that GDP is nothing but
economic bullshit, confirmed when in recent weeks Europe - seemingly tired
of waiting for war - arbitrarily decided to add the "benefits" of
prostitution and narcotics.
And there you have all the meaningless growth
you can dream of. If only on paper.
Because hundreds of million of people in the
developed world, without a job, out of the labor force, can only be placated
with dreams of "hope and change" for so long. And certainly not once they
get hungry, or realize that the biggest lie of all in the Bismarckian
welfare state - guaranteed welfare - is long broke.
Cowen's conclusion:
Living in a largely peaceful world with 2
percent G.D.P. growth has some big advantages that you don't get with 4
percent growth and many more war deaths. Economic stasis may not feel
very impressive, but it's something our ancestors never quite managed to
pull off.
The real questions are whether we can do any
better, and whether the recent prevalence of peace is a mere temporary
bubble just waiting to be burst.
That's great. Now all we need is some economist
and/or central-planner who actually gets top billing and determines policy
to have a different conclusion, and decide that 4% growth is actually worth
m(b)illions of dead people.
Judging by recent events in Ukraine and the middle-east that announcement
may be just around the corner.
The Lack of Major Wars...
May Be Hurting Economic Growth

The continuing slowness of economic growth in high-income economies has
prompted soul-searching among economists. They have looked to weak demand,
rising inequality, Chinese competition, over-regulation, inadequate
infrastructure and an exhaustion of new technological ideas as possible
culprits.
An additional explanation of slow growth is now receiving attention,
however. It is the persistence and expectation of peace.
The world just hasn't had that much warfare lately, at least not by
historical standards. Some of the recent headlines about Iraq or South Sudan
make our world sound like a very bloody place, but today's casualties pale
in light of the tens of millions of people killed in the two world wars in
the first half of the 20th century. Even the Vietnam War had many more
deaths than any recent war involving an affluent country.
Counterintuitive though it may sound, the greater peacefulness of the world
may make the attainment of higher rates of economic growth less urgent and
thus less likely. This view does not claim that fighting wars improves
economies, as of course the actual conflict brings death and destruction.
The claim is also distinct from the Keynesian argument that preparing for
war lifts government spending and puts people to work.
Rather, the very
possibility of war focuses the attention of governments on getting some
basic decisions right - whether investing in science or simply liberalizing
the economy.
Such focus ends up improving a nation's longer-run prospects.
A Safer World
The number of people who have
died in wars has declined sharply since the 20th century:
It may seem repugnant to find a positive side to war in this regard, but a
look at American history suggests we cannot dismiss the idea so easily.
Fundamental innovations such as nuclear power,
the computer and the modern aircraft were all pushed along by an American
government eager to defeat the Axis powers or, later, to win the Cold War.
The Internet was initially designed to help this
country withstand a nuclear exchange, and Silicon Valley had its origins
with military contracting, not today's entrepreneurial social media
start-ups. The Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred American
interest in science and technology, to the benefit of later economic growth.
War brings an urgency that governments otherwise
fail to summon.
For instance, the
Manhattan Project took six
years to produce a working atomic bomb, starting from virtually nothing, and
at its peak
consumed
0.4 percent of American economic output. It is hard to imagine a
comparably speedy and decisive achievement these days.
As a teenager in the 1970s, I heard talk about
the desirability of rebuilding the Tappan Zee Bridge. Now, a replacement is
scheduled to open no earlier than 2017, at least -
provided that concerns about an endangered sturgeon can be addressed.
Kennedy Airport remains dysfunctional, and La
Guardia is hardly cutting edge, hobbling air transit in and out of New York.
The $800 billion stimulus bill, in response to the recession, has not
changed this basic situation.
Today the major slow-growing Western European
nations have very little fear of being taken over militarily, and thus their
politicians don't face extreme penalties for continuing stagnation. Instead,
losing office often means a boost in income from speaking or consulting fees
or a comfortable retirement in a pleasant vacation spot.
Japan, by comparison, is faced with territorial
and geopolitical pressures from China, and in response it is attempting a
national revitalization through the economic policies of Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe.
Ian Morris, a professor of classics and
history at Stanford, has revived the hypothesis that war is a significant
factor behind economic growth in
his recent
book, "War! What Is it Good For? Conflict and the Progress of
Civilization From Primates to Robots."

including the Roman Empire, the European state during its Renaissance rise
and the contemporary United States. In each case there is good evidence that
the desire to prepare for war spurred technological invention and also
brought a higher degree of internal social order.

Adventures, and Debt," makes a similar argument but focuses on capital
markets.

Mr. Morris are extending themes from Azar Gat's 820-page magnum opus, "War

Yet another investigation of the hypothesis
appears in
a recent working paper (Unified
China and Divided Europe) by the economists Chiu Yu Ko, Mark
Koyama and Tuan-Hwee Sng.
The paper argues that Europe evolved as
more politically fragmented than China because China's risk of conquest from
its western flank led it toward political centralization for purposes of
defense.
This centralization was useful at first but
eventually held China back. The European countries invested more in
technology and modernization, precisely because they were afraid of being
taken over by their nearby rivals.
But here is the catch:
Whatever the economic
benefits of potential conflict might have been, the calculus is different
today.
Technologies have become much more destructive, and so a large-scale
war would be a bigger disaster than before. That makes many wars less
likely, which is a good thing, but it also makes economic stagnation easier
to countenance.
There is a more optimistic read to all this than
may first appear. Arguably the contemporary world is trading some growth in
material living standards for peace - a relative paucity of war deaths and
injuries, even with a kind of associated laziness.
We can prefer higher rates of economic growth
and progress, even while recognizing that recent G.D.P. figures do not
adequately measure all of the gains we have been enjoying. In addition to
more peace, we also have a cleaner environment (along most but not all
dimensions), more leisure time and a higher degree of social tolerance for
minorities and formerly persecuted groups.
Our more peaceful and - yes - more
slacker-oriented world is in fact better than our economic measures

better, and whether the recent prevalence of peace is a mere temporary
bubble just waiting to be burst.
