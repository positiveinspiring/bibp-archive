The War on Iraq, filmmaker Robert Greenwald chronicles
the Bush
Administration's determined quest to invade Iraq following the events of
September 11, 2001.
The film deconstructs the administration's case
for war through interviews with,
-
U.S intelligence and defense officials
-
foreign service experts
-
U.N. weapons inspectors - including a former
CIA director
-
a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia
-
President Bush's
Secretary of the Army
Their analyses and conclusions are sobering, and
often disturbing, regardless of one's political affiliations.
This controversial and arresting film takes you
behind the walls of government, as CIA, Pentagon and foreign service experts
speak out, many for the first time, detailing the lies, misstatements and
exaggerations that served as the reasons to fight a "pre-emptive" war that
wasn't necessary.
This documentary offers an in-depth look at the
unsettling distortion of intelligence and the "spin and hype" presented to
the American people, the Congress and the press.
Fighting wars to bring about regime change is
in breach of international law.
Yet, throughout the fall of 2002, and into the
weeks preceding the war in Iraq, the Bush administration systematically
distorted intelligence evidence and misled the public in order to turn
opinion favor of "regime change" in Iraq.
The film will present interviews with more than 20 experts, all of whom have
informed opinions about the reasons we were given for war and the evidence
presented to support those reasons. Some supported the war itself but are
deeply concerned about the way information was misused. All believe it is
their duty to speak up.
Among those interviewed are:
-
former Ambassador Joe Wilson
-
weapons inspectors Scott Ritter and
David Albright
-
anti-terrorism expert Rand Beers
-
former CIA analyst Ray McGovern
-
former CIA operative Robert Baer
-
Washington editor of The Nation, David
Corn
