Paragould Police Chief
Stovall, left,
swears in reservists
last July.
"The fear is what's given us the reason to
do this, insisted
Todd Stovall, the head functionary of the paramilitary occupation
force afflicting
Paragould, Arkansas, as he announced that the city would be placed
under martial law for the supposed purpose of deterring crime.
Once I have stats and people are saying
they're scared, we can do this. It allows us to do what we're fixing to
do."
What Stovall and his fellow tax-feeders are
fixing to do is to leave the citys streets clotted with SWAT operators
toting AR-15s and official permission to harass anybody who comes within
eyeshot.
The marauders,
are going to be in SWAT gear and have
AR-15s around their neck, grunted Stovall at a town hall meeting held
last Thursday at the West View Baptist Church.
If youre out walking, were going to stop
you, ask why youre out walking, check for your ID.
Were going to do it to everybody, Stovall
explained, anticipating objections. Criminals dont like being talked
to.
The same is true
of citizens, of course - but like most members of his paramilitary tribe,
Stovall divides the world between enlightened agents of State authority
such as himself and the Mundane population, which is to be intimidated into
submission.
Stovall insists that constitutional quibbles
over probable cause dont apply, because the crisis justifies imposition
of a city-wide curfew and garrison state measures.
Ive got statistical reasons that say Ive
got a lot of crime right now, which gives me probable cause to ask what
youre doing out.
He admits that he didnt consult an attorney
before reaching that conclusion, and that,
I dont even know that theres ever been a
difference between what hes proposing and undisguised martial law.
To those who might complain about being harassed
by Stovalls minions, the chief offers an unqualified promise:
We have a zero-tolerance. We are prepared
to throw your hind-end in jail, OK? We are not going to take a lot of
flack.
Paragould historically has a very
high burglary rate, but the violent crime rate is substantially below the
national average:
In 2010, the last year for which stats are available,
there wasnt a single murder in the town of roughly 26,000 people.
But political elites and their enforcers are
adept at manufacturing fears, and the bullet-headed militarist who heads the
police department - and
appears to be building his own little private army - assumes that
government derives its "just" powers from whatever fears it can instill and
exploit in its subjects.
