Astounding hypocrisy, self-censorship, and
complicity by the West
regarding one of the most regressive regimes on
Earth.
The Cooperation Council for the Arab States
of the Gulf (GCC)
comprises of 6 nations,
-
Saudi Arabia
-
Qatar
-
Bahrain
-
Kuwait
-
the United Arab Emirates
-
Oman
In principle, Kuwait and Bahrain are considered
"constitutional monarchs;" in practice, all 6 are despotic autocracies with
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman overtly "absolute
monarchs."
Devoid of even a feigned semblance of
representative governance, these regimes brutally repress not only their own
subjects, but play active roles in repressing the people of other nations,
both on their borders and well beyond them.
Saudi Arabia and Qatar are playing an active
role in crushing dissent in neighboring Bahrain - an opaque uprising
obscured by a lack of Western media coverage - apparently the result of
Western press houses conveniently ignoring unrest targeting governments
linked to Western interests, while intentionally subverting nations opposed
to Western interests.
A map of the GCC's members, a collection of
interconnected absolute monarchies guilty of serial
crimes against humanity both at home and abroad, for
decades.
We are now expected to believe this criminal
collaboration is promoting "democracy" in both Libya
and now Syria by sending in legions of armed
sectarian militants, when not even a feigned
semblance of democracy exists within their own
borders.
Likewise, the collective efforts of the GCC's
regimes have torn North Africa's nation of Libya apart, leaving it under the
control of
roving bands of NATO/GCC-armed and funded
genocidal sectarian militants with the Tripoli government
dominated by Western proxies.
A similar operation is now underway in Syria,
also fully funded, armed, and directed by
the GCC and its Western minders.
The term "pro-democracy" has been disingenuously used to describe the
militant legions that very "undemocratic" nations like Saudi Arabia and
Qatar are underwriting.
Clearly, even at face value, this is an
untenable narrative. Under closer scrutiny, it unravels further, exposing a
criminal, murderously violent, terroristic conspiracy of vast international
proportions.
Of the GCC, perhaps the two most prominent members are Saudi Arabia and
Qatar, with the House of Saud leading, and the Qataris playing a supporting
role, mainly in terms of propaganda via
state-owned Al Jazeera, by hosting
"defectors," and hosting the regional headquarters of Western
corporate-financier funded think-tanks like the
Brookings Institution's Doha Centre.
Saudi Arabia - 10
Truths Self-Censored by the West's Media Houses
-
Saudi Arabia is so utterly autocratic it
is literally named after the ruling dynasty, the House of Saud. Thus
it is Arabia of the House of Saud, or "Saudi Arabia."
-
To this day, Saudi Arabia carries out
barbaric executions against both criminals and political enemies,
including victims
accused of "sorcery and witchcraft"
in the aptly named, "Chop-Chop
Square" located in the capital of Riyadh where heads are
literally chopped off by hooded swordsmen.
-
Women are banned from driving in Saudi
Arabia, and most likely would also be banned from voting in national
elections, if such a phenomenon even occurred -
which it does not - as Saudi Arabia
is an absolute monarchy and its leaders are determined by heredity,
not even the feigned pretense of elections. There are local
elections, however, in which
woman are not permitted to vote
(perhaps in 2015?).
-
Saudi Arabia has been and to this day is
the
primary underwriter of the
notorious international terror organization, Al Qaeda.
Created along with Saudi Arabia's long-time
ally, the United States, money, weapons, and directives
are
laundered through the Saudis to
maintain both plausible deniability for the Americans, and to
maintain a degree of credibility for Al Qaeda's sectarian extremist
foot-soldiers across the Muslim World.
-
Saudi Arabia maintains an extensive
"re-education"
program internationally to pervert the tenets of Islam as
a means of keeping Al Qaeda's ranks full and fueling Wall Street and
London's engineered "Clash
of Civilizations."
-
Saudi Arabian corporate-financier
interests (run by the royal family) are tied directly to Wall Street
and London via conglomerations like the
US-Saudi Arabian Business Council
and representation upon the JP Morgan International Council (Khalid
Al-Falih of Saudi Aramco, amongst the highest valued
companies on Earth).
-
The alleged most notorious terrorist in
modern history, Osama Bin Laden, was a creation of US-Saudi
machinations, with
the Bin Laden family to this day
being a premier member of of both Saudi and Western elitist circles.
The multi-billion dollar
Saudi Binladin Group is an active
member of the US-Saudi Arabian Business Council and plays a central
role in deciding bilateral policy for the benefit of collective
US-Saudi corporate-financier and corresponding geopolitical
interests.
-
The autocratic
House of Saud maintains Al Arabiya,
along with a extensive list of unsavory investors from across the
GCC and its sphere of influence, including Lebanon's Hariri faction.
It is a propaganda outlet masquerading as an objective journalistic
organization, working in tandem with state-owned Al Jazeera in
Qatar. Occasionally admitted to be "state media" by the West, "state
media" in Saudi Arabia actually means "Saud family-owned
propaganda."
-
Saudi Arabia has played an active role
in the violent destabilization of governments around the world,
including most recently
Libya and
Syria. The use of
sectarian-extremists indoctrinated at Saudi-funded faux-mosques and
madrasas, armed and funded by Saudi cash, is the standard method of
operation for these destabilizations.
-
Saudi Arabia's brutally repressive
internal security apparatus is
a creation of US advisers and operators.
Its military, both covert and conventional, is also armed through
astronomically large weapons sales (including a recent sale
considered
the largest in US history) by its
Wall Street and London allies. The atrocities committed by the
despotic Saud regime are directly facilitated by US advisers,
operators, and arms. Saudi Arabia also hosts the US military, a
sizable force until it was spread out amongst the orbiting despotic
regimes of
Qatar,
Bahrain,
Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.
Of course, not everyone in Saudi Arabia is a
barbaric, treasonous, meddling despot.
This includes people all across Saudi Arabia's
population of 28 million and even throughout its government. Many of these
people have attempted to protest or reform the current state of the
"kingdom," albeit very unsuccessfully.
This failure can be in part blamed on the vast, draconian police state
created for the House of Saud despots by their Western sponsors as well as a
Western media complicit in censoring crackdowns on protesters,
most recently unfolding in the eastern city
of Qatif, and a virtual media "black hole" in regards to covering anything,
good or bad, regarding Saudi Arabia.
The key to breaking this self-imposed Western media blockade is for the
alternative media to conduct the research and cover developments themselves.
This includes reaching out to activists and
reformers within Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the other GCC autocracies and
giving the people the platform denied to them by the corporate-funded
Western media.
The Fortune 500 has an array of
faux-human rights
organizations from North Africa to the
Middle East, from Eastern Europe to East Asia -
perhaps it is time for people to begin organizing
themselves into independent institutions that truly
defend human rights and freedom, while implementing
an agenda of the majority.
A possible "International
Observatory for Gulf State Despotism"
would seek to break the Western media's blockade on
information regarding the GCC, serving as a
clearinghouse for information on abuses, repression,
and meddling both at home and abroad.
NOTE
If you are from the GCC region, please contact
LD at cartalucci@gmail.com with any information, issues, corrections or
concerns. There may be a possible "International
Observatory for Gulf State Despotism" created specifically to
give voices to the people under the rule of the GCC.
Please exercise good judgment and caution - as
these are real despots and have put many people to death for questioning
their undisputed rule or opposing the progress of their medieval
machinations.
