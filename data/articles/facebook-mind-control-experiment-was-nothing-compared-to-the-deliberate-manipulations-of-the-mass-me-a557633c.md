The internet erupted in protest last week over the revelation that
Facebook
ran a psychological experiment on 700,000 users designed to see just how
easily information could be used to manipulate their emotions.
"Facebook's
ill-advised psychological experiment is alarming because it suggests that
the Internet, in the wrong hands, can be a powerful weapon to subtly
manipulate public opinion and promote a political agenda,"
wrote David
Einstein of SFgate.com.
Everyone else chimed in with similar condemnations:
-
The Wall Street Journal
-
ZDNet
-
CNN
-
USA Today,
...and more.
Messing with the emotions of people in a
"grand social experiment" was wrong, they insisted.
But hold the presses for a second. Facebook may have run a mind control
experiment on 700,000 people, but
the mainstream media plays mind games on
tens of millions every single day.
Every minute spent watching any mainstream media news program - CNN, Fox
News, etc. - is a minute spent enduring a massive mind control experiment
that has been played out on the public for decades.
And what experiment is
being played out, exactly?
It depends on which brainwashing network you're
tuned into.
CNN brainwashing runs
24/7
If you watch CNN, then you're being brainwashed into believing Big
Government is always good, Constitutionalists are paranoid radicals, and
Obama is a god-like savior.
If you watched Fox News in 2001 after
the 9/11
attacks, you were being brainwashed into believing Bush was our savior, war
was a fun "sport" to watch with pizza and beer, and vengeance was morally
justified because all those "evildoers" destroyed the Twin Towers.
(Never mind that the real evildoers were never
publicly identified.
The war had already been justified in the minds of the
masses...)
Facebook is playing Tiddly Winks compared to the mass social engineering
conducted by the mainstream media every single day. The same media that's
telling you Facebook should be condemned for playing with your head is
rewiring your reality day in and day out.
You think you're watching the
news, but you're actually watching an elaborate theatrical production being
played out on a global stage.
Don't believe me? Watch this totally fabricated CNN broadcast from the first
Gulf War, not quite pulled off by CNN reporter Charles Jaco:
The entire broadcast was utterly fabricated, yet
it was broadcast as if it were real news "live from Saudi Arabia."
CNN, of course, has become a lot more sophisticated since then, mastering
the art of broadcasting fake news that viewers increasingly believe to be
real.
Mainstream media mind
control puts the Facebook experiment to shame
Almost everything the masses think they know was implanted into their heads
by the mainstream media.
These include all the following outright lies which
have been absorbed by the brainwashed masses:
-
Drinking fluoride is good for your
teeth. (Lie)
-
Health care in America was made
"affordable" by Obamacare. (Lie)
-
There is no radiation problem
with
Fukushima.
-
Anyone critical of President
Obama is
automatically a racist.
-
Vaccines always work and have
zero side
effects or risks.
-
Your
money is safe in the bank. (It
isn't)
-
You are stupid to buy gold. Keep your
holdings in dollars. (Because somebody has to ride the collapse all
the way down...)
-
People who think critically about the
corruption and failures of government are "anti-government
extremists." (They aren't)
-
TV news can be trusted because it looks
really cool on screen. (Teleprompters mean all the news is
scripted.)
-
The Federal Reserve is part of the
federal government. (It isn't)
-
The FDA keeps the food supply safe and
protects the interests of consumers like you.
-
The greatest threat to America is "home
grown terrorism." (It isn't. The greatest threat is unrestrained
executive power leading to a dictatorship that commits mass murder
against the People. North Korea, anyone?)
-
Local police departments need more
armored assault vehicles to "keep your communities safe." (Since
when was the 'burbs a war zone?)
-
Processed food is good for your babies,
especially infant formula made with over 50% corn syrup. (Because
babies can never have enough corn syrup, you see.)
-
Drug companies care about humanity, and
their high prices are necessary for more innovation to save lives.
(Never mind the FDA-enforced monopolistic drug prices that create a
high-profit protection racket.)
Truth-tellers are
fired from mainstream media
I could go on, but you get the point:
An utterly false network of beliefs
has long been pounded into the heads of nearly every American through the
mainstream media's elaborate (and incessant) mind warping theatrical
productions.
Notice, too, that anyone who dares to tell the truth about the real world
gets fired from their jobs.
Judge Andrew Napolitano, for example, was booted
from Fox News when his opinion speech on the importance of protecting the
Constitution simply became too much for the network's corporate fairytale
weavers to bear.
MSNBC, at the same time, won't hire anyone to be on air unless their résumé
is stamped in big red letters, "CLINICALLY INSANE." That's why almost every
person featured on MSNBC already has one foot in the loony bin (and the
other foot in their mouth).
So where can you find real news?
In the alternative media where real voices come
from real people who can't be fired because they have no bosses. It does not
have all fancy TV sets and
teleprompter-reading supermodels, but they tell the truth.
And that's probably why the lying mainstream
media continues to lose viewers while the alternative media keeps surging in
popularity.
Welcome to the real world...
