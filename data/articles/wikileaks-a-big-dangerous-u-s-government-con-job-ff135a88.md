The story on the surface makes for a script for
a new Oliver Stone Hollywood thriller.
A 39-year old Australian hacker holds the
President of the United States and his State Department hostage to a
gigantic cyber leak, unless the President leaves Julian Assange and
his Wikileaks free to release hundreds of thousands of pages of sensitive US
Government memos.
A closer look at the details, so far carefully
leaked by the most ultra-establishment of international media such as the
New York Times, reveals a clear agenda. That agenda coincidentally serves to
buttress the agenda of US geopolitics around the world from Iran to Russia
to North Korea. The Wikileaks is a big and dangerous US intelligence Con
Job which will likely be
used to police the Internet.
It is almost too perfectly-scripted to be true. A discontented 22-year old
US Army soldier on duty in Baghdad, Bradley Manning, a low-grade US
Army intelligence analyst, described as a loner, a gay in the military, a
disgruntled computer geek, sifts through classified information at Forward
Operating Base Hammer.
He decides to secretly download US State
Department email communications from the entire world over a period of eight
months for hours a day, onto his blank CDs while pretending to be listening
to Lady Gaga. In addition to diplomatic cables, Manning is believed to have
provided WikiLeaks with helicopter gun camera video of an errant US attack
in Baghdad on unarmed journalists, and with war logs from Iraq and
Afghanistan.
Manning then is supposed to have tracked down a notorious former US computer
hacker to get his 250,000 pages of classified US State Department cables out
in the Internet for the whole world to see.
He allegedly told the US hacker that the
documents he had contained,
"incredible, awful things that belonged in
the public domain and not on some server stored in a dark room in
Washington, DC."
The hacker turned him in to US authorities so
the story goes.
Manning is now incommunicado since months in US
military confinement so we cannot ask him, conveniently. The Pentagon
routinely hires the best hackers to design their security systems.
Then the plot thickens. The 250,000 pages end up at the desk of Julian
Assange, the 39-year-old Australian founder of a supposedly
anti-establishment website with the cute name Wikileaks.
Assange decides to selectively choose several of
the worlds most ultra-establishment news media to exclusively handle the
leaking job for him as he seems to be on the run from Interpol, not for
leaking classified information, but for allegedly having consensual sex with
two Swedish women who later decided it was rape.
He selects as exclusive newspapers to decide what is to be leaked the New
York Times which did such service in promoting faked propaganda against
Saddam that led to the Iraqi war, the London Guardian and Der Spiegel.
Assange claims he had no time to sift through so
many pages so handed them to the trusted editors of the establishment media
for them to decide what should be released. Very anti-establishment that.
The New York Times even assigned one of its top
people, David E. Sanger, to control the release of the Wikileaks
material. Sanger is no establishment outsider.
He sits as a member of the elite
Council on Foreign Relations as well as the Aspen Institute
Strategy Group together with the likes of Condi Rice, former Defense
Secretary William Perry, former CIA head John Deutch, former
State Department Deputy Secretary and now World Bank head Robert Zoellick
among others.
Indeed a strange choice of media for a person who claims to be
anti-establishment.
But then Assange also says he believes the US
Government version of 9/11 and calls
the Bilderberg Group a normal meeting of
people, a very establishment view.
Not so secret cables
The latest sensational Wikileaks documents allegedly from the US State
Department embassies around the world to Washington are definitely not as
Hillary Clinton claimed,
"an attack on America's foreign policy
interests that have endangered innocent people."
And they do not amount to what the Italian
foreign minister, called the "September 11 of world diplomacy."
The British government calls them a threat to
national security and an aide to Canadas Prime Minister calls on the CIA to
assassinate Assange, as does kooky would-be US Presidential hopeful Sarah
Palin.
Most important, the 250,000 cables are not "top secret" as we might have
thought.
Between two and three million US Government
employees are cleared to see this level of "secret" document,[1]
and some 500,000 people around the world have access to the Secret
Internet Protocol Network (SIPRnet)
where the cables were stored.
SIPRnet is not recommended for distribution of
top-secret information. Only 6% or 15,000 pages of the documents have been
classified as even secret, a level below top-secret. Another 40% were the
lowest level, "confidential", while the rest were unclassified. In brief, it
was not all that secret.[2]
Most of the revelations so far have been unspectacular.
In Germany the revelations led to the removal of
a prominent young FDP politician close to Guido Westerwelle who
apparently liked to talk too much to his counterpart at the US Embassy. The
revelations about Russian politics, that a US Embassy official refers to
Putin and Medvedev as Batman and Robin, tells more about the cultural
level of current US State Department personnel than it does about internal
Russian politics.
But for anyone who has studied the craft of intelligence and of
disinformation, a clear pattern emerges in the Wikileaks drama.
The focus is put on select US geopolitical
targets, appearing as Hillary Clinton put it to justify US sanctions
against Iran. They claim North Korea with Chinas granting of free passage
to Korean ships despite US State Department pleas, send dangerous missiles
to Iran.
Saudi Arabias ailing King Abdullah reportedly
called Irans President a Hitler.
Excuse to police the
Internet?
What is emerging from all the sound and Wikileaks fury in Washington is that
the entire scandal is serving to advance a long-standing Obama and Bush
agenda of policing the until-now free Internet.
Already the US Government has shut the Wikileaks
server in the United States though no identifiable US law has been broken.
The process of policing the Web was well underway before the current leaks
scandal. In 2009 Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller and Republican
Olympia Snowe introduced the
Cybersecurity Act of 2009 (S.773).
It would give the President unlimited power to
disconnect private-sector computers from the internet.
The bill "would allow the president to
'declare a cyber-security emergency' relating to 'non-governmental'
computer networks and do what's necessary to respond to the threat."
We can expect that now this controversial piece
of legislation will get top priority when a new Republican House and the
Senate convene in January.
The US Department of Homeland Security, an agency created in the political
hysteria following
9/11 2001 that has been compared to the
Gestapo, has already begun policing the Internet. They are quietly seizing
and shutting down internet websites (web domains) without due process or a
proper trial.
DHS simply seizes web domains that it wants to
and posts an ominous "Department of Justice" logo on the web site.
See an example at
http://torrent-finder.com:
Over 75 websites were seized and shut in a
recent week.
Right now, their focus is websites that they
claim "violate copyrights," yet the torrent-finder.com website that was
seized by DHS contained no copyrighted content whatsoever.
It was merely a search engine website that
linked to destinations where people could access copyrighted content. Step
by careful step, freedom of speech can be taken away.
Then what?
