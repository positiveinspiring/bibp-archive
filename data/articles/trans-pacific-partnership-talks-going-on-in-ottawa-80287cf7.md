Trade officials from Canada and other
Asia-Pacific nations are meeting behind closed doors in Ottawa to
discuss
the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a
massive free-trade proposal that could create one of the world's largest
trading blocks.
The TPP currently comprises 12 countries,
including,
-
Canada
-
Australia
-
Brunei
-
Chile
-
Japan
-
Malaysia
-
Mexico
-
New Zealand
-
Peru
-
Singapore
-
the United States
-
Vietnam
The discussions between trade officials are
taking place in Ottawa from July 3 to 12.
Federal ministers are not participating in
the talks.
"No ministerial meeting will occur on
the margin of the officials' meeting in Ottawa," said Claude Rochon,
a spokesman for the department of Foreign Affairs.
"This is a working-level technical
meeting, held by the TPP negotiating leads and a small number of
focused working groups, that meet as required to continue to advance
negotiations."
Canada
first joined discussions surrounding
the mammoth trade proposal in October 2012.
Secrecy 'unacceptable'
The federal government says TPP countries
represent 792 million people and a combined GDP of $28.1 trillion
dollars. One of the major complaints from opposition parties is the
secrecy surrounding the talks.
NDP trade critic Don Davies said the
process has been "unacceptable" and Canada should "aspire to higher
standards" when dealing with "profoundly important" discussions. In an
interview with CBC News, Davies said the government could provide
periodic updates to lift the veil on the closed-door discussions.
Liberal John McCallum agrees.
He said his party is keen on expanding
Canada's trade relationships, but more information should be provided.
"For starters, they could tell us who is
negotiating for us," McCallum said.
The Council of Canadians, which calls itself
a social-action organization, has suggested the process,
"The Canadian government claims that
'interested stakeholders have an opportunity to provide their views
related to Canada's interests in the TPP,' but it won't release even
the most basic information to allow for stakeholder access to
negotiators as has happened at previous rounds," said Scott Harris,
a trade campaigner for the group.
There has also been concern from groups,
including the Dairy Farmers of Canada, about how the trade deal could
increase access to
the Canadian dairy market.
