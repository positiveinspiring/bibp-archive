Bruce Campbell, director of the
CGIAR
Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)
is interested in South Asian farmers reducing,
"the amount of water
needed for their rice crops by 25 to 30%" to facilitate a new
climate-smart revolution
(CSR) to agriculture.
CGIAR is focused on bringing the ideals of CSR,
as promoted by
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) who claims
that in the next 30 years,
"world population will require a 60 percent
increase in total agricultural production" due to overpopulation and
destruction by man-made climate change.
The approach afforded by a CSR is outlined with
3 clear objectives such as:
-
Sustainably increasing agricultural
productivity, to support equitable increases in farm incomes, food
security and development
-
Adapting and building resilience of
agricultural and food security systems to climate change at multiple
levels
-
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from
agriculture (including crops, livestock and fisheries)
To ensure the agricultural future of the entire
world, Ban Ki-moon, general secretary of the UN, announced the formation of
the
Global
Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture
(GACSA) to coerce,
"500 million
farmers, fishers, pastoralists, livestock keepers and foresters" into
adopting "climate smart practices" in order to remain viable in emerging
global markets.
The GACSA is focused on making sure,
"food
production can survive amidst much higher temperatures and far more frequent
encounters with drought, flooding and violent storms."
Part of this scheme includes the use of
genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) in the general food supply.
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT)
maintain that GMOs will allow farmers of the future to grow crops
without worrying about the changes to the climate or weather patterns.
As CGAIR and the UN assert, by 2030 the
practicality of feeding and estimated 2.4 billion humans tacked on to the
alleged 7.5 billion is a challenge being postulated today with research into
how to perfect tools and techniques of the burgeoning CSA.
Two years ago, the FAO
stated that
farmers globally have,
"weve not been producing as much as we are consuming.
That is why stocks are being run down. Supplies are now very tight across
the world and reserves are at a very low level, leaving no room for
unexpected events next year."
In fact since 2010, the have
stated that the rise in food prices is directly correlated to the 80
million people being added to the worlds population annually.
This fact,
according to the globalists at the UN, is beginning to,
"tax both the skills
of farmers and the limits of the earths land and water resources."
Indeed,
the World Bank (WB) issued a similar
statement on the for the coming food shortage due to the drought devastating
the US and Europe.
According to Jim Yong Kim, World
Bank group president:
"Food prices rose again sharply threatening the health
and well-being of millions of people. Africa and the Middle East are
particularly vulnerable, but so are people in other countries where the
prices of grains have gone up abruptly."
With an estimated 870 million people in the
Middle East and Africa becoming malnourished, world environmentalists are
saying that the global food supply system is heading toward collapse.
Lester Brown, president of the
Earth Policy Institute (EPI), asserts that our planets climate can no
longer be trusted and that the demand for food from over-population is
breaking the proverbial straw on the camels back.
Brown says that,
"food shortages undermined
earlier civilizations. We are on the same path. Each country is now fending
for itself. The world is living one year to the next."
Brown
predicts that as "food supplies are tightening everywhere" and
agricultural land is becoming a precious commodity, geopolitical perspective
will shift from energy to necessity.
He foretells of "armed aggression"
focused on "food unrest".
With the assistance of the UN, corporations have
begun
descending on Africa
to aid in the securitization of their natural
resources.
Examples like an $11 million dollar project
funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the
Coca-Cola
Corporation are usurping 50,000 Kenyan and Ugandan smallholders to produce
fruit for
Minute Maid, a subsidiary for Coca-Cola.
"Africa is now the last frontier in terms of
arable land," said James Nyoro, the Rockefeller Foundations managing
director for Africa. "With the population growing to 9 billion, the rest of
the world will have to depend upon Africa to feed it."
According to a 2011
report released by the International Land Coalition, there is a rush by
global networks to acquire land in the sub-Saharan region of Africa by
foreign corporations and governments which is causing environmental and
agricultural devastation along the River Niger in Africa.
The report states:
"The siphoning of water for
huge areas of farmland will worsen the already low water levels of the
Niger."
The outcome was a,
"50 percent diminution of the delta flood plains
land area.
Given that social conflict over resources between farmers and
pastoralists has always been a feature of the Niger Basin, the Coalition
suggests that large-scale irrigation could heighten tension between local
and downstream water users."
