WHAT: A pre-planned collapse of the US (and global) financial and
economic systems.
-
WHO: The same characters who perpetrated the original 911.
-
WHERE: New York City & DC, of course. Plus a sideshow in Washington
state.
-
WHEN: The days surrounding September 11, naturally.
-
HOW: Instead of painted drones, missiles with wings & big fins, and fake
airplanes, they used the much more stealthy short seller.
-
WHY: To remake the economic/financial order of the world into a "PPP".
-
WHY Really: Think about it ! And then ask yourself, "Cui bono?"
The 911 blueprint worked so magically for the
world controllers that they were compelled to use virtually the same
playbook.
"If it isn't broke, why fix it?"
So, what's the real deal here?
By analogy, let's take a quick look at the 911 timeline and stack it up
against the new 2008 Financial "911", as it began to unfold earlier this
year.
-
The Bear Stearns collapse that began in
March 2008 is analogous to the 1st World Trade Center bombing in
1993. Just a warm up. This was preceded by a little failure back in
January featuring Countrywide the largest US mortgage lender.
-
The nationalization of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac marks the beginning of the new 911. Both in the DC area,
they were the first to come down this time. Just as they struck at
the heart of the military complex, this time they went for the
jugular of the national real estate market. Remember this is a
financial 911.
-
Next came this year's version of the
twin towers, building 7 and other assorted NYC landmarks in the form
of Lehman Brothers, AIG, Merrill Lynch, as well as Morgan Stanley
and Goldman Sachs in their "new & improved" form. Basically took out
the whole of American investment brokerage, heh?!
-
And, of course, we still have Washington
Mutual out there in the boonies just like the one that "crashed" in
a PA farm field. Update: WashMu is now history! As is another
"little" bank by the name of Wachovia.
-
Their MO! What else, but controlled
demolition? Throughout 2008, and especially this month of September,
we have seen some of the world's largest banks, brokerage houses,
mortgage lenders, insurance companies and investment brokers go
bust, as each of them fell perfectly into their own footprint faster
than you can say: C O N T R O L L E D D E M O L I T I O N ! ! !
-
The 700 billion dollar Bailout Plan is
just like the Patriot Act, isn't it? Only this time it's maybe a 1
or 2 page document (in its original form) that conferred absolute
authority on the Executive Branch to do just about anything they
want with the taxpayer's money. And they want it rubber stamped now.
Not tomorrow. NOW!!! Without discussion, or unnecessary
congressional debate. Talk about Shock & Awe being used against the
American people, and their elected representatives!?! "The Greatest
Depression" never sounded more like "Weapons of Mass Destruction",
eh?!?!
-
Now we know we can expect further
gyrations, panics and precipitous declines in the market and
elsewhere, just as we had anthrax attacks in the Capital, beltway
snipers in Maryland in October of '02, the 3/11/04 train bombings in
Madrid, and the 7/7/05 bombings in London. Not to mention the 50+
other synthetic terror events staged throughout the world to enforce
compliance and create distraction.
-
The sudden and dramatic downfall of NY
Gov Eliot Spitzer can also now be seen in its proper light. Having
left the reservation one too many times, he simply could not be
trusted to go with the flow. He had their numbers, their signatures
(especially their MO's), their addresses --- the whole ball of wax,
as well as his own reputation to burnish. Eliot, to seal his fate,
wrote a masterful expose on the subprime mortgage fiasco/fraud that
was published in the WashPo just weeks before his public
humiliation. He had recently testified before Congress in fine
revelatory fashion as well. The elimination of John O'Neil, Head of
Security at the WTC complex, is quite similar, except that John O.
a great patriot died on 911, having just been given the job.
-
To date, the most obvious and glaring
example of this manipulated takedown is the case of a NY Senator.
His letter to the FDIC contained confidential information that
triggered the IndyMac bank collapse in July. California AG Jerry
Brown was called to review the entire affair after the OTS Director
explicitly blamed the letter for causing a run on the bank (3rd
largest bank failure in US history). This episode is eerily
reminiscent of Larry Silverstein's order to, "Pull it." just prior
to the expertly controlled demolition of Building # 7on 911.
-
Just as 911 was perpetrated as a cover
for: inaugurating the War on Terror, overtly advancing the NWO
regime globally (in contrast to this previously covert operation),
imposing a police state (Homeland Security) in the US (by gutting
the US Constitution), UK and elsewhere, dominating and securing
oil/gas reserves in the Middle East and Cacaucus (to include running
energy pipelines through Afghanistan and stealing Iraq's oil wealth
via military invasion), jump starting the Afghan opium trade, etc.,
the ECO/FIN 911 of '08 is a cover for many of these same agenda
items. However, there is one little item that is particularly high
on the current agenda. And that concerns the derivatives market,
which in its totality approximates somewhere between 750 trillion
and 1 quadrillion dollars of instruments as of 2008. In fact, the
sub prime mortgage defaults are just a tip of the tip of the iceberg
when compared to the real megilla DERIVATIVES. This is what
they're really worried about, and having to cover for. Except this
is a quadrillion dollar megilla that can't be covered without
unraveling the entire capitalistic system, and its fascist
corpocracy and kleptocratic oligarchy.
-
And then there is the teenie-weenie
matter concerning the Federal Reserve, and its collection agency
the IRS. The man standing behind this curtain has a lot at stake,
especially in the form of mountains of evidence that will indict,
and convict, the entire system. Lots of evidence was destroyed
during and after 911, as will happen after many of these Wall Street
firms are taken over, nationalized, liquidated, merged and
disappeared. The veil, however, has already been lifted.
Does anyone see a pattern here?!
The real lesson to be gleaned from this analysis is that events of such
enormity and consequence are rarely spontaneous and unchoreographed.
Especially when they happen just weeks from an era defining presidential
election. They have obviously been planning this one for a long time, and it
has been fastidiously engineered to have a very definite effect and desired
outcome a permanent planetary plantation (PPP).
The execution, thus far, has been flawless. Even for those of us who stood
there on the 1st 911, and knew it was a fraud while the buildings were
coming down, this one is exceedingly more difficult to penetrate.
However,
penetrate we will, until every last conspirator is sitting before the TRUTH
AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION spillin' the beans. The ultimate and lasting
effect of these inquiries will be a
New World Order of our making, not
theirs. The only remaining, $64,000 question will undoubtedly be, "What do
we do with them after we head them off at the pass?"
For the uninitiated, it may take quite a lot to wrap your mind around this
extremely complex and convoluted plot, but, please, just be patient. As this
drama plays out, the true intentions of the primary perpetrators will become
manifest as they unwittingly reveal themselves by their handiwork.
As Eliot Spitzer, no - Eliot Ness, nee
Sherlock Holmes once alluded to a fingerprint inadvertently left as
evidence is impossible to erase.
You see, the short sellers, unlike the "airplanes", are still with us. Each
one had a target to take down which they did with amazing speed and
dexterity. And the myriad transactions that converged to topple their prey
are all preserved somewhere, in some huge database, with multiple backups to
serve as confirmation of trades of staggering amounts. AHHH!
Nothing like computers, especially when they're
not confiscated and shipped off to China for permanent disposal.
May all financial wizards and economic soothsayers, henceforth, be inspired
to stare into their crystal ball and divine the upcoming financial and
economic events of global proportions with the keenest of acumen and
sleuthing. As we shine the LIGHT of our collective awareness on these
rapidly unfolding schemes, we will serve as beacons of revelation, and hope
to the world.
Remember we now know the script. We know the major players involved. We
know their MO: Controlled Demolition.
We are able to watch the crimes being
committed in real time. Each of us has now been thusly notified, and
empowered, to serve as a vector of dissemination of this critical
information.
So -----> LET'S GET BUSY ! ! !
Special Message to the Market Oracles and Money Masters of the Universe
Our "PRE-PLANNED" scenario delineated above in no way ignores the true state
of the national economy, international finance or global economic picture.
In fact we are, and have been, fully cognizant of the fact that the true
state of every market real estate, equity, bond, commodities, currency,
derivative, etc. has been in shambles for many years, just waiting for the
Perfect Storm to come around and blow it all away.
It has been obvious to many of us that each of these markets have operated
according to the whim of a very few individuals with extremely concentrated
power to manipulate. Therefore, all markets can be artificially inflated, as
we have seen time and time again. Likewise, they can be artificially
deflated, sometimes rather quickly for effect, as we have seen.
"The
Invisible Hand" of the market is just that a very carefully hidden hand
that makes a complete and total mockery of every economic and financial
theory ever advanced. Time for a lot of us to accept this fact of modern
economic life.
Perhaps we should now take off our blinders and admit that while, yes, all
of the indicators are, and have been, there for a catastrophic economic
meltdown & financial cataclysm, these events are still completely
controllable. All of us have seen bubble after bubble grow and balloon, and
merge and overlap, and inextricably interpenetrate each other, until all we
have is one massive bubble ready to pop.
But, when will it pop?!
It will pop when the confidence level is
sufficiently undermined by the very same
MEDIA that controls the flow of the
relevant information. And who, pray tell, controls the media, if not The
Invisible Hand? Clearly, the real Market Oracles are not a part of that MSM
juggernaut. Therefore, it is incumbent upon each oracle to get it right,
since they are the very best sources of pertinent financial and economic
data/information.
The inevitability of self destructive capitalism does not preclude the
process of controlled destruction. As the system eats itself, there are
those who are eaten, and those who eat. We are witnessing this devolution in
living color, as we both write and read these words. The "strong" at the top
of the pyramid have always done the eating, as the "weak" at the bottom
provide the bone for the stew. The only major difference at this particular,
and final, feast is that the internet has allowed for an unprecedented
explosion of true and accurate information in real time. Therefore, the
playing field has been leveled like never before.
The little guy or gal, for
the first time ever, has the opportunity to take back a little, or a lot, of
his/her power (WEALTH), should he/she so choose.
Even as the Wall Street gangs team up with the opportunistic political
class, as well as the numerous corporate/legal jackals and lobby parasites,
to effectuate the most massive redistribution of wealth (aka in your face
THEFT) in recorded history, something has profoundly and fundamentally
changed. There is a dynamic at work which can alter the game just enough to
potentially turn the pyramid upside down.
This, however, requires a no nonsense, "look in
the mirror with raw honesty" approach. Then we (the oracles) will not deign
to render a judgment that is not fully baked. And the recommendations we
make are more likely to be issued in the best interest of ALL, especially
for those who are in a position of class disadvantage, financial ignorance
or structured powerlessness.
So, we have made it clear that all the forces have been put into place for
the upcoming monetary apocalypse. But even these forces are controlled, each
and every one of them, all the way up to the top. It's probably a very good
time to contemplate just who it is that resides at the peak of the global
financial decision-making process.
And, their agenda ?!?
HINT: Let's get serious for a moment. Most of us know by now that the Crash
of '29 was an intricately engineered fiscal Armageddon as a necessary
prelude to the real Armageddon known as WWII. Historically speaking, a man
without a job, or prospects for employment in his homeland, is much more
likely to hire himself out to his gumment as a mercenary fighting in a
foreign land. Hasn't this been their (TPTW)* formula for both war and wealth
creation for eons.
* The Powers That Were
Although it has always worked like a charm (see
"War is a Racket" by Major General
Smedley Butler), we think the charm has
finally worn out. We also think this misbegotten
plan to foist WWIII upon us
has somehow been thwarted.
Yes, they've finally been snoockered! And they
don't even know it yet.
Someone, please send them this email.
