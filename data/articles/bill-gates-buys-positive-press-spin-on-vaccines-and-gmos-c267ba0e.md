Aaron Dykes of Prison Planet recently gave an
insightful TV news presentation analyzing The Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation's influence over the media to promote their "world health and
agriculture" agendas while soft pedaling the downside of all they're doing.
Such items as,
"Gates using his money to save lives... etc",
...have been
appearing in several news outlets, including ABC news (2).
Meanwhile, items that question Gates'
"philanthropic" endeavors are muffled or marginalized. Those endeavors deal
with,
These are
depopulation
favorites.
The Gates Foundation donated $1.5 million to ABC's News Project "Be the
change - Save a Life," extolling the virtues of ensuring Africans don't
starve. The NY Times mentioned Gates as the principal private funding source
and adviser for world food policy and agricultural development.
What's really behind
this media shell game
An audience tittered respectfully as
Bill Gates once announced how
vaccination programs could help reduce the world population by 15%. Those with megabucks tend to be idolized in this
culture.
They have an edge with getting away with such
statements and also lying publicly: (1-3)

While defending childhood vaccinations in a TV interview, Gates lied so
obviously about Dr.
Andrew Wakefield that he had trouble speaking for
a couple of moments:

Gates also promotes how GMOs will prove themselves in time, even as
thousands of Indian farmers commit suicide because they're trapped by
Monsanto terminator seeds' low cotton yields and terrible financial terms.
In addition, small farmers in other third world countries as well as in
North America suffer negative consequences from Monsanto's technology and
mafia like policies. It's no secret that Bill Gates has 500,000 shares of
Monsanto stock, valued at $27 million.
This is an investment, not a grant, that gives him some say with Monsanto.
A
French/German public TV alliance did a great documentary in English a few
years ago called "The
World According to Monsanto." How come so few world leaders and
mainstream journalists ignore this gem?
Bill is shrewd enough to offer 78 grants at smaller amounts, $100,000 each,
to cover as many depopulation tactics as possible. They include research for
vaccine delivery mosquitoes to ultrasonic mechanisms for
reducing human sperm counts.
Partners in crime
The Gates Foundation is in step with the Rockefeller foundation.
At the turn of the 20th century, the original
Rockefeller, John D. and family, managed to create the allopathic
medical
system and Big Pharma dominance that have become today's Medical Mafia for
profit and power. They were also and still are depopulation eugenicists.
Both foundations are financially linked with,
America's Green Revolution was initially funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation in the 1940s.
It led to Big Ag's mass monoculture farming that
has depleted topsoil while demanding toxic pesticides and herbicides along
with synthetic fertilizers that, in turn, help provide fluoride poisons for
public water supplies.
All this farming and food distribution has fallen into fewer hands. Among
them is Cargill. Control the food and you control the people. Of course,
Cargill wants in on the action to exploit Africa with AGRA and Monsanto, the
new "green revolution" group.
Just in case these billionaires destroy the food chain for most of the
world, they'll have the Doomsday Seed Bank for their future farming needs.
Along the way, Gates promoted and funded vaccinations that will assist the
depopulation agenda through disease and infertility. (3)
Gates is now also partnered with Gardasil
manufacturer Merck for research into creating infertility vaccines.
