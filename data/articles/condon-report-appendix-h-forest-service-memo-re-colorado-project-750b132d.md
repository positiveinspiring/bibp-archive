> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/condonreport/full_report/appndx-h.htm

Dr. Edward Condon, Department of Physics, University of Colorado, Boulder has requested Region 2 of the Forest Service to cooperate with the University on its UFO (Unidentified Flying Objects) Study. Although the study terminates June 30, 1968, they are anxious to provide a procedure for getting reports from Forest Service observers.
From their standpoint, this is not for the purpose of getting More data, but to get better data. Forest Service people, because of experience, background, and training, should be able to provide more accurate reports -- if they observe a UFO. Such reports would become part of a scientific study, and involvements with reporters or news sources should be avoided. The University has also requested reports from FAA and the Weather Bureau.
Standard procedure for Ranger Districts and National Forests to use to report a UFO follows:
A. Report information should include:
B. Report procedure:
So far as we know, Forest Service people in Region 2 have not sighted a UFO, but the above establishes procedure, and a report should be made if a UFO is sighted.
