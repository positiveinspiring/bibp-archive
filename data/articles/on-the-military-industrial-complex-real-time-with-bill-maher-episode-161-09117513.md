When the military says, 'We don't want
this,' and Congress is trying to shove this down their throats, that's a
sad statement of the political system that we have right now.
Anthony Woods
When the government is keeping programs alive just for make-work, for
jobs, isn't that more socialism than what healthcare would ever be?
Bill Maher
In the original draft of [President Eisenhower's] speech, it was "military-industrial-congressional
complex." And the "congressional" part was taken out because
the president felt that he'd had excellent relations with a Democratic
Congress and didn't want to get into name-calling on his way out.
Susan Eisenhower
Until we start to see some of that corruption actually prosecuted and
some of those people start going to jail - the military-industrial
complex is going to keep jamming weapon systems at the Pentagon,
force-feeding them, that the country doesn't need and that the country
doesn't want.
John Heilemann
