2013-2014
The 2014 FIFA World Cup
has brought to light the social inequalities,
injustices and class struggle in Brazil.
In response to property
speculation, gentrification, criminalization of the left
and forceful
removals, the "football crazy" country
has seen the largest protests in the
history of the championship.
Below is a selection of articles covering the
negative impacts
of this years World Cup on the largest country in Latin
America.
Brazil on Strike - Class Struggle and the World Cup

World Cup for whom?
The answer is a World Cup for big capital, large
construction companies, property owners, and the elites who can access the
games and get perks that middle-class attendees cannot afford. It is
primarily a World Cup for FIFA, a private institution whose World Cup
dealings have been slowly exposed.
Mega events are normally promoted as a big tourism opportunity for the host
country, and they are said to leave a legacy of improved infrastructure and
national image.
In the Brazilian case (and no doubt, to some extent,
everywhere else where such events are held), the legacy is broken promises
of improvement, capital and property speculation, dispossession, and the
promotion of a constructed image of Brazilian culture that highlights the
exotic and the stereotypical while it actively erases the social processes
that make up the daily lives of Brazilians.

Brazil - Workers
Struggle Trumps Sports Spectacle
Prof. James Petras

from

For decades social critics have bemoaned the influence of sports and
entertainment spectacles in 'distracting' workers from struggling for their
class interests.
According to these analysts, 'class consciousness' was
replaced by 'mass' consciousness. They argued that atomized individuals,
manipulated by the mass media, were converted into passive consumers who
identified with millionaire sports heroes, soap opera protagonists and film
celebrities.
The culmination of this 'mystification' - mass distraction
-were the 'world championships' watched by billions around the world and
sponsored and financed by billionaire corporations:
-
the World Series
(baseball)
-
the World Cup (soccer/football)
-
the Super Bowl (American football)
Today, Brazil is the living refutation of this line of cultural-political
analysis.
The biggest protests in the history of the World Cup have taken
place in Brazil. The myth of the mass media spectacles mesmerizing the
masses has been refuted - at least in present-day Brazil.
To understand why
the mass spectacle has been a propaganda bust it is essential to understand
the political and economic context in which it was launched, as well as the
costs and benefits and the tactical planning of popular movements.

Brazil's Olympics and
World Cup - Mega-Events and the Threat to Public Welfare

Olympic Capitalism - Bread and Circuses Without the Bread
Brazil is the host of the World Cup this year and the Olympics in 2016.
In
preparation Brazil is evicting 200,000 people from their homes, eliminating
poor neighborhoods, defunding public services, investing in a militarized
police and surveillance state, using slave and prison labor to build
outrageous stadiums unlikely to be filled more than once, and "improving" a
famous old stadium (the world's largest for 50 years) by removing over half
the capacity in favor of luxury seats.
Meanwhile, popular protests and
graffiti carry the message:
"We want 'FIFA standard' hospitals and schools!"
Brazil is just the latest in a string of nations that have chosen the glory
of hosting mega sports events like the Olympics and World Cup despite the
drawbacks.
And the author of Brazil's Dance With the Devil,
Dave Zirin,
makes a case that nations' governments don't see the drawbacks as drawbacks
at all, that in fact they are the actual motivation.
"Countries don't want
these mega-events in spite of the threats to public welfare, addled
construction projects, and repression they bring, but because of them."
Just
as a storm or a war can be used as an excuse to strip away rights and
concentrate wealth, so can the storm of sporting events that, coincidentally
or not, have their origins in the preparation of nations for war-making.

Brazil's Evolving Police State
- Political Coercion and Repression
Sabrina Fernandes

If 2013 put popular protests back into the historical map of Brazil, 2014 is
certainly prone to be even more essential for asserting the lasting power of
contestation by the radical Left.
In anticipation of the games and
elections, social dissidence, particularly in urban spaces, has turned into
a matter of national security.
With the growth and diversification of the groups involved in protests and
occupations since 2013, we can see an attempt toward the general
criminalization of demonstrations of dissidence and discontent that expands
the usual tactics already used against social movements.
The combination of
media attacks, police brutality, and the rearrangement of the legal system
to deal with criminal activity related to protests and social movements
(organized or autonomous) suggests an incremental coordinated effort between
the government and mainstream corporate media in Brazil to extend the
criminalization of social movements to all groups and individuals who
visibly demonstrate their opposition to the status quo.

Race, Class and the World Cup in Brazil

The Brazilian government and big business wanted the World Cup very badly.
But the people wanted better public services - especially the majority that
identify as non-white.
"Government studies have shown that people who
identify as black or brown make incomes that are less than half those of
their white counterparts and they are much more likely to lack access to
basic services like security, education, healthcare and sanitation."
At a total cost of roughly $11 billion - and at least eight workers' lives -
Brazil is hosting the most expensive World Cup in history.
Brazilians
overwhelmingly supported bringing the event to their country when FIFA
awarded them the honor in 2007, but a recent poll from DataFolha indicates
that a majority of citizens now oppose it.

The World Cup Soccer in Qatar (2022)
Controversy over Appalling Migrant Worker Conditions

The International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) chose Qatar to
host the 2022 World Cup games.
FIFA president
Sepp Blatter did so
disgracefully. He ignored outrageous exploitation foreign construction
workers face.
Qatar is a key US regional ally.
Doha hosts America's forward
CENTCOM (US
Central Command) headquarters. It's based at Al Udeid Air Base.
It's home
for 5,000 US forces. It's a hub for US Afghanistan and Iraq operations.
Qatar was instrumental in Obama's Libya war. Its special forces armed and
trained extremist Islamist militants. They included the CIA affiliated
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG). They're ideologically allied with Al
Qaeda.
In December 2004, the State Department designated it a Foreign Terrorist
Organization (FTO).
It doesn't matter. America uses Al Qaeda and likeminded
organizations as enemies and allies. Qatar supports Obama's war on Syria. It
helps recruit extremist fighters.
It provides funding, weapons and training.
It's part of Washington's plan to oust Assad.
