Just before the start of his first term on
January 20, 1993, President-Elect Clinton made a strange request to
close family friend and lawyer Webster Hubbell:
"If I put you over there in justice I want
you to find the answer to two questions for me: One, who killed JFK. And
two, are there UFOs." According to Hubbell, "Clinton was dead serious."
The key to unlocking the mystery of President
Kennedys assassination and a possible UFO connection lie in events that
occurred 18 years earlier in post-war Germany.
In the summer of 1945, John F. Kennedy was a guest of Navy Secretary
James Forrestal in a post-war tour of
Germany. Kennedy personally witnessed technological secrets that have still
not been disclosed to the general public.
These secrets stemmed from
technologies that Nazi Germany had acquired from around the
world, and were attempting to develop for their weapons programs. The
advanced technologies stunned the military government running the U.S. zone
of occupied Germany.
How did the Nazis develop them?
The answer according to the father of German
rocket design,
Herman Oberth, shocked U.S. military
officials. The Nazis had help from "the people of others worlds" - some of
the technologies were
extraterrestrial in origin.
In searching for answers to who killed President Kennedy we need to start
with the death of his mentor, James Forrestal in 1949. Forrestal became the
first Secretary of Defense in 1947, a position he held until March, 1949.
Forrestal was a visionary who thought Americans
had a right to know about the existence of extraterrestrial life and
technologies. Forrestal was sacked by President Truman because he was
revealing the truth to various officials, including Kennedy who was a
Congressman at the time. Forrestals ideals and vision inspired Kennedy, and
laid the seed for what would happen 12 years later.
After winning the 1960 Presidential election, Kennedy learned a
shocking truth from President
Eisenhower.
The control group set up to run highly
classified extraterrestrial technologies,
Majestic-12, had become a rogue government agency. Eisenhower
warned Kennedy that Majestic-12 had to be reined in. It posed a direct
threat to American liberties and democratic processes.
Kennedy followed Eisenhowers advice, and set
out to realize James Forrestals vision.
The same forces that orchestrated Forrestals
death, opposed Kennedys efforts at every turn. When Kennedy was on the
verge of succeeding, by forcing the CIA to share classified UFO information
with other government agencies on November 12, 1963, he was assassinated ten
days later.
Kennedys Last Stand is a book about how two American Presidents,
Eisenhower and Kennedy, confronted "black world" operations outside of the
control of "white world" constitutional government representatives.
Kennedys Last Stand reveals how JFK tried to
realize his friends and mentors vision of a world where humanity openly
knows
about extraterrestrial life. The book
reveals for the first time, the principal government officials responsible
for denying that vision, and orchestrating the assassination of President
Kennedy.
Kennedys Last Stand: Eisenhower, UFOs, MJ-12 and JFKs Assassination
by Michael E. Salla, becomes available at Amazon on October 22, 2013 - one
month before the 50th anniversary of the JFK
Assassination.
