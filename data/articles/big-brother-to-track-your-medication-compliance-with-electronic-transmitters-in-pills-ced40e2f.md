Now that the U.S. government has achieved its monopoly over health care, new
technologies are in the works that will allow the government to remotely
monitor and track whether ordinary citizens are complying with taking
medications prescribed by conventional doctors.
One new technology described at the U.S. Senate
Committee on Aging allows "pills to be electronically outfitted with
transmitters" which would track the patient's compliance with medications
and broadcast that information back to government health care enforcers who
check for "compliance and efficacy."
"Emerging technologies allow pills to be
electronically outfitted with transmitters to communicate with the
user's wristwatch that shows that the pill has been consumed," said
University of Virginia professor Robin Felder at the committee meeting.
"Broadband connectivity of these devices would allow the electronic
medical record to be updated with regard to medication compliance and
efficacy."
This would allow government health operators,
for example, to know whether you've taken all your prescribed psychiatric
medications.
If you veer from the course of pharmaceuticals prescribed by
your doctor, health care enforcement agents could be dispatched to your door
to make sure you start taking your pills.
Parents who currently attempt to protect their children from toxic medical
therapies such as chemotherapy could be closely monitored by government
medical enforcement agents.
If you try to flush dangerous pharmaceuticals
down the toilet instead of actually taking them, the lack of an electronic
tracking signal will let your health care observers know you didn't really
take the pills.
Get ready for E-Care
It's all part of a new push called
E-Care which involves a number of medical
devices that monitor you in your home and report back to government
authorities.
A blood pressure monitoring device, for example,
could report your blood pressure to your government-approved doctor. A blood
sugar monitoring device could determine if you've eaten too much sugar and
order you to take more diabetes pills to try to compensate.
Big Government, you see, doesn't just want to monopolize health care; it
wants to monitor your compliance with it. If you depart from their system of
pharmaceuticals, you may be found unfit as a parent, for example.
Or
possibly just declared insane (which gets you drugged with psych meds).
Big Brother snooping
in on your diet
One of the ultimate goals of this remote monitoring technology is to install
a blood monitoring chip in your arm that would sample and run diagnostic
tests on your blood every few minutes. While this could be used in a
positive way to detect early signs of cancer or liver problems, for example,
it could also be used to snoop on the dietary habits of everyday citizens.
If you take too much vitamin C, for example - beyond what is allowed by
CODEX - it could trigger a monitored alert that causes government-run
medical operatives to force their way into your home and confiscate your
"non-compliant" vitamins.
If your vitamin D levels rise high enough to actually prevent cancer, they
could have you arrested for "spending too much time in the sun" and thrown
into a hospital with no windows to, as they claim, "Protect you from skin
cancer."
These are some of the very practical realities that could theoretically
emerge in the dystopian medicalized society that seems to be getting closer
with each passing day.
We're monitoring you
for your own good
This isn't science fiction: It's modern medical fact.
As CNSNews reports,
"...Areas of interest include medicines that can tell a doctor if they have
been taken on time [and] wireless monitoring of nutritional information..."
Of course, as with all privacy-invading monitoring devices, government will
argue that monitoring you is "for your own good."
You can expect an
RFID
chip to be implanted in your arm, too, containing your entire medical
history. So every time you pass near an RFID reader at a
government-controlled facility (airports, schools, interstate toll booths,
etc.), your entire medical history can be scanned and assessed for a variety
of metrics.
Combined with the blood analysis chip implants, this would give health
enforcement authorities a way to find and arrest "dangerous" people - such
as people who aren't taking enough antidepressants, for example. Or people
who show signs of consuming herbal medicines.
All these people could be
tracked down, arrested and then forced to consume medications before they
are released back into the public.
TIA for your body
The program is basically
Total Information Awareness at the personal biology
level. Big Brother wants to monitor your biochemistry, you see, to make sure
you remain compliant with its pharmaceutical and junk foods agenda.
It's not enough for the government to monitor your phone calls, scan your
emails and watch you sunbathing on your back porch with spy satellites; now
they want to snoop into your bloodstream and monitor what you've been
eating, drinking or swallowing.
"This device here connects to other devices that measure a patient's blood
pressure and glucose [sugar] levels." said U.S. Senator Ron Wyden.
"It
wirelessly uploads this data to an electronic medical health record that is
monitored by a health care professional." (A government-mandated health care
enforcer, in other words.)
With this technology, they could even monitor your moods by tracking
fluctuations of hormone levels.
They will know when you're happy, when
you're angry, when you're having sex, when you're sleeping. All this
information will be at the fingertips of government health care enforcers
who are, of course, working to further the
Big Pharma agenda of medicating
everyone from cradle to grave.
Remote administration of medications
But it gets even worse.
Part of this E-Care technology involves the
remote
administration of medications directly into your bloodstream. A supply of
medication chemicals can be worn on your body (like a wristband, for
example), and when it receives a remote command from your health care
enforcers, it can inject another dose of some chemical into your
bloodstream.
These chemicals could be anything - antidepressants, tranquilizers, antipsychotics, statin drugs, chemotherapy drugs and so on. So now you've
got remote government medical operatives who can essentially control your
biochemistry as if you were a robot in a Big Government reality game.
If they are about to come to your house and take away your children because
you refused to give them vaccines, for example, they could first remotely
inject you with tranquilizers so that you will be "calm, docile and
compliant" upon their arrival.
This now puts the government in control of your mind through the remote
administration of mind-altering chemicals.
"What we're talking about, folks, is using a device like this one," said
Senator Wyden during the committee meeting. "It attaches to the patient's
skin and is loaded with drugs that are administered in the exact way that
the doctor prescribes - wirelessly."
Except it's not really the way the doctor prescribes; it's the way the
government prescribes.
Because now Big Government is running health care and
telling doctors exactly what to do. So government is determining what
chemicals get administered to you, and before long they'll be able to
administer those chemicals wirelessly.
Did you get your happy
chemicals today?
At the click of a mouse, in other words, Big Government could mass medicate
the entire nation.
Imagine the entire population being dosed with "happy
chemicals" in the days before an important vote. Or imagine the population
being medicated with "anger hormones" following some staged false-flag
attack, all designed to create outrage so that the politicians can sweep in
with yet more "solutions" that destroy civil liberties.
This may be what's coming, which is why establishing a government health
care monopoly was so important in the first place.
Without the government
monopoly and the IRS penalties for non-compliance, there would be no way to
force everybody into participating in such a system. But now, health care
run by Big Government has opened the door for us all to be chipped,
monitored and medicated without our knowledge and against our will.
It's a
brave new world after all, it seems.
Maybe the drug-dispensing
implants will start administering soma to us all (suggested reading:
Brave New World)
