The increasingly desperate gangsters known as
the Bilderberg group, in a last minute
effort to maintain their rule, last week ordered assassination teams to kill
prominent truth seekers, including this reporter, according to CIA sources.
In a related move Italian authorities have been
trying to sell the $134.5 billion worth of bonds they seized even as they
continue to prosecute an Italian gentleman with fraud for possessing these
bonds. At stake is the survival of
the
Vatican Bank and perhaps even
the BIS.
According to a prominent member of the CIA assassination squad the Pope and
Prime Minister Berlusconi of Italy sent a nine-man assassination team
to Japan headed by a highly professional 40-something assassin who goes by
the name of Guissepe to kill this writer.
The Yakuza, Mossad and the CIA all refused to go
along with the assassination and it has now been called off, Yakuza and CIA
sources say.
These banksters seem to have had the mistaken
impression that killing this writer and other whistleblowers would somehow
stop the implementation of the new metals-backed banking system.
The Vatican banker directly involved is now wanted by Interpol and is on the
run. He has been trying to sell, on behalf of the Italian government, the
$134.5 trillion worth of bonds seized in June of 2009 at 10% of their face
value. Meanwhile this same Italian government is trying to prosecute
Alessandro Santi for fraud because he asked Italian authorities to
release the two Japanese nationals who were arrested with the bonds by
testifying they were genuine.
The Vatican Bank also approached the White Dragon Society (or
Black Dragon Society?)
with a promise of $60 billion a month (for saving the planet) so long as the
new financial system remained under Vatican control.
The White Dragon Society explained that
the new financial system would have to be under the control of the people of
the planet and not some secretive unelected group.
As the fiat (out of nothing) currencies known as the
Federal Reserve promissory note and the Euro continue to implode,
the families that have for so long ruled the world with paper money will be
trying to carry out new atrocities.
Since they are sun-worshippers, people
need to be especially wary around the time of the June 21st
summer solstice when sacrifices involving fire are required by their belief
system. The explosion of missing South African nuclear weapons band
the possible torching of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill are two scenarios to
be wary of but this is only conjecture.
Who knows what they might try next.
Once again for the millionth time (OK, I exaggerate but it seems like that)
the Federal Reserve Board cabal have been trying to goad Israel and Iran
to annihilate each other as an offering to Satan but fortunately, sane
minds continue to prevail. The Pentagon is doing everything in its power to
prevent this and other World War 3 scenarios.
The Euro will continue to be attacked via Spain, Italy, Hungary, the Baltic
countries, Ireland until the Euro and the EU both collapse. The US
government is for its part, continuing to prepare to decouple the US dollar
from the international dollar.
Meanwhile, the Chinese have finished inspecting the gold to be used to back
the new international currency and have invited members of the White
Dragon Society as well as prominent financiers to Peking for
consultations about the new financial system.
In a related move, the Middle Eastern Royal families are exploring
the possibility of an alliance with
European families that should eventually
result in an end to the artificial attempts to get the Islamic and Christian
worlds to fight each other.
The Jews in Israel will be offered complete security and autonomy in
exchange for a permanent, fair, peace agreement. The Middle Eastern oil
countries have also agreed on the need to phase out oil as an energy source
and embrace the free energy technologies.
Preparations are being made for the release of hitherto forbidden technology
including
free energy,
anti-gravity, life-extension therapy and
more.
We have also heard from two Japanese owners of
new Toyota Prius hybrid cars that they have not had to refill their gas
tanks once since buying their cars. This is still unconfirmed by Toyota PR
but could well be the explanation for the recent attempts to harass
Toyota.
In Japan, meanwhile,
Naoto Kan has become the new prime
minister but already Japanese secret government sources are starting to say
his rule will be short.
The latest scenario is to have Kan preside over
the July 11th upper house elections and, if his Democratic Party
of Japan gets a majority in both houses, he will then raise taxes. After
this he will resign and be replaced by Panasonic (Matsushita) sponsored
Kazuhiro Haraguchi.
Kan, however, has his own plans to extend his rule and increase his
popularity by taking on the Japanese
medical/pharmaceutical mafia.
A DPJ member of Parliament involved in
overseeing the Health and Welfare Ministry promises a revolution
against evil Western medical practices.
...will all be targets, the MP said.
The Japanese right wing defense/yakuza/police establishment, for their part,
have lots of dirt on Kan and will no doubt try to generate scandals ASAP.
They are hoping to unite various splintered right-wing groups into a new
right-wing party that can give the DPJ a run for their money.
The people behind the Bank of Japan (BOJ)
for their part will do everything in their power to prevent the DPJ from
restructuring Japanese government debt that is now running at 215% of GDP.
This problem could be dealt with within a week
by means of redenominating the Yen but that would mean the owners of the BOJ
would be denied centuries of payments from the artificially indebted
Japanese people.
As usual, there is a lot we are being asked not to report in order to
prevent sabotage by the Feds.
