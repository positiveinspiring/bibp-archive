Alien Technology At Pine Gap
SECRET TECHNOLOGY AT PINE GAP
In the book
Cosmic Conspiracy by Stan Deyo, he writes that
Pine Gap is 12
miles from the dead centre of Australia and has been drilled down 5.3 miles.
This bore could be used as an underground antenna for VLF electricity
broadcasts. He says as it is supposed to be involved in both upper
atmospheric sub-surface research, the 'bore antenna' could be used to tune
a gigantic 'standing wave' field around the entire planet.
This system could be tuned to set up a resonating electric field around the planet to an altitude of 250 miles. The book says that there are rumors saying that Pine Gap has a very large nuclear facility used to power its enormous 'transceiver'. More rumors say also high-voltage high-energy plasma accelerators possibly for power generation, a 'death ray' or plasma cannon.
Dr. Jean Francois Gille writes that the US base at West Cape, near Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia has an older type of the transceiver used at Pine Gap which is used to send electric current to submerged US submarines who trail a wire antenna. It is known that electric currents transmitted in this way are referred to as plasmo-dynamic cells.
Stan Deyo continues that a 1973
press release said that Pine Gap and its sister station in Guam (Micronesia
in the Pacific) supported photographic satellites. Each weighed 11 tons, was
50 feet long by 10 feet wide which could scan the entire surface of the
earth every 24 hours, varying its altitude from 100-200 miles for
'close-ups'. The pictures were so sharp they could show an object 12 inches
wide. They could also use infra-red sensors.
ANTI GRAV RESEARCH AT PINE GAP
Bill Chalker wrote for the Australasian UFOLogist that "William Martin" a
major NSA defector revealed that US has been carrying out continuous
research into electromagnetic propulsion at Pine Gap since 1966. This was
originally started in US after the war. It was necessary to move this to
more remote spots.
Security aspects have included hypnotic and post hypnotic keys planted in personnel prior into acceptance into the project. Apparently 2 Pine Gap employees visiting Perth spoke of electromagnetic devices manifesting as UFOs and even alien beings at Pine Gap. Also 3 witnesses saw a camouflaged door open up within Pine Gap and a circular metallic craft rose vertically and silently, before taking off at high speed.
This collaborates what we were told in the Fortress Australia article. Billy Dee was sent a post about a man who claimed his father worked on UFOs at Pine Gap. He worked for the FAA most of his life and also worked at the Traffic Control Centre in Seymour CA in 1970 fixing the programming of mainframe computers. he was one of only 2 or 3 in the US who knew whatever program they were installing.
During the late 70's he made several trips to Washington DC, Atlantic City and Australia. He wasn't allowed to talk to his wife about what he did, saying it was beyond his control. She would get mad at his long trips to Australia. When the parents came to visit on one of their usual 'sudden' arrivals and departures, the man noticed a locked briefcase that was chained to him. They were followed by 2 men everywhere in a car. They too, became under constant surveillance and their phone was tapped. The son noticed vans with govt.. license plates following him everywhere too and started getting threatening phone calls.
After
confronting his father he confessed that he was working on a flying saucer,
involved with anti-gravity propulsion, melding the computer elements
together for the guidance or stability part of it, underground at Pine Gap.
He said that he could get ANY information on his son to prove what he said
was true. The next day he called and revealed all his personal business and
told him to be quiet and not make waves or they would not be around.
THE UNDERGROUND BASES
Branton writes that the Rand symposium held on Deep Underground Construction
indicated during the 50's plans were made to build underground bases,
laboratories and city-complexes linked by a stupendous
network of tunnels to preserve and protect the ongoing secret interests of
the secret societies.
These secret societies made a pact with alien entities in order to further motives of domination.
But THEY are now being dominated
by the aliens who think the humans inferior.
THE UNDERGROUND NETWORK AND AGHARTI
The Dulce Book by
Branton describes the Mt. Shasta California underground
city, Telos, a branch of a subterranean kingdom of Agharti under Mongolia.
Apparently 2 opposing factions from there supported different sides of the
WW2. The technologists sided with the Allied Forces and the Occultists with
the Axis Forces.
An occult order called Melchizedek is based in Telos and in Sirius. Sirian cultists believe one world government is for world peace and to raise this planet into 4th dimensional frequency.
People in ancient
Bavarian-Roman cults (secret societies) promoting the formation of global
government, are being manipulated by reptilians to annex this planet to
their Luciferian interstellar empire-collective.
VISIT TO DULCE, NEW MEXICO -Branton
STRANGENESS ON THE ARCHULETA PLATEAU
The transcript, titled:
'RECOLLECTIONS AND IMPRESSIONS OF VISIT TO DULCE, NEW MEXICO - OCTOBER 23,
24, 1988', is reproduced in its entirety below.
"Upon arrival I was introduced to Dr. John F. Gille, a French National. Dr. Gille has a Ph.D. in Math/Physics from the University of Paris. He had worked very closely with the French Government on the UFO phenomena in that country. Dr.. Gille had also released a report on another 'Dulce-like' base near Pine Gap - Alice Springs, Australia. This base is a massive multi-leveled facility run by the "Club of Rome" which, like the 'Bilderberger' organization, is reputedly a cover for the Bavarian Illuminati.
The article spoke of antigravity disk research, and plans to make Pine Gap a major "control center" for a "New World Order". Pine Gap is equipped with whole levels of computer terminals tied-in to the major computer mainframes of the world which contain the intimate details of most of the inhabitants of industrialized nations.
The article also spoke of the infiltration of several major religious denominations, the media, international governments, the economy, education, and other levels of society by the Bavarian Illuminati, in order to prepare the way for a New World Order dictatorship. The report also stated that the workers at Pine Gap are highly indoctrinated and programmed so that they do not threaten or sabotage the security of the Illuminati projects being carried out there", wrote Branton.
UNDERGROUND RITUALS
Excerpts from
Manipulating Those of Us
on the "Surface"
by Branton
Branton states that:
" the underground rh-negative reptilian hybrid genetic lines have been manipulating us on the "surface" for centuries. The underground society acting as the "parasite". Members of the Masonic lodge, have access with those living below having been initiated into the 13 Illuminati degrees i.e. the 34-46 degrees. The House of the Temple in Washington D.C. says Rev. Jim Shaw showed definite signs of SERPENT WORSHIP during his own initiation into the 33rd Freemason degree.
Underneath most major cities, especially in the USA, there exist subterranean counterpart "cities" controlled by the Masonic/Hybrid/Alien "elite". Often surface/subsurface terminals exist beneath Masonic Lodges, Police Stations, Air Ports and Federal Buildings of many cities. Those in the underground society have access to interstellar technology and in fact our controlled society actually serves to FEED their ongoing conquests of other worlds [including the use of Montauk-like Stargate/time-tunnel technology which our planetary grid, which is unique in the universe, allows].
Some of the major population centers were deliberately established by the Masonic/hybrid elite of the Old and New "worlds" to afford easy access to already existence under ground levels, some of which are thousands of years old, and considering that Los Alamos Labs had working prototype nuclear powered thermol-bore drills that could literally melt tunnels through the earth at a rate of 8 mph 40 YEARS AGO, you can imagine how extensive these underground systems have become."
THE CULT OF THE SERPENT
New York City is one of the largest draconian nests in the world i.e. the
ancient underground 'Atlantean' systems that network beneath that area. They
literally control the entire Wall Street pyramid from below with more than a
little help from reptilian blood lines like
the Rockefellers, etc.
maintaining control of planet earth is ESSENTIAL to the reptilian cause of
conquest and control of the entire galaxy if not beyond, due to the
uncommonly diverse and rare elements and resources that this planet
contains, not to mention the grid-system which allows for the generation of
time/space gates.
For instance, one couple who was initiated into the "cult of the serpent" was later approached by an agent of a major space "Federation", who informed them of the many atrocities that the "Alt-3" forces of earth were committing against the peaceful inhabitants of other worlds.
Branton thinks they are referring to the black operations based beneath Neu Schwabeland Antarctica, Dulce New Mexico, Pine Gap Australia, and Montauk NY.

THE PINE GAP UNDERGROUND BASE - AUSTRALIA'S UFO CONNECTIONS
An article was sent to the Rumor Mills news site anonymously about recent
developments in Australia preparing it to be a safe haven for the global
elite during a one world Government with martial law.
An alien invasion may
also be impending. It
appears to be written by an Australian former govt. insider.
Here is a short summary:
In 1989 Australian emergency services began to be upgraded and military reservists encouraged and the National Safety Council was started for this (NSCA). Police, Fire and Ambulance services are now under one roof and sold to a company called 'Intergraph Inc' which is a specialized American communications company said to be closely connected to the NSA.
In 1976 an American John Fredrich, backed by the CIA joined and became executive director in 1982. It expanded rapidly with an elaborate base in Gippsland, Victoria containing a private airforce and marine section.
Australian intelligence were trained by the CIA. NSCA provided security back up to all the American secret bases in Australia including the new Omega bases in Victoria and Tasmania. The U.S. Airforce conducted joint training exercises with the NSCA. The association with the East Sale secure RAAF base was a close one and is often used by NASA U2 flights and other unexplained U.S. aircraft. It is also the repository of secret UFO information and Frederick Valentich attended for a special course relating to UFOs before he disappeared over Bass Strait in 1978 while reporting a close encounter with a large UFO.
So concerned was Valentich about what he had seen and been told at Sale that he emotionally told his parents shortly afterwards that "should they take me I should be O.K. so don't worry, they will probably put me back." NSCA is said to be closely involved with the UFO problem and can effect retrievals on land and from the great ocean depths.
Their private airline for did drug running and moving laundered money in and out of Australia. Freidrich flew in an executive jet in U.S. colors and the CIA insignia on the tail and his ex personal pilot mentioned three occasions he collected him from Pine Gap where was always waiting alone on the vacant airstrip.
AUSTRALIA IS NOW UNDER AMERICA'S POWER
A new headquarters is being selected near Canberra probably in underground
facilities in the Snowy Mountains. It is a vast system capable of
supporting thousands of people and connected to Canberra by a secret
underground railway. There is now an integrated military force is
coordinated with all emergency services and police organizations.
The machinery of a police state is firmly in place and total military control could be established in a few hours. In 1996 the Australian army, airforce and navy were coordinated under a single Commanding Officer. New training methods for the police have been adopted and 'state of the art' equipment purchased. The F.B.I has been helping restructure in line with the American system. This includes specialized training courses in 'Advanced Interrogation Methods.'
Australian prison's are being privatized by Wackenhut Inc., owned by a former FBI senior officer and still in contact with them and the CIA. Rumors persist of internment camps in prohibited military areas. Wackenhut Inc is supplying hundreds of kit form tent prisons, razor wire and electric fencing. In 1975 Prime Minister Whitlam resented America's secret bases at Pine gap, Narrunga and NW Cape.
Ironically Pine Gap helped Whitlam's removal by carrying secret communications between Washington and Australia. The spy Christopher Boyce read the top secret coded traffic going to and coming from Pine Gap which indicated that America was destroying the Australian Govt.. His supervisor, named the Governor General, who sacked Whitlam as 'our man Kerr'. Boyce saw daily instructions sent to C.I.A. field officers, Australian union leaders, politicians, senior public officials and many others on the payroll. Pine Gap made it easy.
The deputy P.M. Dr.
Jim
Cairns, claimed the Americans would mount a violent overthrow of the
government if they did not succeed by clandestine means. Saying 'I believe
there is a strong chance the Americans will try to do to us what they have
just done in Chile, we could all be killed in the process.' He was serious.
THE PINE GAP OPERATION
A scientist among Australia's elite in a key position revealed: There are at
least ten top secret American facilities in Australia with the so called
'Joint defense Space Research Facility' at
Pine Gap being the most
important. Originally Pine Gap was decreed to control and act as a downlink
for geosynchronous satellites gathering intelligence, stationed over the
Pacific and Asia by the CIA, NSA and the NRO.
Pine Gap's position is for its proximity to the Pacific and Indian Oceans and Asia, and window to outer space. Its position on the earth's surface in relation to other important areas situated on the planet, its isolation and situation in an area of low electromagnetic radiation. Construction was undertaken solely by American contractors who flew in their own workforce from the US on a shift basis. The base became operational after 2 years. Large underground facilities are rumored to extend some twelve levels below the base. Long tunnels are laid out in a pattern similar to the spokes of a wheel and extend several miles from the center of the base.
In a deep shielded underground chamber a secret nuclear reactor similar in size to those used to power submarines was installed to drive large AC and DC generators. It also has an 'official' above ground diesel powered generating station, shut down most of the time and not connected to an outside electricity supply. Reportedly, extending some 20,000 below the base is a bore hole containing an ultra low frequency antenna which is apparently used for secret experiments supposedly related to Nikola Tesla's resonance theories as well as low frequency communications throughout the world.
Pine Gap's communication systems are the most sophisticated available utilizing satellites, microwave, low frequency and their own dedicated cable to the U.S.A. They are directly connected to Nurrunga, North West Cape, Geraldton, Australian Defense Signals Directorate in Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, all CIA and NSA stations, ASIO, SIS and the Australian Defense Science and Technology Organization which deals with UFOs and crash retrievals. Weekly personal shopping is undertaken in the U.S.A.
Pine Gap is a multi-billion dollar operation of great importance to the American government. Pine Gap has eight white radomes placed near groups of long low buildings. A few miles from the base has a double security fence patrolled continuously by American guards and the Australian Federal Police Force. Pine Gap is now being expanded. A second above ground power station is now under construction as well as a large number of houses for additional staff. The staff was increased to around 1,200 in 1996.
The reason given is "Asian
economic espionage".
UFOs SEEN NEAR PINE GAP
The Fortress Australia writer says Central and South Australia has always
had high UFO activity focusing on the Woomers rocket-range and the nuclear
test site at Maralinga. Since construction started at Pine Gap and later at
Nurrunga, there was a rapid rise in UFO sightings, which have continued,
some being described as bizarre. One case in 1989 involved three hunters who
were on an all night shooting trip in the hills near Pine Gap.
At around 4.30a.m. they observed a large camouflaged door open on the side of a low hill inside the security compound and a metallic, circular disc appear from the gaping black hole, tip on its edge and disappear vertically at tremendous speed. The door then slowly shut and everything returned to normal.
The camouflage was so good that from their vantage point they were unable to observe anything unusual about the area after the door closed. In 1975 the occupants of a passenger plane which was passing, observed a large white object, similar in size to one of the white radomes, suddenly leapt into the air and disappeared rapidly towards the north west.
Most of the
passengers and crew witnessed the event. In 1980 a camouflaged door case
occurred when two members of the Northern Territory Police, who were taking
part in a search for a missing Alice Springs child, watched as three 'bath
tub' shaped objects flew slowly over the base and then one by one
disappeared in to an oblong black hole in a hillside. This also occurred
during the early hours of the morning and as the two police officers had
arranged to meet other members of the search party they left without seeing
the door close.
STRANGE BEAMS FROM UFOs AT PINE GAP
In 1973 another type of sighting involves, blue, red and gold pencil like
beams. A man camped near Pine Gap saw a vertical shaft of very bright blue
light emanating from the area of the base. His binoculars showed most of the
base, 8 miles away as well as a strange looking object apparently hovering
above it at a height he estimated to be around one thousand feet. Firstly he
thought it was a cigar shaped balloon or blimp but this idea quickly
evaporated when the object slowly tipped to a 45 deg angle exposing what
appeared to be its top surface.
The object was perfectly circular with a central dome. 1000 feet above the base the cartographer estimated the diameter of the disc to be a little more than half the distance between the Pine Gap base and the disc's bottom edge, making it between 500/600 ft in diameter. In the moonlight the disc appeared to be a dull gray color with a slight yellow fuzz around its edge. A thin bright blue beam, like a rod, slowly extended from the disc to the base.
It slowly moved in a telescopic fashion from the disc and gradually extended behind the radomes. A few minutes later the light beam retracted only to be followed by a similar blue beam slowly extending from the base to the disc. Followed by a gold colored beam which appeared very close to the blue one. After about thirty seconds both retracted back into the base.
This process continued for about forty
minutes and ended when the disc made some rapid oscillations 'lit up like a
neon sign' and ascended vertically at very high speed, disappearing in a few
seconds. After he reported it he got a 'grilling' by some very officious
people who warned him to keep silent about his experience otherwise he would
be in for some very real trouble.
A MORE COMPLEX SIGHTING AT PINE GAP.
In 1984 five witnesses on a tip-off, positioned themselves about ten miles
away. Vehicles were moving around the main base and groups of people in
coveralls were gathering near the radomes. Suddenly a bright beam of gold
colored light sprang up from the centre of the radome area. This was not a
pencil like beam but seemed to be several meters in width and extremely
intense. The width of the beam appeared to remain the same as far as it
could be seen extending vertically into the sky. It looked almost solid.
Long uneven clouds developed in the clear air surrounding the beam which despite a breeze blowing at the time remained stationary. The beam suddenly cut off and the tubular cloud started to drift to the east like a vertical vapor trail. The beam pulsed several times and each time it did so the cloud effect returned even forming what looked like a series of smoke rings. They all felt extremely disturbed even to the point of nausea.
The gold light beam shot down and once again the dirty looking clouds started drifting away. Then 5 star like objects approached from the South. 4 were in a tight diamond shaped formation and the fifth which looked like a cylinder followed at a distance of about two miles. The 4 smaller objects took up positions north, south, east and west of the base each moving in small circles.
The white cylindrical shaped object with a bright while halo around it's center moved towards the base reducing altitude to about 500 feet and stopped, rocking up and down for the whole duration. Once in position blue light beams started flashing between all 5 objects and the ground. After about 5 minutes one of the small objects rapidly descended towards the base and appeared to land at its northern end. It remained for 17 minutes then returned to its original position east of the base and approximately one thousand feet from the ground.
The gold light beam again emanated from the area of the radomes. This time the small objects began to rotate around the beam and ascend vertically as if they were examining it. The 4 objects then returned spiraling down the beam and returning to their previous positions. The cloud was thickening around the light beam and looked like a long thin Ionic column. The beam was turned off and once again the grayish cloud broke up and drifted towards the east.
In a jerking motion the cylindrical object
started to gain altitude stopping in proximity to the smaller objects which
had reformed their diamond shaped formation. The group then moved off in a
southerly direction and disappeared in a few seconds. The witnesses saw 7
other UFO's in the area over the next few days and it was recorded on video.
UFO SIGHTINGS AT ALICE SPRINGS
The Keith Basterfield Network Australasia has catalogued various sightings
near Alice Springs. In summary these have been witnessed: Campers saw a
bright silver ball of white light flickering, then other white lights grouped
with it and they moved away quickly; in 1998 witnesses saw a large silver
glow in the sky the size of a basketball which disappeared south. The 2 way
radio failed during this appearance.
At the same time there had been a triangular shaped cluster of 5 smaller lights flickering back and forth, which faded out. Other sources say in 1996 40 orange lights the size of a thumbnail comprised 2 distinct formations. The first was a circle of 19 lights which hovered for about 15 minutes. Then 21 similar lights moved into 2 straight lines from east to west, then formed one evenly spaced straight line. Both formations then traveled west and were lost sight of; a UFO showing like a blue light landed about 10 km west of Alice Springs.
Suddenly it rose up and the witnesses saw it was about 14 meters diameter, with a flat base with lines running around the bottom and a rounded top. The blue light formed a halo around it and it made a whirly noise. It was above the car for a short time and they thought they were being watched.
It then flew
towards Pine Gap. The locals said then that many cement trucks were going to
Pine Gap. A man has claimed that to have been taken aboard a UFO and flown
to a base beneath Pine Gap, where evidence of "alien liaison" between
aliens,
the military and government was occurring on a cosmic scale.
WORLD ALIEN CONTACTS
The Fortress Australia writer claims alien contact was possibly first
achieved by the USA, with information from various sources indicating radio
communication followed by personal contact occurred in the early 1950's. The
Soviet Union and UK established their own contacts about the same time.
After some understanding was reached
the initial methods of communication were centralized in the USA with the
Russians co-operating by the mid 1950's.
This developed the secret establishment of the NSA by the Truman administration in November, 1954 to identify, monitor and establish reliable and secure communications with visiting aliens with which they are now deeply involved. The aliens are pursuing their own agendas and reject interference from earth's officialdom or the broad masses they control. Alien involvement in Australia is similar to that of the U.S.A., Europe and Russia.
For some technological rewards and minor co-operation in other areas the E.T.'s conduct their own genetic experimentation and the exploitation of the country is generally totally unhindered by humans. They do what they want as there is no way of stopping them.
Alien involvement in Australian affairs started in the late 1940's just as it did in the USA.
During the 1950's and early 1960's the British were conducting nuclear testing in South Australia, test firing a variety of missiles at the Woomera Rocket Range. The UFO activity was so intense that it had to be suspended, often for several days, due to electromagnetic effects causing total electrical failure at the test sights. Woomera itself was often blacked out for hours by the close approach of the UFOs.
More than
sixteen thousand feet of film was taken of a variety of vehicles
crisscrossing the area. During the early 1950's both the USA and Russia
made contact with two alien species who apparently often worked together on
various scientific projects and joint military matters including what we
would describe as the policing of their own areas of
influence.
TECHNICAL HELP FROM ALIENS TO PREVENT AN ATTACK FROM OUTER SPACE
As many as seven other groups were visiting the planet not associated with
the first two. They were unfriendly to them and each other and often
directly hostile to humans. Secret official research at the time indicated
that several of these groups appeared to be preparing a huge world wide
military operation or police action against the earth.
So friendly co-operation with the first two groups became even more important. Technical help provided by the two initial contact groups brought accelerated technology and made the development of SDI a real possibility. In return for our governments allowing these aliens secret exploitation of the planet and human race, they would provide the technical know how to prevent further major wars and stop any other interested extraterrestrials from invading the planet.
It has been said with some authority that they are the brains behind SDI (Star Wars) the extension of which is HAARP which is aimed at creating an electromagnetic shield around the world to prevent an attack from outer space. The Russians have actively co-operated since its inception. Such advanced defense systems required world wide coverage involving operational centers in secure areas in several countries.
Australia is utilized for this purpose. Pine Gap involves secret scientific experiments into anti gravity and magnetic propulsion. Though its communication functions are important its research and developments sections situated below the surface are considered vital to the future of the planet. Here extraterrestrials conduct their work in partial co-operation with human scientists.
They live in
special conditions in virtual isolation and come and go as they please.
The final stages of SDI including the HAARP system should be functioning by
1998/99 and if necessary its entire world wide operation will be
controllable from the network of secret bases in Australia. We can only
guess who controls it.
OTHER AUSTRALIAN US BASES
Nurrungar base is similar, on the surface its military role is to draw
information from a series of geostationary satellites which watch for
missile launches and nuclear detonations throughout Asia and the Middle
East. Acting as a back up facility to Pine Gap with extensive underground
installations and also an illegal nuclear reactor. Nurrungar base began in
1969 and the UFO activity in the Woomera area increased during nuclear and
missile testing of the 1950's and early 1960's. It remains one of the most
active UFO areas in Australia.
One source told the anonymous writer that aliens used Nurrunga too with a free hand and there was no way of controlling them. "They run the place," he said. Nurrungar's purpose remains top secret, but it has similar communication links as Pine Gap and a separate undersea cable link to the USA. Rumours are that direct links are maintained with a similar installation situated in North West China and the ultra secret American base at the South Pole.
Woomera remains part of the global network and is said to be involved in a wide range of low frequency and resonance experimentation in conjunction with Pine Gap and the Alaskan based HAARP project. North West Cape could be a key point in controlling the HAARP magnetic field over a large part of the southern hemisphere.
In Geraldton installation, W.A the principal partners are the USA and Australia. Under the UKUSA agreement the British and other club members are given access to the information gathered when it is considered necessary. The controlling bodies of the ultra modern installation are the American NSA and the Australian DSD. It monitors the entire Australian telecommunication system, all incoming and outgoing international telephone calls, faxes, telex and radio transmissions.
It
operates in conjunction with Pine Gap and to a lesser extent Nurrungar
giving it almost unlimited intrusive powers into all levels of electronic
communications in Australia. Geraldton is one of the most expensive
installations ever built. A source quoted the actual figure at one billion
and four hundred million dollars with the The system is capable of
conducting worldwide clandestine surveillance and like UK, one of its major
purposes is to gather intelligence information from throughout the United
States.
THE EAST SALE UFO ACCIDENTALLY SEEN AT A HANGAR
The Fortress Australia writer also said the East Sale RAAF base in Victoria,
NASA makes extensive use of the facilities on a regular basis and many other
American and foreign nationality aircraft have been seen there along with
other strange aircraft operating mainly at night time, which appear like
American Stealth fighter planes. Since the late 1940's, in co-operation with
the United States and other major world government authorities East Sale has
become a major UFO research establishment including crash retrievals.
During the 1980's 4 people from a TV station attended the opening of a building at RAAF East Sale. One such hanger had two side doors were partly open so they decided to take a look inside. Towards the rear of the hanger was a large metallic gray disc like object standing on three short legs. It was about sixty feet in diameter with a central height of about eighteen to twenty feet. Scaffolding was arranged around it's right hand side with a platform extending to what looked like a curved top doorway situated near the top of the object.
They also noticed what appeared to be small square windows on each side of the doorway and evenly spaced around the top of the object. They videoed it noticing surface markings similar to Korean script. There was a elderly man talking to two smaller men, the size of 5 year old children in the center of the office area. They were looking at drawings on a small table and didn't notice the cameramen The tall man looked up and appeared puzzled by the two cameramen.
He walked to the door and asked them if HQ needed more pictures and why hadn't they called him about it. The TV men replied that they had nothing to do with HQ. The man's expression had absolute horror. The intruders met four guards who confiscated the film.
