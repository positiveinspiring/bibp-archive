There is no greater natural
resource on this earth than water.
As the sustenance of all
life, water keeps every living and breathing organism,
every plant, every animal and every human being on this
planet alive.
In the same way that without
air to breathe, without water we humans cannot sustain
life for more than a few days.
Due to 'global warming,' widespread drought and
increasingly polluted water systems, the projected availability of clean
freshwater in years to come to meet the rising demands of a growing global
population is among the most daunting human challenges of this century.
By 2015 a 17% increase in global water demand is
projected just for increasing agriculturally produced food.
By the same year 2025, the growing global
population will increase water consumption needs by a whopping 40%. While
oil played the keenly critical role during the twentieth century, water is
being deemed the most valued precious natural resource of the twenty-first
century.
As such, several years ago
the United Nations declared access to clean drinking water
a universal human right.
Conversely, willfully denying it is considered a
serious human rights violation that denies life itself. And any calculated
decision denying people their universal right to life is nothing short of a
murderous, shameful crime against humanity.
Despite the human air pollution that has long
been dirtying our lungs, while also causing global warming, climate change
and increasing catastrophic natural disasters, not to mention the growing
global health hazard for us humans, the very thought of making clean air a
precious commodity that can opportunistically be packaged and sold by the
same corporations that have been ruining our air, that very notion would
instantly be criticized, scorned and ridiculed.
Yet that is exactly what has been happening for
the last thirty years now all over this planet with the earth's preciously
dwindling freshwater drinking supply.
The World Bank has been financing global
privatization of the earth's water supply making clean water that is so
necessary for survival an unaffordable private commodity for the poorest
people on earth to even access.
They are literally dying of thirst and disease
because of greedy psychopathic corporate profiteers once again placing theft
and greed over human welfare and life itself.
But then that is
the globalist agenda -
thinning
the human herd down from near seven billion currently to as low as just half
a billion.
That means 13 out of 14 of us alive today according to their
diabolical oligarch plan simply must die within the next few years. And what
better way to rapidly kill off the human population than taking full
ownership and control over the earth's limited diminishing water supply.
More people on this planet are dying presently
from waterborne disease from dirty water than are dying from all wars and
violence worldwide combined.
Every hour 240
babies die from unsafe water. 1.5 million children under five
years of age die every year from cholera and typhoid fever due to unsanitary
water conditions.
These incredibly sad, alarming facts illustrate
just how significant and critical a clean freshwater supply is to staying
alive on this planet. Taking control over the earth's clean water supply is
achieved by turning water into a privately owned commodity that only the
largest corporations and banks control.
Simply making water unaffordable and thereby
inaccessible to the poorest people on the planet is one extremely effective,
albeit most sinister way to reduce the so called overpopulation problem.
Three primary ways that the human population
decreases significantly every year is death caused by,
-
starvation and
malnutrition (including lack of drinkable water) at between seven
to eight million people
-
diseases that kill between two
to three million (with mounting threats of infectious diseases
becoming pandemics)
-
upwards of near a half
million dying each year from war
Behind closed doors oligarchic globalists
periodically meet and discuss what is best for humanity and the planet
according to them and their megalomaniacal self-interests.
For many years now this all important topic of
water privatization and control as a convenient and most effective means of
addressing the overpopulation problem has been regularly tabled for
discussion
along with related topics like,
...and a host of other means for culling the
human population.
Time Magazine reported
how the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been financing research at the
University of North Carolina among 78 others to develop ultrasound
infertility contraception techniques to sterilize male sperm.
At a 2010 TED
conference Bill Gates spoke openly of
depopulating the
total of 6.8 billion people living on earth by up to "10 to 15%" using both
of his heavily funded vaccine and contraception programs that will render
much of the global population infertile.
Meanwhile, billionaire Ted Turner went
even further, offering his public opinion to decrease the world population
by 70% down to "two billion." It too is on tape.
Calls to begin sterilizing the human population
began surfacing back in the mid-1970's with
Henry Kissinger as former
Secretary of State and high ranking
Bilderberg member in his declassified
National Security Council document
NSSM
200 (1974) entitled "The Implications of World-wide
Population Growth on the Security and External Interests of the
United States."
This document emphasized highest priority given
to implementing birth control programs targeting thirteen Third World
nations mostly in South America.
Extraordinary resources were allocated
through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) pushing the
carrot stick of additional financial aid to countries willing to enact
sterilization and depopulation programs.
More overt evidence of the callous contempt that
globalist oligarchs have toward us 99%-ers is captured in a statement
written by Prince Phillip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband
in the forward of
his book,
"I must confess that I am tempted to ask for
reincarnation as a particularly deadly virus" to reduce the human
population.
It seems readily discernable that an explicit
globalist agenda for
a New World Order openly propagated with repeated
references by President
George Bush senior includes depopulation through
various means, water control through privatization just one of many in the
power elite's arsenal.
Humans have been dying from lack of clean water
for a long time now and will only continue dying at an even greater
frequency if the plan to privatize water continues to unfold unchecked and
without opposition.
Fortunately forces have been mobilizing to combat water
privatization.
Just last week on the heels of the World Bank
annual convening in Washington DC for several days of
conferencing,
an international coalition of anti-privatization water rights groups from
India and America sent a formal message calling on the World Bank to end its
destructive practice of privatizing water around the world under the guise
of developmental progress.
The Bank's DC meetings had been touting lies and
disinformation in an attempt to paint a glowing report showcasing the so
called efficacy and successes that turning water rights over to the private
sector have accomplished in recent years.
The World Bank's International Finance
Corporation (IFC) as the planet's largest funding source for water
privatization provides loans and financing to Third World nations for
private water management companies to take charge of municipal, regional and
national water rights.
The director of a global advocacy group called Corporate
Accountability International, Shayda Naficy, pointed out that 75%
of expenses for running a water utility company should go to infrastructure.
In nation after nation private companies have
placed the priority of making a profit over the need to invest in necessary
infrastructure to connect and adequately service water customers. In efforts
to maximize cost efficiency as well as profits, water prices invariably go
up and fast become out of reach for poorest customers.
Cutting off the water supply to thousands of low
income families unable to pay for their rising costs has become the all too
frequent inevitable result.
The World Bank's 34
percent failure rate for all private water and sewerage contracts
between 2000 and 2010 far surpasses its single digit failure rates in the
telecommunications, energy and transportation industries.
Critics maintain
that the public sector is far more accountable to its public constituents
than private sector businesses that only answer to its board of directors to
show sufficient profits. Corruption becomes commonplace.
Additionally, a conflict of interest exists when
the IFC acts as both a money lender and consultant to foreign municipalities
in assigning no bid contracts to favored private water utility companies.
To best illustrate typical scenarios where water
privatization is either not working or already proved a failure deserve
close examination.
The good news is that in recent years people in various
parts of the world have been mobilizing successful efforts and campaigns to
stop water privatization in their own backyards. Presently in a number of
regions in India, citizens are banding together to confront and fight the
myriad of problems with water privatization in their country.
Recently in Nagpur, central India's largest city
where the country's first municipal partnership with
a private utility company is being played out, major tensions have erupted.
Three years ago the city signed a 25-year
contract with Veolia Water to supply the city of 2.7 million residents with
24 hour-7-days a week water service. Instead unforeseen delays driving up
prices manyfold along with unfair water distribution and frequent service
breakdowns have led to widespread angry protests in the streets and charges
of corruption.
City officials point to a series of serious
contract violations. Again cutting corners by refusing to invest in the
needed infrastructure appears to be the primary cause for this failed
project.
The Corporate Accountability International's
2012 report called "Shutting
the Spigot on Private Water - The Case for the World Bank to Divest"
cites a number of similar cases where privatization has proven ineffective.
Bold and empowered citizens in Bolivia in the
year 2000 made headlines
around the globe when they were victorious in kicking out
privatized water there in the form of the Bechtel, the fifth largest private
corporation on the planet.
Impassioned protestors in Bolivia's
third-largest city managed to oppose Bechtel's increasing prices and
demanded that the company abandon its hold on their city's municipal water
supply, eventually driving the powerful scandalous giant out of the country.
Though big business efforts to buy and control
water rights in many Latin American nations have each had their turn in
nations like Ecuador and Brazil, only Chile water services are privatized.
Ultimately local residents virtually everywhere privatization has attempted
to take hold has been met with such strong resistance from consumers who
realize their private utility company has failed miserably in delivering
quality service at affordable prices.
The story is always the same. That is why
advocacy groups like Corporate Accountability International is proactively
working toward educating governments and citizens worldwide to ensure water
remains under the public domain.
The exhaustive and expensive legal process
of ending long term contracts and successfully removing privatized foreign
corporations once established in a city, state or country is formidable. It
is obviously in the best interests of people around the world to ensure
privatization of their water supply never gets a local foothold in the first
place.
Nestlé corporation's
marketing campaign targeted wealthy Pakistanis in Lahore, and its brand of
bottled water Pure Life' became a status symbol for the rich.
To bottle its product, Nestlé busily dried up
local underground springs that subsequently caused the village poor unable
to buy the bottled water stolen from their springs to end up consuming
contaminated water. Nestlé went on to extracting water from two deep wells
in Bhati Dilwan village, forcing them to turn to bottled water.
A similar story emerged from Nigeria where a
single bottled water exceeds the average daily income of a Nigerian citizen.
Nestlé is notorious for draining local water
supplies used to bottle its water brands, then charge unaffordable prices to
the local population whose clean water supply was stolen from them.
Corporate Watch released
a report exposing some of the
unethical and illegal practices that Nestlé
has long been committing around the globe, completely disregarding public
health concerns while destroying natural environments to ensure huge annual
profits of $35 billion just from water bottle sales alone.
In Brazil's Serra da Mantiqueira region where
the groundwater is rich in mineral content containing medicinal properties,
over-pumping has depleted its valuable water resources and caused permanent
damage to the natural environment. and long-term damage.
Nestlé has also allegedly been involved in human
trafficking of child slave
labor.
A BBC investigative report claimed that,
"hundreds of thousands of children in Mali,
Burkina Faso and Togo were being purchased from their destitute parents
and shipped to the Ivory Coast to be sold as slaves to cocoa farms."
Yet Nestlé likely bought the cocoa from the
Ivory Coast and Ghana knowing it was produced using child slaves.
Finally, Nestlé owns or leases fifty
spring sites throughout America. Nestlé controls a third of the
domestic market for bottled water in the US. The company is notorious for
unlawful extraction of spring water while engaging in price-gouging and
reeking havoc in numerous communities.
An example of the trouble Nestlé typically
causes is Colorado where 80% of the citizens of Aurora were opposed to
Nestlé's presence, fully aware of the company's terrible reputation for
damaging communities and natural environments. Yet the city council voted in
favor 7 to 4 to let the devastation begin and over the next decade Nestlé
extracted 650 million gallons of precious Arkansas River valley water that
went into its Arrowhead Springs brand of bottled water.
For years the embattled townspeople of Aurora
fought to rid the company predator from destroying their precious aquifers.
Additionally, the plastic non-biodegradable bottles are major pollutants
that stay toxically intact for a full millennium.
The cumulative grave
effects of privatizing water as a global commodity are appalling.
The underprivileged residents of Jakarta, Manila and Nairobi pay 5 to 10
times more for water than those living in high-income areas of those same
cities.
People living in the Third World (Developing
Countries) slums even pay
more for water than upscale New Yorkers and Londoners. This kind of
unfairness and inequity is obscene. Women in places in Africa where
privatized water is beyond their limit walk miles to obtain dirty water from
rivers and then too often die along with their children from contamination
and disease.
Asian farmers are losing their livelihoods if
they are unable to receive state funded irrigation. The human suffering
caused globally by wealthy private corporations from North America and
Europe exploiting people from Third World nations for pure profit is nothing
less than pure psychopathic evil.
Taking on global privatization of water for the
well being and greater good of the people is but an example of the
monumental work that needs to be done.
Only if informed, caring and
committed human beings collectively come together worldwide to take a global
stand against this gravest of life and death issues facing humanity can this
oligarch agenda be stopped dead in its tracks.
As global human rights activists it is up to us
to end the global corporate malevolence and malfeasance from further
damaging and afflicting our planet like never before.
With the recent formal finding that
Americans no
longer live in a democracy but an oligarchy, as if we did not already
painfully know, it becomes even more "formally" imperative now that we as
ordinary citizens of the world take the vested interest in preserving life
on our only planet before it becomes too late.
It is high time we take back our planet once and
for all from the oligarchic corporatocracy bent on insidiously making our
earthly home increasingly uninhabitable for all life forms.
Mass extinction of plant and animal species that
have thrived on this planet for millions of years is silently, invisibly
taking place every single day right before our eyes.
At ever-perilous stake now is our own human
species as well as all living species inhabiting this earth, suffering at
the hands of national governments that have corruptly co-opted with
the
banking cabal-owned transnational corporations and for too many decades been
systematically destroying the richly diverse natural ecosystems of all
earthly life forms on an unprecedented scale.
Since governmental co-opting with global fortune
500 corporations has been polluting and poisoning the earth's skies, its
waters, food sources and seeds for so long, global theft and destruction has
us humans and all life forms teetering now on the brink of complete
self-annihilation and extinction, human-induced for the first time on a
massive never before seen scale.
It is time to hold the oligarchy in the form of
corporations responsible for all the damage they have reeked on this earth.
No more grotesque "Obama-nations" of bank and Wall Street bailouts at
taxpayer expense.
Since the 99% in debt to the hilt have been
squeezed dry, while the 1% have made this planet nearly unlivable as the
only ones filthily richly profiting from their plundering this earth, the
transnationals are the sole entities with the financial capital and means to
clean up the very mess they created.
It is only fair then that after an entire
century of mucking the planet up at our expense, that
'they' now need to
finally be held accountable for repairing the destruction they directly
caused and obscenely profited from.
How Much is That Bottle of Water?

"Water promises to be to the 21st century
what oil was to the 20th century:
the precious commodity that determines
the wealth of nations"
- New York Press -
It is the 21st century and according to UNICEF statistics
783 million people do not have access to safe drinking water. Each day at
least 5,000 children die from preventable water and sanitation-related
diseases.
The world is plummeting towards a situation of
extreme water scarcity.
Indeed, between now and 2025, it is expected that we will need 17% more
water to produce food for the swelling populace of developing countries.
Meanwhile, total water consumption will increase disproportionately by some
40%. In optimal conditions, the average human being can survive up to a
maximum of six days without drinking water.
The rising levels of pollution, steadily
expanding populations and unprecedented climate change, however, have
combined to make the conditions we thrive in far from optimal. The odds are
daunting.
And as we summersault into a future in which
access to clean drinking water promises to be uncertain, new talking points
are developing. Among the many intriguing questions that are being asked
today, one,
"Is drinking water a commodity or a human
right?" takes centre stage.
The fundamental role played by water in the
sustenance of all life forms is obvious: water is life.
Thus, it is natural to assume that people
shouldnt have to pay a price for this basic right. Unfortunately, the real
state of affairs is far from the ideal, which is that clean drinking water
should not have to be bought under any circumstances.
The
United Nations (UN) sustained a series of dialogues spanning
multiple decades on this issue.
The result was that binding resolutions were
passed in 2010 declaring,
"the human right to safe drinking water and
sanitation is derived from the right to an adequate standard of living
and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard
of physical and mental health, as well as the right to life and human
dignity."
Water facilitates the provision of other
fundamental human rights, thus to deprive people of access to clean water is
to impose limitations on their right to live.
It is unfortunate, that we as human beings are not able to justly exercise
our right to water.
-
On the one hand, countries with greater
wealth and access to water sources have the tendency to overuse,
waste and pollute these bodies
-
While on the other, there are millions
of people who are completely deprived of clean water.
85% of the worlds population lives in the
driest regions of the world, among which are some of the poorest and most
vulnerable African countries.
Due to the varying degrees of access to clean
water and the resultant water conflicts, the stage has been set on a global
level for water to be viewed as a commodity - a scarce economic good that
must be rationed - rather than a basic human right.
The commodification of water appears to have risen significantly in the 20th
century, in line with mounting fears of water scarcity and environmental
degradation. Moreover, the provision of water as a public good has been
found to be inefficient and ineffective in certain circumstances, leaving
people with no choice but to purchase water for consumption as they do other
commodities.
This transition, marked in the recent past, has
its roots in the neoclassical idea of giving a good or service an economic
value in order to prevent their exploitation.
This new market approach governs water
consumption in the contemporary world. As expected, however, the shift has
sparked much controversy and debate among a wide range of stakeholders.
The wave of demonstrations, police violence and public uprising against
water prices
in Cochamba, Bolivia in the year 2000,
suggests the potential extent to which violence may escalate if water is to
be privatized and traded as a commodity rather than a public good.
Yet, some critics like K. Bakker argue
that trading water leads to a more efficient allocation of the scarce
resource.
However, the efficiency of these water markets
and the impact they may have on both society and the environment can be
questioned.
The system undoubtedly has flaws; and this is
further illustrated by self-interested profit makers,
such as Nestlé, exploiting their powers to maximize their own
gains from water selling.
Nestlés marketing campaign targeted affluent
Pakistanis in Lahore, with branded Pure Life water which became a status
symbol for the rich.
The poor were exposed to the ill effects of
consuming contaminated water and left to contend with the dilemma of dried
up springs in their villages. Whats more, Nestle has bitten them directly
by usurping the water supply and extracting water from two deep wells in
Bhati Dilwan village.
Thus, they too are forced to turn to bottled
water.
A similar story springs from Nigeria, where a
single bottle of Pure Brand is more expensive than the average daily
income of a Nigerian citizen. In other words,
"water has become the new oil".
Sadly, many companies that privatize water are
driven by the awareness that the rich will buy bottled water to stay in
fashion, and the poor because they need to survive.
Further support for the increasing consumerism
of drinking water comes from a study released in 2011which was carried out
by the Inter-American Development Bank showing that Mexicans used
approximately 127 gallons of bottled water per person per year, the highest
in the world.
A grave repercussion of the water problem is the
unfair choice that many underprivileged persons are forced to make ("to buy
or not to buy?"), which is a consequence of the inverse relationship that
exists between health and poverty for them.
To put a price on water for conservation and management purposes is
understandable. To make a commodity the defining factor in whether a person
lives or dies can be, and is, greatly disputed. Depriving a person of a
basic right to life because they cannot pay for it is unethical on several
levels.
Treating water as a commodity and the privatization of water will continue
to yield negative effects, especially for the poor.
Statistics imply that water as a commodity is,
and will continue to be, manipulated by the rich, powerful or water abundant
regions of the world. People living in the slums of Jakarta, Manila and
Nairobi already pay 5 to 10 times more for water than those living in
high-income areas in the same cities; a sum that is shockingly, even more
than that paid by consumers in New York or London.
Women in Africa prefer to walk long distances to
fetch dirty water from rivers rather than to pay for clean water, while
farmers in Asia will soon be unable to sustain their livelihoods if they do
not receive state-funded irrigation.
Thus, instead of moving progressively forward in
a struggle for survival, the majority of the worlds population is being
forced to step back.
While it is important to ponder over the debate on treating water as a
commodity or a right, we must not shy away from asking whether water can be
"owned" at all. The broader picture is that economic neo-liberalism has done
a lot of damage to our commons, including water. In reality, water and
property rights dont mix.
Rather than talking in the dualist language of
"rights" vs. "commodity", we ought to spell out our responsibilities.
This is undeniable and should encourage us to
seek a water-management regime around water as a commons (for humans as well
as for other species in the biosphere), not as a commodity. Thinking about
water as a commons is an important part of maintaining a stable and healthy
environment for both humanity and biodiversity.
Such an approach advocates sustainable consumption, a stable or reducing
population, high levels of reuse and recycling and no net loss of soil or
biodiversity. This requires a radical change in outlook and our consumption,
our technology choices and our population numbers in order to live within
the means of the planet.
We must tackle all three if our children and
grandchildren are to have a decent life.
