At least 13 very powerful underground explosions
rocked the United States Midwest in the last 48 hours.
They registered as small shallow earthquakes
with the USGS.
Many of the underground high explosive
detonations registered as 2.6 magnitude earthquakes. The U.S. military is
said to be sealing off the tunnels so that the Globalists and the U.S. ghost
government (Federal Reserve Bankers,
FEMA, DHS,
CIA) cant run and hide from
what is predicted to occur within 48 hours of September 27, 2011.
Officers in the U.S. military didnt seem to be aware of Obama and the
Globalists planned converging on Denver for a DEFCON 1 (nuclear war
imminent) cocked pistol drill.
An email was sent to the U.S. Air Force Office
of Special Investigations on September 21, 2011 to alert them to planned
false flag nuclear detonations on U.S. soil in the American Midwest. The
U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations were the ones who raided
Citadel Gun and Safe Store in Las Vegas on August 21, 2011 to recover stolen
nuclear warhead detonators.
They were the ones who intercepted the transfer
of improvised nuclear warheads by
the CIA in the tunnels that connected the
Deep Underground Military Bases on August 23, 2011.
The improvised nuclear bombs (W54 style
warheads) were being transferred via those tunnels to Washington DC and New
York City when they detonated during a firefight between U.S. military
personnel and CIA/DHS/FEMA operatives.
It would appear that the U.S. military had a deadline to meet and has
already damaged, destroyed or sealed at least 13 underground tunnels or
bases.
Perhaps their incentive was the fact that Obama,
his shadow government and the Globalists made plans to save their own hides
and leave the rest of use to fend for ourselves.
Perhaps they investigated and confirmed that
another false flag nuclear detonation was imminent and acted accordingly to
prevent it.
