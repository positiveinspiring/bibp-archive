NIA hasn't written about the whole debt ceiling issue over the past few
weeks because in our minds it is completely irrelevant.
Our elected representatives in Washington along
with the mainstream media have been wasting thousands of hours of time and
hundreds of millions of dollars debating a topic that has no meaning at all.
The President, Senate, and House of
Representatives are putting on a show to make it look like they care about
cutting spending and balancing the budget.
Except for a select few elected representatives
like Ron Paul who care about protecting the U.S. Constitution
and preserving what little purchasing power the U.S. dollar still has left,
every other politician in Washington is putting on a complete charade in
order to trick their constituents into believing there is a difference
between the proposals from the Republicans and Democrats.
While our incompetent and corrupt mainstream media has been proclaiming
there are major differences between the two bills proposed by House Speaker
John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, NIA
believes John Boehner might as well be a Democrat and Harry Reid could
easily pass himself off as a Republican.
There are absolutely no meaningful fundamental
differences between Boehner's plan that was approved by the House of
Representatives yesterday evening, before being killed by the Senate two
short hours later, and Reid's bill, which was just rejected by the House
today in a pre-emptive vote before the Senate even had a chance to vote on
it.
Both bills are estimated to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by approximately
$900 billion over the next 10 years.
Of the $900 billion only about $750 billion are
actual discretionary spending cuts with the rest being an expected reduction
in interest payments on the national debt as a result of either bill
passing.
When you have an unstable fiat currency
that is rapidly losing its purchasing power and could collapse at any time,
it is impossible to accurately project what our budget deficits will be 5 or
6 years from now, let alone 9 or 10 years from today. As far as the next two
fiscal years are concerned, both proposed bills from Boehner and Reid are
estimated to only cut spending by a total of about $70 billion in fiscal
years 2012 and 2013 combined.
The budget that former President
Bush submitted to Congress in early-2007, projected the
deficit to decline in each of the following four fiscal years. Not only did
the deficit not decline the next four years in a row, but it nearly tripled
in 2008 and from there more than tripled in 2009.
Shockingly, Bush's budget actually projected a
$61 billion surplus in fiscal year 2012, but instead we will have a budget
deficit of $1.1 trillion based on President
Obama's
latest budget, which takes into account unrealistic GDP growth next year
of 4.86%.
U.S. GDP growth for the first quarter of 2011 was just revised down
yesterday by 81% from 1.91% to 0.36%.
The advance estimate of second quarter GDP
growth came in at 1.28%, well below the consensus estimate of 1.8%. NIA is
going to really go out on a limb and predict that second quarter GDP growth
will soon be revised downward as well. If this is the highest GDP growth the
U.S. could muster after the Federal Reserve's $600 billion in QE2 money
printing, this should prove once and for all that monetary inflation does
not create real economic growth and employment.
The U.S. Treasury as of Thursday night had $51.6 billion in cash, with its
cash position declining by $15.2 billion during the previous 24 hours.
It expects to bring in $172.4 billion from
August 3rd through August 31st in tax receipts, but is scheduled to pay out
$306.7 billion during this time period for an estimated deficit of $134.3
billion.
The U.S. is scheduled to make its next interest
payment on the national debt on August 15th and it will equal
approximately $30 billion.
Over the last 9 months the U.S. has spent a
total of $385.9 billion on interest payments on the national debt, which
means it is on track to spend a record $514.5 billion this year on interest
payments alone.
Just a tiny 30 basis point increase in the
interest rate on the national debt would totally wipe out the deficit
reductions proposed by both Boehner and Reid.
The U.S. Treasury has been able to pay its bills in recent weeks by using
many different accounting gimmicks. However, come Tuesday, there will be no
more accounting tricks left to play and the U.S. won't be able to meet all
of its obligations.
Without a raise in the debt ceiling, the U.S.
government will have to prioritize who it pays using the tax receipts coming
in, which will probably include the,
-
$30 billion interest payment on the
national debt (to avoid a default)
-
$49.2 billion in Social Security
payments
-
$50 billion in Medicare/Medicaid
payments
-
$31.7 billion in defense payments
-
$12.8 billion in unemployment benefits
With $23 billion of the $49.2 billion in Social
Security payments due to be paid on August 3rd and $59 billion in
t-bills due on August 4th, the U.S. Treasury's remaining cash
balance could dissipate very quickly.
The 10-year bond yield reached a new 2011 low yesterday of 2.785%, its
lowest level since November 30th of last year. It is approaching
its record low of 2.08% from December of 2008 during the middle of the
financial crisis.
With threats of a U.S. debt default making
headlines across the world, investors are once again rushing into U.S. bonds
as a safe haven. It is almost as if the whole world has gone insane. The
world is fearful of the U.S. government defaulting on its debt and not being
able to pay off maturing bonds, so as a safe haven let's just all rush into
the very asset that will soon be worthless due to either an honest default
or default by inflation.
The U.S. dollar bubble is the largest and
longest running bubble in world history and U.S. bonds are currently
mispriced big time. U.S. dollar-denominated bonds should be the last asset
in the world to benefit from fears of a U.S. debt default.
One positive sign that NIA members are having
success at spreading our message to the world is that,
-
gold reached a new all time high
yesterday (July 29, 2011), rising $15 to $1,631 per ounce
-
silver rising $0.31 to $40.10 per ounce
Thanks to the efforts of NIA members who worked
tirelessly to spread the word about NIA's economic documentaries including 'Meltup',
'The
Dollar Bubble', and 'Hyperinflation
Nation', a larger percentage of the global population than ever
before is educated about the global currency crisis that is ahead.
During the financial crisis of late-2008/early-2009, gold and silver prices
declined along with all other assets.
Today, NIA estimates that half of the world's
investors seeking a safe haven are buying dollar-denominated assets like
U.S. Treasuries and the other half are seeking safety in precious metals. By
mid-2012, investors will most likely no longer look at U.S. bonds and other
dollar-denominated assets as a safe haven.
During future times of uncertainty, NIA believes
that precious metals will receive nearly 100% of safe haven buying, just
like the U.S. dollar received 100% of safe haven buying in
late-2008/early-2009.
Once the debt ceiling is inevitably raised, the U.S. Treasury will have a
lot of catching up to do in order to get its house in order, and we will
likely see the largest amount of debt ever sold by the U.S. government in a
single month. With QE2 having finished at the end of June, the U.S. will be
relying on foreigners in these upcoming record Treasury auctions. In our
opinion, we are likely going to see interest rates rise at an unprecedented
rate that will shock the world.
Don't believe the mainstream media's laughable claim that there is a
shortage of U.S. Treasuries. It was just reported yesterday that Cambodia,
one of the most rapidly growing emerging market economies with GDP growth
this year of 6.5%, is moving away from the U.S. dollar, which currently
accounts for 90% of their currency in circulation, in favor of its own
currency the riel.
NIA believes it is only a matter of time until
China ends its currency peg with the U.S. dollar. The world is flooded with
trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasuries that will soon have no buyers except
the
Federal Reserve.
There is no chance of yields falling below
record lows from December of 2008.
The mainstream media has been reporting all week that if the U.S. defaults
on its debt as a result of a failure to raise the debt ceiling, it will be
the first time that our nation has defaulted on its debt obligations. Most
NIA members know that the real U.S. debt default already occurred in 1971
when President Nixon closed the gold window and stopped allowing foreign
governments to convert their U.S. dollar holdings into gold.
Since then, the U.S. currency system has been
completely fiat and the national debt has increased by 3,400%.
For the past 40 years, the U.S. government has been running on fumes left
over from when countries were able to convert their paper U.S. dollars into
gold. The price of gold has increased by 3,900% during this time period,
meaning the U.S. dollar has lost 97.5% of its purchasing power. Meanwhile,
the median household income has only increased by 384%. In terms of gold,
the median U.S. household is earning 87.9% less income today than they did
in 1971.
The U.S. debt default of 1971 was many times
more significant than the pending debt default, because back then our
foreign creditors expected to receive real money and not a piece of paper
with no real value that we print.
The average American family has experienced a
dramatic decline in its standard of living since 1971. The U.S. dollar and
its reserve currency status is currently serving as the last thread that is
keeping our "house of cards" economy propped up.
The U.S. debt ceiling is very similar to a publicly traded company's
authorized shares. When a public company consistently loses money like the
U.S. government does, they print new shares just like the Federal Reserve
prints dollars and when its total outstanding shares reach the shares
authorized, the company's Board of Directors simply raises the shares
authorized, which allows it to continue issuing shares and diluting
shareholders.
Since 1962, the U.S. has raised its debt ceiling
74 times. Any public company that needed to raise its authorized shares 74
times would likely have seen its stock price decline by 99.99% from above
$10 to below 1 penny.
NIA is strongly against an increase in the debt ceiling because there are
ways for our country to stay afloat and continue operating without getting
deeper into debt.
The U.S. is currently supposed to have 8,133.5
tonnes of
gold reserves at Fort Knox. We don't know for sure
if these gold reserves still exist because the last audit of our gold
reserves took place in 1954 and we had the little minor issue of our real
debt default in 1971.
Assuming that all of our gold is still there,
this gold is worth $426.5 billion at the present time, enough to cover our
U.S. government's deficit spending for almost four whole months. The U.S.
government also owns valuable land, buildings, monuments, and other types of
Real Estate, that could also be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
Although we don't support selling all of our
gold and Real Estate, if the U.S. government isn't going to implement real
spending cuts that will lead to a balanced budget, we rather sell our assets
than see the dollar-denominated savings and incomes of all Americans lose
its purchasing power.
If we continue raising the debt ceiling and getting deeper into debt in
order to pay back the debts we already have, we are defaulting on our
debts through inflation. With gold at a record high of $1,631 per ounce, the
market is clearly telling us that a default through inflation is coming.
As the Chinese, Japanese, and our other
creditors are paid back in U.S. dollars that are rapidly losing their
purchasing power, they will be reluctant to increase their purchases of U.S.
Treasuries in the future, which we desperately need them to do in order to
fund our spending increases.
With the Federal Reserve likely to become the
Treasury buyer of last resort, the world will lose their confidence in
the U.S. dollar and hyperinflation could potentially break out as soon
as 2013.
NIA believes it is very likely that U.S. GDP will begin declining again in
late-2011, which will officially put the U.S. in double-dip recession
territory. In our opinion, the U.S. is still in the early stages of a
hyperinflationary depression and the so-called economic recovery reported by
the government and mainstream media has been completely phony and only due
to misleading and manipulated economic statistics that don't factor in the
real rate of U.S. price inflation.
We expect
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to do everything in
his power to avoid a double-dip recession at all costs.
By the end of 2011, we are confident that not only will we see QE3 under a
new name, but the Fed will act to force banks to lend their $1.6 trillion in
excess reserves.
It is a joke that we are debating spending cuts
of $70 billion over the next two years, when only very dramatic across the
board spending cuts of 50% or more of the total budget will give the U.S.
any hope of balancing the budget and avoiding hyperinflation.
Best case scenario, if the U.S. government cuts
spending by 50% or more in all areas of the budget including entitlement
programs and is able to prevent hyperinflation, NIA still believes we will
see the U.S. dollar lose 90% of its purchasing power this decade with the
price of gold rising to above $16,000 per ounce.
Important Debt Ceiling Update
August 01, 2011
from
NIA
Website
President Obama just announced late this evening that a deal has been
reached to cut government spending and raise the debt ceiling in order to
avoid a debt default.
If the deal is approved on Monday, it will raise
the debt ceiling by between $2.1 and $2.4 trillion in three installments:
-
$400 billion immediately
-
$500 billion this fall subject to a
disapproval vote by Congress
-
$1.2 to $1.5 trillion more after a
special committee agrees on a matching amount of spending cuts that
will be in addition to $900 billion in spending cuts proposed in the
bill
With no tax increases included in this plan, all
of this additional debt will eventually be monetized and paid for through
monetary inflation.
Although the deal is supposed to cut as much as $2.4 trillion in spending
over the next decade, Obama said that none of the spending cuts will occur
anytime soon so that not to derail the phony economic recovery. Thats
right, none of the cuts will come until early 2013 and by then we will need
to once again raise the debt ceiling to north of $20 trillion.
If our elected representatives were serious
about cutting spending, they would have the bulk of the spending cuts now
and not in the future when many of them will be out of office.
This deal is a complete and total sham, and will do nothing to prevent
hyperinflation. In no way will these spending cuts be mandated and nothing
will force future Congresses to abide by them. Even with these cuts,
government spending is going to increase every single year for the next
decade.
As price inflation spirals out of control in
the years ahead causing the purchasing power of the dollar to plummet,
all government employees will demand higher salaries and it will cost more
to run all parts of the government. Future Congresses will raise spending
and make the spending cuts proposed in this deal meaningless.
NIA believes that all of the events that took place in Washington this
weekend were scripted in advance. It is likely that both parties knew from
the beginning what deal they would ultimately agree to, but came out with
these other proposed bills in order to satisfy tea party supporters and make
them think that their efforts are making a difference.
The reality is, although the tea party movement
helped Republicans take over the House of Representatives so that Democrats
didnt have free rein in Washington, most of the new Republicans elected to
Congress havent followed through with their promises and have failed to
make any kind of a positive difference.
Everybody in Washington assumes that interest rates will remain at
artificially low levels for the rest of this decade.
The interest rate that the U.S. paid on its
total marketable debt in the month of June was only 2.38%. Exactly one
decade earlier, in June of 2001, we paid 6.162% interest on our total
marketable debt or 159% higher than current average interest rates. On
August 15th we owe our next interest payment of approximately $30
billion.
Imagine if that payment rises 159% higher to
$77.7 billion or $932.4 billion annualized.
Later this decade, interest rates will not only
rise back to normal levels like we had in 2001, but will likely rise to
artificially high levels to balance out the damage being created today from
artificially low interest rates.
If this bill is approved by Congress and the President on Monday, it will
avoid a short-term honest debt default but just about guarantee a default by
inflation later this decade. There is about a 1 in 1,000 chance that future
Congresses will stick with the spending cuts in this bill, but even if they
do, rising interest payments will not only wipe out the $2.4 trillion in
spending cuts, but they will add trillions more to future deficits and the
national debt.
A new Gallup Poll shows that 53% of Americans
oppose raising the debt ceiling compared to only 37% who favor an increase.
We pray that millions of Americans march to
Washington tomorrow in protest of this bill and that millions more call,
email, and fax their elected representatives in the morning demanding that
they vote no.
