In 2014 al-Qa'ida-type groups
are numerous and powerful
In other words, the 'war on terror' has
demonstrably failed
It is now 12-and-a-half
years since the
September 11 attacks that
put al-Qa'ida firmly on the map of global terrorism.
The US has spent billions of
dollars on its 'war
on terror' to counter the threat and succeeded in
killing Osama bin Laden three years ago.
And yet al-Qa'ida-type groups
are arguably stronger than ever now, especially in Syria and
Iraq where they control an area the size of Britain, but
also in Libya, Lebanon, Egypt and beyond.
In a groundbreaking five-part series, The Independent's
award-winning foreign correspondent, Patrick Cockburn,
investigates the resurgence of the terrorist organization.
Today, he asks: why did the 'war
on terror' go wrong?
Al-Qa'ida-type organizations, with beliefs and
methods of operating similar to those who carried out the 9/11 attacks, have
become a lethally powerful force from the Tigris to the Mediterranean in the
past three years.
Since the start of 2014, they have held
Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad, much of the upper Euphrates valley, and
exert increasing control over the Sunni heartlands of northern Iraq.
In Syria, their fighters occupy villages and
towns from the outskirts of Damascus to the border with Turkey, including
the oilfields in the north-east of the country. Overall, they are now the
most powerful military force in an area the size of Britain.
The spectacular resurgence of al-Qa'ida and its offshoots has happened
despite the huge expansion of American and British intelligence services and
their budgets after 9/11.
Since then, the US, closely followed by Britain,
has fought wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and adopted procedures formerly
associated with police states, such as imprisonment without trial,
rendition, torture and domestic espionage. Governments justify this as
necessary to wage the "war on terror", claiming that the rights of
individual citizens must be sacrificed to secure the safety of all.
Despite these controversial security measures, the movements against which
they are aimed have not only not been defeated but have grown stronger.
At the time of 9/11, al-Qa'ida was a very small
organization, but in 2014 al-Qa'ida-type groups are numerous and powerful.
In other words, the "war on terror", the waging of which determined the
politics of so much of the world since 2001, has demonstrably failed.
How this failure happened is perhaps the most extraordinary development of
the 21st century.
Politicians were happy to use the threat of al-Qa'ida
to persuade people that their civil liberties should be restricted and state
power expanded, but they spent surprisingly little time calculating the most
effective practical means to combat the movement. They have been able to get
away with this by giving a misleading definition of al-Qa'ida, which varied
according to what was politically convenient at the time.
Jihadi groups ideologically identical to al-Qa'ida are relabeled as moderate
if their actions are deemed supportive of US policy aims.
In Syria, the US is backing a plan by Saudi
Arabia to build up a "Southern Front" based in Jordan against the Assad
government in Damascus, but also hostile to al-Qa'ida-type rebels in the
north and east.
The powerful but supposedly "moderate" Yarmouk
Brigade, which is reportedly to receive anti-aircraft missiles from Saudi
Arabia, will be the leading element in this new formation.
But numerous videos show that the Yarmouk
Brigade has frequently fought in collaboration with Jabhat al-Nusra (JAN),
the official al-Qa'ida affiliate.
Since it is likely that, in the midst of battle,
these two groups will share their munitions, Washington will be permitting
advanced weaponry to be handed over to its deadliest enemy.
This episode helps explain why al-Qa'ida and its offshoots have been able to
survive and flourish. The "war on terror" has failed because it did not
target the jihadi movement as a whole and, above all, was not aimed at Saudi
Arabia and Pakistan, the two countries that had fostered jihadism as a creed
and a movement.
The US did not do so because they were important
American allies whom it did not want to offend. Saudi Arabia is an enormous
market for American arms, and the Saudis have cultivated and, on occasion
bought up, influential members of the American political establishment.
A measure of the seriousness of the present situation is that, in recent
weeks, Saudi Arabia has for the first time been urgently seeking to stop
jihadi fighters, whom it previously allowed to join the war in Syria, from
returning home and turning their weapons against the rulers of the Saudi
kingdom.
This is an abrupt reversal of previous Saudi
policy, which tolerated or privately encouraged Saudi citizens going to
Syria to take part in a holy war to overthrow President Bashar
al-Assad and combat Shia Muslims on behalf of Sunni Islam.
The now deposed Saudi Intelligence chief
Prince Bandar bin Sultan
In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has called on all
foreign fighters to leave Syria, and King Abdullah has decreed it a
crime for Saudis to fight in foreign conflicts.
The Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar
bin Sultan, who had been in charge of organizing, funding and supplying
jihadi groups fighting in Syria, has been unexpectedly removed from
overseeing Saudi policy towards Syria, and replaced by a prince who has led
a security clampdown against al-Qa'ida inside Saudi Arabia.
The US is increasingly fearful that support for the Syrian rebels by the
West and the Sunni monarchies of the Gulf has created a similar situation to
that in Afghanistan in the 1980s, when indiscriminate backing for insurgents
ultimately produced al-Qa'ida, the Taliban and jihadi warlords.
The US Under-Secretary for Terrorism and
Financial Intelligence, David Cohen, warned this month that
"terrorist" movements, such as JAN and the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant (Isis), were not only destabilizing Syria but,
"these well-funded and well-equipped groups
may soon turn their attention to attacks outside of Syria, particularly
as scores of newly radicalized and freshly trained foreign recruits
return from Syria to their home countries".
The number of foreign fighters that Mr Cohen
gives is a significant underestimate, since the head of US intelligence,
James Clapper, estimates foreign fighters in Syria to number about
7,000, mostly from the Arab world, but also from countries such as Chechnya,
France and Britain.
Al-Qa'ida has always been a convenient enemy. In Iraq, in 2003 and 2004, as
armed Iraqi opposition to the American and British-led occupation mounted,
US spokesmen attributed most attacks to al-Qa'ida, though many were carried
out by nationalist and Baathist groups.
According to a poll by the Pew Group, this
persuaded 57 per cent of US voters before the Iraq invasion to believe that
there was a connection between Saddam Hussein and those responsible for
9/11, despite a complete absence of evidence for this. In Iraq itself,
indeed the whole Muslim world, these accusations benefited al-Qa'ida by
exaggerating its role in the resistance to the US and British occupation.
Precisely the opposite PR tactics were employed by Western governments in
2011 in Libya, where they played down any similarity between al-Qa'ida and
the Nato-backed rebels fighting to overthrow the Libyan leader, Muammar
Gaddafi.
This was done by describing as dangerous only
those jihadis who had a direct operational link to the al-Qa'ida "core" of
Osama bin Laden.
The falsity of the pretence that the
anti-Gaddafi jihadis in Libya were less threatening than those in contact
with al-Qa'ida was forcefully, if tragically, exposed when US ambassador
Chris Stevens was killed by jihadi fighters in Benghazi in September
2012.
These were the same fighters lauded by
governments and media for their role in the anti-Gaddafi uprising.

Al-Qa'ida is an idea rather than an
organization, and this has long been so.
For a five-year period after 1996, it did have
cadres, resources and camps in Afghanistan, but these were eliminated after
the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001.
Subsequently, al-Qa'ida's name was a rallying
cry, a set of Islamic beliefs such as the creation of an Islamic state, the
imposition of sharia, a return to Islamic customs, the subjugation of women
and waging holy war against other Muslims, notably the Shia, as heretics
worthy of death.
At the centre of this doctrine for making war is
an emphasis on self-sacrifice and martyrdom as a symbol of religious faith
and commitment. This has turned out to be a way of using untrained but
fanatical believers to devastating effect as suicide bombers.
It has always been in the interests of the US and other governments that al-Qa'ida
should be viewed as having a command-and-control structure like a
mini-Pentagon, or the Mafia in America as shown in the Godfather films. This
is a comforting image for the public because organized groups, however
demonic, can be tracked down and eliminated through imprisonment or death.
More alarming is the reality of a movement whose
adherents are self-recruited and may spring up anywhere.
Osama bin Laden's gathering of militants, which he did not call al-Qa'ida
until after 9/11, was just one of many jihadi groups 12 years ago. But today
its ideas and methods are predominant among jihadis because of the prestige
and publicity it gained through the destruction of the twin towers, the war
in Iraq and its demonization by Washington as the source of all
anti-American evil.
These days, there is a decreasing difference in
the beliefs of jihadis, regardless of whether or not they are formally
linked to al-Qa'ida central, now headed by Ayman al-Zawahiri.
An observer in southern Turkey discussing 9/11
with a range of Syrian jihadi rebels earlier this year found that,
"without exception they all expressed
enthusiasm for the 9/11 attacks and hoped the same thing would happen in
Europe as well as the US".
"Osama bin Laden's death had no impact on al-Qa'ida-type jihadi groups,
whose greatest expansion has been since 2011"
Unsurprisingly, governments prefer the fantasy
picture of al-Qa'ida because it enables them to claim a series of victories
by killing its better-known members and allies.
Often, those eliminated are given quasi-military
ranks, such as "head of operations", to enhance the significance of their
demise. The culmination of this most publicized but largely irrelevant
aspect of the "war on terror" was the killing of Bin Laden in
Abbottabad in Pakistan in 2011.
This enabled President
Obama
to grandstand before the American public as the man who had presided over
the hunting down of al-Qa'ida's leader. In practice, his death had no
impact on al-Qa'ida-type jihadi groups, whose greatest expansion has been
since 2011.
The resurgence of these jihadis is most striking on the ground in Iraq and
Syria, but is evident in Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia and, in recent months,
Lebanon and Egypt.
In Iraq, it was a final humiliation for the US,
after losing 4,500 soldiers, that al-Qa'ida's black flag should once again
fly in Fallujah, captured with much self-congratulatory rhetoric by US
Marines in 2004.
Aside from Fallujah, Isis, the premier jihadi
movement in the country, has rapidly expanded its influence in all parts of
Sunni Iraq in the past three years. It levies local taxes and protection
money in Mosul, Iraq's third largest city, estimated to bring in $8m (£4.8m)
a month.
It has been able to capitalize on two factors:
Peaceful protests by Sunni started in December
2012, but a lack of concessions by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and
a massacre at a peace camp at Hawijah last April is transmuting peaceful
protest into armed resistance.
Last summer, Isis freed hundreds of its leaders and experienced militants in
a spectacular raid on Abu Ghraib prison. Its stepped-up bombing campaign
killed 9,500 people, mostly Shia civilians, in the course of last year, the
heaviest casualties since 2008. But there is a crucial difference between
then and now.
Even at the previous peak of its influence in
2004-06, al-Qa'ida in Iraq did not enjoy as strong a position in the Sunni
armed opposition as it does today.
Jessica D. Lewis, of the Institute for the Study of War,
commented in a study of the movement at the end of 2013 that al-Qa'ida in
Iraq,
"is an extremely vigorous, resilient and
capable organization that can operate from Basra to coastal Syria".
In Syria, Isis was the original founder in early
2012 of JAN, sending it money, arms and experienced fighters.
A year later, it tried to reassert its authority
over JAN by folding it into a broader organization covering both Syria and
Iraq. The two are now involved in a complicated intra-jihadi civil war that
began at the start of the year, pitting Isis, notorious for its cruelty and
determination to monopolize power, against the other jihadi groups.
The more secular Free Syrian Army (FSA), once
designated along with its political wing by the West as the next rulers of
Syria, has collapsed and been marginalized.
The armed opposition is now dominated by jihadis who wish to establish an
Islamic state, accept foreign fighters, and have a vicious record of
massacring Syria's minorities, notably the Alawites and the Christians.
The Islamic Front, for instance, a newly
established and powerful alliance of opposition brigades backed by Turkey
and Qatar, is fighting Isis. But that does not mean that it is not complicit
in sectarian killings, and it insists on strict imposition of sharia,
including the public flogging of those who do not attend Friday prayers.
The Syrian jihadis rule most of north-east Syria
aside from that part of it held by the Kurds. The government clings to a few
outposts in this vast area, but does not have the forces to recapture it.
The decisions that enabled al-Qa'ida to avoid elimination, and later to
expand, were made in the hours immediately after 9/11. Almost every
significant element in the project to crash planes into the twin towers and
other iconic American buildings led back to Saudi Arabia. Bin laden was a
member of the Saudi elite, whose father had been a close associate of the
Saudi monarch.
Of the 19 hijackers on 9/11, 15 were Saudi
nationals.
Citing a CIA report of 2002, the official 9/11
report says that al-Qa'ida relied for its financing on,
"a variety of donors and fundraisers,
primarily in the Gulf countries and particularly in Saudi Arabia".
The report's investigators repeatedly found
their access limited or denied when seeking information in Saudi Arabia.
Yet President
George W Bush never considered holding the Saudis in any way
responsible for what had happened. The exit of senior Saudis, including Bin
Laden relatives, from the US was facilitated by the government in the days
after 9/11.
Most significantly, 28 pages of the 9/11
Commission Report about the relationship between the attackers and Saudi
Arabia was cut and never published - despite a promise by President Obama to
do so - on the grounds of national security.
Nothing much changed in Saudi Arabia until recent months.
In 2009, eight years after 9/11, a cable from
the US Secretary of State,
Hillary
Clinton, revealed by WikiLeaks, complains that,
"donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most
significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide".
Moreover, the US and the west Europeans showed
themselves indifferent to Saudi preachers, their message spread to millions
by satellite TV, YouTube and Twitter, calling for the killing of Shia as
heretics.
These calls came as al-Qa'ida bombs were
slaughtering people in Shia neighborhoods in Iraq.
A sub-headline in another State Department cable
in the same year reads:
"Saudi Arabia: Anti-Shi'ism As Foreign
Policy?"
Five years later, Saudi-supported groups have a
record of extreme sectarianism against non-Sunni Muslims.
Pakistan, or rather Pakistani military intelligence in the shape of the
Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), was the other parent of al-Qa'ida,
the Taliban and jihadi movements in general.
When the Taliban was disintegrating under the
weight of US bombing in 2001, its forces in northern Afghanistan were
trapped by anti-Taliban forces.
Before they surrendered, hundreds of ISI
members, military trainers and advisers were hastily evacuated by air.
Despite the clearest evidence of ISI's sponsorship of the Taliban and
jihadis in general, Washington refused to confront Pakistan, and thereby
opened the way for the resurgence of the Taliban after 2003, which neither
the US nor Nato has been able to reverse.
Al-Qa'ida, the Taliban and other jihadi groups are the offspring of,
-
America's strange alliance with Saudi
Arabia, a theocratic absolute monarchy
-
Pakistani military intelligence
If this alliance had not existed, then 9/11
would not have happened.
And because the US, with Britain never far
behind, refused to break with these two Sunni powers, jihadism survived and
prospered after 9/11.
Following a brief retreat, it took advantage of the turmoil created by wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan and, later, by the Arab uprisings of 2011, to expand
explosively.
Twelve years after the "war on terror" was
launched it has visibly failed and al-Qa'ida-type jihadis, once confined to
a few camps in Afghanistan, today rule whole provinces in the heart of the
Middle East.
