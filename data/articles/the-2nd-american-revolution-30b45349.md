The natives are restless. The third shot of the Second American Revolution
has been fired. History is being made. But just as with the first two shots,
the third shot is not being heard.
America is seething. Not since the Civil War has anything like this
happened.
But the protests are either being intentionally
downplayed or ignorantly misinterpreted.
-
The first shot was fired on April 15, 2009.
Over 700 anti-tax rallies and Tea Parties erupted nationwide. Rather
than acknowledge their significance, the general media either ignored or
ridiculed both protests and protestors, playing on tea bagging for its
sexual innuendo. Initially President
Obama said he was unaware of the
tea parties. The White House later warned they could mutate into
something unhealthy.
-
Shot #2 was fired on the Fourth of July,
when throngs of citizens across the nation gathered to again protest
taxation without representation. And as before, the demonstrations
were branded right-wing mischief and dismissed.
-
The third volley, fired in early August, was
aimed point blank at Senators and House members pitching President
Obamas health care reform package to constituents. In fiery town hall
meetings, enraged citizens shouted down their elected representatives.
It took a strong police presence and/or burly bodyguards to preserve a
safe physical space between the politicians and irate townspeople.
The White House and the media have labeled
protestors conservative fringe elements, or as players in staged events
organized by Republican operatives that have been egged on by Fox news and
right-wing radio show hosts.
In regard to this latest wave of outbursts, health industry interests
opposed to any reform are also being blamed for inciting the public. But
organized or spontaneous is not the issue. While most protestors exhibit
little grasp of the complex 1000 page health care reform document (that nary
a legislator has read either), their emotion is clearly real and un-staged.
Rightly or wrongly, the legislation is regarded as yet another straw on the
already overloaded camels back.
A series of gigantic, unpopular
government-imposed (but taxpayer-financed) bailouts, buyouts, rescue and
stimulus packages have been stuffed down the gullet of Americans. With no
public platform to voice their opposition, options for citizens have been
limited to fruitless petitions, e-mails and phone calls to Congress
all
fielded by anonymous staff underlings.
Now, with Congress in recess and elected representatives less than a stones
throw away, the public is exploding.
The devil is not in the details of the heath
care reform, the devil is the government mandating health care. Regardless
of how the plan is pitched or what is being promised, to the public the
legislation is yet another instance of big government taking another piece
out of their lives and making them pay for it; again telling them what they
can or cannot do.
Though in its early stages, the Second American Revolution is underway.
Yet, what we forecast will become the most
profound political trend of the century the trend that will change the
world is still invisible to the same experts, authorities and pundits who
didnt see the financial crisis coming until the bottom fell out of the
economy.
Trend Forecast
Conditions will continue to deteriorate. The
global economy is terminally ill.
The recession is in a brief remission, not the
early stages of recovery. Cheap money, easy credit and unrestrained
borrowing brought on an economic crisis that cannot be cured by monetary and
fiscal policies that promote more cheap money, easy credit and unrestrained
borrowing.
Nevertheless, Washington will continue to intervene, tax and exert control.
Protests will escalate and riots will follow.
Tens of millions will fight for their right to
remain free and
unvaccinated.
Editorial Note
The power of the Internet and new technologies
is inexorably fermenting the Second American Revolution.
However
widespread and emotionally charged, had the tax rallies, tea parties and
healthcare reform protests occurred in years past, they might have been
covered by the local media, but might not have made national headline news
and thus would have died stillborn.
Now, with the ubiquitous camera-equipped cell phone, universal access to
YouTube, and millions of twitters and tweets, the uprisings cannot be
ignored, contained, managed, spun or edited down.
The revolutionary fervor
will prove contagious.
Can anything stop it?
Trend Forecast
Before the momentum of the Second American
Revolution becomes unstoppable, it could be derailed through some false
flag event designed to deceive the public, or a genuine event or crisis
capable of rallying the entire nation behind the President.
In a worst-case scenario, according to Trends
Research Institute Director, Gerald Celente,
Given the pattern of governments to parlay
egregious failures into mega-failures, the classic trend they follow,
when all else fails, is to take their nation to war."
-
A false flag attempt
-
A genuine crisis
-
A
declaration of war,
...may slow the momentum of the Second American
Revolution, but nothing will stop it.
