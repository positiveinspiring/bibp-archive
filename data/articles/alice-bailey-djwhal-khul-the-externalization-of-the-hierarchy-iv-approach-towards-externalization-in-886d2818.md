# Alice Bailey & Djwhal Khul - The Externalization of the Hierarchy - IV -
Approach Towards Externalization in the Disciple's Consciousness

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/exter/exte1251.html

Disciples who are intensely interested in personal responsiveness to the soul, who work diligently at the problem of soul contact, who are busy with the art of serving consciously and who make service a goal, who are keenly alive to the fact of the Ashram and to the Master, will not be asked to do this work of preparing for the externalization of the Hierarchy. Advanced disciples who are stabilized in the Ashram, and who are so used to the Master that He assumes in their consciousness no undue prominence, can be trusted to work along right lines in the world and do the work of preparation. They cannot be sidetracked or deflected from one-pointed attention to the task in hand by any soul call or urge; hence they are free to do the intended work.
The situation, therefore, in relation to the consciousness of disciples in the intensely difficult, though interesting, period with which humanity is faced could be summed up in the following statements:
I am not here touching upon the growth of a disciple as a disciple, or on his individual progress on the Path; I am considering the type of consciousness with which he faces the task which confronts him. Unless he fulfils within himself the requirements enumerated in this section of our study, he will not be one of the workers in this interlude between the old age and the new.
