Research And Development
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO)
This regulation establishes the Air Force program for investigating
and analyzing UFOs over the United States. It provides for uniform
investigative procedures and release of information. The
investigations and analyses prescribed are related directly to the
Air Force's responsibility for the air defense of the United States.
The UFO Program requires prompt reporting and rapid evaluation of
data for successful identification. Strict compliance with this
regulation is mandatory.
SECTION A - GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. Explanation of Terms. To insure proper and uniform usage of
terms in UFO investigations, reports, and analyses, an explanation of
common terms follows:
-
Unidentified Flying Objects. Any aerial phenomenon or
object which is unknown or appears out of the ordinary to the
observer.
-
Familiar or Known Objects/Phenomena. Aircraft, aircraft
lights, astronomical bodies (meteors, planets, stars, comets, sun,
moon), balloons, birds fireworks, missiles, rockets, satellites,
searchlights, weather phenomena (clouds, contrails, dust devils), and
other natural phenomena.
2. Program Objectives. Air Force interest in UFOs is two-fold:
to determine if the UFO is a possible threat to the United States and
to use the scientific or technical data gained from study of UFO
reports. To attain these objectives, it is necessary to explain or
identify the stimulus which caused the observer to report his
observation as an unidentified flying object.
a. Air Defense. The majority of UFOs reported to the Air Force
have been conventional or familiar objects which present no threat to
our security.
-
It is possible that foreign countries may develop flying vehicles
of revolutionary configuration or propulsion.
-
Frequently, some alleged UFOs are determined to be aircraft. Air
Defense Command (ADC) is responsible for identification
This regulation supersedes AFR 200-2, 20 July 1962
OPR: AFRSTA
DISTRIBUTION: S
[[1291]]
of aircraft. Except as aircraft are determined to be the stimulus
for a UFO report, aircraft are not to be reported under the
provisions of this regulation.
b. Technical and Scientific. The Air Force will analyze
reports of UFOs submitted to it to attain the program objectives. In
this connection these facts are of importance:
-
The need for further scientific knowledge in geophysics,
astronomy, and physics of the upper atmosphere which may be provided
by study and analysis of UFOs and similar aerial phenomena.
-
The need to report all pertinent factors that have a direct
bearing on scientific analysis and conclusions of UFO sightings.
-
The need and the importance of complete case information.
Analysis has explained all but a small percentage of the sightings
which have been reported to the Air Force. The ones that have not
been explained are carried statistically as "unidentified." Because
of the human factors involved and because analysis of a UFO sighting
depends primarily on a personal impression and interpretation by the
observer rather than on scientific data or facts obtained under
controlled conditions, the elimination of of all unidentifeds is
improbable. However, if more immediate, detailed, and objective data
on the unidentifieds had been available and promptly reported,
perhaps these, too, could have been identified.
3. Program Responsibilities:
a. Program Monitor. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and
Development, is responsible for the overall program, evaluation of
investigative procedures, and the conduct of separate scientific
investigations.
b. Resources. The Air Force Systems Command will support the
program with current resources within the Foreign Technology Division
(FTD) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, to continue the
Project Blue Book effort. Other AFSC resources normally used by FTD
for this effort will. continue to be made available.
c. Investigation. Each commander of an Air Force base will
provide a UFO investigative capability. When notice of a UFO sighting
is received, an investigation will be implemented to determine the
stimulus for the sighting. An Air Force base receiving the notice of
a UFO sighting may not be the base nearest the locale of the
sighting. In that event, the reported UFO sighting will be referred
to the Air Force base nearest the sighting for action.
EXCEPTIONS: FTD at Wright - Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio,
independently or with the help of pertinent Air Force activities, may
conduct any other investigation to conclude its analysis or findings.
HQ USAF may arrange for separate investigations.
d. Analysis. FTD will:
-
Analyze and evaluate all information and evidence reported to
bases on those UFOs which are not identified at the base level.
-
Use other Government agencies, private industrial companies, and
contractor personnel to assist in analyzing and evaluating UFO
reports, as necessary.
e. Findings. FTD, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, will prepare a
final case report on each sighting reported to it after the data have
been properly evaluated. If the final report is deemed ,;ignificant,
FTD will send the report of its findings to AFSC (SCFA), Andrews AFB,
Wash DC 20331, which will send a report to HQ USAF (AFRDC), Wash DC
20330.
f. Cooperation. All Air Force activities will cooperate with
UFO investigators to insure that pertinent information relative to
investigations of UFO sightings are promptly obtained. When feasible,
this will include furnishing air or ground transportation and other
assistance.
SECTION B - PUBLIC RELATIONS, INFORMATION, CONTACTS, AND RELEASES
4. Response to Public Interest. The Secretary of the Air
Force, Office of Information (SAF-OI), maintains contact with the
public and the news media on all aspects of the UFO program and
related activities. Private individuals or organizations desiring Air
Force interviews, briefings, lectures, of private discussions on UFOs
will be instructed to direct their requests to SAF-OI Air Force
members not officially connected with UFO investigations covered by
this regulation will refrain from any action or comment on UFO
reports Which may mis lead or cause the public to construe these
opinions as official Air Force findings.
5. Releasing Information. SAF-OI is the agency responsible for
releasing information to the public and to the news media.
a. Congressional and Presidential Inquiries. The Office of
Legislative Liaison will:
-
With the assistance of SAF-OI, answer all Congressional and
Presidential queries regarding UFOs forwarded to the Air Force.
[[1292]]
-
Process requests from Congressional sources in accordance with AFR
11-7.
b. SAF-OI will:
-
Respond to correspondence from individuals requesting information on
the UFO Program and evaluations of sightings.
-
Release information on UFO sightings and results of investigations to
the general public.
-
Send correspondence queries which are purely technical and scientific
to FTD for information on which to base a reply.
c. Exceptions. In response to local inquiries regarding UFOs
reported in the vicinity of an Air Force base, the base commander may
release information to the news media or the public after the
sighting has been positively identified. If the stimulus for the
sighting is difficult to identify at the base level, the commander
may state that the sighting is under investigation and conclusions
will be released by SAF-OI after the investigation is completed. The
commander may also state that the Air Force will review and analyze
the results of the investigation. Any further inquiries will be
directed to SAF-OI
SECTION C - PREPARING AND SUBMITTING REPORTS
6. General Information:
a. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and Development, USAF and the
ADC have a direct and immediate interest in UFOs reported within the
US. All Air Force activities will conduct UFO investigations to the
extent necessary for reporting action (see paragraphs 9, 10, 11, and
12). Investigation may be carried beyond this point when the
preparing officer believes the scientific or public relations aspect
of the case war rants further investigation. In this case. the
investigator will coordinate his continued investigation with FTD.
b. Paragraph 7 will be used as a guide for screenings,
investigations, and reportings. Paragraph 11 is an outline of the
reporting format.
c. Inquiries should be referred to SAF-OI (see paragraph 5).
d. If possible, all individual selected as a UFO investigator should
have a scientific or technical background and experience as an
investigator.
e. Reports required by this regulation are excluded from assignment
of a reports control symbol in accordance with paragraph 3k, AFR
300-5.
7. Guidance in Preparing Reports. The usefulness of a UFO
report depends largely on accuracy, timeliness, skill and
resourcefulness of the person who receives the initial information
and makes the report. Following are aids for sereening, evaluating
and reporting sightings:
a. Activities receiving initial reports of aerial objects and
phenomena will screen the information to determine if the report
concerns a valid UFO as defined in paragraph ]a. Reports not falling,
within that definition do not require further action. Aircraft
flares, jet exhausts, condensation trails, blinking or steady lights
observed at night, lights circling near airports and airways, and
other aircraft phenomena should not be reported as they do not fall
within the definition of a UFO.
EXCEPTION: Reports of known objects will be made to FTD when
this information originally had been reported by local news media as
a UFO and the witness has contacted the Air Force. (Do NOT solicit
reports.) News releases should be included as an attachment with the
report (see paragraph 8c).
b. Detailed study will be made of the logic, consistency, and
authenticity of the observer's report. An interview with the
observer, by persons preparing the report, is especially valuable in
determining the reliability of the source and the validity of the
information. Factors for particular attention are the observer's age,
occupation, and education, and whether he has a technical or
scientific background. A report that a witness is completely familiar
with certain aspects of a sighting should indicate specific
qualifications to substantiate such familiarity.
c. The following procedures will assist the investigating officer
in completing the report and arriving at a conclusion as required in
paragraph 11.
-
When feasible, contact local aircraft control and warning (ACW)
units, and pilots and crews of aircraft aloft at the time and place
of sighting Contact any persons or organizations that may have
alditional data on the UFO or can verify evidence - visual,
electronic, or other.
-
Consult military or civilian weather forecasters for data on tracks
of weather balloons or any unusual meteorological activity that may
have a bearing on the stimulus for the UFO.
[[1293]]
-
Consult navigators and astronomers in the area to determine if any
astronomical body or phenomenon might account for the sighting.
- Consult military and civilian tower operators, air operations
units,, and airlines to determine if the sighting could have been an
aircraft. Local units of the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) can be of
assistance in this regard.
- Consult persons who may know of experimental aircraft of
unusual configuration, rocket and guided missile firings, or aerial
tests in the area.
- Consult local and State police, county sheriffs, forest
rangers, and other civil officials who may have been in the area at
the time of the sighting or have knowledge of other witnesses.
8. Transmittal of Reports:
a. Timeliness. Report all information on UFOs promptly. Electrical
transmission with a "Priority" precedence is authorized.
b. Submission of Reports. Submit multiple-addressed electrical
reports to:
- ADC.
- Nearest Air Division (Defense).
- FTD WPAFB. (First line of text: FOR TDETR.)
- CSAF. (First line of text: FOR AFRDC.)
- OSAF. (First line of text: FOR SAF-OI.)
c. Written Reports. In the event followup action requires a
letter report, send it to FTD (TDETR), Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
45433. FTD will send the reports to interested organizations in the
US and to SAF-OI if required.
d. Reports from Civilians. Advise civilians to report UFOs to the
nearest Air Force base.
e. Negative or Inapplicable Data. If specific information is
lacking, refrain from using the words "negative" or "unidentified"
unless all logical leads to obtain the information outlined in
paragraph 11 have been exhausted. For example, the information on
weather conditions in the area, as requested in paragraph 11g, is
obtainable from the local military or civilian weather facility. Use
the phrase "not applicable (NA)" only when the question really does
not apply to the sighting under investigation.
10. Comments of Investigating Officer. This officer will make
an initial analysis and comment on the possible cause or identity of
the stimulus in a supporting statement. He will make every effort to
obtain pertinent items of information and to test all possible leads,
clues, and hypotheses. The investigating officer who receives the
initial report is in a better position to conduct an on-the-spot
survey and follow-up than subsequent investigative personnel and
analysts who may be far removed from the area and who may arrive too
late to obtain vital data or information necessary for firm
conclusions. The investigating officer's comments and conclusions
will be in the last paragraph of the report submitted through
channels. The reporting official will contact FTD (Area Code 513,
257-0916 or 257-6678) for verbal authority to continue
investigations.
11. Basic Reporting Data and Format. Show the abbreviation
"UFO" at the beginning of the text of all electrical reports and in
the subject of any follow-up written reports. Include required data
in all electrical reports, in the order shown below:
a. Description of the Object(s):

Title radarscope photographic prints per AFR 95-7. Classify
radarscope photographs per AFR 205-1.
NOTE: if possible, develop film before forwarding. Mark
undeveloped film clearly to indicate this fact, to avoid destruction
by exposure through mail channels to final addressees.
b. Material. Air Force echelons receiving suspected or actual
UFO material will safeguard it to prevent any defacing or alterations
which might reduce its value for intelligence examination and
analysis.
c. Photographs, Motion Pictures and Negatives Submitted by
Individuals. Individuals often submit photographic and motion
picture material as part of their UFO reports. All original material
