A new report says mercenaries and military advisers from the infamous US security firm, formerly known as Blackwater, are replacing UAE troops in the Saudi war in Yemen. The Beirut-based al-Akhbar newspaper said on Thursday UAE forces are being gradually replaced by recruits from the US-based private military contractor, which now goes by the name, Acamedi. The move came after the UAE evacuated some of its military sites in Yemen following its failures in several operations, the Lebanese daily added. According to al-Akhbar, UAE's move to involve the private military contractor in the Yemen conflict has raised objections among some members of the Saudi-led coalition. On Wednesday, Yemen's Arabic-language al-Masirah news website said the commander-in-chief of Blackwater mercenaries in the country (a Mexican national) was killed in the al-Omari district of Ta'izz Province. Some Australian, British and French advisers and commanders, plus half a dozen Colombian soldiers, were reportedly among the dead. The mercenaries are part of the Emirati forces that help Saudi Arabia in its war against the impoverished nation. Blackwater has had to change its name several times due to its ill fame around the world.
The company which went by the alias Xe Services before its current name is one of the most notorious private security firms in the world for killing scores of civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. Yemen has been under military attacks by Saudi Arabia since March 26.
The Saudi strikes were launched to undermine Yemen's Ansarullah movement and bring fugitive former president Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, a staunch ally of Riyadh, back to power.
