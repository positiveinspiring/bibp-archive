Summary
Panel Discussion Featuring:
The uprisings of the Arab Spring, and the
prolonged nature of the internal
conflicts in Libya and
Syria, have once
again sparked debate over the status of international law and the use of
military intervention to enforce human rights.
However, the discourse over humanitarian
intervention has often overlooked the more unsavory aspects of liberal
thought and Western power politics. This panel will explore the fundamental
problems concerning Neo-Liberalism and its connections to the development of
Neo-Orientalist thought.
The panel will begin with,
-
Professor Pitts providing the historical
foundations of liberal thought and its relationship with the
colonialist ventures of Western European nations
-
Professor Bassiouni will then discuss
the development of international law in the post-World War era and
its use as an instrument to advance the strategic goals of great
powers of the Cold War Era
-
Mr. Greenwald will then contextualize
the use of international law and humanitarian intervention to
justify U.S. involvement in foreign countries, especially in the
Middle East, as well as advance U.S. geo-political strategy in the
post-Cold War Era
-
it will conclude with a discussion by
Professor Ramadan on the academic study of Orientalism, the rise of
Neo-Orientalism in conjunction with Neo-Liberalism, and influence of
Neo-Orientalist thought in the formation of Neo-Liberalism and
political policies towards the Middle East and beyond
