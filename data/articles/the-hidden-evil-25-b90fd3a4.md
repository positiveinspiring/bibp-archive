Volume II - Part II
The Psychopathic Influence
Both the financial elite and their servants who maintain this system, appear
to exhibit behavior that is consistent with symptoms associated with a
medical disorder known as psychopathy.(*)
Psychopaths, also called sociopaths, are
categorized as those who exhibit superficial charm and intelligence, and are
absent of delusions or nervousness.
Their traits include:
-
Unreliability
-
Frequent lying
-
Deceitful and manipulative behavior
(either goal-oriented or for the delight of the act itself)
-
Lack of remorse or shame
-
Antisocial behavior
-
Poor judgment and failure to learn by
experience
-
Incapacity for love
-
Poverty of general emotions
-
Loss of insight
-
Unresponsiveness in personal relations
-
A frequent need for excitement
-
An inflated self-worth
-
An ability to rationalize their behavior
-
A need for complete power
-
A need to dominate others
Psychopathy is basically an emotional disorder.
The book, The Psychopath, by James Blair, Karina
Blair, and Derek Mitchell, states, "The crucial aspect of psychopathy is...
the emotional impairment." According to Dr. J. Reid Meloy's book, The
Psychopathic Mind, although psychopaths don't feel emotion in a normal
sense, they do experience boredom, envy, exhilaration, contempt, sadistic
pleasure, anger, and hints of depression.
Generally, those who believe it's caused by environmental factors use the
term sociopath, and believers of the biological theory use the term
psychopath. Psychopathy closely resembles Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD
or APD) or Conduct Disorder (CD) as outlined in the DSM-IV. These disorders
are detected using the Psychopathy Checklist-Revisited (PCL-R), the DSM-IV,
and other diagnostics.
These character types, comprise about 4% of the population and span every
level of society. Psychopaths can be found in every race, culture,
profession and class. Because the term psychopath has been used to describe
APD types and sociopaths, in this chapter I'll use it as a universal label
for these three character types.
Later when I'm explaining how psychopaths always mask themselves when
seeking positions of power, it will help to remember the following: If a
rational person tries to apply their logic while trying to understand the
reason for an objective or act of a psychopath, they will fail. This will be
explained in more detail later. Likewise, when a rational person hears of
the possibility that a massive lie has been told to a population by a
trusted leader, and they attempt to use their logic to determine weather or
not such a lie is possible, they will usually not believe the truth (that
they have fallen for a huge lie).
The reason for this is that although most of us can identify with small
lies, we find it difficult to conclude that such a massive lie is possible.
When I use the term massive lie, I don't just mean a complete falsehood
regarding a major event, but also the scope of its influence (global) and
the amount of people that have fallen for it.
In his book, The Mask of Sanity, Dr. Hervey Cleckley, says that even during
the most "solemn perjuries" they show "no difficulty at all in looking
anyone tranquilly in the eyes." He adds that that they will "lie about any
matter, under any circumstances." He explains that it is difficult to
express how completely straightforward they appear when telling a blatant
lie.
"The great masses of people will more easily fall victims to a big lie than
to a small one."
-Adolph Hitler
"Lying, deceiving, and manipulation are natural talents for psychopaths,"
agreed Dr. Robert Hare, in his book, Without Conscience. "When caught in a
lie or challenged with the truth, they are seldom perplexed or embarrassed -
they simply change their stories or attempt to rework the facts so that they
appear to be consistent with the lie."
Psychopaths are always able to justify their actions, no matter how brutal.
They have, "an ability to rationalize their behavior so that it appears
warranted, reasonable, and justified," says Dr. Cleckley. Dr. Hare added,
"Psychopaths show a stunning lack of concern for the devastating effects
their actions have on others. Often they are completely forthright about the
matter, calmly stating that they have no sense of guilt, [and] are not sorry
for the pain and destruction they have caused," which, says Dr. Hare, "is
associated with a remarkable ability to rationalize their behavior."
Psychopathy is usually untreatable. Most therapists won't work with them
because they often end up damaged in the process. Dr. Hare explained, "Such
counseling would be wasted on psychopaths." Some of them will even reflect
the wishes of the therapist and pretend to be getting better.
In his book, People of The Lie, psychiatrist Dr. Scott Peck had this to say:
"Among themselves therapists will not infrequently refer to a patient's
psychopathology as being 'overwhelming.' We mean this literally. We
literally feel overwhelmed by the labyrinthine mass of lies and twisted
motives... into which we will be drawn if we attempt to work with such
people..."
Wikipedia describes that, "traditional therapeutic approaches actually make
them, if not worse, then far more adept at manipulating others and
concealing their behavior. They are generally considered to be not only
incurable but also untreatable." Basically psychopaths are the way they are
for life. In most legal jurisdictions they are considered sane. So
technically, they're not mentally ill, just different.
Dr. Scott Peck concludes,
"I have learned nothing in twenty years that
would suggest that evil people can be rapidly influenced by any means
other than raw power. They do not respond," he says, "to either gentle
kindness or any form of spiritual persuasion with which I am familiar
with."
Where Are They?
When people hear the word psychopath,
most think of the famous serial killers locked away in prison. However, most
don't end up in prison or mental hospitals. Dr. Cleckley wrote, "The true
difference between them and the psychopaths who continually go to jails or
to psychiatric hospitals is that they keep up a far better and more
consistent outward appearance of being normal."
"This outward appearance," says Dr. Cleckley, is essentially a mask, which,
"may include business or professional careers that continue in a sense
successful, and which are truly successful when measured by financial reward
or by the casual observer's opinion of real accomplishment."
"Many psychopaths never go to prison or any other facility," agreed Dr.
Hare. "They appear to function reasonably well - as lawyers, doctors,
psychiatrists, academics, mercenaries, police officers, cult leaders,
military personnel, business people, writers, artists, entertainers, and so
fourth - without breaking the law." He continued, "Their intelligence,
family background, social skills, and circumstances permit them to construct
a facade of normalcy."
"Corrupt and callous politicians, social or career fast climbers,
authoritarian leaders, abusing and aggressive persons, etc., are among them"
wrote Dr. Renato Sabbatini in his article, The Psychopath's Brain. "A common
characteristic," says Dr. Sabbatini, "is that they engage systematically in
deception and manipulation of others for personal gain. In fact, many
successful and adapted non-violent sociopaths can be found in our society."
Most of these people are not just right in your churches, schools,
charitable organizations, and workplaces, but by their very nature, they are
likely running them. It is a core trait of the psychopath to place
themselves in positions of influence, not for public service, but for power.
"The experience of pleasure is not reciprocal for the psychopath," stated
Dr. Meloy, "it is available only through sadistic channels of power and
control." Achieving power for the sake of having power is the nature of the
psychopath. "They love to have power and control over others," agreed Dr.
Hare.
The need for absolute power over others and the wish to inflict pain for the
enjoyment of watching others suffer, are almost never apparent to the casual
observer. The reason for this is that another core trait of the psychopath
is disguise. So unfortunately, these individuals usually mask themselves as
good-natured people. If they have tremendous wealth, you can bet that
they'll create charitable organizations as part of their mask.
They are well aware that their mental makeup is drastically different from
the majority. They have a sixth sense for detecting and exploiting any
weakness you may have. At a very early age they learn that they can inflict
mental and emotional harm on others with ease. They also learn how to detect
others like themselves out of a crowd of normal people. Beginning in their
childhood, most of them learn to mimic normal emotional reactions in order
to blend in with society.
An article on Dr. Hare's website called, Psychopaths Among Us, by Robert
Hercz, describes how Dr. Hare was contacted by Nicole Kidman, who wanted his
advice on how to play the part of a psychopath for her film, Malice. Dr.
Hare uses the anecdote of a psychopath who had just witnessed an accident
where a mother watched her child get killed by a car. There's blood all over
the place, and the psychopath experiences no emotion, but instead, is trying
to avoid getting blood on her shoes. The psychopath notices the mother's
emotional reaction to the accident and is fascinated. She goes home, looks
in the mirror, and begins to mimic the facial expressions of the mother.
"That's the psychopath," revealed Dr. Hare.
Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, states that, "any emotions which the
primary psychopath exhibits are the fruits of watching and mimicking other
people's emotions." They are adept at, "using their charm and chameleonlike
abilities to cut a wide swath through society and leaving a wake of ruined
lives behind them," Dr. Hare warns.
"More often than not," says Dr. Cleckley, "the typical psychopath will seem
particularly agreeable and make a distinctly positive impression when he is
first encountered. Alert and friendly in his attitude, he is easy to talk
with and seems to have a good many genuine interests. There is nothing at
all odd or queer about him, and in every respect he tends to embody the
concept of a well-adjusted, happy person."
"Psychopaths are often witty and articulate," concurred Dr. Hare. "They can
be amusing and entertaining conversationalists, ready with quick and clever
comeback, and can tell unlikely but convincing stories that cast themselves
in a good light. They can be very effective in presenting themselves well
and are often very likable and charming."
Remember, most of them don't psychically hurt people, so this is about
mental and emotional domination. To accomplish these objectives, they will
use their mask of sanity to place themselves in positions within your
community. These positions may include school boards, charitable
organizations, churches, politics, law enforcement, or any position which
they believe will offer them power over others. These are the places where
most psychopaths end up, not jail.
A Different Species
Some researchers agree that the
traits exhibited by these people produce a division stronger than age, race,
and religion, which places them in a new category of people. In other words,
these people are almost not human as we know it. The word antisocial does
not describe someone who prefers to sit at home rather than attend
gatherings. More accurately it means antihuman. Most people can't bring
themselves to understand the mind-set of a psychopath. Dr. Hare explained,
"Imagining the world as the psychopath experiences it is close to
impossible."
In his book, Political Ponerology: A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted
for Political Purposes, Dr. Andrew M. Lobaczewski wrote, "The pathocratic
world, the world of pathological egotism and terror, is so difficult to
understand for people raised outside the scope of this phenomenon that they
often manifest childlike naivet , even if they have studied psychopathology
and are psychologists by profession."
But, if you can, try to imagine someone who seeks power for no reason other
than to have power, or someone who deceives just to experience the delight
of having done so. Or someone who tortures another person physically or
emotionally for the enjoyment of watching them suffer. Imagine someone doing
these things, and not losing a moment of sleep at night (zero remorse). And
add to all this, the ability to conceal themselves from an extremely naive
public. Psychopaths are essentially aliens that look human. Probably one of
the best skills to learn is how to detect and avoid a psychopath.
"The typical person, of whatever nationality, wants only to enjoy success in
his job, to be able to afford a reasonably high standard of living complete
with leisure and travel," describes Gary Allen. "He wants to provide for his
family in sickness and in health and to give his children a sound education.
His ambition stops there," says Allen. "He has no desire to exercise power
over others, to conquer other lands or peoples, to be king."
He continues, "Since he has no lust for power, it is difficult for him to
imagine that there are others who have [and] who march to a far different
drum." He asks, "Why should we assume there are no such men today with
perverted lusts for power?" In my opinion, we shouldn't because we know that
they do exist, and consist of about 4% of the population during any period.
"And if these men happen to be billionaires," ponders Allen, "is it not
possible that they would use men like Hitler and Lenin as pawns to size
power for themselves?" As I've demonstrated, true history supports this
claim exactly.
Dr. Hare refers to them as "intraspecies predators." "There is a class of
individuals who have been around forever and who are found in every race,
culture, society and walk of life," he says. "If you think about it," he
adds, "you will realize that what is missing in this picture are the very
qualities that allow human beings to live in social harmony." "It is not a
pretty picture," he warns, "and some express doubt that such people exist."
A 2005, report entitled, Antisocial Personality, Sociopathy, and Psychopathy,
by North Carolina Wesleyan College, describes them as, "morally depraved
individuals who represent the 'monsters' in our society. They are
unstoppable and untreatable predators whose violence is planned, purposeful
and emotionless."
In addition to carrying out goal-oriented acts, the psychopath will also
deceive and create chaos for no reason other than the enjoyment of doing so.
"He will," says Dr. Cleckley, "in fact, commit such deeds in the absence of
any apparent goal at all." This critical factor is often the one which
baffles most rational people. When seeking an explanation for the behavior
of a psychopath, they will attempt to apply reason. But, when dealing with a
psychopath, we must understand that psychopathy is the reason.
One day a scorpion and a frog were by a river's edge and both needed to get
across to the other side. The scorpion said to the frog, "Mr. Frog, would
you be so kind as to let me on your back as you swim across this river? I
have important business to conduct on the other side and I cannot swim in
such a strong current." The frog was a little perturbed and so began to
question the scorpion's motives. The frog spoke, "Mr. Scorpion, while I can
appreciate the fact that you have business to conduct on the other side of
this river, please consider what you are saying."
"You are a scorpion. You have a large stinger at the end of your tail. As
soon as I let you on my back you will proceed to sting me which I might add
IS your nature." The scorpion, ready for this, replied, "My dear Mr. Frog,
it is clearly not in my interest to sting you at all! I do need to get to
the other side and I PROMISE that no harm will come to you." Well, this made
a great deal of sense to the frog, so the scorpion crawled on his back to
make the trek across the river.
The frog was making good time getting across when all of a sudden, in the
middle of the river no less, the scorpion began to sting the frog
repeatedly. The frog, shocked at this development, cried, "Why, oh why are
you doing this? You said you needed to get to the other side to conduct your
business!" The scorpion replied casually, "Mr. Frog, you said it yourself. I
am a scorpion. I have a large stinger at the end of my tail. And yes, it is
in my nature to sting you."
Psychopaths in Politics
If this 4% of the population exists at all levels of society at any given
period, is it possible that some would seek top positions of influence? Of
course. Remember, a need for absolute power over others is a core trait of
the psychopath. Goal-oriented deceitfulness, superficial charm, an outward
friendly appearance, and having no remorse, are other traits which will
allow them to achieve their goals. If they are also people of tremendous
wealth, they will definitely use this to further their objectives. And
because deceitfulness is a core psychopathic trait, this will probably be
done by creating a humanitarian front organization.
Evil people are often busy building for themselves various fronts for
disguise and to further their ambitions. Dr. Peck described, "They are
likely to exert themselves more than most in their continuing effort to
obtain and maintain an image of high respectability." So, unlike in the
movies, evil does not reveal itself as the bad guy dressed in black, or the
monster in plain site. Evil will very rarely expose itself to public light.
It must hide. And it almost always hides under the guise of something
righteous.
In fact, rather than hiding in the shadows dressed in black, it disguises
itself in suits, uniforms, and charitable organizations, which allow it to
deceive us into thinking it's our savior. This enables it to cause far
greater damage. "While evil may manifest itself obviously... it rarely does
so," Dr. Peck proclaimed, and added, "those who are evil are masters of
disguise."
Now let's examine the track record of the people who control the planet.
They have created wars for profit and control, which have resulted in the
deaths of millions of people, for which they exhibit no remorse. They've
allowed attacks to occur, created depressions, and overthrown governments to
further their ambitions. They have repeatedly lied about these events using
the media, which they control, and academia, which they also control by
their Tax-exempt Foundations.
These wealthy people masquerade as the saviors of society. They disguise
themselves using public front organizations, which appear to be humanitarian
in nature. They've repeatedly not only lied about major historical events,
but have deliberately created these catastrophes for their own benefit.
Their own publications indicate that they plan to install a global
dictatorship with them in complete control. These people are textbook
psychopaths.(**) They are antihuman!
Compared to regular law-breaking criminals, these people appear to be OK, on
the surface. But as we've learned, lies, deception, and disguise are
standard traits of those who are evil. "[They] come from the very highest
social strata," wrote Allen. "They are immensely wealthy, highly educated
and extremely cultured. Many of them have lifelong reputations for
philanthropy. Nobody enjoys being put in the position of accusing prominent
people of conspiring to enslave their fellow Americans, but the facts are
inescapable."
If you were to research the people throughout history that have committed
atrocities against populations, you would probably find that most were
psychopaths. Although mainstream history books do describe some of these
events, they don't emphasize the pattern which they were part of. This
pattern consists of a steady stream of psychopaths lying, deceiving and
murdering their way to the top, which then resulted in the atrocities. This
re-occurring theme seems to be the norm.
Regarding this, Dr. Lobaczewski said, "We then usually reach the conclusion
that the deed would not have taken place... since the pathological factor
sealed its occurrence or became an indispensable component it its origin.
The hypothesis thus suggests itself that such factors are commonly active in
the genesis of evil." He explained, "Within this interlocking structure, one
kind of evil feeds and opens doors for others regardless of any individual
or doctrinal motivations." Finally, he suggests, "Since pathological factors
are present within the syntheses of most instances of evil, they are also
present in its continuum."
"Because their willfulness is so extraordinary - and always accompanied by a
lust for power - I suspect that the evil are more likely than most to
politically aggrandize themselves," described Dr. Peck. Dr. Sabbatini wrote,
"Under stressing social situations such as in wars, general poverty and
breakdown of the economy, sweeping epidemics or political fighting, etc.,
sociopaths may acquire the status of regional or national leaders and
saviors... When they are in positions of power, they can inflict far more
damage than as individuals."
Professor Marrs commented, "Yet, in public, they impress us as men who are
likeable, intelligent, refined, fair-minded, tolerant, thoughtful, kind, and
gentile men who sincerely care about such matters as the environment, the
plight of the hungry and starving overseas, the jobless, and the
poverty-stricken. Moreover, they often are recognized as leaders in the
legitimate quest for world peace and tranquility." He continued, "Many are
active in church work and charitable organizations. Others give freely to
good causes." Recognizing this facade, he added, "No one would suspect for a
moment what actually goes on in the deep, dark recesses of their diabolical
minds."
Another extremely useful skill to learn is the ability to detect this
pattern of decay in a nation under a pathological influence. Dr.
Lobaczewski's book, Political Ponerology explains this pattern in detail. He
has experienced this process personally while living in Poland under both
Nazi and Communist occupation.(***) Once you realize that psychopaths
control America and the NATO nations, the reason for endless wars and
never-ending turmoil becomes clear. Once you understand the nature of the
psychopath, it makes perfect sense.
When psychopaths rule a society, it will exhibit their traits. Generally it
will be heavily corrupted. But because deception is a primary trait of the
psychopath, it will appear humane. Its traits can be observed from the
highest level of government down to the street level. If you wanted to
witness the madness of a civilization under psychopathic rule, you need not
visit the state capital or a major city, because even the smallest village
will exhibit these traits.
When the controlling faction of a society is evil the sickness permeates
into the lower levels. Immoral attitudes are projected, while moral ones are
ridiculed, and enemies are created. The destructive process ends with a
holocaust, genocide or persecution of some manner. The New World Order is
such a movement.
In November of 1975, Congressman Lawrence P. McDonald stated that the most
important issue of our time is the "drive of the Rockefellers and their
allies to create a one-world government, combining super-capitalism and
Communism under the same tent, all under their control." He warned that this
drive is "international in scope," and "incredibly evil in intent."
Ross wrote, "I don't know about you, but these... activities seriously
concern me, because my children and grandchildren will suffer many times
greater than we do today under the control of these EVIL MONSTERS."
[Emphasis in original] He added, "I have tried to find worse terms for them,
but this is the best that I can think of to describe them."
When a nation or other organization begins this process of evil, psychopaths
and other deviants are attracted to it like a magnet. Like-minded
individuals are installed in key positions of influence. Regarding the
current epidemic, this would include the federal agencies which are
allegedly carrying out these Cointelpro operations and hitting people with
Non-lethal Weapons, as well as the citizen networks which stalk targets in
public.
As already demonstrated, you must capture the streets and a percentage of
the population in order to install a dictatorship. To do this, a portion of
the society is selected to enforce the dictator's rule on the street level.
Historical evidence suggests that this portion usually consists of the core
operational centers of a society, e.g., factories, hospitals, schools, civic
centers, religious organizations, law enforcement, utility companies,
stores, etc.
Dr. Lobaczewski described this in the following way: "The actions of this
phenomenon affect an entire society, starting with the leaders and
infiltrating every village, small town, factory, business, or farm. The
pathological social structure gradually covers the entire country, creating
a 'new class' within the nation. This privileged class of deviants feels
permanently threatened by the 'others.'" The "others" are apparently the
people who have been targeted for persecution.
The Hidden Evil
It's very difficult to describe with
words an event that must be experienced in order to understand. The event
I'm referring to is the observation of the psychopath or psychopathic system
in its true form, after the mask has been removed. It can be described as
something deeply horrific. This is a gut-wrenching experience for a normal
person, and can cause severe trauma, especially if they can't escape it.
"If someone has personally experienced such a nightmarish reality," says Dr.
Lobaczewski, "he considers people who have not progressed in understanding
it within the same time frame to be simply presumptuous, sometimes even
malicious." "This experience," he continues, "[is] unceremoniously rejected
by... [people and] becomes a psychological burden for him, forcing him to
live within a narrow circle of persons whose experiences have been similar."
This encounter with a psychopathic element has been the experience of many
Mobbing and Hidden Evil targets across the planet. McKinney wrote that one
objective of these harassment campaigns is to instill a perverted sense of
loyalty toward the agency responsible for the harassment. This makes perfect
sense when the pathological factor is considered. "Sadistic control is also
an element of perversion," wrote Dr. Meloy, which is an indication of
"psychopathic disturbance."
McKinney also mentioned that these agencies appear to treat their targets as
objects while harassing them. "Psychopaths view people as little more than
objects to be used for their own gratification," explains Dr. Hare. "The
weak and the vulnerable - whom they mock, rather than pity - are favorite
targets." This helps to explain the reports of people being targeted by the
Hidden Evil for no particular reason, other than being decent. A
psychopathic program will target such people.
Just as the creators of this program are masked as humanitarians, the
program itself is masked as beneficial and necessary. Naive individuals who
participate, may not immediately recognize this. But a percentage of those
who control the weapons which torture civilians (it takes a psychopath to do
this), as well as those on the lower levels who follow and harass targets,
are psychopaths. And they're aware of the true nature of this program.
That's why the joined.
"The outer layer closest to the original content is used for the group's
propaganda purposes," says Dr. Lobaczewski. "Average people succumb to the
first layer's suggestive insinuations for a long time before they learn to
understand the second one as well." "Anyone with certain psychological
deviations," He explains "especially if he is wearing the mask of
normality... immediately perceives the second layer to be attractive and
significant; after all, it was built by people like him."
The pathological factor also helps to clarify why people who are, arguably,
more spiritually and morally evolved than the masses, are being identified
and targeted. According to Dr. Lobaczewski, these types of individuals are
the first to be targeted in regimes controlled by psychopaths. Dr. Meloy
explained that the psychopath's "perception of others' pleasures arouses
only envy and greed in themselves." And that they receive, "gratification of
sadistic impulses through intentional infliction of emotional or physical
pain upon others."
"Psychopathic individuals who never enter psychotherapy are paradigms of
this hatred of goodness," says Dr. Meloy. According to Dr. Meloy, although
envy is not consciously felt, it is the driving force for the motivation of
their destructive behavior. He describes this behavior as "manipulative
cycling" which includes a "mocking, [and] controlling attitude" while
attacking their targets.
"The manipulative cycle," explains Dr. Meloy, "both enhances his narcissism
and protects his vulnerability." This cycle is ongoing because the threat to
the inflated self is ever present. He describes this cycle as a purification
process for the psychopath. "The desire to control and degrade the actual
object . . . may be fueled by the sadistic pleasure inherent in the
behavior," he says.
The mocking and controlling behavior exhibited by these federal agencies
against their targets, appears to be part of the manipulative cycling which
Dr. Meloy speaks of. This makes even more sense when we consider Dr.
Lobaczewski's premise, which states that the controlling psychopathic
faction of a society (the financial elite), will recruit lower-level
psychopaths to do their bidding. These lower-level deviants naturally seek
employment in law enforcement, security, the military, politics, or other
positions which they believe will offer them power.
Summary
A small portion of the population have a psychological makeup which is much
different than most.
They are completely aware of their difference.
They also know that most people are not aware of this profound separation.
The difference includes an emotional deficiency, accompanied by a lack of
remorse, which allows them to operate outside of standard moral boundaries.
They are able to conceal this difference to some degree and usually appear
to be generous and friendly.
They consistently engage in antisocial behavior which includes destroying
people's lives, in order to feed their inflated egos. During this process
they frequently enjoy mocking their targets, which they see as weak, or are
envious of. They will inflict pain upon others for no reason other than the
enjoyment of doing so. They span all levels of society. Some authors
consider them to be a different species of humans.
Psychopaths naturally gravitate toward positions of power. Many historical
atrocities were caused by psychopaths. An organization or nation under a
psychopathic influence will become saturated with its sickness. It will
exhibit these destructive traits, from the upper levels, down to the
smallest village.
The Hidden Evil is a psychopathic program which
exists in a society controlled by psychopaths.
