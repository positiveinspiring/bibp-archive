In this premier episode of
The Geopolitical Report with Kurt Nimmo,
we examine Google's Jigsaw,
an emerging technology that will be used on the internet
to counter speech and ideas considered "extremist"
by the Global Elite.
Initially beta tested on radical Islamists,
we demonstrate how Google and its partners
plan to leverage the technology to marginalize
and ultimately eliminate
opposition to the establishment.
