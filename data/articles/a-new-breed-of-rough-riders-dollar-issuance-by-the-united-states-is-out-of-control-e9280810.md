The breakdown of the monetary system will
be chaotic. When inflation commences, it will be highly disruptive. The
damage to fixed-income assets will seem instantaneous. Foreign-exchange
markets will become dysfunctional. The economy will become even more
fragile and unpredictable.
John Hathaway for Bloomberg
The present fiat currency system will end based on the strategy of
Debase, Default and Deny! It is my opinion that it will be replaced by a
system structured on the IMF and BISs Strategic Drawing Rights (SDRs)
partially backed by precious metals. The question to be asked however is
not what will be the replacement for fiat currency, but who will have
ownership of the assets after this war ends? Who will pay the requisite
tribute that goes to the victors?
Gordon T Long
Dollar issuance by the United States is out of
control, leading to an inflation assault on China, the Chinese commerce
minister said in comments reported at the end of October.
Chen Deming, speaking at a trade fair in
southern China, said,
Because the United States issuance of dollars is out
of control and international commodity prices are continuing to rise, China
is being attacked by imported inflation. The uncertainties of this are
causing firms big problems.
Richard Mills writes,
Socio-economic turmoil - lawlessness,
poverty, lack of adequate medical facilities and attention, low to no
employment, low wages, disease, no clean drinking water or water for
irrigation, and shortages of food or unaffordable food can all cause
socio-economic pressure to build in many countries that were once stable
environments for investment.
Mills also writes,
As a general rule, the most successful man
in life is the man who has the best information.
The best information is truthful information,
which is unfortunately not available through
the mainstream press any
longer.
In a rapidly changing world the best most
truthful information becomes even more crucial, for one false step can
present doom to us and our families. It is when we understand what and why
things are happening that we gain the power to avoid catastrophe.
Modern Medicine is a
Sitting Duck
Drs. Bednarz, Crawford, and Wood write,
While the hour is late, it still makes
sense for leaders in medicine, public health, and nursing to speak up
about what our civilization faces and what we can do about it.
We doubt
this will occur, for reasons everyone who has ever worked in an
organization in hopes of advancing their careers understands.
It is possible that a rare leader will step
forward - probably someone at the end of his or her career - and tell
the populace that growth is over and sustainability is here. It will
hurt and the powerful will attempt to cut their losses at the expense of
the less powerful and powerless.
These professionals think its obvious that,
American society is arrantly unsustainable
- ecologically, fiscally, economically, politically, and ethically.
Succinctly, the world is reaching the physical limits to economic
growth.
This means that the entire economic and
financial model of the world is going to change dramatically.
Its going to
be a different world with higher prices and less money and food for the
masses.
There will also be much less money to support a
multi-trillion-dollar health and medical system in the United States.
Contemporary medicine will eventually be chopped
down to a more appropriate size, which means all the
lies and deceit of the
pharmaceutical companies, the FDA, AMA, APA, CDC, WHO, and others will have
to end simply because people will not be able to afford high-cost medicine
or the damages and side affects they instigate.
Incredibly we have Dr. Matthias Rath running a full-page add in the New York
Times shouting out warnings about the Fourth Reich and the attempts of elite
pharmaceutical and petrochemical interests. I have no idea why he is
singling out the Tea Party Movement for obliteration while defending
Obama
and his program.
No matter which way you turn politically in
America, we find the same controlling interests and the takeover has been
accomplished at least in the field of vaccines where we find 90 percent of
humanity already enslaved. But no doubt patriots will sooner or later turn
out for a fight and then it will be every man and family and small group for
themselves.
Big ugly government is having its day and there
are political monsters on the loose and the last thing they want to be known
as is has-beens.
There is no doubt that Dr. Rath has had his
fingers on the pulses of these madmen and we do know where they all came
from.
I dont particularly go for his American
politics but he is realistic with European ones and the European Union and
he is dead on with oil and pharmaceutical terrorism. Dont know why he
leaves out the
bankers and
chemical monoliths though and all their
representatives in the Obama administration.
And if reform/revolution is not going to come
from the grass roots where is it going to come from, Obama?
If anyone
deserves the crown of being an agent for the unspeakable we have one in him. Under his watch they certainly sprayed enough
toxic dispersants over the gulf and now we are even hearing reports of
peoples esophagus melting down.
Betrayal of the American people is what is
being served up with men, women and children replacing turkeys on the silver
platter.
According to Riki Ott, marine toxicologist and Exxon Valdez survivor,
The people that did evacuate [the Gulf] are
glad they did. And for good reason! I am dealing with about 3-4
autopsies right now
I know of people whose esophagus are dissolving,
disintegrating
I know of people with 4.75% of their lung capacity, with
enlarged hearts
All of these people have oil in their bodies.
Multiple C-130s, military and Coast Guard, along
with various types of Evergreen Air aircraft and boats have been used to
carry out the spraying operation in and around the region, so we know this
has all been a corporate-controlled government operation.
The global economic crisis, really having
only just begun, will in years to come spiral into a Great Global Debt
Depression, plunging the entire world into the greatest economic
catastrophe ever known. This will be the ultimate catalyst, the most
pervasive crisis, and most commanding opportunity to implement the
formation of a global government.
In 1998, The Economist ran an article
entitled, 'Get Ready for the Phoenix,' in which it postulated that by
the year 2018, there will be a global currency, which it termed the
'Phoenix.' The mention of a phoenix is not to go unnoticed, as
symbolically, a phoenix dies and from its ashes a new phoenix emerges.
It is the symbol of destruction as a form of
creation; the ultimate incarnation of crisis as an opportunity, writes
Andrew Gavin Marshall.
Marshall continues,
The middle classes will vanish and poverty
will reign supreme, while the rich become immeasurably richer and more
powerful. Naturally, people will rise up, take to the streets, protest,
demonstrate, riot, even rebel and revolt.
As sure as the people will
resist, the state will repress with police, the military, and the
Homeland Security State apparatus of surveillance and control. Make no
mistake: this is the Thirdworldization of the West: the
Post-Industrial Revolution.
Its going to be a hard ride down and the amount
of paper wealth thats going to be lost is stupendous.
No one really knows the future but we can see
the intentions of certain people and groups.
One of the greatest books I
have ever read was called
The Rise of the Phoenix by Christopher Hills but
it certainly was not about the rise of a central currency and one world
government. Each of us has to incorporate the destruction in our spirits,
transforming disturbing energies and experiences into growth and new inner
wisdom.
A new breed of rough riders we will need to be,
tough in spirit and determined to do and be our best for our families and
loved ones.
