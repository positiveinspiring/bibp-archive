# Technocracy and the Rise of the Police State

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_bigbrother191.htm

Technocracy is a totalitarian system of
economic tyranny, run by scientists and
engineers, that is being implemented world
wide.
The
most 'efficient' means of societal control
is not legislative process, it is
authoritarian control.
This
article clearly depicts the radical
transformation of law enforcement.

Any police officer who shoots to
kill is playing with fire.
In that split second of deciding
whether to shoot and where to aim, that officer has appointed
himself judge, jury and executioner over a fellow citizen. And
when an officer fires a killing shot at a fellow citizen not
once or twice but three and four and five times, he is no longer
a guardian of the people but is acting as a paid assassin.
In so
doing, he has short-circuited a legal system that was long ago
established to protect against such abuses by government agents.
These are hard words, I know, but
hard times call for straight talking.
We've been dancing around the issue
of police shootings for too long now, but we're about to crash
headlong into some harsh realities if we don't do something to
ward off disaster.
You'd better get ready.
It's easy to get outraged when
police wrongfully shoot children, old people and unarmed
citizens watering their lawns or
tending to autistic patients.
It's harder to rouse the
public's ire when the people getting shot and killed by police
are suspected of criminal activities or armed with guns and
knives. Yet both scenarios should be equally reprehensible to
anyone who values human life, due process and the rule of law.
For instance, Paul O'Neal was
shot in the back and killed by police as he fled after
allegedly sideswiping a police car during a chase. The
18-year-old was suspected of stealing a car.
Korryn Gaines was shot and killed - and her
5-year-old son was shot - by police
after Gaines resisted arrest for a traffic warrant and allegedly
threatened to shoot police. Police first shot at Gaines and then
opened fire when she reportedly shot back at them.
Loreal Tsingine was
shot and killed by a police officer after she approached him
holding a small pair of medical scissors. The 27-year-old Native
American woman was suspected of shoplifting.
None of these individuals will ever
have the chance to stand trial, be found guilty or serve a
sentence for their alleged crimes because a police officer - in
a split second - had already tried them, found them guilty and
sentenced them to death.
In every one of these scenarios,
-
police could have resorted to less lethal tactics.
-
they could have attempted
to de-escalate and defuse the situation.
-
they could have acted with
reason and calculation instead of reacting with a killer
instinct.
That police instead chose to fatally
resolve these encounters by using their guns on fellow citizens
speaks volumes about what is wrong with policing in America
today, where police officers are being dressed in the trappings
of war, drilled in the deadly art of combat, and trained to look
upon,
"every individual they interact with as an armed threat and
every situation as a deadly force encounter in the making."
Contrast those three fatal police
shootings with a
police intervention that took place in my hometown of
Charlottesville, Virginia.
On. Aug. 1, 2016, police responded
to a call about a possible abduction of a 17-year-old girl.
When
they confronted the 46-year-old "suspect," he reportedly,
"threw
a trash can at them and then charged them with a knife."
When he
shouted at them to "shoot me," they evaded him.
When
they refused to fire their guns, he stabbed himself in the
chest. The officers then tasered the man in order to subdue him.
So what's the difference between the
first three scenarios and the last, apart from the lack of
overly aggressive policing or trigger-happy officers? Ultimately, it comes down to
training and accountability.
It's the difference between police
officers who rank their personal safety above everyone else's
and police officers who understand that their jobs are to serve
and protect. It's the difference between police trained to shoot
to kill and police trained to resolve situations peacefully.
Most of all, it's the difference between police who believe the
law is on their side and police who know that they will be held
to account for their actions under the same law as everyone
else.
Unfortunately, more and more police
are being trained to view themselves as distinct from the
citizenry, to view their authority as superior to the citizenry,
and to view their lives as more precious than those of their
citizen counterparts.
Instead of being taught to see themselves
as mediators and peacemakers whose lethal weapons are to be used
as a last resort, they are being drilled into acting like gunmen
with killer instincts who shoot to kill rather than merely
incapacitate.
We're approaching a breaking point. This policing crisis is far more
immediate and concerning than the government's so-called war on
terror or drugs.
So why isn't more being done to
address it?
As I make clear in the book
Battlefield America - The War on the American People,
there's too much money at stake, for one, and too much power.
Those responsible for this policing
crisis are none other than,
-
the police unions that are helping
police officers evade accountability for wrongdoing
-
the police
academies that are teaching police officers that their lives are
more valuable than the lives of those they serve
-
a corporate
military sector that is making a killing by selling
military-grade weapons, equipment, technology and tactical
training to domestic police agencies
-
a political establishment
that is dependent on campaign support and funding from the
powerful police unions
-
a police state that is transforming
police officers into extensions of the military in order to
extend its reach and power
This is no longer a debate over good
cops and bad cops.
It's a tug-of-war between the
constitutional republic America's founders intended and the
police state we are fast becoming.
As former Seattle police chief Norm
Stamper recognizes, "Policing
is broken. Tragically, it has been broken from the very
beginning of the institution. It has evolved as a paramilitary,
bureaucratic, organizational arrangement that distances police
officers from the communities they've been sworn to protect and
serve.
When we have shooting after shooting after shooting that
most people would define as at least questionable, it's time to
look, not just at a few bad apples, but the barrel. And I'm
convinced that it is the barrel that is rotted.
So how do we fix what's broken, stop
the senseless shootings and bring about lasting reform?
-
For starters, stop with the scare tactics
In much the same way that
American citizens are being cocooned in a climate of
fear - fear of terrorism, fear of extremism, fear of
each other - by a government that knows exactly which
buttons to push in order to gain the public's
cooperation and compliance, police officers are also
being indoctrinated with the psychology of fear.
"That isn't the word
used in law enforcement circles, of course,"
explains law professor Seth Stoughton.
"Vigilant, attentive,
cautious, alert, or observant are the terms that
appear most often in police publications. But make
no mistake, officers don't learn to be vigilant,
attentive, cautious, alert, and observant just
because it's fun.
They do so because they
are afraid.
Fear is ubiquitous in law enforcement
officers
are constantly barraged with the message that that
they should be afraid, that their survival depends
on it."
Writing for the
Harvard Law Review,
Seth Stoughton continues:
From their earliest days
in the academy, would-be officers are told that
their prime objective, the proverbial "first rule of
law enforcement," is to go home at the end of every
shift.
But they are taught that
they live in an intensely hostile world.
A world that is, quite
literally, gunning for them. As early as the first
day of the police academy, the dangers officers face
are depicted in graphic and heart-wrenching
recordings that capture a fallen officer's last
moments.
Death, they are told, is
constantly a single, small misstep away.
Despite the propaganda being
peddled by the government and police unions,
police today experience less on-the-job fatalities
than they ever have historically.
-
Second, level the playing field
Police are no more or less
special than you or me. Their lives are no more valuable
than any other citizen's.
Whether or not they wield a
gun, police officers are public servants like all other
government officials, which means that they work for us.
They answer to us. We are their employers.
While police are entitled to
every protection afforded under the law, the same as any
other citizen,
they should not be afforded any special privileges.
Most Americans, oblivious
about their own rights, aren't even aware that police
officers have their own
Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, which
protects police officers from being subjected to the
kinds of debilitating indignities heaped upon the
average citizen and grants police officers accused of a
crime with special due process rights and privileges not
afforded to the average citizen.
-
Third, require that police officers be
trained in non-lethal tactics
According to the New
York Times, a survey of 281 police agencies found
that the average young officer received 58 hours of
firearms training and 49 hours of defensive tactical
training, but
only eight hours of de-escalation training.
In fact,
"The training regimens
at nearly all of the nation's police academies
continue to emphasize military-style exercises,
including significant hours spent practicing drill,
formation and saluting."
If police officers are
taking classes in how to shoot, maim and kill, shouldn't
they also be required to take part in annual seminars
teaching de-escalation techniques and educating them
about how to respect their fellow citizens'
constitutional rights, especially under the First and
Fourth Amendments?
Congressional
legislation has been introduced to require that
police officers be trained in non-lethal force, go
through crisis intervention training to help them deal
with the mentally ill, and use the lowest level of force
possible when responding to a threat.
Unfortunately, the police
unions are powerful and the politicians are greedy, and
it remains unlikely that any such legislation will be
adopted in a major election year.
-
Fourth, ditch the quasi-military
obsession
Police forces were never
intended to be standing armies.
Yet with police agencies
dressing like the military in camouflage and armor,
training with the military, using military weapons,
riding around in armored vehicles, recruiting military
veterans, and even boasting military titles, one would
be
hard pressed to distinguish between the two.
Still, it's our job to make
sure that we can distinguish between the two, and that
means keeping the police in their place as civilians -
non-military citizens - who are entrusted with
protecting our rights.
-
Fifth,
demilitarize
There are many examples of
countries where police are not armed and dangerous,
and they are no worse off for it.
Indeed, their crime rates
are low and their police officers are trained to view
every citizen as precious. For all of the talk among
politicians about gun violence and the need to enact
legislation to make it more difficult for Americans to
acquire weapons, little is being done to demilitarize
and de-weaponize police.
Indeed, President Obama is
actually
reconsidering
his limited ban on the flow of military gear to police.
The problem is not that police are in any greater danger
than before.
Rather, by dressing as
warriors, they are acting like warriors and increasing
the danger inherent in every police encounter.
-
Sixth, do away with the police warrior
mindset in favor of a guardian approach
As Stoughton explains,
"Counterintuitively, the
warrior mentality
makes policing less safe for
both officers and civilians."
It also creates avoidable
violence by insisting on deference and compliance and,
"increases the risk that
other officers face in other encounters."
The guardian approach,
however,
"prioritizes service
over crime-fighting
it instructs officers that
their interactions with community members must be
more than legally justified, they must also be
empowering, fair, respectful, and considerate.
The guardian mindset
emphasizes communication over commands, cooperation
over compliance, and legitimacy over authority.
And in the use-of-force
context, the Guardian emphasizes patience and
restraint over control, stability over action."
-
Seventh, stop making taxpayers pay for
police abuses
Some communities are trying
to
require police to carry their own professional liability
insurance.
The logic is that if police
had to pay out of pocket for their own wrongdoing, they
might be more cautious and less inclined to shoot first
and ask questions later.
-
Eighth, stop relying on technology to fix
what's wrong with the country
The body cameras haven't
stopped the police shootings, and they won't as long the
cameras can be turned on and off at will while the
footage remains inaccessible to the public.
One North Carolina police
department is even testing out a
pilot machine learning system that "learns to spot
risk factors for unprofessional conduct" and then
recommend that officer for early intervention.
It sounds a lot like a
pre-crime program, only aimed at police officers, which
sends up its own warning signals.
-
Ninth, take a deep breath because change
takes time
As Stoughton warns,
"Earning public trust
will take decades and require rethinking how
officers are trained as well as the legal and
administrative standards used to review police
violence.
It will require changing
the very culture of policing by reaffirming that
policing must be done with a community, not to a
community."
-
Tenth, stop being busybodies and snitches
Overcriminalization has
partially fueled the drive to "police" everything from
kids walking to the playground alone and backyard
chicken coops to front yard vegetable gardens.
But let's start taking some
responsibility for our own communities and stop turning
every minor incident into a reason to call the police.
-
Finally, support due process for
everyone, not just the people in your circle
Remember that you no longer
have to be poor, black or guilty to be treated like a
criminal
in America.
All that is required is that
you belong to the suspect class - a.k.a. the citizenry -
of the American police state. As a de facto
member of this so-called criminal class, every U.S.
citizen is now guilty until proven innocent.
You could be the next person who
gets shot by a police officer for moving the wrong way during a
traffic stop, running the wrong way in the vicinity of a police
officer, or defending yourself against a home invasion when the
police show up at the wrong address in the middle of the
night.
People have been wrongfully shot and
killed for these exact reasons.
So stop judging and start holding
your government officials accountable to ensuring that every
American is granted due process of law, which means that no one
can be deprived of "life, liberty or property" by a government
official without certain fair and legal procedures being
followed.
There can be no justice in America
when Americans are being killed, detained and robbed at gunpoint
by government officials on the mere suspicion of wrongdoing.
Unfortunately, Americans have been
so propagandized, politicized and polarized that many feel
compelled to choose sides between defending the police at all
costs or painting them as dangerously out-of-control. Nothing is
ever that black and white, but there are a few things that we
can be sure of: America is not a battlefield.
American citizens are not enemy
combatants. And police officers - no matter how courageous - are
not soldiers.
Therein lies the problem: we've
allowed the government to create an alternate reality in which
freedom is secondary to security, and the rights of the
citizenry are less important than the authority of the
government. This way lies madness.
The longer we wait to burst the
bubble on this false chimera, the harder it will be to return to
a time when police were public servants and freedom actually
meant something, and the greater the risks to both police
officers and the rest of the citizenry.
Something must be done and soon.
The police state,
-
Wants the us vs.
them dichotomy
-
It wants us to turn each other in, distrust each
other and be at each other's throats, while it continues
amassing power
-
It wants police officers who act like the
military, and citizens who cower in fear
-
It wants a suspect
society
-
It wants us to play by its rules instead of holding it
accountable to the rule of law
The best way to beat the police
state:
don't play by their rules.
Make them play by ours instead...
