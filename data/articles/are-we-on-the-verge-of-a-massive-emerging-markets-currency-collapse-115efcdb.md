This time,
the Federal Reserve
(FED) has created a truly global problem.
A big chunk of the trillions of dollars that it
pumped into the financial system over the past several years has flowed into
emerging markets. But now that the FED has decided to begin "the taper",
investors see it as a sign to pull the "hot money" out of emerging markets
as rapidly as possible.
This is causing currencies to collapse and
interest rates to soar all over the planet.

...are just some of the emerging markets that have been hit hard so
far.
In fact, last week emerging
market currencies experienced the biggest decline that we have seen since
the financial crisis of 2008. And all of this chaos in emerging markets is
seriously spooking Wall Street as well. The Dow has fallen nearly 500 points
over the last two trading sessions alone.
If the Federal Reserve opts to taper even more
in the coming days, this currency crisis could rapidly turn into a complete
and total currency collapse.
A lot of Americans have always assumed that the
U.S. dollar would be the first currency to collapse when the next great
financial crisis happens. But actually, right now just the opposite is
happening and it is causing chaos all over the planet.
For instance, just check out what is happening
in Turkey according to a recent report in
The New York Times...
Turkey's currency fell to a record low
against the dollar on Friday, a drop that will hit the purchasing power
of everyone in the country.
On a street corner in Istanbul, Yilmaz Gok,
51, said, "I'm a retiree making ends meet on a small pension and all I
care about is a possible increase in prices."
"I will need to cut further," he said.
"Maybe I should use my natural gas heater less."
As inflation escalates and interest rates soar
in these countries, ordinary citizens are going to feel the squeeze. Just
having enough money to purchase the basics is going to become more
difficult.
And this is not just limited to a few countries.
What we are watching right now is truly
a global phenomenon...
"You've had a massive selloff in these
emerging-market currencies," Nick Xanders, a London-based equity
strategist at BTIG Ltd., said by telephone.
"Ruble, rupee, real, rand: they've all
fallen and the main cause has been tapering. A lot of companies that
have benefited from emerging-markets growth are now seeing it go the
other way."
So why is this happening?
Well, there are a
number of factors involved of course. However,
as with so many of our other problems, the
actions of the Federal Reserve are at the very heart of this crisis.
A recent USA
Today article described how the FED helped create this massive bubble in
the emerging markets...
Emerging markets are the future growth
engine of the global economy and an important source of profits for U.S.
companies.
These developing economies were both
recipients and beneficiaries of massive cash inflows the past few years
as investors sought out bigger returns fostered by injections of cheap
cash from the Federal Reserve and other central bankers.
But now that the FED has started to dial
back its stimulus, many investors are yanking their cash out of emerging
markets and bringing the cash back to more stable markets and economies,
such as the U.S., hurting the developing nations in the process,
explains Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock.
"Emerging markets need the hot money but
capital is exiting now," says Koesterich. "What you have is people
saying, 'I don't want to own emerging markets.'"
What we are potentially facing is the bursting
of a financial bubble on a global scale.
Just check out what Egon
von Greyerz, the founder of Matterhorn Asset Management in
Switzerland, recently had to say...
If you take the Turkish lira, that plunged
to new lows this week, and the Russian ruble is at the lowest level in 5
years.
In South Africa, the rand is at the weakest
since 2008. The currencies are also weak in Brazil and Mexico. But there
are many other countries whose situation is extremely dire, like India,
Indonesia, Hungary, Poland, the Ukraine, and Venezuela.
I'm mentioning these countries individually
just to stress that this situation is
extremely serious. It is also on a massive scale. In virtually
all of these countries currencies are plunging and so are bonds, which
is leading to much higher interest
rates.
And the cost of credit-default swaps in
these countries is surging due
to the increased credit risks.
And many smaller nations are being deeply
affected already as well.
For example, most Americans cannot even find
Liberia on a map, but right now the actions of our Federal Reserve have
pushed the currency of that small nation to
the verge of collapse...
Liberia's finance minister warned against
panic today after being summoned to parliament to explain a crash in the
value of Liberia's currency against the US dollar.
"Let's be careful about what we say
about the economy. Inflation, ladies and gentlemen, is not out of
control," Amara Konneh told lawmakers, while adding that the
government was "concerned" about the trend.
Closer to home, the Mexican
peso tumbled quite a bit last week and is now beginning to show
significant weakness. If Mexico experiences a currency collapse, that would
be a huge blow to the U.S. economy.
Like I said, this is something that is happening
on a global scale.
If this continues, we will eventually see
looting, violence, blackouts, shortages of basic supplies, and runs on the
banks in emerging markets all over the planet just like we are already
witnessing
in Argentina and Venezuela.
Hopefully something can be done to stop this
from happening.
But once a bubble starts to burst, it is really difficult
to try to hold it together. Meanwhile, I find it to be very "interesting"
that last week we witnessed the largest withdrawal from JPMorgan's gold
vault
ever recorded.
Was someone anticipating something?
Once again, hopefully this crisis will be
contained shortly. But if the FED announces that it has decided to taper
some more, that is going to be a signal to investors that they should race
for the exits and the crisis in the emerging markets will get a whole lot
worse.
And if you listen carefully, global officials
are telling us that is precisely what we should expect.
For example, consider the following statement from
the finance minister of Mexico...
"We expected this
year to be a volatile year for EM as the FED tapers," Mexican Finance
Minister Luis Videgaray said, adding that volatility "will happen
throughout the year as tapering goes on".
Yes indeed - it is looking like this is going to
be a very volatile year.
I hope that you are ready for what is coming
next.
