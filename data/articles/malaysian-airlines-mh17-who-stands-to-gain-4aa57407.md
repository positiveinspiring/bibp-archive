This article is dedicated
to the cherished memory
of all those on MH 17 - especially
the 80 children who were on board.
The Russian military has released military monitoring data which challenge
allegations circulating in the media pertaining to the
MH 17 crash in the Donetsk Region of Eastern Ukraine
on July 17, 2014.
Questions have been raised about Kiev military
jets tracking MH 17 (Malaysia Airlines flight MH-370), Ukrainian air traffic controllers and the deployment of Buk missile systems. Kiev should also release military data on the
circumstances leading to the crash.
So should the Pentagon which reportedly has
relevant intelligence and satellite data.
Since military data is hardcore information, Kiev and Washington should be
persuaded to be transparent and accountable. The UN Secretary-General can
play a role in this since there is a specialized agency within
the
United Nations, the ICAO, dedicated to international civil
aviation. Military data from Moscow, Kiev and Washington should be
scrutinized by the independent international panel that is supposed to probe
the MH 17 catastrophe.
Such data carries much more weight than videos purportedly revealing the
role of the pro-Russian rebels and the Russian government in the crash.
One such video showing a
Buk system being moved from Ukraine to
Russia is a fabrication. The billboard in the background establishes that it
was shot in a town - Krasnoarmeisk - that has been under the control of the
Ukrainian military since May 11.
Similarly, a YouTube video showing a Russian
General and Ukrainian rebels discussing their role in mistakenly downing a
civilian aircraft was, from various tell-tale signs, produced before the
event.
The public should be wary of fabricated "evidence" of this sort, after what
we have witnessed in the last so many years.
Have we forgotten the monstrous lies and massive
distortions that accompanied the reckless allegation that Iraq had weapons
of mass destruction (WMD) which led eventually to the invasion of that
country in 2003 and the death of more than a million people? Iraq continues
to bleed to this day.
What about the
Gulf of Tonkin episode of 1964 which again
was a fabrication that paved the way for wanton U.S. aggression against
Vietnam that resulted in the death of more than 3 million Vietnamese?
The "babies
in incubators" incident in Kuwait in 1990 was yet another
manufactured lie that aroused the anger of the people and served to justify
the U.S. assault on Iraq.
Just last year we saw how an attempt was made by
some parties to pin the blame for a
sarin gas attack in Ghouta, Syria upon the
Assad government when subsequent investigations have revealed that it was
the work of some militant rebel group.
From Tonkin to Ghouta there is a discernible pattern when it comes to the
fabrication of evidence to justify some nefarious agenda or other. As soon
as the event occurs before any proper investigation has begun, blame is
apportioned upon the targeted party.
This is done willfully to divert attention from
the real culprit whose act of evil remains concealed and camouflaged.
The colluding media then begins to spin the
"correct" version with the help of its reporters and columnists who concoct
"fact" out of fiction. Any other explanation or interpretation of the event
is discredited and dismissed derisively to ensure that the "credibility" of
the dominant narrative remains intact. As the narrative unfolds, the target
often embodied in a certain personality is demonized to such a degree that
he arouses the ire of the public and becomes an object of venom.
The pattern described here is typical of what is known as
a
"false flag" operation in which blame for some dastardly deed is
consciously transferred to ones adversary.
It has happened right through history and many
contemporary nation-states - and not just the United States - are guilty of
flying false flags.
To protect ourselves from being deceived by such operations, the general
public should always ask: who stands to gain from a particular episode? Cui
Bono is in fact an important principle in the investigation of a crime.
In the case of the MH 17 carnage, the
pro-Russian rebels do not benefit in any way from downing a civilian
airliner. Their goal is independence from the Kiev government which is why
they are fighting Kiev through sometimes violent means including shooting
down its military planes. Massacring 298 passengers in a flight from
Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur does not serve their cause.
Moscow which backs the rebels to an extent also
gains nothing from involving itself in such a diabolical carnage.
10 days after the carnage, it is now clear who is trying to reap benefits
from that terrible tragedy in the skies. The demonization of the Russian
President, Vladimir Putin, orchestrated from various Western
capitals, including Kiev, after
Crimea voted to join the Russian Federation,
thus thwarting one of the primary strategic goals of NATOs eastward
expansion, has now reached its pinnacle.
After MH 17, it has become a lot easier to
convince people - even without an iota of evidence - that Putin is a "mass
murderer". The tarnishing of Putins image is crucial for those in the West
who want to curb Russias political re-assertion so that the U.S. and its
allies can perpetuate their global dominance without hindrance.
MH 17 has helped the elite in Washington in yet another sense. It has
strengthened its push for tougher sanctions against Russia which began after
the Crimea vote. Given their extensive economic ties with Russia, many
European countries such as Germany, France, Netherlands and Italy have been
somewhat lukewarm about widening and deepening sanctions.
But will that change now? Will an outraged
European public, incensed by the MH 17 massacre, demand that their
governments punish Moscow?
It is obvious that those who seek to punish Russia and the pro-Russian
rebels, namely,
the elite in Washington and Kiev, are
poised to gain the most from the MH 17 episode.
Does it imply that they would have had a role in
the episode itself?
Only a truly independent and impartial
international inquiry would be able to provide the answer.
In this regard, we must admit that while elites in Kiev and Washington may
stand to gain from MH 17, those who actually pulled the trigger may be some
other group or individual with links to the powerful in the two capitals.
It is quite conceivable that a certain
well-heeled individual equipped with the appropriate military apparatus and
with access to air-control authorities in the region may have executed the
act of evil itself.
Because of who he is, and where his loyalties lie, that individual may have
also decided to target Malaysia.
-
Was he giving vent to his anger over our
principled stand on the question of justice for the Palestinians?
-
Was he also attempting to divert public
attention from Israels ground offensive against Gaza which
time-wise coincided with the downing of the Malaysian airliner?
-
As we explore MH 17 from this angle,
would we be able to connect the dots between MH 17 and MH 370,
between July 17 and March 8, 2014?
We should not rest till the whole truth is known
and the evil behind these two colossal catastrophes punished severely.
We owe this to every soul who perished on those fateful flights.
