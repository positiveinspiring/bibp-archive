In October of this year, one month prior to the
November midterm elections, a special army unit known as 'Consequence
Management Response Force' will be ready for deployment on
American soil if so ordered by the President.

The
special force, which is the new name being
given to the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry, has been
training at Fort Stewart, Georgia and is composed of
80,000 troops.
According to the
Army Times,
They may be called upon to help with civil
unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios
such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical,
biological, radiological, nuclear or high-yield explosive, or
CBRNE,
attack.
The key phrase is 'may be called upon to help
with civil unrest.'
This afternoon a local radio talk show host reported that he had been in
contact with a member of the military. This military source stated that the
armed forces have been alerted to the strong possibility that civil unrest
may occur in the United States this summer, prior to the midterm elections
of 2010.
The source described this as 'our long, hot summer of discontent' that could
be eerily reminiscent of the summer of 1968 when riots broke out in many of
our largest cities.
However, the summer of 2010 could well be much worse due to the players
involved. In 1968 the major players were war protesters. This time, the
outrage simmering beneath the surface of American society involves a broad
cross-section of the heartland, and most of them are heavily armed.
It is highly unlikely that these citizens would ever initiate armed conflict
of any kind. In their view, gun rights are for self-defense - and for defense
against tyrannical government, which our Founders regarded as the most
dangerous force on earth.
However, it has become clear that other groups may well initiate violence in
order to start an 'incident' that would give Obama and a rogue Congress a
reason to implement
martial law, confiscate the citizens' guns, enforce
curfews, and suspend all future elections until such time as it is deemed
'safe' to proceed with human liberty as encapsulated in the right to vote.
Tea Party members, for example, have been warned in recent days that members
of Andy Stern's SEIU union and members of the organization formerly known as
ACORN plan to
infiltrate Tea Party gatherings in order to incite
some sort of incident that could result in armed conflict.
In addition, all indications point to a humiliating defeat for the Democrats
and Obama in November. Not only will the House in all likelihood transfer to
Republican control, but it is increasingly possible for the Democrats to
lose the Senate as well.
And there are Leftwing groups in this country that would use whatever means
necessary to prevent that from happening.
ACORN has already gone underground, changing its name so as to fly beneath
the radar screen. How many people will the group register to vote illegally?
And with Obama's plan to naturalize between 10 and 20 million illegal
aliens, a brand new voter base for the Democrats will be in place prior to
November.
Add to this the growing unrest over continued high unemployment, the coming
spike in interest rates and inflation, and the still-boiling outrage over
the manner in which
Obama and the Democrats shoved ObamaCare down the
throats of the citizens, and all of the ingredients are present for a major
F-5 tornado to sweep across the heartland.
To what extent would soldiers use deadly force during such 'civil unrest'
should the Consequence Management Response Team be utilized? During the
anti-war riots of the 1960s they killed student protesters. What about now?
The military source cited by the radio host today was asked this very
question. He would merely say that the culture of the U.S. military is
changing - half support Obama and the other half are dead-set against him.
His conclusion?
There is no way to know for sure if they would
obey an order to open fire on ordinary citizens.
Update
The Cato Institute published this warning
when the program was launched in its first phase in 2008 (the program has
been updated and expanded since 2008).
The Founders insisted that standing armies were
never to be used against American citizens on our own soil, no matter what
violations of this principle have occurred in the years following.
In the
spirit of the Patriots and of real journalists government must be questioned
constantly and held to intense scrutiny in order to preserve liberty.
