Russia Today's "Keiser Report" presenter Max
Keiser kicks the panel he appears on with their support and love for the
world's bankers.
The bankers who are "financial terrorists", and
politicians who backed them, have performed the largest financial crime in
the history of the planet. They have stolen from savers, pensions, and
private sector taxpayers.
When will any of the bankers, or the politicians who aided and abetted the
largest financial crime in the world's history be arrested, charged or
imprisoned?
