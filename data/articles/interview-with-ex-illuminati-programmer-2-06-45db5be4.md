Q: I just find it amazing that this sort of topic (Ritual Abuse, mindcontrol) gets next to no press attention, considering the amount
of evidence available.
A: Here is where I will sound really, really cynical. I'm not
surprised, because the Illuminati leadership often boasted that
their best protection was that no one would believe what was
happening. They also have their own media blitz campaign, one that
is pretty effective. For example, a reporter with the initials M.
S., who wrote articles on Ritual Abuse (RA) and
Mind Control in the
San Diego Union-Tribune, was a member of the Illuminati. His
articles have almost a patent formula.
1. He interviews supposedly respected doctors in the field. These
people with scholarly credentials, the "thinking man's verdict" give
a rational, measured conclusion: no logically thinking being could
ever possibly believe in ritual abuse, and the therapists that treat
victims of it are leading the poor people on, the gullible little
dears being oppressed by therapists of a most vicious and mercenary
bent.
2. He then exposes the "fundamentalist, narrow minded" "raving" and
"mentally ill" people who say that ritual abuse is real, and the
"fraudulent" or supposedly mercenary/attention seeking therapists
that work with them. His word images create the image of a person
practically foaming at the mouth, full of demented ravings, on this
side of the fence. He then brings in the heart break of dear,
precious families broken apart by the wicked therapists who are
"implanting" ideas of ritual abuse in these poor victim's heads.
Wrap up with the supposedly rational, caring, logical and
compassionate person on the FMS board saying how tragic it is that
this is occurring, that something needs to be done.
M.S. never mentions that the therapists who work with ritual abuse
survivors work for very low pay, or sometimes for free, to help
these people break free of the chains of a lifetime. He never ever
interviews the large percentage (>85%) of the psychological field
that has stated that they believe that ritual abuse is, or could be
real; instead, he only interviews the minority viewpoint to feed his
agenda.
Okay, so now we know that the normal media is quite biased at times.
Q: But, with the evidence out there, why aren't more people
concerned about the Illuminati?
A: Because they simply can't, won't believe that this is happening.
I am a strong Christian, and in Revelations, it says that right
before the return of Jesus, people will be acting as if nothing has
happened, that all is normal, in spite of evidence to the contrary.
You could show people a video taken of a ritual, and they would
declare:
"it has to be a fake; people just don't do those things."
You can show them a site with pentagrams, buried bones, and other
evidence, and they would say, "Oh, that is just teenagers playing
around". You can show them photos of underground tunnels near Los
Alamos, and they will say, "Isn't that interesting. Must be some
government project." They can be shown the scars on a survivor's
body, from cigarette burns in childhood, and old lash marks that
have healed on their back, and the question would be "are you sure
it wasn't self inflicted?"
The evidence is there, but in my opinion,
the average person does
NOT want to know, and even when confronted with it, will look the
other way.
The Franklin case is a point. How much evidence has come out? Or the
MK-Ultra documents that have been declassified, shown as real, and
people ignore it.
Okay, I'll get off my soap box. But I believe that the media that
downplays ritual abuse is feeding into a deep need in the average
person to NOT know the reality. In fact, how can a person face the
fact of great evil in mankind, unless they have either a strong
faith in God, or are faced with insurmountable evidence? We as human
beings want to believe the BEST of our race, not the worst, IMHO.
Q: You probably have heard of the 'Bohemian Grove'. What do you know
about this? Any connection to the Illuminati?
A: I myself do not know anything about the Bohemian Grove. Remember,
I wouldn't have been in a position to have much to do with it. Most
of my connections were with Germany. I was never prostituted out,
instead I taught others to be that. But I myself never went there,
and really don't know anything about it. I'm sorry I can't be more
helpful there.
Now, if you were asking about the masonic temple in Alexandria, Va.,
or the "Institute" in Charlottesville, Va., or a small grove up in
Canada with a bronze statue of Baal, I could help you. Sorry I don't
have anything to share on this topic. If the Bohemian Grove is
occult, though, it probably definitely is known about by the
Illuminati.
