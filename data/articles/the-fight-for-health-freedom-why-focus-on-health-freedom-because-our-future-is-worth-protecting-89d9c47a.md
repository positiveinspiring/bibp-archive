# The Fight For Health Freedom - Why Focus on Health Freedom? Because Our 
Future is Worth Protecting

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_bigbrother41.htm

We've been covering health freedom
topics with great intensity lately, and that has taken away from
our typical coverage of natural cures, herbal remedies,
medicinal foods and so on.
Some people are asking why we've
shifted our focus, and I want to answer those questions with
clarity and determination.
It's one thing to know HOW to use herbs and superfoods, and
there's a wealth of knowledge to be gained in that area. But
it's another thing entirely to have ACCESS to those herbs and
superfoods without being criminalized or harassed by the
government in the process. I would say that unless you have
access to those healing remedies, all the knowledge in the world
of how to use them makes no difference.
Our access to natural healing remedies, superfoods and herbs is
under constant threat.
For example,
the FDA has outlawed
supplement companies and food companies from offering
scientifically-validated free speech about their products.
If a cherry company links to a
scientific study on its website, providing a scientific basis
for clinical evidence that cherries can help prevent gout, for
example, the FDA sends them a threatening letter claiming they
may be subjected to criminal prosecution, have their products
seized, and even thrown in prison for selling "unapproved
drugs."
Both local and federal authorities, meanwhile, have declared war
on raw milk producers, treating them like drug dealers with
armed raids, arrests and criminal prosecutions. If milking a cow
and selling that milk to your neighbor is now a federal crime,
what other foods or natural substances might the feds go after
next? (It looks like they may soon outlaw the selling of breast
milk!)
With the passage of the recent
Food Safety Modernization Act,
the FDA will be moving forward with so-called Codex Alimentarius
harmonization. It's
written right into the
bill text.
This law also requires the FDA to
set up enforcement offices in foreign nations to run a global
food safety scheme that will try to pasteurize, irradiate or
fumigate virtually all foods entering the United States. This is
an effort to kill these foods and destroy most of their
nutritive qualities.
"Safety" is just the excuse to
sterilize your food.
This same law also gives the FDA authority to inspect and shut
down backyard gardeners, small local farmers, small greenhouse
operations, people who sell items at the farmers' market, and so
on.
No, these groups are not automatically exempt from the bill
as was claimed by bill proponents:
They must "apply" to be
granted exemption by the FDA - a process requiring them to
produce tax returns, safety documentation and a pile of
paperwork that the FDA can choose to declare "insufficient."
With our health freedoms under attack, it's crucial that we take
a stand and support our Natural Law rights (God-given rights) to
grow our own food and medicine, to buy food and natural
medicine, and to sell what we grow to our local neighbors and
community members.
All these rights are under assault
by the federal government, and if we don't work to oppose the
tyrants who want to take away our access to healing foods, herbs
and supplements, we may end up living in a nation where vitamins
are outlawed (or at least the natural, food-based vitamins are),
herbs are regulated off the shelves and local farmers' markets
are shut down.
Instead of getting your food from a neighbor, you'll have to get
it from a food factory that passes the FDA's "safety"
inspections even though it's still injecting aspartame, sodium
nitrite and MSG into its food products. (The FDA considers all
those chemical food additives to be "safe," believe it or not.)
Why protecting our freedoms is
crucial to our health
If we do nothing and stay silent, it is guaranteed that our
access to natural remedies and honest food will be stolen from
us by tyrannical bureaucrats who incessantly work to protect the
financial interests of
Big Pharma and the sick-care
industry.
They don't necessarily want you to
be well. They don't want you to buy local food. What they want
is to turn consumers into cattle, where they feed you dead,
processed foods and then make a fortune off the degenerative
disease that inevitably develops as a result.
And they especially want you to do what you're told and stop
questioning vaccines. Stop questioning the chemicals in the
food. Just eat it, swallow and buy into it.
What I seek to do, on the other hand, is protect our food
freedoms by alerting you when those freedoms are under attack.
I aim to expose the true agenda of
the FDA and Big Government tyrants who are trying to take away
your raw milk, take away your access to nutritional supplements
and censor the truth about how natural remedies can prevent and
even cure serious disease.
Health freedom protection is a team
effort
In addition to NaturalNews, other health freedom organizations
are also part of the leading edge of this fight:
Authors such as Naomi Wolf, Lew
Rockwell, Ed Griffin, Dr Gary North and many others are beating
the freedom drum on other fronts that are just as important (the
FED, the
police state, etc.).
We are, collectively, your early warning system. We are alerting
you to the very real threats that are headed your way, and we're
trying to prevent the tyrants from taking over.
-
The TSA is now shoving their
hands down your pants at the airports (who would have
even imagined that a decade ago?).
-
The FDA is threatening
walnut company founders with prison time for telling the
truth about the health benefits of walnuts.
-
The DEA is ignoring state
law and raiding medicinal marijuana dispensaries that
are 100% compliant with state and local laws.
-
The FED is giving away
trillions of dollars to foreign corporations.
-
The President is granting
health care waivers to McDonald's and hundreds of other
corporations that will be exempted from Obamacare
regulations.
-
The CDC keeps pushing
flu vaccine propaganda
based on junk science while avoiding any mention of
vitamin D.
Need I go on?
One by one, nearly every government
agency is on a power trip, seeking to expand its power at the
expense of your freedom. The tyrants are running loose in
America, and if we don't reverse this dangerous trend, there is
absolutely no question where we will end up because history
teaches this lesson well:
A police state nation run by the
wealthy elite corporatists who dictate government policy and
centralize power into their own hands (while stealing it out
of yours).
They want power over everything you
do:
What you
eat, what you buy, how you
save your
money (did you notice U.S.
banks don't let you save money in foreign currencies?), what
you think (TV programming),
what you read (don't read
Wikileaks or you'll never
get a government job!) and even how you live and die (sick-care
monopoly).
The government does not want you to
have free choice over your body, your mind, your finances or
your future. They want to control your choices while giving you
the illusion of choice. Sure, go out a vote every two years and
see if it really makes any difference. The
corporations already run Congress.
Whether you vote Republican or
Democrat,
they still call the shots at the top.
Can't we just meditate our way out
of this?
There are quite a number of "create
your own reality" people who believe we can all just
meditate our way out of this.
The thinking goes like this:
Since we create our own reality,
we can just sit in our rooms and imagine the world being a
better place, and it will come true.
I'm not trying to make fun of this
position.
There is merit to it, but as much as
I value meditation, positive thinking and even to some extent
the Law of Attraction, it is a mistranslation of those
principles to think that we do not have to take a stand in the
real world, from time to time, against those who would steal our
freedoms from us.
What would have happened in India if Gandhi just sat
around and meditated instead of leading his people on his famous
resistance march to gather salt? That the British Empire
outlawed salt in India and forbade is people from harvesting it
is very much the same as the U.S. government outlawing raw milk
or dictating the operations of small family farms.
We are experiencing an historical
rise of tyranny in America, and we must rise up against it or be
overrun by it.
What would have happened in colonial America of Paul Revere,
instead of riding his horse to warn his neighbors that the
British were coming, just sat in his living room and tried to
think positive thoughts instead? Quite possibly, Americans might
still be British subjects today.
If you want proof of what happens when you sit around and
meditate instead of taking a real-world stand against oppression
and tyranny, just look at the Tibetan Buddhists. You won't find
a more peaceful, dedicated group of wise meditators anywhere on
the planet.
I've visited Buddhist temples on
high mountaintops in Asia. I've spent time with these people
face to face, and I have incredible admiration for them. I've
read many books written by the
Dalai Lama and have
incorporated several Buddhists principles into my own life.
But even I cannot deny the fact that
the Chinese government rolled right over them throughout
mainland China, destroying their temples, arresting their
priests and sending their congregation members into the gulag.
The Dalai Lama lives in exile! And why? Because the Chinese
government stampeded over them. Meditation doesn't stop bullets.
And when evil is running rampant across our lands, evil must be
met with force... and then stopped cold.
I'm not faulting the Buddhists for choosing meditation over
armed resistance. It is a legitimate spiritual decision to avoid
violence and refuse to take part in any resistance movement, but
once you choose that path, the outcome is never in doubt:
Big Government will roll right
over you because governments incessantly desire more power,
and they will always seek to secure more power at any cost.
Even if it means eradicating an
entire religion.
Real action is needed to preserve
liberty
So for those who believe they can sit in candle-lit rooms and
meditate our way out of tyranny, I thank you for your positive
vibes, but I will not limit my own actions to such passivism.
I know from my time in this world,
having lived in numerous countries and spoken different
languages around the world, that those who retain freedom are
those who actively defend it. Eternal vigilance, as Jefferson
said, is the price of freedom.
My goal with NaturalNews is to be eternally vigilant; to help
protect your food freedoms, your access to natural healing herbs
and supplements, and to secure your natural law rights to grow
your own food (and medicine) and sell it to your neighbors if
you so choose.
Your right to grow food and to
engage in free commerce of your food is a "natural law" that
exists as an even higher authority than the Constitution itself.
It is a law of God and nature. You are born with it. No
bureaucrat, no tyrant and no government can take it away from
you (but they will try).
I believe in Liberty, I believe in America's founding
principles, and I believe in the Bill of Rights. And I will
fight to defend it. Nowhere in the world is there another
country that is more free than America once was. This freedom is
worth fighting for.
I was not so adamant about this point until recently, when Big
Government began reaching down our pants at the airport and the
S.510 food safety bill passed.
Today, I cannot stand by idly and do
nothing while our food freedoms are threatened. Codex
harmonization is on the horizon. The
Department of Homeland
Security has us all spying on each other at Wal-Mart. The GMO
conspiracy is very real and very powerful, and they want us all
to eat their poisonous corn and soy products so that we become
diseased and infertile.
I will resist this effort with every ounce of breath in my body.
I will continue to work to expose the dangers of
vaccines,
GMOs,
fluoride,
MSG and
other chemicals, and I will do my best to
promote the
healing properties of natural foods, healing herbs, superfoods and nutritional supplements.
By the way, I haven't made this publicly known until now, but I
was offered a very large sum of money to walk away from NaturalNews and sell it to a multinational corporation. I turned
that down without hesitation. This has never been about money or
profit.
I still don't get paid any salary
for being the editor of NaturalNews. I don't earn any royalties
on the products we sell through our store - every dollar goes
back into NaturalNews to expand our content, build our content
base and attract new readers who also want to know the truth.
We continue to grow our reach and expand our audience by the
day! Our video site is exploding in popularity (www.Naturalnews.TV),
our news site reaches millions of readers each month, and we
have a lineup of video mini-documentaries coming in 2011 that
will absolutely blow your mind.
Along with people like Jesse Ventura, Alex Jones, Jonathan Emord
and James Turner (and many others), we are winning the fight
against tyranny.
We are Journalism 2.0 - it's the new journalism
where you can't buy us off, you can't control our message, and
you can't stop us because we are powered by the People who
support our efforts, who believe in our mission and who
absolutely will not stop until they are free.
That's why I do what I do. That's why I work 16 hour days and
spend nearly every waking hour thinking of new ways to spread
knowledge, enlightenment and a message of FREEDOM for our
collective future.
And that's why I've been writing
about health freedom rather than the specific properties of
medicinal herbs and nutrients. It is crucial that we protect our
natural rights to food and natural medicine, even it is means
putting other projects to the side for the moment.
I thank you for your ongoing support in this mission. Our future
is, in every way, worth fighting for.
And with your help, we can make sure
that future is one based on freedom rather than tyranny.
