Do you know what happened, just 1 DAY BEFORE 911 WTC attacks...! Only one
day before...!
Donald Rumsfeld announced that 2.3 Trillion Dollars Missing on the
date of September 10, 2001, that is ONE DAY BEFORE THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
attacks... TRILLION DOLLARS !!
And the NEXT day 911 WTC and Pentagon bombing attacks happened... VERY
SUSPICIOUS!!! USA is a BOILING KETTLE!
Maybe USA military learned that Donald Rumsfeld was going to announce this
lost Trillion dollars case and ORDERED suicide operation... It means an
operation which is kept secret and ready to use for later, in case of an
emergency... Why? They create chaos in order to change the agenda...
Maybe U.S. military is the guerilla of USA and the world... Who knows? Maybe
true... Always keep this critical info in your mind... and don't forget the
money they collect from Americans via taxes... 2.3 Trillion Dollars!
USA is a country where their president can get killed in front of public...
and they couldn't find who is behind...
Why? Because an inside job never gets
revealed... just stays as conspiracy...
The War On Waste
Defense Department Cannot Account For 25% Of Funds -
$2.3 Trillion
January 29, 2002
LOS ANGELES
from
CBSNews Website
(CBS)
On Sept. 10, Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld declared war. Not on foreign terrorists, "the adversary's
closer to home. It's the Pentagon bureaucracy," he said.
He said money wasted by the military poses a serious threat.
"In fact, it could be said it's a matter of
life and death," he said.
Rumsfeld promised change but the next day -
Sept. 11 - the world changed and in the rush to fund the war on terrorism,
the war on waste seems to have been forgotten.
Just last week President
Bush announced,
"my 2003 budget calls for more than $48
billion in new defense spending."
More money for the Pentagon, CBS News
Correspondent Vince Gonzales reports, while its own auditors admit the
military cannot account for 25 percent of what it spends.
"According to some estimates we cannot track
$2.3 trillion in transactions," Rumsfeld admitted.
$2.3 trillion that's $8,000 for every man,
woman and child in America. To understand how the Pentagon can lose track of
trillions, consider the case of one military accountant who tried to find
out what happened to a mere $300 million.
"We know it's gone. But we don't know what
they spent it on," said Jim Minnery, Defense Finance and Accounting
Service.
Minnery, a former Marine turned whistle-blower,
is risking his job by speaking out for the first time about the millions he
noticed were missing from one defense agency's balance sheets.
Minnery tried to follow the money trail, even
crisscrossing the country looking for records.
"The director looked at me and said 'Why do
you care about this stuff?' It took me aback, you know? My supervisor
asking me why I care about doing a good job," said Minnery.
He was reassigned and says officials then
covered up the problem by just writing it off.
"They have to cover it up," he said. "That's
where the corruption comes in. They have to cover up the fact that they
can't do the job."
The Pentagon's Inspector General "partially
substantiated" several of Minnery's allegations but could not prove
officials tried "to manipulate the financial statements."
Twenty years ago, Department of Defense Analyst Franklin C. Spinney
made headlines exposing what he calls the "accounting games."
He's still there, and although he does not speak
for the Pentagon, he believes the problem has gotten worse.
"Those numbers are pie in the sky. The books
are cooked routinely year after year," he said.
Another critic of Pentagon waste, Retired Vice
Admiral Jack Shanahan, commanded the Navy's 2nd Fleet the first time
Donald Rumsfeld served as Defense Secretary, in 1976.
In his opinion,
"With good financial oversight we could find
$48 billion in loose change in that building, without having to hit the
taxpayers."
