Strauss-Kahn was scheduled to fly from New York, into Paris, and soon meet
with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to force through another mega bailout
of the trans-atlantic system.
What happened? He never made it to Angela
Merkel. In fact, he didn't even get the chance to board the plane before New
York police officers stopped IMF head Strauss-Kahn, and jailed him for
attempted rape.
This was no accident.
The choice for certain political layers was
either the bailout goes through uninterrupted, or it be shut down. In favor
of the latter, Strauss-Kahn was thrown into the jug.
