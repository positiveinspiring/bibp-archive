The House has held a closed session for the first time in 25 years and apparently discussed a hotly contested surveillance bill. Republicans had requested privacy for what they termed "an honest debate" on the new Democratic eavesdropping measure. Conspiracy theorists around the world have filled many pages of blogs and emails with theories as to why the public was prevented to hear what their elected representatives said and heard. That is the nature of secrets: those "kept in the dark" want to know and in the absence of knowledge, seek answers. Writers suggested that the special closed session of the U.S. House of Representatives discussed a lot more than the pending security surveillance provisions. Last week's session was only the fourth time in 176 years that Congress has closed it's doors to the public. Word has begun leaking from last weeks special, closed-door session of the United States House of Representatives. Theorists wrote,
"Not only did members discuss new surveillance provisions as was the publicly stated reason for the closed door session, they also discussed: The imminent collapse of the U.S. economy to occur by September 2008, the imminent collapse of US federal government finances by February 2009, the possibility of Civil War inside the USA as a result of the collapse and advance round-ups of "insurgent U.S. citizens" likely to move against the government. Also theorized was the detention of those rounded-up at "REX 84" camps constructed throughout the USA and the possibility of retaliation against members of Congress for the collapses and the location of "safe facilities" for members of Congress and their families to reside during expected massive civil unrestOther answers included "the necessary and unavoidable merger of the United States with Canada" (for its natural resources) and with Mexico (for its cheap labor pool), the issuance of a new currency - THE AMERO - for all three nations as the proposed solution to the coming economic Armageddon."

Members of Congress were FORBIDDEN to reveal what was discussed and ABC News via WCPO web site (below report), CONFIRMS congress members were FORBIDDEN to talk about it! Several are so furious and concerned about the future of the country, they have begun leaking info. More details coming later today and over the weekend. That is the problem with secrets and inadequate explanations for their necessity, imaginations run wild.
House Goes Behind Closed Doors To Debate Surveillance Bill by Neil Relyea Last Update March 14, 2008
from WCPO Website CAPITOL HILL (AP)
The House has held a closed session for the first time in 25 years, discussing a hotly contested surveillance bill. Republicans had requested privacy for what they termed "an honest debate" on the new Democratic eavesdropping measure. The bill is opposed by the White House and most Republicans in Congress. Lawmakers were forbidden to disclose what was said during the hour-long late-night session. The extent to which minds were changed, if at all, should be more clear Friday, when the House is expected to openly debate and then vote on the bill. President Bush has vowed to veto the surveillance measure, saying it would undermine the nation's security. Bush opposes it in part because it wouldn't provide retroactive legal immunity for telecom companies that may have helped the government eavesdrop on their customers without court permission after the 9/11 terror attacks.

Reunión secreta del Congreso de EE.UU. Jueves 13 de marzo de 2.008
del Sitio Web Dragon68 La sesión de anoche fue solamente la única cuarta vez en 176 años que el Congreso cerró sus puertas al público. Se ha comenzado a filtrar información de la reunión especial de anoche, la sesión a puerta cerrada de la Cámara de Representantes de los Estados Unidos. No sólo hablaron los miembros de nuevas disposiciones de vigilancia, como se declaró públicamente del motivo para la sesión a puerta cerrada, sino que ellos también discutieron otros temas:
El desplome inminente de la economía de EE.UU. que se producirá antes de septiembre de 2.008 El hundimiento inminente de las finanzas gubernamentales de la Reserva Federal antes de febrero 2.009. La posibilidad de una guerra civil dentro de EE.UU. como consecuencia del desplome. Las redadas anticipadas de insurgentes de EE.UU. que se puedan mover probablemente en contra del Gobierno. La detención de los arrestados en las redadas en los campos de concentración "REX 84" (FEMA) construidos en todo EE.UU. La posibilidad de represalias contra de los miembros del Congreso por los desplomes. La ubicación de "servicios de seguridad" para que residan los miembros del Congreso y sus familias durante los disturbios civiles esperados. La necesaria e inevitable fusión de EE.UU. con Canadá (por sus recursos naturales) y con México (por su mano de obra barata). La emisión de una nueva moneda -el Amero- para las tres naciones, como solución propuesta para el próximo Armagedón económico.

Se prohibió a los miembros del Congreso que revelaran lo que se discutió. Varios de ellos están tan furiosos y preocupados por el futuro del país, que han iniciado fugas de información.
