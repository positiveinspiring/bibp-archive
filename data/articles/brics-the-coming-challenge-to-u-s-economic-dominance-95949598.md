Late
last month, leaders from,
-
Brazil
-
Russia
-
India
-
China
-
South Africa,
...the so-called BRICS, announced they were
forming their own development bank to assist other emerging economies.
The yet-to-be-named bank is expected to
compete with the World Bank and the International Monetary fund, two
institutions with power structures based firmly in the United States and
Europe.
The announcement also serves as yet another sign that
the world economy is quickly evolving to a place where United States
global economic dominance is being challenged by regional interests.
Since the end of World War II, the United States was
the driver of global monetary policy. When
the Federal Reserve acted, the world listened and reacted.
Now, according to officials from the BRICS nations,
emerging countries are trying to insulate themselves from the market
shocks caused by the United States and Europe.
They no longer trust the West to do the right
thing.
Theyre forming their own union to create stability
that
the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
and the Fed have been unable to provide.
If there were shocks to the
global financial market, with credit running short, we'd have credit
from our biggest international partner[s], so there would be no
interruption of trade,"
Brazilian
economic minister Guido Mantega said.
The bank, which is planning to raise $50 billion in
capital, is expected to open next year, according to Indian finance
minister P. Chidambaram.
Other alliances around the world are also forming,
portending the end of Western economic dominance.
Leaders from
the BRICS group of emerging powers highlighted the
importance of South-South trade and investment on
Wednesday (March 27, 2013)
as a means of
challenging Western supremacy.
To be clear, these alliances are not monetary unions.
They dont share a currency and therefore do not
share fiscal policy. Yet they do share the common belief that together,
their developing economies can foster and sustain growth.
These alliances do more than simply hedge against
Western financial calamities. They encourage investors to keep money in
the region instead of sending it to western markets and promote trade
between member nations.
Even though many of these alliances lack real teeth,
their formation is important symbolically.
They give emerging economies a forum to show their
strength, as well as send a clear signal that in the future, the United
States is not the only game in town.
Rise of the BRICS
It did not take long for the BRICS to
become a major force on world markets.
The leaders of these countries first met in 2006, but
a formal alliance wasnt made until 2009. South Africa joined the group
in 2010.
These countries now represent more than 3 billion
people. They have a combined gross domestic product of $14.8 trillion,
and hold $4 billion in foreign reserves.
The U.S. economy is still the worlds largest,
although experts agree that the Chinese economy will grow larger by
2016.
And while BRICS economic growth has slowed in recent
years, they weathered the global economic slowdown far better than the
United States and Europe.
In fact, the new BRICS bank is likely the direct
result of the Western response to the crisis. The Fed, the European
Central Bank, the World Bank and the IMF all acted repeatedly to soften
the blow of the crisis.
Yet strong growth, both here and in Europe, remains
elusive.
According to a paper (The
Financial Crisis - Impact on BRIC and Policy Response) by
Ritwik Banerjee and Pankaj Vashisht, published at the height
of the financial crisis, the ability of the BRICS to sustain growth
while Western economies were contracting convinced the emerging nations
that a rebalancing of global economic power was necessary.
The erstwhile engine of global growth, the USA,
was weakening and the new growth poles were emerging, they wrote.
BRICS were one of [the] emerging growth poles that caught the
imagination of the world.
BRICS Not Alone
In the wake of the global financial
crisis, other countries are seeking alliances that will make them less
reliant on the West.
During the financial crisis, Japan, China and South
Korea created a $120 billion emergency loan fund to shore up
Asian nations finances. The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, comprised of 10 countries from that part of the world, is
also experiencing a
period of robust growth.
New partnerships are also emerging closer to home.
√Ålvaro Uribe, former president of Colombia,
recently told The Fiscal Times that his country is considering entering
into a formal economic alliance with Mexico, Peru and Chile, creating a
bloc with a GDP of $2.2 trillion.
These countries have already agreed to eliminate
trade tariffs on 90 percent of the
goods exchanged between them.
But the biggest challenge to U.S. dominance remains
in Asia.
The Pentagon is shifting its strategy to confront
potential rivals in that part of the world. And U.S. companies are
gaining ground in huge consumer markets in China, Indonesia and
Malaysia.
Even the National Basketball Association
recognizes that the key to future success is breaking the Asian market.
It has spent $1.5 billion on a sports and
entertainment
complex outside of Beijing, and has sent
Chinese-American star Jeremy Lin on a tour of the country.
"We are at a critical juncture in human history,
which could lead to widely contrasting futures," Christopher Kojm,
National Intelligence Council chair wrote in a
recent intelligence appraisal.
"By 2030, Asia will be well on its way to
returning to being the world's powerhouse, just as it was before
1500."
