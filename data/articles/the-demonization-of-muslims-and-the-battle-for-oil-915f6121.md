Throughout history, "wars of religion" have
served to obscure the economic and strategic interests behind the conquest
and invasion of foreign lands. "Wars
of religion" were invariably fought with a view to securing
control over trading routes and natural resources.
The Crusades extending from the 11th to the 14th
Century are often presented by historians as,
"a continuous series of military-religious
expeditions made by European Christians in the hope of wresting the Holy
Land from the infidel Turks."
The objective of the Crusades, however, had
little to do with religion. The Crusades largely consisted, through military
action, in challenging the dominion of the Muslim merchant societies, which
controlled the Eastern trade routes.
The "Just War" supported the Crusades.
War was waged with the support of
the
Catholic Church, acting as an instrument of religious propaganda
and indoctrination, which was used in the enlistment throughout Europe of
thousands of peasants, serfs and urban vagabonds.
America's Crusade in
Central Asia and the Middle East
In the eyes of public opinion, possessing a "just cause" for waging war is
central. A war is said to be Just if it is waged on moral, religious or
ethical grounds.
America's Crusade in Central Asia and the Middle East is no exception. The "war
on terrorism" purports to defend the American Homeland and
protect the "civilized world".
It is upheld as a "war of religion", a "clash of
civilizations", when in fact the main objective of this war is to secure
control and corporate ownership over the region's extensive oil wealth,
while also imposing under the helm of the IMF and the World Bank (now under
the leadership of Paul Wolfowitz), the privatization of State enterprises
and the transfer of the countries' economic assets into the hands of foreign
capital. .
The Just War theory upholds war as a "humanitarian operation". It serves to
camouflage the real objectives of the military operation, while providing a
moral and principled image to the invaders. In its contemporary version, it
calls for military intervention on ethical and moral grounds against "rogue
states" and "Islamic terrorists", which are threatening the Homeland.
Possessing a "just cause" for waging war is central to the Bush
administration's justification for invading and occupying both Afghanistan
and Iraq.
Taught in US military academies, a modern-day version of the "Just War"
theory has been embodied into US military doctrine. The "war on terrorism"
and the notion of "preemption" are predicated on the right to "self
defense." They define "when it is permissible to wage war": jus ad bellum.
Jus ad bellum serves to build a consensus within the Armed Forces command
structures. It also serves to convince the troops that the enemy is "evil"
and that they are fighting for a "just cause".
More generally, the Just War theory in
its modern day version is an integral part of war propaganda and media
disinformation, applied to gain public support for a war agenda.
The Battle for Oil -
Demonization of the Enemy
War builds a humanitarian agenda. Throughout history, vilification of the
enemy has been applied time and again.
The Crusades consisted in demonizing the
Turks as infidels and heretics, with a view to justifying
military action.
Demonization serves geopolitical and economic objectives. Likewise, the
campaign against "Islamic terrorism" (which is supported covertly by US
intelligence) supports the conquest of oil wealth. The term "Islamo-fascism,"
serves to degrade the policies, institutions, values and social fabric of
Muslim countries, while also upholding the tenets of "Western democracy" and
the "free market" as the only alternative for these countries.
The US led war in the broader Middle East Central Asian region consists in
gaining control over more than sixty percent of the world's reserves of oil
and natural gas.
The Anglo-American oil giants also seek to gain
control over oil and gas pipeline routes out of the region.
Muslim countries including,
-
Saudi Arabia
-
Iraq
-
Iran
-
Kuwait
-
the United Arab Emirates
-
Qatar
-
Yemen
-
Libya
-
Nigeria
-
Algeria
-
Kazakhstan
-
Azerbaijan
-
Malaysia
-
Indonesia
-
Brunei,
...possess between 66.2 and 75.9 percent of
total oil reserves, depending on the source and methodology of the estimate.
(See table below).
In contrast, the United States of America has barely 2 percent of total oil
reserves. Western countries including its major oil producers ( Canada, the
US, Norway, the UK, Denmark and Australia) control approximately 4 percent
of total oil reserves. (In the alternative estimate of the Oil and Gas
Journal which includes Canada's oil sands, this percentage would be of the
the order of 16.5%. See table below).
The largest share of the World's oil reserves lies in a region extending
(North) from the tip of Yemen to the Caspian sea basin and (East) from the
Eastern Mediterranean coastline to the Persian Gulf.
This broader Middle East- Central Asian region,
which is the theater of the US-led "war on terrorism" encompasses according
to the estimates of World Oil, more than sixty percent of the World's oil
reserves. (See table below).
-
Iraq has five times more oil than the
United States.
-
Muslim countries possess at least 16
times more oil than the Western countries.
-
The major non-Muslim oil reserve
countries are Venezuela, Russia, Mexico, China and Brazil. (See
table)
Demonization is applied to an enemy, which
possesses three quarters of the world's oil reserves.
-
"Axis of evil"
-
"rogue States"
-
"failed nations"
-
"Islamic terrorists",
...demonization and vilification are the
ideological pillars of America's "war on terror".
They serve as a casus belli for waging
the battle for oil.
The Battle for Oil requires the demonization of those who possess the oil.
The enemy is characterized as evil, with a view to justifying military
action including the mass killing of civilians. The Middle East Central
Asian region is heavily militarized. (below map).
The oil fields are encircled:
NATO war ships stationed in the Eastern
Mediterranean (as part of a UN "peace keeping" operation), US Carrier
Strike Groups and Destroyer Squadrons in the Persian Gulf and the
Arabian deployed as part of the "war on terrorism".
All-nuclear formation:
Enterprise, Long Beach (CGN-9), and Bainbridge (CGN-25).
USS Enterprise Strike Group
The ultimate objective, combining military action, covert intelligence
operations and war propaganda, is to break down the national fabric and
transform sovereign countries into open economic territories, where
natural resources can be plundered and confiscated under "free market"
supervision.
This control also extends to strategic oil and
gas pipeline corridors (e.g. Afghanistan).
Demonization is a PSYOP, used to sway public opinion and build a consensus
in favor of war. Psychological warfare is directly sponsored by the Pentagon
and the US intelligence apparatus.
-
It is not limited to assassinating or
executing the rulers of Muslim countries, it extends to entire
populations
-
It also targets Muslims in Western
Europe and North America
-
It purports to break national
consciousness and the ability to resist the invader
-
It denigrates Islam
-
It creates social divisions
-
It is intended to divide national
societies and ultimately trigger "civil war"
While it creates an environment which
facilitates the outright appropriation of the countries' resources, at the
same time, it potentially backlashes, creates a new national consciousness,
develops inter-ethnic solidarity, brings people together in confronting the
invaders.
It is worth noting that the triggering of sectarian divisions and "civil
wars" is contemplated in the process of redrawing of the map of the
Middle East, where countries are slated to be broken up and transformed
into territories.
The map of the New Middle East, although
not official, has been used by the US National War Academy. It was recently
published in the Armed Forces Journal (June 2006). In this map, nation
states are broken up, international borders are redefined along
sectarian-ethnic lines, broadly in accordance with the interests of the
Anglo-American oil giants (map below).
The map has also been used in a training program
at NATO's Defense College for senior military officers.
MAP OF THE NEW MIDDLE EAST
Note: The following map was
prepared by Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters.
It was published in the Armed
Forces Journal in June 2006,
Peters is a retired colonel
of the U.S. National War Academy.

The Oil Lies in Muslim
Lands
The oil lies in Muslim lands.
Vilification of the enemy is part and parcel of
Eurasia energy geopolitics. It is a direct function of the geographic
distribution of the World's oil and gas reserves. If the oil were in
countries occupied predominantly by Buddhists or Hindus, one would expect
that US foreign policy would be directed against Buddhists and Hindus, who
would also be the object of vilification..
In the
Middle East war theater, Iran and Syria,
which are part of the "axis of evil", are the next targets according to
official US statements.
US sponsored "civil wars" have also been conducted in several other
strategic oil and gas regions including,
Ongoing US sponsored "civil wars", which often
include the channeling of covert support to paramilitary groups, have been
triggered in the Darfur region of Sudan as well as in Somalia, Darfur
possesses extensive oil reserves.
In Somalia, lucrative concessions have already
been granted to four Anglo-American oil giants.
"According to documents obtained by The
Times, nearly two-thirds of Somalia was allocated to the American oil
giants Conoco, Amoco [now part of BP], Chevron and Phillips in the final
years before Somalia's pro-U.S. President Mohamed Siad Barre was
overthrown and the nation plunged into chaos in January, 1991.
Industry sources said the companies holding
the rights to the most promising concessions are hoping that the Bush
Administration's decision to send U.S. troops to safeguard aid shipments
to Somalia will also help protect their multimillion-dollar investments
there."

Interests in Somalia, Global Research, 2002)
Globalization and the
Conquest of the World's Energy Resources
The collective demonization of Muslims, including the vilification of
Islam, applied Worldwide, constitutes at the ideological level, an
instrument of conquest of the World's energy resources.
It is part of the broader economic, political
mechanisms underlying the
New World Order.
Oil Reserves by Country
(Proven reserves in billions of barrels)
* Canada appears
according to this estimate as the Second Country in terms of
the size of proven reserves, due to the size of its
bituminous oil fields. The Oil & Gas Journal's oil reserve
estimate above for Canada includes 4.7 billion barrels of
conventional crude oil and condensate reserves and 174.1
billion barrels of oil sands reserves.
NOTES PERTAINING TO THE ABOVE
TABLE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF OIL RESERVES
Indicated are the world's main oil reserve countries. Countries with less
than 0.1 % of total reserves are not indicated.
The Oil and Gas Journal figures indicated above are based on proven oil
reserves including the bituminous oil fields (oil sands or tar sands). The
World Oil figures indicate oil reserves without the tar sands. The
difference between the two sets of figures largely pertains to the position
of Canada and Venezuela. The tar-sands are considered by some experts as not
recoverable with present technology and prices, although this issue is the
object of heated debate.
Muslim countries are indicated in bold. Percentages are rounded up to first
decimal.
In other recognized estimates, where the oil sands are not accounted for,
Canada's reserves are much lower (in billions of barrels):
BP notes that,
"the figure for Canadian oil reserves
includes an official estimate of Canadian oil sands 'under active
development'."
BP says of its data sources for oil reserves
that,
"the estimates in this table have been
compiled using a combination of primary official sources, third-party
data from the OPEC Secretariat, World Oil, Oil & Gas Journal and an
independent estimate of Russian reserves based on information in the
public domain. World Oil's Canadian oil reserve estimate "does not
include 174 billion bbl [barrels] of oil sands reserves."
