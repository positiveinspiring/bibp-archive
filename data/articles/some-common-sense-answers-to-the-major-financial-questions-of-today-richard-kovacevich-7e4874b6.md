Kovacevich spoke to SIEPR Associates about
Some Common Sense Answers to the Major Financial
Questions of Today.
Richard Kovacevich talks about
the FED requiring
banks to take bailout funds.
The Fed and the government needed this money to
be loaned out to increase the money supply. By giving member banks more
money, the FED wanted them to loan it out to the public, which would create
even more money.
Kovacevich says the that regulators simply
failed to do their jobs - no new regulations were needed.
TARP was simply a
cover-up for regulators corruption and negligence.
Financiers profited tremendously from the market
collapse, a collapse that they knew was coming because they saw the enormous
leverage and risk lenders were taking.
