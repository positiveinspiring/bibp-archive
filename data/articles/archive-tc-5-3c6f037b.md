Question: Speaking of President Kennedy, Joe A., in a personal note
to me a month or so ago, mentioned an interesting theory regarding
the killing of Kennedy.
He said:
"I personally think the two dollar
U.S. Treasury note that Kennedy had printed on which the Federal
Reserve bankers collected no interest, is a more credible reason for
his assassination."
A:
This Awareness indicates that this is in the affirmative; that this
Awareness has referred to this previously; that the entity violated
the bankers in doing this and knowingly moved the decimal point so
that he created a far greater number of these notes than was
intended by the bankers; that the entity did it in a manner that
would be perceived as having made a mistake, by moving the decimal
point, but in fact it was intentional.
This Awareness that this was
not the only reason for his assassination. This entity had done
several things of such nature, of such magnitude. The entity also
had affected the oil exploration tax in such a manner as to create a
greater taxation for the oil companies, and the entity was becoming
more aware of many of the intrigues associated with the banking
system.
This Awareness indicates also the entity had made a statement before
a student body; this appears to be Columbia University, although
this is not certain. The entity had made a statement ten days prior
to this assassination, that the office of the President had been
misused by powers against the American people, and that he intended
before he left office, to expose this evil.
This Awareness indicates
that the entity had essentially broken away from the establishment
to which his father had belonged. That once his father had a stroke,
the two sons, John and Robert, decided that they would go after the
mafia and all of those others who were subverting the United States
and see if they couldn't put this country back on its proper course.
This Awareness indicates that both were shown that they could not.
This Awareness indicates that it is also the same with Lincoln; that
when he put forth the Lincoln greenbacks, this entity managed to put
off the takeover of this country for almost a hundred years because
it affected the amount of interest available to the banks.
The
greenbacks prevented the banks from taking over on schedule; that
Lincoln was assassinated in part, because of this; that Kennedy was
assassinated in part because of his action also, which it too helped
to change the timetable for the takeover of this country through economic bankruptcy; this as being planned for the near future, as
this national debt has now reached such a proportion as to make this
almost inevitable. It is simply a matter of timing.
This Awareness indicates however, it is also a matter of whether or
not the ones who perpetrated this takeover can feel comfortable in
doing so, because the American people are beginning to catch on to
who in fact is running the operation, and what the motives and
purposes are. This Awareness indicates that if this awareness, and
this exposure and the awakening of the masses continues, then the
powers behind the scenes may not have the courage to take over.
This
Awareness indicates it is still a question, and there is no clear
answer at the moment, but if they were to take over at present, it
would not be an easy matter for them, and the likelihood is that if
they do not take over immediately, it will become ever more
difficult as time passes, for more entities will awaken.
This Awareness indicates again that it is important for entities who
wish to do something about this, to promote those books of Lindsey
Williams, to send these around, to inform others, to educate the
masses, as much as is possible, to get these into the hands of
leaders in your community and in your government.
