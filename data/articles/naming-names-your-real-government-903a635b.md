This is your real government; they transcend elected administrations, they
permeate every political party, and they are responsible for nearly every
aspect of the average American and European's way of life.
When the "left" is carrying the torch for two
"Neo-Con" wars, starting yet another based on the same lies, peddled by the
same media outlets that told of Iraqi WMD's, the world has no choice, beyond
profound cognitive dissonance, but to realize something is wrong.
What's wrong is a system completely controlled by a corporate-financier
oligarchy with financial, media, and industrial empires that span the globe.
If we do not change the fact that we are helplessly dependent on these
corporations that regulate every aspect of our nation politically, and every
aspect of our lives personally, nothing else will ever change.
The following list, however extensive, is by far not all-inclusive.
However after these examples, a pattern should
become self-evident with the same names and corporations being listed again
and again. It should be self-evident to readers of how dangerously pervasive
these corporations have become in our daily lives.
Finally, it should be self-evident as to how
necessary it is to excise these corporations from our lives, our
communities, and ultimately our nations, with the utmost expediency.
International Crisis
Group
www.crisisgroup.org
Background
While the International Crisis Group (ICG)
claims to be "committed to preventing and resolving deadly conflict,"
the reality is that they are committed to offering solutions crafted
well in advance to problems they themselves have created in order to
perpetuate their own corporate agenda.
Nowhere can this be better illustrated than in Thailand and more
recently in Egypt.
ICG member Kenneth Adelman had been backing
Thailand's Prime Minster
Thaksin Shinwatra, a former Carlyle Group
adviser who was was literally
standing in front of the CFR in NYC on the
eve of his ousting from power in a 2006 military coup.
Since 2006, Thaksin's meddling in Thailand
has been propped up by fellow Carlyle man James Baker and his Baker
Botts law firm, Belfer Center adviser Robert Blackwill of Barbour
Griffith & Rogers, and now Robert Amsterdam's Amsterdam & Peroff, a
major corporate member of the globalist Chatham House.
With Thailand now mired in political turmoil led by Thaksin Shinwatra
and his "red shirt" color revolution, the ICG is ready with "solutions"
in hand. These solutions generally involve tying the Thai government's
hands with arguments that stopping Thaksin's subversive activities
amounts to human rights abuses, in hopes of allowing the
globalist-backed revolution to swell beyond control.
The unrest in Egypt, of course, was led entirely by ICG member Mohamed
ElBaradei and his US State Department recruited, funded, and supported
April 6 Youth Movement coordinated by Google's Wael Ghonim.
While the unrest was portrayed as being
spontaneous, fueled by the earlier Tunisian uprising, ICG's ElBaradei,
Ghonim, and their youth movement had been in Egypt since 2010 assembling
their "National Front for Change" and laying the groundwork for the
January 25th 2011 uprising.
ICG's George Soros would then go on to fund Egyptian NGOs working to
rewrite the Egyptian constitution after front-man ElBaradei succeeded in
removing Hosni Mubarak.
This Soros-funded constitution and the
resulting servile stooge government it would create represents the ICG
"resolving" the crisis their own ElBaradei helped create.

Brookings Institute
www.brookings.edu
Background
Within the library of the Brookings
Institute you will find the blueprints for nearly every conflict the
West has been involved with in recent memory.
What's more is that while the public seems
to think these crises spring up like wildfires, those following the
Brookings' corporate funded studies and publications see these crises
coming years in advance. These are premeditated, meticulously planned
conflicts that are triggered to usher in premeditated, meticulously
planned solutions to advance Brookings' corporate supporters, who are
numerous.
The ongoing operations against Iran, including US-backed color
revolutions, US-trained and backed terrorists inside Iran, and crippling
sanctions were all spelled out in excruciating detail in the Brookings
Institute report, "Which
Path to Persia?"
The more recent UN Security Council
resolution 1973 regarding Libya uncannily resembles Kenneth Pollack's
March 9, 2011 Brookings report titled "The
Real Military Options in Libya."

Council on Foreign
Relations
www.cfr.org
Background & Notable Membership
A better question would be, who isn't in the
Council on Foreign Relations?
Nearly every self-serving career politician,
their advisers, and those populating the boards of the Fortune 500 are
CFR members. Many of the books, magazine articles, and newspaper columns
we read are written by CFR members, along with reports, similar to
Brookings Institute that dictate, verbatim, the legislation that ends up
before the West's lawmakers.
A good sampling of the most active wings of
the CFR
can be illustrated
best in last year's "Ground Zero Mosque" hoax, where CFR members from
both America's political right and left feigned a heated debate over New
York City's so-called Cordoba House near the 3 felled World Trade Center
buildings.
In reality, the Cordoba House was
established by fellow CFR member Feisal Abdul Rauf, who in turn was
funded by CFR financing arms including the Carnegie Corporation of New
York, chaired by 9/11 Commission head Thomas Kean, and various
Rockefeller foundations.

The Chatham House
www.chathamhouse.org.uk
Background & Membership
The UK's Chatham House, like
the CFR and the
Brookings Institute in America, has an extensive membership and is
involved in coordinated planning, perception management, and the
execution of its corporate membership's collective agenda.
Individual members populating its "senior panel of advisers" consist of
the founders, CEOs, and chairmen of the Chatham House's corporate
membership. Chatham's "experts" are generally plucked from the world of
academia and their "recent publications" are generally used internally
as well as published throughout Chatham's extensive list of member media
corporations, as well as industry journals and medical journals.
That
Chatham House "experts" are submitting
entries to medical journals is particularly alarming considering
GlaxoSmithKline and Merck are both Chatham House corporate members.
No better example of this incredible conflict of interest can be given
than the current Thai "red" color revolution being led by Chatham
House's Amsterdam & Peroff with consistent support lent by other
corporate members including the Economist, the Telegraph and the BBC.
In one case, the Telegraph printed, "Thai protests - analysis by Dr
Gareth Price and Rosheen Kabraji," within which Price and Kabraji make a
shameless attempt at defending the
Western-backed, Maoist themed,
violent protests.
While the Telegraph mentioned that Price and
Kabraji were both analysts for the Chatham House, they failed to tell
readers that the Telegraph itself retains a corporate membership within
the Chatham House as does the Thai protest leader's lobbyist, Robert
Amsterdam and his Amsterdam & Peroff lobbying firm.

Conclusion
These organizations represent the collective interests of the largest
corporations on earth.
They not only retain armies of policy wonks and
researchers to articulate their agenda and form a consensus internally, but
also use their massive accumulation of unwarranted influence in media,
industry, and finance to manufacture a self-serving consensus
internationally.
To believe that this corporate-financier oligarchy would subject their
agenda and fate to the whims of the voting masses is naive at best. T
hey
have painstakingly ensured that no matter who gets into office, in whatever
country, the guns, the oil, the wealth and the power keep flowing
perpetually into their own hands. Nothing vindicates this poorly hidden
reality better than
a "liberal" Nobel Peace Prize wearing president,
dutifully towing forward a myriad of "Neo-Con" wars, while starting yet
another
war in Libya.
Likewise, no matter how bloody your revolution is, if the above equation
remains unchanged, and the corporate bottom lines left unscathed, nothing
but the most superficial changes will have been made, and as is the case in
Egypt with International Crisis Group stooge Mohamed ElBaradei worming his
way into power, things may become substantially worse.
The real revolution will commence when we identify the above equation as the
true brokers of power and when we begin systematically removing our
dependence on them, and their influence on us from our daily lives.
The global corporate-financier oligarchy needs
us, we do not need them, independence from them is the key to our freedom.
