# Is Trump Disrupting the Cabal's Plan for a New World Order? - Trump says 
"We're Not Going Into Syria"

"President
Trump said the United States is not going into Syria' and
that he believes the situation would be better in the country
had Obama taken action, in an interview with Fox News."
Why This Is
Something We've Never Seen Before
Over decades and
decades of war and political turmoil, problems have arisen in a
number of countries, the best examples being the ones in the Middle
East, where the threat of terrorists is constantly pushed out to the
public.
The result of this
war on terror' has been a heightened national security state, one
where our rights are constantly stripped away to the point where we
now have mass surveillance.
There is a lot of
evidence that these attacks are indeed
false flags, carried out by
Western intelligence agencies/interests in order to justify the
invasion of other countries and install governments that better
serve the interests of the U.S. and their allies.
These attacks have
been happening for a long time, and each time, the U.S.
has intervened to play the role of the "hero."
So, what's going on
here?
Trump did state that,
"Syrian dictator Bashar
al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent
civilians. Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the
lives of helpless men, women and children.
It was a slow and brutal death
for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this
very barbaric attack."

There is more
evidence supporting the idea that this was a false flag event than
otherwise.
The evidence
showing that it was done by Bashar comes in the form of a mainstream
media news anchor saying that they have "reports" or "intelligence."
On the false flag terrorism side, there are documents, primary
sources, whistleblowers, and more.
But the fact that
Trump has decided not to intervene goes against the entire purpose
of false flag terrorism, which leads me to believe that there is a
battle going on right now between governments within the government.
That being said, it
is also confusing that he did confirm that this was an attack
carried out by Bashar.
Given his position
and the circles he runs in, you would think he knows about false
flag terrorism. During the election run he stated that ISIS was
created by the U.S., so what makes him hold his tongue here? Perhaps
he had some intel that we are not aware of.
The fact that Trump
has decided not to intervene is great news for those who
believe these acts are a result of false flag terrorism, part of
a plan that's been laid out for a long time to destabilize multiple
countries.
That plan was
leaked by Former Four Star General Wesley Clark, who was the
Supreme Allied Commander of Europe of NATO, in an interview with
Democracy Now. (source)
And the evidence
doesn't stop there.
This is a great
quote by historian
Richard Dolan that sums it up perfectly:
It is important to understand why Trump was demonized.
To be sure, his character makes it easy. There is no shortage of
narcissistic, sexist, or otherwise offensive statements in his
repertoire from which to draw.
But I have never and will never believe this is why he was
demonized. Ultimately, Trump is a disruptor, and his disruption
falls squarely against the two key pillars of the American
ruling elite's ideology: neoliberalism and neoconservatism.
Unlike traditional liberalism and conservatism, neoliberalism
and neoconservatism are not opposites.
Neoliberalism is just another name for transnational
globalization, while neoconservatism is nothing other than the
U.S.-dominated global empire project.
They work together, two inhuman, anti-human processes that
ensure a tiny minority of people control and own all the water,
minerals, drugs, GM foods, and everything else worth owning in
this world.
Hillary Clinton, as the ultimate representative of such an
agenda, received unwavering support from all segments of that
establishment, certainly from the media. Trump, on the other
hand, was vilified.
This is because, at least in his rhetoric, Trump showed that he
is not a reliable globalist or empire-builder.
Say what you want about him, but more than once he spoke to
hard-core Republican gatherings against the 2003 war in Iraq and
the unconscionable destruction in 2011 of the most prosperous
and successful nation in Africa: Libya.
What George W. Bush did to Iraq, Obama and Clinton (and Cameron
and Sarkozy) did to Libya, leaving it in a smoking heaping ruin
from which it may never recover in our lifetime.
As an aside, I remain astonished at my self-described
"progressive" friends who consistently overlook the obliteration
of Libya, all based on
lies and
greed.
The wreck of that nation will forever be a black stain on the
careers of Obama and Clinton, and on the legacy of the United
States as a whole.
So, by Trump not
intervening in Syria, he's clearly going against the wishes of some
very powerful people who control, as Eisenhower coined,
"the military
industrial complex."
(source)
But Trump's
decision is hardly surprising, given his clearly
anti-establishment stance on,
...and more.
He is opposing some very
powerful people in a lot of ways.
Indeed, a lot of
his connections are questionable, as are those of his
administration, but one point remains crystal clear:
He is not a
complete puppet, and he is not in favor of several dark agendas
that the administrations prior to him were and are trying to carry
out.
There is no doubt
in my mind that Hillary would have intervened in Syria, a move
which, the evidence suggests, was the real reason for the chemical
weapons attack.
So, what can we
expect?
We can now expect
Trump to be vilified even more for the fact that he refuses to go
into Syria and intervene. Mainstream media will demonize him for
letting people die, and not putting forth a humanitarian effort.
Meanwhile, this
could indeed be a heroic act, as this could be a move against the
cabal, one necessary to prevent these supposed false flag attacks in
the first place.
That being said,
Putin did say that more of these "false flag" attacks are being
prepared, in which case mainstream media will have even more power
to vilify Trump for not intervening, but we'll see what happens.
Governments Within
Governments - Who Is Perpetuating These Attacks If It's Not Trump's
Government?
Here's a great
quote from John F. Hylan, Mayor of New York City from 1918-1925:
"The real menace of our Republic
is the invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls
its slimy legs over our cities, states and nation... The little
coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the
United States government for their own selfish purposes.
They practically control both
parties... [and] control the majority of the newspapers and
magazines in this country.
They use the columns of these
papers to club into submission or drive out of office public
officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt
cliques which compose the invisible government. It operates
under cover of a self-created screen [and] seizes our executive
officers, legislative bodies, schools, courts, newspapers and
every agency created for the public protection."

This has been
expressed by multiple presidents and politicians from within the
system, including Trump.
To see more quotes
like this you can check out these two articles:
"There
exists a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own
Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue
its own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and
balances, and free from the law itself."
Senator Daniel K.
Inouye
A number of world
leaders have also called out this shadowy cabal, with the most
recent example being
Vladimir Putin.
It seems there is a
power within the Western military alliance that has completely
controlled most politicians.
I believe Obama,
Clinton, Bush, and
many others before them were all carrying out an agenda given to
them by this entity. This was made evident by their connections
to
the big banks and by the level of corporate control over
governmental policy when it comes to health, finance, politics, and
more.
This below video clip, further illustrate the point I'm trying to
make:
Regardless of what
you think of him, or what you've been told by mainstream media,
Donald Trump has taken a number of actions against this inside
group, with the latest being the decision to not intervene in Syria,
which could have been a false flag attack carried out by the cabal
that currently controls the U.S., but not by Donald Trump.
We've been
intervening all over the world for a very long time, but this is the
first time something like this has happened. It will be interesting
to see what happens next.
One thing is for
sure, we are living in a very interesting time, a time where a
massive shift in human consciousness is occurring. Much is coming to
light that was believed not to be try, and in turn this is
disrupting the belief systems of many.
Today, it's best to keep an
open mind rather than instantaneously dismiss something that has
solid evidence behind it, even if it does contradict your beliefs.
This is a necessary
step for the human race, we must truly identify the issue here and
sift through the lies if we are ever going to find a solution.
Seeing truth alone is a big part of that solution.
Who knows, perhaps
he is part of the cabal, and is simply waiting on the next false
flag attack to intervene.
Either way, it's
probably not his call.
