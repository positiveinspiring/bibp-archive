The private prison population in the US has rocketed 17-fold over the last
two decades mostly on the shoulders of the deep-pocketed prison lobby, and
the business continues to thrive.
Try confining yourself to a small room in your home, like a bathroom or a
closet, and spend a few hours there.
One only cringes to imagine the detrimental
psychological effects that kind of solitude creates for individuals who are
subjected to solitary confinement for years at a time, knowing only the
walls of their cell and the shades of light that creep across them.
The abhorrent state of affairs at the Guantanamo
facility often makes international headlines and arguably overshadows the
calamity that is the US domestic prison system - where over six million
people are subject to some form of correctional supervision, an amount
exceeding those who toiled in the Soviet gulags during Stalins reign. In
the United States, some fifty thousand inmates pass their days in solitary
confinement.
While there is undoubtedly no shortage of
violent criminals in Americas jails, millions are dolled out annually by
privately owned prison lobbies directly to politicians in an effort to
influence harsher zero tolerance legislation and mandatory sentencing for
many non-violent offenses.
While the US faces economic stagnation and unprecedented spending cuts to
programs of social uplift, business is booming for the private prison
industry.
Like any other business, these institutions are
run for the purpose of turning a profit. State and federal prisons are
contracted out to private companies who are paid a fixed amount to house
each inmate per day.
Their profit depends on spending the minimum
amount necessary on each inmate day-to-day, allowing private-hands to pocket
the remaining money.
For the corrections conglomerates of America,
success depends on housing the maximum numbers of inmates for the longest
potential time as inexpensively as possible. Consider that the United States
has the highest incarceration rate in the world, far surpassing any other
nation for every 100,000 Americans, 743 citizens sit behind bars.
The harsher sentences meted out to non-violent
offenders in contrast to other industrialized nations speaks volumes of
Americas enthusiastic embrace of a prison industrial complex.

The number of people imprisoned under state and federal custody increased
772% percent between 1970 and 2009, largely due to the incredible influence
that private corrections corporations wield against the American legal
system.
The argument is that by subjecting correctional
services to market pressures, efficiencies will be increased and prison
facilities can be run at a lower cost due to market competition.
What these privatizations produce in turn is a
system that destroys families by incentivizing the mass long-term detention
of non-violent criminals, a system that is increasingly difficult to
deconstruct and reform due to millions paid out to state and federal
policymakers.
According to
reports issued by advocacy group Public Campaign,
the three major corrections firms,
...have spent over $22 million lobbying Congress
since 2001.
As a means of influencing policymaking at the federal level, at least $3.3
million have been given to political parties, candidates, and their
political action committees, while more than $7.3 million has been given to
state candidates and political parties since 2001, including $1.9 million in
2010, the highest amount in the past decade.
Senators like Lindsay Graham and John
McCain have received significant sums from the private prison
corporations while Chuck Schumer, Chair of the Rules Committee on
Immigration and Border Enforcement, received at least $64,000 from
lobbyists.
The prison lobby thrives off of laws that
criminalize migrants and submit them to mandatory detention prior to being
deported, sometimes up to 10 months or more; private firms have consistently
pushed for the classification of immigration violations as felonies to
justify throwing more and more immigrants behind bars.
The number of illegal immigrants being
incarcerated inside the United States has risen exponentially under
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency responsible for annually
overseeing the imprisonment of 400,000 foreign nationals at the cost of over
$1.9 billion on custody-related operations.
The private prison industry has become increasingly dependent
on immigration-detention contracts, and the huge contributions of the prison
lobby towards drafting Arizonas controversial immigration law SB 1070 are
all but unexpected.
Arizona's SB 1070 requires police to determine
the immigration status of someone arrested or detained when there is
reasonable suspicion that theyve illegally entered the US, which many
view as an invitation for rampant racial profiling against non-whites.
While the administration of Arizonas Governor
Jan Brewer is lined with former private prison lobbyists, its
Department of Corrections budget has been raised by $10 million in 2012,
while all other Arizona state agencies were subject to budget cuts during
that fiscal year.
The concept of privatizing prisons to reduce
expenses comes at great cost to the inmates detained, who are subjected to
living in increasingly squalid conditions in jail cells across America.
In 2007, the Texas Youth Commission (TYC),
a state agency that overseas juvenile corrections facilities, was sent to a
West Texas juvenile prison run by GEO Group for the purpose of monitoring
its quality standards.

The monitors sent by the TYC were subsequently fired for failing to report
the sordid conditions they witnessed in the facility while they awarded the
GEO Group with an overall compliance score of nearly 100% - it was later
discovered that the TYC monitors were employed by the GEO Group.
Independent auditors later visited the facility
and discovered that inmates were forced to urinate or defecate in small
containers due to a lack of toilets in some of the cells.
The independent commission also noted in their
list of reported findings that the facility racially segregated prisoners
and denied inmates access to lawyers and medical treatment. The ACLU and
Southern Poverty Law Center have also highlighted several cases where GEO
Group facility administrators turned a blind eye to brutal cases of rape and
torture within their facilities, in addition to cases of its staff engaging
in violence against inmates.
According to the Justice Department data, nearly
210,000 prisoners are abused annually (prison personnel are found
responsible half the time), while 4.5 percent of all inmates reported sexual
assaults and rape.
Its not possible to conceive how such institutionalized repression can be
rolled back when the Obama administration shows only complicity with the
status quo - a staggering $18 billion was spent by his administration on
immigration enforcement, including detention, more than all other federal
law enforcement agencies combined.
Under Obamas watch, todays private prison
population is over 17 times larger than the figure two decades earlier.
Accordingly, Obamas drug czar, Gil
Kerlikowske, has condemned the recently passed state laws in Colorado
and Washington that legalize the possession of marijuana in small amounts.
The Obama administration is bent on keeping in place the current federal
legislation, where a first-time offender caught with marijuana can be thrown
in prison for a year.
Its easy to see why common-sense
decriminalization is stifled - an annual report released by the CCA in 2010
reiterates the importance of keeping in place harsh sentencing standards,
The demand for our facilities and services
could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts,
leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or
through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently
proscribed by our criminal laws.
For instance, any changes with respect to
drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the
number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby
potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.

Such is the nature of a perverted brand of capitalism, and todays model
bares little difference to the first private prisons introduced following
the abolishment of slavery in the late 1800s, where expansive prison farms
replaced slave plantations where predominately African-American inmates were
made to pick cotton and construct railroads in states such as Alabama,
Georgia and Mississippi.
Today, African-Americans make up 40% of the
prison population and are incarcerated seven times more often than whites,
despite the fact that African-Americans make up only 12% of the population.
Inmates are barred from voting in elections
after their release and are denied educational and job opportunities.
The disproportionate levels of black people in
prisons is undeniably linked to law enforcements targeting of intercity
black communities through anti-drug stipulations that command maximum
sentencing for possession of minute amounts of rock cocaine, a substance
that floods poor black neighborhoods.
Perhaps these social ills are byproducts of a system that places predatory
profits before human dignity. Compounding the illogic is that state spending
on prisons has risen at six times the rate of spending on higher education
over the past two decades.
Mumia Abu-Jamal, Americas most famous
political prisoner, has spent over three decades on death row; he was
convicted in 1981 for the murder of a white police officer, while forensic
experts say critical evidence vindicating Jamal was withheld from the trial.
In an interview with RT, Jamal relates his youth
activism with
the Black Panthers party against political
imprisonment in contrast to the present day situation,
We could not perceive back then of what it
would become
you can literally talk about millions of people
incarcerated by the prisoner-industrial complex today: men, women and
children.
And that level of mass incarceration, really
mass repression, has to have an immense impact in effect on the other
communities, not just among families, but in a social and communal
consciousness way, and in inculcation of fear among generations.
The fear and immortality the system perpetuates
shows no sign of abating.
Being one of the few growth industries the
United States has left, one can only imagine how many people will be living
in cages in the decades to come.
