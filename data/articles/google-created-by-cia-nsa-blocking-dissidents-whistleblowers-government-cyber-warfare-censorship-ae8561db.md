Appreciating DIFFERENT angles & tactics. Being
different is not a "crime", staying in your own integrity being appreciated
for your talents.
We do not have to agree on everything, as long
as we do not impose or hijacking other channels to force 1 issue or 1 group
(demonizing & generalizing). We need a different kind of unity against
tyranny.
We can inspire & motivate each other in so many
ways, KEY is: allowing each-other to be different as complementary forces
helping the network to counter any abuse & distractions of the real issues
at hand! For more insights, read my info on my frontpage.
