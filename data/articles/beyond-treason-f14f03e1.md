What you don't know about your government...
Department of Defense documents obtained through the
Freedom of Information
Act expose the horrific underworld of the disposable army mentality and the
government funded experimentation upon US citizens conducted without their
knowledge or consent.
UNMASKING SECRET MILITARY PROJECTS
Is the United States knowingly using a dangerous
battlefield weapon banned by the United Nations because of its long-term
effects on the local inhabitants and the environment?
Explore the illegal worldwide sale and use of
one of the deadliest weapons ever invented.
Beyond the disclosure of black-ops projects spanning the past 6 decades,
Beyond Treason also addresses the complex subject of Gulf War Illness. It
includes interviews with experts, both civilian and military, who say that
the government is hiding the truth from the public and they can prove it.
Beyond Treason focuses into the aftermath
of first Gulf war and the fact that American soldiers have been suffering 15
years of post-traumatic stress disorder. Because this explanation doesn't
cover all the symptoms that soldiers have had, U.S. Department of Defense's
says it's a "mystery disease". The main theme of Beyond Treason is to show
what really happened in the Middle-East in early 90's and how the soldiers
were exposed to depleted uranium.
And like if that hadn't been enough, the same
soldiers got untested vaccines. Beyond Treason is a patriotic and critical
documentary, that doesn't play guessing games but hits the viewer with cold,
hard facts.
Few veterans and experts of Gulf War talk in front of the camera about some
serious issues, and tell their views and experiences about the war and
origins of the disease - and also the neglects of U.S. Army towards their
own people.
Doug Rokke, ex-physicist and Director of
the U.S. Army Depleted Uranium Project gets the main share of interview time
and with a good reason. He has unquestionable amount information to tell and
convinces the viewer with his self-presentation.
Although the stories of soldiers that got sick during the war, are very
compelling to listen to - the film shows also horrifying images of deformed
babies to stress the seriousness of the facts. Is that social pornography?
Some might say it is, but it is the real option
to mainstream media, showing the true and dark side of the war. It is always
tough to see mutilated bodies, but some of these people were even alive when
the pictures were taken.
Besides the theme of Beyond Treason, it tells also the background of
dark history of U.S. governments human experiences. Secret documents of this
fact has been exposed to public lately.
Projects like MK-Ultra and Whitecoat get covered
in Beyond Treason - and remember, they are not conspiracy theories but
real stuff.
