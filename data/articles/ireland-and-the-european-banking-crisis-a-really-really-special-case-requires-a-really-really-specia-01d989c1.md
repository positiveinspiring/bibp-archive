# Ireland and The European Banking Crisis - A Really Really Special Case 
Requires a Really Really Special Solution

With considerable speculation about
an impending deal on bank debt, with the Taoiseach and the
German Chancellor jointly stating that Ireland is a 'special
case', it is helpful to remind ourselves just how special a
case we are.
Eurostat, the EU Commissions data
agency has calculated
the cost of the banking crisis in each EU country.
The
following focuses on the cost to general government budgets.
Ireland has really taken one for Team EU.
Yes, theres wee Ireland up at the
top, just edging out Germany for the dubious title of spending
the most on the banking crisis.
41 billion to date according to the
Eurostat accounting data (this doesnt count the billions
ploughed into the covered banks from our National Pension
Reserve Fund as this was not counted as a cost to the General
Government budget).
Of course, this doesnt give the
best picture.
What happens when we look at the
cost as a percentage of GDP?
Ireland may not win footballs
European Championship but when it comes to banking debt we are
Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester United all rolled into
one with Real Madrid for a bench.
Germany may have run Ireland close
in the nominal amount of banking debt but when it comes to a
proportion of GDP, it is just pennies behind their sofa. For
Ireland, its the entire house.
Heres another little stat to chew
on. The European banking crisis is just that - a European
crisis. But as we know, this has not been addressed at European
level. Rather, the cost has been delegated to individual
countries regardless of their size or ability to pay.
For instance:
Ok, were small.
So how much of the entire European
banking debt have we paid?
We may be minnows when it comes to
population and economic size, but when it comes to banking debt
we are the whale in the pond.
One more breakdown.
How much have countries paid per
capita?
The European banking crisis to date
has cost every individual in Ireland nearly 9,000 each. The
average throughout the EU is 192 per capita. I really dont
know what you can say after that.
So, Ireland is a really, really
special case. We require a really, really special solution. The
Government (and we must always remember that this mess wasnt
created on their watch) has a real challenge in the negotiations
over bank debt. But there is a bottom-line here.
If any deal does not qualitatively
alter these dismal statistics, then it wont be a deal worth
applauding. The Government may be tempted to return to the Irish
people waving a sheet of paper claiming a
bank debt deal for our time.
But if are still paying nearly
9,000 each while the remainder of the EU pays only a fraction
of that, then it is no deal at all; just a re-arranging of Euro
notes - a lot of Euro notes - on the decks of a sunken ship.
