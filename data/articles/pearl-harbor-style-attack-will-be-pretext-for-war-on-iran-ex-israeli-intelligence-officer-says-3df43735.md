Jerusalem Post article
implies U.S. will stage provocation to justify military assault
Former Israeli intelligence officer Avi Perry writes that a
surprise Pearl Harbor-style Iranian attack on an American warship in the
Persian Gulf will provide the pretext for the U.S. to launch all-out warfare
against Iran.
Given the fact that former Vice President
Dick Cheneys office openly considered
staging a false flag attack on a
U.S. vessel in the Persian Gulf to blame it on Iran as a pretext for war,
Perrys summation of how 2012 will see to a new war, cannot be taken
lightly.
Under the headline The looming war with Iran, Perry writes;
Iran, just like Nazi Germany in the 1940s,
will take the initiative and help the U.S. president and the American
public make up their mind by making the first move, by attacking a U.S.
aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian attack on an American military
vessel will serve as a justification and a pretext for a retaliatory
move by the U.S. military against the Iranian regime. The target would not
be Irans nuclear facilities.
The U.S. would retaliate by attacking Irans
navy, their military installations, missile silos, airfields. The U.S.
would target Irans ability to retaliate, to close down the Strait of
Hormuz. The U.S. would then follow by targeting the regime itself.
Elimination of Irans nuclear facilities? Yes. This part would turn out
to be the final act, the grand finale. It might have been the major
target, had the U.S. initiated the attack.
However, under this Pearl Harbor scenario,
in which Iran had launched a surprise attack on the U.S. navy, the
U.S.
would have the perfect rationalization to finish them off, to put an end
to this ugly game.
Perrys use of quotation marks around the word
surprise comes across as a literary device to imply that the so-called
surprise attack will not be a surprise at all.
Of course, the Pearl Harbor attack, which provided the pretext for Americas
formal entry into World War Two, was not a surprise by any means, it was
known well ahead of time.
Released Freedom of Information Act files prove that weeks before the
December 7 attack by the Japanese, the United States Navy had intercepted
eighty-three messages from Admiral Yamamoto which gave them details of
precisely when and where the attack would take place.
Its also completely nonsensical that Iran would actively seek to provide
the worlds pre-eminent nuclear superpower with an easy excuse to justify an
attack by deliberately targeting U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf.
Perrys article seems to be a tongue-in-cheek
admission that the U.S. or Israel will manufacture such an attack.
This presumption need not delve into the murky realm of conspiracy theories
- history tells us that fake naval attacks have been staged on numerous
occasions to hoodwink the American people into supporting wars of
aggression.
Remember
the Maine? The battleship USS Maine blew up while it was stationed
in Havana harbor in February 1898.
Although a Navy investigation could not find the
cause of the explosion, the American media, led by pioneer of yellow
journalism William Randolph Hearst, immediately blamed Spanish
saboteurs, whipping the public into a war fever.
When Hearst sent his reporter Frederick Remington to investigate,
little of note could be established about the disaster.
When Remington asked to be recalled, Hearst told
him,
Please remain. You furnish the pictures,
Ill furnish the war.
Hundreds of editorials demanded that the Maine and American honor be
avenged. Many Americans agreed. Soon a rallying cry could be heard
everywhere - in the papers, on the streets, and in the halls of
Congress: Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain.
As a result of an incident that many consider to
either be an accident or a deliberate false flag attack by the U.S. on its own
ship, the U.S. was at war with Spain within months.
Over 60 years later, another staged naval event, the Gulf of Tonkin
incident, was used as a pretext for the United States to launch the Vietnam
war.
President Johnson told the American public that North Vietnamese torpedo
boats launched an unprovoked attack against a U.S. destroyer on routine
patrol in the Tonkin Gulf.
Leaked cables and recordings of White House
telephone conversations later proved that the incident was completely
manufactured, and that our destroyers were just shooting at phantom targets
- there were no PT boats there, according to Navy squadron commander James
Stockdale, who was flying over the scene that night.
There was almost a 21st century version mirror of the Gulf of
Tonkin incident in January 2008, when the U.S. government announced that it
had been moments away from opening fire on a group of Iranian patrol boats
in the Strait of Hormuz after the boats allegedly broadcast a warning that
they were about to attack a U.S. vessel.
The Iranian warning later turned out to be of dubious origin, but the
incident led to a discussion in Vice-President Dick Cheneys office about
how to start a war with Iran by launching a false flag attack at sea,
according to Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh.
The January 2008 Strait of Hormuz incident taught Cheney and other
administration insiders that,
If you get the right incident, the American
public will support it, Hersh said.
There were a dozen ideas proffered about
how to trigger a war. The one that interested me the most was why dont
we build, we in our shipyard - build four or five boats that look like
Iranian PT boats. Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms. And next
time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz, start a shoot-up.
Might cost some lives.
Given the dangerous nature of
overlapping
Iranian and U.S./Israeli naval drills set to take place in the same region at
some point within the next two weeks, the potential for another staged
incident at sea that will be exploited as a pretext for war remains a potent
threat.
