The Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA)
Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM)
program seeks to find ways to utilize different remote robotic
manipulation systems that are controlled by humans.
This program is divided into 3 aspects:
-
Hardware: to design dexterous
multi-fingered robotic hands
-
Software: develop complex algorithms for
grasping, manipulation and sensory perception
-
Outreach: beta-testing robotics in
public forums to further study robotic autonomy
In 2010, DARPA revealed a robot at the
Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Conference in
Denver that was interactive in a public forum.
Participants would write software and have the
robot preform specified tasks. The goal of this event was to show that
robots were being developed by the US government to preform dangerous
tasks such as disarming an explosive device thereby reducing significant
human interaction.
Universities and other government-controlled
agencies such as Carnegie Mellon University, HRL Laboratories, iRobot,
NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory, SRI, and the University of Southern
California, provided teams of researchers to write software for DARPA.
Boston Dynamics, Inc., has been awarded a $10.9
million contract to manufacture humanoid robots that are bi-pedal, built
like humans and have a sensor head with on-board computing capabilities.
These robots are being created to assist in
excavation and rescue missions, according to
DARPA. They could also be employed to evacuation operations during
either man-made or natural disasters.
This week, the Project Offices for,
...revealed the Manned Unmanned System Integration Capability
(MUSIC) at Michael Army Airfield, Dugway Proving Ground, Utah.
During the
exercise, MUSIC showed that the US Army could use drones armed with lethal
weapons that were wired for precise communication with their operator.
The RQ-7 Shadow is another enhanced drone with
weapons capabilities. As the US Army endeavors to combine ground forces with
drone technology, their tactical operations success is multiplied.
The use of government-sponsored
universities such as Cornell, MIT and Delft University of Technology in
the Netherlands has created prototypes for bi-pedal robots that will someday
be the
synthetic army or police force.
Stanford Universitys Aerospace Robotics
Laboratory (ARL) wants to
introduce autonomous robots into law enforcement situations; such as
response in lieu of police SWAT teams.
Drones for law enforcement are being developed
with the creation of the
Talon SWAT/MP that can be configured with a multitude of weaponry. Some
include a multi-shot TASER, LRAD, 40mm grenade launcher, and a 12-gage
shotgun.
An earlier
version
of Talon, developed for the Israeli Defense Forces and the Israeli
Ministry of Defenses Directorate of Defense, was of the
VIPeR series that were equipped with a 9 mm mini-Uzi with scope and
pointer, or grenade launcher.
In 2006, Los Angeles began using
aerial drones to
spy over citizens under the guise of tracking suspects. The Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) subsequently ended that program. The police force
retaliated citing that,
there is
an immediate need by state and local public safety personnel for unmanned
aerial systems.
The Naval Research Laboratory has
developed SAFFiR, the Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot.
SAFFiR is
an autonomous bipedal humanoid robot, based on the CHARLI-L1 robot created
at Virginia Tech. This robot can interact with humans with a comprehensive
response system that utilizes language - including slang to make it more
familiar. A robot that can hold a conversation and fight fires is quite
impressive.
In 2009, with funding from the Pentagon, DARPA
created the Multifunction Utility/Logistics and Equipment (MULE) which was a
size of a Humvee. This robot car used sensors to drive autonomously and
calculate its target, await remote instructions or decide to fire.
MULEs potential has been in the works for the
last 3 years. Its advancement and use as a battlefield vehicle is being
tested and readied for deployment. The remote controls mirror those of a
gaming console which gives the operator the ease of playing a video game
while at the same time instructing a deadly piece of equipment on targeted
missions.
Unmanned ground vehicles have been in use since
Iraq and Afghanistan.
They are armed for combat with the same
capabilities as ground troops. MULEs development as an autonomous weapon
for the purpose of allowing a robot to decide on whether or not to carry out
a mission is advantageous to the US military.
A force of robotic peacekeepers that are
programmed to become violent without remorse will enable the government to
organize and act where human law enforcement and/or trained soldiers may
hesitate.
