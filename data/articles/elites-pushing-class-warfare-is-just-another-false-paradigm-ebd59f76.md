# Elites Pushing Class Warfare is Just Another False Paradigm

Why is it when the rich super class speaks about
class warfare, the downtrodden applaud?
When billionaire Warren Buffett
said,
"There's class warfare all right, but it's
my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning,"
...the struggling middle class treated him like
one of them, as if he's on their side.
More recently, billionaire investor George Soros warned of a coming class
war in the U.S. as
reported by the Daily Beast, where he proudly points out
that his prediction of riots in the streets has already begun.
With the Occupy movement's beginnings
having ties to funding by Soros, many
believe him to be stoking this so-called class warfare. Although Soros
denies directly funding the movement's beginnings, his vast philanthropic
contributions have far-reaching tentacles into many revolutions around the
globe.
Even if we are to naively take Soros' word that he was not involved in
spurring these global revolutions, despite the evidence to the contrary, he
clearly promotes the idea of class warfare with the political left cheering
him as a crusader for good.
Conveniently, the Occupy movement has adopted the catchy but brainless "us
versus the 1%" mantra as the rallying call for everyone in the 99% to blame
their problems on the so-called rich 1%. It sounds a lot like stoking class
warfare to me.
However, in order to instigate warfare there must be a crisis to cause
enough pain to force people to arms, and the sides of good and evil must be
defined.
Soros does just that in the Daily Beast article
where he says people,
have reason to be frustrated and angry at
the cost of bailing out the financial system, and that "the world faces
one of the most dangerous periods of modern history - a period of evil."
Of course, those statements are hard to argue
with and calling the ruling class "evil" will resonate with the masses. But
again, Soros is clearly in the ruling class 1%, so why would he, like
Buffett, pretend they're outsiders while stoking hatred toward themselves?
It seems they are using the crisis and class warfare paradigm to move the
masses to support what the global elite have been striving for all along:
less competition and more consolidation of power.
"In the crisis period, the impossible
becomes possible."
And by impossible he explains the Occupy
movement has,
"put on the agenda issues that the
institutional left has failed to put on the agenda for a quarter of a
century."
To further explain the nature of unintended
"evil" in the financial markets, Soros is quoted as saying in the same Daily
Beast article "Unrestrained competition can drive people into actions that
they would otherwise regret."
To many people, this echoes John D. Rockefeller's infamous quote
"Competition is a sin."
Rockefeller ran the monopoly oil company Standard Oil, which still exists to
this day but goes by different names:
-
Standard Oil of New Jersey became Esso,
later to be renamed Exxon - which became a key part of ExxonMobil,
currently the most profitable company in the world - earning 30
billion, 460 million dollars.
-
Standard Oil of California became
Chevron - currently the third most profitable company in the world
at 19 billion, 24 million dollars per year.
-
Continental Oil Company became Conoco,
now a part of ConocoPhillips - currently the sixteenth most
profitable company in the world at 11 billion, 358 million dollars.
-
BP Amoco is a conglomerate of several
Standard Oil splinter companies. Yahoo Finance currently lists BP
Amocos gross profit at 16 billion, 28 million dollars.
-
Therefore, four out of the six
supermajors in the oil industry are direct Rockefeller spinoffs -
BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.
Competition has been replaced by the appearance
of competition.
And this includes the apparent differences
between Soros and Buffett on the left versus
the Koch brothers on the right.
Those stuck in the left-right paradigm love to hate them, while they all
seek to eliminate genuine competition hidden behind their respective brands
of ideology.
Additionally, Soros
promotes a single European Treasury with the authority
to impose and collect taxes from all member nations as the solution to the Eurozone crisis. In America, he agrees with Buffett that the rich should pay
more in taxes to strengthen the institution of government, as if it hasn't
given enough power to itself despite its failings.
Furthermore, the notion that taxing the "rich" will solve any of America's
or Europe's financial problems may be the biggest false paradigm of all.
America officially has a national debt of around $15 Trillion with another
$26 Trillion in financial bailout costs and double that amount in upcoming
liabilities.
There is literally not enough wealth in the
world to fix that problem.
What's more, the real elite will never have to pay taxes as they move their
money globally and play on loopholes within the borders. Anyone remember
General Electric paying no taxes on $14.2 billion in profits; in fact they
got a
$3.2 billion tax credit from Americans.
Need I say more about the
silliness of this ever working in the current political environment?
So what does Soros say will be the next immediate battle of this rising
class war?
"As anger rises, riots on the streets of
American cities are inevitable. 'Yes, yes, yes,' he (Soros) says, almost
gleefully. The response to the unrest could be more damaging than the
violence itself.
It will be an excuse for cracking down and using strong-arm tactics to
maintain law and order, which, carried to an extreme, could bring about
a repressive political system, a society where individual liberty is
much more constrained, which would be a break with the tradition of the
United States."
As he says "gleefully."
Still want class warfare?
How about supporting the opposite:
