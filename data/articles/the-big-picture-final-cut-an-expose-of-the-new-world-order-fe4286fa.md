We have entered the Age of the Conjurer and it
is a tricky time.
The 911 stunt was a huge magic trick and we all bought it
at first. Magicians can be very convincing. You have to look very hard to
see the trick and not be fooled.
On this occasion slow motion exposes the
sleight of hand, but remember how the magician works: he can make almost
anything seem real if he can make his audience look in the wrong place at
crucial moments.
