The
Bush family, the Saudi Royal family, Osama Bin Laden's family and
Donald Rumsfeld's inner circle - these are just some of the high profile figures
who have played a direct role in the rise of one of the most powerful and
influential and secretive firms in Washington.
The company is called The
Carlyle Group.
And in the wake of
the events of September 11th and the
invasion of Iraq, its power and influence have become significantly
stronger. The company operates within the so-called iron-triangle of
industry, government and the military. Its list of former and current
advisers and associates includes a vast array of some of the most powerful
men in America and indeed around the world.
This program exposes the history
of the Carlyle Group, from it's inception as a private equity firm to it's
present status as one of the largest defense contractors in the world.
Note: The first minutes of this program is in
broadcast in Dutch, the
remainder is in English.
