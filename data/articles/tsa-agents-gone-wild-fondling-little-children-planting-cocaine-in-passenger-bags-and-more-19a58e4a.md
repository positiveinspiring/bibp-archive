TSA agents stand accused today of fondling the
genitals of women and little children as part of their "enhanced pat-down"
procedures being rolled out at airport security checkpoints.
Today, Michelle, an employee working at the Alex
Jones' InfoWars studios, has gone public with accusations that a male TSA
agent felt up her crotch and fondled her breasts at a security checkpoint in
Denver.
A male agent attempted to feel up the crotch of her little girl,
too.
You can watch the full video report below:
I've actually met Michelle in person, so I know she's a real person and I
recognize her voice from the video.
She's the customer service person at the
Alex Jones studios where I was a guest several weeks ago. She's a regular
American mom just trying to go from point A to point B without being
sexually assaulted by TSA agents. What TSA agents did to her, according to
her interview with Alex Jones, is consistent with a felony crime of "sexual
assault."
So now you have a choice at the airport:
You can either go through the X-Ray
machine, or you can subject yourself to an X-Rated pat-down by TSA agents.
Watch the video in the link above to learn more shocking details about
what's happening at TSA checkpoints today.
TSA agent drops
cocaine into travelers' bags
In a related story about the criminal behavior of TSA agents, TSA documents
released through a Freedom of Information Act request (FOIA) now reveal that
one TSA agent working the security checkpoint at Philadelphia International
Airport planted a white powdery substance that appeared to be cocaine
in the bags of air travelers.
This was no entry-level employee, either - released documents reveal he was
a "bomb appraisal officer."
He pulled this cocaine stunt multiple times, too. One time he confronted a
22-year-old college girl with the apparent cocaine and asked if she was
carrying anything she wasn't supposed to. After the prank, the student broke
down in tears from the terror of the event and eventually lodged a complaint
with the airline. (TSA agents are the new terrorists, see?)
TSA officers think it's funny to plant cocaine in your bags or feel up your
breasts. It's all part of the police state training, of course: It's not
merely about getting people to follow orders; it's also about humiliating
individuals to make them feel inferior to police state authorities.
The body searches these TSA agents conduct might be described in some cases
as sexual molestation and pedophile activities that would land anybody else
in federal prison.
Just for the record, however, when I was
subjected to a TSA
pat-down recently, they did not fondle my testicles at all. They actually swept my crotch with the back of their hand. I don't agree
with it, but I didn't feel as if I was being sexually molested. That was out
of the airport in San Jose, California.
So it appears that some TSA agents may be handling this very differently
than others. I might have felt different about the crotch sweeping if I were
a woman being felt up by a man, of course. I think what the TSA is doing is
highly inappropriate, especially when done to women and children.
We are not the terrorists here!
The TSA needs to stop with these ridiculous
"enhanced pat downs" and end the use of naked body scanner.
