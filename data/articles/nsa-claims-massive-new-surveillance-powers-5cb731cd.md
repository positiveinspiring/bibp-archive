# NSA Claims Massive New Surveillance Powers

Virtually no foreign government is off-limits
for the National Security Agency (NSA), which has been authorized to intercept
information "concerning" all but four countries, according to top-secret
documents.
The United States has long had broad no-spying
arrangements with those four countries - Britain, Canada, Australia and New
Zealand - in a group known collectively with the United States as
the Five Eyes:
NSA document on targeting Five Eyes countries
and territories
This document states that the
National Security Agency
is prohibited from conducting
foreign surveillance on the "Five
Eyes" countries,
which include U.S. allies Australia,
Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom,
or their territories.

But a
classified 2010 legal certification and other documents indicate the NSA
has been given a far more elastic authority than previously known, one that
allows it to intercept through U.S. companies not just the communications of
its overseas targets but any communications about its targets as well.
The certification - approved by the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court and included among a set of documents leaked by former NSA
contractor
Edward Snowden -
lists 193 countries that would be of valid interest for U.S.

List of foreign governments and organizations
authorized for surveillance
This exhibit lists the 193 foreign governments
as well as foreign factions, political
organizations and other entities
that were part of a 2010 certification
approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
These are the entities about which the
NSA may conduct surveillance,
for the purpose of gathering foreign
intelligence.
Each year a new certification must be
approved by the court
to permit such surveillance under
Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.

The certification also permitted the agency to
gather intelligence about entities including,
The NSA is not necessarily targeting all the
countries or organizations
identified in the certification, the affidavits and an accompanying
exhibit; it has only been given authority to do so.
Still, the privacy implications are
far-reaching, civil liberties advocates say, because of the wide spectrum of
people who might be engaged in communication about foreign governments and
entities and whose communications might be of interest to the United States.
"These documents show both the potential
scope of the government's surveillance activities and the exceedingly
modest role the court plays in overseeing them," said Jameel Jaffer,
deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, who had
the documents described to him.
NSA officials, who declined to comment on the
certification or acknowledge its authenticity, stressed the constraints
placed on foreign intelligence-gathering.
The collection must relate to a foreign
intelligence requirement - there are thousands - set for the intelligence
agencies by the president, the director of national intelligence and various
departments through the National Intelligence Priorities Framework.
Furthermore, former government officials said,
it is prudent for the certification to list every country - even those whose
affairs do not seem to immediately bear on U.S. national security interests
or foreign policy.
"It's not impossible to imagine a
humanitarian crisis in a country that's friendly to the United States,
where the military might be expected on a moment's notice to go in and
evacuate all Americans," said a former senior defense official who spoke
on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
"If that certification did not list the
country," the NSA could not gather intelligence under the law, the
former official said.
The documents shed light on a little-understood
process that is central to one of the NSA's most significant surveillance
programs: collection of the e-mails and phone calls of foreign targets under
Section 702 of the 2008 FISA Amendments Act.
The foreign-government certification, signed by
the attorney general and the director of national intelligence, is one of
three approved annually by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court,
pursuant to the law. The other two relate to counterterrorism and
counter-proliferation, according to the documents and former officials.
Under the Section 702 program, the surveillance
court also approves rules for surveillance targeting and for protecting
Americans' privacy. The certifications, together with the National
Intelligence Priorities Framework, serve as the basis for targeting a person
or an entity.
The documents underscore the remarkable breadth
of potential "foreign intelligence" collection. Though the FISA Amendments
Act grew out of an effort to place under statute a surveillance program
devoted to countering terrorism, the result was a program far broader in
scope.
An affidavit in support
of the 2010 foreign-government certification said the NSA believes that
foreigners who will be targeted for collection,
"possess, are expected to receive and/or are
likely to communicate foreign intelligence information concerning these
foreign powers."
That language could allow for surveillance of
academics, journalists and human rights researchers.
A Swiss academic who has information on the
German government's position in the run-up to an international trade
negotiation, for instance, could be targeted if the government has
determined there is a foreign-intelligence need for that information.
If a U.S. college professor e-mails the Swiss
professor's e-mail address or phone number to a colleague, the American's
e-mail could be collected as well, under the program's court-approved rules.
Even the no-spy agreements with the Five Eye
countries have exceptions.
The agency's principal targeting system
automatically filters out phone calls from,
-
Britain
-
Canada
-
Australia
-
New Zealand
But it does not do so for their 28 sovereign
territories, such as the British Virgin Islands.
An NSA policy bulletin
distributed in April 2013 said filtering out those country codes would slow
the system down.
"Intelligence requirements, whether
satisfied through human sources or electronic surveillance, involve
information that may touch on almost every foreign country," said
Timothy Edgar, former privacy officer at the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence and now a visiting fellow at Brown University's
Watson Institute for International Affairs.
Those efforts could include surveillance of all
manner of foreign intelligence targets - anything from learning about
Russian anti-submarine warfare to Chinese efforts to hack into American
companies, Timothy Edgar said.
"It's unlikely the NSA would target
academics, journalists or human rights researchers if there was any
other way of getting information," he said.
A spokeswoman for the NSA, Vanee Vines,
said the agency may only target foreigners,
"reasonably believed to be outside the
United States."
Vines noted that in January, President
Obama
issued a policy directive stating that U.S. surveillance "shall be as
tailored as feasible."
He also directed that the United States no
longer spy on dozens of foreign heads of state and that sensitive targeting
decisions be subject to high-level review.
"In short, there must be a particular
intelligence need, policy approval and legal authorization for U.S.
signals intelligence activities, including activities conducted pursuant
to Section 702," Vines said.
On Friday, the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence released a
transparency report stating that in 2013 the government targeted nearly
90,000 foreign individuals or organizations for foreign surveillance under
the program.
Some tech-industry lawyers say the number is
relatively low, considering that several billion people use U.S. e-mail
services.
Still, some lawmakers are concerned that the
potential for intrusions on Americans' privacy has grown under the 2008 law
because the government is intercepting not just communications of its
targets but communications about its targets as well.
The expansiveness of
the foreign-powers certification increases that concern.
In a
2011 FISA court opinion, a
judge using an NSA-provided sample estimated that the agency could be
collecting as many as 46,000 wholly domestic e-mails a year that mentioned a
particular target's e-mail address or phone number, in what is referred to
as "about" collection.
"When Congress passed Section 702 back in
2008, most members of Congress had no idea that the government was
collecting Americans' communications simply because they contained a
particular individual's contact information," Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.),
who has co-sponsored legislation to narrow "about" collection
authority, said in an e-mail to The Washington Post.
"If 'about the target' collection were
limited to genuine national security threats, there would be very little
privacy impact. In fact, this collection is much broader than that, and
it is scooping up huge amounts of Americans' wholly domestic
communications."
Government officials argue that the wholly
domestic e-mails represent a tiny fraction - far less than 1 percent - of
the volume collected.
They point to court-imposed rules to protect the
privacy of U.S. persons whose communications are picked up in error or
because they are in contact with foreign targets.
In general, if Americans' identities are not
central to the import of a communication, they must be masked before being
shared with another agency.
Communications collected from companies that
operate high-volume cables - instead of directly from technology firms such
as Yahoo or Google - are kept for two years instead of five. Some of the
most sensitive ones are segregated and may not be used without written
permission from the NSA director.
Privacy advocates say the rules are riddled with
exceptions.
They point out that wholly domestic
communications may be kept and shared if they contain significant foreign
intelligence, a term that is defined broadly, or evidence of a crime.
They
also note that the rules allow NSA access to certain attorney-client
communications, pending review by the agency's general counsel.
Jennifer Granick, the director of civil
liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, expressed concern
about the prospect of capturing e-mails and phone calls of law-abiding
foreigners.
"The breadth of the certification suggests
that the court is authorizing the government to spy on average
foreigners and doesn't exercise much if any control beyond that," she
said.
Some former officials say that the court's role
has been appropriately limited when it comes to foreign targeting decisions,
which traditionally have been the purview of the executive branch.
The court generally has focused on ensuring that
domestic surveillance is targeted at foreign spies or agents of a foreign
power.
"Remember, the FISA court is not there to
protect the privacy interests of foreign people," the former defense
official said.
"That's not its purpose, however noble the
cause might be. Its purpose is to protect the privacy interests of
persons guaranteed those protections under the Constitution."
The only reason the court has oversight of the
NSA program is that Congress in 2008 gave the government a new authority to
gather intelligence from U.S. companies that own the Internet cables running
through the United States, former officials noted.
Edgar, the former privacy officer at the Office
of the Director of National Intelligence, said ultimately he believes the
authority should be narrowed.
"There are valid privacy concerns with
leaving these collection decisions entirely in the executive branch," he
said.
"There shouldn't be broad collection, using
this authority, of foreign government information without any meaningful
judicial role that defines the limits of what can be collected."
