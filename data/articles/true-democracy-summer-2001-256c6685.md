TRUE DEMOCRACY SUMMER 2001 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Project Paperclip
Stephen R. Weissman's book "American Foreign Policy in the Congo:
1960-1964," Cornell University Press, 1974 describes how the
CIA got deeply involved there at that time and certain U.S. businessmen
had financial interests there. The Rockefellers come up a lot. These
are the very same people who were behind Project Paperclip.
CIA: BASTION OF INTEGRITY
"Somehow we all end up paying for what we do."
-Bill Clinton
O
n January 25, 1993, a lone assassin calmly walked among cars stopped at a
stop light with an assault rifle and shot and killed two CIA personnel and
wounded three others. The suspect, Mir Aimal Kansi, was placed on the FBI
list of ten most wanted fugitives.
The FBI, in concert with the CIA, conducted a multi-national
manhunt to bring the criminal to justice. On Sunday, June 15, 1997, Mir Aimal
Kansi was apprehended. As the CIA, in alliance with the military, applauded
the courage and valor of the men who brought the lone killer to justice,
they forgot the thousands upon thousands of injustices calmly done by this
very same institution. President Clinton failed to remember as well when
he remarked, "The United States will not relent in the pursuit of those who
use violence against Americans to advance their goals no matter how long
it takes, no matter where they hide." CNN 6/18/97.
In 1947 the CIA operation sprang out of the Office
of Strategic Services (OSS). It was supposed to be an intelligence gathering
agency. It was also supposed to counteract the "plots" of "commie [communist]
spies" who were undermining U.S. freedom. It was reported that the "commie
spies" were going to use propaganda and brainwashing techniques to instill
into American thinking "communist socialism" ideology. We were all sure that
we needed to counteract their insidious plots. This was the "Cold War" between
U.S. freedom and Russian "brainwashing".
The CIA's statement of itself when it is examined
in the light of its past performance seems somewhat enigmatic. When the statement
is read with their special glasses on, they portray themselves to be a flag-waving
righteous agency working for the benefit of the world and its people, but
when we do a reality check, "found wanting" is a gross understatement. We
should consider the CIA's statement of itself and then examine that statement
in the light of its beginning and its history.
"Our Vision:
* To be the keystone of a U.S. Intelligence community that is pre-eminent
in the world, known for both the high quality of our work and the excellence
of our people.
Our Mission:
* Conducting counterintelligence activities, special activities, and other
functions related to foreign intelligence and national security as directed
by the president.
How We Do Our Work:
* Accepting accountability for our actions.
* Continuous improvement in all that we do."
CIA Vision, Mission, and Values
It may open one's eyes to look at some of this agency's
"high quality" people known for "excellence" that have operated as directed
by the president. Just a few statements made by those who should know what
they are talking about begin to form the picture.
EXCELLENCE IN PERSONNEL
William (Wild Bill) Donovan, Coordinator of Information
by FDR, recruited a Cornell graduate from Boston named Stanley Lovell. Lovell
described his work as follows: "What I have to do is to stimulate the Peck's
Bad Boy beneath the surface of every American scientist and say to him, 'Throw
all your normal law-abiding concepts out the window. Here's a chance to raise
merry hell. Come help me raise it.'" Mind Manipulators, Scheflin and Opton.
p.241.
George Hunter White wrote of his CIA escapades .
. . "I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun, fun, fun"
...."Where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal,
rape and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the all-highest?" Captain
George White in a letter to Dr. Sidney Gottlieb.
A retired CIA agency caseworker with twenty years
experience states of his work: "I never gave a thought to legality or morality.
Frankly, I did what worked." With statements such as these we can clearly
see that men with no scruples about human decency or morality would be "excellent"
in their "special functions." It cannot be forgotten that these special operations
are all carried out under the orders of the president.
It would be well for us to consider some of the
early "special operations" to see who the enemy actually was. Once more,
just a few of many "special operations" of the CIA begins to draw back the
mask on its activities.
HOW WE DO OUR WORK
Operation Midnight Climax was a series of CIA run
brothels in San Francisco and New York. The operation paid prostitutes $100
a day to lure men into the net. The prostitutes spiked their Johns' drinks
with LSD. The CIA, plentifully supplied with martinis, watched the action
from behind closed doors and one-way mirrors. Not only was this operation
illegal as were many others, but the men who were "experimented" upon had
no idea that they were the objects of experimentations. The prostitutes were
guaranteed their safety should they get caught plying their trade while engaged
in this "special operation".
A secret laboratory was established and funded by
CIA director, Allen Dulles in Montreal, Canada at McGill University in the
Allen Memorial Institute headed by psychiatrist Dr. Ewen Cameron. For the
next several years Dr. Ewen Cameron waged his private war in Canada. What
is ironic about Dr. Cameron is that he served as a member of the Nuremberg
tribunal who heard the cases against the Nazi doctors.
When it was at its height in drug experiments, operation
MK-ULTRA was formed. This was the brainchild of Richard Helms who later came
to be a CIA director. It was designed to defeat the "enemy" in its brain-
washing techniques. MK-ULTRA had another arm involved in Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW) known as MK-DELTA. The "doctors" who participated in these
experiments used some of the same techniques as the Nazi "doctors". Those
doctors who were not indicted in the Nuremberg trials were imported from
Germany under the program called "Operation Paperclip." The Nazi doctors
were a valuable source of information to the CIA since many of the U.S. techniques
mimicked what had already been done by the Nazis. German doctors were prosecuted
at the Nuremberg trials for similar criminal acts that the U.S. experimenters
carried out - and this was all done at the same time period as the American
experiments were taking place. The real motto here should be: Let's pursue
relentlessly the wicked Nazi doctors, Russian spies, and lone assassins and
forget about our "special operations".
Just as Nazi Germany had its "expendables" the CIA
had theirs. Among the expendables the CIA had were, war prisoners, prostitutes,
sexual psychopaths, prison inmates, certain war objectors, mentally retarded
people, the elderly, terminally ill patients, schizophrenics, drug addicts,
foreigners and, of course, any other man, woman or child who would fit the
bill of need.
Some of the CIA tortures carried out involved sensory
deprivation, bodily function deprivation and sleep deprivation in rooms with
no windows and continuous light. Other forms of mind control involved drug
- induced comas, a wide variety of drugs, brain surgery (pre-frontal lobotomy),
massive Page-Russell electric shocks, and electo-convulsive treatments combined
with endless interrogations that were tape recorded. These interrogations
were calculated to induce certain required answers from the "patient." These
tape recorded sessions were then played back to the patient by means of a
helmet outfitted with headphones. The helmet was worn for days with the tape
playing endlessly. Many times a combination of these techniques was used
until the broken patient would succumb to death. Many that entered the walls
of the laboratories would never see family, friends or the light of day again.
To say it was a living hellish nightmare for most, would put it mildly.
These "special operations" were funded by the CIA
through various intermediaries. Some had large financial interests in drug
experiments. One such company was the Eli LillyCompany who told the CIA at
its height of LSD manufacture that it could supply tons of the drug. George
Bush, who was a CIA director and director of the President's U.S. Drug Task
Force, was also director of Eli Lilly Company from 1977-1979. (The Big Book
of Conspiracies, Doug Moench, p. 111).
This does not take into account all the transactions
of vice, drug dealing, torture, extortion, foreign country political interferences,
assassination plots, murder implications, presidential assassination conspiracies,
money laundering, propaganda, and covert operations domestic and abroad.
While the agency says it has "cleaned up its act" and has released to the
public scrutiny some of its past operations under the Freedom of Information
Act, (FOIA) can we trust this powerful agency to tell us the truth?
JUST TRUST US
Richard Helms as acting CIA director was asked about
secret CIA operations. He justified the CIA in an address to the National
Press Club when he said: "You've just got to trust us. We are honorable men."
New York Review of Books 12/30/71 from Inside the Company, by Philip Agee.
Trusting the CIA with a history as it has, would be tantamount to being locked
in a den of roaring lions and trusting to get out unscathed.
So now we come to the point about the CIA's position
on taking responsibility. Do they really take responsibility for their actions
or do we have a network of secrecy that extends from the president to CIA
personnel?
Here is what President Truman said of the CIA and
its creation, "I think that it was a mistake. And if I'd known what was going
to happen, I never would have done it.... But it got out of hand.... Now
as nearly as I can make out, those fellows in the CIA don't just report on
wars and the like, they go out and make their own and there is nobody to
keep track of what they are up to. They spend billions of dollars on stirring
up trouble so they will have something to report on. They've become . . .
it's become a government of all its own and all secret. They just don't have
to report to anybody. . . . The people have got a right to know what those
birds are up to.
. . . You've got to keep an eye on the military
at all times, and it doesn't matter whether it's the birds in the Pentagon
or the birds in the CIA." Merle Miller, Plain Speaking: an Oral Biography
of Harry S. Truman, pp. 391-2. While Truman states this about the agency,
he is not free of liability. He set it up.
The agency has an understanding among its members
called plausible deniability. Plausible deniability simply means your subordinates
understand what to do without written authorization or verbal communication
taking place. Therefore, there is no paper trail or even a verbal communication
taking place that can be traced or verified. After all, what would it do
to "national security" for the world to know that the president was directing
"special operations" for fun and profit?
What is the real mission of this agency who does
not need to answer to the public? Once the records are unveiled under the
FOIA , why are the names of the key players always edited out? Why has the
president issued a specific Executive Order (EO #12958) to the intent that
no names are to be revealed? Why is the CIA, the president and the military
always so concerned about "national security?" What are they afraid of revealing?
That the "Cold War" was invented just so the CIA
could carry out its own mind control operations with the blessing of the
American public is very likely. In political trials the CIA seized the convenient
opportunities to justify their own course of actions. "That the CIA was able
to take an old form of torture, dress it up with a lurid name, and convince
the public that a new technique for mind subversion was being practiced by
Communist nations, is a propaganda coup of stunning proportions." ..."The
Soviet, Chinese and Korean brainwashing techniques were fully known to U.S.
intelligence services. There was absolutely no basis, in fact, to allege
that the communists had started brain warfare. It is not entirely impossible
that the brainwashing scare was created by the CIA because it wanted to do
mind control research and considered that the safest way to get authorization
was to allege that the Soviets had done it first." Mind Manipulators, Scheflin
and Opton p. 225. " According to a CIA document dated January 14, 1953, 'Apparently
their (Russian) major emphasis is on the development of specially trained
teams for obtaining information without the use of narcotics, hypnosis, or
special mechanical devices.' A memo issued the next day by the Ad Hoc Medical
Study Group admitted that 'the present state of knowledge indicates little,
if any, threat to National Security through 'special interrogation' techniques
or agents.'" Acid Dreams, Lee and Shlain p. 17.
OUR MISSION
What we really have is a secret all-out war of the
government against its own citizens carried out at the citizens expense.
The U.S. paid the CIA to fight against itself not only with tax dollars and
loss of freedom, but with severe body and mind damage. Many paid with their
lives. There are several cases that have come to court where victims and
families are suing for over a million dollars each and we may consider who
pays for that? Are the perpetrators sued? Do the responsible governmental
agencies step forward and take accountability? No! Names are withheld in
the interest of "national security." Not only is this war carried out nationally,
but it is carried out on a worldwide scale, and the war has carefully implemented
the very type of society that it was supposed to fight. It has been the perfect
propaganda ploy. Is it any wonder that other countries refer to the U.S.
as the "Great Satan." Only the devil would dream up a scheme where a country
would be tortured, pay for it and be convinced it is for its best interest.
Now that the country is convinced of the necessity of the tortures and the
necessity of paying for it, it will be carried to the bloody end.
In 1969 a man was taken to prison and sentenced
for horrifyingly brutal crimes. As he spoke in his own behalf near the trial's
end, he may have been the prophet of what is coming. He said, "These children
that come at you with knives, they are your children. You taught them. I
didn't teach them. I just tried to help them stand up.
"Most of the people at the ranch that you call the
Family were just people that you did not want, people that were alongside
the road that their parents had kicked out, that did not go to Juvenile Hall.
So I did the best I could and I took them up on my garbage dump and I told
them this: that in love there is no wrong....
"You did not give them warmth you gave them death,
I am only what lives inside each and every one of you....
"What about your children? . . . You say there are
just a few? There are many, many more, coming in the same direction. They
are running in the streets - and they are coming right at you!" Charles Manson.
Helter Skelter, Vincent Bugliosi.
There is the possibility that the Attorney General,
Robert Horan may ask for the death penalty for Mir Aimal Kansi. If he does
and Clinton's quote is fulfilled which says, "Somehow we all end up paying
for what we do", then he may be committing to death the country and its clandestine
agencies for what they do. Would it not seem fair that the perpetrators of
a crime should receive the same penalty as those striking back in retaliation?
Are the actions of Mir Aimal Kansi only the beginning of the mountain of
crimes that will roll back upon a government that sanctions such criminal
activity and then pursues with relentless fury those who retaliate? While
it is not the opinion of the author that one wrong sets right the actions
of another wrong, or that violence calls for violence in retaliation, the
cause and effect relationship is there just the same. Not all the people
can be fooled (mind-controlled) all the time.
It seems that the mind control the CIA has so freely
exercised upon the world has rebounded into its own operation. They have
been brain-washed into believing that the "Company" now operates with integrity
and honesty. Or have they? Is this just another set-up to convince the rest
of us of CIA integrity? If the world swallows the lie and believes in the
honesty and integrity of this agency, then the years of mind control methods
they have used have been very successful.
"And it seems to me perfectly in the cards that
there will be within the next generation or so a pharmacological method of
making people love their servitude, and producing . . . a kind of painless
concentration camp for entire societies,
so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but
will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to
rebel by propaganda, brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological
methods." Aldux Huxley, 1959.
As a wise Observer said years ago,
"Whatsoever a man sows that shall he also reap."
