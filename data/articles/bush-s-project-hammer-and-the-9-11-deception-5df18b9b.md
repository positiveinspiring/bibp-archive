Wanta 6is not mentioned here
but he was pivotal in the intelligence
operations
against the Soviet ruble from 1988!
In 1989 President
George H. W. Bush began the
multi-billion dollar
Project Hammer program using an investment
strategy to bring about the economic destruction of the Soviet Union
including the theft of the Soviet treasury, the destabilization of the
ruble, funding a KGB coup against Gorbachev in August 1991 and the seizure
of major energy and munitions industries in the Soviet Union.
Those resources would subsequently be turned
over to international bankers and corporations.
On November 1, 2001, the second operative in the
Bush regime, President George W. Bush, issued
Executive Order 13233 on the basis of
national security and concealed the records of past presidents, especially
his fathers spurious activities during 1990 and 1991. Consequently, those
records are no longer accessible to the public. [1]
The Russian coup plot was discussed in June 1991
when Yeltsin visited with Bush in conjunction with his visit to the United
States. On that same visit, Yeltsin met discreetly with Gerald
Corrigan, the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve. [2]
Because of numerous Presidential Executive Orders, the ethically
questionable Project Hammer was deemed legal. Of course, even Hitlers
acts were lawful, as he had manipulated the laws to accommodate his
actions.
Many of Reagans executive orders were actually
authored by Vice President Bush or his legal associates, and it is possible
that Project Hammer was created by Reagans CIA Director, William Casey,
who had directed OSS operations through Alan Dulles in Europe during World
War II.
Prior to his OSS affiliation, Casey worked for
the Board of Economic Warfare which allegedly targeted Hitlers economic
jugular. [3]
Allen Dulles, brother of John Foster
Dulles, was the Director of the CIA from 1953 to 1961. He was a senior
partner at the Wall Street firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, which represented
the Rockefeller Empire and other mammoth trusts, corporations and cartels.
Project Hammer was staffed with CIA operatives and others associated with
the National Security apparatus. Covert channels were already in place as a
result of other illegal Bush activities.
Thus, it was a given,
-
that the project would use secret,
illegal funds for unapproved covert operations
-
that the American public and Congress
would not be informed about the illegal actions perpetrated in
foreign countries
The first objective was allegedly to crush
Communism, a growing political philosophy and social movement that was
initially funded by the usual group of international bankers who now
supported their demise.
To this end,
the Vulcans,
under George H. W. Bush, waged war against the Soviet Union. [4]
The Return of the
Vulcans
In their reincarnation in the administration of George W. Bush, the Vulcans
functioned as a supposedly benign group, led by Council of Foreign
Relations (CFR)
member Condoleezza Rice, who attempted to augment and compensate for
the Bushs lack of experience and education concerning foreign policy during
his presidential campaign.
Rice had been President George H. W. Bushs
Soviet and East European Affairs Advisor in the National Security Council
during the Soviet Unions dissolution and during the German reunification
(July 1, 1990).
The resurrected Vulcan group included,
-
Richard Armitage
-
Robert Blackwill
-
Stephen Hadley
-
Richard Perle
-
Rabbi Dov S. Zakheim
-
Robert Zoellick
-
Paul Wolfowitz
Other key campaign figures included,
-
Dick Cheney
-
George P. Shultz
-
Colin Powell,
...all influential but not actually a part of
the Vulcan Group.
All of these people, associated with the George
H. W. Bush administration, returned to powerful, strategic positions in
George W. Bushs administration.
Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz have been accused of being agents for the
Israeli government. Investigations by Congress and the FBI have
substantiated those allegations. Zakheim and his family were heavily
involved in
Yeshivat Shaalvim, an educational
organization in which students are taught to render absolute commitment to
the State of Israel. [5]
Many of these individuals were also members of the Project for a New
American Century (PNAC)
which was established in the spring of 1997 with the intention of promoting
American Global leadership at any cost.
The chairman and co-founder was William
Kristol, son of Irving Kristol (CFR), considered the godfather of
neo-conservatism which promotes the ideas of Max Shachtman and Leo Strauss,
a noted Zionist and professor of political science at the University of
Chicago. Kristols co-founder was Robert W. Kagan (CFR).
Kristol is also the editor and co-founder, along
with John Podhoretz, of the Weekly Standard Magazine,
established September 17, 1995 and owned by Rupert Murdoch until August
2009.
This conservative magazine is edited by
William Kristol and Fred Barnes and promotes Middle East warfare and
a huge military budget, a mentality that infects the most popular
conservative talk show radio hosts.
Kristol is a trustee for the Manhattan Institute
which was founded by CIA Director William Casey and was staffed with former
CIA officers.
The Vulcans had almost limitless financing from a cache known by several
names,
-
the
Black Eagle Trust
-
the Marcos gold
-
Yamashitas Gold
-
the Golden Lily Treasure
-
the Durham Trust
Japan, under Emperor Hirohito, appointed a
brother,
Prince Chichibu, to head Golden Lily,
established in November 1937 before Japans infamous Rape of Nanking, to
accompany and follow the military.
The Golden Lily operation carried out massive
plunder throughout Asia and included an army of jewelers, financial experts
and smelters. [6]
While the Nazis also engaged in plundering the
countries they invaded, they were not as organized and methodical as the
Japanese. After the Allied blockade, Golden Lily headquarters were moved
from Singapore to Manila where 175 storage sites were built by slave
laborers and POWs.
Billions of dollars worth of gold and other
plundered treasures were stockpiled in these underground caverns, some of
which were discovered by the notorious Cold Warrior, Edward G. Lansdale
who directed the recovery of some of the vaults. Truman and subsequent
presidents, without congressional knowledge, have used those resources to
finance the CIAs chaotic clandestine activities throughout the world.
Much of the Middle East chaos is financed by
those pillaged funds. A tiny portion of that treasure was the source of
Ferdinand Marcos vast wealth. Marcos worked with the CIA for decades using
Golden Lily funds to bribe nations to support the Vietnam War. In return,
Marcos was allowed to sell over $1 trillion in gold through Australian
brokers. [7]
In July 1944, the leaders of forty-four nations met at Bretton Woods, New
Hampshire to plan the post-war economy and to discuss organizing a global
political action fund which would use the Black Eagle Trust ostensibly to
fight communism, bribe political leaders, enhance the treasuries of U.S.
allies, and manipulate elections in foreign countries and other
unconstitutional covert operations.
Certainly, those politicos who managed the funds
also received financial benefits.
This trust was headed by Secretary of War
Henry Stimson, assisted by,
-
John J. McCloy (later head of the World
Bank)
-
Robert Lovett (later Secretary of
Defense)
-
consultant Robert B. Anderson (later
Secretary of the Treasury) [8]
Anderson later operated the Commercial Exchange
Bank of Anguilla in the British West Indies and was convicted of running
illegal offshore banking operations and tax evasion.
Investors lost about $4.4 million. Consequently,
he was sent to prison for a token amount of time, one month.
He was also under house arrest for five years.
He could have received a ten-year sentence but Judge Palmieri considered
Andersons distinguished service to the country in the top levels of
Government. [9]
Between 1945 and 1947 huge quantities of gold and platinum were deposited in
prominent banks throughout the world.
These deposits came to be known as the Black Eagle Trust. Swiss
banks, because of their neutrality, were pivotal in maintaining these funds.
These funds were allocated to fighting communism and paying bribes and
fixing elections in places like Italy, Greece, and Japan. [10]
Stimson and McCloy, both retired from government
service, continued their involvement in the management of the Black Eagle
Trust. Robert B. Anderson, who toured the treasure sites with Douglas
MacArthur, set up the Black Eagle Trust and later became a member of
Eisenhowers cabinet. [11]
In order to maintain secrecy about the Trust,
Washington officials insisted that the Japanese did not plunder the
countries they invaded. Japanese officials who wanted to divulge the facts
were imprisoned or murdered in a way that made it look like suicide, a
common CIA tactic. [12]
The Germans paid reparations to thousands of
victims while the Japanese paid next to nothing.
Military leaders who opposed foreign policies
that embraced exploitation of third world countries were suicided or
died from mysterious causes, which includes individuals such as,
-
George S. Patton
-
Smedley D. Butler
-
James V. Forrestal
The Vulcans effort to crush Communism and end
the Cold War was largely funded by that Japanese plunder.
The Vulcans were resurrected when George W. Bush was installed as president
in 2000, facilitated by election maneuvers, probably lots of payoffs, and
Jeb Bushs purge of Florida voters.
They conducted other illegal operations, like
securities fraud and money laundering.
This entailed murder and false imprisonment to
prevent penitent participants from divulging the activities of the group.
During the process of accomplishing the main objective of destroying the
Soviet Union, the operatives made massive profits.
In September 1991, George H. W. Bush and Alan Greenspan, both
Pilgrims Society members, financed $240
billion in illegal bonds to economically decimate the Soviet Union and bring
Soviet oil and gas resources under the control of Western investors, backed
by the Black Eagle Trust and supported later by Putin who for the
right price purged certain oligarchs.
The $240 billion in illegal bonds were apparently replaced with Treasury
notes backed by U.S. taxpayers. [13]
To conceal the clearance of $240 billion in
securities,
the Federal Reserve, within two months,
increased the money supply to pre-9/11 numbers which resulted in the
American taxpayer refinancing the $240 billion. [14]
The Takeover of
Russias Oil Industry
BP Amoco became the largest foreign direct investor in Russia in 1997 when
it paid a half-billion dollars to buy a 10 percent stake in the Russian oil
conglomerate Sidanko.
Then in 1999, Tyumen Oil bought Sidankos prize
unit, Chernogorneft which allegedly made BP Amocos investment worthless.
Tyumen offered to cooperate with BP Amoco on the development of
Chernogorneft but BP Amoco was not interested. [15]
In October 1998, Halliburton Energy Services
had entered into an agreement with Moscow-based Tyumen Oil Company (TNK).
Their efforts were focused on the four western Siberia fields, the first one
being the Samotlorskoye field. [16]
TNK has proven oil reserves of 4.3 billion
barrels and possibly as many as 6.1 billion barrels, with crude oil
production and refining capabilities of 420,000 barrels/day and 230,000
barrels/day, respectively. TNK markets gasoline through 400 retail outlets.
[17]
In 2002 Halliburton and Sibneft, Russias fifth
largest crude oil producer, signed an agreement. Sibneft will use
Halliburtons new technologies to improve well construction and processing
while Halliburton directs all project management. [18]
Tyumenskaya Neftyanaya Kompaniya (Tyumen Oil Company) was established
in 1995 by government decree.
It is now TNK-BP, the leading Russian oil
company and ranks among the top ten privately owned oil companies worldwide
in terms of crude oil production. The company, formed in 2003, resulted from
the merger of BPs Russian oil and gas assets and the oil and gas assets of
Alfa, Access/Renova group (AAR). BP and AAR each own fifty percent of TNK-BP.
The shareholders of TNK-BP own almost fifty
percent of Slavneft, a vertically integrated Russian oil company. [19]
This transaction was the biggest in Russian
corporate history and was managed by Vladimir Lechtman, the Moscow
partner for Jones Day, a global law firm with thirty offices and 2,200
lawyers worldwide. TNK-BP, Russias second-largest oil company employs
almost 100,000 people and operates in Samotlor. [20]
Putin was financially rewarded by the collaborators and was happy to purge
some annoying industrialists who stood in the way.
Mikhail Khodorkovsky was the manager of Yukos, the company that he
built into Russias second-largest oil company after acquiring it for $168
million when his Bank MENATEP, the first privately owned but notoriously
corrupt bank since 1917 and wiped out in August 1998, purchased it through a
controversial government privatization auction in 1995. MENATEP was named as
a defendant in the Avisma lawsuit which was filed on August 19, 1999.
[21]
The bank may have facilitated the large-scale
theft of Soviet Treasury funds before and following the USSRs collapse in
1991. [22]
His company had borrowed hundreds of millions of
dollars from western banks. [23] He was arrested on October 25,
2003 and sentenced in June 2005 to eight years on fraud and tax evasion
charges. He was allegedly targeted as a political enemy by President
Vladimir Putin who went after other big business owners who apparently
made money by acquiring states assets.
Yukos was sold piecemeal to pay off $28 billion
in back tax charges. Yukos was seized and given to Rosneft. [24]
When Khodorkovsky was arrested, his secretive business arrangement with
the Rothschild family was exposed as Jacob
Rothschild assumed Khodorkovskys 26% control of Yukos while Khodorkovskys
directorial seat on the Yukos board went to Edgar Ortiz, a former
Halliburton vice president during Dick Cheneys reign as CEO at
Halliburton.
Cheney, as President and CEO of Halliburton,
automatically had an association with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan
Republic (SOCAR). [25] In November 1997, Dick Cheney, in
anticipation of imminent events, had appointed Edgar Ortiz as president of
Halliburton Energy Services, their global division. [26]
The Yukos Oil Company merged with the smaller Sibneft Oil Company on October
3, 2003 which created Russias largest oil and gas business and the worlds
fourth-largest private oil company. [27]
On May 11, 2007 Halliburton announced they had
made an agreement with the Tyumen State Oil and Gas University to open a new
employee-training center in Russia to grow their business in that country
and in the surrounding region.
They are currently training students from five
countries,
-
Kazakhstan
-
the Netherlands
-
Norway
-
Russia
-
the United Kingdom [28]
Halliburton was awarded a $33 million contract
by TNK-BP to provide oil field services to develop the Ust-Vakh field in
Western Siberia. [29]
September 11 - Black
Op Cover-up
Three top securities brokers had offices in the World Trade Center,
-
Cantor Fitzgerald
-
Euro Brokers
-
Garbon Inter Capital
Flight 11 struck just under the floors where
Cantor Fitzgerald was located.
Cantor Fitzgerald, with possible connections to
the U.S. Intelligence apparatus, was Americas biggest securities broker and
apparently the main target. Within minutes, an explosion in the North
Towers vacant 23rd floor, right under the offices of the FBI and
Garbon Inter Capital on the 25th floor caused a huge fire from
the 22nd through the 25th floors.
At the same time, there was an explosion in the
basement of the North Tower. [30]
A vault in the North Tower basement held less than $1 billion in gold, much
of which was reportedly moved before 9/11. However, the government
had hundreds of billions of dollars of securities which were summarily
destroyed.
The Federal Reserve, untouched by the crisis at its downtown offices (as
they had everything backed up to a remote location), assumed emergency
powers that afternoon. The $240 billion in securities were electronically
cleared. [31] Then, at 9:03, Flight 175 slammed into the 78th
floor of the South Tower just below the 84th floor where Euro
Brokers were located. [32]
Brian Clark, the manager at Euro Brokers,
heard numerous explosions, apparently unrelated to what he referred to as
the oxygen-starved fire caused by the plane crash.
The
September 11 attacks related to the financial improprieties
during the preceding ten years which spurred at least nine federal
investigations which were initiated in 1997-1998, about the same time that
Osama bin Laden, after twenty years as a CIA asset, announced a fatwa
against the U.S.
The records of many of those investigations were
held in the Buildings Six and Seven and on the 23rd floor of the
North Tower. Those investigations were sure to reveal the Black Eagle Trust
shenanigans. [33]
Building Seven, not hit by a plane,
collapsed at 5:20:33 p.m. but was vacated as early as 9:00 a.m. when
evacuees claimed to see dead bodies and sporadic fires within the building.
By 2008 and even earlier the covert securities were worth trillions.
The securities used to decimate the Soviets and end the Cold War were stored
in certain brokers vaults in the World Trade Center where they were
destroyed on September 11, 2001. They would have come due for settlement and
clearing on September 12, 2001. [34]
The federal agency investigating these bonds,
the Office of Naval Intelligence was in the section of the Pentagon that was
destroyed on September 11. Renovations at the Pentagon were due to be
completed on September 16, 2001. However, the Office of Naval
Intelligence (ONI), the entity that often monitors war games, was
hurriedly moved.
If they were monitoring the simultaneous war
games that morning, they would have realized that the games were used as a
distraction from the actual assault.
Whatever hit the Pentagon, struck the
Navy Command Center and the offices of the Chief of Naval Operations
Intelligence Plot (CNO-IP). [35]
There were 125 fatalities in the Pentagon;
thirty-one percent of them were people who worked in the Naval Command
Center, the location of the Office of Naval Intelligence.
Thirty-nine of the forty people who worked in
the Office of Naval Intelligence died. [36]
On September 10, 2001 Rumsfeld announced that the Pentagon couldnt account
for $2.3 trillion,
We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor
chain. Our financial systems are decades old. According to some
estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot
share information from floor to floor in this building because its
stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or
incompatible. [37]
It was forgotten the following morning.
Accountants, bookkeepers and budget analysts who
were in the section of the Pentagon being renovated met their unexpected
deaths.
The destruction of accounting facts and figures
will prevent discovery of where that money went. I am quite certain someone
knows where it is. Certainly this is not merely gross incompetence but
private seizure of public funds. [38]
At the time Rabbi
Dov Zakheim was chief-financial officer
for the Department of Defense. [39]
In 1993, Zakheim worked for SPS International,
part of System Planning Corporation, a defense contractor. His firms
subsidiary, Tridata Corporation directed the investigation of the first
terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 1993. [40]
Certain National Security officials who had
participated in the Cold War victory in 1991 thus comprised the collateral
damage of the Cold War.
They, along with hundreds of innocent people were in the World Trade Center
towers and the Pentagon. Their deaths were presumably required to conceal
the existence of the Black Eagle Trust, along with the numerous illegal
activities it had funded for over 50 years. This massive destruction, and
the lost lives, constitutes a massive cover-up and continued lawlessness by
the brotherhood of death,
Skull and Bones, and their accomplices, the
Enterprise. [41]
The Enterprise was established in the 1980s as a
covert fascist Cold Warriors faction working with other groups like
Halliburtons private security forces and the Moonies.
Citibank is connected to the Enterprise, along
with all the CIA front banks, Nugen Hand and BCCI.
Double Dipping
Alvin B. Buzzy Krongard was elected Chief Executive
Officer of Alexander Brown and Sons in 1991 and Chairman of the Board in
1994.
Bankers Trust purchased Alexander Brown and Sons
in 1997 to form BT Alex Brown. Krongard relinquished his investments in Alex
Brown to Bankers Trust as part of the merger.
He became Vice Chairman of Bankers Trust where
he personally interacted with wealthy clients who were intimately linked to
drug money laundering. After a year of possible networking, Krongard joined
(or as Michael Ruppert suggests, rejoined) the CIA in 1998 where his friend,
Director George Tenet, concentrated his skills on private banking
ventures within the elite moneyed community.
Senate investigations verify that private
banking firms frequently engage in money laundering from illicit drugs and
corporate crime operations. [42]
On January 28, 2000 the Reginald Howe and GATA
Lawsuit was filed which accused certain U.S. bullion banks of illegally
dumping U.S. Treasury gold on the market. The lawsuit named Deutsche Bank
Alex Brown, the U.S. Treasury, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve, and
Citibank, Chase, as defendants.
Gerald Corrigan was accused of having
private knowledge of the scheme. [43]
Krongard became the Executive Director of the
CIA, essentially the Chief Operating Officer, and the number three man on
March 16, 2001. Krongard, while at the CIA, arranged for
Blackwaters Erik Prince to get his first contract with the U.S.
government, and later joined its board.
Richard Wagner, a data retrieval expert, estimated that more than $100
million in illegal transactions appeared to have rushed through the WTC
computers before and during the disaster on September 11, 2001.
A Deutsche Bank employee verified that approximately five minutes before the
first plane hit the tower that the Deutsche Bank computer system in their
WTC office was seized by an outside, unknown entity. Every single file was
swiftly uploaded to an unidentified locality. This employee escaped from the
building, but lost many of his friends. He knew, from his position in the
company, that Alex Brown, the Deutsche Bank subsidiary participated in
insider trading.
Senator Carl Levin claimed that Alex Brown was just one of twenty
prominent U.S. banks associated with money laundering. [44]
Andreas von Bülow, a Social Democratic Party member of the German
parliament (1969-1994), was on the parliamentary committee on intelligence
services, a group that has access to classified information. Von Bülow was
also a member of the Schalck-Golodkowski investigation committee which
investigates white-collar crime. He has estimated that inside trader profits
surrounding 9/11 totaled approximately $15 billion.
Von Bülow told The Daily Telegraph,
If what I say is right, the whole US
government should end up behind bars.
Further, he said,
They have hidden behind a veil of secrecy
and destroyed the evidence
they invented the story of 19 Muslims
working within Osama bin Ladens al Qaeda in order to hide the truth of
their own covert operation.
He also said,
Im convinced that the US apparatus must
have played a role and my theory is backed up by the [Washington]
governments refusal to present any proof whatsoever of what happened.
[45]
On September 26, CBS reported that the amount
was more than $100 million and that seven countries were investigating the
irregular trades.
Two newspapers, Reuters and the New York Times,
and other mainstream media reported that the CIA regularly monitors
extraordinary trades and economic irregularities to ascertain possible
criminal activities or financial assaults.
In fact, the CIA uses specialized software,
PROMIS, to scrutinize trades. [46]
Numerous researchers believe, with justification, that the transactions in
the financial markets are indicative of foreknowledge of the events of 9/11,
the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. One of the trades, for $2.5
million, a pittance compared to the total, went unclaimed. Alex Brown, once
managed by Krongard, was the firm that placed the put options on United
Airlines stock.
President Bush awarded Krongard by appointing him as CIA Executive Director
in 2004. [47]
Between September 6 and 7, 2001, the Chicago Board Options Exchange received
purchases of 4,744 put options on United Airlines and only 396 call options.
If 4,000 of those options were purchased by people with foreknowledge, they
would have accrued about $5 million. On September 10, the Chicago exchange
received 4,516 put options on American Airlines compared to 748 calls. The
implications are that some insiders might profit by about $4 million.
These two incidents were wholly irregular and at
least six times higher than normal. [48]
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, who occupied floors 43-46, 56, 59-74
of the World Trade Center, Tower 2, saw 2,157 of its October $45 put options
bought in the three trading days before Black Tuesday. This compares to an average of 27 contracts per
day before September 6.
Morgan Stanleys share price fell from $48.90 to
$42.50 in the aftermath of the attacks. Assuming that 2,000 of these options
contracts were bought based upon knowledge of the approaching attacks, their
purchasers could have profited by at least $1.2 million.
The U.S. government never again mentioned the trade irregularities after
October 12, 2001. [49]
Catastrophic events serve two purposes for the
top criminal element in society - the perpetrators seize resources while
their legislative accomplices impose burdensome restrictions on the citizens
to make them more submissive and silent.
