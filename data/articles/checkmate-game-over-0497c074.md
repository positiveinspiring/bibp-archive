Financial analyst Dr.
Jim Willie says forget about the
government shutdown and the debt ceiling. The Treasury market is the big
problem.
Dr. Willie says,
"Whats going on with the Treasury bond
market right now is systems are breaking... they broke the interest rate
swaps. They are not functioning anymore... Foreigners are dumping
Treasuries."
The cost of insuring one-year U.S. bonds against
default has quintupled since Sept. 23, according to data from Markit, a
financial information company.
Translation:
the Federal Reserve, the United States
government and New Yorks biggest banks are boxed into a corner with a
horde of financial vipers closing in on every side. What this means is
that no matter what the congress and Obama decide its "game over".
The problem is that everyone is going to join in
on a selling spree of worthless paper only to find out that the paper is
indeed worthless.
Who is going to buy the bonds that are now being
dumped? Its only paper backed by the good faith of the United States, which
unfortunately has not acted in good faith when in league with corrupt
activities on Wall Street, which Washington made legal - a total betrayal of
not only American people but also the peoples of the entire globe.
What happens to the value of something when
there are no buyers and only sellers?
Dr. Willie speculates about the meeting last
week of all the big bankers at the White House saying,
"I think it was an emergency meeting because
they cannot successfully defend the
dollar anymore, not fend off the big Treasury bond sales.
Reversal in the Treasury bond market could be a deathblow for these
zombie New York banks.
These big banks are in danger of imploding.
I do not think the Fed is going to taper its bond buying.
I believe they are going to double it."
A U.S. government default will be an economic
calamity like none the world has ever seen.
Failure by the worlds largest borrower to pay
its debt - unprecedented in modern history - will devastate stock markets
from Brazil to Zurich,
halt a $5 trillion lending mechanism for
investors who rely on Treasuries, blow up borrowing costs for billions of
people and companies, ravage the dollar and throw the U.S. and world
economies into a recession that probably would become a depression.
U.S. budgetary uncertainty is breeding a cloud
of fear over global financial markets, the damage of increased risk to
markets is already being sown.
In such a climate of uncertainty, the
psychological maelstrom of fear can build to create a herd-like response
with everyone running for the exits at once.
"If they seriously default on the debt, what
were really talking about is a depression," says veteran financial
sector analyst Richard Bove, VP of research at Rafferty Capital Markets.
In a news video, he explains how the fallout
would be a lot worse than the recession suffered in 2008 and the aftershocks
would be felt for at least a decade.
The
U.S. Treasury Department itself is worried
reporting,
"A default would be unprecedented and has
the potential to be catastrophic: credit markets could freeze, the value
of the dollar could plummet, U.S. interest rates could skyrocket, the
negative spillovers could reverberate around the world, and there might
be a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008
or worse."
Pathetic to have had to listen to the Federal
Reserve hint about tapering when they have been under accelerating pressure
to buy more because they are the only one left to buy the debt and fund
(with funny money created out of thin air) the insane American budget.
It is guns or butter after all (basic economics)
meaning the United States just cannot afford all its aircraft carriers. The
generals have miscalculated building a military establishment that the
country nor the world can afford.
Already the situation is morphing quickly with
market mechanisms threatening seizure. We keep hearing about the
vulnerabilities of the Repo market and all markets dependent on the American
dollar and specifically on the value of 10 year. treasury notes for value,
all could be ripped asunder from one day to the next.
The winds have changed. Owners of United States
treasury bonds are not feeling secure holding mountains of paper that are
being threatened with a dramatic loss of value.
A
plunge in Treasuries would also devalue the
dollar, which would instantly make everything we buy more expensive, and in
turn destabilize countries and economies all over the world.
Political Rebellion
In America we see a potential rebellion taking
place in the Republican Party, which could itself splinter in half if the
most conservative elements are not heard. But lets assume the best case
scenario. Next week they raise the debt limit.
Then what?
The same thing is going to happen but perhaps a
few weeks or months later! The inevitable has arrived. If they pass the bill
to raise the ceiling who then is going to buy the bonds to pay for continued
bloated spending? Investors and sovereign governments are selling bonds and
then the Treasury will begin selling bonds if the ceiling is raised.
Who is going to buy them?
When the Fed stands naked in full light seen for
what it is and for what it now has to do there will be hell to pay. They
have not invented the movie script to describe what will happen to the
worlds civilization when the dollar collapses.
The American and entire first world and third
world with it will be faced with a depression or outright collapse when
nothing will work because currencies and banks will fail along with
everything else.
"Now youve got not only the budget but the
debt ceiling and time is running out and everybody knows it, including
(the politicians)," said
Terry Morris, senior vice president and
senior equity manager for National Penn Investors Trust Company in
Reading, Pennsylvania.
"The longer this goes on, the more the
uncertainty, the closer the deadline and the more nervous investors are
going to be."
Conclusion
You can forget about any default in the
debt-ceiling crisis.
Former Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr.
Paul Craig Roberts says,
"The debt ceiling will be raised. No
government wants to lose its power or lose its ability to borrow. So,
if they dont raise the debt ceiling, it is just a way of Washington
committing hari-kari. It simply removes the United States as a super
power."
Dr. Roberts goes on to say,
"If they dont make a deal, one of two
things will happen... The Federal Reserve, on its own authority, lends
the Treasury the money... The other alternative, Obama... can simply
declare a national emergency and raise the debt ceiling on his own
initiative. He could govern as a dictator."
What would happen if the U.S. did default? Dr.
Roberts says,
"The danger of default is the rest of the
world dumps dollars. If they dump dollars, the Fed loses control, the
whole system blows up. The banks fail. The bond market collapses. The
stock market wont go down 1,500 points; it would be cut in half. "
No matter what happens, there is still an
enormous and growing debt.
Dr. Roberts contends,
"The situation is unsustainable."
It will blow up at some point, and Dr. Roberts
predicts,
"It will be worse than the Great Depression
because in the Great Depression, prices fell along with employment.
Now, prices will be rising and employment would be falling... Gold and
silver prices will explode in dollar terms."
