National Security is a euphamism for keeping the people ignorant
so that the elites will earn billions of dollars because they are ignorant.
There are some people who feel that the people need not know information
or that they should not know certain information. Clearly, this is so they
can persue their own agenda. This is not proper in a democracy and is proof
that democracy does not currently exist.
Psychological and psychotronic warfare is the means by which people are
influenced for ulterior reasons. The term psychotronic is an adjective which
is defined as an effect on the interface between mind, matter, and/or spirit.
The term was coined in the late 1960s in France. The first conference on
it was held in Prague, Czech Republic in 1972.
Any kind of warfare is not conducive toward peace so let's abolish this.
