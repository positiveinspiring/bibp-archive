When it comes to firmly established,
currency-for-commodity, self reinforcing systems in the past century of
human history, nothing comes close to the petrodollar:
it is safe to say that few things have
shaped the face of the modern world and defined the reserve currency as
much as the $2.3 trillion/year energy exports denominated exclusively in
US dollars (although
recent confirmations of previously inconceivable exclusions such as
Turkey's oil-for-gold trade with Iran are increasingly putting the
petrodollar status quo under the microscope).
But that is the past, and with rapid changes in
modern technology and extraction efficiency, leading to such offshoots are
renewable and shale, the days of the petrodollar "as defined" may be over.
So what new trade regime may be the dominant one
for the next several decades?
According to some, for now mostly overheard
whispering in the hallways, the primary commodity imbalance that will shape
the face of global trade in the coming years is not that of energy, but
that of food, driven by constantly rising food prices due to a
fragmented supply-side unable to catch up with increasing demand, one in
which China will play a dominant role but not due to its commodity
extraction and/or processing supremacy, but the contrary:
due to its soaring deficit for agricultural
products, and in which such legacy trade deficit culprits as the US will
suddenly enjoy a huge advantage in both trade and geopolitical terms.
Coming soon: the agri-dollar.
But first, some perspectives from Karim Bitar
on CEO of Genus, on what is sure to be the biggest marginal player of the
agri-dollar revolution, China, whose attempt to redefine itself as a
consumption-driven superpower will fail epically and very violently,
unless it is able to find a way to feed its massive, rising middle class in
a cheap and efficient manner.
But before that even, take note of the following
chart which takes all you know about global trade surplus and deficit when
narrowed down to what may soon be that all important agricultural (hence
food) category, and flips it around on its head.
Karim
Bitar on China:
Structurally, China is at a huge
disadvantage as it accounts for 20% of the worlds population, but only
7% of arable land. Compare that with Brazil which has the reverse of
those ratios. What that does for a country like China is to incentivise
the adoption of technification.
Lets look at their porcine market, which
represents 50% of global production and consumption. In China, to
slaughter roughly 600 mn pigs per year, which is about six times the
demand in the US, they have a breeding herd of about 50 mn animals. In
the US, the comparable number is only about 6 mn so there is a huge
productivity lag.
Owing to its structural disadvantages, China
is much more focused on increasing efficiency. For that, it needs to
accelerate technification.
So, were seeing a whole series of
government incentives at a national level, a provincial level and a
local level, focusing on the need to move toward integrated pork
production because thats a key way to optimize total economics, both in
terms of pig production, slaughtering, processing and also actually
taking the pork out into the marketplace.
The Chinese government is important as a
customer to us because of its clarity of vision on food security. It has
seen the Arab Spring, and it is cognizant of the strong socio-political
implications of higher food prices. Pork prices could account for about
25% of the CPI, so it knows it can be a major issue. Its because of all
these pressures, that China is more focused on responding to the food
challenge.
Its a sort of a burning platform there.
...Take milk production in China and India.
China is basically trying to leapfrog and avoid small-scale farming by
adopting a US model. In the US, you tend to have very large herds.
Today about 30% of US milk production is
from herds of 2,000 plus, and we expect that to reach 60% within the
next five years. Today in China, there are already several hundred dairy
herds of over 1,000. However in India, therell be less than 50. The
average dairy herd size is closer to five, so its very fragmented.
So the reality is that a place like China,
because of government policies, subsidies and a much more demanding
focused approach to becoming self-sufficient, has a much greater ability
to respond to a supply challenge rapidly.
The problem for China, and to a lesser extent
India, however one defines it, is that it will need increasingly more food,
processed with ever greater efficiency for the current conservative regime
to be able to preserve the status quo, all else equal.
And for a suddenly very food trade
deficit-vulnerable China, it means that the biggest winners may be Brazil,
the US and Canada. Oh and Africa. The only question is how China will adapt
in a new world in which it finds itself in an odd position: a competitive
trade disadvantage, especially its primary nemesis: the USA.
So for those curious how a world may look
like under "the Agri-dollar," read on for some timely views
from GS'
Hugo Scott-Gall.
Meaty problems,
simmering solutions
What potential impacts could a further
re-pricing of food have on the world? Why might food re-price?
Because demand is set to rise faster than supply
can respond. The forces pushing demand higher are well known, population
growth, urbanization and changing middle class size and tastes. In terms of
economic evolution, the food price surge comes after the energy price surge,
as industrialization segues into consumption growth (high-income countries
consume about 30% more calories than low income nations, but the difference
in value is about eight times).
Here, we are keenly interested in how the supply
side can respond, both in terms of where and how solutions are found, and
who is supplying them.
We are drawn towards an analogy with the energy
industry here:
the energy industry has invested heavily in
efficiency, and through innovation, clusters of excellence, and access
to capital has created solutions, the most obvious of which are
renewable energy and shale.
The key question for us is, can and will
something similar happen in food?
Its hard to argue that the ingredients that
sparked energys supply-side response are all present in the food supply
chain. In food, theres huge fragmentation, a lack of coordination,
shortages of capital in support industries (infrastructure) and only
pockets of isolated innovation. We suspect that the supply-side response may
well remain uncoordinated and slower than in other industries.
But things are changing. Those who disagree with
Thomas Malthus will always back human ingenuity.
As well as looking at where the innovators in
the supply chain are (from page 10), and where there are sustainably high
returns through IP (e.g., seeds, enzymes etc.), we need to think about the
macro and micro economic impacts of higher food prices, and soberingly, the
geo-political ones.
Slimming down
Could the demand destruction that higher energy
prices have precipitated occur in food?
There are some important differences between the
two that make resolving food imbalances tougher. Food consumption is very
fragmented and there is less scope for substitution.
Changing eating habits is much harder than
changing the fuel burnt for power.
And, ultimately, food spend is less
discretionary that energy, i.e., the scope for efficient consumption is more
limited and consumers will not (and cannot) voluntarily delay consumption,
let alone structurally reduce it.
This means that higher food prices, especially
in economies where food is a greater portion of household spending, will
lead to either lower consumption of discretionary items or a reduced ability
to service debt (with consequent effects on asset prices). When oil prices
spiked in the late 1970s, US consumers spent c.9% of their income on energy
vs. an average of 7% over the previous decade.
And yet, the total savings rate rose by c.2% as
they overcompensated on spending cuts on other items. 2007-09 saw a similar
phenomenon too.
Even the most cursory browse through history
shows that high food costs can act as a political tinderbox (so too high
youth unemployment), and we believe there is a degree of overconfidence with
regard to the economic impact of food prices in the West: food costs
relative to incomes may look manageable, but when there is no buffer (i.e.,
a minimal savings rate) then there are problems.
Food spend as a percentage of total household
consumption expenditure is a relatively benign 14% in the US, versus c.20%
for most major European nations and Japan. This rises to c.40% for China and
45% for India. Of course, as wages rise, the proportion of food within total
consumption expenditure falls, but that is only after consumption hits a
ceiling.
Currently, India and China consume about 2,300
and 2,900 calories per capita per day, compared to a DM average of about
3,400. If the two countries eat like the West, then food production must
rise by 12%.
And if the rest of the world catches up to these
levels then that number is north of 50%.
The scramble for
Africas eggs
In terms of ownership of resources, food, like
energy, can be broken into haves and have-nots.
While there are countries that have been
successful without resources, it is quite clear that inheriting advantages
(in this case good soil, climate and water) makes life easier. But that, of
course, is only half the battle; what is also required is organization,
capital, education and collaboration to make it happen.
Take Africa. It has 60% of the worlds
uncultivated land, enviable demographics and lots of water (though not
evenly distributed). Basic infrastructure, consolidation of agricultural
land and minimal use of fertilizers and crop protection could do wonders for
agricultural output in the region. But thats easier said than done.
Several African economies also need better
access to information, education, property rights and access to markets and
capital.
Put another way, it needs better institutions. If Africa does
deliver over the coming decades, rising food prices will alter the economics
of investing in the region. The next scramble for Africa should be about
food (while it is about hard commodities now and in the late 19th century it
was about empire size).
Fertilizer consumption has a diminishing
incremental impact on yields, but Africa (along with several developing
economies elsewhere) is far from touching that ceiling. Currently, Africa
accounts for just 3% of global agricultural trade, with South Africa and
Côte d'Ivoire together accounting for a third of the entire continents
exports.
But if the world wants to feed itself then it
needs Africa to emerge as an agricultural powerhouse.
Higher up the production curve is China, which
has been industrializing its agriculture as it seeks to move towards self
sufficiency.
Power consumed by agricultural machinery has
almost doubled over the last decade, while the number of tractors per
household has tripled, driving per hectare output up by an average of more
than 20% over the same period.
Even so, in just the last 10 years China has
gone from surplus to deficit in several meat, vegetable and cereal
categories. So a lot more needs to be done, and a shortage of water could
also prove to be an impediment, especially in some of its remote areas.
The power of the pampas
With significant surpluses in soybeans, maize,
meat and oilseeds, Brazil and Argentina have led the Latin
American continent in terms of food trade.
Current surpluses are 6x and 3x 2000 levels,
versus only a 30% increase in the previous decade, and are rising. A key
impediment to boosting exports is infrastructure. Food has to travel a long
way just to reach the port, and then further still to reach other markets.
Forty days is possibly acceptable for iron ore
to reach China on a ship from Brazil, but that would prevent several
perishable food items from being exported.
And hence, solution providers in terms of
durability, packaging, refrigeration and processing will be in demand. Also,
while you could attribute a lot of the agricultural success of LatAm
economies to good conditions, they have also benefitted from the adoption of
agricultural innovation.
For instance, more than a third of crops planted
in the region are as seeds that are
genetically modified, versus more than 45%
in the US and about 12% in Asia.
Genetically modified crops are not new. They
provide solutions to some of the most frequent constraints on
agricultural yields (resistance to environmental challenges including
drought and more efficient absorption of soil nutrients, fertilizers and
water) or add value by enhancing nutrient composition or the shelf life of
the crop.
And while the adoption of GM crops and seeds is
far from wholehearted, particularly in Europe, its most certainly a key
part of the 'solution' in economies that are set to face a more
severe food shortage.
The last mango in Paris?
Europes deficit/surplus makes for interesting
reading. Seventeen of the 27 EU countries face a food trade deficit, and
yet, the EU overall recorded a surplus (barely) in 2010 for only the second
time in the last 50 years (see chart).
Broken down further, the UK is the largest food
importer, followed by Germany and Italy, while the Netherlands and France
lead exports thanks to their very large processing industries.
If Europes future is one of relative economic
decline, then reduced purchasing power when bidding for scarce food
resources is an unappetizing prospect.
Therefore, it needs all the innovative solutions
it can muster, or import substitution will have to increase. Its important
to note that being in overall surplus or deficit can mask variety at the
category level, i.e., Europe is a net importer of beef, fruit & vegetables,
and corn, while its exports are helped by alcohol and wine specifically.
Japan, in particular, is very challenged. It is
the only country in the preceding table to show a deficit in every single
food category.
We conclude our trip around the world in North
America. Large-scale production, access to markets, a home to innovation and
favorable regulation has meant that the US (and Canada) continues to
dominate some of the key agricultural resources such as soybeans, corn,
fodder, wheat and oilseeds.
Put this self sufficiency together with the
medium-term potential for energy self sufficiency and relatively good
demographics (better than China), and a rosier prognosis for the US, versus
the rest of the Western world and parts of Asia, begins to fall into place.
Agri-dollars
on the rise
Before we conclude, we need to devote a few
lines to the geo-political and macro economic consequences of higher food
prices.
Its likely that countries will act increasingly
strategically to secure food supply, and that protections (e.g., high export
tariffs) may well rise. It is also likely that there are special bi-lateral
deals to access stable and secure food supply.
This could obviously damage the integrity of the
WTO-sponsored system. Another consequence might be the emergence of agri-dollars,
in the same way that petro-dollars emerged in the 1970s. This may seem far
fetched (the value of the worlds energy exports is US$2.3 tn compared to
US$1.08 tn for agriculture) but its important to think through the
consequences.
The big exporters, especially those with the
scope to grow their output, may well have sustainable surpluses that can be
reinvested into their economies (or extracted by a narrow part of society).
Similarly, the consequence of being a net
importer will be an effective tax on consumption: disposable income in the
US would jump if oil was US$25/bbl.
As we have said, we would expect the big gainers
of a meaningful rise in food prices in real terms to be Brazil, the US and
Canada, while Japan, South Korea and the UK would face challenges.
The top chart is important: look how Chinas
surplus has turned to deficit. What will happen if the Chinese middle class
swells as it is expected to? And thats the rub; what we have been used to
in terms of foods importance is set to change.
How food moves around the world is likely to
change, and the flow of currency around the world will also likely be
impacted.
