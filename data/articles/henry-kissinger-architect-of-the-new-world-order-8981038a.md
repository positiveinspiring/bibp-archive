For a huge variety of well justified reasons,
Dr.
Henry Kissinger is believed by millions to
be one of the single
most
evil individuals still living, or to have ever lived.
A Younger Henry Kissinger
Dr. Henry Kissinger - The
Original Dr. Evil.
The problem with considering Dr. Kissinger as
"evil" is that inside of each of us there is a little Dr. Kissinger that
lacked the nourishment to reach the heights of satanic fruition that Dr.
Kissinger has reached.
Literally, Kissinger is no better than Hitler, it is a great lack of
perspective that one must employee to envision Henry Kissinger as the more
moral man than Adolf Hitler.
The ideals of Dr. Kissinger are every bit as
lethal, but to different demographics of person.
Like his lieutenant and subordinate in the New World Order,
B.H. Obama,
Kissinger won the Nobel Peace prize - clear indication of an Orwellian world
controlled by oligarchy propaganda. Any sensible man now regards the Nobel
Prize for peace as the most hideous badge of murder - the mark of a satanic
revelry in intent of the gravest order for humanity.
Notions set forth by Dr. Kissinger include the
idea that the elderly are useless eaters - that is Nobel Prize "peace," and
Dr. Kissinger is now elderly, and he still eats.
"The elderly are useless eaters."
- Henry Kissinger
quoted in the
book The Final Days
"Military men are 'dumb, stupid animals to be used' as pawns for foreign
policy."
- Henry Kissinger
quoted in the
book The Final Days
"Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards
the third world, because the US economy will require large and
increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less
developed countries."
- Henry Kissinger
National
Security Memo 200, dated April 24, 1974
"Today Americans would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to
restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful. This is especially true
if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real
or promulgated, that threatened our very existence.
It is then that all
peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from
this evil.
The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented
with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for
the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world
government."
- Henry Kissinger
speaking at
Evian, France, May 21, 1992
Bilderberg meeting.
Unbeknownst to
Kissinger, his speech was taped by a Swiss delegate to the meeting.
"Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac."
- Henry Kissinger
quoted in the
book The Final Days
Now good sir, Dr. Kissinger, do you indeed have no honor? Sir?
Who can justify such things?
Oh I know for certain that the tongue is a two
edged sword - an instrument of division and sin, but OH DR. KISSINGER!
-
Surely you jest?
-
You'd have the elderly starve, Los
Angeles invaded after an orchestrated subversive plot, and enjoy the
thrill of it all?
-
How much more evil could the human heart
contain?
-
How much spite?
-
How much ignorance from one supposedly
so brilliant?
-
How much more a vacuum of empathy for
his fellows could a man who fought against Hitler have within him?
Try as I might, and try as I may - I can find no
justification for the hideous and immoral philosophy of Dr. Henry Kissinger,
but the saddest truth of all is that he's revered as a great man, a master
statesman, a philosopher, and a teacher!
-
How is any of this possible?
-
What worthy deed has Dr. Henry Kissinger
done for this world?
-
What worthy deed has he done at all save
his well performed duties in the European theatre of war during the
Allied invasion of the very land he escaped from?
-
Has he ever done anything for his
fellows?
Likely not - Henry Kissinger is the exact dumb
stupid beast, pawn of foreign policy that he decried that military men were
- all the while, himself a war veteran, irony knows no bounds, and neither
does the black heart of Henry Kissinger.
Let us take a look at the life of Dr. Henry Kissinger - master
architect of
the New World Order.
Young Henry Kissinger
Henry Kissinger (left) with Fritz Kraemer in 1945
Born as Heinz Alfred Kissinger in Bavaria, Germany in 1923 to a traditional
German Jewish family, Henry's father was a schoolteacher, and surely that
was a major part of him becoming a bit of an academic.
Kissinger wasn't the family's surname
originally, but had been adopted many years before, in 1817 by Henry's great
great grandmother. The Kissingers could see and feel the turbulent political
weather in Germany during the 1930s, and in 1938 they wisely moved to New
York City.
Henry adopted the culture of the USA readily and
quickly, but to hear Dr. Kissinger speak is to realize that he never lost
his Frankish German accent.
Do you see how clean cut our Dr. Kissinger is in the photo up above? Well,
when Henry got out of high school he promptly went to college, and he worked
part time in an old fashioned shave brush factory to help pay his bills.
Henry excelled academically and enjoyed working part time too.
At the City
College Of New York he studied accounting, but his studies were interrupted
when he was drafted into the army in 1943.
In the army the future Dr. Kissinger would meet another very talented German
immigrant named
Fritz Kraemer, and because both of them were very
fluent in German, their talents were in great demand.
Henry was no coward, he'd volunteered for
hazardous duty and got it during the Battle of The Bulge.
As the allied
forces advanced into the German heartland, Henry Kissinger brilliantly
arranged and organized German civilians, was promoted quickly to Sergeant,
and set to tracking down
Gestapo officers and other saboteurs, for his
efforts, he was awarded the Bronze Star.
Soon young Henry would take on more and more authority - helping to De
Nazify assigned districts of captured Western Germany.

The Dr. Henry
Kissinger
Following his very worthy and appreciated service in the second world war,
Henry Kissinger returned to the US and put his mind to books, he studied at
Harvard College, and in 1954 was awarded his PhD from Harvard University.
Henry would then remain with Harvard University
as a member of the faculty, and his primary manner of influence was in
government and international affairs. As an Ivy League staff, one has
tremendous sway with government, as universities such as Harvard are
practically part of the federal government of the USA.
Henry was on his way to becoming the ultimate
globalist philosopher - the kind of man that ultimately is an anti Patriot,
a hater of the rights and the culture of the nation that so easily and
lovingly adopted his family when they fled the Nazis.
Just like
George Soros betrayed the United Kingdom for billions,
Henry Kissinger would betray the citizens of the USA in favor of
the New
World Order.
Eager to influence US Foreign policy in such a manner as to
destroy the United States from within, Henry Kissinger would team up with
like minded anti American Americans such as Nelson Rockefeller, then
Governor of New York.
From the influence with the governor of one of
the nation's most populace and wealthy states, Kissinger would then leap
into the least credible or honest presidential administration in US history,
and Richard Nixon must have surely saw a kindred spirit in Henry - he made
him National Security Advisor in 1969.
Soon Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State, and
after Nixon was humiliated publicly, Henry Kissinger would remain as
Secretary of State under Gerald Ford.

Realpolitik With Henry
Kissinger
From 1969 to 1977 Henry Kissinger was perhaps
the single most dominant individual in United States foreign policy, and he
did orchestrate some nice maneuvers in regards to dealing with the gigantic
beasts of Soviet Russia and Communist China.
Henry had no part in starting the war in
Vietnam, but he did make grand efforts to end it, and for that he was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, despite his orchestrated cease fire being
largely ineffective - I suppose he could have had intentions that it were.
As National Security Advisor, in 1974 Kissinger directed
the much-debated
'National Security Study Memorandum 200' - and this is a document and/or plan
that was anything BUT peaceful.
If you study the no longer classified
document, you'll find the policies of Nobel "peace" prize winner Kissinger
anything but peaceful, but rather the more cold and deterministic towards
protecting the wealthy with their wealth, as the ultimate goal has always
been a global governance ran by the super wealthy oligarchs that Kissinger
admires so much.
Please note the keyword "exploitation" in the following:
"The U.S. economy will require large and
increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less
developed countries [see National Commission on Materials Policy,
Towards a National Materials Policy: Basic Data and Issues, April 1972].
That fact gives the U.S. enhanced interest
in the political, economic, and social stability of the supplying
countries.
Wherever a lessening of population pressures through reduced
birth rates can increase the prospects for such stability, population
policy becomes relevant to resource supplies and to the economic
interests of the United States...
The location of known reserves of higher
grade ores of most minerals favors increasing dependence of all
industrialized regions on imports from less developed countries.
The real problems of mineral supplies lie,
not in basic physical sufficiency, but in the politico-economic issues
of access, terms for exploration and exploitation, and division of the
benefits among producers, consumers, and host country governments"
[Chapter III-Minerals and Fuel].
There is no possible way that I could hash out
all the crimes against humanity perpetrated via the philosophy of Henry
Kissinger as well as has the late
Christopher Hitchens already.

What I find very
interesting is how the Jewish Dr. Kissinger regarded the plight of Jews in
then Soviet Russia, On March 1, 1973, Kissinger stated,
The emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an objective of
American foreign policy, and if they put Jews into gas chambers in the
Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern.
That statement is merely a statement, and of course scores of persons say a
thing and then their actions show another ideology altogether, but it is a
very interesting statement in light of the fact that Dr. Kissinger's deeds
seem to have forever been pro Israel while at the same time being anti
American.
Perhaps Dr. Kissinger made that very cold statement in light of
Richard Nixon's handling of the US policy towards Israel. Nixon had forbade
anyone Jewish from being involved in the US policy towards Israel, or
perhaps Kissinger is truly that cold hearted.
Henry Kissinger and his political philosophy affected not just Israel, but
the entire globe, often mass murder and subversion of democratically elected
governments was the order of the day, and though Henry Kissinger is no
longer an active member of our official federal government, Henry lives on,
as an elderly man that eats despite believing or stating that the elderly
are useless eaters.
His globe expanding vision of subversive machinations in
favor of oligarchy have made him infamous, and synonymous with evil.
The
world is a fickle world, and the wealthy have their way always with
misinformed persons in the populace.
Exploitation and subversion for
oligarchy was long the ways and means of these United States under the
influence of Kissinger - but today, the circle is complete, and the peoples
of the USA are reaping their own harvest for being so blind, and today the
people's of the USA are being exploited in the exact ways prescribed a
couple decades ago by the tremendous Dr. Henry Kissinger.
