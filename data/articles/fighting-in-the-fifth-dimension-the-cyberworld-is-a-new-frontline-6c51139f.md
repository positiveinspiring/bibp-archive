It has been called the 'fifth dimension of warfare'.

It has been called the fifth dimension of warfare. Along with land, sea, air
and space - the cyberworld is a new frontline. Innovations in technology are

Helped by advances in electro-magnetics and modern information and
communications technology, a new form of electronic warfare has been
created. It is called cyberwar and is increasingly recognized by governments
and the military as posing a potentially grave threat.
If you have a few smart people and a good computer, then you can do a lot.
You dont need an aircraft, you dont need tanks, you dont need an army.
You can penetrate another country, create huge damage without even leaving
your armchair.
And it is not just cyberwar that is a growing phenomenon. The internet has
empowered cyberactivism, allowing people to share information and mobilize
support to take direct action - both online and on the streets.
The so-called Arab Spring has been described as an electronic revolution.
Protesters were turned into citizen journalists - taking frontline images on
their mobile phones and uploading them via their computers for the world to
see.
The regimes may have jammed the signals of
satellite news channels and banned international reporters from entering
their country, but they were unable to prevent citizens from becoming
reporters in their own right.
