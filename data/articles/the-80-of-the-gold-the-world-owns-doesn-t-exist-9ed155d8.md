Chris Powell, Secretary and Treasurer of the Gold Anti-Trust Action
Committee told Bernie Lo on CNBC Asia overnight that central banks
are continuing to manipulate the gold market as they are interested in
supporting government bonds and the dollar and keeping interest rates low.
Powell warns about paper gold and says that
we,
try to persuade investors that if they are
purchasing gold, they had better get real gold - metal. They should not
get paper gold and keep it within the banking system.
He says that,
there is huge naked short position in gold
and estimates that perhaps 75% to 80% of the gold that the world thinks
it owns does not exist and is just a claim on a bullion bank that is
underwritten basically by the central banks.
Bernie Lo asks what is the end result?
With regard to price Powell said that he does not make predictions but he
wonders,
what the value or the price of gold will be if the world ever
discovers that 80% of the gold that it thinks it owns - does not exist.
There may not be enough zeros in the world to put behind the gold price
then.
Powell said that buyers should own gold in your hand or in allocated format
outside of the banking system.
He concluded by saying that surreptitious intervention in the gold market
can continue as long as gold buyers do not own real physical bullion.
We do not endorse GATAs opinions however some of their evidence and many of
their arguments are persuasive. We have yet to see any analyst or
commentator address the substantive issues they have raised and debunk or
refute their allegations.
Free markets need freedom of speech and a plurality of opinion.
Group think
and cozy consensus got us into todays the financial and economic mess.
Therefore, open, frank and rational debate about all aspects of the precious
metal and other markets and our current monetary system is important.
Being fully informed of all of the facts and fundamentals driving markets
are essential in order to protect and grow wealth.
