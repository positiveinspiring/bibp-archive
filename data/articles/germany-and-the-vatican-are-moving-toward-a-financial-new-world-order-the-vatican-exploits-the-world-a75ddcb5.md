The American economic crisis has unleashed forces of political upheaval that
are propelling both Germany and the Vatican to the forefront of world
affairs.

Recent developments reveal that Germany is
seeking to rally all Europe under Teutonic leadership in order to replace
the United States as the worlds sole financial superpower. Meanwhile, the
Vatican is seeking to establish itself as the guiding force behind this
forming European Empire.
By working together, these two entities are
furthering their respective goals.
German politicians have been especially vocal in putting the blame for the
current economic upheaval squarely on the U.S. and on the shortcomings of
U.S.-style capitalism. Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was the U.S.
and British failure to listen to Germany that allowed the banking sector to
get out of hand. According to German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck,
another system, one that will make the world multipolar, is needed.
Meanwhile, European Council President Nicolas Sarkozy went so far as
to declare the American economic system dead. Following this declaration, he
proposed a special conference be convened to rebuild the entire global
financial and monetary system from the bottom up, the way it was done at
Bretton Woods after World War II.
As the financial crisis intensifies, Germany is specifically disassociating
itself from the U.S. epicenter in an effort to present itself as a credible
economic alternative. But if Europe is to be a viable alternative to the
U.S.-centric system, a truly integrated Europe, with a truly united economic
policy, needs to be presented. And Germany is letting its European allies
know that, as the worlds largest goods exporter and the paymaster of
Europe, it stands ready to lead the eurozone to superpower status should
such a unified economy be established.
But it will take more than the desire to replace the U.S. as global leader
to forge Europes individual economies into one over-arching monetary and
political system.
The only way the various cultures and
nationalities in Europe could possibly be united is through common ideology.
Pope
Benedict XVI and his Vatican
hierarchy recognize this fact. They are eyeing this economic crisis as
an opportunity to establish Catholicism as the guiding force behind this
forming European superpower.
Politics needs religion, Vatican Secretary
of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone said on September 30 in a
speech published by Vatican mouthpiece LOsservatore Romano.
When instead God is ignored, the ability to respect rights and
recognize the common good begins to disappear.
The prelate went on to claim the current
financial crisis was a result of a lack of Christian values in global
politics.
Bertones comments followed a similar admonishment by the secretary of the
Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, Giampaolo Crepaldi,
who called for Catholics to take a more active role in politics and stop
leaving God in the pew. Such comments are backed by the pope, who
noted on October 6 that the collapse of major banks shows that money is
nothing and that only Gods words are a solid reality.
The
Vatican is putting forward its brand of religious teachings as
the solution to the worlds financial woes.
First the Vatican embedded Catholic laity in labor movements, government
bureaucracies and secret services across Europe. Now it is calling upon
these same people to use their positions of influence to further the
ambitions of the church. This is the popes strategy for transforming
the Catholic Church into the guiding political ideology that will unite all
Europe.
Soon Europe will be looking to the Vatican for political guidance and to
Germany for economic leadership. This united European Empire will then be
able to supplant ailing Americas global economic hegemony and emerge as the
worlds sole financial superpower.
As shocking as these predictions may sound, they were all made some 2,000
years ago and recorded in your Bible.
Biblical passages like Revelation 17 reveal that a powerful religious
entity will rise up in the end time and become the guiding force over a
resurrected Holy Roman Empire.
This powerful church-state combine is
prophesied to be a great economic powerhouse that intoxicates all nations
with its wealth and splendor. Revelation 18:3 says,
The merchants of the earth have become rich
through the abundance of her luxury.
(New King James Version)
Notice this verse does not say that only the
merchants of Europe will profit from this new economic system. It says that
the merchants of the earth have become rich through the abundance of her
luxury.
This Catholic-dominated European Empire is to
establish a global financial system that will encompass the entire planet.
After the dollar falls, the world is going to get a new reserve currency.
There is a dark side, however, to this coming financial system. Verses 12
and 13 of this same chapter specify the vast markets that this mighty empire
in the north will trade in, including slaves, and souls of men. It will
operate in the slave market just as Adolf Hitlers Third Reich used
slave labor to power its industrial complexes along the Ruhr River.
This church-state combine is prophesied to plunge the world into a
new dark age.
Yet there is hope beyond the bad news. This same chapter also foretells
that, after this empire has reigned only a short time, Christ will
return to the Earth and smash this power to pieces. He will then establish
his Kingdom on Earth, and this Kingdom will never be destroyed.
