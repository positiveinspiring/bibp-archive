# Mega-BankÂ’s Plan to Steal Your Money and Blame Fake Muslim Cyber Attack

Senator and
self-proclaimed Zionist Joseph Lieberman declared that it was Iran
who cyber-attacked Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase in 2011 and began
with more frequency this year.
Lieberman, as the chairman of the
Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee states that the
financial attack was spurned from the state-sponsored anti-Muslim film
circulating the Middle East thanks to CIA-operatives al-Qaeda.
Lieberman explains in below video:
I dont believe these were just hackers. I believe this was done by
Iran and the Qods force, which has its own developing cyber-attack
capacity.
And I believe it was in response to the increasingly strong
economic sanctions that the United States and our European allies have
put on Iranian financial institutions.
The US government is planting the propaganda seed that according to
highly classified documents provided by the Join Chiefs of Staffs
Intelligence Directorate confirm that Iranian hackers are committing
cyber-attacks against US financial institutions.
This report assures that US mega-banks are a valid target of the
Iranian cyber army. However, the attackers used a known forum that is
utilized by the
CIA-controlled Anonymous to issue threats and brag about their
successes.
The timing of the newly formed digital al-Qaeda and their expressed
anger over the US-produced anti-Muslim film are questionable considering
how the US and Israeli government are setting the stage for a justified
war with Iran.
This fake hacker group is threatening other countries
controlled by the Zionist regime, such as France, Germany and Britain.
According to the false flag group:
The army was recently formed and
we have started to work as a team after we used to work individually.
The hacking operations are of course a response to the offence against
the prophet, peace and blessing be upon him.
Radware, a security firm, analyzed
the attacks and concluded that the alleged Iranian nameless, faceless
cyber army accused to attacking BoA and JPMorgan Chase did not conduct
the attack.
This week, Wells Fargo & Co. upped
their cybersecurity measures after being attacked by a nameless,
faceless group calling themselves Cyber Fighters of Izz ad-din Al Qassam.
Wells Fargo announced in a formal statement:
We apologize to customers
who may be experiencing intermittent access issues to wellsfargo.com and
online banking. We are working to quickly resolve this issue.
Customer complaints included difficulty logging-in as well as pages not
loading properly.
Cyber Fighters of Izz ad-din Al Qassam claimed that their attack was
retaliatory for the anti-Muslim film produced by the US government.
According to House Representative Mike Rogers, the anti-Muslim film was
released to cover the US governments
involvement in the bombing and death of US Ambassador J. Christopher
Stevens at the hand of the CIA-sponsored al-Qaeda.
The film in question is actually a 14 minute trailer written, produced
and directed by Sam Bacile, a.k.a. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula who is
an FBI informant , an Israeli citizen and the pasty used by the
Zionist regime in order to facilitate a manufactured revolt of fake
Islamic tension in the Middle East.
Just as the
false flag bomb threats called in by anonymous members of al-Qaeda
earlier this month, this banking threat has the hall marks of a
state-sponsored false flag to unnerve the American public, mask a
planned implosion of the US economy through the ultimate theft of the
banking cartels: the money deposited into private checking accounts by
banking customers.
On August 9th the banks were given the legal authority to
steal money from their customers private accounts just as
Jon Corzine had with MF Global with the
ruling on Sentinel Management Group.
Based on the ruling, regulatory systems such as the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (SPIC) will not insure customer funds, investments,
depositors and retirees who hold accounts in banks.
In fact, the FDIC
has
announced that beginning in January 2013, they will stop insuring
all deposits.
Of the estimated $1.6 trillion in deposits, and a measured
85-90% in the hands of the mega-banks, large depositors are expected to
close their accounts due to the lack of security.
The money in deposits will be funneled through the US Treasury for
short-term securities.
It is expected that the US Treasury will offer
negative interest rates and this combination will surely cause a run on
the banks that will put Spain and Greece to shame.
Per request of the Federal Reserve Bank, in 2010 the mega-banks filed
contingency plans wherein the US government could not assist them.
Called
resolution plans, they describe how to liquidate banking assets
without causing further damage to a failing financial system. By selling
non-core assets without upsetting shareholders while protecting the
monetary system, taxpayers and creditors is the work of the mega-banks
who have contributed solely to the destruction of the global financial
markets.
In the event of insolvency, duress or bankruptcy, the banks could use
customer secured funds to assist them in repaying debts and loans.
Currently Bank of America (BoA) has
sold off portions of their domestic assets to secure capitol while
Citigroup has followed suit.
By adhering to initiatives provided by the
Financial Stability Board, these mega-banks will, when they enact
their resolution plans, coordinate with international banking
institutions and regulators rather than simply implode.
While preparing for financial collapse, the technocrats on Wall Street
are also acquiring firearms, ammunition and control over private
mercenary corporations like DynCorp and Blackwater as authorized by
the Department of Defense (DoD) directive
3025.18.
Recently, the former mortgage broker of JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley
revealed that due to their involvement in the mortgage-backed securities
and derivatives fraud, they are selling off their non-core assets.
This
means that
Morgan Stanley is becoming
insolvent.
The recent false flag attacks on our banks falls in line with the
scenario that has been coming into view for quite some time. In America,
just announcing a banking holiday would cause absolute chaos and there
may not be enough armed forces within our US borders to handle the
rioting in the streets. However, the banking cartels must implode the US
economy in order to gain the sovereign debt - as they are currently
doing in Spain and Greece.
Meanwhile, there is a Zionist plot to attack Iran over false claims of
procurement of nuclear weapons that do not exist.
Israeli Prime Minister
Netanyahu has been
decrying this lie since 1992. Twenty years later, it appears that
the Zionist-controlled Israeli government may just have their war with
Iran along with the unwavering support of the US government.
Framing Iran for the American banking systems computer failure kills
two birds with one stone.
Not only would the banking cartels be able to
shut down all banking computers (and simultaneously syphon the
remaining money in their customers accounts) but also use this fake
cyber-attack to engage the American public against Iran and justify
their highly anticipated military strike.
By blaming Iran, the technocrats could initiate the shutdown of all
domestic banking computer systems in order to purge the virus and
reconfigure their systems.
However this would be a false flag meant to
pacify the public to avert mass panic. While the general public would
fall for the cover story, the banking cartels would simply
electronically transfer all customer funds from private checking
accounts out to off-shore banks where they could not be touched and
cover their tracks.
The American public, being told that Iran was to blame might not riot in
the streets as we have seen in European countries of late. There would
be total support for the war with Iran if this scheme could be pulled
off. The technocrats could not only bankrupt America but also
simultaneously stave off a social display and breakdown of society
because the Iranians would be to blame.
The plan is perfect. All we have to do is not be fooled and use the
recent riots in Spain as a barometer as to how we can take this country
back from the Zionists and the banking cartels.
