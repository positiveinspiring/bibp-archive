A State Of Terror - Of
The Few, By The Few And For The Few
The United States of America, at this time, is the primary conduit,
instrument and catalyst, employed by an age-old line of supremacists, in the
finalisation of an ancient quest for global totalitarianism.
The last remaining superpower, now an unmitigated rogue state, is being used
as both the sharp end of the stick, to back everyone into a corner, and a
blunt instrument to beat them into submission.
The New World Order
has been under construction for a very long time
But how long?
Some 60
families - names like
Rockefeller, Morgan, Dodge, Mellon,
Pratt, Harkness, Whitney, Duke, Harriman, Carnegie, Vanderbilt, DuPont,
Guggenheim, Astor, Lehman, Warburg, Taft, Huntington, Baruch and
Rosenwald - formed a close network of plutocratic wealth that
manipulated, bribed, and bullied its way to control the destiny of the
United States.
They operated in absolute secrecy, lest the general public understand
how the banks money manipulated political decisions behind the scenes,
including decisions to go to war or to keep the peace.
F. William Engdahl
Gods of Money
Whats In A Name?
Bundy, Collins, Freeman, Kennedy, Li, Onassis, Reynolds,
Rothschild, Russell, Van Duyn...
There are antediluvian bloodlines, names both famous and obscure, which have
been crossbreeding, strictly within their own class, for many centuries.
They have been passing along a
psychopathic genetic aberration and patiently
manipulating human events for many centuries with a single purpose in mind;
the total subjugation of the rest of humanity.
They are parasites upon the body of the human species.
Some of these families reach back into the depths of antiquity to draw their
self-proclaimed supremacy from the ancient rulers of Mesopotamia, the
Fertile Crescent, home to the fabled Garden of Eden.
The land upon which that bit of legend was built
almost certainly now
lies submerged beneath the waters of the Persian Gulf.
It is quite probable that this region, broadly speaking, was the first place
on Earth where, from around twelve thousand to as much as 14,500 years ago,
the human species began the transition from nomadic gathering and hunting to
sedentary agriculture in and around a place called
Göbekli Tepe, about 800 miles northwest of
Kuwait.
This Neolithic Revolution was perhaps a great misstep on the path of human
evolution.
It has been hypothesized from the archeological evidence found at Göbekli
Tepe that this area and time may have been the point in the human experiment
where people first began to see themselves as separate from and superior to
Nature and the rest of the Life on Earth.
Fatal error
Klaus Schmidt, now a researcher at the German Archaeological
Institute (DAI), has been working the Göbekli Tepe site since 1994.
Anthropologists have assumed that organized
religion began as a way of salving the tensions that inevitably arose
when hunter-gatherers settled down, became farmers, and developed large
societies.
Göbekli Tepe, to Schmidt's way of thinking, suggests a reversal of that
scenario: The construction of a massive temple by a group of foragers is
evidence that organized religion could have come before the rise of
agriculture and other aspects of civilization.
It suggests that the human impulse to gather
for sacred rituals arose as humans shifted from seeing themselves as
part of the natural world to seeking mastery over it.

The most significant observation and insight of
the investigation. A wrong turn on a one-way street.
Big mistake
This shift in perception, which was likely engineered or, at the very least,
co-opted and nurtured by the earliest ancestors of those families mentioned
above, set us on a one-way street of unnatural, self-worshiping materialism,
which has led us ultimately to
the brink of extinction.
Religion - The First
Form Of Totalitarianism
The separation of the priesthood, the chosen of god, and the laity is
intrinsic to the
hierarchical nature of organized religion. Although not
limited exclusively to it, this is especially emphasized in monotheism.
Unlike many early Pagan cults, which ranked the human among all the other
Life of Earth, as a part of the fabric of Nature, the predominant
monotheistic cults also share the common characteristic of making humanity
the special favorite of the god, superior to all other Life and free to
exploit the vital resources of Nature without restraint. How convenient for
us, how considerate of our special god.
Such hierarchical constructs, requiring complete submission and belief, make
a perfect vehicle for those who seek dominion over others.
It allows them to create a two-class system
wherein they, the priests, the only ones with access to the god, can build
power and amass wealth thereby gaining control of those things vital to the
survival of those who follow them.
At the same time they give their subjects a
sense of importance and superiority by emphasizing their favored status with
the god and their right to dominance over Nature and the rest of Life.
Perhaps herein lies the explanation of the inexplicable phenomena of
productive, otherwise seemingly rational people, submitting to the rule of a
non-productive, psychopathic parasite class when it is patently not in their
best interest to do so.
This paradigm is transposed quite easily to the template of modern
civilization.
The economic system of laissez faire capitalism is a faith-based religion.
It is founded completely on belief rather than
reality, fact or science. It requires the consumer flock to have complete
faith in the priesthood of the economists while worshipping the god Mammon
unreservedly and without question.
The Chicken Or The
Egg, The Church Or The Farm?
It has long been widely accepted that the transition to an agrarian social
structure, the Neolithic Revolution, gave rise to the need for religion as
a means to stabilize, unify and sedate the populace during the transition
from nomadic Life to a large, fixed society. It now appears the inverse may
have been the case.
There are subtle indications in relatively recent archaeological discoveries
pointing to the possibility that religion or worship may have been
contrived; a purposed belief system, consciously fabricated by
self-worshiping humans, which created conditions ultimately leading to fixed
settlements.
Sedentary agriculture and the keeping of livestock would then have developed
out of necessity in response to the needs of growing, non-nomadic
populations as the quantity of game, wild grains and other foraged food
sources in the immediate area became inadequate.
This then led to villages, towns, cities, nations and, ultimately, the
global cancer of unrestrained growth by which we and our Life Support System
are being destroyed today.
Unrestrained growth, growth for its own sake, is the agenda of a cancerous
tumor, not that of a sentient intelligence or a civilization.
Ground Zero?
the area that today encompasses Israel, the
Palestinian territories, Lebanon, Jordan, and western Syria -
archaeologists had discovered settlements dating as far back as 13,000
B.C.
Known as Natufian villages (the name comes
from the first of these sites to be found), they sprang up across the
Levant as the Ice Age was drawing to a close, ushering in a time when
the region's climate became relatively warm and wet.
(source)
These settlements were not constructed by
farmers but by hunter-gatherers.
Yet although
the Natufians lived in permanent
settlements of up to several hundred people, they were foragers, not
farmers, hunting gazelles and gathering wild rye, barley, and wheat.
"It was a big sign that our ideas needed to
be revised," says Harvard University archaeologist Ofer Bar-Yosef.

-
Could Göbekli Tepe and the other
Natufian settlements be where anthropocentrism first reared its ugly
head?
-
Is this the time and place man created
god in his image?
-
Is this when and where the
anthropomorphic god was contrived and a hierarchical system of
worship designed to give certain men the ability to rule with
unquestioned power over everyone else?
-
Did the first parasitic, supremacist
psychopaths begin their conquest of humanity from this place and
time?
-
Did the tumor that has become the
worldwide cancer of Free Market Globalization first begin to
metastasize here?
Perhaps this was the time and place where we
first mistook rulers for leaders.
Rulers who understood that confining a
population to a single defined space made them easier to manipulate and
control. To be a successful sheep herder one must first acquire a flock of
sheep.
Such a stationary population, as its numbers grew, would require governance,
providing the parasite class, whose greatest skills are lying, deception,
exploitation and manipulation, with a golden opportunity.
Socially acceptable behavior would have to be defined and enforced. Was this
where the seeds of propaganda, indoctrination and the Police State were
planted? Religious dogma is the earliest form of mass indoctrination of
which I am aware.
A growing population in a fixed location, without the disciplined structure
of a small, nomadic hunter-gatherer unit, would require a body of laws and
rules to avoid falling into chaos and anarchy.
Once there are laws, it follows as does night the day, there must, of
necessity, be someone to enforce them.
As the population grew, these regulations, controlling and directing social
interactions, would also grow in number and complexity.
As they became increasingly restrictive, the
majority could be more easily forced to serve the priestly minority who,
after all, received those regulations directly from the god and by whom the
enforcers were employed.
The Proverbial Last
Straw
Wherever it began, where will it end?
America was certainly not by any means the first step taken on the long
slippery slope to the edge of the abyss over which we now dangle by our
collective fingertips. However, if corrective action is not taken very soon,
it may become the last.
The New World Order of the supremacists will become reality. How long will
it last? Probably not all that long. But the damage will be irreparable.
Time to start over from the beginning:
"got to get back to the land and set
my soul free".
(Woodstock - Written by Joni Mitchell, popularized by Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young)
The Rubicon has been crossed. Things are never going back to normal. Normal
is the problem.
This cycle will run to completion and those who rise from
the ashes when its over will have to begin anew. Hopefully this time they
will retain enough history and group memory of the past to avoid just doing
the same thing over again.
Doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results is a good
definition of insanity.
A New World Order Of
Peace And Freedom
The first half of the phrase above has come to represent, to most, something
to be feared and avoided; something inherently evil.
But if combined with the second half, it becomes
something altogether different.
A totalitarian one world government, a single world currency and a global
ruling class are not prerequisites to achieving a world united in Peace and
prosperity. Nor are those things in any way desirable except to the few who
would rule.
The many People of Earth, in all their diversity, if not for the few that
manipulate and oppress them, would gladly live together in Peace, Tolerance
and Cooperation.
The moment the many stop bickering amongst themselves over petty differences
and turn their unified attention upon the true enemy of all, the few who
have brought this ruin upon Earth and Life; in that moment the tide will
turn and an unstoppable tsunami of Joy and Love will cleanse Earth of fear
and hate.
In that moment, the human race will finally take a significant step toward
true civilization.
There is no way to Peace. Peace is the way.
- A.J. Muste
