Last year, the price of global food floated high
as ever.
That's bad news for most of us, but not for
those who trade commodities. In fact, 2011 was a great year for the traders,
who thrive on bad news, currency woes, drought, flood, freeze, fire and all
other manifestations of imminent apocalypse.
2011 was a wild ride. One spring morning, cocoa futures dropped 12% in less
than a minute. Corn ascended to all-time peaks and sugar fluctuated more in
one day than it used to in a month. Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, railed
against speculators in coffee, while PepsiCo forecast its own medium-term
commodity cost increases to exceed $1bn.
All of which meant a bumper crop for the world's
commodity exchanges - even those that used to be backwaters, like the Kansas
City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, both of which
recorded their highest electronic trading volumes in history.
It was a volatile year, and the volatility posed problems for the food
industry.
Faced with a high-stakes game of price-shifting
basic ingredients, the world's largest food processors and retailers put out
the call for maths PhDs and economic modelers to theorize and implement
ever-more complex risk-management strategies just so they could keep up with
the second-by-second spikes and dips of grain and livestock futures. In the
meantime, high-frequency traders and momentum-driven hedge funds made it
their business to speculate on food.
There were plenty of ways to get in on the action, but as an increasingly
complex amalgam of food-based commodity derivatives piled one on top of the
other, the more difficult it became to perceive what it was that lay at the
bottom of the speculative scrum.
What drove the global food market in 2011 -
other than those old faithfuls, fear and greed? I put in a call to Professor
Yaneer Bar-Yam, of the New England Complex Systems Institute (Necsi), to see
if he might have an answer.
Necsi, based in Cambridge, draws on fields as various as maths, physics and
computer science to provide new perspectives on - and perhaps even solve -
pressing problems in economics, healthcare, international development, and
military and ethnic violence.
Last year, Bar-Yam and his colleagues published
a paper called
The Food Crises: A Quantitative Model of Food Prices
Including Speculators and Ethanol Conversion, in which the Necsi crew
mathematically isolated and quantified the effects of speculation as a
driving force behind the bull market in global food derivatives.
"Prices have been way out of equilibrium in
2011," Bar-Yam told me. "The bubble has not burst yet."
According to Bar-Yam, the international thirst
for biofuels has put a strain on arable land previously reserved for food
production.
At the same time as the rise of the biofuel mandate, the rise of
investable commodity indexes and other electronically traded funds has
offered investors of all stripes a chance to sink their cash in a sparkling
new casino of derivative products. As a result, an ever-flowing spring of
speculative capital sustains the status quo.
But just as food is no ordinary widget, speculation in commodity markets is
not simply a matter of financial predation.
"The high prices of food have resulted in
accumulations of inventories at the same time as people can't afford
food," said Bar-Yam, who noted that the Arab spring was triggered by the
food-price bubble.
In fact, Necsi's quantitative model of
speculation predicted the
uprisings in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt, and warned
that if food prices remain inflated, riots and revolutions will go global sometime between July 2012 and August 2013.
"We are at a critical point," said Bar-Yam.
"We don't have a stay-the-course option right now."
He believes the time has come for global
regulators to step in and manage the global market.
-
Their first task would
be to guarantee transparency and make public information previously shrouded
in secrecy - such as who holds the biggest stakes in global commodities.
Transparent accounting practices would have made the disappearance of
$1.2bn
worth of customer money from the books of MF Global less a matter of sleight
of hand and more a matter of international crime.
-
The second part of the speculation solution hinges on a return to
traditional position limits in commodities, limits enforced by international
laws geared to stop bankers, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds from
going long on the world's food supply and, in effect, gambling on hunger.
Nothing influences financial regulators like equations, so the reforms we
can look forward to in 2012 will ultimately depend on the numbers.
Which is
a mixed blessing.
"One reason people don't want to understand
the math is the deafness of those who are making the money," said
Bar-Yam. "But the old mathematics is manifestly wrong."
