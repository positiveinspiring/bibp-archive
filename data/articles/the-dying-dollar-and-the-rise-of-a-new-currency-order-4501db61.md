For years now, the collapse of the dollar has been in the cards.
Recent developments show mounting pressure on
the dollars reserve currency status. With a major international deflation
going on, the threat of inflation through money printing is unreal.
However, should the dollars reserve currency
status end, the repatriation of trillions of petro- and eurodollars could
lead to a strongly inflationary scenario.
The roles of a reserve currency are to finance international trade and to
function as a store of value for Governments. Until the second world war it
used to be the British pound, but with the demise of the British Empire, the
pound lost its international relevance and was overtaken by the dollar.
This was formalized in the 1944
Bretton Woods system.
All other currencies were fiat currencies, but
pegged to the dollar, which in turn was pegged to Gold at 40 dollars an
ounce and redeemable for international trading partners.
The Eurodollar
With the dollar as the reserve currency, the US had to export dollars.
In the early years after the war especially for
Europe, the famous Eurodollars.
This sounds great: print money and buy whatever
you like. But with the Gold window it was also risky: overprinting could
mean excess dollars would be exchanged back to Gold, depleting US Gold
reserves.
This was also a weakness that those annoyed with American Hegemony could
exploit. In 1967 the leftist press mogul Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber
penned a famous screed called le défi Américain (the American challenge),
arguing Europe was being colonized economically by superior American
competition.
France, at the time, was run by de Gaulle, who never was impressed
with Anglo-American supremacy. He made a point of exchanging every dollar he
could lay his hands on as a means to undermine it.
In the late sixties the situation got badly out of hand because of the Great
Society and the Vietnam war, very costly projects that were deficit
financed, leading to serious inflationary pressures. Inflation that the US
tried to export, leading to an excess of dollars abroad.
Especially the resurging Deutschmarks
appreciation became untenable.
The Europeans started pressuring the US to fix
its deficits, provoking the US Treasury Secretary John Connally
famous cry,
the dollar is our currency and your
problem.
But the situation had become unsustainable and
Nixon was forced to close the Gold window to stop the
depletion of US gold.
This was the end of the Bretton Woods system
and from then on the major currencies were floated freely in the
international currency markets.
The Petrodollar
But it did not end the dollar reserve currency status, as the "Empire" had
been found another basis for it:
they reached an agreement with the House of
Saud, to accept only dollars for its oil.
The Sauds agreed to invest their dollar wealth
on Wall Street, making the deal even more powerful for the Empire.
Saudi Arabia controlled OPEC and the dollar was
saved: international oil trading is financed with dollar only. Since then we
have been on an informal Black Gold standard, known as the petrodollar.
This situation was better than before, because overprinting of the dollar
for international trade or to finance all sorts Empire projects could no
longer be punished by depleting Gold reserves and would result only in
rising prices.
In the last decade the problem of over printing was solved by artificially
raising oil prices through the Peak Oil hoax, and ending Iraqi oil
production. It must be understood that the Empire is not looking for more
oil production.
There is so much oil in the world that should it
be drilled for freely, it would end the Money Powers energy monopoly. The
Iraq invasion and the quest for control of the Middle-East is to keep a lid
on oil production. Saddams suicidal decision to accept Euro for his oil
only hastened his demise.
Even today Iraqi oil production is not even half of what it was before 1991.
With the Western Oil companies now in charge, it will most likely never
fully recover.
By raising the price for oil, the oil market has
mopped up excess dollar supplies, which are now needed for the oil trade. As
a result, the dollar has remained relatively stable in its value. Of course,
it fits well with the agenda of decapitating the middle classes and under
this agreement higher oil prices also means ever more oil profits invested
in Wall Street.
Of course, the great boon of this for the Empire is that it can pay with
worthless paper for real goods. It can eternally finance a major trade
deficit.
Trade deficits are incorrectly understood as problematic.
From a nations point of view, the goal of trade is not to export, but to
import. We export to give back for what we need from others. If you run the
reserve currency, you dont need to export as much as you import, because
you can partially finance your imports with money printing.
For all other nations this is impossible and
trade deficits are lethal in the long run, as it leads to net capital
outflow.
But
the US Empire is in trouble. Its
infrastructure is crumbling, its manufacturing base gone, its badly over
extended. It needs ever more virulent threats to coerce the nations into
dollar submission and just like Connally failed in 1971, the US is failing
today. The Money Power is done with the Empire and the dollar and it
is moving to the next phase.
The dollar will have to step back and we are
seeing a realignment.
The new currency order
China is moving towards a Gold backed Yuan that will be very powerful
in the international arena.
Recently Australia, which is already completely
dependent on China, with 30% of its exports going there, is preparing direct
convertibility between the Yuan and the Australian dollar, meaning they will
no longer use US dollar to finance bilateral trade. This means less US
dollars are needed in its reserve currency role.
In 2001 Goldman Sachs executive Jim ONeill invented
the BRICs.
South Africa was later added, representing
Africa and emphasizing its globalist agenda. Russia and China, as two
powerful neighbors, obviously have long standing and important bilateral
relations.
But equally obviously, have little in common
with Brazil, India and South Africa. India and China are actually sworn
enemies. However, in 2009 they organized a first summit. Just a week ago we
all of the sudden hear
the BRICS are planning to open up a competitor to the
IMF.
Theyre still working out the details and its
not a done deal yet, but the move looks very serious. And there is of course
the Euro, which, make no mistake, is in great shape.
True, Eurocrat legitimacy is suffering because
of the Euro crisis, even in Germany the currency is losing support.
But the Euro crisis is purely for internal
consumption, to sucker the nations into surrendering budget responsibility
to Brussels. This is the final frontier for a full blown EU federalist Super
State.
While the Euro is deeply hated, this is not
really a problem for the Money Power: it isnt in this business to make
friends and it does not mind a big fight. It only fears real alternatives
and these are nowhere to be seen. There is nobody proposing anything real,
people are just letting off steam.
Once they get their fiscal union, the crisis
will quickly end. People have a short memory.
The Euro was designed to be eventually backed by Gold and the ECB has enough
of the stuff to be ready for the coming transition.
Conclusion
We are seeing the advent of the new currency order.
There will be a number of more or less equal
blocks:
These will later be able to converge to even
more cooperation, in the Money Powers relentless march towards World
Currency.
These units will be at least partially Gold backed, implying long term
deflationary pressures. Central Banks are buying Gold in major quantities,
creating the interesting question why Gold prices have not risen in the
last 18 months.
The problem for the United States will be to manage the transition.
Trillions of dollars that will no longer be needed will have to be
repatriated and this will lead to very strong inflationary pressures at
home. It is unclear how
the FED is going to deal with that. It
probably cant.
Furthermore, the US is probably in the worst of
positions to deal with a new Gold standard. They claim to have 8,000
tonnes of Gold in Fort Knox, but nobody really believes that.
The hyperinflation scare that the Austrians have been promoting because of
money printing is ridiculous: we are in a
stagflationary depression and prices are rising because of speculation,
not because of excess money.
But when the dollar loses its current status,
long term price rises will become the norm.
The Greatest Depression has only just started.
Afterthought
Heres a highly recommended post by Roberts,
the Assault on Gold. It makes a plausible
case for massive Fed bullion busting.
As discussed in why
is Gold not Rising?, the ascent of
Gold was a carefully orchestrated operation, but it probably got out of hand
in 2011. Since then the FED has been very active on COMEX again. With CBs
and market players buying massive amounts, its the only logical explanation
for stalling bullion.
The fall of
COMEX and the fall of the Dollar are
basically an evil twin, they will happen simultaneously and because of each
other.
