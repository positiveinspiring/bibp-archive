Armed units from the private security firm
Blackwater USA opened fire in Baghdad streets twice in two days last week.
It triggered a standoff between the security
contractors and Iraqi forces, a reminder that the war in Iraq may be
remembered mostly in our history books for empowering and building America's
first modern mercenary army. There are an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 armed
security contractors working in Iraq, although there are no official figures
and some estimates run much higher. Security contractors are not counted as
part of the coalition forces.
When the number of private mercenary fighters is
added to other civilian military "contractors" who carry out logistical
support activities such as food preparation, the number rises to about
126,000.
"We got 126,000 contractors over there, some
of them making more than the secretary of defense," said House defense
appropriations subcommittee Chairman John Murtha (D., Pa.). "How
in the hell do you justify that?"
The privatization of war hands an incentive to
American corporations, many with tremendous political clout, to keep us
mired down in Iraq. But even more disturbing is the steady rise of this
modern Praetorian Guard.
The Praetorian Guard in ancient Rome was a
paramilitary force that defied legal constraints, made violence part of the
political discourse, and eventually plunged the Roman Republic into tyranny
and despotism. Despotic movements need paramilitary forces that operate
outside the law, forces that sow fear among potential opponents, and are
capable of physically silencing those branded by their leaders as traitors.
And in the wrong hands, a Blackwater could well
become that force.
American taxpayers have so far handed a staggering $4 billion to "armed
security" companies in Iraq such as Blackwater, according to House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Henry Waxman
(D., Calif.).
Tens of billions more have been paid to
companies that provide logistical support. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D.,
Ill.) of the House Intelligence Committee estimates that 40 cents of every
dollar spent on the occupation has gone to war contractors. It is unlikely
that any of these corporations will push for an early withdrawal. The
profits are too lucrative...
Mercenary forces like Blackwater operate beyond civilian and military law.
They are covered by a 2004 edict passed by American occupation authorities
in Iraq that immunizes all civilian contractors in Iraq from prosecution.
Blackwater, barely a decade old, has migrated from Iraq to set up operations
in the United States and nine other countries. It trains Afghan security
forces and has established a base a few miles from the Iranian border. The
huge contracts from the war - including $750 million from the State
Department since 2004 - have allowed Blackwater to amass a fleet of more
than 20 aircraft, including helicopter gunships.
Jeremy Scahill, the author of
Blackwater - The Rise of the World's Most Powerful
Mercenary Army, points out that Blackwater has also constructed,
"the world's largest private military
facility - a 7,000-acre compound near the Great Dismal Swamp of North
Carolina."
Blackwater also recently opened a facility in
Illinois ("Blackwater North") and, despite local opposition, is moving ahead
with plans to build another huge training base near San Diego. The company
recently announced it was creating a private intelligence branch called
"Total Intelligence."
Erik Prince, who founded and runs Blackwater, is a man who appears to
have little time for the niceties of democracy. He has close ties with the
radical Christian Right and the Bush White House. He champions
his company as a patriotic extension of the U.S. military.
His employees, in an act as cynical as it is
dishonest, take an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. But what he and his
allies have built is a mercenary army, paid for with government money, which
operates outside the law and without constitutional constraint.
Mercenary units are a vital instrument in the hands of despotic movements.
Communist and fascist movements during the last century each built rogue
paramilitary forces.
And the appearance of Blackwater fighters,
heavily armed and wearing their trademark black uniforms, patrolling the
streets of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, may be a
grim taste of the future.
In New Orleans Blackwater charged the government
$240,000 a day.
"'It cannot happen here' is always wrong,"
the philosopher Karl Popper wrote. "A dictatorship can happen
anywhere."
The word contractor helps launder the fear and
threat out of a more accurate term: "paramilitary force."
We're not supposed to have such forces in the
United States, but we now do. And if we have them, we have a potential
threat to democracy. On U.S. soil, Blackwater so far has shown few signs of
being an out-and-out rogue retainer army, though they looked the part in New
Orleans. But were this country to become even a little less stable, outfits
like Blackwater might see a heyday.
If the United States falls into a period of
