# How Government Masks the Plight of Spain's Lost Generation

"¡Que se jodan!"
With these words (which roughly translate as
"F**k them"), the
Spanish Member of Parliament Andrea Fabra greeted her party leader
Mariano Rajoy's parliamentary announcement, in July 2012, of new
cuts in unemployment benefits.
Unbeknownst to Fabra, all three of her words were caught on
camera. In predictable fashion, the video went viral, sparking a
wave of indignation as well as an online petition for her
resignation.
But Fabra, the proud daughter of a jailed former big
shot of the governing People's Party, refused to yield. She offered
no public apology, instead dispatching a handwritten letter to the
head of the chamber in which she lamented her "inappropriate" choice
of words.
Now, two years on, Fabra's inappropriate choice of words have
taken on a chillingly prophetic edge. Granted, there can be no
telling whether the target of her wrath was really the unemployed;
or whether it was, as she claims, the main opposition party, the
PSOE.
Either way, she got what she wanted: the PSOE is, to her use
her term, f**ked, as voters flee its sinking ship; and so, too, are
Spain's unemployed - all 4.4 million of them, 40% of whom now have
no "official" source of income.
Bullshit Jobs and Eternal Internships
Also f**ked are growing ranks of Spanish workers, in particular
the youngest.
Ultimately, it is they who have borne the brunt of the
economic fallout from Spain's real estate crash and the
Troika-imposed internal devaluation that followed in its wake. In
newly reformed Spain, it is they who must eke out a precarious
existence on the margins and the meager scraps provided by bullshit
temporary jobs and eternal internships.
And it is they who will have to pay off the government's debt
(ha!) as well as support their parents and grandparents through
their retirements (ha!).
Exactly how they are supposed to do this is
anyone's guess, especially given their current financial malaise. If
lucky, they might one day earn the minimum wage; many will earn
less.
As for job security, there is none: nine out of ten new job
contracts are temporary and in most professional sectors the
proportion of temporary contracts is already double the EU average.
What's more, over 40% of young Spanish workers are over qualified
for the jobs they hold, while eight out of ten millenials (that is,
those aged between 16 and 30) continue to live with their parents.
As for the lucky, brave few who strike out on their own, most of
them must cough up more than half of their income on rent, even for
shared accommodation.
This is just a little taste of the grim reality facing Spain's
lost and betrayed generation.
But it's not the only reality vying
for attention; there is also the government's version of events.
Lies, Damned Lies and Government Statistics
In the government's alternate reality, things could not be
rosier.
"We are on solid ground," Rajoy recently said.
"The recovery is here for good."
What he failed to mention was the main reason for this supposed
improvement:
namely that more and more Spaniards are falling into
bad old habits.
Egged on by the government and media, they are once
again buying lots of foreign-manufactured goods they probably don't
need with money they don't have.
That's right: thanks to a
relentless feel-good campaign, internal consumer demand is once
again soaring in Spain, just as the country's exports tumble. In
four short words: not a good sign.
But don't worry about that, the government tells the public
reassuringly. It'll sort itself out. [I'm liberally paraphrasing
here.] Instead, dear voters, come and feast your eyes on the latest
unemployment data and graphs (that some friends, ahem, just produced
for us). Notice how they go up and down in all the right places.
All of which is true. In fact, as economics graphs go, they look
pretty good.
However, as former senior business executive (of ENAGAS
and CAMPSA) Roberto Senteno notes in
El Confidencial, something doesn't quite add up.
For starters,
according to the statistical methodology employed, if a solid
40-hour-a-week job is destroyed and two 10-hour-a-week jobs are
created, as is happening more and more, Spain is all of a sudden one
job better off, and its economic situation has improved:
A total of 402,400 jobs have been
created (in the last year) using this crude trick alone.
The figure
actually drops to 61,000 if you seasonally adjust the data and
untangle all the lies and flawed assumptions about the active
population. But that's not all: the total number of hours worked has
dropped by 3.86 million in the last year.
Making a Mockery Out of Tragedy
If nothing else, the latest release from Spain's Ministry of
Information serves as a reminder of the grave risks of taking "raw"
government data at face value.
With the possible exception of the
big banks, no one has more skin in this rigged game than our
respective governments.
Indeed, since
the Great Recession began, the
one area in which government has truly excelled (with the obvious
help of certain media outlets and central banks) is in the "presentation" of
"raw" economic data.
Through its crude use of statistics, the Spanish government has
made a mockery out of tragedy.
Its reality of figures, graphs and
equations could not diverge more from the on-the-ground reality in
Spain, where conditions are set to get a whole lot worse as the IMF
and big business lobbies pressure struggling peripheral EU Member
States such as Spain to further reduce the minimum salary (currently
languishing at 635 a month) as well as enhance "labor mobility"
(i.e. make it even easier for companies to dismiss workers).
The result will be increased job insecurity and an even greater
preponderance of non-living wages.
Meanwhile, the exodus of Spain's
best and brightest will continue unabated. Not that the government
will care - indeed, if more and more young people leave the country,
the base population on which its unemployment stats are calculated
will decrease. And with a little fiddling here and touching up
there, its pretty graphs should look even prettier.
And that,
ultimately, is all that matters in this new age of statistical
madness.
Additional Information:
A new law in Spain hounds the new
media, from blogs to Google, to protect
the 'loyal' mainstream press
from insolvency and irrelevance. Other governments are ogling
similar laws.
Read
'To Protect the Press,' Spain Tries to Muffle the
Internet.
I would like
to begin this article by warning that it features no links to
any other website, for the simple reason that the Spanish
government is in the process of passing a new law that would
make linking to other Spanish websites "taxable."
The law,
commonly and rather misleadingly referred to as the "Google
Tax," forms part of a draft reform of Spain's Intellectual
Property Law that was hastily approved by the Spanish cabinet
last Friday.
According to Spain's Minister of Education, Culture and
Sport, José Ignacio Wert, the reform will permit the
reproduction of "non-significant fragments" (i.e. quoted and
hyper-linked texts from other websites) without prior
authorization, but it will also require the payment of "equitable compensation" for doing so.
In other words, whenever
a website aimed at "informing," "educating," or "entertaining"
users links to another website, it will have to pay a fee to do
so.
According to advocates of the law, its main targets are news
aggregators, such as Google News (hence the law's nickname) and
the purely user-driven
Meneame, which provide brief
introductions and links to the latest news from across the
Internet.
However, due to the highly ambiguous wording of the
law, there are fears that just about every kind of news-sharing
website, including blogs and even social media such as Facebook
and Twitter, could end up getting caught in the law's trawl net.
Whose Benefits?
The exclusive beneficiaries of the "Google Tax" are the
members of Spain's powerful newspaper publishers' lobby, the
AEDE.
The association's most influential members include,
-
Vocento
(the holding group of El Mundo)
-
Unidad Editorial
-
Prisa (the
holding group of El País)
-
Zeta
-
Prensa Ibérica
-
Godó
-
Audiovisual Española 2000
-
El Economista
-
La Voz de Galicia
To understand the main purpose of the law, one need only read
what AED Chairman Luis Enrique had to say after its passage:
This is the most important step
taken by the Spanish government for the protection of the
press.
And there you have it, the perfect summation:
"Protection of the Press."
What the new legislation effectively seeks to achieve is
enshrine into law a dual government shakedown and protection
racket. If passed (and it almost certainly will), the government
will have new powers to shakedown just about everybody in Spain
who links to a news or entertainment-focused website, while at
the same time protecting the traditional (and extremely loyal)
gate-keepers of public information, the mainstream press, from
the consequences of declining sales and shrinking relevance.
The "Google Law" is expected to raise roughly 80 million,
all of which will go into the coffers of AEDE members.
And boy,
do they need the money!
-
Unidad Editorial, the publisher of El
Mundo, doubled its losses to 20.6 million in the first quarter
of this year.
-
As for Prisa, the owner of Spain's biggest-selling
newspaper El País, it lost 47.5 million in the first quarter - almost four times what it lost during the same period last year.
-
In the last 10 years, Prisa has somehow managed to rack up total
debts of over 3.2 billion.
As I reported here (oops, no link: in theory, if the law is
passed, I would still have to pay the shakedown tax even for
linking to an article on my own site):
The end result is that the majority of PRISA's shares no
longer belong to the founding Polanco family, but instead to
banking institutions such as Santander, Caixabank and HSBC, not
to mention the Spanish telecommunications behemoth Telefoníca
and multibillionaire hedge fund owners such as Nicholas
Berggruen.
Having sold out to the financial sector, one can't help but
wonder just how effectively El País will be able to discharge
its reporting duties now that it is owned virtually lock, stock
and barrel by the same banks and financiers on which it is
supposed to report.
Changing Behavior, Changing Market
There are four main reasons why Spain's daily newspapers
- just like many newspapers around the globe - are on the verge of
insolvency.
-
First, fewer and fewer people are buying their print
editions. For example, Unidad Editorial's total circulation is
down 18% just in the last year.
-
Second, advertising revenues continue to plummet.
-
Third, competition is on the rise as enterprising journalists
take advantage of dramatically reduced cost barriers to launch
their own Internet news sites. El Diario, Publico, infoLibre, El
Confidencial, Diagonal Periodico, Voz Populí are just some
examples. All of them (none of whom are members of AEDE) are
chipping away at the readership of Spain's traditional
newspapers.
-
Fourth and perhaps most importantly, the behavior of news
consumers (I know, horrible term) is radically changing. Put
simply, the demographic trend is no longer the newspaper's
friend. Unlike their parents or their grandparents, the
digitally-native generation feels no allegiance whatsoever to
any one newspaper publication. They search out the news that
most interests them, by clicking on links on news aggregators,
social media, blogs, and alternative media.
It's for that reason that the new law is so pernicious.
Not
only does it seek to transfer funds from the pockets of just
about every information-sharing Internet user to the empty
pockets of semi-solvent newspapers, it also seeks to destroy
competition.
As
Guru Huky writes on his blog (if you're a
Spanish speaker, search for it on Google; it's well worth a
read), killing the link is equivalent to raising an enormous
entrance barrier. The link is what allows you to discover new things, new
pages, new media.
By silencing the Internet, some people think
that they can kill the competitive threat posed by new media.
Battleground Internet
At the turn of this fledgling century, the list of countries
using repressive measures to restrict Internet freedom read like
a who's who of unsavory regimes:
-
China
-
Bahrain
-
Saudi Arabia
-
Cuba,
you get the gist!
Now everybody's at it, including a growing number of
ostensibly democratic nations.
Through measures such as the
U.S.'s recent attack on Net Neutrality, the UK's sweeping
Internet surveillance laws, and now Spain's "Google Tax" (with
similar legislation being introduced in Germany and France), the
establishment seeks to radically reconfigure the very essence of
the Internet, by slowing users down, erecting barriers, and
monitoring our every movement.
It is - as it always was - about three main things: money,
power, and control. Warts and all, the Internet is a very
powerful public utility. It has offered individuals and groups
the ability for their voices to be heard and for dangerous ideas
to be shared - just as the printing press did in its day.
As
documentary film maker and economics blogger David Malone said
in an interview with Renegade Economist (Google it), bloggers
and alternative news sites are the pamphleteers of this new age.
And just as the Church did during the Reformation, our
governments seek to shut them up.
Here in Spain, the Internet community is already fighting
back.
The news aggregator Meneame has announced its intention to
relocate far beyond Spanish borders, as well as its decision to
no longer host any links to AEDE member sites - no idle threat,
considering the site provides roughly 2,000,000 clicks a
month to AEDE members.
As for Google, it has threatened to close down its news
service in Spain and now offers an extension on Chrome called
AEDE Blocker that users can use to stop themselves from being
able to access any news sites affiliated to AEDE.
Bloggers are
also publishing the links of unaffiliated news. If the movement
continues to snowball, the Google Tax may actually achieve the
exact opposite of its stated goal.
Rather than protecting the
mainstream press from the threat of competition, it may end up
accelerating its decline.
