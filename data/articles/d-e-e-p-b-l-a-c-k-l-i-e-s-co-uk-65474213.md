The dwelling concealed the entrance
to another Golden Lily site that is currently being
recovered. The search team have taken four years
to reach the treasure room - located over 200 feet
beneath ground - which is presently being
excavated. The Golden Lily buried the plunder
using sophisticated techniques and left signposts to
the treasure using unusual rock formations,
curiously cut rocks and other topographical
information (see below)
Known as the "Fish rock"
the marking on this rock indicate various traps,
details of the deposits stashed in the treasure
chamber and various depth measurements.
The small circle in the middle of
this rock indicates that a deposit in the room it was
found
Dubbed the "tunnel rock"
this indicates that five tunnels branch off ahead
leading to the treasure room.
