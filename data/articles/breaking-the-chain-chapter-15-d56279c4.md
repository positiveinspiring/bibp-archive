Core splits, Denial programming, the last
Five Steps of Discipline Virtual Reality Programming
Virtual reality programming (VR) is a form of programming that
has become more and more widely used in the past few decades. It involves
the person being placed in VR headsets and suit while a cult created
VR disk is used to run the program. It can be used to create 3D and
holographic images, and especially is useful in scripted programming,
and target practice sequences for assassin training. Under hypnosis
, the person will really believe they are in the scene.
Virtually any scenario can be recreated. Images to be “burned
in” will be shown on the VR disk, and reinforced repetitively
during the programming sequence. Some trainers feel it removes the element
of “human error” in training, and use it quite extensively.
VR programming, like any other programming, means going inside and finding
out the distortions that were placed in the parts that went through
the programming, allowing them to see how they were deceived, and dealing
with the trauma associated with the programming.
Denial Programming:
Denial programming begins with the first experiences the infant goes
through in life. The child has been horrendously wounded and traumatized,
yet the next morning, the adults around him are acting normally, as
if nothing had happened. They are modeling a lifestyle of denial for
the infant and young child. This is reinforced later by the child being
told:
“It was just a bad dream” (oh, how the child wants to believe
this lie. It makes the pain less to think it didn’t really happen)
“It’s just your imagination; it isn’t really happening”
(which is again embraced as an escape from the horror). Denial will
also be fed by the adults around the child telling them that they will
never be believed if they disclose. There will be set ups to teach the
child what they see and hear, and to teach the child to trust outside
adults to tell them their reality.
A typical set up will go like this:
The adult will hold an object such as an orange in their hand, and
ask the young child, about age two or three, “what is this?”.
The child will quickly respond, “oh, an orange!” The child
will be shocked, and told, “no, it’s an apple.”
The child will be confused, because what they are looking at is obviously
an orange. It is the color orange, smells like an orange, looks like
an orange. The question will be repeated. The child may answer again,”
an orange,” and will be shocked again. Finally, the child, unsure
and not wanting to be punished, will say, “an apple,”
and be praised.
The purpose of this exercise is to teach the child to not trust their
own reality, and look to outside adults or leaders to tell them what
reality really is.
That is the basis of denial: the person learns to not trust their own
reality, because of punishment and fear when they have spoken the truth.
Alters will be created as the child grows, whose purpose is to deny
the cult abuse. If any leakage or breakthrough occurs, the denial alter’s
job is to create a plausible explanation: it was a nightmare, a book
the person read, a movie they saw, etc. These alters will read and quote
literature that refutes SRA. THESE ALTERS OFTEN BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE
SAVING THE LIFE OF THE SURVIVOR. They have been told that if the survivor
remembers, and believes the abuse, the survivor will be killed, or the
denial alter will be severely punished or shattered for not doing their
job. These parts have a vested interest in their job: they believe their
very existence and they body’s survival, depend upon them.
Suggestions:
Arguing with a denial alter will not work, since they are not motivated
by logic, but fear. A better approach is to ask them what they fear
if the person remembers. This will open up the deception and lies that
were ground in. They may be protecting the survivor from suicidal alters
behind them, who are programmed to kick in if denial is broken through.
Allowing them to vent their concerns, and enlisting the aid of helpers
or cognitives who do not have suicidal or denial programming will help.
Showing them reality in a gentle way, allowing them to “listen
in” on others who share will go a long way.
Some denial is the natural consequence of self protection from the
horrors of abuse; not all denial is programming. But if denial is constantly
blocking therapy, and causing it to come to a complete standstill; if
the person becomes highly suicidal every time denial is set aside briefly,
then the possibility needs to be considered. Safety, inner cooperation,
and patience will go a long way in decreasing denial. As denial backs
down, you can expect an immense amount of grieving as the truth is realized.
Denial protected the survivor from the horrendous pain of the truth,
and should be let go of extremely slowly and cautiously, with plenty
of support during the grieving stage.
Core splits
Core splits are intentional traumatic splits created from the core
personality.
The core may be literally “splintered” by overwhelming
psychological and physical/spiritual trauma. The trauma needed to create
a core split must be very early and psychologically devastating. Fetal
splits may occur, but they are rarely a core split; instead, the core
creates an alter, but remains.
Core splits are done between the ages of 18 months and three years.
Usually at least one parent or main caretaker is involved in the trauma,
because this creates the psychological devastation necessary to split
the core. Physical trauma alone rarely causes core splits. The torture
is intense and prolonged, until the child collapses. It may be shocking,
stretching, being hung in a high place, or a combination of several
techniques. Being placed in “shock boxes”, or near drowning
are also used.
The techniques that create core splits are also dangerous, since they
can also cause autism if the child cannot endure the programming. When
I was in the cult, I fought to stop core splitting because occasionally
children were lost or the foundational personality was too weakened.
The core may split into two, three, or up to eight splits internally.
Each split will be a piece of the “core child”. The original
core will not resurface after splitting. These splits are used by cult
trainers to be used as templates to create systems within the child.
A core split, or a split from one, will be a strong alter, and can be
re-split many times in the programming process, to create a multifaceted
and diverse system within.
Suggestions
Core splits represent intense foundational trauma. They will be the
basis for later systems, which may be completely dissociated from the
split as time goes on. Work on core splits should go very slowly, and
only late in the therapy process when there is immense intrasystem cooperation.
The survivor will need every internal resource to deal with these traumas,
and plenty of outside therapeutic support.
It may mean hospitalization unless the survivor can keep the trauma
from emerging too quickly, and the therapist and survivor can go extremely
slow.
Other, less dissociated systems and fragments should be integrated.
Acknowledging the abuse cognitively will be the first step in dealing
with core trauma. Letting more dissociated parts grieve about “hearing
about” what happened may come next. Allowing feelings near the
core to come close, a little at a time, with helpers and internal nurturers
offering support will help.
These feelings should be titrated, and looked at a little at a time.
Splits may be different ages, and may need to express themselves in
different ways.
There may be “dream programming”, a “fantasy world”,
or other flight from reality surrounding the core splits, that protects
them from contact with the outside world, which is perceived as brutal
and cold. Parts may be completely disconnected from outside reality
in an effort to buffer pain.
Slow, patient nurturing and reality orientation will help these tremendously
traumatized parts begin to join outer reality. Some parts will always
have been aware of what happened, but won’t care to join the outside
world.
Patience, allowing them to vent, will help most.
Steps of Discipline
Step seven: Not caring
This step will take the child further into a perpetrator role. The
child will be forced to hurt others and prove their ability to not care
during the process.
Step eight: Time travel
The child will be taught spiritual principles of “traveling”
both internally and externally, with set ups, role playing, and guided
exercises reinforced with trauma. The goal will be to reach “enlightenment”,
an ecstatic state of dissociation reached after severe trauma.
Steps nine, ten, eleven
These will involve programming that will vary according to the child’s
future role in the cult. Sexual trauma, learning to dissociate and increase
cognition, decrease feeling will be emphasized in these steps.
Step twelve: ceremony of becoming at age twelve to thirteen, the child
will be formally inducted into the cult and their adult role in a ceremony
of “coming of age”. They will prove this ability by performing
the role/job they have been training for, to the satisfaction of the
trainer and leaders; by undergoing a special induction ceremony. The
ritual and ceremony will be held with other children of the same age,
who are dressed in white and given a prize as acknowledgement that they
have completed the basics of their training successfully.
They will continue to be abused, even as adults, but the major traumatization
and creation of system templates will have occurred by this age. Future
training will refine what was already placed in the child by this age,
or build upon the foundation.
Suggestions
Grieving the abuse, acknowledging the feelings associated with undergoing
the trauma will be important. It will be necessary to deal with perpetrator
guilt, since by this time the child will be a perpetrator, and will
have identified with the adult role models around them. This can be
difficult to do, since perpetration will horrify the survivor when they
remember this. Supporting the survivor, remaining non judgmental, and
encouraging acceptance of these parts is important. Pointing out that
at the time, they saw no other options available will help. Realizing
that perpetrator alters saved the child’s life, and that they
had no other way to act, especially originally, the first time, will
need to be pointed out. The survivor may feel hostile towards, or reviled
by perpetrator alters, but they are the expression of the abuse and
limited choices they were allowed. Grieving being a perpetrator will
take time and caring support by others.
