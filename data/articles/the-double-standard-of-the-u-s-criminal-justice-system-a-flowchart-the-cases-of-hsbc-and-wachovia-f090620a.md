The US Criminal Justice System is one of the more obtuse ones in the world,
with an extremely high rate of incarceration and most citizens being guilty
of at least 3 crimes a day without even knowing it.
We decided to show how the double standard works

examples, the case of HSBC and Wachovia versus the regular Joe is
astounding.
