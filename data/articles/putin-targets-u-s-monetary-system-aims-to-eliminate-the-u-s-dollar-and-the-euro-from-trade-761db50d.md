# Putin Targets U.S. Monetary System - "Aims to Eliminate the U.S. Dollar 
and the Euro from Trade"

The implications for such a move,
though not necessarily immediate, are serious over the
long-term.
That China and Russia are now overtly divesting
themselves of U.S. dollar assets signals a significant paradigm
shift in global trade.
The dollar may be strong today as
panicked global investors rush to the perceived 'safety' of the
U.S.
Treasury assets. But as
the Federal Reserve is left with no
choice but to print trillions more to keep financial markets
from ruin, the creditors who usually buy those assets are drying
up.
There will come a breaking point in
the near future, and when that day comes we will see the
largest monetary collapse in the history of the world.
When the collapse of the dollar
occurs, it will literally and figuratively come like a thief
in the night, and I do mean overnight!
We are all familiar with the
concept of inflation, which is the intentional byproduct of
the Federal Reserve. But I am not just talking inflation,
I'm speaking about hyperinflation which is caused by the
collapse of the value of the currency resulting in runaway
prices.
Here are three examples of how
quickly a currency collapse can occur when a nation's money
when its money no longer holds it value:
1. In Weimar Germany, from
1922-1923, prices doubled every three days.
2. In the modern era, in
Yugoslavia from 1992-94, witnessed prices doubling
every 34 hours.
3. In Zimbabwe, in the two
year period from 2007-2008, prices doubled every 25
hours.
History is replete with examples
of currency collapses and they typically follow very
predictable patterns in which a nation unravels and social
chaos, and many times, widespread violence and even genocide
becomes part of the national landscape.

What will happen when the dollar collapses?
And though such things could never
happen in the "developed" world, we urge our readers to consider
the reality of a scenario that involves a break down of the U.S.
dollar.
We direct your attention to
Venezuela, where we can see
what a total system collapse looks like in real-time:
With
30% of Venzuelans eating
two or fewer meals per day, social unrest is
mounting rapidly in President Nicolas Maduro's socialist
utopia.
As WSJ reports, soldiers
have now been deployed to stem rampant food smuggling
and price speculation, which Maduro blames for triple-digit
inflation and scarcity.
"Due to the shortage of
food
the desperation is enormous," local
opposition politician Andres Camejo said, and nowhere is
that more evident than the trampling
death of an 80-year-old woman outside a state-subsidized
supermarket.
In such a scenario we can fully
expect that our regular
systems of commerce will break down to the point that
essential goods like food, gas and other critical supplies
become unattainable to the masses at almost any price.
Tess Pennington, author of
The Prepper's
Blueprint, explains what happens within three to
five days of the reality of the monetary disaster setting in:
Have you ever heard the saying,
"We're three days away from
anarchy?"
In the wake of a disaster,
that's all you have is three days to turn the crazy train
around before crime, looting and chaos ensue.
In reports during the aftermath
of hurricane Sandy, residents from Staten Island were
pleading for help from elected officials, begging for
gasoline, food and clothing.
Multiple factors contribute to
societal breakdowns including failure of adequate government
response, population density, citizens taking advantage of
the
grid being down and overwhelmed emergency response
teams.
The 3-5 days following a
disaster is the bewitching hour. During this short amount of
time, the population slowly becomes a powder keg full of
angry, desperate citizens.
A good example is the chaos that
ensued in New Orleans following the absence of action from
the local government or a timely effective federal response
in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In such troubled
times, people were forced to fend for themselves and their
families, by any means necessary.
This
timeline of Hurricane Katrina effectively illustrates
"the breakdown," and within three days, the citizens of New
Orleans descended into anarchy, looting and murder .

Anatomy of a Breakdown
It's difficult to imagine a
sustained breakdown across America.
But make no mistake, should the U.S.
dollar every come under attack, and it appears that the opening
salvos have already been fired by Russia and China, then life as
we have come to know it in America will come to a drastic and
near immediate halt.
