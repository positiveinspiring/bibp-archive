The United
Nations warns that global food stores like grains
are depleting at an expediential rate and when combined with failing
harvests, there will be a food crisis in 2013.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
explain
that,
weve not been producing as much as we are
consuming. That is why stocks are being run down. Supplies are now very
tight across the world and reserves are at a very low level, leaving no
room for unexpected events next year.
Since 2010, the FAO have
stated that the rise in food prices is directly correlated to the 80
million people being added to the worlds population annually.
This fact, according to the globalists at the
UN, is beginning to,
tax both the skills of farmers and the
limits of the earths land and water resources.
Added to this problem are the 3 million people
who are moving up the food chain eating more than their share in
gluttonous nations like the United States and China.
The World Bank issued a statement of concern
last month for the coming food shortage due to the drought devastating the
U.S. and Europe.
According to Jim Yong Kim, World Bank group president:
Food prices rose again sharply threatening
the health and well-being of millions of people. Africa and the Middle
East are particularly vulnerable, but so are people in other countries
where the prices of grains have gone up abruptly.
Corn yields in the U.S. have
succumbed to an infection known as aspergillus flavus which causes a
carcinogenic toxin to manifest and renders the corn unfit for human
consumption.
In Iowa, cattle ranchers have reported that
their livestock that ate the corn have died due to toxic nitrate doses.
Nitrate is not toxic to animals; however with
the drought conditions causing a lack of access to water, the animals died
due to complications. For humans, nitrate will
cause blue baby
syndrome and digestive tract cancers.
With an estimated 870 million people in the
Middle East and Africa becoming malnourished, world environmentalists are
saying that the global food supply system is heading toward collapse. Lester
Brown, president of the
Earth Policy
Institute (EPI), asserts that our planets climate can no longer be
trusted and that the demand for food from over-population is breaking the
proverbial straw on the camels back.
Brown says that,
food shortages undermined earlier
civilizations. We are on the same path. Each country is now fending for
itself. The world is living one year to the next.
Brown
predicts that as food supplies are tightening everywhere and
agricultural land is becoming a precious commodity, geopolitical perspective
will shift from energy to necessity.
He foretells of armed aggression focused on
food unrest.
EPI is a foundation begun by Brown that focuses
on influencing the global plan for an environmentally and economically
sustainable world. Part of their goal is to coerce the media, social
consciousness, lawmakers and governments to adhere to their ideals and
examples of how to demonstrate an ecological civilization.
Under the Obama administration, with the
assistance of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) there is a
palatable crisis being created because of mandates for ethanol
production versus necessities for food.
The U.S. investment in
ethanol is a drain on the worlds food stores; which allocates massive
amounts of food to the production of this plant-based fuel for cars instead
of for human consumption.
In April, before the drought crisis in America
began to take its toll on U.S. corn crops, Purdue and Stanford published a
study that predicted with precise accuracy that man-made climate change
would affect corn yields to the extent that a rise in food prices would be
inevitable. They obtained their funding from U.S. Department of Energys
Office of Science.
The study explains with eerie accuracy that due
to man-made climate change,
there could be quite a substantial increase
in yield volatility, and thats due to the increased frequency and
intensity of the high temperatures throughout the Corn Belt.
Confirmed eugenicists Bill and Melinda Gates
have
allocated $17.6 to the UN World Food Program (WFP) to,
provide nutritious food and support
small-scale farmers.
In the end, the Foundation will give $10 million
to the WFP.
Instead of giving the money to the people in
need of food and provisions,
the Gates Foundation will be granting not only
the UN through WFP, but also non-governmental organizations aligned with the
UN such as,
At this years UN Earth Summit Rio+20, goals for
sustainable development in Africa and Asia center on their population
growth, water supplies and food security.
The sub-Saharan and northern regions of Africa,
Latin America, the Caribbean and parts of Asia are of particular interest to
the UN, as stated by UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO).
With the assistance of the UN, corporations have
begun
descending on Africa to aid in the securitization of their natural
resources.
Examples like an $11 million dollar project
funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Cocoa-Cola
Corporation are usurping 50,000 Kenyan and Ugandan smallholders to produce
fruit for Minute Maid, a subsidiary for Cocoa-Cola.
Africa is now the last frontier in terms of
arable land, said James Nyoro, the Rockefeller Foundations managing
director for Africa. With the population growing to 9 billion, the rest
of the world will have to depend upon Africa to feed it.
In February of this year, the Rights and
Resources Initiative, a non-governmental organization was involved with the
UN in a
massive land-grab in Africa which displaced an estimated 500 million
citizens from the sub-Sahara as well as targeted 346 billion acres of
farmland for the purpose of securitizing food production.
According to a 2011
report released by the International Land Coalition, there is a rush by
global networks to acquire land in the sub-Saharan region of Africa by
foreign corporations and governments which is causing environmental and
agricultural devastation along the River Niger in Africa.
The report states:
The siphoning of water for huge areas of
farmland will worsen the already low water levels of the Niger.
The outcome was a,
50 percent diminution of the delta flood
plains land area.
Given that social conflict over resources between
farmers and pastoralists has always been a feature of the Niger Basin,
the Coalition suggests that large-scale irrigation could heighten
tension between local and downstream water users.
In 2007-2008, land grabs by NGOs, multi-national
corporations and international entities were a
direct causation of the food crisis in developing nations by Saudi
Arabia and South Korea.
President
Barack Obama supports the United
Nations land
grab
scheme with the installation of his $3 billion plan to securitize
Africas food supply and agricultural farms.
Obama wants to use Africa as a
base for growing the worlds food supply, under his controlled initiatives.
