There's no question John McCain is getting a free ride from
the mainstream
press. But with the power of YouTube and the blogosphere, we can provide an
accurate portrayal of the so-called Maverick. We can put the brakes on his
free ride!
Since we first released The Real McCain-John McCain vs. John McCain
(far below video) a year ago, our REAL McCain series
has garnered close to 2 million views, with over 13,000 comments and tens of
thousands more in petition signatures! Clearly, John McCain's record is
something the public wants to discuss, and yet the corporate media is doing
NOTHING to present the truth. We feel obliged to continue countering the
mainstream media's love of McCain.
And so we thought it was high time for a
sequel: The Real McCain 2.

Something Went Wrong
With McCain's Face On National TV
by
goodboydc
October 01, 2008
There's now slow-motion video making it painfully clear that something is
wrong.
In the post below, we showed a scene that just took place in which McCain
was momentarily confused on stage, not knowing where to go. We posted the
video because it was funny. But Joe just realized that literally seconds
before McCain became confused on stage, his face twitched or convulsed
twice.
Look at the above video.
It happened twice. First in a rather major way at 5 seconds, then more minor
at 10/11 seconds. You can see McCain's left eye twitch closed, and at the
same time, the left corner of his lip twitched upwards - it's especially
pronounced in the 4th photo above. What is going on with McCain's health?
This isn't normal. And it happened right before he became confused and
couldn't figure out how to get off the stage.
At some point, the corporate media needs to do its job and stop being a
bunch of politically correct wimps. We just saw - AGAIN - something go
physically wrong with McCain's face. It's not the first time it's happened,
we documented it before. But the media refuses to ask McCain what is wrong
with him because, well, it's not clear why.
McCain is 72 years old, was tortured for five years (which couldn't have
done wonders to his health), and then had FOUR bouts of serious melanoma.
His health is an issue, and he has never fully released his medical records
in a way that permits anyone to actually peruse them correctly - he only
permitted reports to look at each page of his medical records for about 10
seconds before switching to another page. And no one was permitted to copy
or take with any of the records. They're now back under lock and key.
Note the second twitch/convulsion right before McCain finished and became
befuddled. Since the corporate media isn't doing its job, and the McCain
campaign won't release his medical records, we have to turn to the public.
Would any doctors out there please give an analysis of what could be causing
this?
Here's something interesting from Wikipedia:
Several conditions can cause a facial paralysis, e.g., brain tumor, stroke,
and Lyme disease. However, if no specific cause can be identified, the
condition is known as
Bell's Palsy.
Another theory being discussed in the
comments is a mini-stroke, commonly known as a TIA.... a "transient ischemic
attack."
CITIZEN CAIN - JOHN McCain's "Spiritual Guide": DESTROY
ISLAM
Aug 5, 2008
from
Metacafe Website
Rev. John Hagee, the McCain supporter who said God created
Hurricane Katrina to punish New Orleans for its homosexual "sins."
Well now meet Rev. Rod Parsley, the
televangelist megachurch pastor from Ohio who hates Islam.
According to David Corn of Mother Jones,
Parsley has called on Christians to wage war against Islam, which he
considers to be a "false religion." In the past, Parsley has also railed
against the separation of church and state, homosexuals, and abortion
rights, comparing Planned Parenthood to Nazis. John McCain actively
sought and received Parsley's endorsement in the presidential race. McCain
has called Parsley "a spiritual guide," and he hasn't said whether he shares
Parsley's vicious anti-Islam views.
That's because the mainstream media refuses to
ask. And so, we've taken matters into our own hands, joining Mother Jones to
present the truth about McCain's pastor. Since the media won't question
McCain about his deeply bigoted pastor, it's up to you to call attention to
this issue. Make McCain's pastor problem a major story by forwarding this
video to your family, friends, and colleagues.
We can't let McCain get away with aligning
himself with a religious leader who's called for an all-out war on Islam,
someone who draws no distinctions between Muslims and violent Islamic
extremists.
SEN. JOHN McCAIN - THE ULTIMATE "RHINESTONE HERO"
by Devvy
August 26, 2004
from
NewsWithViews Website
Arizona Senator John McCain has been making big hay with the media
lately regarding the anti-Kerry "Swift Boat" ads (search) calling for the
White House to denounce them. McCain, never one to shy away from the camera,
carries his own baggage from Viet Nam.
This two part series was originally
published in my old newsletter, The Power Educator, with permission
from Ted Sampley of the U.S. Veteran Dispatch, July 1995. McCain has
always had his own problems with Viet Nam veterans.
The government's media apparatus has basically
given him a free pass.
Part I
August 26, 2004
John McCain the second-term Republican senator
from Arizona and former Navy pilot captured and held prisoner during the
Vietnam War, is a fraud, collaborator, and danger to the security of the
United States because he is being black-mailed by the communist Vietnamese.
He is a phony - a "rhinestone hero."
While a prisoner of war, McCain was treated as a "special prisoner," with
privileges including being given his own private and affectionate nurse.
McCain's treatment as a "special prisoner" is a contradiction to his much
publicized image of a great war hero who was severely tortured and kept in
solitary confinement for long periods of time because he refused to break
during interrogation.
Ted Guy, a former Air Force Colonel held 5 1/2 years by the Vietnamese and
McCain's senior ranking officer (SRO) in the POW camp, told the U.S. Veteran
Dispatch he cannot remember the communists ever laying a hand on McCain.
Other sources have told the U.S. Veteran Dispatch that the Vietnamese are
holding as much as fifty hours of film footage secretly taken of McCain
during the time his KGB-trained handlers had him isolated from other U.S.
prisoners of war.
Some of the film, according to the sources, is of McCain receiving special
privileges during the time he claims he was being tortured and held in
long-term solitary confinement.
The sources say interrogators have candid camera footage of McCain with the
nurse, who allegedly supplied him with more than just medical attention
during those lonely days and nights in so-called solitary confinement.
In June 1992, Trung Hieu, a film director from the Vietnamese
Ministry of Culture and former North Vietnamese Army photographer, told the
U.S. Veteran Dispatch that Hanoi does have considerable film of POW McCain
and some of it involves a Vietnamese woman.
Trung, who worked during the war as an official photographer in North
Vietnam's POW camps, was in the United States seeking political asylum when
he told the U.S. Veterans Dispatch about the film.
Trung also said that during the war he photographed a nearly intact B-52
bomber, which was shot down at the edge of an air field near Hanoi in
December 1972. He said the North Vietnamese traded the B-52 and some of its
surviving crew members to the Soviets for three MIG-23 jet interceptors.
Trung said the Soviets wanted to interrogate the crew about U.S. electronic
warfare.
Trung said he took movie film of an American F-111 fighter bomber also shot
down in 1972. He said the F-111 capsule, along with the surviving crew, was
sent to China. The crew, according to Trung, was later returned to Hanoi.
McCain, who was a member of the 1992 Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA
Affairs, argued emotionally during the hearings that "none of the returned
U.S. prisoners of war released by Vietnam were ever interrogated by the
Soviets."
Trung has said Hanoi has a large, secret vault containing shelves loaded
with POW/MIA related film, which it has never allowed the U.S. government to
view.
Gene Brown, who was employed by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
for a period of time in 1992 and 1993, told the U.S. Veteran Dispatch that,
while in Hanoi, he had been inside a vault which contained wall-to-wall film
and that there appeared to be approximately 50 hours of film about McCain.
Brown, who was in Hanoi secretly working for the DIA under the code name
"Druid Smoke" succeeded in smuggling nearly 4,500 photographs out of Hanoi
by buying them from Communist officials with money supplied by the DIA. The
photos, most of which had never been seen by the U.S. government, were taken
during the Vietnam War and depicted, Americans killed in the war and the
wreckage of many U.S. aircraft.
To avoid embarrassing the communists, USG officials declared the release of
Brown's black market photographs "important progress" and "unprecedented
cooperation" toward resolving the POW/MIA issue and publicly thanked the
Vietnamese for their cooperation.
Garnett Bell, a 30 year employee of DOD and former chief of the U.S.
office for POW/MIA Affairs in Hanoi, told the U.S. Veteran Dispatch that he
had actually seen some film footage of McCain taken by the Vietnamese when
McCain did not know he was being filmed.
Last month the United Press International (UPI) quoted the
Cambodian Khmer Rouge accusing McCain of being a "Vietnamese Agent."
"Who is John McCain?" the rebel group asked
rhetorically in a radio broad-case monitored in Bangkok. "He is
Vietnamese. He has a Vietnamese wife and Vietnamese children. He is an
American by nationality, but he is a Vietnamese agent..."
McCain the collaborator
From the first days of McCain's captivity, he seriously violated the
Military Code of Conduct, which outlines the basic responsibilities and
obligations of members of the Armed Forces of the United States who have
been captured by the enemy.
According to documentation obtained by the U.S. Veteran Dispatch, not only
did POW McCain promise to give the communists "military information" in
exchange for special hospital care not ordinarily available to U.S.
prisoners, but he also made numerous anti-war radio broadcasts.
Article V of the Code of Conduct is very specific in declaring that U.S.
military personnel are required to avoid answering questions to the utmost
of their ability and to make no oral or written statements disloyal to the
United States and its allies or harmful to their cause. Any violation of
this code is considered collaborating with the enemy.
The following is McCain's own admission of collaboration in an article he
wrote, printed May 14, 1973 in U.S. News and World Report:
"I think it was on the fourth day [after
being shot down] that two guards came in, instead of one. One of them
pulled back the blanket to show the other guard my injury. I looked at
my knee. It was about the size, shape and color of a football. I
remembered that when I was a flying instructor a fellow had ejected from
his plane and broken his thigh. He had gone into shock, the blood had
pooled in his leg, and he died, which came as quite a surprise to us - a
man dying of a broken leg. Then I realized that a very similar thing was
happening to me.
"When I saw it, I said to the guard, 'OK, get the officer.'"
"An officer came in after a few minutes. It was the man that we came to
know very well as "The Bug." He was a psychotic torturer, one of the
worst fiends that we had to deal with. I said, 'OK, I'll give you
military information if you will take me to the hospital.'"
The Admiral's son gets "special treatment"
McCain claims it was only a coincidence
that, about the same time he was begging to be taken to a hospital, the
Vietnamese learned his father was Admiral John S. McCain, Jr., commander of
all U.S. forces in Europe and soon-to-be commander of all U.S. forces in the
Pacific, including Vietnam.
McCain does concede he survived because the Vietnamese learned who his
father was, rushing him to a hospital where his wounds were eagerly treated.
The former POW admitted in the U.S. News and World Report article that the
Vietnamese usually left other U.S. prisoners with similar wounds to die, not
wishing to waste medication on them.
McCain pointed out,
"there were hardly any amputees among the
prisoners who came back because the North Vietnamese just would not give
medical treatment to someone who was badly injured. They weren't going
to waste their time."
McCain has failed to mention what he has
confided to another U.S. prisoner that since the Vietnamese felt they had in
their hands such a "special prisoner" and propaganda bonanza, a Soviet
surgeon was called in to treat him.
The communists figured that because POW McCain's father was of such high
military rank, McCain was of royalty or the governing circle. They bragged
that they had captured "the crown prince."
His communist handlers believed McCain, because he came from a
"royal-family", would, when finally released, return to the United States to
some important U.S. military or government job. Communist Interrogators and
psychological warfare experts drooled at the thought.
McCain's handlers were very much aware that he would be under great
psychological pressure not to do or say anything that would tarnish the name
of his famous military family.
In fact, the communists considered that to be the key to eventually breaking
and then "turning" their "special" prisoner, using blackmail if necessary.
According to U.S. government documents, within a week of POW McCain being
transferred to the Gai Lam military hospital, the Hanoi press began quoting
him giving specific military information.
One report dated Nov. 9, 1967 read,
"The question of the correspondent, McCain
answered: 'My assignment in to the Oriskany, I told myself, was due to
serious losses of pilots, which were sustained by this aircraft carrier
(due to raids on the North Vietnamese Territory (VNA), and which
necessitated replacements. From 10 to 12 pilots were transferred like me
from the forest to the Oriskany. Before I was shot down, we had made
several sorties. All together, I made about 23 flights over North
Vietnam.'"
In that article, McCain was further quoted
describing the number of aircraft in his flight, information about rescue
ships, and the order of which his attack was supposed to take place.
Six weeks after McCain was shot down, he was taken from the hospital and
delivered to Room No. 11 of "The Plantation" and into the hands of two other
POWs, who helped further nurse him along until he was eventually able to
walk by himself.
Afterwards, his handlers isolated "special prisoner", McCain from other
American prisoners and made him the target of intense psychological
programs.

Part II
August 29, 2004
McCain continuously violates the Code of Conduct
In direct violation of the Code of Conduct, McCain, who was supposedly in
solitary confinement, met with and was interviewed by several foreign news
reporters and political delegations, including many high-ranking North
Vietnamese leaders, such as Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, North Vietnam's Minister of
Defense and national hero.
Through the Freedom of Information Act, the U.S. Veteran Dispatch acquired a
declassified Department of Defense (DOD) transcript of an interview
prominent French television reporter Francois Chalais had with McCain.
Chalais told of his private interview with POW McCain in a series titled
"Life in Hanoi", which was aired in Europe. In the series, Chalais said his
meeting with McCain was "a meeting which will leave its mark on my life."
"My meeting with John Sidney McCain
was certainly one of those meetings which will affect me most profoundly
for the rest of my life. I had asked the North Vietnamese authorities to
allow me to personally interrogate an American Prisoners. They
authorized me to do so. When night fell, they took me - without any
precautions or mystery - to a hospital near the Gia Lam airport reserved
for the military (passage omitted).
The officer who receives me begins: "I ask
you not to ask any questions of political nature. If this man replies in
a way unfavorable to us, they will not hesitate to speak of
`brainwashing' and conclude that we threatened him.
"This John McCain is not an ordinary prisoner. His father is none other
than Admiral Edmond John McCain, commander in chief of U.S. Naval forces
in Europe. (passage omitted).
Another declassified DOD document reports an
interview between POW McCain and Dr. Fernando Barral, a Spanish psychiatrist
who was living in Cuba at the time. The interview was published in the
Havana Gramma in January 1970.
According to the DOD report, the meeting between Barral and McCain took
place away from the prison at the office of the Committee for Foreign
Cultural Relations in Hanoi. During that interview, POW McCain sipped coffee
and ate oranges and cakes with his interrogator.
During that interview, McCain again seriously violated the Code of
Conduct by failing to "evade answering questions" to the "utmost" of his
ability when he, according to the DOD report, helped Barral by answering
questions in Spanish, a language McCain had learned in school.
On Dec. 7, 1969, McCain was moved out of isolation and into the "Hanoi
Hilton" with other prisoners of war.
McCain is Hanoi's leading advocate
Today, McCain, who claims he was brutally tortured by the Communist
Vietnamese, focally emerged as Hanoi's leading advocate for normalized
relations with the United States.
McCain's high-profile and unrelenting support for a government that brutally
tortured and murdered his fellow POWs is causing POW/MIA Family members and
fellow Vietnam veterans to question the senator and his motivations.
They ask what drives McCain, who owes his public life to the tag "former
POW," to work so hard for Hanoi and so diligently to discredit any
possibility, in fact the probability, that Hanoi held back live U.S.
prisoners of war after the 1973 prisoner release.
The POW/MIA families point out that they worked hard during the Vietnam War
to secure McCain's freedom when he was being held by the Communists and the
families want to know why he is now betraying them in their efforts to get
answers about their missing loved ones.
None of the senators who served on the 1991-92 Senate Select Committee on
POW/MIA Affairs were as vicious in their attacks on POW/MIA family members,
veterans, and activists than McCain.
During the POW/MIA hearings, Frances Zwenig, the $118,000-a-year
staff director of the Senate Select Committee, reported to McCain that she
was told by the Vietnamese, during a July 1992 meeting with the Vietnamese,
that something had to be done about the POW/MIA activists who were opposing
lifting the U.S. imposed trade embargo against Vietnam.
Not long after, McCain started demanding that the Select Committee
investigate the activists, prompting one observer to ask,
"Are the Vietnamese now directing the
affairs of the Senate Select Committee?"
McCain accused the POW/MIA families and
activists who openly challenged the U.S. government's POW/MIA policy, of
fraud. In his attacks he said,
"The people who have done these things are
not zealots in a good cause. They are criminals and some of the most
craven, most cynical, and most despicable human beings to ever run a
scam."
McCain took the lead in the Senate and demanded
a U.S. Justice Department investigation of the activists. The Justice
Department did investigate and found no reason to charge any of the POW/MIA
activists.
When one of McCain's former interrogators, Col Bui Tin, a former
Senior Colonel in the North Vietnamese Army, testified before the Senate
Select Committee, McCain did not display that same "pit bull" inclination to
attack as he did for the POW/MIA families and activists.
Col Tin told the committee that because of his
high position in the Communist Party during the war, he had the right to
"read all the documents and secret telegrams from the Politburo" pertaining
to American prisoners of war. He said not only did the Soviets interrogate
some American prisoners of war, but they treated them very badly.
During a break in the hearing, McCain warmly embraced Bui Tin as if he were
a long lost brother. McCain fought a hard and successful campaign to get the
U.S.-imposed trade embargo against Vietnam lifted, despite the opposition of
all major veteran's organizations, the two POW/MIA family groups, and the
majority of the Vietnamese Americans in this country.
The veterans want to know why McCain, the
"conservative" politician, takes such strong stand for the Vietnamese
communists and against such patriotic groups.
John Sidney McCain, III
John McCain was born in the
Panama Canal Zone on August 29, 1936. His father was Admiral John McCain
II, who became commander-in-chief of the Pacific forces in 1968. Admiral
McCain later ordered the bombing of Hanoi while his son was being held there
as a prisoner of war. His grandfather was Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., the
famous commander of aircraft carriers in the Pacific under Admiral William
F. Halsey in World War II.
McCain's early years were spent in various places on both the east and west
coats. He attended Episcopal High School Alexandria, VA., and graduated from
the U.S. Naval Academy in June 1958.
His grades in electrical engineering were "satisfactory", although he had
numerous demerits for breaking curfews and infractions and he graduated
fifth from the bottom of his class.
Nevertheless, in spire of his low class standing, his request for training
as a Navy pilot was granted, no doubt his father's rank of admiral and
family history playing part in the decision.
After qualifying as a Navy pilot, McCain was shipped to Vietnam.
On his 23rd mission over North Vietnam on Oct 26, 1967, McCain was shot down
by a surface-to-air missile.
To relate the event, McCain later recalled that he was flying right over the
heart of Hanoi in a dive at about 4,500 feet, when a Russian missile the
size of a telephone pole came up - the sky was full of them - and blew the
right wing off my Skyhawk dive bomber.
It went into an inverted, almost straight-down
spin.
"I pulled the ejection handle, and was
knocked unconscious by the force of the ejection - the air speed was
about 300 knots. I didn't realize it at the moment, but I had broken my
right leg around the knee, my right arm in three places and my left arm.
I regained consciousness just before I landed by parachute in a lake
right in the center of Hanoi, one they called the Western Lake. My
helmet and my oxygen mask had been blown off.
"I hit the water and sank to the bottom.....I did not feel any pain at
the time, and I was able to rise to the surface. I took a breath of air
and started sinking again."
After bobbing up and down, McCain said he was
eventually pulled from the water by Vietnamese who swam out to get him.
He said a mob gathered on shore and that he was bayoneted in the foot and
his shoulder was smashed with a rifle butt. He said he was put on a truck
and taken to Hanoi's main prison.
The "Rhinestone Hero"
In Congress, McCain's peers touts him as
a great war hero. On occasion, the press categorizes McCain as one of the
most tortured prisoners of the Vietnam War. Neither is true. He was never
brutally tortured and, by his own admission, he collaborated with the
communists.
When one totals McCain's 23 missions over North Vietnam, times the number of
minutes he was actually over enemy territory (approximately 20 to 35 minutes
per mission), McCain's total time over Vietnam before being shot down, was
about 10 1/2 hours.
For those 10 1/2 hours over Vietnam, McCain, the Admiral's son, was awarded
two Silver Stars, two Legions of Merit, two Distinguished Flying Crosses,
three Bronze Stars, the Vietnamese Legion of Honor and three Purple Hearts
averaging over one hero medal per hour.
Compare McCain's 10 1/2 hours of combat and 13 medals to that of a U.S.
infantry private who spent 365 days trudging through South Vietnams jungle
and mud, facing death on a daily basis. He was lucky to leave Vietnam with a
simple good conduct ribbon.
Compare McCain's record as a prisoner of war to that of Army Special Forces
Captain "Rocky" Versace, who was captured by Vietnamese
Communists (Viet Cong) on Oct. 29, 1963 in South Vietnam and who resisted
his captors to the end. Very few, if any, in Congress know about Capt.
Versace.
He spent two years chained in a bamboo cage and endured almost daily torture
by the Vietnamese Communists. Capt. Versace continuously frustrated his Viet
Cong interrogators by refusing to obey demands that he denounce America and
accept the Communist Philosophy of revolution.
He told his captors as they were dragging him to
an interrogation hut,
"I am an officer of the United States Army.
You can force me to come here, you can make me sit and listen, but I
don't have to believe a damn word you say."
The Viet Cong decided that day to take no more
resistance from Rocky Versace. A few days later, one order of Viet Cong
leader Vo Van Kiet, today Vietnam's prime minister and McCain's friend,
Versace was dragged from his filth-ridden, mosquito-infested bamboo cage for
the last time and forced to kneel with his forehead pressed into the jungle
mud. Cap. Versace was then shot in the back of the head.
McCain doesn't talk about MIAs Capt. Rocky Versace, from
Norfolk, VA., or Sgt. Kenneth Roraback of Fayetteville, N.C., or Army
Sgt. Harold Bennett of Perryville, Ark., who were all ordered
executed by his friend, "Butcher" Kiet, according to reports.
Compare McCain, the POW hero, to another fellow prisoner of war, Marine
Capt. Donald Cook, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.
Capt. Cook was awarded our nation's highest award for valor because, during
his years of captivity, he jeopardized his own health by sharing his meager
supply of food and scarce medicines with other U.S. prisoners who were
sicker.
He became legendary for his refusal to betray
the military Code of Conduct. On one occasion, Vo Van Kiet's Viet
Cong cadre put a pistol to Capt. Cook's head, demanding that he denounce the
United States. Capt. Cook resisted and calmly recited the nomenclature of
the parts of the pistol, giving the Communists nothing.
The Viet Cong were so infuriated at Capt. Cook's resistance that they
isolated him from other American prisoners. They intentionally denied him
much needed food and medicine. Like Capt. Versace, Capt. Cook disappeared
and was never heard from again. Today, Hanoi claims Capt. Cook died as a
result of malaria and that they do not know where his remains are buried.
McCain discourages any talk about Capt. Versace, Sgt. Roraback, Sgt.
Bennett, and Capt. Cook.
To talk about such patriots would require the United States to demand
the return of their remains, or, at the very least, records of their deaths.
If those MIAs are proven dead and their remains returned, then McCain's
friend, Vo Van Kiet, would be forced to explain the holes in the back of
their skulls and why he had ordered the POWs murdered.
John McCain is NO Hero. He violated the military Code of Conduct
and willfully collaborated with the Vietnamese, Soviets, and Cubans.
It is not yet publicly known just how much he collaborated and what kind of
favors he received in return. Those in the U.S. government that do know are
not talking.

The group Vietnam Veterans Against McCain attacks Senator John McCain's
heroism as a POW in the Vietnam conflict; this is making some waves in the
news due to McCain's presidential candidacy.
The documentary "Missing, Presumed Dead the
Search for America's POWs" however focuses more on Senator John McCain
successfully blocking the release of classified POW/MIA documents.
Here is an excerpt from that documentary.

BARACK OBAMA - THE WOLF
IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING
by
THEYLIVE2012
February 16, 2008
I was getting curious as to why Obama, has been dethroning the heir
apparent, Hillary Clinton, and gaining such a wide following. You can't even
turn on the news without seeing his face blasted on every news channel.
A man who can mesmerize the masses, talking of standing up to organized
money, to lobbyists, special interests, but his whole political apparatus is
made of members of the same globalist organizations that most of Bush's
administration is made up of, except this time the stated agenda is CHANGE &
YES WE CAN
The mantle is being passed, and it seems that Henry Kissinger's associate,
and one worlder Zbigniew Brzezinski, along with
David Rockefeller, the co-founders/directors
of the
Trilateral Commission, a group an institution that openly declares
itself a supranational government on their website, is going to have their
very own puppet to play with, as well as massive powers that Bush signed
onto.
The change that is coming, comes in the form of doubled foreign aid, carbon
taxes, poverty taxes in the form of 0.7% of the GDP, and that's just for
starters, increasing the size of the military, expanding the theatres of
operations, the expansion of surveillance... who even knows what will happen
between now and then
The open dismantling of the US, the merging of
the North American Union, and
really the dawn of the
RFID tracking age. A President of the world's dying
superpower will have to oversee the transition into biometric scanning and a
cashless society
Do you think anyone will by it from Bush? Of course not, but you can be
absolutely sure Obama will sell this system to everyone, and grab those guns
as fast as he can.
I've spent much time watching his speeches, listening to his words, watching
his mannerisms, bringing crowds to fever pitch frenzy, with a media campaign
behind him that no money can buy, thanks to links and connections that
almost ensure his victory as Democratic nominee, having Hilary retain a Dick
Cheney type position.
If you think you put up with tyranny under
the Bush administration, you can
just imagine what's ahead...
TO THOSE WHO THINK I'M PRO-MCCAIN, I BELIEVE THAT ALBINO NUTJOB IS JUST
AS BAD, IF NOT WORSE THAN OBAMA, AND THAT'S HOW THE HAND IS PLAYED, CALLING
FOR ENDLESS WAR, 100 YEARS IN IRAQ JUST TO ASSURE THAT THE PUBLIC GETS
OBAMA...
CAN'T YOU SPOT A FALL GUY WHEN YOU SEE ONE?

Obama Calls For New World Order In Berlin
by
jettercat
July 25, 2008
The media hailed Obama's Berlin speech in front of
hundreds of thousands yesterday as a call for a vision of America as part of
a "new world order".
Excerpts from
The International Herald Tribune:
"I come to Berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before," Obama said,
confronting the delicate issue of campaigning abroad. "Tonight, I speak to
you not as a candidate for President, but as a citizen - a proud citizen of
the United States, and a fellow citizen of the world."
Obama was warmly embraced by the German press, which frequently referred to
his aura, or as the newspaper Bild put it in Thursday's paper, the
"political pop star."
"Yes, there have been differences between America and Europe," Obama said.
"No doubt, there will be differences in the future. But the burdens of
global citizenship continue to bind us together.
A change of leadership in
Washington will not lift this burden. In this new century, Americans and
Europeans alike will be required to do more - not less. Partnership and
cooperation among nations is not a choice; it is the one way, the only way,
to protect our common security and advance our common humanity."
BILDERBERG ORDERS END TO OBAMA/CLINTON

Article from "Bilderberg
Group orders end to Obama-Clinton contest":
The elite
Bilderberg Group, which is convening this year at the Westfields
Marriott hotel in Chantilly, Virginia, has officially ended the Democratic
presidential contest between Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama.
The two presidential hopefuls were summoned to the Bilderberg Group annual
meeting, where they were both informed that Obama would play the part of the
Democratic candidate this election year.
Clinton is reported to have begged
Lord Rothschild
and
David Rockefeller
- both senior level Bilderbergers - for forgiveness following her poor campaign performance this past year.
"Mrs. Clinton was very upset," said a male prostitute who services some of
the male Bilderberg members. "She said David Rockefeller was behind the push
to oust her from the race.
She had apparently been promised a comeback
effort by Lord Rothschild like the kind that was granted to her husband Bill
Clinton in the early 1990s, when it looked like he was going to be out of
the presidential race."
Rothschild represents U.K. interests in the Bilderberg Group, while
Rockefeller handles U.S. concerns. Sources say that Rockefeller overruled
Rothschild on the Clinton matter.
Republican candidate John McCain is also scheduled to appear before Bilderberg soon, and will be given a script on how he should campaign
against Obama. Bilderberg is expected to choose which candidate
- McCain or
Obama - will be the next U.S. president sometime during the next two days.
The Bilderberg Group was formed in the 1950s to consolidate the countries of
the world into regions to be controlled by the world's elite, as a precursor
to a global government. It often interferes directly in democratic countries
in order to further this agenda.
Republican Congressman Ron Paul of Texas
was effectively knocked out of the presidential race by
the Bilderbergers,
shortly after the elite group ordered the U.S.
mainstream news media not to
report on him.
The Last Tragicomedy of The Global Elite: The
Child - The Messiah

'He ventured forth to bring light to the
world'.
This is something you won't see on CNN, or MSNBC. It kind of
gets right to the heart of all the Obama worshiping going on.
Gerard
Baker Zings Barack Obama 'He Ventured Forth to Bring Light to the
World' a Satirical Classic by Mark Whittington,
published Jul 25,
2008.
Gerard Baker, the American editor and
the assistant editor of the Times of London, has answered the question:
Can one laugh at Barack Obama?
His piece, entitled 'He ventured forth to
bring light to the world,' resoundingly says,
'Yes we can!' 'And it came to pass, in
the eighth year of the reign of the evil Bush the Younger (The
Ignorant), when the whole land from the Arabian desert to the shores
of the Great Lakes had been laid barren, that a Child appeared in
the wilderness,' Gerard Baker writers.
One might as well call the piece, 'The
Gospel of Barack the Messiah.' Forget about depicting the Democratic
Presidential candidate as a Muslim Imam or any of that rubbish.
Gerard Baker's piece surpasses even the segment in the JibJab video that
depicts Obama riding a unicorn down a rainbow in a Disney cartoon
universe.
Gerard Baker's piece captures neatly the
attitude toward Barack Obama of the mainstream media and Obama's
teenaged followers, the ones who faint in the aisles upon Barack Obama's
very word.
'From there the Child went up to the
city of Jerusalem, and entered through the gate seated on an ass.
The crowds of network anchors who had followed him from afar cheered
'Hosanna' and waved great palm fronds and strewed them at his feet.'
Barack Obama has been called 'the Messiah'
and 'Obamessiah' by observers of the political scene who have looked
upon Obama and his arrogant megalomania, his promises to lower the
oceans and tear down every wall.
Gerard Baker has finally put all that
into words what a lot of people are thinking when they see Barack Obama
make an inane speech and then see people, including the media, slobber
over him like besotted teenage girls.
Here the Obama Child brings peace to the
Middle East just by showing it the beneficence of his countenance. There
the Obama Child heals the sick at a distance (even the uninsured) and
causes oil to gush forth from the ground without even having to drill.
No one can stop him.
Not the evil
George Bush the Younger (the Ignorant),
not 'the conniving Hillary, wife of the deposed King Bill the Priapic
and their barbarian hordes of Working Class Whites', and not even 'the
imperial warrior Petraeus'...

La Misma Cosa Pero Con Diferente Calzón...

Por favor, no se dejen engañar más.
No crean que un moreno simpático con
mucho carisma va a cambiar o hacer la revolución en un país como los Estados
Unidos, donde el verdadero poder lo detiene una poderosa oligarquía oculta
detrás del poder político de fachada.
Las declaraciones en una confrontación
TV de ambos aspirantes a la presidencia estadounidense es en ese sentido muy
instructivo: defienden los intereses de los verdaderos patrones del país y
sus verdaderos objetivos: más guerra, más intromisión, más lobby militar-industrial,
más rapiña, más imperialismo pero esta vez con guante para ser más elegantes.
Los candidatos a la presidencia de Estados Unidos, el demócrata
Barack Obama
y el republicano John McCain evitaron llamar a Rusia "imperio del mal", pero
criticaron la operación militar emprendida por el Kremlin contra Georgia.
Durante el segundo de tres debates televisados, previos a las elecciones el
próximo 4 de noviembre, el moderador preguntó a los candidatos si estaban de
acuerdo en el calificar a Rusia "imperio del mal", como lo hizo en 1983 el
ex presidente Ronald Reagan en relación a la Unión Soviética.
"Creo que ellos (los rusos) demuestran una conducta maligna, pero debemos
comprender que Rusia no es la antigua Unión Soviética, aunque todavía tienen
impulsos de nacionalismo, y esto es peligroso", respondió Obama.
"Puede ser", respondió a la pregunta McCain con una sonrisa. "Todo de depende de la forma en que responderemos a Rusia, también depende
de muchas cosas. Si respondo "si" a la pregunta, esto quiere decir que de
nuevo comenzamos la guerra fría y si respondo "no", esto puede interpretarse
en que pasamos por alto la conducta de Rusia", subrayó McCain.
A juicio del candidato republicano, Estados Unidos debe sostener relaciones
con Rusia de tal forma que Moscú entienda que se encuentra frente a "Estados
Unidos muy fuerte y decidido, que sabe defender sus propios intereses y los
intereses de otros países del mundo".
Añadió que en las relaciones ruso estadounidenses,
"la energía va a ser un
gran factor. Georgia y Ucrania son puertas de entrada a Europa. Esa es una
de las razones por las que están en nuestra esfera de interés", explicó McCain.
Por su parte, Obama dijo que su país debe ayudar a Estonia, Letonia y el
resto de países de la antigua órbita socialista,
"especialmente Georgia que
se encuentra al borde de grandes dificultades económicas".
Obama apoyo la tesis de su oponente republicano al afirmar que el aspecto
energético es un asunto clave en las relaciones entre EE.UU. y Rusia.
"Si logramos disminuir nuestro consumo de energía, será menor la cantidad de
petrodólares en disposición de ellos (rusos) para causar daños en el mundo.
Esto fortalece a nosotros y debilita a ellos (rusos) en asuntos como
Georgia", subrayó Obama.
