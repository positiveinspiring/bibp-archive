# National Infrastructure Bank - Another Trilateral Ripoff?

Obamas slick 2010 Labor Day speech that promised an additional Federal
stimulus for a sick economy, was a ringer. Here's why - buried in the $50
billion infrastructure stimulus promise is the following statement:
It sets up an Infrastructure Bank to
leverage federal dollars and focus on the smartest investments.
Infrastructure Bank? Smartest investments?
Obama
would have you think that this was his brainchild, but it is not. It will,
however, effectively centralize another key area of our economy, namely
infrastructure, into a government run enterprise that mostly benefits the
private capital of the global elite, and in particular, members of the
Trilateral Commission.
For a historical perspective, we need to look back to August 2007 during the
Bush administration when
S.1926 was introduced (National
Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007) by Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) and
Chuck Hagel (R-NE).
The failed bill provided for an independent government entity (think FDIC,
for instance) with a five-member board appointed by the President and
confirmed by the Senate.
In 2009, the Obama Administration promoted similar legislation introduced
into the House as H.R.2521 by Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) to,
"facilitate efficient investments and
financing of infrastructure projects and new job creation through the
establishment of a National Infrastructure Development Bank, and for
other purposes."
The Administration was so certain that this
would pass (it has not) that the 2010 budget included appropriations for a
National Infrastructure Bank. (See
Investing for Success, Brookings
Institution, p.11)
Dodd himself
called S.1926 a,
unique and powerful public-private
partnership that would offer a fresh solution to the challenge of
rebuilding the nations infrastructure.
It was originally to be funded by a $60 billion
bond issue which would be then leveraged with private capital. Obamas new
twist is to forget the bond and just give $50 billion of taxpayer money
directly to kick - start the NIB.
A public-private partnership in this context is reminiscent of the World
Bank's Public-Private Partnership in Infrastructure program (PPPI)
whose objective,
"is to provide capacity building to help
client governments create the proper environment to develop successful
and sustainable PPPs, as well as to provide technical assistance to
client countries in issues related to PPP program design, development,
and implementation."
However,
the World Bank explains their agenda more
fully:
"The program initially focuses on core
infrastructure sectors - energy, water, transport, and
telecommunications - and will progressively cover the main social
sectors such as education, health and housing."
This may suggest the intended meaning of "other
purposes" mentioned above in
H.R.2421. Obama made no mention of NIB
revenue bonds that would be used to pay back loans with by tolls, fees, etc.
Most importantly, all infrastructure
spending/lending/appropriations would circumvent Congress forever more. In
fact, the whole affair would be off-agency, meaning that the accounting for
it would not show up in the national budget, but would potentially create a
huge contingent liability for taxpayers down the road.
So, who were the policy wonks behind
the NIB and S.1926 in 2007? (You know it
wasnt Dodd or Hagel!)
Fortunately, the press release on Dodds own
website gives full credit:
Last year, Senators Dodd and Hagel signed
on to a set of Guiding Principles for Strengthening Americas
Infrastructure developed by the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) Commission on Public Infrastructure, said CSIS President
and CEO John Hamre.
These principles were established to recommend changes to rebuild
Americas decaying infrastructure. CSIS is proud to have helped
stimulate this important initiative.
Proud, indeed!
This traitorous and globalist think tank was originally established by a
founding member of
the Trilateral Commission, David Abshire.
The current CSIS board is stacked with notorious
Trilateral Commission members like,
This supposedly "bi-partisan" S.1926 was
subsequently co-sponsored by twelve other senators including Hillary
Clinton and, you guessed it, then-Senator Barrack Hussein Obama.
This is one more piece of evidence that both
Clinton and Obama operate solidly within the Trilateral orbit.
There is no argument that the U.S. infrastructure is a shambles. The
American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that it would take $1.6
trillion to fix it. The final tab will be much higher.
Of course, neither the Feds nor the states have that kind of money but the
Trilateral Commission has repeatedly proven its ability to sucker the
taxpayers into paying for the Commission's global trade schemes
in this
case, the final implementation of NAFTA (North American Free Trade
Agreement) trade routes throughout the U.S.
As reported in my detailed 2005 report,
Toward a North American Union, NAFTA
was created in the first place exclusively by members of the Trilateral
Commission:
In recent years, NAFTA's infrastructure grid has
been developed and plotted by an organization known as the North America
Corridor Coalition, Inc. (NASCO).
The recently updated NASCO web site shows a plethora of infrastructure plans
(below image) that are tightly integrated with the implementation of NAFTA,
which will undoubtedly be brought into play through the new National
Infrastructure Bank.
Citizen revolts in Texas and Oklahoma in
2007-2008 were successful at smacking down the infamous
Trans-Texas NAFTA Super-Corridor along
I-35.
This likely will not happen again.
Such pesky citizens and their state governments will be rendered irrelevant
with decisions being made at the national level by a private board that will
operate behind closed doors with little or no public input or recourse.
The
Brookings Institution explains it this way:
"Multi-jurisdictional projects are neglected
in the current federal investment process in surface transportation, due
to the insufficient institutional coordination among state and local
governments that are the main decision makers in transportation.
The NIB would provide a mechanism to
catalyze local and state government cooperation and could result in
higher rates of return compared to the localized infrastructure
projects."
(ibid, Brookings Institution)
Thus, where local and state government
cooperation is lacking, the NIB would "catalyze" projects and make them
happen in spite of such "insufficient institutional coordination".
In short,
the NIB scheme sets up the American
taxpayer for yet another pillage and plunder operation at the hands of
the Trilateral Commission
and their global elite cronies. When projects fail, taxpayers will pay for
that as well.
S.1926 did not pass in 2008 and H.R. 2521 did not pass in 2009, but now that
Obama has put it at the top of his agenda, it will likely pass before
December 31, 2010.
Or
Obama could simply create it by fiat through
an Executive Order!
How much more Trilateral abuse can the taxpayer's Treasury endure before the
whole economic system in the U.S. just collapses from exhaustion? No one can
say for sure, but it seems awfully close to this writer!
Unfortunately, mid-term elections will do absolutely nothing to reduce the
influence of this nefarious and unelected group that quietly hijacked the
U.S. Executive Branch as far back as 1976 with the election of James Earl
Carter and Walter Mondale, both of whom were early members of the
Trilateral Commission.
That and every administration since then has
been stocked full of Commission members, all eager to promote
Trilateral-style globalism and demote U.S. sovereignty and prosperity.
