A new report circulating in the Kremlin today
prepared for President Medvedev by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
says that the United States, in 2010, continued its headlong descent into
becoming one of the most feared police states our modern World has ever
seen.
The term police state as used in this report describes a government that
exercises rigid and repressive controls over the social, economic and
political life of its population.
A Police State typically exhibits elements
of totalitarianism and social control, and there is usually little or no
distinction between the law and the exercise of political power by the
executive.
The inhabitants of a police state experience restrictions on their mobility,
and on their freedom to express or communicate political or other views,
which are subject to police monitoring or enforcement. Political control may
be exerted by means of a secret police force which operates outside the
boundaries normally imposed by a constitutional state.
According to this report, the United States has
created so many new laws they have created a virtual
web of entrapment that has turned nearly all of Americas
ordinary citizens into criminals without them even knowing it.
The United States further
announced this past week that they are
expanding their already massive armed police presence into their Nations
hotels, train stations and shopping malls in a move that rivals the Nazis
placement of Gestapo forces into all aspects of German life, and which,
according to former CIA Director Michael Hayden, is due to their
governments fear of their own citizens who
he claims,
"want death and destruction
and blood and mayhem".
To the fear among
the
elite classes ruling the United States of their own citizens
wanting death and destruction is made readily apparent when viewed in the
light of the shocking statistics of what that once great Nation has truly
become,
such as:
-
3 million American families foreclosed
upon
-
30 million American people in need of
employment
-
43 million American people on food
stamps
-
52 million American people in poverty
-
59 million American people without
healthcare
-
239 million American living paycheck to
paycheck
-
$144 billion in Wall Street bonuses
-
$13 Trillion in investible wealth being
held by just 1% of US population
To the vast majority of the American people
being allowed to know the true state of their Nation it now appears to be
impossible as their mainstream press has been reported to be nothing more
than journalism of appeasement, corruption, smoke and mirrors failing on a
daily basis to keep their citizens informed of the most important events
occurring around them.
Even worse is the shocking news that one of the top reporters of the
Washington Post (one of the major mainstream newspapers in the US), named
Ezra Klein, stated on the MSNBC television news network this past week
that the United States Constitution,
has no binding power on anything and is
confusing because it was written more than 100 years ago.
The views of Klein and the Washington Post that
the US Constitution was no longer in effect were further echoed by the
Obama
regime this week when they announced that
just a single complaint
against any American citizen, by anyone, is sufficient to put them on their
governments terrorist watch list, a prospect for these innocent people made
more frightening by the announcement this month that the Homeland Security
Department was partnering with their Nations largest retailer, Wal-Mart,
to begin running checkout stand videos encouraging these people to become
informers on their friends and neighbors.
Note: One of the first
victims of this new US citizen spying program is reported to be the
Grana
Family of Lincoln, Nebraska who after a complaint was made
against them were brutalized by over 20 armed police, a frightening
prospect, indeed, as these so called American peace officers are even
allowed to shoot and kill deaf people (below video) who do not immediately obey their
orders, and as evidenced this past summer in Seattle, Washington.
Equally as worse as their descent into police state tyranny are the American
people not being told by their mainstream media that since the great stock
market collapse of 2008, their entire financial system (including billions
in bonuses to Wall Street bankers) has becoming nothing more than a gigantic
con game as new research done by top analyst Charles Biderman shows
no one can figure out who has been buying US stocks for the past 2 years,
leading to one to conclude the only buyer of recourse is the US government
itself.
Not just to the US government throwing Trillions of Dollars into a
bankrupt stock market is the American peoples only danger, either, as
new reports are showing their Medicare retirement system is in danger of
total collapse due to its being under funded by a staggering
$23 Trillion, a
grim situation sure to grow even worse as beginning tomorrow, January 1,
2011, 10,000 people a day, for the next 19 years, will begin claiming their
benefits as the
Baby Boom Generation (those born between 1946-1964) begins
reaching the retirement age of 65.
Most grim to read in this report, however, is the Ministries stating that
the reason behind the American governments massive suppression of their
people is due to the growing fears of what
the year 2012 holds for them as
near total Solar Chaos is set to, perhaps, change our entire World forever
and which they want to be prepared for as anarchy will undoubtedly ensue.
To how catastrophic this Solar Chaos event will be was detailed this past
year by Dr.
Clara Y. Yatini, of Indonesias National of Aeronautics
and Spaces (LAPAN) Solar and Space Division, who equated the
blasts due to hit our Earth in 2012 from the Sun
as being equal to 100 million hydrogen bombs.
So concerned have the Americans become of this once in a lifetime (above
video) event
that NASA issued its first warning in 2006 of this apocalyptic solar
outburst (but which some scientists believe will
begin occurring in 2011)
and issued another one earlier this year, and as
we can read:
NASA has previously warned in a study that
a solar storm on the surface of the sun could hit earth in the coming
years causing mass destruction of our power grids.
But unlike the
coronal mass ejection that provided views of the aurora borealis at
lower latitudes than normal earlier this month, this type of solar storm
could be so powerful it may wipe out the power grid on the entire
planet.
Even more concerning are new reports surfacing
from one of our Worlds top solar scientists about this event, and as we can
further read:
Astrophysicist Alexei Dmitriev says
that both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 satellites reveal that our sun, as
well as our entire solar system, is now moving into an interstellar
energy cloud. Opher, a NASA Heliophysics Guest Investigator from George
Mason University says this interstellar energy cloud is turbulent.
Dmitriev explains that this cloud of energy is exciting the atmospheres
of our planets and especially our sun. As this interstellar energy cloud
continues to excite/charge the sun, it causes the sun to become more
active, resulting in greater output from the sun. IE: Bigger and more
frequent solar storms and CME's resulting in
the Carrington effect.
This interstellar cloud of electrical energy
is also absorbed by the Earth, and scientist have found that it results
in more earth quakes, all while dramatically effecting our weather here
on earth.
When asked how long will it take our sun to pass through this
interstellar energy cloud, Dr. Dmitriev replied,
"I don't know. But If I had to guess, I
would say somewhere between two thousand to three thousand years."
This interstellar cloud is a wispy band of
charged particles through which our solar system is slowly moving
through.
When Dr. Dmitriev was asked what are the implications of all this for
earth he replied,
"Global catastrophe! Not in tens of
years from now, but in ones of years",
...in that this global catastrophe is
basically right around the corner setting the stage for NASA's latest
solar storm warning 2012-2013.
To Dr. Dmitrievs assertion that this solar
event will cause the disruption of all of our Solar Systems planets weather
patterns there seems to be no doubt as aside from the massive weather chaos
now occurring all over our Earth, new reports are showing an outbreak of an
enormous storm on Saturn too.
To our Sun being able to influence planetary weather has been further
documented by British Meteorologist Piers Corbyn, and of whom we can
read about as reported by the
Sydney Morning Herald:
Back in November, when the Met Office was
still doing its "mild winter" shtick, Corbyn said it would be the
coldest for 100 years. Indeed, it was back in May that he first
predicted a snowy December, and he put his own money on a white
Christmas about a month before the Met Office made any such forecast.
He said that the Met Office would be wrong
about last year's mythical "barbecue summer", and he was vindicated. He
was closer to the truth about last winter, too.
He seems to get it right about 85 per cent of the time and serious
business people - notably in farming - are starting to invest in his
forecasts. In the eyes of many punters, he puts the taxpayer-funded Met
Office to shame. How on earth does he do it? He studies the Sun.
He looks at the flow of particles from the Sun, and how they interact
with the upper atmosphere, especially air currents such as the jet
stream, and he looks at how the Moon and other factors influence those
streaming particles.
Even more frightening is that the Sun has not
only been causing massive weather chaos (below video), but is also reported to new be
affecting matter too, and as we can further read:
For months mounting fear has driven
researchers to wring their hands over the approaching solar storms. Some
have predicted devastating solar tsunamis that could wipe away our
advanced technology, others voiced dire warnings that violent explosions
on the surface of the sun could reach out to Earth, breach our magnetic
field, and expose billions to high intensity X-rays and other deadly
forms of cancer-causing radiation.
Now evidence has surfaced that something potentially more dangerous is
happening deep within the hidden core of our life-giving star:
never-before-seen particles - or some mysterious force - is being shot
out from the sun and it's hitting Earth.
Whatever it is, the evidence suggests it's affecting all matter.
Alarmed physicists first became aware of this threat over the past
several years. Initially dismissed as an anomaly, now frantic scientists
are shooting e-mails back and forth to colleagues across the world
attempting to grasp exactly what is happening to the sun.
Something impossible has happened. Yet the "impossible" has been proven
to be true. Laboratories around the globe have confirmed that the rate
of radioactive decay - once thought to be a constant and a bedrock of
science - is no longer a constant.
Something being emitted from the sun is
interacting with matter in strange and unknown ways with the startling
potential to dramatically change the nature of the very Earth itself.
And if you are thinking that our Sun causing
massive weather chaos and changing matter are all that is happening you
couldnt be more mistaken as new reports coming from
the High Arctic are
stating that where it should be totally dark it is now light and pointing to
our Earths Axis beginning to shift, but which Western scientists, of
course, blame on Global Warming.
Important to note, also, in this report was the announcement by Israeli
scientists this week that a new type of human being over 400,000 years old
had been discovered, and which if proven true would upset all accepted
theories of evolution and origins of human society.
The importance of this Israeli discovery, and when added to the Solar Chaos
soon to be upon us, sheds new light on the theories of the Russian-born
American independent scholar
Immanuel Velikovsky, who in his seminal 1950 book Worlds in
Collision detailed our Earths ancient past that surprisingly mirrors what
is soon to face us all
and overturning of everything.
Though Velikovsky and his theories were
thoroughly skewered by the Western
scientific establishment, it is important to remember that the great Italian
probability-theorist,
Bruno de Finetti, speaking in 1964 about
Velikovsky's case, compared the scientific complex to a despotic and
irresponsible Mafia.
Velikovsky arrived at a body of radical inter-disciplinary ideas, which
might be summarized as:
Planet Earth has suffered natural
catastrophes on a global scale, both before and during humankind's
recorded history.
There is evidence for these catastrophes in the geological record (here
Velikovsky was advocating Catastrophist ideas as opposed to the
prevailing Uniformitarian notions) and archeological record. The
extinction of many species had occurred catastrophically, not by gradual
Darwinian means.
The catastrophes that occurred within the memory of humankind are
recorded in the myths, legends and written history of all ancient
cultures and civilizations.
Velikovsky pointed to alleged concordances in the accounts of many
cultures, and proposed that they referred to the same real events. For
instance, the memory of a flood is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, in the
Greek legend of Deucalion, and in the Manu legend of India. Velikovsky
put forward the psychoanalytic idea of "Cultural Amnesia" as a mechanism
whereby these literal records came to be regarded as mere myths and
legends.
The causes of these natural catastrophes were close encounters between
the Earth and other bodies within the solar system - not
least what were now the planets Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, and Mars, these
bodies having moved upon different orbits within human memory.
To explain the celestial mechanics necessary to permit these changes to
the configuration of the solar system, Velikovsky thought that
electromagnetic forces might somehow play a greater role to counteract
gravity and orbital mechanics.
Some of Velikovsky's specific postulated
catastrophes included:
-
A tentative suggestion that Earth had once
been a satellite of a "proto-Saturn" body, before its current solar
orbit.
-
That the Deluge (Noah's Flood) had been caused by proto-Saturn's
entering a nova state, and ejecting much of its mass into space.
-
A suggestion that the planet Mercury was involved in the Tower of Babel
catastrophe.
-
Jupiter had been the culprit for the catastrophe that saw the
destruction of the "Cities of the Plain" (Sodom and Gomorrah)
-
Periodic close contacts with a cometary Venus (which had been ejected
from Jupiter) had caused the Exodus events (c.1500 BCE) and Joshua's
subsequent "sun standing still" incident.
-
Periodic close contacts with Mars had caused havoc in the 8th
and 7th centuries BCE.
Now to what will actually occur in the future it
is not in our knowing, other than, of course, to mention that as all of the
Worlds governments are preparing for a massive something to occur by
2012
(including the once free United States throwing away its Constitution and
replacing it with a police state, and the creation of the
Doomsday Global Seed Vault in Norway) it
might behoove everyone to begin the coming New Year by making plans for
survival in World soon to be in total chaos.
