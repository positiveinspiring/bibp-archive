Timothy Geithner is a rising star
within the membership of the Trilateral Commission: He is highly educated,
has extensive regulatory experience, and is wiling to bend, break or obscure
the rules to favor his global elite bosses.
In November 2008 when Geithner was President of the NY Federal Reserve, just
before becoming Obama's Secretary of the Treasury, recently discovered
e-mails reveal that Geithner and the NY Fed pressured the bailed-out AIG
into keeping it's mouth shut about which banks were receiving taxpayer funds
in exchange for toxic assets known as "credit swaps."
(This story was made possible by
copies of e-mails between
Fed
and AIG officials that were recently secured by California Representative
Darrell Issa - R-CA)
Furthermore, the NY FED and AIG then conspired to officially hide the event
when AIG was required to make a regulatory filing to the SEC on December 24,
2008: The Fed crossed out the reference on its records and AIG excluded the
facts on their filing.
In November 2008, the NY Fed was officially in charge of negotiations
between AIG and those banks that were "to big to fail."
More than a dozen banks, including Goldman
Sachs and Societe Generale SA, received payments of $62.1 billion
from AIG for worthless mortgage-backed contracts. What a sweetheart deal
they got, too: 100 cents on the dollar!
No wonder that Geithner wanted to hide the details.
On behalf of the taxpayer, AIG was supposed to negotiate steep discounts for
these worthless contracts. Yet, in October, the NY Fed had ordered AIG to
not seek discounts from the banks, which directly dinged taxpayers for at
least $13 billion.
Around November 24, 2008, when Geithner learned that
Obama
intended to nominate him for the top Treasury job, he was officially recused
from matters dealing with specific companies. In other words, he ran like a
rabbit and insulated himself from any further involvement that might be
discovered during his Senate confirmation hearings.
Geithner successfully obscured his still-hidden dealings with AIG and was
subsequently confirmed to be the head watchdog and guardian of America's
money center.
This level and sophistication of corruption is without parallel in the
history of the world. It is calculated, brazen and blatant.
Remember that in September 2008, then-Secretary of the Treasury
Henry "Hammerin'
Hank" Paulson demanded $700
billion in bailout funds from Congress with no strings attached.
Paulson literally extorted the money by claiming
that America would completely collapse in days or weeks if he didn't get the
money authorized immediately. The fact that Paulson was formerly CEO of
Goldman Sachs, a company with heavy representation in the Trilateral
Commission, didn't deter his demands nor Congress' total capitulation to
them.
U.S. taxpayers should demand that Congress immediately start impeachment
proceedings to remove Geithner as Secretary of the Treasury. Perhaps the
threat of a publicly-broadcast Senate trial would motivate Obama to fire him
before other incriminating evidence could be presented.
From a layman's perspective, criminal charges facing Geithner might start
with something like these:
-
Perjury - lying to and withholding
information from the U.S. Senate while under oath
-
Theft - illegally diverting billions of
Treasury funds to selected global banks
-
Conspiracy to conceal a criminal act -
coercing AIG to file false regulatory statements with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC)
-
Malfeasance - commission of an unlawful
act in the course of an official capacity
The August Review has long pointed out
and documented cases where members of the Trilateral Commission have
discovered ways to raid the U.S. Treasury for private gain.
A few of these articles include:
It should be reiterated that all bankers and
corporate executives are not greedy and corrupt.
In fact, the vast majority are loyal Americans,
law-abiding, family oriented and civic-minded. The small group of
internationalists who are members of the Trilateral Commission are the polar
opposite of mainstream America and live and operate as if they are above the
law and any accountability to the people of the countries where they have
business interests.
From its founding in 1973 by
Zbigniew Brzezinski and
David Rockefeller, the Trilateral
Commission has never had more than 400 members at any one time; of those
members, only about one third are directly connected to banks and global
corporations. Since Commission membership is drawn from Europe, Asia and
North America, U.S. membership is obviously quite small.
The August Review's 2009 article
Obama: Trilateral Commission Endgame was not widely criticized
when it reported that about 12 percent of the U.S. membership had been
appointed by President Obama to top-level positions in his administration:
-
Timothy Geithner
-
Susan Rice
-
Gen James Jones
-
Thomas Donilon
-
Paul Volker
-
Adm. Dennis Blair
-
Kurt Campbell
-
James Steinberg
-
Richard Haas
-
Dennis Ross
-
Richard Holbrooke
Another Trilateral member, Robert Hormats was
appointed later in 2009.
If America is to survive this pandemic of high-level corruption, then
this Trilateral Commission hegemony must first be jettisoned from all
positions and departments of our government; merely electing another party
in November 2010 will not accomplish this.
