# Two President Who Died Defying the Rothschilds

"Most Americans, even the college educated,
know next to nothing about our monetary system.
They would be surprised
to know that the U. S. Treasury makes 22½ cents on each quarter it
mints, as it only costs 2½ cents to mint this coin.
Similar profits are realized on every other
coin (with the possible exception of the penny) simply because the U.
S., when minting coins, is simply following its Constitutional
responsibility - the government alone has the right to print or mint our
money.
This right cannot be delegated any more than
the right to declare war or collect taxes.
If this is how the Constitution was intended to operate, why then do we
allow a private group of foreign bankers to issue our currency (which
they create out of thin air) and then "loan" it to the U. S. at
perpetual interest, an interest that cannot be extinguished?
Two of our Presidents asked that same
question and look what happened to them.
President Lincoln dared to have the
U. S. issue its own greenbacks, backed with the full faith of the
government, and bypassed the central bankers, avoiding any interest
payments to them. For this patriotic act he was killed by John Wilkes
Booth, a Rothschilds agent and contract killer, who was later spirited
away to England where he lived out his life comfortably on a pension
provided by the Rothschilds bankers.
The greenbacks were immediately stopped and
called in and redeemed at a ridiculous low price set by the central
bankers. One point should be made here: The Rothschild bank financed the
North and the Paris branch of the same bank financed the South, which is
the real reason the Civil War was ignited and allowed to follow its
long, and bloody course.
The more Americans that dies, the more money
the Rothschild bankers made.
In our times this control of the issuance of our currency is in the
illegal hands of the Federal Reserve, called the Fed, and the principal
owner of the Fed's "Class A" stock is - you guessed it -
the Rothschild family.
The other president brave enough to oppose
the banker barons, whose worth was now in the trillions, was President
John F. Kennedy.
This first Catholic president of our country
enjoyed a deep-roots popularity - a charisma not enjoyed by most
presidents. The Kennedy administration was so confident that it had the
support of most voters that it ignored the Jewish lobby as the Kennedy
brothers (John and Robert, his Attorney General) knew it was unnecessary
to have the complete backing of every Jew in the U. S.
President Kennedy pledged himself to what was the best for America and
cared not how the greedy bankers of the Fed felt. JFK, like Lincoln in
the 1860's, dared to have the U. S. Treasury issue U.S. Dollars, not
Federal Reserve notes, and placed them into circulation without paying
interest to any bankers, just as spelled out in the U.S. Constitution.
This alarmed the owners of the Fed like a fifty point tremor on the
Richter Scale. This must cease at once.
The Fed bankers found themselves facing an intolerable
situation, one which defied them and at the same time, one which they
could not publicly complain without letting the cat out of the bag. Any
complaint by the Fed would put it in a very bad light. The public would
soon be aware of the gigantic scam the Fed has gotten away with since
1913.
This scam allowed the Fed to avoid all
income taxes and even audits.
Their response was evident at Dealy Plaza in Dallas."
