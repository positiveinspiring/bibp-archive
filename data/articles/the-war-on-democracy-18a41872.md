John Pilger's 2007 documentary explores the historic and current
relationship of Washington with countries such as Venezuela, Bolivia and
Chile.
Pilger claims that the film,
"...tells a universal story... analyzing
and revealing, through vivid testimony, the story of great power behind its
venerable myths. It allows us to understand the true nature of the so-called
war on terror."
According to Pilger, the film's message is that the greed
and power of empire is not invincible and that people power is always the
"seed beneath the snow".
Pilger interviews several ex-CIA agents who purportedly took part in secret
campaigns against democratic countries and who he claims are profiting from
the war in Iraq.
He investigates the
School of the Americas in the U.S.
state of Georgia, where General Pinochet's torture squads were reportedly
trained along with tyrants and death-squad leaders in Haiti, El Salvador,
Brazil and Argentina.
This is a film that should be shown in History classrooms throughout the
states and the world. Pilger aptly displays the American government's
involvement in manipulating Latin America's leadership over the past 60
years or so.
The focus on Venezuela for the first 40 minutes of the film is an
interesting change from what we see in
mainstream media.
An unabashed
socialist, Chavez has thrown out American control in Venezuela, and has gone
a long way in convincing his neighbors to do the same. However, the beauty
of this film is much more than its discussion of Venezuela.
Pilger goes
through the history of several countries other Latin American countries
weaving them into the bigger picture, thoroughly explaining many of the
important details. Its rare to find such a comprehensive history of US
involvement in Latin America.
Pilger tries establish how the system has
evolved from physical control to financial control in today's era.
Pilger
has mastered obtaining great interviews.
For example, in this film he interviews the head former head of CIA involvement in Latin America as well
as interviews an American nun who was tortured in Guatemala in 1989.
