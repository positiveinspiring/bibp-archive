The Yatsenyuk regime's anti-terrorism operations in the southern and eastern
oblasts (region) of Ukraine are really a use of martial force against
Ukrainian civilians opposed to the coup-installed regime in Kiev.
Predominately peaceful Ukrainian citizens opposing the coup leaders and not
"armed separatists" have been the main target of the regime's militias.
The discourse about "pro-Russian" separatists is a misleading attempt to
hide the real nature of the protests against the regime, which is opposition
to a coup.
The main issue is one of anti-coup protesters versus a junta and
not separatists and federalists versus Kiev.
To refer to the junta in Kiev
as the government of Ukraine is to reject or ignore its illegality.
Welcome to Ukraine Nulandistan
Wherever the U.S. government says it is promoting democracy and freedom, as
U.S.
Assistant-Secretary of State
Victoria Nuland professes about Ukraine, there
has been,
-
destruction
-
impoverishment
-
sectarianism
-
fighting
-
death
Welcome to post-coup Ukraine or Nulandistan.
It follows the precedents and
traditions of destabilization and violence honored by U.S. officials like,
Arseniy Petrovych Yatsenyuk, who has illegally taken the post of Ukrainian
prime minister with the support of the U.S. and European Union, was never
favored by the many of the authentic protesters in
Euro-Maidan or even the
grassroots members of his allies.
When, without any election or public
discussion, he was arbitrarily given the office of prime minister, many in
the Euro-Maidan protest booed him and some even cried "bullet to his head."
His party boss, the infamously corrupt Yulia Volodymyrivna Tymoshenko, was
booed too after she arrived.
In reality, Yatsenyuk and the other Ukrainian
politicians like the ultra-nationalist
Svoboda's Oleh Tyahnybok,
appropriated the hopes and dreams of the Ukrainians that were protesting
against not only the Ukrainian government of Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych,
but the entire corrupt Ukrainian political establishment.
Hiding behind the
protesters, Yatsenyuk and Tymoshenko's Batkivshchyna Party used the militias
of their ultra-nationalist political allies to launch a violent coup in
Kiev.
There is no functioning democracy in Ukraine and, with the full support of
the European Union and the U.S. government, free speech inside Ukraine is
under attack by the new regime and its thugs.
Yatsenyuk's coup-installed
regime has cracked down on media freedoms, sent the Ukrainian military and
security forces to attack anti-coup protesters under the pretext of NATO-backed
anti-terrorism operations, and started purges and witch hunts all over
Ukraine.
This started with the head of the National Television Company of
Ukraine, Aleksandr Panteleymonov, being threatened and beaten into resigning
by Svoboda deputies Igor Miroshnynchenko and Andrey Ilyenko.
A atmosphere of intimidation and bullying is the new order of the day in
Nulandistan and politicians opposing the regime are regularly threatened and
beaten, some to the point of near death. Intimidation and violent tactics
have also been used to force Ukrainian politicians and civil servants to
resign or hand over power across Ukraine.
Inside the Verkhova Rada or Ukrainian Parliament any of the remaining
deputies who dare to speak against the regime and its policies are silences
and beaten up.
This is the U.S.-supported freedom of speech that has been
brought to Ukraine, Nuland-style.
For example, senior deputy Petro Symonenko
has been caught on film being pushed and prevented from speaking, just for
daring to condemn the use of the Ukrainian military and security forces
against civilian protesters by Yatsenyuk's regime.
Before being silenced, Symonenko made the key point of noting how the ultra-nationalists were
serving foreign interests and not the national interests of Ukraine and
actually dividing the Eastern European country.
The senior Rada deputy's
party offices have also been burned, like those of other political parties
in Ukraine opposing the coup.
Again, welcome to Nulandistan: brought to you
by,
...and a whole host of other U.S. tentacles.
Since they took power, the so-called Euro-Maidan "democrats" of the Yatsenyuk regime began killing those Ukrainians that opposed them or
protested against them.
In the process the Yatsenyuk regime is denying them
the rights that Arseniy Yatsenyuk, and the Euro-Maidan movement claimed
legitimized their coup and violent takeover of power in Kiev.
The House of Trade Unions Massacre in Odessa
In the famous port city of Odessa, on the coast of the Black Sea, the
Yatsenyuk regime tried to create sectarian provocation by allowing a
football match between Chernomorets Odessa and Metalist Kharkov, knowing
that thousands of ultra-nationalist regime supporters would flock into
Odessa for the match on May 2, 2014.
After the match the regime supporters
held a rally sanctioned by the regime-installed local authorities where they
started yelling "knife the Russians" using derogatory language.
Then what
appeared to be anti-coup activists, which either support federalization or
separation, wearing St. George's Ribbons and red bands on their sleeves
confronted the regime supporters, which led to a violent confrontation in
Odessa.
In retrospect, it has become clear that these thugs were really undercover
agents and agent provocateurs. Some of the riot police and security forces,
which were sent by the regime in Kiev from outside Odessa, were also were
wearing the same red bands around their sleeves and associating with the
fake anti-coup activists.
After the fake anti-coup activists, which are
being called the "third party" in retrospect, disappeared the pro-coup side
attacked the unrelated and peaceful anti-coup activists that were near
Odessa's House of Trade Unions.
When the anti-coup activists ran inside the
building for safety, it was set ablaze with Molotov cocktails.
The police
watched as the pro-coup side attacked and killed the peaceful activists in
House of Trade Unions while ambulances and fire trucks were prevented from
saving many of the people inside that burned.
There is video evidence that shows Svoboda and Euro-Maidan supporters firing
on the people inside the House of Trade Union with guns while others are
killing people inside the building (see the photographs above).
A man who
called presented himself as sotnik Mykola, a leader of Euro-Maidan, is even
caught on tape firing into the building at people trying to escape the fire.
A pregnant women was taped screaming for help before she was strangled to
death by a regime supporter wearing a white and blue jacket (see the first
figure).
One of the ultra-nationalist supporters of the Yatsenyuk regime
that was in Odessa during the attacks proudly wrote about the murder of the
anti-coup activists in
her Facebook page.
"My jacket smells of burned rubber and it is stained with blood. On the one
hand, there is horror, when I think of the faces of the dead people, on the
other hand, there is pride, and there is nothing you can do about it," she
wrote (see figure below).
Russia's Perviy Kanal (Channel One or First Channel) network would use the
publicly available YouTube footage about the clashes in Odessa to point out
what happened in Odessa.
Their important observations about the lead-up to
the clashes would be reported by RT International in English for
international audiences.
Tatyana Ivananko, a
survivor of the attack from the
anti-coup activists camp in Odessa, would tell RT International's Ukrainian
journalist Alexey Yaroshevsky in a in-depth interview that the,
She also confirmed that
there were no foreign nationals among their ranks and that the agent
provocateurs of the "third party" were not involved with her group
whatsoever.
TheYatsenyuk Regime's Phony Anti-Terrorism Operations Are a Smokescreen
There has been a siege on Donestsk Oblast by the coup-installed regime in
Kiev. Unarmed Ukrainian civilians were killed in Mariupol by orders of the
Yatsenyuk regime on May 9, 2014.
Raw footage from Mariupol shows how unarmed
Ukrainian civilians were killed in the name of phony anti-terrorism
operations by order of the Yatsenyuk regime in its efforts to gain control
in the parts of Ukraine that do not recognize the illegal February coup that
ousted the government of Ukraine.
More Ukrainian civilians were killed on May 10, 2014, when voting in a
referendum was suppose to take place in several of Ukraine's oblasts located
in an area of Ukraine that is controversially called Novorossiya for
historical and sociological reasons.
Albeit skirmishes did take place
between the regime and armed resistance fighters in such places as Slavyansk,
the U.S.-backed Yatsenyuk regime killed Ukrainian civilians in this region
when they tried to exercise their democratic rights to vote peaceful in the
referendum.
For example, instead of allowing the inhabitants of Krasnoarmeysk, in Donetsk Oblast, to vote on their future, the
U.S.-backed
junta sent its militias to prevent the people there from freely voting. This
was done under the pretext of anti-terrorism operations.
The U.S.-backed anti-terrorism
operations are really a smokescreen aimed at hiding the regime's motives to
disrupt the referendum.
The regime is using the so-called National Guard of Ukraine to force its
will on its opponents. What is important to note is that this National Guard
was created in March 2014 by the coup-installed government to secure their
hold on power.
The militia has incorporated sections of the same ultra-nationalist
groups that helped violently oust the legal Ukrainian government in Kiev in
February 2014.
In other words, many of the same armed men that stormed
Ukrainian government offices in a coup are now acting in an official
capacity. Moreover, albeit the National Guard is officially categorized as
the reserve force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, it is under the
jurisdiction and control of the Interior Ministry.
The reason for this is,
because the Ukrainian military is not loyal to the coup-installed regime in
Kiev.
The irregular National Guard, which has ultra-nationalist gunmen that
are loyal to the regime integrated into its ranks, on the other hand is
dependable for the coup leaders and more than willing to do the regime's
dirty work, like killing unarmed civilians, that many members of the
Ukrainian military would refuse to do.
The Yatsenyuk Regime's Predisposition to Commit Atrocities and Crimes in
Ukraine
The Yatsenyuk junta and its supporters were itching to use force against
those opposing them.
The discourse about "pro-Russians" and, even, Russian-speakers
is misleading. The real nature of the opposition in the southern and eastern
portions of Ukraine is opposition to an illegal government installed through
a foreign-back coup.
Calls for local autonomy, federalization, separation,
or reunification with Russia are all byproducts of this.
As early as March 10, 2014, Euro-Maidan supporters like the Ukrainian
businessman Gennady Balashov began to say publicly that the protesters in
the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine should be killed. Balashov also
called for the blockage of natural gas from Russia to the the countries of
the European Union and for deliberate attempts to provoke the Russian
Federation.
He candidly discouraged any dialogue and called for bloodshed
and ethnic cleansing, more properly termed as genocide, in places like
Crimea, Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk, and Donetsk. Anyone that opposes the coup-installed
regime in Kiev, he clarified should be murdered without mercy.
This includes
those wearing the orange and black St.George's Ribbon, which is a ribbon
that is displayed to commemorator the end of the Second World War (or the
Great Patriotic War, as it is called in Ukraine and Russia) and the defeat
of Nazi Germany, since it has become the distinguishing mark of the anti-coup
protesters in Ukraine who view the U.S.-supported February 2014 coup as the
reemergence of the threat of fascism.
Balashov stated:
"We must block the pipeline. We must not allow the trade of
natural gas. Only this can stop the invaders. We must block the pipeline and
let them send Alpha to shoot everyone there.
These people are on foreign
territory. Crimea, Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk are Ukrainian cities.
If
they wear the St. George ribbon, if they tear down our flag, we must shoot
them in the head because they are the enemy. We should not talk to them
or educate them
"
Gennady Balashov's comments echo those of the infamous anti-Russophone and
anti-Russian Iryna Dmytrivna Farion, a deputy in the Rada for Svoboda.
Farion bluntly and without any hesitation tells the media that the coup-installed
Yatsenyuk regime in Kiev should take the opportunity to kill all the
Ukrainians protesting against the new regime in Kiev.
The U.S.-supported
Ukrainian ultra-nationalist politician even says that the Ukrainian
protesters opposed to the U.S.-supported regime in Kiev are "aliens" that need
to be killed as a means of cleansing the country.
She calls for nothing
short of a genocidal operation and even calls her compatriots "creatures"
that need to be eliminated.
Iryna Farion's otherization of Russophones and Russkiyes (ethnic Russians)
is unusual, because as a philologist she should be aware that ethnic
Ukrainians, Russkiyes, and Belarusians (White Russians) are ethno-linguistically
one people which splintered or became distinct from one another due to being
cutoff by the boundaries of different empires that led to regional
distinctions and, over time, the eventual construction of new ethnic and
civic identities.
The terms Velikorus (Great Russian), Malorus (Little
Russian) and Belorus (White Russian) were geographic concepts originally
before they were socially constructed into the loosely-knit ethnic
identities and social structures that are Russkiye, Ukrainian, and
Belarusian.
This does not mean that the Ukrainian identity is inauthentic or that
Ukrainians are a sub-group of Russkiyes, what it means is that Ukrainians
and Russkiyes are the same people with different perceptions of identity.
Their perceived ethnographic differences, which are social constructs, have
been utilized as geopolitical tools by the U.S. and its allies to dupe
nationalist elements inside Ukraine, as well as the Russian Federation, into
fighting and opposing their own kin and to destroy their own societies from
the inside, pursuing a fictitious purification of their societies and people;
these nationalist quests are what enfeeble national unity and cohesion.
Additionally, the Russophone people or Russian-speakers in Ukraine are just
as Ukrainian as the Ukrainaphone people or Ukrainian-speakers.
Their
situation is the same as the members of Irish population who speak English
and not Irish; no one in Ireland questions their Irishness, because they
speak English and not Irish.
In the same context, concerning Russophone
Ukrainians there is no question about the Ukrainianness or its authenticity.
The majority of the Russophones and Ukrainian-speakers are the descendants
of the same local ancestors. The difference between the two groups is merely
that one community adopted Russian as their main language.
Regardless, the
two East Slavic languages are almost identical and the majority of the
Ukrainian population are bilingual in Ukrainian and Russian.
The mythical
tribalism informing the views of Iryna Farion and other nationalists in
Ukraine is nothing more than a distraction from the gross injustices and
unequal distribution of power and wealth in Ukrainian society; it distracts
the population from the real issues about improving their lives and divides
the country's citizens, preventing them from confronting their oligarch
exploiters.
The Perpetrators of Terrorism are Blaming the Victims: Who Are The Real
Terrorists?
Who are the real terrorists?
Unarmed civilians trying to vote or coup
figures like the foolish Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a self-appointed leader of the
"EuroMaidan" movement, that have sent armed groups to threaten and kill them?
Moreover, the actions of the Yatsenyuk regime validate the premise in Moscow
that Russian troops needed to be sent into the Crimean Peninsula to allow
for the voting not to be disrupted. If this did not happen the referendum on
March 16, 2014 may have never taken place, with fighting taking its place in
Crimea.
Unarmed Ukrainian citizens can be clearly heard bravely yelling at the
Yatesenyuk regime's so-called National Guard militias that they are "fascists" in much of the footage that is beginning to emerge from coup-controlled
Ukraine.
These people are the Yatsenyuk regime's terrorists. Unarmed
Ukrainians civilians that that have tried to peacefully prevent the
Ukrainian military and National Guard from entering their towns and cities
are portrayed as outlaws and villains.
The crime of these unarmed civilians
to the have tried to prevent the regime from either illegally establishing
what is essentially martial law in their towns and homes or from using
Ukrainian military and security forces to prevent the anti-coup segment of
the Ukrainian population from voting freely.
These people are the ones that
the U.S. government and the European Union are condemning while trying to
scapegoat Russia for the regime's murder of innocent civilians.
The real terrorists and fascists are the coup leaders in Nulandistan that
have sold themselves and Ukraine to foreign powers.
Also, among the real
terrorist and fascists are the foreign-backers of the Yatsenyuk regime in,
-
the U.S.
-
Britain
-
France
-
Poland
-
Canada
-
Germany,
...which have brought
division, ruin, and destruction across the globe, from,
If Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the former president of
Iran,
is mistranslated and misrepresented by the
mainstream media in North America and Western Europe about saying he wants
to "wipe
Israel off the map" during a conference, the U.S. government and European
Union have field days condemning Iran.
In Nulandistan, however, the coup-installed
head of Khersonshchyna, Governor Yuri Odarchenko, can praise the invasion of
Ukraine by Adolph Hitler and Nazi Germany like
he did on May 9, 2014 to the anger of Ukrainian war veterans, while,
-
the
U.S.
-
Canada
-
the European Union,
...all keep silent.
Do not expect any in-depth
reporting by CNN, the
BBC, France 24, Fox News, or their ilk about the murder of unarmed civilians
in Ukraine by the Yatsenyuk regime either.
These media networks
are conducting an information war against any countries and governments
opposed to the U.S. and its allies.
Instead of reporting what is actually
taking place, the mainstream media in North America and the European Union
will
continue distorting the truth by blaming Russia and those Ukrainians
that it deceivingly, as a means of refusing to acknowledge their legitimate
opposition and resistance to the illegal regime in Kiev, calls "pro-Russian."
