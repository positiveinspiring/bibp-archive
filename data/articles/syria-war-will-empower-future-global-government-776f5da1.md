Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria;
the list goes
on...
From the opening salvo in the war on terror
after 9/11 to the current crisis in Syria, Americas wars - based on flimsy
or non-existent evidence - are increasingly angering the globe.
Global government,
the
long term dream of globalist technocrats responsible for these
provocations, could rise from the ashes of global warfare.
Despite the fact that a war with Syria
is less popular than the United States Congress, the
Obama
administration and the rogue elements supporting it are moving
ahead with a military strike.
The blatant disregard for law and the disconnect
from the people of America further demonstrates the tyrannical nature of the
ruling establishment.
In the aftermath of
the
9/11 attacks, Al-Qaeda was the ever-present boogeyman. They were
the reason our lives have became keenly surveilled, our bodies probed, and
our liberties stifled.
Today, the Obama administration
has allied itself with our former "enemy" in the overthrow of
Libya, Egypt, and now
Syria.
Looking deeper, the age old agenda for world
government will be empowered by these lawless actions.
As
we
reported in 2008,
The United States is going to - and to a
degree already is - be held up as an example of why global mechanisms
and a world structure need to be in place to prevent such actions as
the invasion of Iraq and U.S. support of Georgian forces in the invasion
of South Ossetia.
The shape of the globe could very well be
radically altered by the Syrian crisis.
Thermonuclear war is an unsettling and real
danger. Russia has
warned the United States that there will be catastrophic consequences
in the event of a U.S. led strike on Syria.
Dr. Jerome Corsi told the Alex Jones show today
that a war with Syria represents one of the most dangerous moments in the
history of the globe.
The corruption and wars that have tarnished the
American peoples name will be used to further the aims of
the global elite.
A system of global government is likely to rise. It will gain wide support
in the aftermath of a bloody world war.
But be wary; this government will apparently
stand on moral high ground, but its power will be unprecedented, and so will
its thirst for tyranny.
