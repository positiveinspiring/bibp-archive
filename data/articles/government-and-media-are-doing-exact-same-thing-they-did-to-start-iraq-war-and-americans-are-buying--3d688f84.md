# Government and Media are doing Exact Same Thing they Did to Start Iraq 
War - And Americans are Buying It

They also
lamented their dependence on Iraqi defectors who made
spurious claims to further the goal of regime change.
It was a
grudging admission that the famous newspaper played a
critical role in pushing lies and propaganda, to lead the
U.S. into a 'pre-emptive' war of choice.
Other
corporate media outlets, including those in the
neoconservative (i.e. The Weekly Standard) and liberal
interventionist camps, apparently felt no remorse at
betraying the public.
To be fair,
it wasn't all the fault of 'patriotic' American media.
In Sept.
2002, the Bush-Cheney cabal installed a special Pentagon
intelligence unit to create the web of lies and spin needed
to bring forth the Iraq war drums.
The
Office of Special Plans (OSP),
led by Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith, used
their imagination and hard-line neocon belief in "regime
change" to create Iraqi WMD and ties to terror out of thin
air.
With the "war
on terror" as an excuse and
Dick Cheney as their
cover, OSP bypassed normal intelligence routes and brought
what they wanted straight to President
Bush.
In January
2004, Mother Jones
exposed the workings of this,
"secret
Pentagon intelligence unit and of the Defense
Department's war-planning task force," made up of "a
close-knit team of ideologues who spent a decade or more
hammering out plans for an attack on Iraq and who used
the events of September 11, 2001, to set it into
motion."
An
essential part of this operation was input from the infamous
defector, Ahmed Chalabi, and the Iraqi National
Congress.
Mother
Jones reported:
"According
to multiple sources, Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress
sent a steady stream of misleading and often faked
intelligence reports into U.S. intelligence channels.
That information would
flow sometimes into NESA/OSP directly, sometimes through
Defense Intelligence Agency debriefings of Iraqi
defectors via the Defense Human Intelligence Service,
and sometimes through the INC's own U.S.-funded
Intelligence Collection Program, which was overseen by
the Pentagon.
The INC's intelligence
"isn't reliable at all," according to Vincent
Cannistraro, a former CIA chief of counterterrorism.
"Much of it is
propaganda. Much of it is telling the Defense Department
what they want to hear, using alleged informants and
defectors who say what Chalabi wants them to say,
[creating] cooked information that goes right into
presidential and vice presidential speeches."
Fast-forward
to 2017, and the U.S. is backing other "rebel" groups in
other Middle Eastern countries long targeted for regime
change - and using bogus intel.
The 2013
sarin gas attack that killed at least 281 Syrian civilians
was immediately blamed on Assad, trumpeted by Establishment
media as a "red line" meaning Assad should be forcefully
removed.
But it
turns out the chemicals most likely came from Turkish
intelligence and were fired from rebel-controlled territory.
Soon after
President
Trump made the comment
that regime change in Syria was no longer the goal, the
April 4, 2017 sarin gas attack took place in Khan Sheikhoun,
killing at least 74 Syrian people.
Yet again,
American corporate media parroted the government line. No
skepticism, no questioning.
With the
Tomahawk missile response, Trump had finally come around to
the neocon/liberal interventionist agenda - and the MSM were
positively thrilled.
Pundits
were quick to cement the narrative that 'Assad did it'
before people could think too much, despite quickly mounting
evidence that the official narrative was suspect.
Former CIA
agents were
questioning the rationale,
and then
video proof emerged of
evidence tampering at the chemical attack site.
In fact, an
MIT weapons expert and former DoD science advisor released
his analysis, saying
the evidence for the April sarin gas
attack was tampered with or staged.
Theodore
Postol stated that the White House's supposed proof,
"does
not provide any evidence whatsoever that the US
government has concrete knowledge that the government of
Syria was the source of the chemical attack in Khan
Sheikhoun."
The
parallels are easy to draw between Syrian war propaganda and
Iraq war propaganda, and no less troubling in their
potential to draw the U.S. into launching another "regime
change" invasion.
Countless
lives lost and unimaginable destruction.
Neocons and
liberal interventionists are gnashing their teeth at the
prospect of bringing Syria into the Western fold through
military might.
The
Wolfowitz of today appears to be National Security Adviser
H.R. McMaster - a darling of the neocon cabal and
"golden child" of disgraced General David Petraeus.
It was
recently revealed that McMaster is,
"manipulating intelligence reports given to President
Donald Trump" and "seeking to involve the U.S. in a full
scale war in Syria" with 150,000 American ground troops.
McMaster
may not have the Office of Special Plans (or he may
have something else entirely), but the threat of bogus
intelligence to justify full-scale war is just as real.
If
the mainstream media
have an ounce of credibility, they will begin
questioning the government narrative instead of immediately
reporting it as fact.
We cannot
be led into another war based on government propaganda and
the abandonment of skepticism.
