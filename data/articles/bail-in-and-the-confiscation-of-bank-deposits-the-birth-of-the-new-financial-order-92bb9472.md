The recent bail-in in Cyprus has given the world
a glimpse at the future of the banking landscape.
Now, as Canada gets set to
hardwire the bail-in process into law, analysts like Michel Chossudovsky are
warning how the big banks can use this template to further consolidate their
monopoly of economic control.
This is the GRTV Backgrounder on Global Research
TV:
Those who follow the markets closely know that,
at base, the current financial system is founded not on the bedrock of sound
economic principles but instead upon the quicksand of public perception.
All it takes is one large bump in the road to
upset even the largest of economic bandwagons and usher in a new financial
paradigm.
In the
ongoing meltdown of the European Union,
perhaps the greatest single bump in the road so far just took place in
Cyprus. In the immediate aftermath of the dramatic bank holiday and bail-in
events of last month, many in the financial media began asking whether
Cyprus represents a template for future bail-ins across the European Union
or elsewhere around the globe.
If we are going to seriously ask this question,
however, it is vital that we understand exactly what happened, and what kind
of template this might represent.
The crisis in the Cyprus banking sector has been
building for years, as the small island nations banks began to account for
a greater and greater share of its economy.
The trigger event causing the
recent crisis, however, was - appropriately enough - the result of a
meltdown elsewhere in the Eurozone,
in Greece:
After months of negotiations, the government of
Cyprus
announced it was on the verge of a 10 billion Euro bailout deal with the
so-called troika of the EU, the ECB and the IMF.
But when details of the
plan emerged, including the fact that it had the confiscation of both
insured and uninsured bank deposits baked into the cake,
protests erupted around the country:
The
final deal ended up keeping deposits under 100,000 Euros untouched, but
uninsured deposits were restructured, wiping out the savings and cash flow
of foreign depositors and local businesses alike.
For many, the question is whether this will be a
template for future banking crises in the European Union and elsewhere. When
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup,
intimated this was something that would be considered in future bailouts
in an interview with Reuters and the Financial Times, markets panicked,
causing Dijsselbloem to issue an immediate
retraction of his recorded statements.
The truth, however, is that this idea has
already been discussed for years in the highest circles of the international
banking sector.
In 2010 the Bank for International Settlements issued a
white paper on possible bail-ins of Tier 1 and Tier 2 bank capital in
the event of future banking crises. The proposal was discussed in further
detail by groups like the Financial Stability Board and private sector
entities like KPMG, which issued a July 2012
report on the possibility of future banking bail-ins.
During the midst of the Cyprus scandal, the
government of Canada released its own proposed budget for the coming year,
including
language that suggests a bail-in regime:
The Government proposes to implement a
bail-in regime for systemically important banks.
This regime will be
designed to ensure that, in the unlikely event that a systemically
important bank depletes its capital, the bank can be recapitalized and
returned to viability through the very rapid conversion of certain bank
liabilities into regulatory capital. This will reduce risks for
taxpayers.
The Government will consult stakeholders on how best to
implement a bail-in regime in Canada.
In response to public furore over the proposal,
Canadas Finance Minister was forced to come out last week to
deny that the nebulously defined certain bank liabilities includes
consumer deposits, but refused to clarify precisely what liabilities would
be covered by such language.
As Michel Chossudovsky - professor of economics
at the University of Ottawa - explains, the real danger of the Cyprus
example is not that this will be a common way of dealing with future bank
stresses, but precisely the opposite.
With the bail-in procedure in their
arsenal, bankers and their political cronies will be able to use this weapon
of financial destruction not against the too big to jail of the big six megabanks in America or their counterparts around the world, but against
smaller credit unions and independent banks that threaten their monopoly of
power.
As Professor Chossudovsky goes on to point out
in his article on the subject, The
Confiscation of Bank Savings to Save the Banks, it is no coincidence
that this bail-in regime is being formalized first in Canada.
The
Financial Stability Board (FSB) which has been working on institutionalizing
the bail-in process is an international body coordinating the work of
national and international standard setting bodies for the financial sector.
It sprang from the earlier Financial Stability Forum, itself a creation of
the G7 in 1999, and includes bodies like the
Bank for International
Settlements among its member institutions.
The FSB is currently chaired by Mark Carney, the
current Governor of the Bank of Canada who is set to take the reins of the
Bank of England in July of this year in a highly unusual move.
Before
beginning work for the Canadian Department of Finance, Carney spent 13 years
at Goldman Sachs, where he was involved in a
1998 Russian financial scandal, with Goldman advising the Russian
government at the same time as it was betting against the countrys ability
to repay its debt.
As critics like Matt Taibbi and others have
exhaustively documented, Goldman Sachs has been
at the heart of every major market manipulation in the US since the
Great Depression, and has been the
key cheerleader for the austerity measures that are currently tearing
the Eurozone apart and creating the banking crises in Cyprus and other
European countries.
The path forward on the highway toward the
coming economic collapse is needless to say, perilous.
Worse yet, all of the
off-ramps that are being constructed to lead depositors and investors to
safety during these difficult times are themselves false roads leading to
dead ends themselves constructed by the financial oligarchy.
But as with every such fork in the path, there
is an opportunity for the public to educate themselves about what is really
happening and discover a genuine alternative route on this economic road
map.
The entire existence of the bail-in paradigm makes plain an
uncomfortable truth that the banking establishment has tried to obscure for
generations:
that bank deposits are not piles of money sitting in bank
vaults to be drawn upon as needed, but unsecured loans being made to banksters who use that money to gamble on exotic financial instruments that
themselves are threatening to destroy the world economy.
Once that plain fact has been squarely
confronted, the public has a decision to make:
-
whether to continue to put their faith in
the big banks that has brought this world to the economic abyss
-
or
whether to use their money to build up genuine, thriving local economies
through credit unions, alternative currencies and other financial
alternatives
