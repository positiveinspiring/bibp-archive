# Everything Will Remain The Same Until We End The Wars

War is the root of all major problems threatening over 99%
of humanity in the 21st century.
Others will try to convince you that war is the consequence of many
different things. It is not. It is the consequence of only human
decisions made by people in positions of authority.
These people will try to convince you that war is complicated and that
it has many roots. They will convince others to argue, debate, teach,
and lie on their behalf.
They will say that to end war we need to address other issues first such
as poverty, disease, debt, unemployment, and slavery. They will say that
these things cause war, or that war is waged to prevent these things.
Both are wrong. These are not causes of war. They are consequences of
war.
All major social ills are the result of war because war prevents
humanity from realizing its full potential. We cannot cure diseases
because we kill too many people and we spend too much money (trillions
of American dollars!) in war. War pollutes the environment; it does not
help clean it.
Every person that dies in war, every soldier or civilian, is one less
doctor, teacher, or fire fighter. Every cent spent on war is a cent less
towards cancer or aids research, unemployment insurance, education or
healthcare.
Due to war we cannot provide adequate shelter for our youths. We cannot
feed the poor. We cannot cure the sick or shelter the homeless. We
cannot protect people from natural and human disasters.
As war grows it consumes the poor to feed the rich. War makes the
richest people richer and the poorest people poorer. It strips the
majority naked while veiling war-mongers.
War-mongers use war, war that they create, as a reason for why more war
should be made. This is circular reasoning and therefore wrong. People
can defend themselves better when not attacking each other.
Some people will continue to attack others when others cease to attack
them. There are always casualties before a war is ended, because war
cannot be ended immediately. If war is not ended, however, casualties
will be much higher.
War-mongers will say that the best defense is a good offense. This axiom
is usually wrong. It is only right when you are faced with a stronger
attacking enemy.
When faced with a weaker force or a stronger defensive force, the
reasoning behind it is illogical.
The stronger enemy is always better off defensive. Keep in mind, in our
world, no military is capable of completely destroying an opponent. War
is always long-term.
When a stronger enemy attacks a weaker enemy, it causes the weaker to
become offensive. The attacker would have been better off defensive,
since it cannot immediately destroy the enemy.
The stronger will suffer casualties and will be attacked in revenge
because the weaker cannot make peace, they can only surrender.
The weaker enemy often becomes supported by others that fear the
stronger, creating an even stronger defender. The attacker therefore
becomes more offensive. This is the illogical circular reasoning that
results in a vicious cycle of more offense: armament and escalation.
The only way out of this vicious cycle is for the stronger party to
declare peace, and to prepare their defenses for retaliation from the
weaker while seeking peaceful negotiation.
The weaker will always retaliate if the stronger are offensive, because
the offense of the stronger will leave weak points in their defense that
the weaker will seek to exploit. The weaker, however, are not likely to
attack if their stronger enemy are defensive.
People are much less likely to attack others when not under attack
themselves. When faced with peace and therefore strong defense,
attackers quickly lose motivation. Defense is weakest when attacking
others, because flanks and back are left less protected.
When the weaker is faced with a stronger defensive enemy, they will not
attack and will pursue defense as well. At this point, no party has a
reason to be offensive unless the other one attacks.
Peace is then created. Distrust and anger will persist but will fade in
time.
Current wars will only grow if the stronger, in this case NATO, are
offensive. NATO offense leaves weaker opponents no opportunity for
offering peace, only surrender.
The longer NATO's wars continue, the stronger the opposition to NATO
will grow as more and more people join the weaker party's cause. NATO
has the opportunity to offer peace without surrender. It can do so by
ceasing to act offensively. Without peace on NATO's behalf, there can be
no solution to ongoing humanitarian, economic, and environmental crises.
As long as you are at war you will never find peace. Many of you are
angry because your country is at war, and your are suffering the
consequences of war. Others are angry because your world is at war. You
are part of a global community that wars with itself. The global
community, however, has the power to end wars between nations.
War is a plague on humanity. Without unity we will succumb. The
decisions of powerful individuals have started wars and continue to
wrongly promote offense. These are the same few that profit from ongoing
wars. These people must be stripped of power and held to trial.
These people will not willingly end the war unless they fear those that
oppose war. Most people who are currently protesting for change are
protesting the consequences of war instead of war itself. War is the
root problem. Do not listen to the lies of people who would tell you
otherwise.
If you want to protest, but you don't have a message, your message
should be END THE WARS.
If you are homeless or poor, realize that war is the true reason behind
your plight. If you are sick or injured, realize that war prevents your
governments from being able to cure or heal you. If you are disabled,
realize that war prevents your governments from being to help you.
If you are young, realize that war prevents your governments from being
able to teach you. What good do you hope to learn from war-mongers? They
know only evil. War does not stimulate economies, it ravages them.
Perpetual war creates perpetual debt. To say otherwise is a lie.
If you are a frustrated politician, celebrity, or pundit, realize that
war must end before other issues can be addressed. You must act to end
war before your demands can be resolved effectively.
The weak may only make peace through fighting.
The strong must therefore speak with one
voice:
STOP WAR.
When you strong and at war, peace is the
only demand that truly matters.
