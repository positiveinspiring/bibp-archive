Each day I examine dozens of articles, posts,
essays, videos and the like doing what I do.
Once or twice a year something,
by the sheer grace of God, manages to squeak through and ends up on the
internet where John and Jane Doe can see for themselves that things are not
at all as they seem, either here in the USA, or overseas in Great Britain.
The first gentleman (on the below video) is
Christopher Story.
Let us bear in mind what
Christopher Story wrote in his last
report before
his death on 14 July this year and also
bear in mind the following below statement he gave to the
British Constitution Group on October 2009
while on the subject of outrageous criminality and fraud by the European
Union (EU)...
This extraordinary video you are about to see really needs little explanation
if you have eyes to see and ears to actually hear what is being said.
The second gentleman giving his report to Parliament is Lord
James of Blackheath. This part of the
video was recorded on November 1.
This second gentleman, during the course of making an effort to try to
present what he knew to Parliament, without divulging who and what
foundation X was, or is, practically choked on his words in anxiety and
fear.
You cant make this stuff up folks. And grown men cannot fake being this
afraid and gravely concerned for the future of both the UK and for the
United States.
We are apparently literally months away from some sort of
global financial chain reaction collapse, a worldwide domino effect that
may make September 2008 look like a dismal dress rehearsal.
The Vatican is mentioned at one point, and it is revealed that their gold
bullion holdings exceed all the gold bullion holdings of all the governments
of the world.
Did you know this? I certainly did not.
For those who insist that
the Illuminati
is a myth, an internet urban
legend, or just a whacked out conspiracy theory, I present this video.
Only someone who has a pathological need to
avoid the truth at all costs would refute the eye witness accounts of these
two British Parliamentarians, who obviously knew much more than they felt
comfortable in disclosing.
Lord James of Blackheath describes a Private "Foundation" which has
more money than all the governments of the world put together. This
"Foundation X" willing to bail out the world "for nothing".
What a lovely
sounding old Lord this man is BUT is he seriously this naive?
Nevertheless, why is all this so top secret if it is a real, honest offer by
a Private Group of people who should never have achieved such an amount of
money in the first place (for what I hope are obvious reasons). Further, if
such a Foundation exists (which it certainly seems to) then they can only
have gained this amount of wealth over a very significant period of time
(thinking in decades to centuries here) and it will have been, without a
shadow of a doubt, ill-gotten.
So the question is:
Why don't we simply hold
a gun at their heads fully loaded and say "Hand it over! What's preventing
you?"
Because if they need to talk to a Head of state before they do it then
there must simply be conditions.
And lastly,
-
WHO are these top 6 people of the world?
-
You may say "it said
top 6 security clearance" but so what?
-
How many nations are there?
-
So HOW
can there be only 6 people with a Worldwide top security clearance?
-
From
what nations and what has security got to do with it?
-
Probably very much the
same as what the Official Secrets Act has to do with the Bank of England eh?
This is just weird.
Massive scam or money laundering on the part of
the
Vatican Bank? Who knows...
For those who insist that the "Illuminati" is a myth
