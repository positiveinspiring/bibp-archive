# TPP is Dead, but it's About to Be Replaced by Something Much Worse - TISA

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_tpp59.htm

According to
the
source who
has inside documentation, the TISA,
"if passed
would prohibit regulations on the financial industry,
eliminate laws to safeguard online or digital privacy,
render illegal any 'buy local' rules at any level of
government, effectively dismantle any public advantages to
be derived from state-owned enterprises and eliminate net
neutrality."
Some have said
that keeping financial institutions in check has been the only
thing preventing another global financial crisis.
And while the
citizens' right to privacy is currently somewhat tenuously
protected by privacy laws, hardly anyone can imagine the impact
losing those privacies would entail.
TISA's
specifics are shrouded in secrecy,
with Wikileaks
and Bilaterals being the only
ones to have published any information related to its details.
According to Counter
Punch,
"Earlier draft versions
of TISA's language would prohibit any restrictions on the
size, expansion or entry of financial companies and a ban on
new regulations, including a specific ban on any law that
separates commercial and investment banking, such as the
equivalent of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act.
It would
also ban any restrictions on the transfer of any data
collected, including across borders; place social security
systems at risk of privatization or elimination; and
put an end to Internet privacy
and net neutrality."
Just in case
one might be tempted to think the TISA is just hearsay, rumor,
or the fodder of conspiracy theorists, the facts are that over
50 countries are actively engaged in negotiations to enact TISA.
"The
European Union is negotiating TISA on behalf of its 28
member countries, along with, among others,
-
the
United States
-
Canada
-
Mexico
-
Australia
-
New
Zealand
-
Japan
-
South Korea
-
Taiwan
-
Chile
-
Colombia
-
Peru
-
Norway
-
Switzerland
-
Pakistan
-
Turkey,"
...according
to the documents.
It's possible
some countries are already making moves to allow for the
financial takeover.
Over the last
few months, India has reclaimed most of its currency in
circulation by forcing its holders to surrender their currency
to the
banks or lose their wealth forever.
The new
currency will replace the old but in order to make the exchange,
all cash holding citizens must surrender their bills to the
banks to have its value sustained.
According to
the
Government of Sweden's fact sheet on TISA, the goal of the
agreement is pretty straightforward, largely resembling (for
lack of a better analogy) a global NAFTA.
They write:
The basic
premise is to further develop the General Agreement on Trade
in Services (GATS) and create a better and more predictable
agreement.
The aim is
for the agreement to eventually be integrated into the WTO.
New countries are officially welcome and a number of
countries have joined in since the start. If more countries
joined, the benefits of TiSA would increase.
This would
also be a step towards integrating TiSA into the WTO. One
key issue is the participation of China, which requested in
2013 to be allowed to take part in the negotiations.
China's
entry to TiSA has clear political support from the EU.
TISA's
internet regulations, which have
been dubbed,
"a virtual copy-and-paste out of the TPP's
Electronic Commerce chapter,"
...will most likely be rammed through
by those who stand to gain from it - mega corporations and
government who want to control the flow of digital information.
As the
European Digital Rights (EDRi)
stated in a letter opposing the Orwellian data measures
in TISA:
Fundamental rights must be
respected and not negotiated upon.
Therefore, data flows -
which refer to transfers of individuals' personal data -
must not be part of trade agreements. Trade negotiations
are not suitable for shaping rules affecting fundamental
rights and the rule of law in a democratic society.
