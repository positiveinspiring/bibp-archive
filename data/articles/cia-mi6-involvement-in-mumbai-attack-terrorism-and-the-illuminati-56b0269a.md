When the Americans sought to collapse the Soviet
Union and bring a final end to the Cold War, they did not do it head on, but
chose to bankrupt that nation by luring it into its own version of the
Vietnam War in Afghanistan.
So said
Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was
Barack
Obamas national security advisor throughout his presidential campaign.
Brzezinski has also admitted that the Americans deliberately fostered
Islamic militants as part of that strategy.
This turned out to be the largest CIA operation in US history; Americans
funded and supported the effort of Afghanistans Mujahideen, then ennobled
by Reagan as freedom-fighters, and of course now maligned as terrorists.
The group the Americans chose to operate through was the Hizb i Islami, an
off-shoot of the notorious
Muslim Brotherhood, the umbrella organization
responsible for all factions of Islamic terrorism, including the likes of
Osama bin Laden.
Because of this,
the 9/11 attacks have been dismissed as blowback, but the
truth is that American cooperation with the Muslim Brotherhood goes back to
WWII.
The organization was created prior to that through British assistance.
It derives from what is called the Salafi reform movement of Islam, founded
by a notorious impostor by the name of Jamal ud Din al Afghani. Afghani
agitated against the West on their behalf and assisted in the famous Orabi
revolt.
The British were then provided with their
pretext to invade to stabilize the country, and of course, seize the
all-important Suez Canal.
The Muslim Brotherhood received training and support from the Nazis prior to
WWII, but after the war, control of the organization was passed to the
Americans. However, instead of rounding up former Nazis, the American hired
them for their indispensable expertise. This was part of an international
network known as Odessa, which created ratlines to help former Nazis and
SS officers escape.
Many were brought, under
Operation Paperclip, to
the US to work for NASA. Others fled to South America, and Italy, where they
became part of the notorious
Operation Gladio, who were responsible for the
violence of the Red Brigades during the 70s, and the death of Aldo Moro.
And finally, some left for Egypt, where they
continued to train the Muslim Brotherhood.
However, when the MB failed an assassination attempt against the then-Prime
Minister Gamal Adbun Nasser, he had them rounded up.
During this
persecution, the CIA arranged for many members of the MB to be transmitted
to Saudi Arabia, an important ally, where they became religious
instructors. The Saudis have since tried to blame the rise of militancy in
their country on this influx of Salafis and Muslim Brotherhood, but the
truth is the Saudis are much more closely implicated in these covert
affairs.
After the downfall of the Nixon administration, the CIAs hands were tied.
So, in order to bypass congress, it was agreed that Saudi Arabia would use
its cash windfall from the Oil Crisis to fund CIA covert activities by
proxy.
One of the first projects was the funding of the Contras of Nicaragua, who
were agitating against the duly-elected Sandinistas.
This became part of a
larger international CIA operation called
Iran-Contra, where the Americans
illegally traded arms with the Iranians, and trafficked in Nicaraguan
cocaine, funneled through Mena, Arkansas, under Bill Clintons watch, and
distributed to American ghettos, setting off the crack epidemic. Proceeds of
this illicit traffic were used to finance the Mujahideen of Afghanistan,
of which bin Laden was eventually a key figure.
Likewise, we have to suspect that something deceptive is going on in Mumbai.
Blame is being targeted at the Pakistanis, who have long been accused of
fostering terrorism. Of course they have. CIA support for the terrorists
throughout the Soviet war in Afghanistan was coordinated through the
Pakistani secret service, the ISI.
On December 3,
Outlookindia.com reported that the CIAs station chief in
Delhi approached one of Indias intelligence agencies, the Research and
Analysis Wing, and passed on a fairly specific warning:
In mid-September this year, the CIA station
chief in Delhi sought an urgent meeting with his counterpart in R&AW to
pass on some critical inputs. This was part of an understanding that
Indian and American intelligence had institutionalized in the aftermath
of 9/11.
From its assets in Pakistan and Afghanistan, American
intelligence had come to learn that the Lashkar-e-Toiba was planning to
launch a major terrorist attack in Mumbai, which would be carried out
from the sea.
One police officer who encountered the gunmen as
they entered the Jewish centre that was attacked told the Guardian the
attackers were white, although this could mean they were paler-skinned
Indians from the countrys north.
I went into the building late last night,
he said. I got a shock because they were white. I was expecting them to
look like us. They fired three shots. I fired ten back.
Mumbai locals say the killing spree began at the
Leopold Cafe.
According to
a BBC report, three men walked into the cafe,
drank beer, settled their bills and walked out. Then they fished out guns
from their bags and began firing. Alcohol consumption is strictly forbidden
in Islam.
Gaffar Abdul Amir, an Iraqi tourist from Baghdad, says he saw at least two
men who started the firing outside the Leopold Cafe. He was returning to his
hotel from the seaside with a friend when he saw two men carrying bags and
brandishing AK-47s walking in front of them, shooting.
They did not look Indian, they looked
foreign. One of them, I thought, had blonde hair. The other had a
punkish hairstyle. They were neatly dressed, says Mr Amir.
We will have to keep an eye on the emerging
evidence around who is culpable in the Mumbai attacks.
But any such claims
have to be measured against the backdrop presented above. If they are not,
then we must assume that the distortion is deliberate, and designed to fan
certain sentiments.
Those sentiments would seem to be
pressure
against Pakistan, as part of
the larger recent push by the American
administration to bolster the relationship between themselves,
Israel, and that economic miracle, India.
