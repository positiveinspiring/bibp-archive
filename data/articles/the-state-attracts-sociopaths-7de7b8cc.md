What the
government is good at is collecting taxes, taking
away your freedoms and killing people.
It's not good
at much else.
Tom Clancy
In the science of chaos, "attractors" are operational principles around
which turbulence and apparent chaos are harmonized.
What the limited nature of our prior experiences
dismisses as randomness or disorder, the study of chaos and complexity is
revealing as deeper patterns of regularity. Attractors help to identify the
dynamics by which complex systems organize themselves.
Thus, it could be said that an earthquake fault
line serves as an "attractor" for geologic forces in plate tectonics, just
as river systems are attractors for water engaging in its ongoing relations
with the forces of gravity.
At a social level, an estate sale can be seen as
an attractor for antique dealers; dumpsites as attractors for abandoned
property; or hospitals as attractors for diseases. In marketplace economics,
the pricing system is an attractor for buyers and sellers seeking to
exchange property claims.
The study of chaos is helping us understand why all political systems are
disruptive and destructive of life processes.
Through this new science, we are discovering -
contrary to Plato's hubristic assumptions - that complex systems
produce behavior that is both determined and yet unpredictable. Left to the
playing out of the forces operating within and upon it, a complex system
will spontaneously generate consequences that are implicit - albeit
unpredictable - within it.
But we know that many people do not like a world that is unpredictable and
indifferent to their particular interests.
Thus, a business owner who is unable to
effectively compete for customers in a free market, may seek to disrupt the
order that does not accommodate his whims. He might begin by pursuing
voluntary agreements with his competitors to reduce the pace with which they
pursue their respective interests, a strategy that is rarely successful.
When the voluntary approach doesn't satisfy all
industry members, he and many of his business rivals turn to the state to
compel, by force, results unobtainable in the marketplace.
In Restraint of Trade: The Business Campaign Against
Competition, 1918-1938, documents this politicization of the
business system.
The state is almost universally defined as a system that enjoys a legal
monopoly on the use of violence within a given territory.
Despite all of the media hype, government
schools conditioning, and other institutional propaganda to paint political
systems as noble, morally principled agencies devoted to serving the general
welfare, the state is capable of doing no more than this: compelling people
- through violence and the threat of violence - to do what they do not
choose to do, or to refrain from doing what they do choose to do.
Like the subjugated and exploited proletariat of
Animal Farm,
increasing numbers of men and women read those opening words to the preamble
of the Constitution - "We the People" - and discover the identity of "the
people" who control and benefit from the system that was created.
-
If the state is defined in terms of its
enjoying a monopoly on the use of violence, what is the character of
people who would be attracted to the use of its violent tools and
practices?
-
What sort of people would be attracted
to careers that gave them the arbitrary power to force others to
their will; work premised on the imperative of obedience?
It is almost amusing to see legislators
conducting hearings on the problem of bullying in schools:
I often wonder whether these politicians are
projecting their own "dark side" forces onto others; using playground
ruffians as scapegoats for the more widespread bullying that is the
raison d'etre of politics.
Or might these solons simply be trying to
eliminate competition, in much the same way that local governments war with
the street-gangs that violently dominate urban neighborhoods, a role to be
monopolized by the state's police system?
There is a continuum running between "sociopathic" and "psychopathic"
behavior separating degrees of antisocial conduct. A Post Office mail clerk,
or a receptionist at a DMV office, may not exhibit such traits.
But what about state officials whose functions
are to enforce some governmental edict or program?
The man or woman who is prepared to initiate an
act of punishment to compel obedience to a governmental mandate easily
segues into the SWAT team member or police brute or one who tortures
another. It is the appetite for ultimate power over others that
drives such people.
We have now reached that most vicious end-point
on the continuum, the war system, where the indiscriminate killing of
innocent people - many of them children - becomes justified by the
psychopathic war-lovers on no more compelling ground than that they have the
power to inflict death on a massive scale.
During World War II, allied forces engaged in war crimes every bit as
vicious as those perpetrated by the defeated enemies.
The Nazi psychopaths who ran death camps were
matched by the allied officials who bombed such non-military cities as
Dresden and Hamburg, and vaporized tens of thousands of civilians along with
some U.S. military prisoners of war, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The nuclear bombing of these Japanese cities was
done primarily to impress the Soviet Union, while erstwhile beautiful
cities such as Dresden were leveled because, in the words of one RAF
official,
"we didn't have any other cities left to
bomb."
The RAF Bomber Command chief, Arthur "Bomber"
Harris, said, thirty years later, that he would do the same thing
again if presented with the same choices.
Such is the
mindset of the psychopath!
Sean Hannity and many of his neocon
brethren embrace the same reasoning as Bomber Harris. With increasing
numbers of decent, intelligent Americans able to see the planned war on
Syria as being based on the same kinds of lies and forgeries that led to the
unprovoked war on Iraq,
the war-lovers are trying a different tack.
If people are not prepared to "lob a few
missiles into Syria," Hannity argued, an attack on Iran would be an even
better action to take.
His position - and that of so many other neocons
- comes down to little more than this:
if the boobeoisie is not buying into our
plot against Syria, then let us go attack someone else before any
opposition arises. War is an end in itself, and it matters little who is
chosen as the enemy of the year!
If you have any doubts as to this, watch the
wonderful anti-war film
Wag the Dog.
If, as Randolph Bourne advised,
"war is the health of the state,"
...those who are attracted to the exercise of
violence over others can delude themselves to be health-care practitioners
for a system at war with life itself.
No more than we would expect Mother Theresa to operate a brothel can
we imagine advocates of peace and liberty to be welcomed into the management
of the state.
This is why Ron Paul was so persona non
grata to members of the political elite. He wanted to reduce - perhaps even
eliminate - the violent nature of the American nation-state. He was almost
booed off the stage at a Republican gathering for suggesting that this
country employ the "Golden Rule" as the basis for a foreign policy!
He wanted to minimize that which attracts the
sociopaths and psychopaths to the state: the opportunity to use
ever-increasing levels of destructive violence against their fellow humans.
