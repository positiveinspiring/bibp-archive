Gold and silver prices are being manipulated by a dynastic group of men who
loathe you and want all your money, even if it drives you to bankruptcy. Or
suicide...
Theyve been doing this for more than 200 years,
printing fiat money out of thin air and selling precious metals,[1] [2]
only to cry shortage and then offer you deflationary cash for your
gold or silver purchase. Theyre the best at this con game and theyve got
it down just right.
But now the bullies are on the run, having been outed by Mr. Andrew
Maguire, a metals trader in London who testified about JPMorganChases
shady trading practices.[3]
Mr. Bill Murphy, Chairman of the Gold Antitrust Action Committee
(GATA),
published the following dispatch in support of Maguire:
In November 2009 Maguire contacted the CFTC
enforcement division to report this criminal activity. He described in
detail the way JPMorgan Chase signals to the market its intention to
take down the precious metals. Traders recognize these signals and make
money shorting the metals alongside JPM. Maguire explained how there are
routine market manipulations at the time of option expiry, non-farm
payroll data releases, and COMEX contract rollover, as well as ad-hoc
events.
On February 3 Maguire gave two days' warning by e-mail to Eliud
Ramirez, a senior investigator for the CFTC's Enforcement Division, that
the precious metals would be attacked upon the release of the non-farm
payroll data on February 5. On February 5, as market events played out
exactly as predicted, further e-mails were sent to Ramirez while the
manipulation was in progress.
It would not be possible to predict such a market move unless the
market was manipulated.
In an e-mail on February 5 Maguire wrote: It is common knowledge here
in London among the metals traders that it is JPM's [JP MorganChase]
intent to flush out and cover as many shorts as possible prior to any
discussion in March about position limits. I feel sorry for all those
not in this loop. A serious amount of money was made and lost today and
in my opinion as a result of the CFTC's allowing by your own definition
an illegal concentrated and manipulative position to continue. [4]
Now what?
True, the New York Post chose to run
the story about Maguires revelations, but how far will that story get? What
other confessions are on the way?
The Gold Cartel is running out of available
central bank gold to meet the burgeoning demand, said Mr. Murphy in a
separate interview.[5]
Where does this leave the rest of us? When we
want our physical gold from the bank or whatever entity houses it, what do
we do when they offer us worthless dollars or Euros?
Heres a sitrep. Its not pretty so you may want to stop reading right about
here.
The Great American
Nightmare
The American Dream is dead and America is flat broke.
Thats not to say you cant still go out for a
cold one after work each night, or rent a DVD and veg for hours in your
overstuffed lounger in front of that 42-inch Samsung. Or get that wonderful
foot massage and pedicure on Saturday morning.
Even deep in the economic
blood-red of the United States of America, theres always room for a six
pack, a movie and a foot rub.
Way things are now, you cant possibly pay down all your bills in your
lifetime, even though you probably worked out a plan to do so within ten
years, but that was 12 years ago when things werent so bad and you had a
fulltime job with bennies and a small savings account, the IRA and the 401K
and all that stuff you probably never thought youd ever need.
Too high and climbing, your mortgage is overwhelming. The insurance on your
home keeps creeping up year after year for no apparent reason, or at least
any sane reason the bank can give you, and you cant very well cancel it
because the bank that holds your mortgage wont let you and they keep
threatening you with immediate foreclosure if you as much as think about it.
With this new so-called healthcare reform now in place, your medical bills
are skyrocketing, especially since your spouse went into the hospital with
intestinal problems, and neither of you can afford health insurance because
that would cost you both more than $2,000 a month in premiums, and neither
of you takes home more than $1,500 after taxes every 30 days.
You have enough debt to saddle a medieval horse, and that horses back is
swaying more and more with time. Any day now, itll surrender to gravity
like a droopy chin, and the once majestic beast will drown in a sea of debt
that screams over you like a tsunami that traveled 10,000 miles from the
dark, cold Antarctic, gathering more and more momentum with each passing
mile.
Is there any recovery from such a force of nature?
The good news is that once you come out from under that bankruptcy, all
those material things you accumulated over your lifetime - the beautiful
home and the car and truck, and your worldly possessions - will be in
someone elses hands, starting with your bank, which has no use for your
stuff anyway except for what it might fetch at auction.
No more dusting off the little Hummel pieces from grandma. No more cleaning
the fine silver you got on your wedding day from all your friends who
chipped in money they didnt have. No more vacuuming and cleaning your
lovely home you built from scratch and promised to pay down before the end
of that 30-year, 6% loan.
Youll be left with little more than a few articles of clothing, if even
those. Life is no longer what you thought it would be.
The American Dream has fast become The American
Nightmare, brought on by an invisible force some call dark matter, the stuff
of science fiction that tells us we cant see it or smell it or touch it,
but its effects are there and theyre real so you best believe it.
And in the wake of all this, youre left scratching your head, wondering
what the hell just happened here? Does anyone have an accurate answer? Does
anyone outside your life even care?
Your friends have all but abandoned you, because
theyre in the same position, facing bankruptcy or having just been spat out
by the court system that took everything they once owned. Daily phone calls
that once beamed happiness and baseball and Oprah now scream and cry tales
of IRS liens, foreclosures and that fourth job, the one that starts at two
in the morning when the babys crying.
Your family cant help you, either, because they just got hit with a huge
tax bill that theyll never be able to pay, but hey, wait, theres always
that monthly payment system with the IRS, and they only charge 30% interest
on top of what they say you already owe them.
So, no, even family cant help you. Seems everyone you know is being pulled
under by this rip tide of dark matter whose invisible and unyielding gravity
takes no prisoners, but its all too happy to take you down down down into
that forever abyss.
The American Nightmare used to be the stuff of Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen
King. Now its front-page headlines even in mainstream media. No one can
escape it.
The United States is going down that same road
of hyperinflation and depression that effectively sacked the Weimar Republic
in Germany, in 1923.[6] [7] [8]
It's Déjà Vu All Over
Again
On the final day of hyperinflation, 16 November 1923, one US dollar netted
4.2 trillion marks.
During better times, the exchange had been four
marks to the dollar. Inflation had skyrocketed to a dizzying 300 million
percent. People were carrying sacks of devalued cash in their bags, baby
strollers, grocery sacks, and stuffed into their clothes.[9] [10]
The very same patterns from that depressing era are now upon us again, only
dressed in different, perhaps more stylish, clothes this round. An
engineering feat, the destruction of a once-strong and proud Germany in the
early 20th century has visited the world dozens of times since the late
1770s, shortly after Meyer Amschel Bauer founded his little banking
institution in Frankfurt, Germany.
Bauers father, Amschel Moses Bauer, hung
a red shield outside his five-story house, signifying he was the go-to man
for money changing and lending in town, a skill he passed on to Meyer
Amschel.
In short order, Bauer the youngers business
flourished, and he wished to be more closely associated with it, so he
changed his name to Rothschild. In German, rot is red; schild
is shield. The Red Shield.[11] [12]
Over a 40-year period, Meyer Amschel Rothschild forged the most powerful
banking system in the world, taking over the Bank of England, plus the major
banks in France, Germany, Italy and Austria, and soon expanded outward like
a slowly diffusing cloud of poison gas.
Rothschilds five sons further scattered their
fathers demon seeds and established very potent banking cartels of their
own.
In very little time,
the Rothschilds established their own
agents within many different European governments, and then set sights
across the Atlantic on the United States, still wet behind the ears and
eager for the affectations of all suitors outside her virginal shores.[13]
[14]
Perhaps the best depiction of international bankers and their plots against
us was made by historian Dr. Carroll Quigley:
Hundreds of years ago, bankers began to
specialize, with the richer and more influential ones associated
increasingly with foreign trade and foreign-exchange transactions.
Since these were richer and more
cosmopolitan and increasingly concerned with questions of political
significance, such as stability and debasement of currency, war and
peace, dynastic marriages, and worldwide trading monopolies, they became
the financiers and financial advisors of governments.
Moreover, since their relationships with
governments were always in monetary terms and not real terms, and they
were always obsessed with the stability of monetary exchanges between
one countrys money and another, they used their power and influence to
so two things:
(1) to get all money and debts expressed
in terms of a strictly limited commodity - ultimately gold
(2) to get all monetary matters out of
the control of governments and political authority, on the ground
that they would be handled better by private banking interests in
terms of such a stable value as gold. [15]
The goals of these international bankers and the
higher power they serve have since been accomplished.
We need only to step back in time, to 1913, when
the US Federal Reserve Act was passed, effectively handing over control of
the USs money supply, and its maintenance and distribution to The First
Sphere of Influence.
To this very day, that same poison, manufactured and delivered by the House
of Rothschild and those they serve, now called The First Sphere of
Influence, infect America to the point of cancer and near-death.
The Rothschilds are acting as financial and
political agents for an even larger and more sinister force, but thats not
the focus of this particular story.
We have seen our freedom and liberty stripped away like so much good, sturdy
paint under a demon sandblaster. The government and its minions have been
distancing themselves from the population, feeding more and more
disinformation and propaganda to the masses, and silencing anyone speaking
out against their ill deeds.
After all, The First Sphere of Influence
controls all mass media, and have since 1915.[16]
Two of the most courageous people even to attempt to write on this subject
are the husband-wife team of Sterling and Peggy Seagrave.
In their
brilliant and well-researched book, Gold Warriors: Americas Secret
Recovery of Yamashitas Gold, they said the following about those in
power:
We live in dangerous times, like Germany in
the 1930s, when anyone who makes inconvenient disclosures about hidden
assets can be branded a terrorist or a traitor.
A few months ago [sometime in 2002 or 2003],
three ex-ambassadors to Japan declared that former American POWs and
civilian slave laborers, suing Japanese corporations for compensation,
were tantamount to terrorists. Now a CIA official says that leaks of
classified information must be stopped, even it is necessary to send
SWAT teams into journalists homes.
Everybodys national security is a serious matter. We have no argument
with that. But national security can be invoked to hide official
corruption, and conflict of interest. Its called tyranny.
The only cure is openness and sunlight.
Squeezed In a Vise With No
Way Out
The tenth year of our new millennium has brought in new legislation on many
levels.
With the passage of the healthcare bill, which
also mandates a new and higher taxation on those hard-working American
citizens earning more than $200,000 a year, were now seeing ever-increasing
and sweeping reforms of our Constitutional laws and forms of protection.
Interestingly, too, all these reforms have risen before, in one form or
another, in all countries hijacked by The First Sphere of Influence. What is
very disturbing is that this enormous increase in personal income taxes is
being justified falsely. The Obama administration claims that those very
taxes from Americans, especially those earning more than $200,000 a year,
will help fund Americas healthcare reform.
This is an outright lie.
Americas personal income taxes are paid to the privately owned Internal
Revenue Service, a registered corporation of Puerto Rico, which promptly
sends those funds to the Bank of England in the City of London, where they
are dispersed among certain European central banks and the
Bank for International Settlements in
Basel, Switzerland.
All owned and controlled by The First Sphere of
Influence, acting on behalf of an even larger and darker force.
The real design behind increasing taxes of the highest-earning Americans is
to drain the strongest and most successful Americans of their wealth at a
more accelerated pace than in the past.
Why now? The Internet allows more and more
concerned citizens to learn about the dark machinations of The First Sphere
of Influence, and poses a direct threat to their actions. Over the past ten
years alone, witness the passage of the Patriot Act, establishment of the
Department of Homeland Security, passage of the healthcare reform bill, etc.
All these measures have effectively dissolved significant portions of the US
Bill of Rights and our beloved Constitution.
The powers that be repeat their tried-and-true pattern of:
-
Demoralizing a public with depressing
news in the mainstream media, plunging the nation into serious debt
using controlled and manipulated recessions and depressions,
low-income jobs and high unemployment, evermore controlling new laws
and regulations that are increasingly intrusive to all citizens.
-
Destabilizing a population by pitting
groups against each other, i.e. democrats vs. republicans or
prochoice vs. anti-abortion or gun owners vs. anti-gun citizens, in
pitched battle.
-
Creating crises after crises, e.g.
internecine wars, regional wars, global wars, the so-called War on
Terror, 9/11 attacks, illegal attacks on nations like Afghanistan
and Iraq.
-
Forcing legislation that removes basic
Constitutional rights. Example: United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change effectively destroys the entire US Constitution.
-
Normalizing a population, allowing those
in power to bring the American public under its sphere of influence,
bringing to a screeching halt all protests against the regime,
eliminating all challengers, and thus fully squeezing the American
public within an otherworldly vise.
The Power of Gold
Historically when Americans have felt an economic constriction, where the
dollar begins to lose so much value that even the Peoples Republic of China
threatens to dump it like old bathwater, they turn to the only precious
resource on earth that has held at least some value, even in direst times:
gold.
No one knows when gold was first discovered, but it started showing up about
5,000 years BC in various parts of the world: central Europe during the
Copper age, and in Egypt and Saudi Arabia during the Bronze age, about 2,500
BC.
While gold may have had other uses when first
discovered, it clearly was molded and shaped into many different artifacts,
which have been found over the millennia. Ancient Egyptians worshipped gold,
calling it a gift from the sun. Its sheer beauty and glamour, not to mention
malleability, have enabled artists to fashion thousands of different styles
of jewelry and other precious artifacts.
To say that humans have been mesmerized by gold
for nearly 7,000 years would clearly be an understatement. Since its
discovery, it has been the King of Trade the world over.[17] [18] [19]
The human mind reacts to gold in a most reverent fashion, quite unlike it
does to any other substance.
A Latin proverb faithfully expresses our
potential for venality:
Even the just may sin with an open chest of
gold before them.
The First Great Gold Rush
The first gold rush in the US started on 24 January 1848, when James W.
Marshall discovered gold on land owned by trader Captain John Sutter,
who kept a diary of the events over the next decade. What he saw was an
exercise in human greed.
Something else altogether emerged from the fracas: a display of American
freedom and liberty.
Each person who braved dangerous geography,
weather and wild wild natives had come to the West because they knew that
whatever they discovered, whatever they pulled from Mother Earth with their
own hands and endless labor was theirs. And theirs to keep.
King Muckety-Muck would not be standing over them to collect his usurious
96% of their hard-earned pay. The Bank of England would not send out its
collectors to threaten them with their signature penalty for nonpayment:
drawing and quartering.
What Captain Sutton witnessed ruined him for life, and he never recovered.
Buried deep among his pain and suffering, the good Sutton knew he was also
eyewitness to the very pillars that helped build our great country:
independence, and the absolute freedom to choose what to do with it.
Captain Suttons entry for 28 January 1848 is telling, describing a secret
meeting with Mr. James W. Marshall, who discovered several ounces of
gold on Captain Sutters property:
Marshall arrived in the evening, it was
raining very heavy, but he told me he came on important business. After
we were alone in a private room he showed me the first specimens of
gold, that is he was not certain if it was gold or not, but he thought
it might be; immediately I made the proof and found that it was gold.
I told him even that most of all is 23 carat
gold. He wished that I should come up with him immediately, but I told
him that I have to give first my orders to the people in all my
factories and shops. [20]
Mr. Marshall told his story in Hutchings
California Magazine, in November of 1857:[21]
I am not quite certain to a day, but it was
between the 18th and 20th of that month, 1848, I went down as usual, and
after shutting off the water from the race I stepped into it, near the
lower end, and there, upon the rock, about six inches beneath the
surface of the water, I was entirely alone at the time.
I picked up one or two pieces and examined
them attentively; and having some general knowledge of minerals, I could
not call to mind more than two which in any way resembled this:
sulphuret of iron, very bright and brittle; and gold, bright, yet
malleable; I then tried it between rocks, and found that it could be
beaten into a different shape but not broken.
I then collected four or five pieces and
went up to Mr. Scott (who was working at the carpenters bench making
the mill wheel) with the pieces in my hand, and said, I have found it.
What is it? inquired Scott.
Gold, I answered.
Oh, no, returned Scott. that cant be.
I replied positively, I know it to be nothing else.
Over the next year, Captain Sutters land was
overrun by squatters and other miners who collectively mined more than $40
million in gold. That figure rose to $55 million only one year later. The
first gold rush was on.
Soon after, General Sutter lamented over his predicament, in Hutchings
California Magazine, November 1857:
Soon as the secret was out my laborers
began to leave me, in small parties first, but then all left, from the
clerk to the cook, and I was in great distress; only a few mechanics
remained to finish some very necessary work...
Then the people commenced rushing up from San Francisco and other parts
of California, in May, 1848: in the former village only five men were
left to take care of the women and children...
What a great misfortune was this sudden gold discovery for me! It has
just broken up and ruined my hard, restless, and industrious labors,
connected with many dangers of life, as I had many narrow escapes before
I became properly established. From my mill buildings I reaped no
benefit whatever, the mill stones even have been stolen and sold...
By this sudden discovery of the gold, all my great plans were
destroyed. [22]
When gold diggers flooded California, they
plundered and, like marauding army ants, were equal-opportunity rapists,
thieves, muggers and killers: young or old, rich or poor, Americans or
Indians.
Chief Young Joseph of
the Nez Perces
shared his thoughts:
For a short time we lived quietly. But this
could not last. White men had found gold in the mountains around the
land of winding water. They stole a great many horses from us, and we
could not get them back because we were Indians.
The white men told lies for each other. They
drove off a great many of our cattle. Some white men branded our young
cattle so they could claim them. We had no friend who would plead our
cause before the law councils.
It seemed to me that some of the white men
in Wallowa were doing these things on purpose to get up a war.
[23]
He Who Controls the
Gold Makes the Rules
Since its discovery, every world power has attempted to mine gold all the
way out the farthest reaches of their borders and then some.
And when they learned about or found it in the
territories of their neighbors, they went to war or simply looted the castle
without a fight. Recall the plundering of aboriginal American gold by the
Spanish from the late 1500s, resulting in the untimely demise of the Aztecs,
Mayas and Incas.
Several millennia after its discovery, gold and silver were recognized as
the most valuable monetary units across the globe, with several countries
eventually establishing their own gold standard, which set limits on the
value of their own currency and the amount of credit that could be issued.
As with all good policies, somewhere along the
way, those policies became corrupted by the avarice of a few who sought to
consolidate the worlds gold supply and control and manipulate whatever else
lay beyond their reach.
Sterling and Peggy Seagrave have studied all aspects of gold for many
years.
They summarize their belief about who controls
the worlds gold:
I dont like using the word cartel for gold
or diamonds, but there is a relatively small group of people who control
MOST of the smelted gold we call LGS for London Gold Standard, because
all the members of the network of banks and billionaires/trillionaires
like to know the quality/purity/track-record of the gold they handle.
This network obviously includes the,
...and all the other super-rich who also own chains of banks and
control world affairs through a pyramid of gofers including leaders of
government, armed forces, and secret services in the public and private
sectors, all benefitting from influence peddling.
Within this network there are certain clusters where they intersect
with the Vatican, Masons, the Sicilian Mafia, and countless other
underworld groups that also deal in hard drugs - most of the laundered
money from which ends up in US banks, with UK banks, Swiss banks, and
offshore banks, including the CIA black banks first set up by Paul
Helliwell for Wild Bill Donovan and Meyer Lansky in OSS and early CIA
days.
Not everyone who has masses of LGS gold belongs to these networks (like
the Chinese who work independently, and the Indian gold jewelry trade,
which has its own channels). There is still a great deal of Marcos
gold resmelted from what he recovered of Yamashitas Gold, and reburied
in several remote stashes guarded by a group known as the Elders.
And several very rich Filipino families keep their hoards of ingots and
biscuit bars in large vaults beneath big buildings in Manila, Cebu, and
other cities. [24]
Without question, the control of gold lies in
the hands of a very select few, which makes most ordinary people shy away
from any thoughts of gold, let alone any ideas of ownership.
So why should a short history of gold concern
the average American?
Details aside, what should concern you most is how gold has been vaulted
from a beautiful aesthetic object to a symbol of absolute power and control.
Gold isnt something you can eat or drink. Its only worth something because
we place high value in it. We wish to possess gold and call it ours, show it
off to friends and acquaintances, and visitors from afar. In times of
economic strife, gold bought shelter, food and safety to those who had it.
For others, it lead to an early death at the
hand of someone else who coveted the booty and had the means to snatch it.
Truth? Gold only has value if people feel it has value and those people back
up their feelings with money to pay handsomely for it. People the world over
feel that gold is the best means of protecting ones personal wealth.
But what if you were stranded on a deserted
island with no food and you were offered the choice between ten pounds of
gold or ten pounds of McDonalds double quarter-pounders with that rich,
golden cheese? Now tell me, which would be worth more at that moment in your
life?
Wise guy that I am, Id take both, but Im sure
you appreciate the example.
In the US, the Coinage Act of 1873 firmly established the gold standard over
silver, the value of which immediately fell sharply. For the next 60 years,
gold should have become the buffer that protected the US dollar and, in a
perfect world, it would have guaranteed its value.
Unfortunately, the sponsorship and passage of the illegal Federal Reserve
Act of 1913 by European banking interests and their US Agents, all inimical
to the United States, virtually guaranteed that the dollar would not be
protected by gold.
Making matters even worse, the institution of
the US personal income tax paved a long and wide road down which The First
Sphere of Influence drove its chariots of war right up to the doorstep of
America, and began a century of rape, pillage, plunder and dominance over
our once-sovereign nation.
We the People Begin to
Wake Up
At the end of the 19th century, people were beginning to hear what was going
on behind the scenes, and were taking an interest.
It took brave souls to step out in public and
onto a soapbox, and deliver a moving speech that educated and captivated an
audience. Mrs. Mary Lease was a brilliant orator and ardent
campaigner for William Jennings Bryan, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for
President several times.
In her 12 August 1896 speech at Cooper Union
Hall, she said:[25]
An organized effort is making to deceive
the people. There are two great enemies of thought and progress, the
aristocracy of royalty and the aristocracy of gold. Long ago, the
aristocracy of royalty came to a common plane with the common people by
the discovery of gunpowder, and the two met on a common field. Where is
the respect of old for royalty?
Even the English speak of their sovereign,
Queen Victoria, as being made not of common clay, but of common mud. The
aristocracy of royalty is dying out.
But here in this country we find in place of an aristocracy of royalty
an aristocracy of wealth. Far more dangerous to the race is it than the
aristocracy of royalty. It is the aristocracy of gold that disintegrates
society, destroys individuals and has ruined the proudest nations.
It has called Rothschild's agent here to
make the platform of the Republican party.
Money Out of Thin Air
Only a few short decades later, The First Sphere of Influences agent in the
White House, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, abolished the gold standard,
thus permitting them to float the US dollar on a cushion of thin foul air,
on 19 April 1933.[26]
Printing money of no value became the norm,
allowing The First Sphere of Influence-controlled Fed to make substantial
loans to Americans and their hard-won businesses, without the responsibility
of backing the Feds money with real security.
The Fed earned large sums from interest paid on
those loans, too.
In essence, a dollar was certainly not worth a dollar, but much less and, if
one wished to convert that dollar to something of true value, i.e. gold,
Americans were now at a total loss. The previous gold standard allowed
anyone holding a bank note to exchange that note for real 99.9% gold or, in
the case of the silver standard, real 99.9% silver.
Our government and its people believed in the
value of gold (and silver), and thus used gold as a foundation of the worth
of our currency.
Without the gold standard, The First Sphere
of Influence then began calling in all gold.
They had Roosevelt make it illegal to own gold
under Executive Orders 6102 and 6260. Those who complied reluctantly
surrendered their gold for worthless dollars. No one really knows how much
gold was confiscated during that time, from April 5, 1933 to 1974, when
President Gerald Ford revoked 6260.
The First Sphere of Influence cleverly devalued the US dollar in 1933, while
immediately raising the price of gold from about $20 per ounce to $35
dollars an ounce. Those who turned in their coveted wealth lost the golden
opportunity to earn a 75% return on their gold investment.
And those who either kept their gold or bought
it at $20 an ounce had nearly doubled their money overnight.
Is It Gold, Or Is
It... Tungsten?
Where did all that confiscated gold go?
It was supposed to be melted down, purified, and
then used to forge new gold bullion, which would be stored at the United
States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, whose gold-storage
facility was constructed in 1937.
If you believe the statements on the US
Mint website, the facility now houses 147.3 million ounces of gold, although
its purity is never revealed.
Over the past 16 years, there have been many reports that gold originating
from stores at Ft. Knox is not even close to 99.9% gold. Not by far. With a
substantial tungsten blank at its core, surrounded by a 1/16-inch layer of
pure gold, these gold bars have been distributed far and wide over the
world.
Writer Dan Edens recent expose on Ft. Knoxs fake gold revealed:
This bar would feel right in the hand, it
would have a dead ring when knocked as gold should, it would test right
chemically, it would weigh *exactly* the right amount, and though I
don't know this for sure, I think it would also pass an x-ray
fluorescence scan, the 1/16" layer of pure gold being enough to stop the
x-rays from reaching any tungsten. You'd pretty much have to drill it to
find out it's fake. [27]
Allegedly, the Chinese government received
nearly 6,000 tungsten-core gold bars in 2009, only to discover upon close
inspection that they were all counterfeit.
Serial numbers traced the metal bars back to
Ft.
Knox. The results of Chinas investigation suggest that there may be as many
as 1.5 million 400-ounce tungsten-core gold bars on the worldwide market
today, a value of more than $600B.[28]
Billion...
Dollars...
Even though its long after the fact, it is intriguing to note that, in
2004, NM Rothschilds & Sons, Ltd., the London-based corporation of the
Rothschilds investment bank, quietly withdrew from the gold market.[29]
What did the Rothschilds know that we did not?
Curiously, within four years of withdrawing from the gold market, the value
of gold held by the Rothschilds more than doubled.[30]
Previously, the price of gold had been set in exclusive meetings at the
offices of NM Rothschilds & Sons, Ltd. in London, at least until they
withdrew from the gold market and their seat was taken by Barclays.[31]
Twice a day, a small group of five men,
connected to each other in a cold virtual reality via conference call,
calmly fix the price of gold, a ripple that soon propagates across the world
in all gold markets and sets the tone for all gold trading.
Many have asked:
London has long been the financial seat of gold trading, and over the
centuries has set all gold standards that the world follows.
It would be
next to impossible to unseat London as the standards-setting capital for
gold in the world. And to think that those in power in the gold market there
would even consider allowing outsiders into the mix would be tantamount to
heresy.

Another Insider Blows
the Whistle
Are there any historical precedents that signal what economic calamity may
be coming?
If you correlate the price of gold with the
state of the economy in the US over the past 65 years, you see that when
gold rises steeply, the dollar is somehow devalued, leading to extreme
economic instability. In short, a prolonged recession or even a depression
from which it takes decades to recover. All of this is well orchestrated, of
course, by The First Sphere of Influence.
Over the past ten years, in particular, there have been many indicators of
manipulation of economic markets, especially gold. So much so that formal
groups and companies have formed to study the situation, to provide
countermeasures.
The Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee (GATA),
chaired by Mr. Bill Murphy, was founded by Mr. Murphy and Mr. Chris
Powell.
Mr. Murphy explained:
Wed heard that Long-Term Capital
Management was short 400 tons of gold. We figured when they blew up,
they would have to cover their position. JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Chase
Manhattan all were selling when gold got around $300. Then I heard some
other things and I said, this is being managed here. One thing led to
anther and we started GATA in January of 1999. I was on CNBC the next
two weeks and that was the last time Id been heard in America. Ive
been blackballed ever since. Not even our name [GATA] mentioned.
Why did they [the Rothschilds] get out of the gold-fixing business?
They knew this was going to blow up and theyre very very smart people.
I think they knew it was sort of a Ponzi scheme, and the gold market was
going to blow up and they didnt want to be around it.
We at GATA have put together 11 years of evidence and so we know whats
happening. Things are beginning to blow up. We are now suing the Fed
because weve uncovered some talk about gold swaps and we used the
Freedom of Information Act to have them tell us what was going on. They
refused to tell us anything, saying these are secrets so they didnt
have to tell.
Three months ago, European central banks stopped selling gold to the
general public.
The Gold Cartel is running out of available central bank gold to meet
the burgeoning demand.
We presented testimony at the Commodity Futures Trade Commission, the
CFTC, hearings on March 25 [2010] and dropped a bomb on them: a former
JP Morgan trader told everyone how JP Morgan was making money flushing
out speculators. They were making money when everyone else was obviously
losing money, so they were laughing at the rest of the world.
The whistleblower, Andrew Maguire and his wife, were hit by a car the
next day outside of London. The guy hit two more cars, and there was a
helicopter chase before they caught the guy. Not one word about the guy
who hit them has been made. Not one word since. It was another
coincidence arising from this hearing: first, the live webcast feed of
my testimony went dark during the entire testimony, then Andrew gets hit
by a car. Again, just a coincidence?
One week ago, this story went viral on the Internet in China, Russia,
across the world, but not here in the United States until the Posts
story. [32]
After nearly 12 years of media silence on GATA,
the New York Post, on Sunday, 11 April 2010, published a story by Michael
Gray,
Metal$ are in The Pits - Trader Blows Whistle on Gold
& Silver Price Manipulation, describing for the first time in
more than a decade the price manipulation of gold and silver on the open
market.
JPMorgan acts as an agent for the Federal
Reserve; they act to halt the rise of gold and silver against the US
dollar. JPMorgan is insulated from potential losses [on their short
positions] by the Fed and/or the US taxpayer.
HSBC conducts an ongoing
manipulative concentrated naked short position in gold. Silver is much
easier to manipulate due to its much smaller [market] size, Maguire
said.[33]
At the same CFTC hearing, one man said that
there is 50 times more gold traded than is available physically, but then
Mr. Jeff Christian of the commodities firm CPM Group corrected this
statistic on the record.
He said that the London Bullion Market
Association (LBMA)
leverages gold 100 to one, meaning that if, at any one time, 100 people
demand their physical gold bullion be given to them, only one customers
request could be granted.
The other 99 customers would have to settle for
cash, its price determined by the exchange.
That is tantamount to a default on the
trade, says Murphy.
In that same Post article, Andrew Maguire stated
boldly:
If you sell something you do not own, then
that is fraud.
What Can An Ordinary
Person Do?
While its been six years since the Rothschilds pulled out of gold-fixing,
the gold market appears, to all intents and purposes, solid and functional
to the naïve outside observer.
How much longer can this façade last? In past
markets when the price of gold rose more than 50% in a short time, the
overall economy nosedived into a recession or, even worse, a depression. Are
we seeing the beginnings of that depression? The short answer is yes.
All the parts are in place: high gold prices,
high inflation that appears to be approaching hyperinflation, poor housing
market, high unemployment, severe increase in personal income taxes, general
public lethargy and severe ignorance about these important affairs.
The very people who designed and built this system of gold trading, wrote
all the legislation that governs it, made all the rules for trading, are in
a unique position: they can manipulate it at will, anytime, anywhere, and
without permission from anyone. And theyre doing it right now under our
noses.
Even if you dont care about gold or the gold market, this dire situation
should matter to you. It should matter because if gold continues to rise,
and all the other criteria described above continue in place, then you and
your family will be in the middle of the worst depression in the history of
the world.
Even if you do not have the funds to buy pounds
and pounds of gold bullion, you can buy gold in small quantities.
And if you cant afford gold, buy silver.
Historically, both gold and silver have rebounded after crashes, only to
rise up up up again in the next cycle of price fixing and manipulation by
The First Sphere of Influence.
GATAs Bill Murphy said,
Understanding that the manipulation of the
price of gold is profoundly important to all markets and the American
public. On January 31, 2008, GATA placed a $264,000 full-page color
advertisement in The Wall Street Journal.
GATAs ad warned,
This manipulation has been a primary
cause of the catastrophic excesses in the markets that now threaten
the whole world.
What GATA warned against has come to pass.
[34]
What can an ordinary person do?
As with all other coming disasters, educate
yourself first about the dangers, both overt and hidden. With a little
knowledge, you may save yourself and your family.
Sadly, it wont do much good to talk with your
so-called elected officials like Congressmen and Senators, because theyre
part of the grand scheme that is destroying America today, part of the great
inside job that is clandestinely eating away at the very fabric of our
existence and the foundation of our country.
When we have a sitting president signing
international agreements that strip us of our Constitutional rights,
increasing taxes on the wealthy, and pursuing a communist-style policy on
behalf of The First Sphere of Influence, then we know were in deep trouble
and must act decisively, and do so en masse.
If this trend continues, we could see gold
at $3000 to $5000 an ounce. And with hyperinflation, much higher than
that, said Murphy.
Gold is a barometer (thermometer) of US financial market health. The
Gold Cartel defused this barometer by suppressing the price of gold,
which aided the Fed in keeping interest rates too low, for too long.
This led directly to the financial market and economic debacles of the
day.
After all, what does the press talk about when the price of gold soars:
too much inflation, a US dollar problem, or a crisis of some other sort.
All of it is bad for an incumbent administration and Wall Street. Both
hate a rising gold price. It is widely mentioned that if gold had kept
pace with inflation in the US, it would be $2,300 per ounce. Today its
around $1,160. That is how much The Gold Cartel has suppressed the
price. [35]
Mr. John Williams Shadow Government Statistics
website shows what we feel are real-world economic statistics, stripped of
the government and The First Sphere of Influences public-relations spin.
In one article, Mr. Williams stated that the
true inflation-adjusted price of gold should now be more than $6,000 an
ounce.[36]
The Great Collapse
In what Mr. Williams terms The Great Collapse, one of the consequences of
very high gold prices, among other economic indicators, he states:
The U.S. economic and systemic solvency
crises of the last two years are just precursors to a Great Collapse: a
hyperinflationary great depression.
Such will reflect a complete collapse in the
purchasing power of the U.S. dollar, a collapse in the normal stream of
U.S. commercial and economic activity, a collapse in the U.S. financial
system as we know it, and a likely realignment of the U.S. political
environment.
The current U.S. financial markets,
financial system and economy remain highly unstable and vulnerable to
unexpected shocks. The Federal Reserve is dedicated to preventing
deflation, to debasing the U.S. dollar.
The results of those efforts are being seen
in tentative selling pressures against the U.S. currency and in the
rallying price of gold.
Further support by Mr. Williams for the belief
that deliberate government actions are accelerating the coming depression:
In the midst of the crises, the Obama
Administration has introduced major new government programs, ranging
from carbon tax plans to a national health care and insurance program.
Irrespective of any stated goals of not
increasing the federal deficit further, these programs will have
severely negative impact on the federal deficit, either from massive net
expenses, or from losses in tax revenues in a weaker economy.
Hyperinflation is definitely on its way:
The intensifying economic and solvency
crises, and the responses to both by the U.S. government and
the Federal
Reserve in the last two years, have exacerbated the governments
solvency issues and moved forward my timing estimation for the
hyperinflation to the next five years, from the 2010 to 2018 timing
range estimated in the prior report.
The U.S. government and Federal Reserve
already have committed the system to this course through the easy
politics of a bottomless pocketbook, the servicing of big-moneyed
special interests, gross mismanagement, and a deliberate and ongoing
effort to debase the U.S. currency.
Accordingly, risks are particularly high of
the hyperinflation crisis breaking within the next year. [37]
Why Must the Second Great
Gold Rush Matter to You?
My dear friends, the bankers within our own walls have been in charge far
too long, aiding The First Sphere of Influence and its higher authority.
And theyve ridden roughshod over us far too
long. Truth be told, what were seeing in 2010 isnt necessarily anything
new. Our ancestors had to put up with the same load of manure, too.
Unfortunately for them, they lacked the modern
communications tools we have today:
-
cell phones
-
Worldwide Web
-
email
-
satellite phones
-
Skype
-
MySpace
-
Twitter
-
Facebook
Even with these tools, Americans and ordinary
citizens the world over are still in the dark about the machinations of The
First Sphere of Influence and their minions.
Over the past 65 years alone, the US has engaged in numerous gold scandals:
-
The theft, concealment, storage, and
distribution of Japans gold, looted from various Asian countries.[38]
-
The Bank of Englands transfer of Czech
gold reserves to the Nazis was orchestrated by US lawyer and
soon-to-be Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his law firm,
Sullivan and Cromwell.[39]
-
Surreptitiously escorting Martin
Bormann, Hitlers private secretary and head of the Nazi Party
Chancellery, out of Germany on the final night and day of the war so
the Allies (or some other unknown group) could recover the Nazis
gold and wealth, stolen from victims and secreted into Swiss bank
accounts and vaults, all with the blessings of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt.[40] The Allies resmelted most of the Nazi
gold, although because of poor recordkeeping, an accurate accounting
may never be known.[41] [42]
These are just a few known transgressions. There
are dozens, if not hundreds, more that await our discovery and clinical
inspection.
The Seagraves offer a rather bleak commentary on our times:
Most Americans have no idea whats going on
and dont care, so long as they are entertained and fed. America is now
the biggest trouble maker in the world, Israel second.
Nobody faces up
to reality if they can find a way to slide around it. Everyone should
have a gold nest egg (Maple Leaves, Krugerrands, etc.) salted away, but
it would be stupid to put it in a bank. [43]
So why must the second gold rush matter to you,
my dear fellow Americans? Because it signals the beginning of the end of our
beloved dollar, which, as the Seagraves stated,
is toilet paper and until there is a new
global currency, the scammers who play the money and commodity markets
will be jacking rates up and down to enrich themselves even further.
Look at Goldman Sachs gaming away. [44]
In short, were headed for a major depression in
the United States, quite unlike anything this country has ever seen, and it
will take us decades to recover.
If we rely on the historical record of The First
Sphere of Influence to guide us, we can also expect another major war, which
will probably be started by Israel and/or the US against Iran. The excuse,
similar to the one we used to go march into and occupy Iraq, will be to
eradicate nuclear-weapons capability and thus preserve the safety of the
state of Israel in the Middle East.
Closer to home, we will see more restrictive legislation along the lines of
the Patriot Act of 2001 and the Homeland Security Act of 2002 that further
dismantles and wrecks our beloved Constitution and thus our rights as
American citizens.
You might recall the impressive Patriot Act,
which weighed in at a whopping 132 pages, not including all the supporting
materials, and was allegedly in response to the staged 9/11 attacks, which
had occurred only a month before.
If you read the Act, youll be struck by its
extreme detail, thoughtfulness, and thoroughness, an action that clearly
took much longer than a month to research, design, write, discuss among
members of Congress, pass and finally implement.
All those actions were performed by our US
government and took just over one month?
Really?
The following hypothesis is more likely: this bill had been prepared several
years in advance of the 9/11 attacks. Considering how long it has taken to
research, write and debate the healthcare bill of 2010 - several years - it
is highly unlikely that our own government was capable in any way of
establishing the Patriot Act in one month, in response to false-flag attacks
on American soil
on 11 September 2001.
And who would be charged with covering up or disseminating false and
misleading information about all this mess?
Mass media, which is owned by The First Sphere
of Influence, will continue to issue false and misleading information about
the plots and intrigues of the powers that be, while also withholding
important knowledge and details about these machinations. Savvy Americans
are turning to alternative media, much of it underground and well off the
radars of most people.
The financial gurus in this country are banding
together and airing their grievances, thoughts, ideas, hypotheses and
theories about what is happening today. Other sectors are slower to react,
but we see more and more people in business, engineering, medicine and
science migrating to non-mainstream media sources.
They trickle in a few a day, but that trickle
will soon lead to a flood as good people begin to educate themselves about
the ill deeds of The First Sphere of Influence.
Dont Shoot the
Messenger
Throughout history, the messenger of bad news has usually been the first
casualty.
The second casualty has been the news itself. If
your aim is to understand what happens behind the scenes of our US
government, you must embrace some new information that will be difficult to
chew, let alone swallow and assimilate within you.
Please keep an open mind, discard and abandon
previous knowledge that was force-fed to you in grade school and high
school, be willing to consider new and important information, and also take
the time from your hectic day - time you dont have - and connect all the
dots you discover in your journey to enlightenment.
When youre sufficiently full and well armed,
please share your knowledge with others in a very kind, patient, open and
accurate way.
Doubtless, youre considering where you could possibly find the time to do
anything other than what you normally do in your daily life. Who has time to
think about The First Sphere of Influence, let alone read an article or book
on the subject? It takes about 15 hours to get through the average 350-page
book.
Sitting under an umbrella or wading in the
gentle surf on vacation for two weeks a year may be the best and only time
you have to read, so
-
Would you really want to invest two and
a half days of your hard-earned time to pore over 100,000 words that
will only depress you beneath the sparkling waters of your bliss?
-
Do you really want to abandon all you
know about history and life, and adopt a whole new way of thinking,
one that will pit you against the largest and most powerful
government on the planet, not to mention the much larger and darker
force above it that rules all of humanity?
-
Are you sure you want to gamble away
your life and the lives of your family to fight a force thats been
building and plotting against We The People and our fellow citizens
of the world for many hundreds of years?
America, we have been programmed to love all
that mass media have dished out in every size and shape and flavor
imaginable, all conveniently available, like a Las Vegas vacation, 24/7/365:
-
ESPN
-
CNN
-
FoxNews
-
Glenn Beck
-
Oprah
-
Playboy Channel
-
HBO,
...plus the myriad distractions in the form of
toys, designer clothes, perfume, makeup, shoes, hot cars, fast boats, sexy
women, thrill rides, exotic shows, and, oh, so much more!
Step right up,
America!
We are comfortably numbed by
mass media, on a lifelong buzz that needs no
toke or shot or needle.
Its all easy accessible and in such abundance
that were absolutely overwhelmed with all that choice, all those empty
calories of nonsense and noise.
This is exactly the state that The First Sphere of Influence wishes for the
average American: more pliant, malleable, naïve, ignorant, passive,
apathetic, and just plain unresponsive to any ill deeds done to us.
Like boiling a frog slowly, The First Sphere of
Influence has reduced We The People to a dead, pulpy mass, no longer able to
resist on any level, let alone take its last breath. And all the while, they
are removing our Constitutional rights and freedom and liberty, separating
us from our hard-earned money, taxing us into bankruptcy and suicide,
kicking us out of our homes, and stripping us of any sense of dignity
remaining after such wholesale liquidation.
All in the name of domination.
What can you do to stop this senseless onslaught, my dear friends?
Remember, the first steps to changing anything are becoming aware of the
subject, then educating yourself as much and as accurately as possible.
Youre going to need a sizable store of munitions for the coming fight,
because its going to be a long and lonely struggle, with few if any rewards
at the finish of your life.
The best you can hope to do is make a small
contribution to humanitys uphill fight, with the hope and wish that someone
in the future will, with your kind benefaction in mind, body and soul,
somehow carry on bravely.
