This video reveals the plans of the international bankers to dominate the
entire world both economically and politically.
This charge is validated by
video clips from C-SPAN, showing,
...describing what they have in mind for the U.S. and the rest of the world, as
well.
The new world order system, of global
governance, is a system of 'global-to-local' authoritarian management of
populations.
Under this system, nation-states are meant to
completely lose their sovereignty and be regrouped into authoritarian
continental 'unions'. These unions will ultimately be managed by a world
government composed of global agencies: most notably, the UN, the IMF, and
the World Bank.
Most people will live in highly-surveilled and regulated 'Agenda
21 communities', that will operate on the same inhuman and
catastrophic principles that were applied to Soviet or Chinese communes.
The hierarchy of political and decision-making in the world will be as
follows:
-
world government
-
continental 'management'
-
community-level management
All for the benefit of the dominant minority of
international bankers that have been setting up this globalized system from
at least the late 1800s: go into the works of Professors Carroll Quigley
("Tragedy
and
Hope", "The
Anglo-American Establishment") and
Antony Sutton
("Wall Street" series
1 and
2).
This endgame is described in multiple publications, most notably by the UN
and by several of its aggregated organizations, such as the Club of Rome,
and the Tellus Institute.
