'Unseen Hand' Behind the New World Order"
There are certain sources in the
Council of Foreign Relations and
Trilateral Commission that want things that are going on known to
people. There has been knowledge given as to what the international
Bankers intend to do worldwide. There is one very powerful group of
people who literally hold the money control of every nation in the world.
They control most all the world governments
through finance. And for all intents and purposes they are the sole
government of the world, even at this time. You possibly have not realized
that fact as of yet, but you will. As you know from a previous chapter in
this book the
Federal Reserve System is a individually
owned corporation and it controls the money, the interest rates, the general
economy and the daily market prices of gold and silver.
It is NOT an agency of the United States
Federal Government; and it never has been! It is a privately-owned
corporation.
Supposedly, thirteen families which are thought to control the central banks
and the hard currency countries of the world. It is commonly thought that
they own the majority of the stock and control the regional banks of the
Federal Reserve System. It is proven knowledge that anytime someone or a
group of people are involved in the organization of a scheme, they use
sacrificial lambs for the public viewing so as that the person or persons
that are orchestrating the whole show are never seen or known.
This is the case with the Federal Reserve System
in America, which has interlocking controls globally because it is all part
of one parent that traverses the globe, Railroads. And there is a monopoly
held for Railroads and Banking.
All of the people and banking houses that appear
to be separate entities are all part of this parent; how they became
involved goes all the way back to the early 1800s and the great grand
parents in the family bloodline that were hired by the Payseur family
to become life estate Trustees, based on 99 year leases and Trusteeships
expiring June 17, 1993 and December 31, 1993, for certain banks and
corporations that reach around the globe. (see
Lewis Cass Payseur and His Assets - 1850-1939)
All these families were trustee for the
Payseur conglomerate. These Trustees do not really own these
corporations or banks; they are all in Trust.
The group of heir Trustees listed below control the policy-making and
decision making of the central banks of the leading nations of the world.
-
Lehman Brothers Bank of New York
-
Kuhn, Loeb Bank of New York
-
Chase Manhattan Bank of New York
-
Boldman, Sachs Bank of New York
-
Chemical Bank of New York
-
Citibank Bank of New York
-
Schroder Banking of New York
-
Brown Brothers & Harriman
-
William S. Sneath
-
Wachovia Bank
-
Warburg Bank of Hamburg and Amsterdam
-
Israel Moses Self Banks of Italy
-
Lazares Brothers Banks of Paris
-
Rothschild Banks of London and Berlin
One short note about
the Rothschilds at this time, the last bank
mogul and tyrant of the Rothschilds was murdered sometime in 1990 and there
is someone else controlling now, not a Rothschild.
The above-listed banking houses, to an extent,
manipulate the daily prices of gold and silver on the exchange. The hard
currency countries are those countries whose currency is not allowed to
fluctuate as much as the other countries currency fluctuates.
The American dollar is the standard for all of
the currency in the world. Wherever the American dollar goes, it affects
other nations in relation to our dollar. These corporations, banks and
railroads reach into almost every country of the world at this time; they
have control of these countries.
They practice fractional reserve banking.
Fractional Reserve
Lending
Fractional Reserve Lending, an exclusive ability of only Federal
Reserve member institutions, is wholly and solely responsible for the fact
that the nations money supply in circulation is in fact comprised over 97%
credit for which nowhere on earth has there ever existed the printed
currency equivalent.
Today, every lending institution in America
practices this, and that doesnt include the interest on the debts, that is
only the principal.
Where does the interest come from?
You know it as the National Debt.
Federal Reserve and The Nigerian Coup
It was fractional reserve lending which was
swiftly instituted immediately before a pentagon official and three other
U.S. government officials and the New York bankers went to the Prime
Minister of Nigeria in the 1970s.
They gave him $50,000,000 to more than double
the price of their light crude oil. This crude oil from Nigeria is one of
the most valuable crude oils in the world. And this was all done immediately
prior to losing his life in a coup which was orchestrated by U. S. covert
para-military personnel trained in Belize (the British Honduras).
Shortly after the Prime Ministers death U.S.
officials had flown on to Kuwait and persuaded its oil producers to sell
their oil at the inflated price of $30 per barrel.
Federal Reserve Lending and the Middle East
Why were these astute U.S. emissaries prepared to purchase the Arabs oil at
this greatly inflated price?
The answer is both awesome and terrifying. U.S.
government officials were prepared and authorized to agree to purchase the
oil form the Persian Gulf states and the United Arab Emirates upon two
seemingly innocuous conditions.
The first condition was that O.P.E.C. - which
was to have so much anti-Arab propaganda spewed up against it later was to
become a reality and insist that all oil sales worldwide were in the future
to be dollar denominated. The second and more sinister condition foisted
upon the unsuspecting Arabs was the U.S. oil companies purchasing the crude
would not remit the sales proceeds back to the Middle East and Third World
Nations.
Rather, the Arabs were invited as a prerequisite
of sale at the inflated price to purchase long-term, 20 and 30-year
Certificates of Deposit locked into their depositor banks. This
coincidental relationship arose between the controllers of the purchasing
oil companies and the controllers of the banks from which the Arabs chose
to purchase their 20 and 30-year C.D.s.
It is all part of the railroad and banking
monster created by
the Payseur family.
In simplest terms, what is this fractional reserve lending?
As evidenced by the fact that the money in
circulation cannot be matched with currency in existence save in a negative
ratio of about 66.6 to 1, it is fraud. Can you lend anyone $1 if 66.6 of it
has never been coined: The answer is yes if you are a member of The
Federal Reserve System.
An oil company issues a check for $1 million to an Arab sellers stateside
agent. The figures are crossed out of the oil companys account at. say.
Chase Manhattan and inserted into a 30-year Certificate of Deposit in the
Arabs name on the computer. The Arab has been paid.
Who then owns Standard Oil now known as Exxon?
Who then owns Chase Manhattan?
The answer to both questions is that they are
both lost in the maze of consolidated corporations of railroads known as
Southern Railway which is owned by the Payseur family. What happens
next? The crude is refined. The costs and profits are passed on to the U.S.
public. That dirty Arab Cartel is blamed. But at $2 per gallon it is the
oil companies account which receives the revenue.
Meanwhile, what is happening to that Arabs
account?
It shows $1 million. In fact the bank in our
example, Chase Manhattan, has deposited that $1 million-a-piece of paper
with $1 million written on it - to The Federal Reserve Clearing System which
pursuant to Fractional Reserve Lending Policy authorizes Chase Manhattan
to loan at x60 sixty million to Mexico, Brazil, the U.S. Congress -
whomever it pleases - promulgating the overwhelming falsehood that there is
too much currency in the market and not enough borrowers.
The banks particularly in the U.S. to which
their countries were indebted through the International Monetary Fund, were
calling for revisions and amendments to those nations constitutions; the
better to accommodate the corporate associates of those banks in those
corporations designs to establish operations within the nations concerned.
And those trusted pillars of society - The
Federal Reserve Members - for every $1 million recorded due in about 25
years to the Arab, has the burden of paying that Arab about $70,000 per year
and is only making from the government a staggering $6 million per year and
requiring at the same time $60 million per year as repayment because of
Trilateral originated policy issued by Congress.
This scenario exists because of those that have
seized control of the Federal Reserve and all the other corporations that
were originally organized by the Payseur family.
It is becoming clear now why in the early to mid 70s the price of gasoline
increased. The price increase of oil going to the Arabs would come right
back to their banks in 30-year Time Certificate deposits. Now, take a look
at what they did with those 30 year Time Certificates and you can start
realizing what has happened to the people of the world and the economy.
Sheif Yamani and the other oil barons did not know until in the late
70s and early 80s that the controlling interest of the New York banks is
held by the same Trustee who have the controlling interest in all the major
oil companies such as Standard Oil, which is really the only oil company
there is, all the others are just branches and subsidiary area of the
original Standard Oil Trust, that was said to have be broken up. It wasnt,
it just changed names moved around a bit and regrouped and is still owned by
L.C. Payseurs estate today and is known as Exxon Oil.
The Rockefellers claim they own it but
J. D. Rockefeller was just another Trustee in the oil aspect and as well
as the banking aspect for the Payseurs.
Its all the same tree.
Control of the Middle
East and Third World Countries
The bankers banks relied on the greed of the Third World country ministers
to mishandle the money because they wanted the Third World countries to go
bankrupt. Over the years, that manipulative greed has caused these countries
to be in the bankrupt position they are in today.
While the Third World nations were getting their
independence from England, France and America, and were setting up their own
governments. Its at that point the bankers of New York loaned them large
sums of money which had come to the banks through the Arabs as the result of
the high oil prices.
In 1983, it was discovered that a group of very quiet bank-holding
companies, formed by the International Bankers, were extending credit
wherever they felt like it and under whatever terms they felt like. These
bank holding companies were formed so that Chase Manhattan. Chemical Bank
and J.P. Morgan couldnt be held responsible for the Arabs money they had
been putting into their banks.
Authorized in Regulation Y, Section 225.4 of the
U.S. Code to extend such credits, the International Bankers formed holding
companies that would, in turn, loan out money to Third World nations knowing
that the Third World countries were going to go broke.
After they had destroyed the Shah of Iran
and had his countrys money in their banks, they loaned out ridiculous
amounts of money, determining that they were going to go broke and letting
the bank holding companies hold these loans, and knew what was going to
happen when the Third World countries would broke.
These companies were receiving loans from the prime banks in New York. With
this money, they were buying foreclosed real property in the form of
agricultural property and businesses with liquidations, foreclosures and
bankruptcies.
The purpose of one holding company was to loan money to the Third World
countries from the Arabs money through the New York banks. The second bank
holding company was for the purpose of borrowing money from the banks in
order to purchase farmland and farms, as well as certain corporations in the
U.S. that were making lots of money in this country. Farmland will continue
to make money, but now the bankers own and control all of these farms that
have gone broke through bank foreclosure schemes.
They plan to own all the land in the united
States anyway through the control of railroad land (that can never be sold
as the odd sections of land) and they hold the mortgages to all companies
and homes that are on even sections of land. Through bank foreclosures and
mergers of both solvent and insolvent financial institution they will in the
very near future, if they are not stopped, seize every piece of land they
dont already have control of or own.
They not only plan to ultimately control the
food supply of the world through seizure of all farms but finally take total
control of the people. And they havent stopped with the borders of the
united states; this is a global plan.
The Third World nations are also scheduled for
collapse. It appears that their plan for America is to keep cutting these
corporations back until one day they just completely shut down, and then
they will move the companies to the Third World nations, which they have
seized control of through banking and debt, and leave the united States to
become a Third World nation; it would be really easy to accomplish this.
The farms and businesses which were affected by
FDIC and FSLIC foreclosures, are under the direct control of
the Federal Reserve Board. It seems that all over America dozens of banks
are being bought on a weekly basis. Where did the bankers get the money to
buy these banks from? They are being bought with the high oil priced money
that goes to the Arabs which are then deposited into the New York banks.
They are buying banks that are intentionally
being closed throughout U.S. Some of these banks are still solvent. They are
buying the farmlands of America through the farmers who are becoming
bankrupt due to the high American dollars in relation to foreign currency.
They are doing it all with our own money which pays for gasoline at the
pumps, then goes to the Arabs, it is then deposited into the New York banks,
where it goes to these holding companies which purchase more American banks
that are going under today.
This plan was designed by the Trustees of the
banks and railroads that reach from this country around the globe. Around
1983, it was discovered through an emissary from president Marcos of
the Philippines and President Suharto and others from Indonesia that
they had a severe problem.
Their problem was that having borrowed all the
money they had borrowed from the banker in New York, they now needed more
money.
A representative from these banks had just
come to them and said they would forgive all of their past loans. They
were told that they cannot pay them back, they couldnt even pay back
the interest, and they certainly couldnt pay back the principal.
They said they wanted to make a bargain,
they would forgive our loans (which was the Arabs money in reality) and
forgive our loans principal and interest and that we never have to pay
it back, if we did the following.
-
Eliminate their own national currencies
and become dollar denominated and go to a debit card system instead
of a currency system. This would eliminate capital cash altogether.
-
If they would go to a unilateral
centralized credit card system. This was to be a part of their
Social Security system and part of their identity system, the debit
card, whereby everybody in the country would be synonymous with a
credit card number. Their central bank was to act as the wholesaler
for debt-based credit which would be extended to it by the new super
bank. This was announced by Paul Volker on October 27, 1985.
-
In order to help the economies of
those countries, the International Monetary Fund was going to
nominate external non domestic corporations to properly engineer,
exploit and excavate the Minerals from those countries in return for
perpetual royalties. This fits right into the scheme of things,
because the resources of minerals in this country is just about
depleted due to the mineral land companies that are owned by the
railroads have been stripping everything from the land for the past
100 years or more. Now, they have contrived a way to go into the
Third World nations and strip their lands for the next 100 or so
years. This is why the
Royal Family in England owns the
Amazon Basin.
Marcos realized what the bankers were trying to
do to him; if he gave them (perpetual) rights to all minerals of his
country, even though the New York bankers promised they would send in
corporations to develop these minerals, that the bankers would get the
profits off the minerals, but yet it would put the people of the
Philippines to work.
Marcos knew that if he gave them this
contract of perpetual rights that he was giving up the sovereignty of
his country to the New York bankers and the
International Monetary Fund.
Marcos, at this point, told them:
I will not do this. Get out of my
country.
It was only a matter of weeks before Marcos was
deposed of by riots incited by payments of the New York bankers themselves.
Do you see how this works?
If Marcos had agreed to the bankers terms and conditions, they would have
had their existing debts forgiven absolutely. New lines of credit were to be
extended to them and the new lines of credit were to be under better terms
and conditions. When they heard of the word perpetual and when they heard
the words totally forgiven, they recognized what was happening.
Another group of holding companies was operating
with the 403 previous group of holding companies, and they were given monies
by the New York bankers. The second group of holding companies were
receiving credit from the first group of holding companies to purchase
assets and liabilities from the prime banks. The only liabilities the
holding companies were holding were the liabilities of the loans made to the
Third World nations that could not be repaid and represented by the deposits
of the Arab nations.
The only assets they were buying were the assets
represented by the loans made to some of the debtor nations. The plan is
that the Third World countries default on their payments, (countries like
Brazil, Argentina, etc.), so the group of holding companies or the bank
holding companies are designed to collapse.
It then became clear, through people in the
Trilateral Commission, that the forgiveness, of the Third World
debts would eliminate the assets which were being purchased by this second
group of holding companies. This left them only with the liabilities that
were owed to the Middle East nations, being serviced by the prime banks.
When Third World nations say they cant pay the
bank holding companies, they are saying that they are bankrupt. Its at this
point that the International Bankers will tell the Arabs, that the bank
holding companies that were given your money (under those 30 year time
deposits of all those billions you have put into the New York banks) over
all these years, those bank holding companies just went broke, so as of
today, you are bankrupt.
The Arab nations had no idea that these liabilities were now owed by the
holding companies and that the debtor nations had stopped paying the prime
banks. The Arabs did not understand any of the inter-manipulation of bank
finances and world banking. Therefore, they have fallen for this line all of
these years, but now within the past few years, the Arabs have become aware
of what the bankers have done to them and want to tell the American people
what is happening and dont know how to.
Arrangements were made that the prime banks were
to act as servicing agents for the holding companies so that Third World
nations would not know that the holding companies were owed the money. The
effect of the elimination of assets of the second group of holding companies
is threefold. The holding companies would be insolvent (broke) and would
legally be able to declare themselves insolvent.
The holding companies would then say to the
bankers that they had just lost all of the Arabs money.
The New York bankers are legally not responsible
for that loss, because they had loaned the Arabs money to the banks holding
companies. The New York bankers will simply tell the Arabs that they are
bankrupt. The New York bankers can legally and legitimately avoid payment to
Middle Eastern nations and the Arabs.
The New York bankers had put the Arabs
money into the bank holding companies which they were not responsible for.
The Middle Easter Arab nations will have to
liquidate all their other assets. These assets are represented by U.S.
corporate ownership and many billions of dollars worth of U.S. stock and
farmlands, plus they have huge holdings on the New York stock exchange!
After the Arabs are declared bankrupt they will start dumping billions of
dollars worth of stocks on the New York stock exchange.
Our property, farmland that are already
depressed their monetary values will drop to the bottom of the barrel. Real
estate everywhere will drop in value by 80 to 85%, and when the value of
farmland starts dropping and go from $3,000 per acre to $300 per acre, the
farmer will not be able to finance his next crop because he will have no
more collateral.
What happens to the people when there is hunger
in the streets and the grocery store shelves are bare? Are you beginning to
see the scenario for control of the nations and the peoples of the world?
People will be killing each other for food.
Is that not World War III, and brother against
brother?
The effect of the Saudis and the Kuwaitis and the Middle Eastern peoples
sale of even 25% of their total holdings in the U.S. market would be
absolutely chaotic in terms of the stock market, real estate and everything
else.
The above outline is just one scenario that they have in place and ready to
go to crash our monetary system. I do know from inside sources that one plan
they have is when all the stocks on the stock exchange drop to $180.00 per
share they plan to collapse the market at that time.
So flip a coin, it could be anyone of a dozen
scenarios we only know of a few that can all have the same catastrophic
effect on the world.
Trusts vs. Anti-Trusts
The bankers possess control through a giant Trust system that was set up in
the 1870s. It took the Payseur family from say 1830 to 1870 to get
all the banks corporation etc. at that time set up and running they were
organizing monopolies. Then came the rash of Anti-Trust laws which made it
illegal for any one else to do what they were doing.
This did away with competition and they had been
in the business long enough that the Payseur companies and bank and railroad
were grandfathered in and could not be touched. In the 1970s there was
anti-trust legislation passed that abolished all of their past anonymity
supposedly if you could ever hope to find out the common ownership of all
the banks, railroads and global corporations.
At this time every one of these corporations are
in violation of anti-trust because they all have interlocking common
interest and a singular ownership. The one that controls the Federal Reserve
controls the world, the people on it and your every aspect of life. This is
done by the Springs family in North Carolina.
The ones that you will never hear about publicly
only the sacrificial lambs are known; the current front is President Bill
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
The Anti-Trust Laws before the mid 1970s is what allowed such banks as
Chase Manhattan, Chemical, J.P. Morgan and other banks in New York to show
all time record earnings, while around America literally hundreds of banks
(many that are solvent) and farmers as well are going broke?
The reason is that they know that there time
table is running out and that the leases to all these banks, railroads and
corporation is up on December 31, 1993 because of a merger between Southern
Railway and Norfolk Western to form Norfolk Southern Railway.
They are in a race for control.
The banks that are merging now are only merging
with themselves.
It is truly a common ownership, one bank with many names, because the
Payseurs had a government granted covenant, a monopoly on banks and
railroads. The railroads and the banks are owned by one family which was set
up on December 15, 1865 as the United States Military Railroad for
transportation and communication to run forever.
It was bought by the Payseur family and
this included the monopolies that interlocks all these aspects. This family
built the systems, corporations, railroad and banks and set up Trustees to
operate them and then leased all these out to run on 99 years leases which
are up on the above mentioned dates.
The Trustees thought all the Payseurs heirs were
dead and they could run away with the whole thing but then found out that if
there was not a new tenant of lease set up. All would revert back to the
government under the terms of the convenient, so they have now taken control
of the government. These Trustees think they have put themselves in a win,
win situation.
They never though that we the people would find
out what is really going on in the banking world nor who is really running
things.
They have been working very hard to get
themselves in a position to control the world. For a long time, since about
1925. These catastrophic effects have been designed to throw the American
stock market, the American public, corporations, American real estate and
people in general, into a state of panic and confusion because you are
suppose to lose everything to the New York bankers if you are in debt and do
not totally own free and clear land and home. etc..
The plan is that this state of confusion will be
greeted with the salvation of the benevolent bankers on three fronts.
According to all of the data that we have
gathered and because of the set backs that the bankers have suffered because
they just cant get everything into place fast enough, we know it has been
moved 18 months past the planned April 15, 1992, target date for the
consolidation of the European Economic Community.
The New York bankers tried again in the late
fall of 1992 to seize control of the European Economic Community and
failed, that is when our stock market went hay wire again. This is a battle
between old European money control and new American money control.
The Americas control is trying to take over the
world. It is our belief that if they are not able to seize control of the
world monetary system by the end of 1992 that it will possibly be either
around December 31, 1993 or June of 1994 based on the Railroad leases that
are due to be up at those times and based on the control they each hold.
The bankers want to do away with currency altogether and force the world to
go to the Debit Card.
