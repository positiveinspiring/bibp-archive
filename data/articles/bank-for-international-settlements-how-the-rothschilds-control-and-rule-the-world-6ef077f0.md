For decades, people have urged me, pushed me, prodded me, practically peeled off my skin, pulled out my eyes, and yanked out my brain to prove it, i.e. show them the data, the results, the books, manuals, pamphlets, journals, monographs, voice and video recordings, all the resources I have used to make the statements I do about the Brzezinski Cartel and the Rothschilds. On the evening of St. Patrick's Day 2010, I feel now is the time... but with a twist. The list below shows 165 different ways how The First Sphere of Influence (Rothschilds and Brzezinski Cartel) controls the world. One hundred and sixty-five reasons to believe what I say to be 100% accurate and true. Each entry is a separate and distinct central bank, located in a separate and distinct part of the world. These central banks cover the globe and know absolutely no boundaries, effectively erasing borders between even sworn enemies. The Bank of International Settlements or BIS (pronounced BIZZ) is the Rothschild's piggy bank, a veritable deep-pit mine, the equivalent of quadrillions of dollars.
DEFINITION: quadrillion quad·rillion adj. 1. The cardinal number equal to 1015. 2. Chiefly British. Septillion.

What's the significance of having a central bank within a country and why should you concern yourself, your family and colleagues? Central banks are illegally created PRIVATE banks that are owned by the Rothschild banking family. The family has been around for more than 230 years and has slithered its way into each country on this planet, threatened every world leader and their governments and cabinets with physical and economic death and destruction, and then emplaced their own people in these central banks to control and manage each country's pocketbook. Worse, the Rothschilds also control the machinations of each government at the macro level, not concerning themselves with the daily vicissitudes of our individual personal lives. Except when we get too far out of line. The grand plan of The First Sphere of Influence is to create a global mononation. Please do not confuse this with the term globalization. Mononation and globalization couldnt be more different in concept, scope and purpose. Mononation is one state. It has one government. One set of laws for all ordinary citizens, no laws for the elite. Globalization refers to communicating, trading, interacting, etc. among separate, different, independent, sovereign countries. The grand plan of The First Sphere of Influence is to create a global mononation. Our own Federal Reserve is an illegally emplaced private bank that is directly responsible for creating all the USs depressions, recessions, and the inflation and deflation of our dollar. The Fed controls the printing of our own currency, and then charges the US government interest on those loans.
The interest is growing each year, making it difficult if not impossible for our government to pay it.
How do we pay this interest? By the US Personal Income Tax. This tax goes to the Rothschild family. In the coming months, as I continue to gather intel and write a book about The First Sphere of Influence, I will share more and more. For now, I kindly ask that you read each of the 165 lines below. One hundred and sixty-five reasons to believe my intel.
You can click on each bank and visit its website. Ive seen each one. Theyre real. And theyre one of the reasons why each country is in such deep debt to this insidious family, the Rothschilds. By the way, if you're curious what the US debt is to the BIS, please refer to the table at the end of this article, taken from the latest statistical results provided by the Joint External Debt Hub, which receives data from the,
