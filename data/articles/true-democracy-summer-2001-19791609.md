Aquarius Group
UFO Technology application scientists, reportedly working under the guidance
of the Dolphin Society, an elite gourp of scientists privy to extremely classified
science and technology findings. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has several
Geosynchronous Orbiting Environmental Satellites (GOES) in orbit watching
the Earth's weather and environment. On November 21, 1999, at 14:45Z
hours our satellites caught an amazing photo of a UFO at an estimated
hundred miles above the Earth off the coast of the state of Washington.
The
University of Colorado also keeps these photos on file for reference.
One of the satellites is designed to pick up water vapor or clouds
from space. When Russel Kirchner caught sight of the UFO in the display
he zoomed in and could see the steam coming off a UFO. It was of the
type identified as a large Mother Ship. The possibility of the object
image being caused by a computer error was discussed and ruled out.
Similar photos taken on June 8, 1995, over South America have also
been widely distributed. Philip Imbrogno studied this case and NOAA
explained the image was a "moon shadow UFO."
This
UFO was present for only a few minutes and is not seen in images taken
prior or afterwards. The UFO has structure, windows, and radiates
heat in the infrared spectrum. Thanks to Russel Kirchner. http://http://www.goes.noaa.gov/
