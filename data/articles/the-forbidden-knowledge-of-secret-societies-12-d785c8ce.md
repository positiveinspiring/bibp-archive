# The Forbidden Knowledge of Secret Societies - 12

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/secretsoc/secretsoc12.htm

Many people believe that
quite a few of the Templars and their secrets escaped to Scotland, and the
dawning of a new age of Freemasonry emerged in later years - thought to be
directly from the Templars.
In the year 1314, King Edward of England invaded Scotland, hoping to bring
an end to the border battles. Meeting the Scottish army at Bannock Burn, he
was surprised by a force of well-trained men fighting for the Scots. The
tide turned and Scotland achieved independence, if only for three years. The
standard history has it that these well-trained men that turned the tide
against the well-trained English army were nothing more than camp followers
and servants.
Many, though, now believe that these were the famous Knights
Templar, who had taken root in Scotland and hidden away from Catholic
tyranny. Strangely, immediately after the battle, Robert the Bruce, the new
Scottish king, rewards the Sinclair family with lands near Edinburgh and Pentland, the very same lands associated with hundreds of Templar graves,
sites, symbols, and much more, such as Balantrodoch (a temple).
An indication of the popular liking for the Templars is shown in the
Peasants Revolt of Wylam Tyler in A.D. 1381, when a mob marched in protest
of the oppressive taxes placed upon them.
Strangely, they did not harm the
old Templar buildings, but turned their attentions on those of the Catholic
Church. In one instance, they actually carried things out of a Templar
church in London to burn the items in the street, rather than damage the
building. It may be that this uprising was a natural incident, or it may be
that it was inspired by the actions of a hidden and now secret society of
the Templars - hidden because of the new Catholic hatred towards them.
If it
is the case that the Templars did indeed inspire this revolt, then, even
though they were not successful, they tried again 100 years later, and
forced the Reformation. It was around this period (15th century) that the
first records of Scottish and York Masonic meetings appear.
Lets take a rather sideways look at the history and symbolism of the
Templars.
There are some strange links between Sumerian iconography and Templar
symbolism that need to be voiced. The most obvious Templar imagery is that
of the two poor knights seated upon a horse, which is very similar to the
idea and concept of two riders seen in ancient Sumeria.
This was purely a
tactical device in warfare - although there may be some truth in believing
that it has origin in the balance hypothesis of the twins.
The Templar
cross is equally seen in many Sumerian images normally associated with an
upturned crescent moon. The Fleur de Lys is also a common image, as well as
bees, which were common also to the Merovingians. The pentagram is also seen
in the images of both, and symbolized the essence of the Merovingians as the
Shining Ones.
Another symbol seen in various forms from Sumeria to France is the Abraxus -
a figure with snakes for legs - a symbol used for gods such as Oannes, and,
not surprisingly, this later became the symbol of the Grand Master of the
Templar Order.
What could this mean? That the head of the Order of the Templars saw himself as the chief of the serpents? And what was another name
for the head serpent? Pendragon!
In essence, the Master of the Templars was
therefore not only by literary means including the Templars as the knights
who would protect the Grail, but also himself as Arthur and vice versa.
In conjunction with the fact that the Templars also used the serpent symbol
of eternity and immortality (the snake eating its own tail), we have a
serpent secret being held by the very highest of Christian guardians.
The Cross of Lorraine, a symbol used by the Templars before their usual
Maltese-style cross, is seen in Sumeria as a symbol for kingship. These
influences must have been picked up while the Templars were in the Middle
East and utilized later on. We know that they used the sign, because the
trials in the early 1300s had the prisoners etching the symbol into the cell
walls.
What other ancient secrets did they collect?
An article by Boyd Rice titled The Cross of Lorraine: Emblem of the Royal
Secret mentions that the Cross of Lorraine, apart from being a symbol of
poison, was the emblem of heraldry for Rene DAnjou, said by Charles Peguy
to represent the arms of both Christ and Satan and the blood of both. It is
also said to incorporate the symbol phi or the Golden Ratio of Sacred
Geometry - so very important to the Masons.
Rene dAnjou was keenly aware of
and interested in many things occult. He led a search for new (old) hermetic
texts. The Cross of Lorraine was taken on by Rene, and, subsequently, by
Marie de Guise, the wife of James Stuart V (parents of Mary Queen of Scots),
for its occult symbolism. This occult symbolism showed the cross to be
representative of poison.
Proof of this meaning comes also from the fact
that it became an icon used by chemists (originally alchemists) on the
bottles of poisonous substances. The idea is hidden in the duality. Why
would monarchs and Templars use a sign for poison, if that poison did not
have an opposite side? That of cure!
Later on in the early 20th century, Aleister Crowley, the arch Magus and self-proclaimed British Alchemist,
would assign this very same symbol as the Sigil of Baphomet - the Templars
own icon of adoration.
The Cross of Lorraine is also thought to be a sign of
secrets; a sign of the Angelic Race, which came down and posited wisdom and
the secrets of immortality upon the Royal Bloodline. According to Boyd Rice
it is a sigil of that Royal Secret, the doctrine of the Forgotten Ones.
And for this reason it seems peculiar that in the 1940s Charles de Gaulle
should make it the official symbol of the French Resistance.
Of course we
now know that these angelic beings were Elohim/Shining Ones or Watchers,
and that the underground stream of knowledge from these, right up to the
medieval period and probably beyond, is derived from Sumeria.
Baphomet
This mysterious object was said to have been venerated by the Templars and
to have been written about extensively for the past 30 years. It was thought
to be a skull, by some.
One possible explanation for the origin of the word could strangely be found
in the deserts of Yemen. The people who live here are called the Al-Mahara,
and they have developed many ways of combating snake poison. The special
snake priests are called Raaboot men, and they are said to have learned the
secret from father to son. Their legends state that they have immunity from
snakebites.
If somebody is bitten, then a Raaboot man is called upon, who then sits by
the patient, along with several others who then chant in a monotone voice,
Bahamoot, Bahamoot. The poison is then vomited up or passed out of the
body in the other direction. The Raaboot man then leaves. Again here, as I
have pointed out before, the snake is said to have a jewel in its head,
indicative of the enlightenment aspect.
Is it not possible that Bahamoot, as a chant for the curing of snakebites,
could have made its way through the various cultures and found itself as a
word for the head serpent? - The same head serpent that the Templars
worshipped?
If nothing else, then the etymology of these two related items is so similar
that it again shows, in the language of the serpent cult, a worldwide
spread.
Friday the 13th, October 1307, was a terrible day for the Knights Templar as
King Philip IVs men descended upon all of the Orders French holdings,
seizing property and arresting each of its members. Why? Simply because
Philip owed them huge amounts of money and had no way of paying them back.
To add to this he had hoped that the infamous Templar treasure would be his.
With the help of his puppet, Pope Clement V, the French king tortured the
knights to discover their secrets. Finally, to justify his action, the
knights were accused of heresy, homosexual practices, necromancy, and
conducting bizarre rituals such as desecrating the cross - as if to show
their lack of faith in this Christian icon. This was, however, a method of
initiation and not a heretical act.
The most unusual and perplexing evidence they came across was the worship of
this idol called Baphomet. This strange thing - although sometimes
referred to as a cat or goat - was generally seen as a severed head.
In the Magic of Obelisks, Peter Tompkins says:
Public indignation was aroused...the Templar symbol of Gnostic rites based
on phallic worship and the power of directed will. The androgynous figure
with a goats beard and cloven hooves is linked to the horned god of
antiquity, the goat of Mendes.
The list of charges used by the Inquisition in 1308 reads:
Item, that in
each province they had idols, namely heads.
Item, that they adored these
idols or that idol, and especially in their great chapters and assemblies.
Item, that they venerated (them)
Item, that they venerated them as God.
Item, that they venerated them as their Savior.
Item, that they said that
the head could save them.
Item, that it could make riches.
Item, that it
could make the trees flower.
Item, that it made the land germinate.
Item,
that they surrounded or touched each head of the aforesaid idol with small
cords, which they wore around themselves next to the shirt or the flesh.
Some said it was a mans head, but others a womans head. Some said that it
was bearded, others nonbearded. Some presumed that it was made from glass
and that it had two faces.
This general mixing of ideas shows where the idea
of the head could have come from. That it was a mans head or a womans,
indicates its dual nature - and much like the ancient Celtic heads, it
would incline me to the opinion that it emerged from part of the supposed
ancient head cult.
The Celts, it is said, believed, as did the Hindus, that the soul resided in
the head. They would decapitate their enemies and keep their heads as
talismans. Probably the best-known head in Celtic lore is that of Bran the
Blessed, which was buried outside London - some say in Tower Hill - facing
towards France. It was put there to see off the plague and disease and to
ensure that the land was fertile - the same powers that were attributed to
the Green Man.
Bearded and nonbearded simply indicates again the dual nature, as does
the idea that it was two-faced, like the god Janus.
It was apparently
called Caput 58 (Caput meaning Head), indicating that there may have been
possibly hundreds of them. There are also strong links with Islam at this
time; links that the Templars should probably not have made in their
supposedly Christian world.
It is also said that the name Baphomet was derived from Mahomet - an Old
French corruption of the name of the prophet Mohammed. Others claim that it
comes from the Arabic word abufihamet, which means Father of
Understanding.
In all likelihood, though, Baphomet comes from baphe meaning to submerge and
mete meaning wisdom.
The Baphoment being a device for the Gnostic tradition
or belief of being submerged in wisdom, is associated with the concept of
the Sophia or wisdom goddess.
The Symbol of the Cross
We now turn to the cross, for there is great depth to its history and
mythology that may well reveal more secrets of the Freemasons and Templars.
Today the world is going mad for all things Knights Templar. They have never
been so popular. Everywhere you turn theres a new book, poster, T-shirt,
and even mug with their infamous red cross on a white background. But this
wasnt their only symbol, and I discovered that there was even greater truth
to be found behind this enigmatic imagery and, believe it or not, it had
nothing at all to do with Dan Brown.
I begin my quest with a familiar symbol to many people: the ankh. Today
there are millions of people walking around with this unique and extremely
important symbol on chains around their necks, and it is deeply embedded in
the secret societies of the world, including the Freemasons, Rosicrucians,
and many more.
Even Christians adorn themselves with the image, thinking it
to be a normal cross. And yet the significance of the symbolism implied by
this seemingly unobtrusive little object is very profound.
This enigmatic symbol of Egypt represents eternal life and was often found
in the names of Pharaohs such as the infamous Tut-ankh-amun.
The symbol is often depicted being held by a god
to a Pharaoh, giving him life, or held out by a Pharaoh to his people,
giving them life - this basically set aside the immortals, from the mortals,
for anyone wearing or carrying the ankh had gained or hoped to gain
immortality. Those holding the ankh were the great magicians, the ones
capable of altering reality.
They had the power of the Otherworld through the
device, which symbolized
the access to the Otherworld. So, what elements of this ankh give it this
special power?
Author at a Templar castle in Portugal
The ankh is technically known as the Crux Ansata.
It is a simple T-cross,
surmounted by an oval - called the Ru. The Ru is often seen as the portal or
gateway to another dimension such as heaven - in essence, the Otherworld.
The ankh therefore becomes the symbol of transition from one plane to
another. It outlived Egyptian domination and was widely used by the
Christians as their first cross, but in this symbol holds a clue to the
secret of the serpent.
One character intricately linked with the ankh, and specifically the Tau
cross, is Thoth or Taautus - a character no different from the alchemists
and Greeks Hermes or the biblical Enoch, both of whom were transported to
other worlds in ways similar to modern altered states of consciousness, and
both of whom are spoken of again and again by the secret societies.
Amazingly, Thoth was said, by Eusebius, to be the originator of serpent
worship in Phoenicia, and this will prove to be of worth.
Sanchoniathon
called him a god and says that he made the first image of Coelus 1 and
invented hieroglyphs. This links him with Hermes, whom I mentioned
previously. Thoth also consecrated the linked species of dragons and
serpents; and the Phoenicians and Egyptians followed him in this
superstition.
This Thoth could very well be a memory of the first group who originated the
worship of the serpent after the flood or the end of the last ice age
approximately 12,000 years ago. Thoth was deified after his death (a time
that nobody knows, if he existed) and given the title the god of health or
healing.
He was the prototype for the serpent-linked healer, Aesculapius,
and identified with Mercury, who bore the serpent-entwined caduceus: All
healers, all wise, all teachers, all saviors, and all associated with the
serpent for their powers. Indeed, it was as the healing god that Thoth was
symbolized as the serpent - he was normally represented with the head of an
ibis and baboon.
The letter or symbol Tau is the first letter of Taautus, Tammuz, and
Thoth, and is thought to be the Mark of Cain, who was called the son of
serpents. In many respects, it is also linked with the ancient swastika, so
well-known to us now from Nazi imagery.
We shall soon discover that the
Nazis themselves began life as a secret society.
Swastika
The ancient symbol of the swastika is simply a stylized spiral, as can be
shown from the many depictions across the world of swastikas made up of
spirals and snakes.
It also shows up in the spiral fashions of the
labyrinths and mazes. The word labyrinth comes directly from the ancient
Minoan Snake Goddess culture of Crete, where the swastika was used as a
symbol of the labyrinth and is linked etymologically with the double headed
axe - which is none other than the Tau cross. Similar labyrinthine
swastikas have been found in the ancient city of Harappa from 2000 B.C.
As
the labyrinth is viewed as a womb of the Mother Goddess, and a symbol of the
snake, there is little wonder that these two symbols became fused. However,
labyrinths were also seen as places of ancient serpent initiation. In
ancient Egypt, the labyrinth was synonymous with what was called the Amenti
- the snake-like path taken by the dead to journey from death to
resurrection.
It was Isis, the serpent queen of heaven, who was to guide the
souls through the twists of the Amenti.
The path towards the center leads
towards treasure.
The snake adorning Athene in ancient Greece is shown with a swastika skirt.
The same is true of Astarte or Asherah and Artemis. There is Samarran
pottery dating from 50004000 B .C . from Mesopotamia showing a female and
swastika, on which the females hair swirls with Medusa-type serpents. The
swastika is also shown as two serpents crossing each other.
In Norse myth, the hammer of Thor, 2 Mjollnir, is closely connected with the
swastika and is found to be a prominent motif in Scandinavian art from the
Bronze Age to the Iron Age. It is found on swords and Anglo-Saxon cremation
urns and on numerous Viking items. It was seen as a protector against
thieves, reminiscent of the fact that serpents were known to guard treasure.
As Thors hammer was also seen as a Tau cross, it is certainly related to
the secrets of the serpent. It was used by Thor to lop off the head of the
sacred ox, which he used as bait to catch the Midgard Serpent, which
encircled the globe in the symbol of the Ouroboros, eating its own tail.
This was Thor offering a head as sacrifice to the serpent to try to gain
immortality in the mead - the drink of the gods.
He was using the serpent to
catch the serpent. It was the cessation of the constant cycling of the Midgard Serpent that Thor attempted and, in this way, he beat time itself.
Thors aim was to gain a cauldron big enough to take the mead for the
immortals, and he needed to prove his worth by fishing for the serpent. He
had power over the serpent as the slayer with the swastika or Tau cross.
There is evidence to prove that the myths of these Scandinavians and the
Hindus are related, as the story of Thor and the Midgard Serpent closely
resemble the battle between Indra and Vritra, showing a common origin.
Vritra is the great serpent, which lies at the source of two rivers (the
positive and negative, or male and female), as the Midgard Serpent lies
beneath the sea (of the mind). Indra slits open the belly of the serpent to
release the waters and therefore fertility back to the land. Both gods (Indra
and Thor) are related to the weather, both are warrior gods with a
thunderbolt as a weapon, and both slay the dragon.
The swastika of the
serpent is a common motif in both Hindu and Scandinavian cultures.
Eventually, the Christians steal both Pagan myths and place St. Michael and
St. George in their place - both having the red serpent cross to replace the
swastika.
The cross is also found in the legends of Thoth or Taautus, who was said to
have symbolized the four elements with a simple cross, which originated from
the oldest Phoenician alphabet as the curling serpent.
Indeed Philo adds
that the Phoenician letters,
are those formed by means of serpents
and
adored them as the supreme gods, the rulers of the universe.
If Thoth,
Hermes, and even Enoch are the supposed inventors of the art of writing,
then there is little wonder that they are so closely linked with the
serpent.
Victoria de Bunsen in the 19th century thought,
the forms and movements of
serpents were employed in the invention of the oldest letters, which
represent gods.
This symbol of the four elements was altered slightly and
became the Egyptian Taut, the same as the Greek Tau, which is where we get
the name Tau cross from - a simple T.
The T or Tau cross also gives its name to the bull in the astrological sign
of Taurus - note here the two elements of the Tau and the Ru being brought
together. The Druids (or adders, after the snake) venerated the tree and
the snake by scrawling the Tau cross into tree bark.
In the Middle Ages, the Tau cross was used in amulets to protect the wearer
against disease.
Among the modern Freemasons the Tau has many meanings. Some say that it
stands for Templus Hierosolyma or the Temple of Jerusalem. Others say that
it signifies hidden treasure or means Clavis ad Thesaurum,
A key to
treasure or Theca ubi res pretiosa, A place where the precious thing is
concealed.
It is especially important in Royal Arch Masonry where it becomes the
Companions Jewel:
a serpent as a circle above the cross bar in place of
the Ru and forming the ankh with the Hebrew word for serpent engraved on
the upright, and also including the Triple Tau - a symbol for hidden
treasure.
It was also the symbol for St. Anthony - later to become the symbol for the
Knights Templar of St. Anthony of Leith in Scotland.
St. Anthony lived in
the 4th century A.D. and is credited with establishing Monasticism in Egypt,
and the story goes that he sold all his possessions after hearing from the
Lord and marched off into the wilderness to become a hermit. On his travels,
he learned much from various sages in Egypt and grew for himself a large
following. He was sorely tempted by the devil in the form of creeping
things and serpents.
In one episode, he follows a trail of gold to a
temple, which is infested with serpents, and takes up residence, needing
little food for sustenance other than bread and water. He is said to have
lived 105 years, and due to this longevity he is credited with protective
powers.
The Order of the Hospitalers of St. Anthony, who would later take much of
the Templar wealth, brought many of Anthonys relics to France in the 11th
century. Previously they were said to have been secretly deposited somewhere
in Egypt just after his death and then later to have found their way to
Alexandria. All of this is a symbolic representation of the truth.
The
truth, in fact, is that the secrets of these stories found their way to
Alexandria, which was a mixing bowl of the occult, esoteric, Gnostics and
mystical world, and from there it spread into Europe via such movements as
the Templars, Rosicrucians, and later the Freemasons - hence the reason for
finding the symbolism in the Companions Jewel.
The Taut or Tau symbolizes the four creating elements of the universe. It is
the center of all this creation, it is the spark in the cycle, the very
center of all. Next, the symbol of the solar-serpent was added: a simple
circle or the oval Ru.
This loop above the T-cross created the ankh, the
symbol of eternity. The snake in a circle eating its own tale is symbolic of
the sun and immortality.
Eventually, the symbol of the moon was added to this, turning it into the
sign for Hermes or Mercury and showing the Caduceus/ serpent origin. It is
no wonder that this, the most perfect and simple of symbolic devices, became
the symbol of the early Christians. It is also no wonder that, even though
there were no cross-beam crucifixions, Christ was nevertheless symbolically
crucified on a symbol of eternal life, a symbol of the serpent.
This symbol became the mark or sign that would set the believer aside for
saving. In Ezekiel, this is the mark that God will know, the mark on the
forehead. As Deane points out, the Ezekiel passage (9:4) should read,
set a
Tau upon their foreheads or mark with the letter Tau the foreheads.
The
early Christians baptized with the term crucis thaumate notare. 3
They
baptized with the symbol of the snake.
Is this the original mark of Cain, which we have found elsewhere, to be of
the serpent tribe?
The idea of this sign or mark is widespread once discovered. In Job 31:35,
we read in our modern King James Bibles I sign now my defence - let the
Almighty answer me, which should properly read,
Behold, here is my Tau,
let the Almighty answer me. He then goes on to say, Surely I would take it
upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
This remarkable idea of wearing the Tau cross on the shoulder as a sign
would later become part and parcel of the crusader Templars markings.
Also,
the Merovingians (said by some to be descended from Jesus and a sea serpent
or fish god - the Quinotaur or Quino-Tau-r) were supposedly born with a red
cross between their shoulder blades.
The Tau cross is also strangely used by
those practicing sacred geometry as a marker for buried treasure, whether
physical or spiritual.
Sacred geometry at play upon this Masonic tomb in St. Peters, Rome
This buried treasure is truly the center, the point in our minds and hearts
where we find the original self.
This original center (heart means center)
was seen to be connected to the Universal Mind, and only by accessing this
center of ourselves could we access the Universal Mind or God. This in turn
stops time, we become one with all, and we believe we are immortal.
The Tau
marks this place, either on the forehead or in the chest (between the
shoulders), revealing to others those who can access the point in time where
God resides.
The word temple from whence Templar derives has another
meaning: tempos simply means time. The true temple is that place that has
power over the cycling energy of the serpent.
The true temple, like the one
on our brow, is within us.
