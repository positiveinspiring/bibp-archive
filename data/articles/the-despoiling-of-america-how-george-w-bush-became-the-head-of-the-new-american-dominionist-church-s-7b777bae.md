The First Prince of
the Theocratic States of America
It happened quietly, with barely a mention in the media. Only the Washington
Post dutifully reported it.[1] And only Kevin Phillips saw its
significance in his new book, American Dynasty.[2] On December
24, 2001, Pat Robertson resigned his position as President of the christian
Coalition.
Behind the scenes religious conservatives were abuzz with excitement. They
believed Robertson had stepped down to allow the ascendance of the President
of the United States of America to take his rightful place as the head of
the true American holy christian church.
Robertsons act was symbolic, but it carried a secret and solemn revelation
to the faithful. It was the signal that the Bush administration was a
government under God that was led by an anointed President who would be the
first regent in a dynasty of regents awaiting the return of Jesus to earth.
The President would now be the minister through whom God would execute His
will in the nation. George W. Bush accepted his scepter and his sword with
humility, grace and a sense of exultation.
As Antonin Scalia, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
explained a few months later, the Bible teaches and christians believe,
"
that government
derives its moral
authority from God. Government is the 'minister of God'
with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including even wrath by
the sword
" [3]
George W. Bush began to
wield the sword of Gods revenge with
relish from the beginning of his administration, but most of us missed the
sword play.
I have taken the liberty to paraphrase an
illustration from
Leo Strauss, the father of the neo-conservative
movement, which gives us a clue of how the hiding is done:
"One ought not to say to those whom one
wants to kill, Give me your votes, because your votes will enable me to
kill you and I want to kill you, but merely, Give me your votes, for
once you have the power of the votes in your hand, you can satisfy your
desire." [4]
Notwithstanding the advice, the Presidents
foreign policy revealed a flare for saber rattling.
He warned the world that,
"nations are either with us or theyre
against us!"
His speeches, often containing allusions to
biblical passages, were spoken with the certainty of a man who holds the
authority of Gods wrath on earth, for he not only challenged the evil
nations of the world, singling out Iraq, Syria, Iran, and North Korea as the
"axis of evil," but he wielded the sword of punishment and the sword of
revenge against his own people: the American poor and the middle class who
according to the religious right have earned Gods wrath by their
licentiousness and undisciplined lives.
To the middle class he said,
"Im going to give you clear skies clean air
and clean water," then he gutted the environmental controls that were
designed to provide clean air and water. The estimated number of
premature deaths that will result: 100,000.[5]
He said to the
poor and to the middle class:
"Im going to give you a prescription drug
program, one that you truly deserve."
Then he gave the drug industry an estimated $139
billion dollars in increased profits from the Medicare funds and arranged
for the poorest of seniors to be eliminated from coverage, while most
elderly will pay more for drugs than they paid before his drug benefit bill
passed.[6]
After that he arranged for the dismantling of
the Medicare program entirely, based on the method outlined by his religious
mentors.[7] He said to the people of America, "Im going to build
a future for you and your children," then he gutted their future with tax
breaks to the rich and a pre-emptive war against Iraq, and the largest
spending deficit in history.[8]
This article is the documented story of how a political religious movement
called
Dominionism gained control of the Republican Party, then took over
Congress, then took over the White House, and now is sealing the conversion
of America to
a theocracy by taking over the American Judiciary.
Its the story of why and how "the wrath of God
Almighty" will be unleashed against the middle class, against the poor, and
against the elderly and sick of this nation by George W. Bush and his army
of Republican Dominionist "rulers."
How Dominionism Was
Spread
The years 1982-1986 marked the period
Pat Robertson and radio and
televangelists urgently broadcast appeals that rallied christian followers
to accept a new political religion that would turn millions of christians
into an army of political operatives. It was the period when the militant
church raised itself from centuries of sleep and once again eyed power.
At the time, most Americans were completely unaware of the militant agenda
being preached on a daily basis across the breadth and width of America.
Although it was called "christianity" it can barely be recognized as christian. It in fact was and is a wolf parading in sheeps clothing: It was
and is a political scheme to take over the government of the United States
and then turn that government into an aggressor nation that will forcibly
establish the United States as the ruling empire of the twenty-first
century. It is subversive, seditious, secretive, and dangerous.[9]
Dominionism is a natural if unintended extension of Social Darwinism and is
frequently called "christian Reconstructionism." Its doctrines are shocking
to ordinary christian believers and to most Americans.
Journalist Frederick
Clarkson, who has written extensively on the subject, warned in 1994 that Dominionism,
"seeks to replace democracy with a theocratic elite
that would govern by imposing their interpretation of Biblical Law."
He described the
ulterior motive of Dominionism is to eliminate "
labor unions, civil rights
laws, and public schools." Clarkson then describes the creation of new
classes of citizens:
"Women would be generally relegated to hearth and home. Insufficiently christian
men would be denied citizenship, perhaps executed. So severe is this
theocracy that it would extend capital punishment [to] blasphemy,
heresy, adultery, and homosexuality." [10]
Today, Dominionists hide their agenda and have resorted to stealth; one
investigator who has engaged in internet exchanges with people who identify
themselves as religious conservatives said,
"They cut and run if I mention the word Dominionism."
[11]
Joan Bokaer, the Director of
Theocracy
Watch, a project of the Center for Religion, Ethics and Social Policy
at Cornell University wrote,
"In March 1986, I was on a speaking tour in
Iowa and received a copy of the following memo [Pat] Robertson had
distributed to the Iowa Republican County Caucus titled, "How to
Participate in a Political Party."
It read:
"Rule the world for God.
"Give the impression that you are there to work for the party, not push
an ideology.
"Hide your strength.
"Dont flaunt your christianity.
"christians need to take leadership positions. Party officers control
political parties and so it is very important that mature christians
have a majority of leadership positions whenever possible, God
willing."
[12]
Dominionists have gained extensive control of
the Republican Party and the apparatus of government throughout the United
States; they continue to operate secretly.
Their agenda to undermine all government social
programs that assist the poor, the sick, and the elderly is ingeniously
disguised under false labels that confuse voters. Nevertheless, as we shall
see, Dominionism maintains the necessity of laissez-faire economics,
requiring that people "look to God and not to government for help."
[13]
It is estimated that thirty-five million Americans who call themselves
christian, adhere to Dominionism in the United States, but most of these
people appear to be ignorant of the heretical nature of their beliefs and
the seditious nature of their political goals. So successfully have the
televangelists and churches inculcated the idea of the existence of an
outside "enemy," which is attacking christianity, that millions of people
have perceived themselves rightfully overthrowing an imaginary evil
anti-christian conspiratorial secular society.
When one examines the progress of its agenda, one sees that Dominionism has
met its time table: the complete takeover of the American government was
predicted to occur by 2004.[14]
Unless the American people reject the GOPs
control of the government, Americans may find themselves living in a
theocracy that has already spelled out its intentions to change every aspect
of American life including its cultural life, its Constitution and its laws.
Born in christian Reconstructionism, which was founded by the late
R. J. Rushdoony, the framers of the new cult included,
-
Rushdoony
-
his son-in-law Gary North
-
Pat Robertson
-
Herb Titus, the former Dean of
Robertsons Regent University School of Public Policy (formerly CBN
University)
-
Charles Colson, Robertsons political
strategist
-
Tim LaHaye
-
Gary Bauer
-
the late Francis Schaeffer
-
Paul Crouch, the founder of TBN, the
worlds largest television network,
...plus a virtual army of likeminded television
and radio evangelists and news talk show hosts.
Dominionism started with the Gospels and turned the concept of the invisible
and spiritual "Kingdom of God" into a literal political empire that could be
taken by force, starting with the United States of America.
Discarding the original message of Jesus
and forgetting that Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world," the
framers of Dominionism boldly presented a Gospel whose purpose was to
inspire christians to enter politics and execute world domination so that
Jesus could return to an earth prepared for his earthly rule by his
faithful "regents."
How Machiavellianism,
Communism, Secular Humanism and Neo-Conservatism
...Inspired a New Militant and Evil anti-christian religion
In the fifties and sixties, right-wing christians worried about communists
and communism taking over the world. Along with communism, another enemy to
christianity was identified by ministers.
In 1982, Francis Schaeffer, who
was then the leading evangelical theologian, called Secular Humanism the
greatest threat to christianity the world had ever seen. Soon American
fundamentalists and Pentecostals were seeing "humanists" everywhere.
Appearing on Pat Robertsons 700 Club show, Schaeffer claimed that humanism
was being forced on christians; it taught that man was the "center of all
things."
Like communism, secular humanism was based on
atheism, which was sufficient enough for Schaeffer to conclude that humanism
was an enemy to the Kingdom of God.[15]
"The enemy is this other view of reality,"
Schaeffer spoke emotionally.
Citing the Declaration of Independence as his
authorizing document, he said:
"Today we live in a humanist society. They
control the schools. They control public television. They control the
media in general. And what we have to say is we live in a humanist
society
[Because] the courts are not subject to the will of the people
through elections or re-election
all the great changes in the last
forty years have come through the courts. And what we must get in our
mind is the government as a whole, but especially the courts, has become
the vehicle to force this view on the total population, even if the
total population doesnt hold the view." [16]
Schaeffer claimed that the major "titanic
changes" to America occurred since 1942:
"If you dont revolt against tyranny and
this is what I call the bottom line, is that not only do you have the
privilege but [you have] the duty to revolt. When people force upon you
and society that which is absolutely contrary to the Word of God,
and which really is tyranny
we have a right to stand against it as a
matter of principle. And this was the basis upon which the founding
fathers built this country."
The appeal to evangelicals went further.
On
April 29, 1985, Billy Graham, the respected and world famous evangelist,
told Pat Robertsons audience on the 700 Club show that:
"[T]he time has come when evangelicals are going to have to think about
getting organized corporately
Im for evangelicals running for public
office and winning if possible and getting control of the Congress,
getting control of the bureaucracy, getting control of the executive
branch of government. I think if we leave it to the other side were
going to be lost. I would like to see every true believer involved in
politics in some way shape or form."
According to Schaeffer, Robertson, and Billy
Graham, then arguably the three most famous and influential leaders in the
American protestant church world, "Gods people" had a moral duty to change the government of the United
States.[17]
Significantly, at the time, many other fundamentalist ministers were
identifying communism and secular humanism as religions. However, the
equating of a political ideology on the one hand, and a philosophy that
rejects supernaturalism on the other hand, with religions was not
accidental.[18] It allowed the preachers to revile an economic-political
system as well as a philosophy as false religions, even demonic religions,
which christians should reject at any cost.[19]
Underneath the pejoratives, however, there was a grudging admiration on the
part of Pat Robertson and the other politically astute Dominionists, for
they saw that a political agenda that wrapped itself in religious robes had
the innate power to explode exponentially into the most politically dynamic
movement in American and world history.
The result of the new religion was that by the year 2000, thirty-five
million Americans would declare war on the remaining 245 million.
Karl Rove,
President Bushs political advisor, told the Family Research Council in
2002,
"We need to find ways to win the war." [20]
One is tempted to respond,
"Wait a minute, theyre in power so why do
they need to continue the war?"
That is the salient question. The answer is frightening.
Starting with a simple idea, Robertson perceived the enormous advantage of
placing an otherwise unacceptable political theory into a religious context.
By doing so it would stand christianity up-side-down and end American
democracy.
A Machiavellian Religion Was Born
American christianity had already seen extremes.
For Dominionists, perhaps
the single most important event in the last half of the twentieth century
occurred when the Reverend
Jim Jones proved that the religious would follow
their leader to Guyana and even further, to their deaths. That fact could
hardly have escaped the notice of even the dullest of politically minded
preachers.
Indeed, Jim Jones surreal power over his congregants leaps out from the
grave even today. If a man desired to change the laws in America - to undo
Franklin Delano Roosevelts New Deal for instance, and allow corporations
the unbridled freedom they enjoyed prior to the Great Depression (which
included the freedom to defraud, pillage, and to destroy the land with
impunity on the way to gathering great fortunes), what better way to proceed
than to cloak the corruption within a religion?
If a few men wanted to
establish an American empire and control the entire world, what better
vehicle to carry them to their goal than to place their agenda within the
context of a religion?
Jim Jones proved religious people would
support even immoral political deeds if their leaders found a way to frame
those deeds as "Gods Will." The idea was brilliant. Its framers knew they could glorify
greed, hate, nationalism and even a christian empire with ease.[21]
The religion the canny thinkers founded follows the reverse of communism and
secular humanism, it poured political and economic ideology into a religion
and that combustible mixture produced "Dominionism," a new political faith
that had the additional advantage of insulating the cult from attacks on its
political agenda by giving its practitioners the covering to simply cry out,
"Youre attacking me for my religious
beliefs and thats religious persecution!" [22]
But how could a leader get away with a religious fraud that barely hides its
destructive and false intent?
Jim Joness history holds the answer.
He not only proved the obvious fact
that
people are blinded by their religious beliefs and will only impute
goodness, mercy, and religious motivations to their leader, but Jim Jones
proved the efficacy of the basic teaching of Machiavelli:
a leader must only
appear to have the qualities of goodness - he need not actually possess those
attributes.
In fact, Machiavelli taught that it is dangerous for a leader to practice
goodness. Instead, he must pretend to be good and then do the opposite.
Machiavelli taught that a leader will succeed on appearances alone. A good
leader puts his finger to the wind and changes course whenever it is
expedient to do so.
Machiavelli wrote this revealing passage that
could be
applied not only to false religious leaders but to a false President:
"Alexander VI did nothing else but deceive
men, he thought of nothing else, and found the occasion for it; no man
was ever more able to give assurances, or affirmed things with stronger
oaths, and no man observed them less; however, he always succeeded in
his deceptions, as he well knew this aspect of things."
"Everybody sees what you appear to be, few feel what you are, and those
few will not dare to oppose themselves to the many, who have the majesty
of the state to defend them; and in the actions of men, and especially
of princes, from which there is no appeal, the end justifies the means."
(p. 93)
Chillingly Machiavelli advises his readers:
"Let a prince therefore aim at conquering
and maintaining the state, and the means will always be judged honorable
and praised by every one, for the vulgar is always taken by appearances
and the issue of the event; and the world consists only of the vulgar,
and the few who are not vulgar are isolated when the many have a
rallying point in the prince."
(p. 94)
Machiavelli also wrote how to govern dominions that previous to being
occupied lived under their own laws.
His words eerily reflect the
Bush
Administrations decisions on how to rule Iraq:
"When those states which have been acquired are accustomed to live at
liberty under their own laws, there are three ways of holding them.
-
the
first is to despoil them [23]
-
the second is to go and live there in person
-
the third is to allow them to live under their own laws, taking tribute of
them, and creating within the country a government composed of a few who
will keep it friendly to you
Because this government, being created by
the prince, knows that it cannot exist without his friendship and
protection, and will do all it can to keep them. What is more, a city
used to liberty can be more easily held by means of its citizens than in
any other way, if you wish to preserve it."
(p. 46)
However Machiavelli has second thoughts and follows with this caveat:
"
. [I]n truth there is no sure method of
holding them except by despoiling them. And whoever becomes the ruler of
a free city and does not destroy it, can expect to be destroyed by it,
for it can always find a motive for rebellion in the name of liberty and
of its ancient usages
" [24]
(p. 46)
(The above quotes are from
The Prince in the original Oxford University
Press translation by Luigi Ricci, 1903; revised by E. R. P. Vincent, 1935)
Machiavellis books, The Prince and The Discourses are not abstract
treatises.
Christian Gauss, who wrote an important introduction to the
Oxford edition, called them by their rightful name: they are in fact a
"concise manual - a handbook of those who would acquire or increase their
political power."
Gauss tells us that a long line of kings and ministers and
tyrants studied Machiavelli, including Mussolini, Hitler, Lenin and Stalin.
How can Evil Deeds be
reconciled with christian beliefs?
Its important to understand that the founders of Dominionism are sitting on
the horns of a moral dilemma: How can a leader be both good and evil at the
same time?
For if biblical moral proscriptions are applicable to him, he
will certainly suffer some form of censure. And if proscriptions are
applicable, the leader could not lie to the citizenry with impunity or do
evil so that "good" could be achieved. The answer to the dilemma of how a Dominionist leader could both do evil and still maintain his place of honor
in the christian community lies in the acceptance and adoption of the
Calvinistic doctrine that James Hogg wrote about in The Private Memoirs and
Confessions of a Justified Sinner. (W.W. Norton, N.Y. 1970.)
This novel, published in 1824, is concerned with psychological aberration
and as such, anticipates the literature of the twentieth century. The
protagonist is a young man named Robert, who drenched in the religious
bigotry of Calvinism, concluded that he was predestined before the beginning
of the world to enter heaven, therefore no sin he committed would be held to
his account.
This freed Robert to become an assassin in the cause of Christ
and His Church.
Fifty years ago a variation on the concept was expressed disapprovingly as,
"Once saved - always saved." In this view, salvation had nothing to do with
"good works or a holy life."
A drunk who had a born again experience would
be among Gods chosen elect whether he stopped drinking or not. But the
logical extension of the reasoning is the idea that christianity could have
within itself not ex-sinners but active sinners as:
...and every other kind of socio-pathological behavior possible.
As
we have sadly witnessed of late the concept is broadly accepted within the
American churches.
But the Dominionists needed the aberrant extension of Calvinism; they
believe as did Calvin and John Knox that before the creation of the
universe, all men were indeed predestined to be either among Gods elect or
were unregenerate outcasts. And it is at this point Dominionists introduced
a perversion to Calvinism - the same one James Hogg utilizes in his The
Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner - its technical
name is "supralapsarianism."
It means essentially that the man called from before
the foundation of the world to be one of the elect of Gods people, can do
no wrong. No wonder then observers noted a definite religious swing in
George W. Bush from Wesleyan theology to Calvinism early in his
administration.[25]
How comforting the Calvinistic idea of a "justified sinner" is when one is
utilizing Machiavellian techniques to gain political control of a state.
Its more than comforting; it is a required doctrine for
"christians" who
believe they must use evil to bring about good. It justifies lying, murder,
fraud and all other criminal acts without the fuss of having to deal with
guilt feelings or to feel remorse for the lives lost through executions,
military actions, or assassinations.
If this doctrine seems too wayward to believe as it might have done had I
not heard a recent interview with a Pentecostal minister - rest assured the
twisted doctrine is horribly alive and thriving in America today.
The interview conducted by Brian Copeland a news talk show host for KGO, San
Francisco on September 5, 2003, was with the Reverend Donald Spitz of
Pensacola, Florida who is involved with a Pro Life group in Virginia and
with the Army of God. The occasion was the execution of Paul Hill, another
Pentecostal minister who murdered a doctor and his body guard outside an
abortion clinic.
Hill was caught and convicted of the crimes. Spitz admitted
that he was Paul Hills spiritual counselor. He said Hill died with the
conviction he had done the lords work.
Spitz who approved of the murder
said,
"Someone else is going to handle the
publishing of Paul Hills book On How to Assassinate."
Spitz believed that Hill was completely justified in murdering the physician
because, according to him,
"twenty-six babies lives were saved by the
killing."
When Copeland pointed out that the scheduled abortions for the
morning of the murders would have simply been postponed to another day - and
that the lives of the fetuses were only extended for a day or so, Spitz
refused to accept the argument.
Not surprisingly, Spitz opposed the use of birth control methods.
Copeland
asked,
"If a woman is raped should she be forced to carry the fetus to
term?" Spitz said, "Yes."
"What if the pregnancy will kill the mother?" Spitz replied that under no
circumstances could "the baby be killed."
When Spitz was asked,
"Why havent you gone out and killed an
abortionist?" he replied calmly, "God hasnt told me to do the
killing."
The Neo-Conservative Connection with Dominionists and Machiavelli
I suspect that most Americans have never heard of Machiavelli, nevertheless,
it should be no surprise to us that Machiavelli has been accepted, praised,
and followed by the Neo-Conservatives in the White House and his precepts
are blindly adopted by the so-called "christian" Dominionists.
Kevin
Phillips tells us in his masterful book, American Dynasty that Karl Rove,
political strategist for President George W. Bush, is a devotee of
Machiavelli, just as Roves predecessor, Lee Atwater had been for the elder
Bush.[26]
In fact, there has been an incredible effort to dilute the immoral
implications of Machiavellis teachings.
Todays best apologist for
Machiavelli is one of the most influential voices in Washington with direct
connections into the oval office.
Michael A. Ledeen was a Senior Fellow with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies and a counselor to the National Security Council and
special counselor to former Secretary of State, Alexander Haig in 1985. His
relationship with Pat Robertson goes back at least to the early 1980s.[27]
Like Robertson, Ledeen was an advocate for military intervention in
Nicaragua and for assistance to the Contras. (Ledeen was also involved in
the Iran-Contra affair.) [28]
Today, in 2004, Michael Ledeen is a fellow at the conservative think tank,
the American Enterprise Institute and according to William O. Beeman of the
Pacific News Service,
"Ledeen has become the driving philosophical
force behind the neoconservative movement and the military actions it
has spawned." [29]
Ledeen made a number of appearances on the 700 Club show during the 1980s.
Always presented as a distinguished guest, Robertson interviewed him on
April 30, 1985 and asked him on this occasion:
"What would you recommend if you were going
to advise the President [Ronald Reagan] as to foreign policy?"
Ledeen responded:
"The United States has to make clear to the
world and above all to its own citizens, what our vital interests are.
And then we must make it clear to everyone that we are prepared to fight
and fight fiercely to defend those interests, so that people will not
cross the lines that are likely to kick off a trip wire."
If Ledeens advice sounds ruthless and Machiavellian
- it may be because it is
Machiavellian.
(By definition his statement presupposes the existence of
something or several things that are life threatening to the nation by the
use of the word "vital." Yet Ledeen asserts that which is life threatening
must be made manifest or defined. If an interest must be defined, then it is
not apparent; yet the nation will nevertheless ask its sons and daughters to
fight and die for something that is not apparent. Therefore, whatever "interests" Ledeen wanted to be defined, cannot have been vital interests,
which are apparent - so in reality he advised the President to call
discretionary interests vital - which is a lie.)
Be aware that Ledeen is in complete accord with Machiavellian thinking. And
so is Pat Robertson.[30]
Robertson agreed to virtually every nuance Ledeen
presented. In fact, its not clear which of the two first proposed invading
Syria, Iran and Iraq back in the 1980s,[31] a refrain that also echoed in
the reports of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), one of the
major homes for neo-conservatives in 2000.
Both Ledeen and Robertson
targeted the same nations that
PNAC lists as Americas greatest enemies in
its paper, "Rebuilding America's Defenses" (published in September
2000.)[32]
In 1999, Ledeen published his book,
Machiavelli on Modern Leadership: Why
Machiavellis Iron Rules Are as Timely and Important Today as Five Centuries
Ago.
Here is a
sample of how Ledeen smoothes rough edges and presents a modern Machiavelli:
"In order to achieve the most noble
accomplishments, the leader may have to enter into evil. This is the
chilling insight that has made Machiavelli so feared, admired, and
challenging. It is why we are drawn to him still
"
(p.
91)
Again, Ledeen writes:
"Just as the quest for peace at any price
invites war and, worse than war, defeat and domination, so good acts
sometimes advance the triumph of evil, as there are circumstances when
only doing evil ensures the victory of a good cause."
(p. 93)
Ledeen clearly believes "the end justifies the means," but not all the time.
He writes "Lying is evil," but then contradictorily argues that it produced,
"a magnificent result," and "is essential to
the survival of nations and to the success of great enterprises."
(p. 95)
Ledeen adds this tidbit:
"Alls fair in war... and in love.
Practicing deceit to fulfill your hearts desire might be not only
legitimate, but delicious!"
(p. 95)
William O. Beeman tells us about Michael Ledeens influence.
Writing for the
Pacific News Service he says:
"Ledeens ideas are repeated daily by such
figures as Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz
He
basically believes that violence in the service of the spread of
democracy is Americas manifest destiny. Consequently, he has become the
philosophical legitimator of the American occupation of Iraq." [33]
In fact, Ledeens influence goes even further.
The BBC, the Washington Post
and Jim Lobe writing for the Asia Times report that Michael Ledeen is the
only full-time international affairs analyst consulted by Karl Rove.[34] Ledeen has regular conversations with Rove.
The Washington Post said,
"More than once, Ledeen has seen his ideas
faxed to Rove, become official policy or rhetoric." [35]
Leo Strauss the Father of Neo-Conservatism
Leo Strauss was born in 1899 and died in 1973.
He was a Jewish scholar who
fled Germany when Hitler gained power. He eventually found refuge in the
United States where he taught political science at the University of
Chicago. He is most famous for resuscitating Machiavelli and introducing his
principles as the guiding philosophy of the neo-conservative movement.
Strauss has been called the godfather of Newt Gingrichs "Contract with
America."
More than any other man, Strauss breathed upon conservatism,
inspiring it to rise from its atrophied condition and its natural dislike of
change and to embrace an unbounded new political ideology that rides on the
back of a revolutionary steed, hailing even radical change; hence the name
Neo-Conservatives.
The father of neo-conservatism had many "spiritual" children at the
University of Chicago, among them: Paul Wolfowitz and Abram Shulsky, who
received their doctorates under Strauss in 1972.
Harry V. Jaffa was a
student of Strauss and has an important connection to Dominionists like Pat
Robertson as we shall see below. However, Strausss family of influence
extended beyond his students to include faculty members in universities, and
the people his students taught.
Those prominent neo-conservatives who are
most notable are:
...and scores of others, many of whom hold important
positions in George W. Bushs White House and Defense Department.
To understand the Straussian infusion of power that transformed an all but
dead conservative realm, think of Nietzsches Overman come to life. Or
better yet, think of the philosophy most unlike christianity: Think of pure
unmitigated evil.
Strauss admits that Machiavelli is an evil man. But
according to Strauss, his admission is a prerequisite to studying and
reading Machiavelli: the acknowledgement is the safety net that keeps the
reader from being corrupted. One is tempted to talk back to Strauss and
point out an alternative: the admission could be the subterfuge that keeps a
man from being ridiculed and rejected for espousing Machiavellian methods.
In one of the most important books for our times, Shadia Drurys
Leo Strauss
and the American Right, undertakes to explain the ideas behind Strausss
huge influence and following.
Strausss reputation, according to Drury,
rests in large part on his view that,
"a real philosopher must communicate
quietly, subtly, and secretly to the few who are fit to receive his
message."
Strauss claims secrecy is necessary to avoid
"persecution."
[36]
In reading Strauss, one sometimes encounters coded contradictory ideas. For
example, Strauss appears to respect Machiavelli because - as he points out - in
contrast to other evil men, Machiavelli openly proclaimed opinions that
others only secretly expressed behind closed doors.
But we have just noted
that Strauss teaches that secrecy is essential to the real philosopher.
Strauss concluded, some would say that Machiavelli was after all, a patriot
of sorts for he loved Italy more than he loved his own soul. Then Strauss
warns, but if you call him a patriot, you "merely obscure something truly
evil." [37]
So Strauss dances his way through the Machiavellian field of
evil, his steps choreographed with duplicity and its opposite. The reader
cannot let go.
In Strausss view, Machiavelli sees that christianity "has led the world
into weakness," which can only be offset by returning the world to the
ancient practices of the past. (Implied is not a return to the pagan past,
but rather a return to the more virulent world of the Old Testament).
Strauss laments,
"Machiavelli needed
a detailed discussion
revealing the harmony between his political teaching and the teaching of
the Bible."
[38]
These statements of Strauss, by themselves, were sufficient to send
neo-conservative christians to search for correlations between
Machiavellianism, radical conservatism and the scriptures.[39]
Strausss teaching incorporated much of Machiavellis. Significantly, his
philosophy is unfriendly to democracy - even antagonistic. At the same time
Strauss upheld the necessity for a national religion not because he favored
religious practices, but because religion in his view is necessary in order
to control the population.
Since neo-conservatives influenced by Strauss are
in control of the Bush administration, I have prepared a brief list that
shows the radical unchristian basis of neo-conservatism.
I am indebted to Shadia Drurys book (Leo Strauss and the American Right)
and published
interviews for the following:
-
First: Strauss believed that a leader had to perpetually deceive the
citizens he ruled.
-
Secondly: Those who lead must understand there is no morality, there is only
the right of the superior to rule the inferior.
-
Thirdly: According to Drury, Religion "is the glue that holds society
together."[40] It is a handle by which the ruler can manipulate the masses.
Any religion will do. Strauss is indifferent to them all.
-
Fourthly: "Secular society
is the worst possible thing," because it leads to
individualism, liberalism, and relativism, all of which encourage dissent
and rebellion. As Drury sums it up: "You want a crowd that you can
manipulate like putty."[41]
-
Fifthly: "Strauss thinks that a political order can be stable only if it is
united by an external threat; and following Machiavelli, he maintains that
if no external threat exists, then one has to be manufactured."[42]
-
Sixthly: "In Strausss view, the trouble
with liberal society is that it dispenses with noble lies and pious
frauds. It tries to found society on secular rational foundations."
Strausss Student, Harry Jaffa on the 700 Club with Pat Robertson
For four days in 1986, from July first through the fourth of July, Pat
Robertson interviewed neo-conservative Dr. Harry Jaffa, a former student of
Leo Strauss, on the 700 Club show.
The topic was the importance of the
Declaration of Independence.
Joining with Jaffa was Robertsons own man,
Herb Titus, the Dean of CBNs School of Public Policy. This series of
interviews was one of the most important philosophical moments in the
development of the political agenda and political philosophy of the
Dominionists.
Robertson found in Harry Jaffa, the champion he needed, whose reasoning
would influence how the Constitution should be interpreted by conservatives
and would provide a "christian" view of the establishment of the United
States that excluded the secular social contract view. Harry Jaffa would
influence both Clarence Thomas (who would be appointed to the Supreme Court
by President George Bush senior in 1991) and Antonin Scalia (who would be
appointed to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan on September 26,
1986).
During the four days of interviews Jaffa and Titus agreed that the
Declaration of Independence was the premier document and it superceded the
Constitution.
Titus said,
"The Declaration
is the charter of the
nation. It is what you might call the articles of incorporation, whereas
the Constitution is the bylaws. The Constitution is the means by which
to carry out the great purposes that are articulated in the
Declaration."
Robertson asked:
"Lets assume that eighty percent of the
people are just totally immoral, they want to live lives of gross
licentiousness and they want to prey on one another, thats what they
want and they want a government to let them do it. How does that square
with the Declaration of Independence and its consent of the governed?"
Titus said,
"Even the people cant consent to give away that which
God says is unalienable."
Robertson then asked,
"The principles enunciated in the
Declaration of Independence, how far have we gone from it and what can
we do to redress some of these problems?"
Jaffa responded cryptically:
"Id say that today, for example in the
Attorney Generals [Edwin Meeses] warfare with the liberals on the
Supreme Court, in his appeal to original intent, he appeals to the text
of the Constitution. Jefferson and Madison said together in 1825, If
you want to find the principles of the Constitution of the United
States, you go first to the Declaration of Independence."
First, Jaffa means by the term "original intent" that the Constitution must
be interpreted according to what it meant when it was originally adopted. It
is a revolutionary and brilliant idea that will allow the Dominionists to
effectively repeal most of the judicial decisions made in the last century.
[43]
Secondly, if we take Jaffa and the Dominionists at their word and go to the
Declaration of Independence, we can see just how radical the conservative
revolution and Dominionism are.
The only portion that is ever quoted
publicly are these words:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and
the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are
instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed,"
The quote stops in the middle of the sentence - the part that is never quoted
is this:
"That whenever any Form of Government
becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to
alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its
foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as
to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."
Dominionism then, takes its authority to overthrow the government of the
United States from our own Declaration of Independence.
By the time all
Americans wake up to the Dominionists intent, it may be too late.
Though Harry Jaffa speaks with a high minded sense of political
righteousness, Shadia Drury exposes his Machiavellian side.
Like Strauss, he,
"clearly believes that devious and illegal
methods are justified when those in power are convinced of the rightness
of their ends." [44]
Jaffa and
Robertson saw eye to eye on more than one topic: for instance, Jaffa like
his host Pat Robertson, found Oliver North to be a hero (and by extension
Michael Ledeen) when both North and Ledeen went around the law to provide
military aid to the contras.[45]
How Dominionism Stealthily Swept Over America
Within a period of twenty to thirty years beginning in the 1970s,
Dominionism spread like wild fire throughout the evangelical, Pentecostal
and fundamentalist religious communities in America.
It was aided and
abetted by television and radio evangelists. More than any other man, Pat
Robertson mobilized the millions of politically indifferent and socially
despised Pentecostals and fundamentalists in America and turned them into an
angry potent army of political conquerors.[46]
But it would be a mistake to limit Dominionism to the Pentecostals and
fundamentalists alone: conservative Roman Catholics and Episcopalians have
joined and enlarged the swelling numbers.[47]
Robertson, like other media
preachers, used every form of communication: television, radio, books and
audio tapes available for sale. One book stands out.
Originally published in
1982 and written with Bob Slosser, a key Robertson loyalist, Pat Robertsons
The Secret Kingdom soared on the bestseller charts. It underwent four
printings during its first year. By 1984 Bantam published a mass paperback
in cooperation with Thomas Nelson, the original publisher. (Though the book
has since been revised, my quotes are from the original version.)
However, it was the Pentecostals and fundamentalists who made up the core of
Robertsons audience.
To a people who were largely uneducated and who often
remained ignorant even if they went through college because of their fear of
becoming tainted by the "world and worldliness," Dominionism came as a
brilliant light that assuaged their deep sense of inferiority. Pentecostals
in particular could take comfort from the notion that no longer would the
world think of them as "Holy Rollers" who danced in the "Spirit" and
practiced
glossolalia.
This time, they would be on top - they would be the
head and not the tail - and the so-called elite, the educated of the world,
would be on the bottom.
A new world was coming. To help the transition along, Pat Robertson, along
with other pastors, evangelists and churchmen, founded schools, universities
and colleges throughout the United States to train "christians" how to run
for office, how to win, and how to manage the affairs of government after
they gained office. To get an idea of how successful the plan was,
Robertsons Regent University now has a $100 million endowment.
After
watching the Dominionists takeover the Republican Party and observing their
ruthless methods, it is indeed apparent that Machiavellian principles are
the fuel running their "How to Manual."
Starting with a class of only twelve in 1985, Robertson began his Journalism
Department at CBN University where 800 other graduate students were earning
Master degrees in a fully accredited institution.
Later Robertson changed
the name of CBN University to "Regent University" - based on Dominionisms
teaching that the national government of America and governments of the
world will be ruled by Dominionists, who will act as regents on an interim
basis, that is, until the true King - Jesus Christ - will return to earth again
and gratefully accept His Kingdom from the hands of His faithful regents.
The Dominionist Plan: Today Control the USA, Tomorrow the World
Significantly, Dominionism is a form of Social Darwinism.[48]
It inherently
includes the religious belief that wealth-power is a sign of Gods election.
That is, out of the masses of people and the multitude of nations - wealth, in
and of itself, is thought to indicate Gods approval on men and nations
whereas poverty and sickness reflect Gods disapproval. The roots of the
idea come from a natural twist of an Old Testament passage, which I discuss
below.
Essentially there were two elements necessary to establish Dominionism among
christians who previously believed helping the poor was a
mandate of christianity.[49]
First, Old Testament law had to be accepted as an essential part of a
christians theology.
Secondly, the christian had to undergo a second conversion-like experience
that went beyond being born again and demanded not only a commitment to
reestablishing the Old Testament legal structure but required the
implementation of that law in the nations of the world (including the U.S.)
based upon a different understanding of the Great Commission (Matthew 28:
18-20).[50]
Under this concept Dominionists are to go into all the world to
take dominion and "make disciples" teaching the disciples to "observe all"
that Jesus "commanded." All nations under Dominionists teaching are to
convert to biblical laws, which are ranked superior to secular laws that
were not God given or God directed and are found wanting.
The christian
therefore must be willing to overthrow all laws that are secular.
In other words, a measure of ones spirituality rested upon the individuals
willingness to accept the concept of taking dominion over not only the
people of America, but taking dominion over the people of the entire world.
From Dominionists actual words, the taking of America is perceived as a
violent act.
Ben Kinchlow who co-hosted CBNs 700 Club with Pat Robertson
told an audience,
"We need to grab the American dream by the
short hairs and snatch it back to where it was originally designed to
be."
As Robertson wrote approvingly in his book, The Secret Kingdom, the kingdom
of heaven "suffers violence, and violent men take it by force."
He
explained,
"Zealous men force their way in. Thats what it means."
(Page
82.)
What "Dominion" Means
There were an estimated 110,000 Pentecostal and fundamentalist churches in
America in the 1980s.
Robertson taught them - through his vast television
network and through his books - that the role of the christian is to rule over
the wicked. Dominionisms purpose is to create theocrats (a christian class
of rulers).
But in order to successfully place only certain
christians in
positions of power, Dominionism divides christian believers into classes
based upon political ideology and certain hot point issues such as the
privatization of Social Security and Medicare, freedom to decide on medical
procedures with ones own physician, freedom of the press and freedom of
speech, freedom of the arts, and certain rights like the right to a fair
trial and protection from governmental intrusion into the privacy of
marriage and adult associations.
The believers who are destined to rule are called the "elect," and are
separated from those believers who do not and will not accept the
predestined superiority of the chosen ruling class. A christian who raises
his voice against the "elect" could be labeled a "false prophet or a dreamer
of dreams," and therefore, according to the Deuteronomic law "shall be put
to death."
Placing his own words in the mouth of God, Robertson wrote in The Secret
Kingdom:
"It is clear that God is saying, I
gave man dominion over the earth, but he lost it. Now I desire mature
sons and daughters who will in My name exercise dominion over the earth
and will subdue Satan, the unruly, and the rebellious. Take back My
world from those who would loot it and abuse it. Rule as I would rule."
(p. 201.)
On his 700 Club television show (5-1-86) Robertson said:
"Gods plan is for His people, ladies
and gentleman to take dominion
What is dominion? Well, dominion is
Lordship. He wants His people to reign and rule with Him
but Hes
waiting for us to
extend His dominion
And the lord says, Im going to
let you redeem society. Therell be a reformation
We are not going to
stand for those coercive utopians in the Supreme Court and in Washington
ruling over us any more. Were not going to stand for it. We are going
to say, we want freedom in this country, and we want power
"
Charles Colson, the former Special Counsel to Richard Nixon, who was called
"Nixons Hatchet Man," pled guilty to charges in the Daniel Ellsberg case
during the Watergate Scandal.
He served a prison sentence, and started a
prison ministry afterward. Pat Robertson has called him "the most brilliant
political strategist in the world." Over the years, Colson made many
appearances on the 700 Club.
On one occasion, he laid out the battle lines:
"It always has been a conflict between the kingdoms: the kingdom of
God and
the kingdom of man. When you really look at what Jesus is saying, He is
saying the time is fulfilled, repent and believe, the kingdom is at hand.
And He is calling for the kingdom of God to rule over the affairs of
man. And so inevitably theres going to be a conflict."
(The 700 Club 5-21-86)
Robertson said on his program the 700 Club (5-13-86):
"Weve sat idly by long enough and said,
Well religion and politics dont mix. Dont you believe it. If we
dont have moral people in government then the only other people that
can be in government are immoral. Thats the only way it goes. Either
you have moral people in there or you have immoral people."
On another show (5-7-86) he revealed a partial list of changes the
Dominionists planned for America:
"We can change the government, we can change
the court systems, we can change the poverty problem, we can change
education
We can make a difference."
Who Rules? And Who Are to Be the Ruled?
In an earlier section, I discussed the principle held by both Machiavelli
and Leo Strauss that religion is necessary as a tool for a leader to control
the masses.
If conformity - not dissent is required, then religion is the
power tool of choice, for it will insure a controlled populace. Were about
to examine its uses, its ingenious gifts and its powers, in this and the
following sections. Be aware that Dominionism is in fact, a brilliantly
executed road that leads to total power.
In his book, which tended to be more formal and less expansive, Pat
Robertson began the listing of those Americans not fit for public office:
"Obviously the drunk, the drug addict, the
lustful, the slothful do not have the discipline to rule the earth and
to correct its evils."
(p. 82)
"If we remain unrighteous, the Bible
says, we will miss the kingdom."
(p.83)
Then he quoted Pauls epistle to the Corinthians:
"Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor
drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God."
(1
Corinthians 6:9-10) (p. 83)
If "Secular Humanists are the greatest threat to
christianity the world has
ever known," as theologian Francis Schaeffer claimed, then who are the
Humanists?
According to Dominionists, humanists are the folks who allow or
encourage licentious behavior in America.
They are the undisciplined
revelers.
Put all the enemies of the Dominionists together, boil them down to liquid
and bake them into the one single most highly derided and contaminated
individual known to man, and you will have before you an image of the
quintessential "liberal" - one of those folks who wants to give liberally to
the poor and needy - who desires the welfare and happiness of all
Americans - who insists on safety regulations for your protection and who
desires the preservation of your values - those damnable people are the folks
that must be reduced to powerlessness - or worse: extinction.
Dominionists determine who is among Gods elect - not solely by a religious
experience such as being born again, but by a political determination of
whether one is a Republican or a Democrat, a liberal or a conservative or
simply a person who questions the deeds of Dominionist political figures.
The politics of exclusion, including bigotry, is in fact wide spread
throughout the United States.
Take, for instance, Sean Hannitys remarks to Time Magazine,
"You can play golf with liberals, be
neighbors with them, go out to dinner. I just dont want them in power." [51]
Or take Ann Coulters assertions:
"Liberals have a preternatural gift for
striking a position on the side of treason."
Or,
"Whenever the nation is under attack, from within or without, liberals side
with the enemy." (It turns out that every single "liberal" in the country is
a member of the Democratic Party and therefore is a traitor.) [52]
The Machiavellian nature of the Dominionist cult explains why Bill Clinton
who is a christian believer was attacked so viciously for his sexual folly
but Newt Gingrich, Bill Livingston, Henry Hyde, Strom Thurmond and scores of
other Republicans escaped the punishment of public ridicule, verbal abuse,
and humiliation for the same sexual peccadilloes.
(It appears only
Democratic "liberals" must be held to the fire of biblical standards and
biblical punishments because as we all know, they are "unregenerate from the
beginning of time.")
Robertsons book acknowledges that his followers, the "christian" army
raised up for political purposes are the elect chosen to rule.
Robertsons
transcribed television interviews and dialogs give shocking evidence to the
legitimization of greed, hatred, violence and cruelty by members of the
various fundamentalist branches of the American clergy and by elected
officials of the Republican Party, which can be cited as evidence that Dominionism is not a
christian religion - that above everything else, Dominionism is synonymous with Machiavellianism: the ends justify the means.
Under Dominionism, true christianity is a target to destroy, not a goal to
achieve.
Who Lives and Who Dies? How Justice Scalia Would Expand the Death Penalty
In one of those peculiar moments when a host on television seems to have a
disconnect with his guest, I realized that Pat Robertson was using "code"
with Herb Titus, his "guest" on the show on May 27, 1985.
Titus was the Dean
of CBN Universitys School of Public Policy and was a known christian Reconstructionist (Dominionist) who had written position papers arguing that
government has exceeded its authority by requiring individuals such as
doctors, lawyers, and teachers to be licensed by the state.
Robertson,
himself, revealed what the School of Public Policy was teaching on a later
show (July 5, 1985).
"What are we going to teach them? Well
teach them the foundation of our government. Were going to teach them
how to win elections."
This exchange with Titus occurred on May 27, 1985:
Robertson: "We have with us today Constitutional authority, Herb Titus. Herb... How about the biblical concept of war? You know there are many
people who dont think we should ever fight wars and yet were talking about
brave men who died for freedom."
Titus: "Well I believe the
scripture is very clear that if you are attacked by evil whether within
the country or outside the country, that its the duty of the civil
authorities to defend the nation and the people of the nation from evil
whether it comes from an aggressor outside or an aggressor inside. We
can see that in Romans 13 for example."
Curious about the meaning of what was being said, particularly since
Robertson had asked a question about war, and Titus answer included war
against ones own population, I looked up Romans 13.
I had always read this
passage to be St. Pauls concept of a good government providing beneficial
services to the governed and I restricted its meaning to only a lawfully
constituted government that rules justly.
But read Romans 13 in the light of Machiavellis and Leo Strausss
discourses on religion and its uses by a political leader, and one glimpses
the danger that Dominionism represents to the American people and to the
American way of life.
For it can be read to mean that any lawful government
is ordained by God to execute retribution and punishment upon those who
challenge (resist or rebel against) unjust policies of a government. When
read this way, it takes on a new and sinister meaning. Or, it can be read to
mean that once a new government of the United States of America has been
established under biblical law - then no citizen will have the right to resist
it or rebel against its edicts.
In other words, the Declaration of
Independence will no longer be applicable to the regency established by the Dominionists.
This is how Romans 13 reads in the New English Version:
"Every person must submit to the supreme authorities. There is no authority
but by act of God, and the existing authorities are instituted by him;
consequently anyone who rebels against authority is resisting a divine
institution, and those who so resist have themselves to thank for the
punishment they will receive. For government, a terror to crime, has no
terrors for good behavior.
You wish to have no fear of the authorities?
Then continue to do right and you will have their approval, for they are
Gods agents working for your good. But if you are doing wrong, then you
will have cause to fear them; it is not for nothing that they hold the power
of the sword, for they are Gods agents of punishment, for retribution on
the offender. That is why you are obliged to submit. It is an obligation
imposed not merely by fear of retribution but by conscience. That is also
why you pay taxes.
The authorities are in Gods service
and to these duties they devote their energies."
This section, if taken literally as fundamentalists are apt to do, appears
to prohibit any kind of resistance against the policies of a government,
including peaceful protests, petitions, and writings.
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia appears to endorse that position, for he quoted this same
Romans 13 passage in his article,
"Gods Justice and Ours," to prove that
christian doctrine states "government - however you want to limit that
concept - derives its moral authority from God." [53]
Government is not only
the "minister of God" but it has the authority to "execute Gods
wrath."
The power of the sword is surely the power to kill or maim and certainly the
power to intimidate. Scalia believes the power of the sword in this passage
is "unmistakably a reference to the death penalty."
At this point, Scalia demonstrates the absolute brilliance of the judicial
rule created by neo-conservatives that requires a judge to determine the
"original intent" of the writers of the Constitution.
As Scalia himself
describes it,
"The Constitution that I interpret and apply
is not living but dead
It means today not what current society
thinks it
ought to mean, but what it meant when it was adopted." [54]
Once the original thinking is
determined, the judge can enforce the Constitution only as a document that
is bound by the time zone in which a particular passage was written.
When I first read articles by authors who were exposing the Dominionists
intention to extend the death penalty to cover "crimes" like adultery,
rebelliousness, homosexuality, witchcraft or effeminateness, I found the
death penalty extension goal to be laughable. It couldnt be done in
America.
I was wrong. I now realize that we are very close to seeing the Dominionists
achieve their goal. All they need to do is to appoint a majority of judges
who will adhere to the "dead Constitution" construction rule of Scalia (or
what Harry Jaffa called "the original intent" construction rule).
At the
point when the Dominionists control the judiciary - that judiciary can roll
back Americas body of legal jurisprudence to a century or more ago as Law
Professor Patricia J. Williams pointed out.[55]
Scalia spilled the beans in his article, "Gods Justice and Ours" when he
explained how he would determine whether the death penalty is constitutional
or not. His reasoning goes like this: since the death penalty was "clearly
permitted when the Eighth Amendment [which prohibits cruel and unusual
punishments] was adopted," and at that time the death penalty was applied
for all felonies - including, for example, the felony of horse-thieving, "so
it is clearly permitted today."[56]
Justice Scalia left no doubt that if the
crime of horse stealing carried a death penalty today in the United
States - he would find that law constitutional.
All a willing Dominionist Republican controlled congress need do to extend
the death penalty to those people who practice witchcraft, adultery,
homosexuality, heresy, etcetera, is to find those particular death penalty
laws existing as of November 3, 1791, and re-instate them. No revolution is
required. Thats why the battle over Bushs judicial appointments is so
crucial to the future of the America we know and love.
And thats why the
clock is running out on freedom loving Americans.
Scalia himself appears to be a Dominionist, for he believes that Romans 13
represents the correct view - that government authority is derived from God
and not from the people; he asserts his view was the consensus of Western
thought until recent times.
Like Pat Robertson, he laments that the biblical
perspective was upset by "the emergence of democracy." [57]
Taking his cue
from Leo Strauss, Scalia argued,
"a democratic government, being nothing
more than the composite will of its individual citizens, has no more moral
power or authority than they do as individuals."
Democracy, according to
Scalia, creates problems,
"It fosters civil disobedience." [58]
As Patricia Williams wrote:
"God bless America. The Constitution
is dead." [59]
Dominionisms Theocratic Views
What would a "reconstructed" America look like under the Dominionists?
K.L.
Gentry, a Dominionist himself, suggests the following "elements of a
theonomic approach to civic order," which I strongly suggest should be
compared to the Texas GOP platform of 2002, which reveals that we are not
just talking about imaginary ideas but some things are already proposed on
Republican agendas.[60]
Dominionisms concept of government according to
Gentry is as follows:
-
It obligates government to maintain just monetary policies... [thus
prohibiting] fiat money, fractional reserve banking, and deficit spending.
-
It provides a moral basis for elective government officials...
-
It forbids undue, abusive taxation of the rich...
-
It calls for the abolishing of the prison system and establishing a
system of just restitution...
-
A theonomic approach also forbids the release, pardoning, and paroling
of murderers by requiring their execution...
-
It forbids industrial pollution that destroys the value of property...
-
It punishes malicious, frivolous malpractice suits...
-
It forbids abortion rights... Abortion
is not only a sin, but a crime, and, indeed, a capital crime. [61]
The fourth item in Gentrys list, "abolishing of the prison system and
establishing a system of just restitution" has been worked on extensively by
Dominionist Gary North, who holds a doctorate degree in Economics.
North has
written volumes of books, essays and articles, (many of which falsely
predicted that the year 2000 computer problem would bring down modern
civilization.) He is most famous among Dominionists for reconciling economic
theory with Old Testament passages.
Gary North describes the just restitution system of the bible, which
happens to reinstitute slavery, like this:
"At the other end of the curve, the poor man
who steals is eventually caught and sold into bondage under a successful
person. His victim receives payment; he receives training; his buyer
receives a stream of labor services. If the servant is successful and
buys his way out of bondage, he re-enters society as a disciplined man,
and presumably a self-disciplined man. He begins to accumulate wealth." [62]
The Immorality of the Medicare and Medicaid Programs
If the blithe acceptance of slavery isnt shocking enough, here is one of
the coldest attitudes I ever heard expressed in an interview on American
television.
I cant help reading it in light of the coercive bullying
tactics resorted to by Dominionist leaders in the House of Representatives
to get the necessary votes to pass the controversial new Medicare
Prescription Drug law.[63]
The following interview reveals the deep seated
hatred Dominionists have against governmental medical assistance to the
elderly. The interview was conducted on August 1, 1985 with Dr. Walter
Williams, professor of economics at George Mason University and author of
thirty-five books.
Danuta Soderman was a co-host on Pat Robertsons 700
Club.
She began the interview with a question about Medicare and Medicaid
fraud, suggesting cost possibly "millions and billions" of dollars:
Williams: "Well, I think that the abuse and fraud in and of itself is a
relatively minor problem. That is, the bigger problem is the whole concept
of funding somebodys medical care by a third party. And I might also
mention here, that is, I saw in the audience many older and senior citizens.
Now whose responsibility is it to take care of those people?
I think it lies
with their children and it also lies with themselves. That is, I think
christians should recognize that charity is good. I mean charity, when you
reach into your pocket to help your fellow man for medical care or for food
or to give them housing. But what the government is doing in order to help
these older citizens is not charity at all. It is theft. That is, the
government is using power to confiscate property that belongs to one
American and give, or confiscate their money, and provide services for
another set of Americans to whom it does not belong.
That is the moral
question that christians should face with not only Medicare, Medicaid. But
many other programs as well
.Well, people should have insurance. But I
would say if our fellow man is found in need, does not have enough, well
thats a role for the church, thats a role for the family, thats a
role for private institutions to take care of these things."
Danuta Soderman:
"I thought it was interesting you talked about Medicare and Medicaid as
not being a moral issue. A lot of people would think that to want to
eliminate the program is rather uncompassionate - that there is
something immoral about taking away something that people are relying so
heavily upon, but you said that there is no moral issue here."
Williams:
"I think the moral issue runs the other way. That is, we have to
ask ourselves, What is the moral basis of confiscating the property of one
American and giving it to another American to whom it does not belong for
whatever reason?
That is, I think we Americans have to ask
ourselves is there something that can justify a legalized theft? And I
think that even if the person is starving in the street that act, in and
of itself, doesnt justify my taking money from somebody else."
How to Destroy the Social Security Program
On August 14, 1985, Pat Robertson unveiled his ingenious program on how to
get rid of Social Security. The plan amazingly resembles sections of the
Bush Administrations Medicare Prescription Drug bill passed in December of
2003.
Robertson, however, outlined what to do twenty years ago as follows:
-
"We should say to all the elderly,
Youre going to be taken care of. The governments going to pay
you. Dont worry about it. [Youll] get your Social Security like
youre expecting, cause youre counting on it."
-
"There should be a gradual moving [up]
of [the retirement] age to reflect the fact that were healthier and
we live longer and people should have dignity and be allowed to work
a little bit longer."
-
"The last thing we should do is to begin
to let the younger workers slowly but surely go into private
programs where the money is tax sheltered and over the years build
up their own money and that would in turn, through the intermediary
organizations, banks, insurance companies, would invest in American
industry. They would buy plants and equipment, put people to work
and it would help a tremendous boom. Imagine
$100 billion dollars a
year flowing into American industry. It would be marvelous."
Wealth is a Sign of Gods Favor, Poverty is a Sign of Gods Disfavor
How did the Dominionists get so far from the lords edict to help the poor,
the sick, and the elderly?
Using the text of Deuteronomy 28, which is a list
of Gods blessings and curses, Robertson and other Dominionists believe that
the chapter reveals Gods covenanted economic law. God only bestows
"material wealth or blessings" upon those who are among his elect and he
does so because these are the individuals and nations who obey his
commandments and laws.
So what about the poor?
Dominionist Gary North
explains it this way:
"God is sovereign over the poor. He
raises them up - not all of them, but some of them. The lord maketh
poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up." [64]
I grant that the verse cited leaves government assistance out of the
picture. North claims, the blessings and sanctions of Deuteronomy 28 are
historical.
He says,
"They are predictable. Covenantal rebellion by a
society will lead to Gods imposition of these sanctions." [65]
North then
ties the package up neatly:
"The blessings and cursings of God under the
Mosaic Covenant were sure. They were not disconnected from Gods law.
There was a bedrock objectivity that united covenant-keepers and
covenant-breakers." [66]
To understand what North is talking about, we have to read a portion of the
text of Deuteronomy 28:
"The lord shall establish thee an holy
people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee
and the lord shall make
thee the head and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou
shalt not be beneath
"
A conclusion drawn by the scripture itself is that a nation who follows the
commandments or laws of God will be,
"high above all nations of the earth
and all
people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the
lord, and they shall be afraid of thee."
On the other hand, the Dominionists
believe those who are poor, sick, and weak are so situated because Gods
wrath has been visited upon them - they are the "wicked" of this earth and
they deserve the wrath of God because their behavior is bringing the entire
nation under condemnation.
The litany of the curses of God on those who do not keep his laws and
commandments are among the most horrendous descriptions of torture in
literature. Here is a sample from Deuteronomy 28:
"The lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies
thy carcass
shall be food unto all fowls of the air
The lord will smite thee with
[boils]
and with
tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou
canst not be healed.
The lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness
and astonishment of heart [fear]; thou shalt grope at noonday; thou shalt
not prosper in thy ways; and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled
evermore
thou shalt betroth a wife and another man shall lie with her; thou
shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein, and thine ox shall
be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof; thine ass shall
be violently taken away from before thy face and shall not be restored to
thee; they sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none
to rescue them.
Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given
unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing
for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.
The fruit of thy land, and all thy labors, shall a nation whom thou
knowest not eat up, and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed
always
"
Gary North explained:
"The point of Deuteronomy 28 is this: the way to
wealth, both individual and corporate, is through systematic adherence to Gods
Bible-revealed law."
[67]
Hence the idea that should a nation minister to the poor or attempt to lift
the poor out of poverty or save people from poverty and ill health, that
nation is contravening the will of Almighty God and such legislation is
contrary to the laws of God.
It is only one step further to say that if this
is Gods attitude toward the poor, it is morally wrong to help them. So its
easy to see how Social Security and Medicare are viewed by Dominionists as "evil" programs that rob money from some citizens to enrich others.
Theres one other little trap for the unwary Dominionist; when a government
is seen to be the enforcer of the Deuteronomic laws, its easy to take the
next step and say that it is the duty of the "christian" Dominionist
government to subdue the wicked of the world, especially the vast American
middle class, because its collective licentious life style is bringing the
nation down as a whole; therefore the government must "minister the wrath of
God" against the citizens of America as punishment for
"rebelliousness."
That the entire scheme is an unending circular argument, escapes the notice
of the rank and file sitting in the pews.
In their new role as ministers of Gods wrath against this nation,
Dominionist political strategists are aware they must not be seen as being
cruel and hateful. So at first, until the population is completely subdued
and dominated by the elect, Dominionists are forced to devise laws that will
create the political, social, and medical environment that will ultimately
ensure that the wicked are punished - but it will appear - at first blush to be
a gift.
The truth, of course, according to Machiavellian/Straussian
dictates, must be hidden from the population; not just once or twice, but
over and over again.
In the end, Dominionism should be viewed as a backboard that bounces the New
Deal and FDRs social safety net programs, social security (as well as
Medicare) into its political opposite: laissez-faire economics (the motto of
18th century French economists who protested excessive government regulation
of industry.)
Laissez-faire is a doctrine opposing governmental interference
(as by regulation or subsidy) in economic affairs beyond the minimum
necessary for the maintenance of peace and property rights. Dominionism
opposes the licensing and regulating power of the government.
One last comment on Pat Robertson.
On November 3, 1986, the 700 Club ran a
piece on the use of computers in counting votes. Robertson ended his
Perspective by saying there should be some kind of control on computer
voting to assure an honest count.
How prescient this man is! And how
worrisome his prescience is.
Who Is on the Side of Freedom? Let Him Speak Now!
There is an infection, a religious and political pathology that has
corrupted our churches. Those we trusted the most have embraced evil. That
knowledge is almost more than we can bear. Who among us will stand in the
gap and make up the hedge to save our nation?
When we look for help - for the wealthy leaders with the means to help rescue
America, we find they have all defected to the Dominionists. They do not
realize that if the middle class of America is wiped out - there will be no
one to buy their cars, their computers or their products.
Only one or two
brave souls like
George Soros have made massive contributions to combat the
think tanks and the organized political machine of the Dominionists. The
corporate press lies sleeping, not realizing they will be allowed to report
only what they are instructed to report.
Freedom is under siege. There is only one free major political party still
left in America. I know the Democrats look chaotic, unfocused and generally
unsmooth and thank God, unprogramed.
Make no mistake, these plain ordinary
citizens are holding the candles that together form the great torch of
liberty. For all their faults, they love America and they love freedom and
they love the Bill of Rights. Americas independents, its true
Conservatives, its sensible Republicans, and its Libertarians must join
hands together with the homely Democrats and take back America for all
Americans.
The livelihood of the working people of America is at stake. The
Dominionists have lost more American jobs in the last three years than since
the days of Herbert Hoover. And now they want to eliminate the minimum wage
laws too. Americas unions have helped to create a better life for millions
of workers. The Dominionists want to break all unions apart (especially the
teachers union).
As Americans, we love our schools and are proud of our
educational system. The Dominionists want to destroy all public education in
America and force Americans to be educated in their religious schools.
Americans love our culture and the arts. The Dominionists want to destroy
that culture.
The election of 2004 is not just another election. It is the battle of the
century. It is the gravest political war since the Civil War, which if lost,
spells the end of Independence Day and every right in the Bill of Rights
that we have fought so hard to preserve.
Is there an American, regardless of
his or her party, who would not fight for our Democracy? Its in jeopardy
now.
Our friends and cousins in Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand and
scores of other nations have seen our jeopardy and have been crying out for
months and days and years to wake up America!
Let me see your face and look into your eyes. Let me hear you say,
"There is no difference between the two
parties."
May God help us and grant us
discernment when we vote.

continued, "I am deeply disturbed by the dangerous and growing influence of

Former Governor of Delaware, Russ Peterson in his new book, Patriots, Stand
Up!, wrote, "Our cherished American way of life is under attack by the far
right-wing Republicans who are now running the White House, the Senate and

been growing over the past few decades through the use of evil tactics and
strategies, lies and deceptions to transform America.
"Deception is
now the hallmark of the Bush administration. Read of the frightening
chicanery in furthering an imperial strategy, nurturing the
military-industrial complex, waging war on the environment, plunging the
nation into debt, demeaning the needy, antagonizing the world and using
terrorism to frighten and exploit."
The author calls on patriots to apply the principles of democracy now to
retake America from a conservative elite that controls the country.

[13] Ben Kinchlow, co-host of the 700 Club with Pat Robertson, was made Vice
President of CBN in charge of CBNs charities program "Operation Blessing."
On March 27, 1985, while criticizing farmers for wanting a government
bailout he said: "Whats wrong in this country is that so many people have
substituted the government for God. Instead of looking to God to supply
their needs, theyre looking to government." Railing at financially stressed
people was very common on the show.
[14] Tim LaHaye predicted on Pat Robertsons 700 Club show on September 25,
1985 that 110,000 evangelical, fundamentalist, and Pentecostal churches
could sponsor one person per church to run for office and win, that in a
decade they would hold every office in the U.S. At the time, he said there
were only 97,000 public offices in the U.S. so "we would have more christians in office than there are positions." By 1994, for the first time
in forty years, Republicans regained control of Congress. Similarly Ralph
Reed predicted that by the year 2,000 they would control Congress. Gary
North wrote in 1985: "I propose a program. Some variant of this program must
be adopted if we are to have any meaningful hope in recapturing the
machinery of civil government, the media, and the educational institutions.
It will be done. It has already begun. How long it will take is
problematical; I think we will begin to see major victories before the year
2005." http://reformed-theology.org/ice/books/conspiracy/html/8.htm at page
5 of 11 pages.
[15] Francis Schaeffer originally appeared on the 700 Club with Pat
Robertson in 1982. The series of interviews with Schaeffer were repeated on
the show in the week of July 7, 1986 as Robertson presented the legal and
biblical foundations for christian political action. Francis Schaeffer,
however, died between the first and second airing. The Schaeffer interviews
were tape recorded and transcribed, my quotes are from my transcript. The
accuracy of my transcript can be compared to the video tapes of the shows.
At the time, People for the American Way were recording the shows and
establishing a Pat Robertson 700 Club library for future reference.
[16] All 700 Club quotes in this article were recorded and transcribed by
the author and her assistant unless otherwise indicated.
[17] Although neither Robertson nor Schaeffer used the words
"Dominionism"
or "dominion" in this interview series they used the word "dominant" when
asking which culture was dominant in the United States: the christian
culture or the humanistic culture. They asserted the humanistic culture was
the dominant force in America and "christians" had to regain dominance.
[18] The most successful ministers knew the psychological importance of
creating "enemies" that were attacking the church. Jerry Falwell maintains
the rule: "To be successful, keep a good fight going all the time."
[19] Psychiatrist Scott Peck has written about the phenomena groups resort
to almost universally in his book, The People of the Lie, "There are
profound forces at work within a group to keep its individual members
together and in line...Probably the most powerful of these group
cohesive forces is narcissism
group pride
.A less benign but practically
universal form of group narcissism is what might be called enemy
creation, or hatred of the out-group."

http://www.4religious-right.info/introduction2.htm
[21] In short, they needed a religion of their own to justify evil acts and
to counter the political acceptance by many christians who were attracted to
the communal and "communistic" principles of the early church (Acts
2:42-47), where the early christians sold all their possessions, gave them
to the needy, and held "all things [in] common." Such christian ideas were a
direct threat to capitalisms future robber barons. How could great fortunes
be amassed if one had to give it all away to the poor and follow Jesus?
(Matthew 19:16-30.)
[22] Pat Robertson is particularly adept at changing the issue from
questioning an aggressively religious political agenda into an attack on
religion. The Constitution prohibits a religious test for office in America
(Article 6). However, a battle over the nomination of Herb Ellingwood in
1985 to the position of Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy caused a
fire storm. (That office screens candidates for the federal judiciary.)
During the same period dominionists like Ellingwood and Tim LaHaye were
advocating that twenty-five percent of all government positions should be
handed to christian fundamentalists (dominionists) since they made up
twenty-five percent of the nations population. Pat Schroeder, former
Democratic congresswoman from Colorado and chairman of the Civil Service
Committee strongly opposed the view as a religious quota system and a
violation of Article VI of the Constitution. She said the questions that
were asked of judicial candidates, apparently prepared by Ellingwood,
amounted to a religious test for office. She spoke on the Phil Donahue show
on (September 6, 1985):
"If you look at some of the questions that
are being asked by some of the senators of judges, they dont have to do
with their background, their training, whether or not they understand
the law, they have to do with personal beliefs. Thats not where we have
been in the past, and thats a very dangerous turn
"
During the same period of time (August-September) Pat Robertson easily
turned the legitimate questioning of Herb Ellingwoods agenda into an attack
on christianity by framing it this way on his 700 Club Show on August 9,
1985:
"Can an evangelical christian hold high office in the United States of
America? Now that is the question. Or are evangelical christians going to be
discriminated against? And indeed will there be a religious test for public
office which disqualifies anybody who speaks to a religious group? . . .
.Herb Ellingwood is Chairman right now of the Merit Protection Review Board
and he has done a superb job. He was the former legal counsel to President
Reagan in California and has worked closely with Ed Meese for years. Hes
been a very distinguished attorney. It just seems like this campaign of
assassination that goes on against good men like that should be brought to a
stop. . .And if you feel that christians ought to be allowed to serve in
positions of responsibility in the government
and you dont think that
christians should be discriminated against
heres the number of the White
House: 202 446-7639
" (700 Club 8-9-85)
[23] One cannot help comparing this passage with the fact that 27,000 bombs
were dropped on Iraq in the 2003 air war and in a demonstration of cold
indifference, the Bush administration ignored the advice of prominent
archeologists to protect Iraqs museums, which contained the greatest
collection of ancient relics, art, and ancient treasures in the world, and
in so doing, allowed the looting - the despoiling - of that nations treasures.
[24]Again, because we will learn in this article that Machiavelli is a
handbook in the Bush administration, one must ask if the George W. Bush
administration perceives despoiling as a plan of action to control the
American populace. The question must be asked.

[27] Robertsons and Ledeens relationship continues. For a recent CBN
interview of Ledeen conducted by Pat Robertson and transcribed by CBN.com go
to: http://cbn.com/CBNNews/News/030623e.asp?option=print
[28] Ledeen tried to arrange the sale of arms to Iran in order to divert the
profits to the Contra militants who were fighting the Nicaraguan
governments Sandinistas. However, Congress had voted to cut off U.S. aid to
the Contras and therefore any such transaction was illegal.
[29] William O. Beemans article,
"Who Is Michael Ledeen?" was published on
May 8, 2003 and may be read at the alternet.org: http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=15860
[30] Gerard Thomas Straub worked at CBS for eight years before joining the
700 Club as executive producer. After leaving CBNs employment, he went to
work for ABCs "General Hospital" as associate producer. His 1986 book,
Salvation for Sale, (Prometheus Books, N.Y.) offers insights to how Pat
Robertson conducted business off camera from the perspective of an insider.
The dichotomy between his public friendly "pastoral" role and his actual
business conduct is stark evidence that he understood Machiavellis rule
that only appearance counts. Straub wrote: "In reality Pat is a pompous pope
of the video Vatican of christian broadcasting, and he rules his empire with
absolute authority. He does not tolerate debate, discussions, or dissent
His
television followers never get to see the tough-minded, hard-driving
cut-throat leader." In addition, over the years, Pat Robertson revealed his
Machiavellian political philosophy repeatedly and openly on his show in
discussions of how to handle foreign policy and in his ruthless approach to
the poor and needy of America.
[31] On June 19, 1985: Danuta Soderman, the second member of Pat Robertsons
daily team, asked Pat Robertson how the United States should deal with
middle-east terrorist groups: "Speaking about being decisive in dealing with
terrorists groups, yesterday you offered some opinion on how Iran should be
one of the places we should target our energies on; any other thoughts on
this?
Robertson: "Just like the last guest in that clip our news department did,
he said its pretty much undeclared war. Khomeini has declared war against
the United States. He has told people that if they die against the infidel,
they go to heaven. The Islamic Jihad is controlled out of Iran, and the
other factor of course is Syria, which is giving some sanctuary to all of
these people. Syria controls the Becca Valley now - practically all of it,
since Israel withdrew its forces. So up in the Becca Valley the Shiite
Muslims from Iran are forcing the Lebanese women to wear veils and
practice the various extreme views of the Islamic faith in the Shiite
traditions. Weve got to go after the source. If you want to go after a
snake you dont cut inches off his tail."
Robertson also focused on the Becca Valley on July 12, 1985 and on several
other occasions. The refrain has not changed in nineteen years. A recent
January 2004 article published in the Jerusalem Post states Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld is considering invading the Becca Valley, which is
still controlled by Syria.

Nation; October 7, 2002 at http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20021007&s=williams
Not only is the concept of "original intent brilliant and revolutionary, it
in fact goes further than any other political format to legitimize the
conversion of present day jurisprudence back to the judicial weltanschauung
(world view) of eighteenth century jurists. It is the key factor in the Dominionists intent to establish biblical law over all Americans. Two
Supreme Court justices subscribe to it already. In other words, as Law
Professor Patricia J. Williams has pointed out, the rule would effectively
repeal most of the judicial decisions made in the last century.

[48] Social Darwinism is the discredited extension of Darwins evolutionary
theory to the human social condition. Social Darwinism takes Charles
Darwins concept, "the survival of the fittest," and applies it to the idea
that the ladder to material wealth and to the "good life" may be climbed
only after one has successfully engaged in group battles and conflicts and
prevailed in the pit of life by drop kicking ones opponents. Those who
climb out of the pit and up the ladder become the socially recognized
victors in the competition and are considered biologically superior to those
who fail. The illogical fallout from this concept is the circular argument
that the existence of a socially elite class must be proof that those who
possess wealth and power are necessarily superior to those in economic
classes below them.
[49] Dominionists may argue with some credibility that they do believe in
helping the poor; however, they want churches to undertake that task and
adamantly fight against government social aid programs funded from tax
monies - unless of course - it is a so-called "faith based" initiative. Pat
Robertson forgot his objections to the government handing out money and
gratefully accepted the $500,000 Mr. Bush sent him early in his
administration for "good faith based charitable work." Regardless of their
protestations, however, the churches of America cannot and do not have the
billions of dollars to provide the social safety net for the poor, elderly
and sick among Americas population. In 1985, for example, Robertson bragged CBN gave $50 million worth of food, clothes, and supplies to 8.5 million
people, but that was what he called "leveraged" contributions, in which CBN
had joined with other charities. Robertson admitted they gave only $10
million. Deducting the $2 million of CBNs contributions to the Contras in
Central America, CBNs total contribution amounted to only about
eighty-eight cents to every hungry, needy person he said CBN helped.
[50] Pat Robertson wrote in The Secret Kingdom:
"Unhappily, evangelical christians have for too long reduced the born-again experience to the issue
of being saved. Salvation is an important issue, obviously, and must never
be deemphasized. But rebirth must be seen as a beginning, not an arrival. It
provides access to the invisible world, the kingdom of God, of which we are
to learn and experience and then share with others. Jesus Himself said it
clearly before His ascension: All authority has been given to Me in heaven
and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching
them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even
to the end of the age. [Matthew 28:18-20 New American Standard Bible]. The
commission was to make followers and learners - converts - and to teach them the
principles of the kingdom. Entry into the body of believers was not enough.
They were to learn how to live in this world
The invisible was to rule the
visible. Christ has authority over both." Emphasis is Robertsons. (p. 51)

Republican Party of Texas reaffirms the United States of America is a christian Nation ...
"1. GOVERNMENT: We reclaim freedom of religious expression in public on
government property, and freedom from government interference. Support
government display of Ten Commandments.
Dispel the "myth" of the separation of church and state. A strong and
vibrant private sector [should be] unencumbered by excessive government
regulation. Oppose Campaign Finance Reform. Oppose any form of gun control.
Abolish: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; Position of Surgeon
General; EPA; Department of Energy; Department of Housing and Urban
Development; Department of Education; Department of Commerce and Labor;
National Endowment for the Arts.
"2. ECONOMY: Abolish the dollar in favor of the gold standard. Abolish the
IRS. Eliminate income tax, inheritance tax, gift tax, capital gains,

... Gradually phase out Social Security tax for a system of private
pensions.
"3. UNITED NATIONS: .. We immediately rescind our membership in, as well as
all financial and military contributions to the United Nations." We should "
... evict the United Nations from the United States and eliminate any
further participation.
"4. FAMILY: We believe that traditional marriage is a legal and moral
commitment between a man and a woman. We recognize that the family is the
foundational unit of a healthy society and consists of those related by
blood, marriage, or adoption. The family is responsible for its own welfare,
education, moral training, conduct, and property.
"The practice of sodomy tears at the heart of our society... The party oppose[s] decriminalization of sodomy. Oppose all forms of abortion - even
in cases of rape or incest. We unequivocally oppose United States Senate

"5. EDUCATION: We call for the abolition of the U.S. Department of Education
and the prohibition of the transfer of any of its functions to any other
federal agency.
"Support official prayer in public schools Oppose Early Childhood
Development Programs. We support ... a program based upon biblical
principles... Terminate bilingual education. Since Secular Humanism is
recognized by the United States Supreme Court as a religion ... Secular
Humanism should be subjected to the same state and federal laws as any other
recognized religions.
"6. THE ENVIRONMENT: Oppose the myth of global warming. Reaffirm the belief
in the fundamental right of an individual to use property without
governmental interference. Oppose EPA management of Texas air quality.
"7. THE MIDDLE EAST: ... Jerusalem is the capital of Israel ...
therefore, the United States should move its embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem."
