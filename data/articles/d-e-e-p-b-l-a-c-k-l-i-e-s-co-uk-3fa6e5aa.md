APPENDIX

HOLY SMOKE AND
MIRRORS
By David Guyatt
Albert
Vincent Carone is one of those people who spent his life
dancing between raindrops and turning invisible wherever a
shadow lingered. He
existed and also didnt exist.
Al Carone - unlike his near namesake, Al Capone
truly was a paradox wrapped in a mystery concealed behind an
enigma.
Carone
was a detective in the New York Police Department, but this
didnt stop him from becoming a made man in the
Genovese crime family. He
knew all the leading Mafiosa of his day, including Vito
Genovese, Sam Giancana, Santos Trafficante, Joe Colombo and
Pauley Castellano amongst others.
To Carones daughter, Dee, they were all known as
Uncle. When
she got married, her father arranged two different reception
rooms to separate the mob guests, from the NYPD guests.
But this was more window-dressing than anything else.
One of Carones principal functions in the NYPD was
to act as the bagman in protecting shipments of CIA
drugs to the various Mafia families.
Carone
died in 1990 under mysterious circumstances.
This followed a period of great personal disenchantment
with his life following a secretive mission to Mexico in 1985
when a large number of innocent women and children died
unnecessarily. His
death was horrific, reports Mike Ruppert, editor of From
The Wilderness newsletter, who has investigated Carones
life story and written a special report on it (see
acknowledgements).
Meanwhile,
another Uncle was Bill Casey, the former Director of the
CIA during the Reagan administration.
Casey had been with the OSS during WW11.
During the seventies he became Chairman of the
Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) that regulates the
US investment industry. During his tenor in that role, Casey used Carone as a
cut-out to pass sensitive insider information to mob
Capo, Pauley Castellano, says his daughter, Dee.
Carone
was also a full Colonel in the US Army where he had operated
in the Armys Counter Intelligence Corp (CIC).
Unsurprisingly, in view of his close friendship with
Bill Casey, he was also a covert operative for the CIA.
But that wasnt half of it.
Carone was also a Grand Knight of the Sovereign
Military Order of Malta (SMOM) which historically has been
the military arm of the Vatican and is regarded as separate
state with full powers of statehood including issuing
its own diplomatic passports.
In
more recent decades SMOM has acted as a funding conduit, a
black market gold channel and money-laundry for the CIA,
amongst others and is known to act as the Vaticans
intelligence arm. It
was, for example, alleged to be involved in the disappearance
of Russias gold reserves over 2000 metric tonnes - that
vanished during 1991, around the time that Soviet Premier
Mikhail Gorbachev was ousted from office.
Malta
knighthoods are awarded to many leading individuals who are
part of the military and intelligence community.
The CIAs Bill Casey, for example, was Knight of
Malta. Former
NATO General (and later US Secretary of State) Alexander Haig
is also a Malta Knight. Another is General Vernon Walters, the former Deputy Director
of the CIA under DCI George Bush and later appointed a roving
Ambassador during the Reagan administration.
The legendary head of the OSS the WW11 precursor of
the CIA was Wild Bill Donovan, who was made a Knight
along with his wartime compatriot and later CIA chief of
counter-intelligence, James Jesus Angleton. And John McCone, another prominent member of the US
spook agency was also distinguished with a Malta
knighthood. The
list goes on. Most interesting was Reinhard Gehlen the former Nazi
intelligence expert recruited by the US in 1945-46 to head the
Gehlen Org a secret German-based intelligence arm of
the United States that was composed of former SS & Gestapo
agents many of whom, including Klaus Barbie, were wanted
Nazi war criminals. The
foregoing names amount to a listing of some of the most
powerful and influential members of the western intelligence
community over the last five decades.
One
Vatican group that has extremely close ties to the Knights of
Malta is the ultra right wing Opus Dei.
This is an immensely powerful faction in the Vatican
today, whose public do good activities eclipse a
plethora of the darkest political and financial machinations
known to man. It
will not come as a surprise, perhaps, that Carone was closely
associated with Opus Dei and, in particular, a covert
operation that had its origin back in 1944.
This was Operation Amadeus.
THE DULLES FACTOR
This
highly secretive operation was part of the Operation
Sunrise negotiations conducted between Allen Dulles
the then senior wartime OSS officer in Switzerland, but
later to become the Director of the CIA and SS General
Karl Wolff. This
debonair and well-connected SS officer commanded the SS and
Gestapo contingents in Italy at the time.
The result of these negotiations (at least those parts
that are now known about) was an agreement affording amnesty
to an extensive roster of SS-Gestapo forces - in exchange for
their agreement to shift their allegiance to the West in the
pre-planned covert battle aimed at defeating the Soviet
communist menace. In
other words the cold war.
One
spin-off of these Dulles-Wolff arrangements were the Vatican
run rat-lines that aided wanted Nazi war criminals to
slink to safety. Tens
of thousands of SS and others Nazis escaped capture as a
result of the ratlines. These
included such figures as Franz Stangl, commandant at Treblinka
extermination camp and his friend, Gustav Wagner, who ran the
Sobibor death camp. Others
to escape in this manner included Adolf Eichmann, the
architect of the Holocaust.
Eichmann was later captured by Israeli intelligence
agents, smuggled to Tel Aviv where he stood trial and was
eventually executed. In
comparison, Dr. Joseph Mengele known as the White
Angel a war criminal wanted for his cruel and inhuman
experiments on death camp inmates at Auschwitz, escaped to
Argentina and lived a long life.
Operation
Amadeus
was exclusively concerned with the flight of SS and Nazi war
criminals to the South American continent and their later
ferocious covert actions against the indigenous populations
justified under the banner of anti-communism.
One individual engaged in Amadeus activities was former
Gestapo officer, Klaus Barbie, known to the world as the
Butcher of Lyon.
The
principal means of funding Operation Amadeus activities was
the hugely profitable narcotics business.
Large stocks of SS Morphia had been smuggled out of
Europe and into catholic, South America at the end of
the war in accordance with the Sunrise agreement.
The Morphia was accompanied by looted SS gold and large
quantities of counterfeit British banknotes forged in
concentration camps by captive but skilled counterfeiters as
part of an SS scheme known as Operation Bernhardt.
The
escape lines used to move wanted men around South
America away from the prying eyes of Israeli agents also
proved ideal as smuggling routes for drugs.
Decades later the stocks of Heroin smuggled to the
United States for distribution by the CIA protected Mafia,
would be complimented with locally grown Cocaine.
One of the figures to emerge in to the spotlight during
the 1980s who was deeply involved in this narcotics traffic
was Colonel Oliver North who authorised the exchange of
guns for drugs to finance Contra operations.
Oliver North
was known to Al Carone under his work name, John
Caffrey. This
was the time when Carone was engaged in CIA controlled cocaine
transactions with Joe Pickles Percilia, a member of the
Columbo crime family.
These
curious and usually concealed connections between governments
in the form of the military and intelligence community
organised crime, the Vatican and Nazi war criminals have some
significant history. Not
least was the secret agreement reached between US Naval
intelligence officers, and Mafia don, Charles Lucky
Luciano, during WW11. This
resulted in the Mafias decision to aid and assist the
Allies by contacting mob figure, Vito Genovese, in 1943 to
prepare the way for the Allied landing in Sicily. As earlier outlined, it was primarily those SS-Gestapo units
located in Italy under command of SS General Wolff that were
initially concerned in the Operation Sunrise negotiations.
And
while large numbers of former Nazis were fleeing south to
fight the communist menace is Latin America and, more
importantly, to personally profit from their involvement in
the lucrative drug and gun business - in Europe, the spadework
was being laid to overthrow, or thwart, democratically elected
governments via a network of fascist-manned Stay Behind
Units, organised under the aegis of Operation Gladio.
Not surprisingly this would also lead to certain
involved figures making personal fortunes out of other
peoples misery a circumstance that is so common-place
it is barely worth mentioning.
These
neo-fascist activities would come to prominence in the early
eighties following the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano and the
death of Italian banker, Roberto Calvi who was suicided
and left hanging under Londons Blackfriars bridge.
This would lead to sensational disclosures about the
role of the Vatican bank, the IOR, in Calvis financial
empire and would quickly grow to include the activities of
Mafia financier, Michele Sindona whos activities, in
turn, would implicate leading blue-blood banks in Europe and
America in Mafia activities.
Both Sindona and Calvi were close to Opus Dei who lost
around $55 million when Sindonas empire crashed.
According to his family, Roberto Calvi was deeply
engrossed in helping Opus Dei take control of the IOR when he
was killed.
Meanwhile,
both Calvi and Sindona were members of the secretive
Propaganda Due (P2) Masonic lodge, that is said to have been a
parallel government in waiting and which planned to
effect a coup detat in Italy following a communist party
victory at the polls.
P2
was run by former Italian fascist and member of the Nazi SS,
Licio Gelli dubbed the Puppet Master by the Italian
press. Gellis connections to the ultra hard right and fascists in
Europe and Latin America were extensive.
In fact, he had been deeply involved in establishing
the Vatican run Ratlines that aided the worst Nazi war
criminals to escape Allied justice at the end of WW11.
All told an estimated 50,000 Nazis were helped to
freedom.
Gelli
had numerous powerful friends including former Italian
dictator, Benito Mussolini.
He was also a personal friend of Argentinas General
Juan Peron and his close associations with Argentina would
later lead him to be a key figure in shipping a supply of
French made Exocet missiles to sink British Task Force ships
during the Falklands war.
In this endeavour he worked closely with Ronald R
Rewald, founder of the Hawaiian based financial institution
Bishop, Baldwin, Rewald, Dillingham & Wong a CIA
proprietary company and forerunner of the CIA owned Nugan Hand
bank.
The
involvement of a CIA front company engaged in financing and
providing weapons to be used against a key American ally
(Britain) that had the whole-hearted public support of the US
government, may seem somewhat duplicitous.
However, in the world of black ops friends
and enemies are interchangeable words and working both
sides of the fence is accepted practice.
In terms of hierarchy, Gelli reported to Umberto
Ortolani, described by one writer as the great Vatican door
opener and a secret chamberlain of the Papal
Household. In
addition to his P2 connections, Ortolani is also a member of
the inner council of the Knights of Malta and has military
intelligence connections that date back to WW11.
THE
OCTOPUS AND THE SPIDER
There
are numerous other Masonic groups and secret societies in
Europe that move in and out of focus at various times.
Almost all of them are catholic in nature. One of these is the Priory of Sion a secretive order that
first came to public attention in the best selling book
Holy Blood Holy Grail, published in 1982.
The Priory is closely connected with the alleged
treasure of Solomon that is said to have found its way to the
small village of Rennes Le Chateau in south western France
where it is said to have been buried by the Knights Templars;
forerunners of the Knights of Malta.
The
Priory, whose headquarters were located at Annemasse, near
Geneva on the Swiss border, are styled as the Guardians
of Solomons treasure but most interestingly, they have
numerous subterranean connections to fascists and those on the
far right that date back to WW11.
Meanwhile, it has to be noted in passing, that
Annemasse is said to have been the centre for the
anti-communist Stay Behind units of Operation Gladio.
If
this is not intriguing enough, another fact stretches
co-incidence to the point of bursting.
In recent years the Priory of Sion has moved its
headquarters to Barcelona and now boasts a Spanish Grand
Master. This, one
could conclude, is to enable it to be physically closer to the
historical heartland of Opus Dei, which was founded in Spain
in 1928.
If
Otto Skorzeny was a leading force in running the SS
Brotherhood escape routes (Der Spinne the Spider) after
the war, and SS General Karl Wolff was the lead negotiator
with OSS Swiss Chief, Allen Dulles, then another Nazi, Walter
Rauff - head of the Milan SD - was one of two liaisons with
the Vatican involved in the establishment of the Nazi
smuggling system. Earlier in his career, Rauff had overseen the development of
the Nazi mobile gas vans, known as Black Ravens that
gassed to death around 100,000 Jews mostly women and
children - by pumping exhaust fumes into the back of a
hermetically sealed van.
Another
important link between the Vatican and SS escape routes was
Friedrich Schwendt, who was also the man in charge of
laundering forged SS banknotes.
Before the war, Schwendt was an international arms
dealer shipping weapons to China and Russia.
He was also the investment manager of the family
fortune of his first wifes aunt, Baroness Gemmingen-Guttenberg,
of the vastly wealthy Argentine based Bunge family of the
massive transnational firm Bunge Corporation that is also
known as the Octopus.
This
title is interesting for it may connect to the so called
Octopus that ties-in to murdered Freelance journalist,
Danny Casolaro who at the time of his death was investigating
a number of high level illegalities including the theft by the
Department of Justice, of a tracking computer programme
known as PROMIS. Casolaro
was writing a book about what he had discovered.
He originally titled it Behold, a Pale Horse but
later modified it to The Octopus.
In a draft page of the book he described this group as
an:
international
cabal who freelance services covered parochial political
intrigue, espionage,
sophisticated weapon technologies that included biotoxins,
drug trafficking, money laundering and murder-for hire.
Casolaro
further stated that this cabal had its origins spawned
thirty years ago in the shadow of the cold war.
After Casolaros death, journalist Carol Marshall (a
pen name) followed up his investigation and wrote an [as yet]
unpublished manuscript titled The Last Circle.
In this, Marshall describes her investigation of Robert
Booth Nichols one of the central figures of the Octopus
whom she describes as being part of a secretive group known as
The Chosen Ones and who wore skull and crossbones
rings, and shared a common interest, if you could call it
that, in the old German SS occultism, its tribal and inner
circle rites.
During
her continuing investigation into the Octopus, Marshall found
that the SS occultism outlined above was connected to Lt. Col.
Michael A. Aquino, a former US Green Beret, who is a
self professed Satanist and who held a top secret security
clearance for his work in military intelligence and on
classified psychological warfare matters.
Aquino officiated at SS black magic ceremonies held at
Wewelsburg, the Castle once used by SS chief Heinrich Himmler
to create an SS order of Teutonic Knights based on the Knights
Templars.
The
foregoing connections lend themselves to a larger picture of
global interlocking right wing fascist groupings that operate
in the shadow-land of deniable military and intelligence
operations associated with profit during WW11 and, later,
throughout the cold war.
In this respect it is intriguing to note that the
Priory of Sion, one of the foremost Catholic groups under
discussion use as a symbol something that is variously
described as an octopus or a spider (laraignee) on their
documents.
The
Priory association with the octopus could easily relate to the
so-called Octopus described above where organised crime
work hand in glove with operatives from US intelligence and
the military. If
one decides, on the other hand, that the Priory symbol is a
spider, there is the intriguing notion of the Vatican run Nazi
escape lines of Austrian Catholic, Otto Skorzeny and his
SS Brotherhoods Der Spinne the spider.
THE
BUSINESS OF GOD
Al
Carone was, as mentioned earlier, a made man of the
Genovese mob in addition to his other associations. It is curious, therefore, to note that one of the leading
lights of the Octopus, according to writer, Carol
Marshall, was ultra right-wing oil tycoon, Clint Murchison
owner of the Dallas Cowboys football team.
Murchisons oil company, Murchison Oil Lease
Company was 20% owned by Gerardo Catena, the chief
lieutenant of the Genovese crime family.
Throughout
the second world war and thereafter there was, according to
author Charles Higham, in his book Trading With The
Enemy, a general agreement of certain major figures of
American, British and German commerce to continue their
relations and associations after Pearl Harbour.
Higham adds that he had also learned that certain
figures of the warring governments had arranged to assist in
this [activity]. Highams
subsequent research proved the existence of this high cabal
that he dubbed The Fraternity not only existed but
benefited handsomely throughout WW11.
This led the author to ask:
What
would have happened if millions of Americans and British
people, struggling with coupons and lines at the gas stations,
had learned that in 1942 Standard Oil of New jersey managers
shipped the enemys fuel through neutral Switzerland and
that the enemy was shipping Allied fuel?
Suppose the public had discovered that the Chase Bank
in Nazi-occupied Paris after Pearl Harbour was doing millions
of dollars worth of business with the enemy with the full
knowledge of the head office in Manhattan? Or that Ford trucks were being built for the German
occupation troops in France with authorisation from Dearborn,
Michigan? Or that
Colonel Sothenes Behn, the head of the international American
telephone conglomerate ITT, flew from New York to Madrid to
Berne during the war to help improve Hitlers communications
systems and improve the robot bombs that devastated London? Or that ITT built the Focke-Wulfs that dropped bombs on
British and American troops?
Or that crucial ball bearings were shipped to Nazi
associated customers in Latin America with the collusion of
the vice-chairman of the U.S. War Production Board in
partnership with Gorings cousin in Philadelphia when
American forces were desperately short of them?
Or that such arrangements were known about in
Washington and either sanctioned or deliberately ignored?
Highams
Fraternity has similar characteristics to the so-called
Octopus and also shows certain similarities to Colonel
Oliver Norths Enterprise.
All have engaged in the most dubious and illegal
activities for profit and all operate hand in glove with
organised crime. All
lean so far to the right, ideologically speaking, that the
word fascist can be used without reservation.
Meanwhile, none of them care very much for the woes of
humanity and, indeed, appear committed to stomping on ethics
and moral values wherever they meet them.
The
Octopus or Oct Opus as one European documentary film
producer renders the spelling when referring to Opus Dei
(which began life on 2 October 1928) - has eight
arms that surround its mouth (ensuring a constant supply of
food) and three hearts and is not, therefore, conducive to
starving or dying. But
it can also be identified by these oddities.
Opus Dei, the group that are now in control of the
Vatican are undoubtedly one arm of this global criminal
network, in this writers view.
Or
are the three hearts of the Octopus more vital to identify?
Could they be analogous to the Church, State, and
Mafia, the forces that prevail beneath the play of the shadows
of the world
as described by Nick Tosches in his book
Power On Earth that tells the life story of murdered
Mafia financier Michele Sindona?
There
is yet another interesting twist to this accumulation of
associations: Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.
The prince was the founding chairman of the publicity
shy western power elite, the Bilderbergers. This shadowy and secretive group meet over a weekend in May
each year under an almost total media blackout.
Powerful and very influential figures from the world of
banking, business, politics, the media, trades unions and
academia are invited. Included
regularly, for example, are Dr. Henry Kissinger, David
Rockerfeller, Italys kingmaker Gianni Agnelli and other
illustrious figures. The
first meeting took place in May 1954.
This,
strangely, was the same year that Prince Bernhard became head
of the Johanitter Orde in Nederland, one of four Orders that
make up the Chivalric Alliance of Orders of Saint John (Alliance
de Chevalerie des Hospitaliers de Saint Jean de Jerusalem). The stated purpose of these four, known as the Alliance
that are composed of North European nations (Germany,
Nederland, Sweden and Great Britain (the latter being an
ancient order known as the Most Venerable Order) is to:
to reduce to silence the enemies of Christ."
The headquarters of the Alliance is located in
Switzerland.
These
are protestant orders rather than catholic, but it is of
significance that 26th November 1963, the Alliance
was consolidated with the signing of a joint declaration
between the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Most
Venerable Order, at St John's Gate, London, by the Grand
Chancellor of the SMOM, the Prince of Resuttano, and Lord
Wakehurst, Lord Prior of the Most Venerable Order. In other words the Catholic and Protestant Orders bound
themselves to work together to silence the enemies of
Christ a clear reference to Communism.
Interestingly,
it has been suggested that the Knights Templars were
infected with the Johannite or Mandaean heresy that
denounced Jesus as a false prophet recognising, in his
place, John the Baptist, as the true Messiah.
Meanwhile, two early Grand Masters of the Prieure of
Sion are said to have had Johannite tendencies.
These were Leonardo Da Vinci and Sir Isaac Newton.
Not-with-standing that, the famous founder of the
Knights Templars, Hughes de Payens has been accused by the
Vatican to have been a Johannite.
Leaving
aside this brief foray into esoteric history it is as well to
note that Prince Bernhard, in addition to his Bilderberg role
and as head of the Dutch Johannite Order was also an honorary
member of Himmlers SS and worked in NW7 the global
intelligence arm of I.G. Farben that acted in the interests of
the Nazi cause. The
activities of NW7 in Latin America before, during and after
WW11 deeply interweave with this story.
In
facilitating and aligning itself with many of the foregoing
activities, the Vatican aimed to help eradicate a communist
ideology that despised Christianity.
Opus Dei and a host of other Catholic-cum-fascist
secret groups engaged in a litany of murder, money laundering,
drug peddling, arms trafficking, concealing WW11 loot,
embezzlement, manipulation of financial markets and many other
consummate illegalities.
The purpose of all these activities was, arguably, to
allow the Vatican to remain the spiritual bulwark of the
Christian west.
But
if such business is the business of a church preaching of a
God in Heaven, then Cesar on earth had better watch out
a
new landlord has fallen into town.
