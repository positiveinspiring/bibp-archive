ARE YOU ON THE LIST?
The federal government has been developing a
highly classified plan that will override the Constitution in the event of a
major terrorist attack

In the spring of 2007, a retired senior official in the U.S. Justice
Department sat before Congress and told a story so odd and ominous, it could
have sprung from the pages of a pulp political thriller. It was about a
principled bureaucrat struggling to protect his country from a highly
classified program with sinister implications.
Rife with high drama, it
included a car chase through the streets of Washington, D.C., and a tense
meeting at the White House, where the president's henchmen made the
bureaucrat so nervous that he demanded a neutral witness be present.
The bureaucrat was James Comey, John Ashcroft's second-in-command at the
Department of Justice during Bush's first term.
Comey had been a loyal
political foot soldier of the Republican Party for many years. Yet in his
testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he described how he had
grown increasingly uneasy reviewing the Bush administration's various
domestic surveillance and spying programs.
Much of his testimony centered on
an operation so clandestine he wasn't allowed to name it or even describe
what it did. He did say, however, that he and Ashcroft had discussed the
program in March 2004, trying to decide whether it was legal under federal
statutes. Shortly before the certification deadline, Ashcroft fell ill with
pancreatitis, making Comey acting attorney general, and Comey opted not to
certify the program.
When he communicated his decision to the White House,
Bush's men told him, in so many words, to take his concerns and stuff them
in an undisclosed location.
Comey refused to knuckle
under, and the dispute came to a head on the cold night of March 10, 2004,
hours before the program's authorization was to expire. At the time,
Ashcroft was in intensive care at George Washington Hospital following
emergency surgery.
Apparently, at the behest of President Bush himself, the
White House tried, in Comey's words, "to take advantage of a very sick man,"
sending Chief of Staff Andrew Card and then-White House counsel Alberto
Gonzales on a mission to Ashcroft's sickroom to persuade the heavily doped
attorney general to override his deputy.
Apprised of their mission, Comey,
accompanied by a full security detail, jumped in his car, raced through the
streets of the capital, lights blazing, and "literally ran" up the hospital
stairs to beat them there.
Minutes later, Gonzales and Card arrived with an envelope filled with the
requisite forms. Ashcroft, even in his stupor, did not fall for their
heavy-handed ploy.
"I'm not the attorney general," Ashcroft told Bush's men.
"There" - he pointed weakly to Comey - "is the attorney general."
Gonzales and
Card were furious, departing without even acknowledging Comey's presence in
the room. The following day, the classified domestic spying program that
Comey found so disturbing went forward at the demand of the White
House - "without a signature from the Department of Justice attesting as to
its legality," he testified.
What was the mysterious program that had so alarmed Comey?
Political blogs
buzzed for weeks with speculation. Though Comey testified that the program
was subsequently readjusted to satisfy his concerns, one can't help
wondering whether the unspecified alteration would satisfy constitutional
experts, or even average citizens. Faced with push-back from his bosses at
the White House, did he simply relent and accept a token concession?
Two
months after Comey's testimony to Congress, the New York Times reported a
tantalizing detail: The program that prompted him,
"to threaten resignation
involved computer searches through massive electronic databases."
The larger
mystery remained intact, however.
"It is not known precisely why searching
the databases, or data mining, raised such a furious legal debate," the
article conceded.
ONE NATION, UNDER SURVEILLANCE

Another clue came from a rather unexpected source: President
Bush himself.
Addressing the nation from the Oval Office in 2005 after the first
disclosures of the NSA's warrantless electronic surveillance became public,
Bush insisted that the spying program in question was reviewed "every 45
days" as part of planning to assess threats to "the continuity of our
government."
Few Americans - professional journalists included - know anything about
so-called Continuity of Government (COG) programs, so it's no surprise that
the president's passing reference received almost no attention. COG resides
in a nebulous legal realm, encompassing national emergency plans that would
trigger the takeover of the country by extra-constitutional forces - and
effectively suspend the republic.
In short, it's a road map for martial law.
While Comey, who left the Department of Justice in 2005, has steadfastly
refused to comment further on the matter, a number of former government
employees and intelligence sources with independent knowledge of domestic
surveillance operations claim the program that caused the flap between Comey
and the White House was related to a database of Americans who might be
considered potential threats in the event of a national emergency.
Sources
familiar with the program say that the government's data gathering has been
overzealous and probably conducted in violation of federal law and the
protection from unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by the Fourth
Amendment.
According to a senior government official who served with high-level
security clearances in five administrations,
"There exists a database of
Americans, who, often for the slightest and most trivial reason, are
considered unfriendly, and who, in a time of panic, might be incarcerated.
The database can identify and locate perceived 'enemies of the state' almost
instantaneously."
He and other sources tell Radar that the database is
sometimes referred to by the code name Main Core.
One knowledgeable source
claims that 8 million Americans are now listed in Main Core as potentially
suspect. In the event of a national emergency, these people could be subject
to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct
questioning and possibly even detention.
DESPERATE TIMES
Should another 9/11 occur, Continuity of Governance plans
developed during the Cold War go into effect
(Photo: Getty Images)
Of course, federal law is somewhat vague as to what might constitute a
"national emergency." Executive orders issued over the past three decades
define it as a,
"natural disaster, military attack, [or] technological or
other emergency," while Department of Defense documents include
eventualities like "riots, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful
obstructions or assemblages, [and] disorder prejudicial to public law and
order."
According to one news report, even "national opposition to U.S.
military invasion abroad" could be a trigger.
Let's imagine a harrowing scenario: coordinated bombings in several American
cities culminating in a major blast - say, a suitcase nuke - in New York City.
Thousands of civilians are dead. Commerce is paralyzed. A state of emergency
is declared by the president.
Continuity of Governance plans that were
developed during the Cold War and aggressively revised since 9/11 go into
effect. Surviving government officials are shuttled to protected underground
complexes carved into the hills of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.
Power shifts to a "parallel government" that consists of scores of secretly
preselected officials. (As far back as the 1980s, Donald Rumsfeld, then CEO
of a pharmaceutical company, and Dick Cheney, then a congressman from
Wyoming, were slated to step into key positions during a declared
emergency.) The executive branch is the sole and absolute seat of authority,
with Congress and the judiciary relegated to advisory roles at best.
The
country becomes, within a matter of hours, a police state.
Interestingly, plans drawn up during the Reagan administration
suggest this parallel government would be ruling under authority given by
law to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, home of the same hapless
bunch that recently proved themselves unable to distribute water to
desperate hurricane victims.
The agency's incompetence in tackling natural
disasters is less surprising when one considers that, since its inception in
the 1970s, much of its focus has been on planning for the survival of the
federal government in the wake of a decapitating nuclear strike.
Under law, during a national emergency,
FEMA and its parent organization,
the
Department of Homeland Security, would be empowered to seize private and
public property, all forms of transport, and all food supplies. The agency
could dispatch military commanders to run state and local governments, and
it could order the arrest of citizens without a warrant, holding them
without trial for as long as the acting government deems necessary.
From the
comfortable perspective of peaceful times, such behavior by the government
may seem far-fetched. But it was not so very long ago that FDR ordered
120,000 Japanese Americans - everyone from infants to the elderly - be held in
detention camps for the duration of World War II. This is widely regarded as
a shameful moment in U.S. history, a lesson learned.
But a long trail of
federal documents indicates that the possibility of large-scale detention
has never quite been abandoned by federal authorities. Around the time of
the 1968 race riots, for instance, a paper drawn up at the U.S. Army War
College detailed plans for rounding up millions of "militants" and "American
negroes," who were to be held at "assembly centers or relocation camps."
In
the late 1980s, the Austin American-Statesman and other publications
reported the existence of 10 detention camp sites on military facilities
nationwide, where hundreds of thousands of people could be held in the event
of domestic political upheaval.
More such facilities were commissioned in
2006, when Kellogg Brown & Root - then a subsidiary of Halliburton - was handed
a $385 million contract to establish,
"temporary detention and processing
capabilities" for the Department of Homeland Security. The contract is short
on details, stating only that the facilities would be used for "an emergency
influx of immigrants, or to support the rapid development of new programs."
Just what those "new programs" might be is not specified.

In the days after our hypothetical terror attack, events might play out like
this: With the population gripped by fear and anger, authorities undertake
unprecedented actions in the name of public safety.
Officials at the
Department of Homeland Security begin actively scrutinizing people who
- for a
tremendously broad set of reasons - have been flagged in Main Core as
potential domestic threats. Some of these individuals might receive a letter
or a phone call, others a request to register with local authorities. Still
others might hear a knock on the door and find police or armed soldiers
outside.
In some instances, the authorities might just ask a few questions.
Other suspects might be arrested and escorted to federal holding facilities,
where they could be detained without counsel until the state of emergency is
no longer in effect.
It is, of course, appropriate for any government to plan for the worst.
But
when COG plans are shrouded in extreme secrecy, effectively unregulated by
Congress or the courts, and married to an overreaching surveillance state - as
seems to be the case with Main Core - even sober observers must weigh whether
the protections put in place by the federal government are becoming more
dangerous to America than any outside threat.
Another well-informed source - a former military operative regularly briefed
by members of the intelligence community - says this particular program has
roots going back at least to the 1980s and was set up with help from the
Defense Intelligence Agency.
He has been told that the program utilizes
software that makes predictive judgments of targets' behavior and tracks
their circle of associations with "social network analysis" and artificial
intelligence modeling tools.
"The more data you have on a particular target, the better [the software]
can predict what the target will do, where the target will go, who it will
turn to for help," he says.
"Main Core is the table of contents for all the
illegal information that the U.S. government has [compiled] on specific
targets."
An intelligence expert who has been briefed by high-level contacts
in the Department of Homeland Security confirms that a database of this sort
exists, but adds that,
"it is less a mega-database than a way to search
numerous other agency databases at the same time."
CROWD CONTROL

A host of publicly disclosed programs, sources say, now supply data to
Main
Core. Most notable are the NSA domestic surveillance programs, initiated in
the wake of 9/11, typically referred to in press reports as "warrantless
wiretapping."
In March, a front-page article in the Wall Street Journal shed further light
onto the extraordinarily invasive scope of the NSA efforts: According to the
Journal, the government can now electronically monitor,
"huge volumes of
records of domestic e-mails and Internet searches, as well as bank
transfers, credit card transactions, travel, and telephone records."
Authorities employ "sophisticated software programs" to sift through the
data, searching for "suspicious patterns." In effect, the program is a mass
catalog of the private lives of Americans.
And it's notable that the article
hints at the possibility of programs like Main Core.
"The [NSA] effort also
ties into data from an ad-hoc collection of so-called black programs whose
existence is undisclosed," the Journal reported, quoting unnamed officials.
"Many of the programs in various agencies began years before the 9/11
attacks but have since been given greater reach."
The following information seems to be fair game
for collection without a warrant:
-
the e-mail addresses you send to and
receive from, and the subject lines of those messages
-
the phone numbers you
dial, the numbers that dial in to your line, and the durations of the calls
-
the Internet sites you visit and the keywords in your Web searches
-
the
destinations of the airline tickets you buy
-
the amounts and locations of
your ATM withdrawals
-
the goods and services you purchase on credit
cards
All of this information is archived on government supercomputers and,
according to sources, also fed into the Main Core database.
Main Core also allegedly draws on four smaller databases that, in turn, cull
from federal, state, and local "intelligence" reports; print and broadcast
media; financial records; "commercial databases"; and unidentified "private
sector entities."
Additional information comes from a database known as the
Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, which generates watch lists from
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for use by airlines, law
enforcement, and border posts.
According to the Washington Post, the
Terrorist Identities list has quadrupled in size between 2003 and 2007 to
include about 435,000 names. The FBI's Terrorist Screening Center border
crossing list, which listed 755,000 persons as of fall 2007, grows by
200,000 names a year.
A former NSA officer tells Radar that the
Treasury
Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, using an electronic-funds
transfer surveillance program, also contributes data to Main Core, as does a
Pentagon program that was created in 2002 to monitor antiwar protesters and
environmental activists such as Greenpeace.

If previous
FEMA and FBI lists are any indication, the
Main Core database
includes dissidents and activists of various stripes, political and tax
protesters, lawyers and professors, publishers and journalists, gun owners,
illegal aliens, foreign nationals, and a great many other harmless, average
people.
A veteran CIA intelligence analyst who maintains active high-level
clearances and serves as an advisor to the Department of Defense in the
field of emerging technology tells Radar that during the 2004 hospital room
drama, James Comey expressed concern over how this secret database was being
used "to accumulate otherwise private data on non-targeted U.S. citizens for
use at a future time."
Though not specifically familiar with the name
Main
Core, he adds,
"What was being requested of Comey for legal approval was
exactly what a Main Core story would be."
A source regularly briefed by
people inside the intelligence community adds:
"Comey had discovered that
President Bush had authorized NSA to use a highly classified and
compartmentalized Continuity of Government database on Americans in
computerized searches of its domestic intercepts. [Comey] had concluded that
the use of that 'Main Core' database compromised the legality of the overall
NSA domestic surveillance project."
If Main Core does exist, says Philip Giraldi, a former CIA counterterrorism
officer and an outspoken critic of the agency, the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) is its likely home.
"If a master list is being compiled, it
would have to be in a place where there are no legal issues" - the CIA and FBI
would be restricted by oversight and accountability laws - "so I suspect it is
at DHS, which as far as I know operates with no such restraints."
Giraldi
notes that DHS already maintains a central list of suspected terrorists and
has been freely adding people who pose no reasonable threat to domestic
security.
"It's clear that DHS has the mandate for controlling and owning
master lists. The process is not transparent, and the criteria for getting
on the list are not clear."
Giraldi continues, "I am certain that the
content of such a master list [as Main Core] would not be carefully vetted,
and there would be many names on it for many reasons - quite likely including
the two of us."
UNDER REAGAN
In the 1980s, control of the FBI's "security index" was
reportedly transferred to none other than FEMA

Would Main Core in fact be legal?
According to constitutional scholar Bruce
Fein, who served as associate deputy attorney general under Ronald Reagan,
the question of legality is murky:
"In the event of a national emergency,
the executive branch simply assumes these powers" - the powers to collect
domestic intelligence and draw up detention lists, for example - "if Congress
doesn't explicitly prohibit it. It's really up to Congress to put these
things to rest, and Congress has not done so."
Fein adds that it is
virtually impossible to contest the legality of these kinds of data
collection and spy programs in court,
"when there are no criminal
prosecutions and [there is] no notice to persons on the president's 'enemies
list.' That means if Congress remains invertebrate, the law will be whatever
the president says it is - even in secret. He will be the judge on his own
powers and invariably rule in his own favor."
The veteran CIA intelligence analyst notes
that Comey's suggestion that the offending elements of the program were
dropped could be misleading:
"Bush [may have gone ahead and] signed it as a
National Intelligence Finding anyway."
But even if we never face a national emergency, the mere existence of the
database is a matter of concern.
"The capacity for future use of this
information against the American people is so great as to be virtually
unfathomable," the senior government official says.
In any case, mass watch lists of domestic citizens may do nothing to make us
safer from terrorism. Jeff Jonas, chief scientist at IBM, a world-renowned
expert in data mining, contends that such efforts won't prevent terrorist
conspiracies.
"Because there is so little historical terrorist event data,"
Jonas tells Radar, "there is not enough volume to create precise
predictions."
The overzealous compilation of a domestic watch list is not unique in
postwar American history. In 1950, the FBI, under the notoriously paranoid
J. Edgar Hoover, began to "accumulate the names, identities, and activities"
of suspect American citizens in a rapidly expanding "security index,"
according to declassified documents.
In a letter to the Truman White House,
Hoover stated that in the event of certain emergency situations, suspect
individuals would be held in detention camps overseen by "the National
Military Establishment."
By 1960, a congressional investigation later
revealed, the FBI list of suspicious persons included,
"professors, teachers,
and educators; labor-union organizers and leaders; writers, lecturers,
newsmen, and others in the mass-media field; lawyers, doctors, and
scientists; other potentially influential persons on a local or national
level; [and] individuals who could potentially furnish financial or material
aid" to unnamed "subversive elements."
This same FBI "security index" was
allegedly maintained and updated into the 1980s, when it was reportedly
transferred to the control of none other than FEMA (though the FBI denied
this at the time).
FEMA, however - then known as the Federal Preparedness Agency - already had its
own domestic surveillance system in place, according to a 1975 investigation
by Senator John V. Tunney of California.
Tunney, the son of heavyweight
boxing champion Gene Tunney and the inspiration for Robert Redford's
character in the film The Candidate, found that the agency maintained
electronic dossiers on at least 100,000 Americans that contained information
gleaned from wide-ranging computerized surveillance. The database was
located in the agency's secret underground city at
Mount Weather, near the
town of Bluemont, Virginia.
The senator's findings were confirmed in a 1976
investigation by the Progressive magazine, which found that the Mount
Weather computers,
"can obtain millions of pieces [of] information on the
personal lives of American citizens by tapping the data stored at any of the
96 Federal Relocation Centers" - a reference to other classified facilities.
According to the Progressive, Mount Weather's databases were run,
"without
any set of stated rules or regulations. Its surveillance program remains
secret even from the leaders of the House and the Senate."
JUST IN CASE
The Miami Herald contended that Reagan loyalist Oliver North
had spearheaded the development of a "secret contingency plan"

Ten years later, a new round of government martial law plans came to light.
A report in the Miami Herald contended that Reagan loyalist and Iran-Contra
conspirator Colonel Oliver North had spearheaded the development of a,
"secret contingency plan," - code-named
REX 84
- which called "for suspension of
the Constitution, turning control of the United States over to FEMA, [and
the] appointment of military commanders to run state and local governments."
The North plan also reportedly called for the detention of upwards of
400,000 illegal aliens and an undisclosed number of American citizens in at
least 10 military facilities maintained as potential holding camps.
North's program was so sensitive in nature that when Texas congressman Jack
Brooks attempted to question North about it during the 1987 Iran-Contra
hearings, he was rebuffed even by his fellow legislators.
"I read in Miami
papers and several others that there had been a plan by that same agency
[FEMA] that would suspend the American Constitution," Brooks said. "I was
deeply concerned about that and wondered if that was the area in which he
[North] had worked."
Senator Daniel Inouye, chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Iran, immediately cut off his colleague, saying,
"That question
touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area, so may I request that
you not touch upon that, sir."
Though Brooks pushed for an answer, the line
of questioning was not allowed to proceed.
Wired magazine turned up additional damaging information, revealing in 1993
that North, operating from a secure White House site, allegedly employed a
software database program called
PROMIS (ostensibly as part of the REX 84
plan).
PROMIS, which has a strange and controversial history, was designed
to track individuals - prisoners, for example - by pulling together information
from disparate databases into a single record.
According to Wired,
"Using
the computers in his command center, North tracked dissidents and potential
troublemakers within the United States. Compared to PROMIS, Richard Nixon's
enemies list or Senator Joe McCarthy's blacklist look downright crude."
Sources have suggested to Radar that government databases tracking Americans
today, including Main Core, could still have PROMIS-based legacy code from
the days when North was running his programs.
In the wake of 9/11, domestic surveillance programs of all sorts expanded
dramatically. As one well-placed source in the intelligence community puts
it,
"The gloves seemed to come off."
What is not yet clear is what sort of
still-undisclosed programs may have been authorized by the Bush White House.
Marty Lederman, a high-level official at the Department of Justice under
Clinton, writing on a law blog last year, wondered,
"How extreme were the
programs they implemented [after
9/11]? How egregious was the lawbreaking?"
Congress has tried, and mostly failed, to find out.
HISTORY'S LESSONS
Japanese Americans moved to internment camps in World War
II
In July 2007 and again last August, Representative
Peter DeFazio, a Democrat
from Oregon and a senior member of the House Homeland Security Committee,
sought access to the "classified annexes" of the Bush administration's
Continuity of Government program.
DeFazio's interest was prompted by
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 (also known as
NSPD-51), issued
in May 2007, which reserves for the executive branch the sole authority to
decide what constitutes a national emergency and to determine when the
emergency is over.
DeFazio found this unnerving.
But he and other leaders of the Homeland Security Committee, including
Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, were denied a review of
the Continuity of Government classified annexes. To this day, their calls
for disclosure have been ignored by the White House.
In a press release
issued last August, DeFazio went public with his concerns that the
NSPD-51
Continuity of Government plans are,
"extra-constitutional or
unconstitutional."
Around the same time, he told the Oregonian:
"Maybe the
people who think there's a conspiracy out there are right."
Congress itself has recently widened
the path for both extra-constitutional detentions by the White House and the
domestic use of military force during a national emergency.
The Military
Commissions Act of 2006 effectively suspended habeas corpus and freed up the
executive branch to designate any American citizen an "enemy combatant"
forfeiting all privileges accorded under the Bill of Rights.
The John Warner
National Defense Authorization Act, also passed in 2006, included a
last-minute rider titled,
"Use of the Armed Forces in Major Public
Emergencies," which allowed the deployment of U.S. military units not just
to put down domestic insurrections - as permitted under posse comitatus and
the Insurrection Act of 1807 - but also to deal with a wide range of
calamities, including "natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious public
health emergency, terrorist attack, or incident."
More troubling, in 2002, Congress authorized funding for the
U.S. Northern
Command, or
NORTHCOM, which, according to Washington Post military
intelligence expert William Arkin,
"allows for emergency military operations
in the United States without civilian supervision or control."
"We are at the edge of a cliff and we're about to fall off," says
constitutional lawyer and former Reagan administration official Bruce Fein.
"To a national emergency planner, everybody looks like a danger to
stability. There's no doubt that Congress would have the authority to
denounce all this - for example, to refuse to appropriate money for the
preparation of a list of U.S. citizens to be detained in the event of
martial law. But Congress is the invertebrate branch.
They say, 'We have to
be cautious.' The same old crap you associate with cowards. None of this
will change under a Democratic administration, unless you have exceptional
statesmanship and the courage to stand up and say, 'You know, democracies
accept certain risks that tyrannies do not.'"
CREDIBLE WITNESS
James Comey

As of this writing, DeFazio, Thompson, and the other 433 members of the
House are debating the so-called Protect America Act, after a similar bill
passed in the Senate.
Despite its name, the act offers no protection for
U.S. citizens; instead, it would immunize from litigation U.S. telecom
giants for colluding with the government in the surveillance of Americans to
feed the hungry maw of databases like Main Core.
The Protect America Act
would legalize programs that appear to be unconstitutional.
Meanwhile, the mystery of James Comey's testimony has disappeared in the
morass of election year coverage.
None of the leading presidential
candidates have been asked the questions that are so profoundly pertinent to
the future of the country:
-
As president, will you continue aggressive
domestic surveillance programs in the vein of the Bush administration?
-
Will
you release the COG blueprints that Representatives DeFazio and Thompson
were not allowed to read?
-
What does it suggest about the state of the nation
that the U.S. is now ranked by worldwide civil liberties groups as an
"endemic surveillance society," alongside repressive regimes such as China
and Russia?
-
How can a democracy thrive with a massive apparatus of spying
technology deployed against every act of political expression, private or
public?
(Radar put these questions to spokespeople for the
McCain, Obama,
and Clinton campaigns, but at press time had yet to receive any responses.)
These days, it's rare to hear a voice like that of Senator Frank Church, who
in the 1970s led the explosive investigations into U.S. domestic
intelligence crimes that prompted the very reforms now being eroded.
"The
technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the
government could enable it to impose total tyranny," Church pointed out in
1975.
"And there would be no way to fight back, because the most careful
effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how
privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know."
UPDATE
Since this article went to press, several documents have emerged to
suggest the story has longer legs than we thought.
Most troubling among
these is an October 2001 Justice Department memo that detailed the
extra-constitutional powers the U.S. military might invoke during domestic
operations following a terrorist attack.
In the memo, John Yoo, then deputy
assistant attorney general,
"concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no
application to domestic military operations."
(Yoo, as most readers know, is
author of the infamous Torture Memo that, in bizarre fashion, rejiggers the
definition of "legal" torture to allow pretty much anything short of
murder.)
In the October 2001 memo, Yoo refers to a classified DOJ document
titled "Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities
Within the United States."
According to the Associated Press,
"Exactly what
domestic military action was covered by the October memo is unclear. But
federal documents indicate that the memo relates to the National Security
Agency's Terrorist Surveillance Program."
Attorney General John Mukasey last
month refused to clarify before Congress whether the Yoo memo was still in
force.
Meanwhile, congressional sources tell Radar that Congressman Peter DeFazio
has apparently abandoned his effort to get to the bottom of the White House
COG classified annexes.
Penny Dodge, DeFazio's chief of staff, says
otherwise.
"We will be sending a letter requesting a classified briefing
soon," she told Radar this week.
