In todays looming confrontation the ratings
agencies are playing the political role of enforcer as the gatekeepers to
credit, to put pressure on Iceland, Greece and even the United States to
pursue creditor-oriented policies that lead inevitably to financial crises.
These crises in turn force debtor governments to
sell off their assets under distress conditions.
In pursuing this guard-dog
service to the worlds bankers, the ratings agencies are escalating a
political strategy they have long been refined over a generation in the
corrupt arena of local U.S. politics.
Why ratings agencies
public selloffs rather than sound tax policy - The Kucinich Case Study
In 1936, as part of the New Deals reform of Americas financial markets,
regulators forbid banks and institutional money managers to buy securities
deemed speculative by recognized rating manuals.
Insurance companies, pension funds and mutual
funds subject to public regulation are required to take into account the
views of the credit ratings agencies, provided them with a
government-sanctioned monopoly.
These agencies make their money by offering
their opinions (for which they have never been legally liable) as to the
payment prospects of various grades of security, from
AAA (as secure
government debt, the top rating because governments always can print the
money to pay) down to various depths of junk.
Moodys, Standard and Poors and Fitch focus mainly on stocks and on
corporate, state and local bond issues.
They make money twice off the same transaction
when cities and states balance their budgets by spinning off public
enterprises into new corporate entities issuing new bonds and stocks.
This business incentive gives the ratings
agencies an antipathy to governments that finance themselves on a
pay-as-you-go basis (as Adam Smith endorsed) by raising taxes on real estate
and other property, income or sales taxes instead of borrowing to cover
their spending. The effect of this inherent bias is not to give an opinion
about what is economically best for a locality, but rather what makes the
most profit for themselves.
Localities are pressured when their rising debt levels lead to a financial
stringency.
Banks pull back their credit lines, and urge cities and states
to pay down their debts by selling off their most viable public enterprises.
Offering opinions on this practice has become a big business for the ratings
agencies. So it is understandable why their business model opposes policies
- and political candidates - that support the idea of basing public
financing on taxation rather than by borrowing.
This self-interest colors their opinions.
If this seems too cynical an explanation for todays ratings agencies
self-serving views, there are sufficient examples going back over thirty
years to illustrate their unethical behavior. The first and most notorious
case occurred in Cleveland, Ohio, after Dennis Kucinich was elected mayor in
1977.
The ratings agencies had been giving the city
good marks despite the fact that it had been using bond funds improperly for
general operating purposes to covered its budget shortfalls by borrowing,
leaving Cleveland with $14.5 million owed to the banks on open short-term
credit lines.
Cleveland had a potential cash cow in Municipal Light, which its Progressive
Era mayor Tom Johnson had created in 1907 as one of Americas first publicly
owned power utilities.
It provided the electricity to light Clevelands
streets and other public uses, as well as providing power to private users.
Meanwhile, banks and their leading local clients were heavily invested in
Muni Lights privately owned competitor, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company.
Members of the Cleveland Trust sat on CEIs
board and wielded a strong influence on the city council to try and take it
over. In a series of moves that city officials, the U.S. Senate and
regulatory agencies found to be improper (popular usage would say criminal),1
CEI caused a series of disruptions in service and worked with the banks and
ratings agencies to try and force the city to sell it the utility.
Banks for
their part had their eye on financing a public buyout - and hoped to
pressure the city into selling, threatening to pull the plug on its credit
lines if it did not surrender Muni Light.
It was to block this privatization that Mr. Kucinich ran for mayor. To free
the city from being liable to financial pressure from its vested interests -
above all from the banks and private utilities - he sought to put the citys
finances on a sound footing by raising taxes.
This threatened to slow borrowing from the banks
(thereby shrinking the business of ratings agencies as well), while freeing
Cleveland from the pressures that have risen across the United States for
cities to start selling off their public enterprises, especially since the
1980s as tax-cutting politicians have left them deeper in debt.
The banks and ratings agencies told Mayor Kucinich that they would back his
political career and even hinted financing a run for the governorship if he
played ball with them and agreed to sell the electric utility. When he
balked, the banks said that they could not renew credit lines to a city that
was so reluctant to balance its books by privatizing its most profitable
enterprises.
This threat was like a credit-card company
suddenly demanding payment of the full balance from a customer, saying that
if it were not paid, the sheriff would come in and seize property to sell
off (usually on credit extended to customers of the bankers).
The ratings agencies chimed in and threatened to downgrade Clevelands
credit rating if the city did not privatize its utility. The financial
tactic was to offer the carrot of corrupting the mayor politically, while
using the threat of forcing the city into financial crisis and raising its
interest rates. If the economy did not pay higher utility charges as a
result of privatization, it would have to pay higher interest.
But standing on principle, the mayor refused to sell the utility, and voters
elected to keep Muni light public by a 2-to-1 margin in a referendum.
They proceeded to pay down the citys debt by
raising its income-tax rate in order to avoid paying higher rates for
privatized electricity. Their choice was thoroughly in line with Book V of
Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations provides a perspective on how borrowing ends
up with a proliferation of taxes to pay the interest.
This makes the private sector pay higher prices
for its basic needs that Cleveland Mayor Tom Johnson and other Progressive
Era leaders a century ago sought to socialize in order to lower the cost of
living and doing business in the United States.
The bankers alliance with the Clevelands wealthy would-be power monopoly
led it to be the first U.S. city to default since the Great Depression as
the state of Ohio forced it into fiscal receivership in 1979. The banks used
the crisis to make an easy gain in buying up bond anticipation notes that
were sold under distress conditions exacerbated by the ratings agencies.
The banks helped fund Mayor Kucinichs opponent
in the 1979 mayoral race.
But in saving Muni Light he had saved voters hundreds of millions of dollars
that the privatizers would have built into their electric rates to cover
higher interest charges and financial fees, dividends to stockholders, and
exorbitant salaries and stock options. In due course voters came to
recognize Mr. Kucinichs achievement have sent him to Congress since 1997.
As for Mini Lights privately owned rival, the
Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, it achieved notoriety for being
primarily responsible for the northeastern United States power blackout in
2003 that left 50 million people without electricity.
The moral is that the ratings agencies criterion was simply what was best
for the banks, not for the debtor economy issuing the bonds.
They were eager to upgrade Clevelands credit
ratings for doing something injurious - first, borrowing from the banks
rather than covering their budget by raising property and income taxes; and
second, raising the cost of doing business by selling Muni Light. They
threatened to downgrade the city for acting to protect its economic interest
and trying to keep its cost of living and doing business low.
The tactics by banks and credit rating agencies have been successful most
easily in cities and states that have fallen deeply into debt dependency.
The aim is to carve up national assets, by doing
to Washington what they sought to do in Cleveland and other cities over the
past generation. Similar pressure is being exerted on the international
level on Greece and other countries.
Ratings agencies act as political enforcers to
knee-cap economies that refrain from privatization sell-offs to solve debt
problems recognized by the markets before the ratings agencies acknowledge
the bad financial mode that they endorse for self-serving business reasons.
Why ratings agencies
oppose public checks against financial fraud
The danger posed by ratings agencies in pressing the global economy to a
race into debt and privatization recently became even more blatant in their
drive to give more leeway to abusive financial behavior by banks and
underwriters.
Former Congressional staffer Matt Stoller cites
an example provided by Josh Rosner and Gretchen Morgenson in
Reckless
Endangerment regarding their support of creditor rights to engage in
predatory lending and outright fraud.2
On January 12, 2003, the state of Georgia passed
strong anti-fraud laws drafted by consumer advocates.
Four days later, Standard & Poor announced that
if Georgia passed anti-fraud penalties for corrupt mortgage brokers and
lenders, packaging including such debts could not be given AAA ratings.
Because of the states new Fair Lending Act, S&P said that it would no
longer allow mortgage loans originated in Georgia to be placed in mortgage
securities that it rated. Moodys and Fitch soon followed with similar
warnings.
It was a critical blow. S&Ps move meant Georgia lenders would have no
access to the securitization money machine; they would either have to keep
the loans they made on their own books, or sell them one by one to other
institutions. In turn, they made it clear to the public that there would be
fewer mortgages funded, dashing the dream of homeownership.
The message was that only bank loans free of legal threat against dishonest
behavior were deemed legally risk-free for buyers of securities backed by
predatory or fraudulent mortgages. The risk in question was that state
agencies would reduce or even nullify payments being extracted by crooked
real estate brokers, appraisers and bankers.
As Rosner and Morgenson summarize:
Standard & Poors said it was taking action
because the new law created liability for any institution that
participated in a securitization containing a loan that might be
considered predatory.
If a Wall Street firm purchased loans that ran
afoul of the law and placed them in a mortgage pool, the firm could be
liable under the law.
Ditto for investors who bought into the
pools.
Transaction parties in securitizations,
including depositors, issuers and servicers, might all be subject to
penalties for violations under the Georgia Fair Lending Act, S&Ps
press release explained.3
The ratings agencies logic is that bondholders
will not be able to collect if public entities prosecute financial fraud
involved in packaging deceptive mortgage packages and bonds.
It is a basic principle of law that receivers or
other buyers of stolen property must forfeit it, and the asset returned to
the victim. So prosecuting fraud is a threat to the buyer - much as an art
collector who bought a stolen painting must give it back, regardless of how
much money has been paid to the fence or intermediate art dealer.
The
ratings agencies do not want this principle to be followed in the financial
markets.
We have fallen into quite a muddle when ratings agencies take the position
that packaged mortgages can receive AAA ratings only from states that do not
protect consumers and debtors against mortgage fraud and predatory finance.
The logic is that giving courts the right to prosecute fraud threatens the
viability of creditor claims endorses a race to the bottom.
If honesty and viable credit were the objective
of ratings agencies, they would give AAA ratings only to states whose courts
deterred lenders from engaging in the kind of fraud that has ended up
destroying the securitized mortgage binge since September 2008. But
protecting the interests of savers or bank customers - and hence even the
viability of securitized mortgage packages - is not the task with which
ratings agencies are charged.
Masquerading as objective think tanks and research organizations, the
ratings agencies act as lobbyists for banks and underwriters by endorsing a
race to the bottom - into debt, privatization sell-offs and an erosion of
consumer rights and control over fraud.
S&P was aggressively killing mortgage
servicing regulation and rules to prevent fraudulent or predatory
mortgage lending, Stoller concludes.
Naomi Klein wrote about S&P and Moodys
being used by Canadian bankers in the early 1990s to threaten a
downgrade of that country unless unemployment insurance and health care
were slashed.
The basic conundrum is that anything that
interferes with the arbitrary creditor power to make money by trickery,
exploitation and outright fraud threatens the collectability of claims.
The banks and ratings agencies have wielded this
power with such intransigence that they have corrupted the financial system
into junk mortgage lending, junk bonds to finance corporate raiders, and
computerized gambles in casino capitalism.
What then is the logic in giving these agencies
a public monopoly to impose their opinions on behalf of their paying
clients, blackballing policies that the financial sector opposes - rulings
that institutional investors are legally obliged to obey?
Threats to downgrade
the U.S. and other national economies to force pro-financial policies
At the point where claims for payment prove self-destructive, creditors move
to their fallback position.
Plan B is to foreclose, taking possession of the
property of debtors. In the case of public debt, governments are told to
privatize the public domain - with banks creating the credit for their
customers to buy these assets, typically under fire-sale distress conditions
that leave room for capital gains and other financial rake-offs.
In cases where foreclosure and forced sell-offs
are not able to make creditors whole (as when the economy breaks down), Plan
C is for governments simply to bail out the banks, taking bad bank debts and
other obligations onto the public balance sheet for taxpayers to make good
on.
Standard and Poors threat to downgrade of U.S. Treasury
bonds from AAA to
AA+ would exacerbate the problem if it actually discouraged purchasers from
buying these bonds.
But on the Monday on August 8, following their Friday
evening downgrade, Treasury borrowing rates fell, with short-term T-bills
actually in negative territory.
That meant that investors had to lose a small
margin simply to keep their money safe. So S&Ps opinions are as ineffectual
as being a useful guide to markets as they are as a guide to promote good
economic policy.
But S&Ps intent was not really to affect the marketability of Treasury
bonds. It was a political stunt to promote the idea that the solution to
todays budget deficit is to pursue economic austerity. The message is that
President Obama should roll back Social Security and Medicare entitlements
so as to free more money for more subsidies, bailouts and tax cuts for the
top of the steepening wealth pyramid. Neoliberal Harvard economics professor
Robert Barro made this point explicitly in a Wall Street Journal
op-ed.
Calling the S&P downgrade a wake-up call to
deal with the budget deficit, he outlined the financial sectors preferred
solution:
A vicious class war against labor to reduce living standards and
further polarize the U.S. economy between creditors and debtors by shifting
taxes off financial speculation and property onto employees and consumers.
-
First, make structural reforms to the
main entitlement programs, starting with increases in ages of
eligibility and a shift to an economically appropriate indexing
formula.
-
Second, lower the structure of marginal
tax rates in the individual income tax.
-
Third, in the spirit of Reagan's 1986
tax reform, pay for the rate cuts by gradually phasing out the main
tax-expenditure items, including preferences for home-mortgage
interest, state and local income taxes, and employee fringe benefits
- not to mention eliminating ethanol subsidies.
-
Fourth, permanently eliminate corporate
and estate taxes, levies that are inefficient and raise little
money.
-
Fifth, introduce a broad-based
expenditure tax, such as a value-added tax (VAT), with a rate around
10%.
Bank lobbyist Anders Aslund of the
Peterson
Institute for International Economics jumped onto the bandwagon by applauding
Latvias economic disaster, a 20 percent plunge in GDP, 30 percent reduction
of public-sector salaries and accelerating emigration as a success story for
other European countries to follow.
As they say, one cant make this up.
As the main advocate and ultimate beneficiary of privatization, the
financial sector directs debtor economies to sell off their public property
and cut social services - while increasing taxes on employees. Populations
living in such economies call them hell and seek to emigrate to find work or
simply to flee their debts.
What else should someone call surging poverty,
death rates and alcoholism while a few grow rich?
The ratings agencies today are like
the IMF in
the 1970s and 80s. Countries that do not agree sell off their public domain
(and give tax deductibility to the interest payments of buyers-on-credit,
providing multinationals with income-tax exemption on their takings from the
monopolies being privatized) are treated as outlaws and isolated Cuba- or
Iran-style.
Such austerity plans are a failed economic model, but the financial sector
has managed to gain even as economies are carved up. Their Plan B is
foreclosure, extending to the national scale. By the 1980s, creditor-planned
economies in Third World debtor countries had reached the limit of their
credit-worthiness.
Under
World Bank coordination, a vast market in
national infrastructure spending for creditor-nation bank debt, bonds and
exports. The projects being financed on credit were mainly to facilitate
exports and provide electric power for foreign investments.
After Mexico announced its insolvency in 1982
when it no longer could afford to service foreign-currency debt, where were
creditors to turn?
Their solution was to use the debt crisis as a lever to start financing
these same infrastructure projects all over again, now that most were
largely paid for. This time, what was being financed was not new
construction, but private-sector buyouts of property that had been financed
by the World Bank and its allied consortia of international bankers.
There is talk of the U.S. Government selling off
its national parks and other real estate, national highways and
infrastructure, perhaps the oil reserve, postal service and so forth.
S&Ps opinion was treated seriously enough by John Kerry, the 2004
Democratic Presidential nominee, as a warning that America should get its
house in order.
Despite the fact that on page 4 of its 8-page
explanation of why it downgraded Treasury bonds, S&Ps stated:
We have changed our assumption on this
because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any
measure that would raise revenues, a position we believe Congress
reinforced by passing the act, was one of the three senators appointed
to the commission under the debt-ceiling agreement.
He chimed in to endorse the S&P action as a
helpful nudge for the country to deal with its entitlements program - as
if Social Security and FICA withholding were a kind of welfare, not actual
savings put in by labor, to be wiped out as the government empties its
coffers to bail out Wall Streets high rollers.
No less a financial publication than the Wall Street Journal has come to the
conclusion that,
in a perfect world, S&P wouldn't exist. And
neither would its rivals Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings
Ltd. At least not in their current roles as global judges and juries of
corporate and government bonds.
As its financial editor Francesco Guerrera wrote
quite eloquently in the aftermath of S&Ps bold threat to downgrade the U.S.
Treasurys credit rating:
The historic decision taken by S&P on Aug.
5 is the culmination of 75 years of policy mistakes that ended up
delegating a key regulatory function to three for-profit entities.

The behavior of leading banks and ratings
agencies Cleveland and other similar cases - of promising to give good
ratings to states, counties and cities that agree to pay off short-term bank
debt by selling off their crown jewels - is not ostensibly criminal under
the law (except when their hit men actually succeed in assassination).
But the ratings agencies have made an compact
with crooks to endorse only public borrowers that agree to pursue such
policies and not to prosecute financial fraud.
To acquiescence in such economically destructive financial behavior is the
opposite of fiscal responsibility.
Cutting federal taxes and Social Security
payments to obtain a more positive S&P opinion would give banks an ability
to pull the plug and force privatization and anti-labor austerity plans by
refraining from rolling over the U.S. debt - and cutting taxes Tea-Party
style rather than funding spending by taxation on a pay-as-you-go-basis.
The present meltdown of the euro provides an object lesson for why
policy-making never should be left to central bankers, because their
mentality is pro-creditor.
Otherwise they would not have the political
reliability demanded by the financial sector that has captured the central
bank, Treasury and regulatory agencies to gain veto power over who is
appointed. Given their preference for debt deflation of the real economy -
while trying to inflate asset prices by promoting the banks product (debt
creation) - central bank and Treasury solutions tend to aggravate economic
downturns.
This is self-destructive because todays major
problem blocking recovery is over-indebtedness.
