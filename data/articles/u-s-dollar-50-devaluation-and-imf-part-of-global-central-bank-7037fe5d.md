A year ago, said law professor Ross
Buckley on Australias ABC News on September 22, nobody wanted to know
the International Monetary Fund. Now its the organizer for the
international stimulus package which has been sold as a stimulus package
for poor countries.
The IMF may have catapulted to a more exalted
status than that.
According to Jim Rickards, director of
market intelligence for scientific consulting firm Omnis, the unannounced
purpose of the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh on September 24 was that,
the IMF is being anointed as the global
central bank.
Rickards said in a CNBC interview on September
25 that the plan is for the IMF to issue a global reserve currency that can
replace the dollar.
Theyve issued debt for the first time in
history, said Rickards.
Theyre issuing SDRs. The last SDRs came
out around 1980 or 81, $30 billion. Now theyre issuing $300 billion.
When I say issuing, its printing money; theres nothing behind these
SDRs.
SDRs, or Special Drawing Rights, are a synthetic
currency originally created by the IMF to replace gold and silver in large
international transactions.
But they have been little used until now. Why
does the world suddenly need a new global fiat currency and global central
bank?
Rickards says it because of the Triffin Dilemma,
a problem first noted by economist Robert Triffin in the 1960s. When
the world went off the gold standard, a reserve currency had to be provided
by some large-currency country to service global trade.
But leaving its currency out there for
international purposes meant that the country would have to continually buy
more than it sold, running large deficits until it eventually went broke.
The U.S. has fueled the world economy for the
last 50 years, but now it is going broke. The U.S. can settle its debts and
get its own house in order, but that would cause world trade to contract. A
substitute global reserve currency is needed to fuel the global economy
while the U.S. solves its debt problems, and that new currency is to be the
IMFs SDRs.
Thats the solution to Triffins dilemma, says Rickards, but it leaves the
U.S. in a vulnerable position.
If we face a war or other global catastrophe, we
no longer have the privilege of printing money. We will have to borrow the
global reserve currency like everyone else, putting us at the mercy of
global lenders.
To avoid that,
the Federal Reserve has hinted that it is prepared to raise
interest rates, even though that would further squeeze the real economy. Rickards pointed to an oped piece by
FED governor Kevin Warsh,
published in The Wall Street Journal on the same day the G20 met.
Warsh said the FED would need to raise interest
rates if asset prices rose - which Rickards interpreted to mean gold, the
traditional go-to investment of investors fleeing the dollar.
Central banks hate gold because it limits
their ability to print money, said Rickards.
If gold were to suddenly go to $1,500 an ounce,
it would mean the dollar was collapsing.
Warsh was giving the market a heads up that the
FED wasnt going to let that happen. The FED would raise interest rates to
attract dollars back into the country.
As Rickards put it,
Warsh is saying, We sort of have to trash
the dollar, but were going to do it gradually... Warsh is trying to
preempt an unstable decline in the dollar. What they want, of course, is
a stable, steady decline.
What about the FEDs traditional role of
maintaining price stability?
Its nonsense, said Rickards.
What they do is inflate the dollar to prop
up the banks.
The dollar has to be inflated because there is
more debt outstanding than money to pay it with.
The government currently
has contingent liabilities of $60 trillion.
Theres no feasible combination of growth
and taxes that can fund that liability, Rickards said.
The government could fund about half that in the
next 14 years, which means the dollar needs to be devalued by half.
The Dollar Needs to be
Devalued by Half?
Reducing the value of the dollar means that our hard-earned dollars are
going to go only half as far, which is not a good thing for Main Street.
In fact, the move is designed not to serve us
but the banks. The dollar needs to be devalued to compensate for a dilemma
in the current monetary scheme that is even more intractable than Triffins,
one that might be called a fraud.
There is never enough money to cover the
outstanding debt, because all money today except coins is created by banks
in the form of loans, and more money is always owed back to the banks than
they advance when they create their loans. Banks create the principal but
not the interest necessary to pay their loans back.
The FED,
which is owned by a consortium of banks and was set up to serve
their interests, is tasked with seeing that the banks are paid back; and the
only way to do that is to inflate the money supply, in order to create the
dollars to cover the missing interest.
But that means diluting the value of the dollar,
which imposes a stealth tax on the citizenry; and the money supply is
inflated by making more loans, which adds to the debt and interest burden
the inflated money supply was supposed to relieve.
The banking system is basically a pyramid
scheme, which can be kept going only by continually creating more debt.
The IMFs $500 Billion
Stimulus Package: Designed to Help Developing Countries or the Banks?
And that brings us back to the IMFs stimulus package discussed by Professor
Buckley. It was billed as helping emerging nations hard
hit by the global credit crisis, but Buckley doubts that is what is really
going on.
Rather, he says, the $500 billion pledged by the G20 nations is,
a
stimulus package for the rich countries banks.
He notes that stimulus
packages are usually grants.
The money coming from the IMF will be extended
in the form of loans.
These are loans that are made by the G20
countries through the IMF to poor countries. They have to be repaid and
what theyre going to be used for is to repay the international banks
now...
[T]he money wont really touch down in the
poor countries. It will go straight through them to repay their
creditors... But the poor countries will spend the next 30 years
repaying the IMF.
Basically, said Professor Buckley, the loans
extended by the IMF represent an increase in seniority of the debt.
That means developing nations will be even more
firmly locked in debt than they are now.
At the moment the debt is owed by poor
countries to banks, and if the poor countries had to, they could default
on that. The bank debt is going to be replaced by debt thats owed to
the IMF, which for very good strategic reasons the poor countries will
always service...
The rich countries have made this $500
billion available to stimulate their own banks, and the IMF is a
wonderful party to put in between the countries and the debtors and the
banks.
Not long ago, the IMF was being called obsolete.
Now it is back in business with a vengeance; but
its the old unseemly business of serving as the collection agency for the
international banking industry.
As long as third world debtors can service
their loans by paying the interest on them, the banks can count the loans as
assets on their books, allowing them to keep their
pyramid scheme going by
inflating the global money supply with yet more loans.
It is all for the greater good of the banks and
their affiliated multinational corporations; but the $500 billion in funding
is coming from the taxpayers of the G20 nations, and the foreseeable outcome
will be that the United States will join the ranks of debtor nations
subservient to a global empire of central bankers.
