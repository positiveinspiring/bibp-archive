# TPP Negotiations Stalled by Significant Gaps

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_tpp06.htm

At a press conference held last week at the
end of the most recent round of negotiations on the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP), trade reps from the 12 member countries report that
despite their best efforts to rush to reach an agreement, "significant
gaps" in the details remain.
Not only are the negotiators finding it hard
to mesh the trade standards of 12 disparate economies and cultures, but
the impasse is so significant that no schedule was set for future
meetings.
While this is good news for those of us
committed to keeping the United States free from these sovereignty
transfers posing as trade pacts, we're not out of the woods yet.
At the press conference, U.S. Trade
Representative Michael Froman (above image) said,
"Our focus is on achieving an agreement
among all 12 of us and that agreement needs to be that ambitious,
comprehensive, high-standard agreement."
A significant part of Froman's (and
President
Obama's) plan to foist this latest scheme on the American
people is the obtaining of "fast track trade authority" from Congress.
Happily,
the globalists seem to be stymied here, as well.
The Washington Post reported
February 19 on the
pressure the president is feeling from his own party to pump the
brakes on the TPP and fast track authority:
Already, Senate Majority Leader Harry M.
Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) are
opposed to moving forward with granting Obama fast-track authority.
"Everyone would be well-advised just to
not push this right now," Reid said late last month.
He's generally opposed to large global trade
agreements.
Pelosi doesn't oppose the concept of
fast-track, but said last week that she is against a bipartisan measure
introduced by Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and
Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.) that would give Obama the authority.
Resistance from Reid and Pelosi usually
would be enough to at least ease the White House push. But Obama and
Vice President Biden have also been directly confronted on the issue in
recent weeks by rank-and-file members.
But 151 House Democrats co-signed a letter
late last year written by Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) to voice
opposition to fast track authority and the TPP - more than half of the
caucus.
And during a recent closed-door meeting at
the White House, Obama took two questions on the subject, while Biden
faced a grilling on the subject at the House Democratic policy retreat
last week.
What's the point, then? Why is the president
and his trade reps so insistent on getting the TPP passed by hook or by
crook, particularly in light of the political poison pill it seems to
be?
As with the multitude of similar trade pacts
the United States has formed, the ultimate aim of the TPP is the
creation of a regional super government, thus the stonewalling of
federal lawmakers who dare seek to assert some sort of oversight.
In the case of the TPP, the zone would be
called the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).
Members of the
proposed "free trade" bloc include all the current TPP participants:
-
Malaysia
-
Singapore
-
Japan
-
Vietnam
-
Brunei
-
Australia
-
New Zealand
-
Peru
-
Mexico
-
Chile
-
Canada
-
the United States
The regional trading partnership is intended
to establish,
"a comprehensive free trade agreement
across the region."
An article in the Georgetown Journal of
International Law says that the TPP negotiations,
"are designed to culminate in a 'gold
standard' free trade agreement (FTA)."
In fact, the authors of the Georgetown
review state that the ultimate goal of the TPP isn't just the creation
of an FTAAP.
They insist that the TPP is a,
"trade agreement designed to achieve
broad liberalization and a high degree of economic integration among
the parties."
There's that word "integration" again.
Integration is a word that is painful to the
ears of constitutionalists and those unwilling to surrender U.S.
sovereignty to a committee of globalists who are unelected by the
American people and unaccountable to them.
Integration is an
internationalist tool for subordinating American law to the globalist
bureaucracy at the United Nations.
Economic and political integration will push
the once-independent United States of America into yet another
collectivist bloc that will facilitate the complete dissolution of our
nation and our states into no more than impotent members of
a one-world
government.
In an article examining the devastating
effects of the TPP, William F. Jasper of The New American
identified the end game for these globalists and
their secretly planned trade pacts (see "Regional Scheme for the Pacific
Rim" on page 39 of "How the Free Trade Agenda Is
Knocking Down America").
Wrote Jasper:
The architects and promoters of the TPP and
FTAAP frequently point with admiration to the "integration" process of
the European Union (EU) as the model they would like to see implemented
for the Asia-Pacific rim nations.
As with the Transatlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership (TTIP), the Trans-Pacific Partnership has been
designed to follow the EU example of relentless widening and deepening,
constantly eroding national sovereignty, while building "transnational
governance" that is not restrained by the checks and balances of
national constitutions.
Equally significant is that 600 industry
lobbyists and "advisors," as well as unelected trade representatives,
are at the table, while representatives from the public at large and
businesses other than huge monopolies are conspicuously absent.
Each of the "partners" to the pact,
including foreign corporations, would be exempted from abiding by
American laws governing trade disputes.
Moreover, the sovereignty of the United
States and the Constitution's enumeration of powers would once again be
sacrificed on the altar of global government by subordinating U.S. laws
passed by duly elected representatives of the people to a code of
regulations created by a team of transnational bureaucrats.
Americans who study the subject realize that
the domestic legal processes being carried out in secret by the
globalists sitting around the TPP negotiating table is an attack on,
The situation is dire indeed.
In a recent
video presentation (below), William F. Jasper makes a compelling case for his
claim that the TPP is "more
dangerous than ObamaCare":
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
Bigger and More Dangerous Than ObamaCare
ObamaCare and the TPP have something else in
common, besides the threat they pose to our sovereignty and the
principle of enumerated powers.
Regardless of presidential fervor for the
surrender of sovereignty to globalists or the forcing of Americans to
purchase commodities, no treaty or "law" that violates the Constitution
could ever become the law of the land.
When it comes to trade agreements or any act
passed by Congress, the analysis must begin by looking within the four
corners of the Constitution.
It only makes sense that the federal
government cannot enter into a treaty that would contravene the
Constitution. If I tell my teenage son that he can drive my car to the
movies, does that give him permission to drive it into a lake?
To put a finer point on it, Article VI of
the Constitution says:
This Constitution, and the laws of the
United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties
made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States,
shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state
shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any
State to the contrary notwithstanding.
That means that in order to have any lawful
effect, the object of any treaty signed by the president and ratified by
the Senate must lay within their constitutional authority ("the
authority of the United States").
In the case of the TPP and ObamaCare, there
is no doubt that many of their key provisions directly violate the
Constitution in myriad ways.
If the Congress and president were to
disregard these restrictions on their power as they so often do, the
mandates of the resulting treaty would not be the law of land, as
Alexander Hamilton explained in The Federalist, No. 33:
If a number of political societies enter
into a larger political society, the laws which the latter may enact,
pursuant to the powers intrusted [sic] to it by its constitution, must
necessarily be supreme over those societies and the individuals of whom
they are composed...
But it will not follow from this doctrine
that acts of the larger society which are not pursuant to its
constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary
authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of the
land.
These will be merely acts of usurpation, and
will deserve to be treated as such.
Thomas Jefferson echoed that point
specifically as it pertains to the topic of treaties.
Jefferson wrote,
"In giving to the President and Senate a
power to make treaties, the Constitution meant only to authorize
them to carry into effect, by way of treaty, any powers they might
constitutionally exercise."
At another time, he reiterated this
principle of constitutional construction, saying,
"Surely the President and Senate cannot
do by treaty what the whole government is interdicted from doing in
any way."
In a letter to his colleague, collaborator,
and friend James Madison, Jefferson agreed that,
"the objects on which the President and
Senate may exclusively act by treaty are much reduced" by
application of the principle that a treaty cannot contradict the
Constitution and yet still enjoy the approval of that document.
Again, my son couldn't justify crashing my
car into a lake by pointing to my permission to drive it to the movies.
Despite these sound principles of the rule
of law and constitutional supremacy and the roadblocks to ratification
of the TPP, a word of caution is necessary.
Although in reality, as proved above,
treaties and acts that violate the Constitution are prima facie null,
void, of no legal effect, the Supreme Court has come down on both sides
of the supremacy issue, and despite not having that authority, the
Supreme Court has failed to protect the Constitution in many recent
opportunities.
