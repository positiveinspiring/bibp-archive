Using images from Arab TV, rarely seen in the
West, Obsession reveals an insider's view' of the hatred the Radicals are
teaching, their incitement of global jihad, and their goal of world
domination.
With the help of experts, including first-hand
accounts from a former PLO terrorist, a Nazi youth commander, and the
daughter of a martyred guerilla leader, the film shows, clearly, that the
threat is real.
A peaceful religion is being hijacked by a dangerous foe,
who seeks to destroy the shared values we stand for.
The world should be very concerned.
