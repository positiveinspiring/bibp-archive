Does publishing a hyperlink to freely available
content amount to an illegal communication to the public and therefore a
breach of creator's copyrights under European law?
After examining a case
referred to it by Sweden's Court of Appeal, the Court of Justice of the
European Union has ruled today that no, it does not.
The European Union has been expanding since its
creation in the 1950s and is now comprised of 28 member states, each
committed to EU law.
One of the key roles of the
EUs Court of Justice is to examine and interpret EU legislation to
ensure its uniform application across all of those member states. The Court
is also called upon by national courts to clarify finer points of EU law to
progress local cases with Europe-wide implications.
One such case, referred to the CJEU by Swedens
Court of Appeal, is of particular interest to Internet users as it concerns
the very mechanism that holds the web together.
The dispute centers on a company called
Retriever Sverige AB, an Internet-based subscription service that indexes
links to articles that can be found elsewhere online for free.
The problem came when Retriever published links
to articles published on a newspapers website that were written by Swedish
journalists. The company felt that it did not have to compensate the
journalists for simply linking to their articles, nor did it believe that
embedding them within its site amounted to copyright infringement.
The journalists, on the other hand, felt that by
linking to their articles Retriever had "communicated" their works to the
public without permission.
In the belief they should be paid, the
journalists took their case to the Stockholm District Court. They lost their
case in 2010 and decided to take the case to appeal. From there the Svea
Court of Appeal sought advice from the EU Court.
Today the Court of Justice published its lengthy
decision and its largely good news for the Internet.
"In the circumstances of this case, it must
be observed that making available the works concerned by means of a
clickable link, such as that in the main proceedings, does not lead to
the works in question being communicated to a new public," the Court
writes.
"The public targeted by the initial
communication consisted of all potential visitors to the site concerned,
since, given that access to the works on that site was not subject to
any restrictive measures, all Internet users could therefore have free
access to them," it adds.
"Therefore, since there is no new public,
the authorization of the copyright holders is not required for a
communication to the public such as that in the main proceedings."
However, the ruling also makes it clear that
while publishing a link to freely available content does not amount to
infringement, there are circumstances where that would not be the case.
"Where a clickable link makes it possible
for users of the site on which that link appears to circumvent
restrictions put in place by the site on which the protected work
appears in order to restrict public access to that work to the latter
sites subscribers only, and the link accordingly constitutes an
intervention without which those users would not be able to access the
works transmitted, all those users must be deemed to be a new public,"
the Court writes.
So, in basic laymans terms, if content is
already freely available after being legally published and isnt already
subject to restrictions such as a subscription or pay wall, linking to or
embedding that content does not communicate it to a new audience and is
therefore not a breach of EU law.
The decision, which concurs with
the opinions of a panel of scholars, appears to be good news for anyone
who wants to embed a YouTube video in their blog or Facebook page, but bad
news for
certain collecting societies who feel that embedding should result in
the payment of a licensing fee.
