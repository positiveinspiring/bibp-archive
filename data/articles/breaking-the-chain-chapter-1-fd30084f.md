Chapter One
An overview of the Illuminati
In order to understand Illuminati cult programming, it is first
necessary to understand a bit about the structure and philosophy of
the organization. The Illuminati are a group of people who follow a
philosophy known as "Illuminism" or "enlightenment".
The Illuminati were named several hundred years ago, but trace their
roots and history to the ancient mystery religions of Egypt, ancient
Babylon, and even Mesopotamia. Out of these ancient religions, which
were practiced secretly over hundreds and hundreds of years, there arose
esoteric groups which continued to practice the rites, traditions, and
enculturation brought in from the original groups.
Over the centuries, these groups practiced openly in some countries,
and covertly in countries where Christianity or other
religions opposed their practices. Some of the groups which came out
of these ancient roots included the order of the Knights Templar, Rosicrucian's,
Baphetomism, and Druidic cults. These groups were the forerunners, or
roots, of modern day Illuminism. The original Illuministic leaders chose
to take what they felt were the best practices of each root religion,
combine them into principles, then organized these principles according
to specific guidelines.
Modern day Illuminism is a philosophy funded by the wealthy, but practiced
in all social strata. It is a philosophy whose tenets have spread across
the world. It started with the German branch of Rosicrucian's, spread
to England, then came to the United states with the first settlers.
The Illuminati have 3 main branches: the Germanic branch, which
oversees the others, the British branch, which handles finances, and
the French/Russian branch. All 3 branches are represented in both the
United States and Canada, as well as every country in the world.
How the Illuminati are organized in the United States: The Illuminati
have groups in every major city of the United States. They originally
entered the U.S. through Pittsburgh, Pa., and from there, spread across
the US. There are 18 cities across the US, which are considered major
"power centers" for Illuminati power and/or influence. These
include: Washington, DC and the surrounding areas; Albany, New York;
Pittsburgh, Pa; the "golden triangle" of the Winston Salem,
Raleigh, NC area; Minneapolis, Minn; Ann Arbor, Mich; Wichita, Kan.;
Phoenix, Az.; Portland, Or.; Flagstaff, Az.; Seattle, Wash.; Houston,
TX; Los Angeles, CA. and surrounding areas; Atlanta, Ga.; New Orleans,
La., Springfield, Miss. Other cities are important to the Illuminati,
as well, but these cities funnel money for them, conduct research, and
often regional councils sit within them.
Hierarchy of the Illuminati
The Illuminati have organized their society along extremely hierarchical,
or stratified, levels. In fact, the top levels are known as:
Hierarchical level
The Illuminati have divided the United States into 7 geographical regions;
each region has its own regional council, composed of 13 members, with
an advisory board of 3 elders to each one. These regions interact for
purposes of finances; personnel; teaching, etc. Beneath each regional
council, is a local council. This is a council of 13 members, the head
of whom sits on the regional council, and gives it information about
the local groups underneath his leadership. The local council will also
have an advisory council of 3.
A local leadership council in a large metropolitan area might look
like this:
Head of local council (reports to regional council)
Two intermediaries (report all activities under leader to him)
Four administrators (oversee finances, administer, set up group
activities)
Six head trainers (over trainers in local groups, teach other
trainers)
Underneath the above leadership council, will be six people designated
as informers or intermediaries, who go to the local group meetings,
interact with local group leaders, and report to the leadership council.
Anarchical level: the levels below the leadership council are known
as the anarchical levels.
Underneath the intermediate level, is the local group level. It will
look like this:
Local "Sister groups" (will vary in number, according
to the size of the city, or cities, in the area). A large metropolitan
area may have anywhere from ten to twenty seven groups.
Each sister group will be headed up by:
A high priest and priestess: this job is rotated every 3 years, to
allow different people within the group to take on leadership roles.
Each group will also have different members, with specific roles/jobs
within the group. These roles will be addressed in chapter 2.
One thing that I would like to emphasize is the fact that the Illuminati
today are generational. There members are born into the group, which
is highly organized, as described above. The set up discussed above
is representative, with minor variations, of most major metropolitan
regions of the United States. Smaller population centers will be organized
under similar guidelines, but will be umbrellaed together with several
cities within the region to create the local leadership council.
HOW THE ILLUMINATI MAKE MONEY
The Illuminati are involved in many areas of making money, as they
need continued financing to survive. There are several illegal enterprises
that they are involved in, as well as legal ones.
Drug running: The Illuminati linked up with the Mafia and the
Columbians, years ago, to help each other out with bringing drugs into
the United States. They also provide couriers for taking drugs and money
out of the States. The Illuminists are generally wealthy businessmen,
who have 4 layers of people underneath them. The fourth layer down actually
has contact with the people in the drug industry. They never identify
themselves as Illuminists; only as people interested in investing, with
a guaranteed profit, and are highly secretive. In return, the local
groups supply people willing to be couriers of money or drugs, or people
willing to help cover for the local operations.
Pornography: The Illuminati are linked in many cities with pornography/prostitution/child
prostitution/ and white slavery sales. Again, several layers are present,
as a buffer, between the true "management" and those either
engaged in the activities, or in paying for/funding and eventually being
paid for the activities.
Children are often supplied from the local cult groups, and taught
to be child prostitutes (and later, adult prostitutes); are photographed
and filmed in every type of pornography available, including "snuff
films" and violent films.
Gun running: The Illuminati and other groups are also involved
in international gun sales and shipments. The Illuminists have well
trained couriers who will cross international and state lines. These
couriers are highly secretive, and will not reveal their sources, on
pain of suicide or assassination. These people are accountable to others
above them, with two more "buffer layers" of people above
these, before the person in the Illuminati with money, who helps fund
this, is found.
Buying access codes for military computers: The Illuminati will
have people from all strata of civilian life trained to go and make
pickups near or on military bases. A typical person used might be the
innocent looking wife of a military person, a local businessman, or
even a college student. There is a contact inside the base, also a dissociative
Illuminist, who brings the information to the outside contact. Occasionally,
the contact person is paid with money, information, or goods. The military
computer codes are changed on random schedules; the Illuminati have
at least 5 or 6 contacts on each major base, who alert them when the
codes are getting ready to change, on pain of death. The Illuminists
like having access to military computers, because that will gain them
entrance to closed files the world over.
Hiring and selling assassinations: this is done worldwide, more
in Europe than in the States. These people are paid big money to do
either a private or political assassination. The money is paid either
to the assassin, or to the trainer; usually they both divide the fee
The assassin is offered protection in another country for awhile, until
the trail runs cold. If the kill is done in Europe they may be sent
to the far east or the U.S., and vice versa if the kill is done in the
U.S. The Illuminati have a wide arena of places and false identities
to hide these people, unless for some reason they want the assassin
disposed of as well. Then, he/she is caught and immediately executed.
Mercenaries/military trainers: guess who gets paid money to
come in and train paramilitary groups? Who has training camps all over
the states of Montana, Nevada, and North Dakota? Who occasionally will
offer their expertise in return for a large financial reward? They never
advertise themselves as Illuminati, unless the group is known to be
sympathetic to their cause. Instead, these are tough, cold, brutal military
trainers, who offer to teach these groups in return for money, or even
better, a promise to affiliate with their group in return (loyalty in
return for knowledge). More and more paramilitary groups have been brought
into the Illuminati this way, without their full knowledge of who and
what the group really is. This gives the Illuminists a way to monitor
these groups (their trainers report on them, and their activities),
and it can be useful to have trained military groups that they can call
on someday.
Banking: The original Illuminists were bankers, and they have
highly trained financiers to organize their money, and funnel the above
illicit funds into more "respectable" front groups/organizations.
They will also start benevolent charities, community organizations,
etc., as fronts, and funnel the money from a broad base into these groups.
The Illuminati particularly pride themselves on their money making and
manipulation skills, and their ability to cover their paper trails expertly,
through layer after layer.
All banking trails eventually will lead to Belgium, the Illuminati
financial center for the world. These are some of the major money making
enterprises that the Illuminati are engaged in. They have a lot of financial
resources, backing their enterprises, which means that in reality they
can engage the best lawyers, accountants, etc. to help cover their trail
as well.
