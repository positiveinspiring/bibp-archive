We now stand at the edge of the
global financial abyss of a Great Global
Debt Depression, where nations, mired in extreme debt, are beginning to
implement fiscal austerity measures to reduce their deficits, which will
ultimately result in systematic global social genocide, as the middle
classes vanish and the social foundations upon which our nations rest are
swept away.
How did we get here? Who brought us here? Where is this road
leading?
These are questions I will briefly attempt to answer.
At the heart of the global political economy is the central banking system.
Central banks are responsible for printing a nations currency and setting
interest rates, thus determining the value of the currency. This should no
doubt be the prerogative of a national government, however, central banks
are of a particularly deceptive nature, in which while being imbued with
governmental authority, they are in fact privately owned by the worlds
major global banks, and are thus profit-seeking institutions.
How do central
banks make a profit? The answer is simple: how do all banks make a profit?
Interest on debt.
Loans are made, interest rates are set, and profits are
made. It is a system of debt, imperial economics at its finest.
In the United States, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve
Act in 1913, creating the
Federal Reserve System, with the Board located in
Washington, appointed by the President, but where true power rested in the
12 regional banks, most notably among them, the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.
The regional Fed banks were private banks, owned in shares by the
major banks in each region, which elected the board members to represent
them, and who would then share power with the Federal Reserve Board in
Washington.
In the early 1920s, the
Council on Foreign Relations was formed in the
United States as the premier foreign policy think tank, dominated by
powerful banking interests. In 1930, the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS) was created to manage German reparations payments, but it also had
another role, which was much less known, but much more significant. It was
to act as a coordinator of the operations of central banks around the
world.
Essentially, it is the central bank for the worlds central banks,
whose operations are kept strictly confidential.
As historian Carroll
Quigley wrote:
"The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing
less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands
able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the
world as a whole.
This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by
the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements
arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.
The apex of the
system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel,
Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds central
banks which were themselves private corporations."
In 1954,
the Bilderberg Group was formed as a secretive global think tank,
comprising intellectual, financial, corporate, political, military and media
elites from Western Europe and North America, with prominent bankers such as
David Rockefeller, as well as
European royalty, such as the Dutch royal
family, who are the largest shareholders in Royal Dutch Shell, whose CEO
attends every meeting.
This group of roughly 130 elites meets every year in
secret to discuss and debate global affairs, and to set general goals and
undertake broad agendas at various meetings. The group was initially formed
to promote European integration. The 1956 meeting discussed European
integration and a common currency.
In fact, the current Chairman of the Bilderberg Group told European media last year that the
Euro was debated at
the Bilderberg Group.
In 1973, David Rockefeller, Chairman and CEO of Chase Manhattan Bank,
Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations and a member of the Steering
Committee of the Bilderberg Group, formed the Trilateral Commission with CFR
academic
Zbigniew Brzezinski.
That same year, the oil price shocks created a
wealth of oil money, which was discussed at that years Bilderberg meeting 5
months prior to the oil shocks, and the money was funneled through western
banks, which loaned it to third world nations desperately in need of loans
to finance industrialization.
When Jimmy Carter became President in 1977, he appointed over two dozen
members of the Trilateral Commission into his cabinet, including himself,
and of course, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was his National Security Adviser.
In 1979, Carter appointed David Rockefellers former aide and friend,
Paul Volcker, who had held various positions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York and the U.S. Treasury Department, and who also happened to be a member
of
the Trilateral Commission, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
When
another oil shock took place in 1979, Volcker decided to raise interest
rates from 2% in the late 70s, to 18% in the early 80s.
The effect this had
was that the countries of the developing world suddenly had to pay enormous
interest on their loans, and in 1982, Mexico announced it could no longer
afford to pay its interest, and it defaulted on its debt, which set off the
1980s debt crisis - collapsing nations in debt across Latin America, Africa
and parts of Asia.
It was
the IMF and
the World Bank came to the assistance of the Third
World with their structural adjustment programs, which forced countries
seeking assistance to privatize all state owned industries and resources,
devalue their currencies, liberalize their economies, dismantle health,
education and social services.
Ultimately resulting in the re-colonization
of the Third World as Western corporations and banks bought all their
assets and resources, and ultimately created the conditions of social
genocide, with the spread of mass poverty, and the emergence of corrupt
national elites who were subservient to the interests of Western elites.
The
people in these nations would protest, riot and rebel, and the states would
clamp down with the police and military.
In the West, corporations and banks saw rapid, record-breaking profits. This
was the era in which the term globalization emerged. While profits soared,
wages for people in the West did not. Thus, to consume in an economy in
which prices were rising, people had to go into debt. This is why this era
marked the rise of credit cards fueling consumption, and the middle class
became a class based entirely on debt.
In the 1990s, the new world order was born, with America ruling the global
economy, free trade agreements began integrating regional and global markets
for the benefit of global banks and corporations, and speculation dominated
the economy.
The global economic crisis arose as a result of decades of global
imperialism - known recently as globalization
- and the reckless growth
of speculation, derivatives and an explosion of debt. As the economic
crisis spread, nations of the world, particularly the United States, bailed
out the major banks (which should have been made to fail and crumble under
their own corruption and greed), and now the West has essentially privatized
profits for the banks, and socialized the risk.
In other words, the nations
bought the debt from the banks, and now the people have to pay for it.
The
people, however, are immersed in their own personal debt to such degrees
that today, the average Canadian is $39,000 in debt, and students are
graduating into a jobless market with tens to hundreds of thousands of
dollars of student debt that they will never repay. Hence, we are now faced
with a global debt crisis.
To manage the economic crisis, the G20 was established as the major
international forum for cooperation among the 20 major economies of the
world, including the major developing - or emerging - economies, such as,
-
India
-
Brazil
-
South Africa
-
China
At the onset of the financial crisis,
China and Russias central banks began calling for the establishment of a
global currency to replace the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency. This proposal was backed by the UN and the IMF.
It should be noted, however,
that the Chinese and Russian central banks cooperate with the Western
central banks through the Bank for International Settlements - which the
President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, recently said
was the principle forum for,
governance of central bank cooperation and
that the G20 is the prime group for global economic governance.
In 2009,
the IMF stated that the BIS,
is the central and the oldest focal point for
coordination of global governance arrangements.
The President of the
European Union, appointed to the position after attending a Bilderberg
meeting, declared 2009 as the first year of global governance.
The 2009 Bilderberg meeting reported on the desire to create a global treasury, or
global central bank, to manage the world economy. In 2009, prior to the
Bilderberg meeting in fact, the G20 set in motion plans to make the IMF a
global central bank of sorts, issuing and even printing its own currency - called
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)
- which is valued against a basket of
currencies.
In May of 2010, the IMF Managing Director stated that,
crisis is
an opportunity, and while Special Drawing Rights are a step in the right
direction, ultimately what is needed is a new global currency issued by a
global central bank, with robust governance and institutional features.
Thus, we see the emergence of a process towards the formation of a global
central bank and a global currency, totally unaccountable to any nation or
people, and totally controlled by global banking interests.
In 2010, Greece was plunged into a debt crisis, a crisis which is now
spreading across Europe, to the U.K. and eventually to Japan and the United
States. If we look at Greece, we see the nature of the global debt crisis.
The debt is owed to major European and American banks. To pay the interest
on the debt, Greece had to get a loan from the European Central Bank and the
IMF, which forced the country to impose fiscal austerity measures as a
condition for the loans, pressuring Greece to commit social genocide.
Meanwhile, the major banks of America and Europe speculate against the Greek
debt, further plunging the country into economic and social crisis. The loan
is granted, to pay the interest, yet simply has the effect of adding to the
overall debt, as a new loan is new debt.
Thus, Greece is caught in the same
debt trap that re-colonized the Third World.
At the recent G20 meeting in Toronto, the major nations of the world agreed
to impose fiscal austerity - or in other words, commit social genocide - within their nations, in a veritable global structural adjustment program.
So now we will see the beginnings of the Great Global Debt Depression, in
which major western and global nations cut social spending, create mass
unemployment by dismantling health, education, and social services.
Further,
state infrastructure - such as roads, bridges, airports, ports, railways,
prisons, hospitals, electric transmission lines and water - will be
privatized, so that global corporations and banks will own the entirely of
national assets. Simultaneously, of course, taxes will be raised
dramatically to levels never before seen.
The BIS said that interest rates
should rise at the same time, meaning that interest payments on debt will
dramatically increase at both the national and individual level, forcing
governments to turn to the IMF for loans - likely in the form of its new
global reserve currency - to simply pay the interest, and will thus be
absorbing more debt.
Simultaneously, of course, the middle class will in
effect have its debts called in, and since the middle class exists only as
an illusion, the illusion will vanish.
Already, towns, cities, and states across America are resorting to drastic
actions to reduce their debts, such as closing fire stations, scaling back
trash collection, turning off street lights, ending bus services and public
transportation, cutting back on library hours or closing them altogether,
school districts cutting down the school day, week or year. Simultaneously,
this is occurring with a dramatic increase in the rate of privatizations or
public-private partnerships in which even libraries are being privatized.
No wonder then, that this month, the Managing Director of the IMF warned
that America and Europe, in the midst of the worst jobs crisis since the
Great Depression, face an explosion of social unrest.
Just yesterday,
Europe experienced a wave of mass protests and social unrest in opposition
to austerity measures, with a general strike in Spain involving millions
of people, and a march on the EU headquarters in Brussels of nearly 100,000
people. As social unrest spreads, governments will likely react - as we saw
in the case of the G20 in Toronto - with oppressive police state measures.
Here, we see the true relevance of the emergence of Homeland Security
States, designed not to protect people from terrorists, but to protect the
powerful from the people.
So while things have never seemed quite so bleak, there is a dim and growing
beacon of hope, in what Zbigniew Brzezinski has termed as the greatest
threat to elite interests everywhere - the global political awakening.
The
global political awakening is representative of the fact that for the first
time in all of human history, mankind is politically awakened and stirring,
activated and aware, and that generally - as Zbigniew Brzezinski explains - generally is aware of global inequalities, exploitation, and disrespect.
This awakening is largely the result of the information revolution - thus
revealing the contradictory nature of the globalization project,
as while
it globalizes power and oppression, so too does it globalize awareness and
opposition.
This awakening is the greatest threat to entrenched elite
interests everywhere.
The awakening, while having taken root in the global
south - already long subjected to exploitation and devastation - is now
stirring in the west, and will grow
as the economy crumbles. As the middle
classes realize their consumption was an illusion of wealth, they will seek
answers and demand true change, not the Wall Street packaged brand-name
change of Obama Inc., but true, inspired, and empowering change.
In 1967, Martin Luther King delivered a speech in which he spoke out against
the Vietnam War and the American empire, and he stated that,
It seems as if
we are on the wrong side of a world revolution.
So now it seems to me that
the time has come for that to change.
