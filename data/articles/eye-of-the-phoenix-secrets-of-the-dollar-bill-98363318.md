This high quality documentary proves the
following points about the two Seals on the back of the One Dollar Bill with
clarity and precision:
-
The two Seals are Egyptian and
Luciferian
-
The two Seals were introduced by
Freemasons, in 1782
-
Masonic President Franklin Roosevelt,
aided by his Secretary of Agriculture/Vice President Wallace,
ordered these Seals to be placed on the back of the Dollar Bill in
1935, having been urged on and advised by the Russian channeler/mystic,
Nicolas Roerich
-
Americans had no idea that the Roosevelt
Administration was as controlled by mystic,
Black Magick forces, as
it was. Had they known the degree to which Roosevelt was controlled
by Black Magick forces, he would have been forced out of office
immediately
-
Former Satanist, Doc Marquis, reveals
that, while in the Illuminati, he was taught that the two Seals are
NOT official seals of the United States, but of the Global
Illuminati!
-
Doc Marquis also reveals that these two
Seals hide three (3) hexagrams plus a hidden message about
Freemasonry. These hexagrams form a '666'
-
We correctly link the symbolism of the
All-Seeing Eye of Lucifer hovering over the unfinished pyramid on
the back of the Dollar Bill to the coming prophesied Third Temple on
the Temple Mount in Jerusalem!
The Masons have been steadfastly
determined since 1782 to seize control of the Temple Mount so they
could resurrect Solomon's Temple for use by their Masonic Christ!
Since this was the plan in 1782 when the Seals
were created, the Masons made sure that the symbolism of the unfinished
pyramid directly tied into their plan to rebuild Solomon's Temple.
When the Masonic Christ (Antichrist) is planned
to be the "Living Stone" to top off the unfinished pyramid! You will be
amazed at this simple, but profound, symbolism linkeage and by the thorough
degree to which this plan fulfills Bible prophecy exactly!
You will be shocked to realize that the stage
for the fulfillment of this End of the Age prophecy was set all the way back
to 1782!
Eye of The Phoenix
- Secrets of The Dollar Bill -
A review
from
CosnpiracyCentral Website
The film "Eye of the Phoenix" is nearly 3 hours
long and it was very long.
What do I think of it?
It is one of the greatest documentaries I've
ever seen in my life. It focused not only on the Great Seal, but other
subjects like the Illuminati, the Theosophical Society (whose co-founder was
of course Madame H.P. Blavatsky. She followed the Gnostic lie that the Devil
in the Bible offering Adam the fruit of knowledge was the good guy, while
Jehovah was the bad guy. That is one definition of the creed of Gnosticism),
the Philosopher Stone, and other issues.
The film made known that certain occultists want to create their utopian new
world order (and involved in that goal is the re-establishment of Solomon's
Temple. Freemasonry explicitly wants this goal as quotes exist of this). It
outlined information that I knew about and it presented information that I
didn't knew about.
One of the major parts of the film was about the
Phoenix
bird.
The Phoenix bird in legend would die and burn
plus it would reappear later. In ancient cultures, it represented the false
sun god (even a peacock or a strange feathered bird) or even Lucifer. That
is why
occult Secret Societies to this day outline a worship of
Lucifer (or
Satan). One of the old names for the Phoenix is FENEX in the Greek language,
which equals 666 in the Greek gematria calculation.
The Phoenix was
caused the shining one, which is an old name for Lucifer ironically.
The occult groups believe that ancient knowledge
didn't just exist in ancient Babylon, but in
Ancient
Atlantis (where objects
like the The Emerald Tablets of Thoth and the lapis exillis.
These objects were lusted after by Rosicrucian Nicholas Roerich and his
temporary ally 32nd Degree Freemason Henry Wallace).
Myths claim that the
lapis exillis was the stone from Lucifer's crown that broken after Lucifer
fought the archangel Michael. This story is found in
Manly P. Hall's
literature. Masonic apologists may deny that the Great Seal is of Masonic
origin (even though Masonic symbols are on them), but the one Dollar Bill is
definitely of Masonic origin.
People certainly will compare it to Riddles and
Stone. In my opinion, the Eye of the Phoenix is a level above Riddles and
Stone in terms of the information describing America's secret history. What
was particularly great about the film was how it described the Jacobite
Rebellions in a simplistic fashion. The Jacobites supported the pro-Catholic
King James II of England. He was forced out of the throne via the Glorious
Revolution of 1688.
The Jacobites in large numbers went into America
and their Scottish descendants influenced the American Revolution (with
Masons like Hugh Mercer).
The Eye of the Phoenix is an excellent film that delves into higher levels
of information revolving around the agenda of
Secret Societies. Nicholas
Roerich, as the documentary proves, wanted to create the
global government
system (even an Asian Union first).
The film is like information overload since it
reaches into more facts then elaborate into another level of concepts.
