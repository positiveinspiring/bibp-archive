Auroracoin sure does have a nice
logo.
The cryptocurrency craze spun into a new realm
of ridiculous with Kanyecoin, Dogecoin, Ron Paul Coin and the
bounty of other clone-coins that sprung up to ride the
Bitcoin wave.
But the latest altcoin to enter the market,
Auroracoin, wants to take the futurist trend back to its
cryptoanarchist roots. The altcoin was designed specifically for Iceland,
and the creator plans to give every citizen of the Nordic country a digital
handful of Auroracoins to kickstart their use.
Auroracoin is the brainchild of cryptocurrency enthusiast
Baldur Friggjar Odinsson, and he'll be the one distributing pre-mined coins
to the entire population of Iceland at midnight on March 25 in a
countrywide "airdrop."
Each Icelandic citizen - all
330,000 of them - will receive 31.8 AUC through a digital transaction.
Citizens all have a national ID number available through a public database,
which will be used to verify their identity.
"So I intend to leverage this system so everyone has a
chance to verify their ID and get their share of Auroracoins. For most,
it will be as easy as logging onto Facebook,"
Odinsson told me. "People will have (at least) a year to
claim their coins."
Why would someone want to give away over 10
million digital coins? To stick it to the man, naturally.
Auroracoin
creators believe the digital currency can buck the "unholy alliance" between
governments and too-big-to-fail banks, by taking the power away from
politicians and giving it back to the people.
Iceland's economy is still reeling from the
country's major financial meltdown in 2008, when greedy
banksters nearly bankrupted the traditionally well-off nation.
The banking system collapsed, followed by a run
on deposits from foreign investors in the Netherlands and UK. Iceland's fiat
currency, the Krona, plummeted; inflation exploded; the stock market did a
nosedive; and the national debt skyrocketed.
(Actually, the currencys problems go back even
further than the 2008 crisis; the Krona has lost 99.5 percent of its value
since 1960 relative to the US dollar.)
Iceland's new 10,000 ISK bill
is
worth about $85, according to the Central Bank.
Iceland
avoided bankruptcy, but spiraled into an
economic recession it's
only recently beginning to recover from.
Major banks were nationalized and the government
imposed capital controls to stabilize the economy that were supposed to be
temporary but are still in place today.
As a result, any foreign currency earned has to
be turned over to the Central Bank of Iceland, people can't freely trade
internationally or invest in business abroad and foreigners are hesitant to
invest in Icelandic companies, which further stifles economic growth.
"I started wondering how to break the cycle, and came to
the conclusion that we had to democratize money in Iceland," Odinsson said.
"It has to be divorced from the corrupt
banks and government. I thought Iceland might be too small and isolated
(because of the capital controls) for a cryptocurrency like bitcoin and
litecoin to naturally take root.
So I thought: What if everyone just got some
cryptocoins and could use them or discard them or do anything they
wanted with them? And as I thought more about this I realized that this
could actually be done."
Odinsson turned to digital currency to get
around these government restrictions.
Remember
when Bitcoin boomed after the
government in Cyprus
tried to pull itself out of financial ruin
by reaching into citizens pockets? Thats what Odinssons hoping will
happen with Auroracoin in Iceland.
So can it work? Well, Iceland is well-positioned
to be a guinea pig for national cryptocurrencies.
It's small - the population's about the size of
San Mateo - and nearly everyone is online and brandishing gadgets.
Icelanders tend to be tech-savvy and well-educated, and Odinsson's betting
it won't be too hard to get people up to speed on virtual currencies. Plus
Iceland
has a thing for virtual stuff anyway.
Odinsson's taking the unconventional approach of
pre-mining half of the Auroracoin stock, which is based off the Litecoin
source code, so that the early adopters won't just be techsperts with
expensive mining hardware but the whole public.
Now he's encouraging developers to make tools
like payment software and virtual wallets for currency, and calling on all
global currency exchanges to accept the new Nordic altcoin come March.
"People will try out the system, they will
send coins and use them for fun, and then they may gradually gain some
economic value. People will speculate on the coins and they will have
some monetary value of at some point," said Odinsson.
"If the Airdrop works in Iceland, I can see
similar schemes being employed in other countries with a history of
economic mismanagement. I know there is an Irish version of Auroracoin
currently in development, and I could see an Argentinean one working as
well."
