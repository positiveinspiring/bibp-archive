Lakhdar Brahimi, member of the UN
Arab League envoy, will speak with the Syrian government.
Brahimi
stated in Cairo:
I answer to no one except the Syrian people. Syrians
aspire to peace, stability and to realizing their goals of freedom and
political progress.
Brahimi who is a representative from Mohammed
Morsis presidential cabinet and member of
the Muslim Brotherhood is
replacing former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to broker a deal with
Assad.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon verbalized his
support for the CIA-sponsored Free Syrian Army; the manufactured terrorist
group facilitating a proxy war in Syria on behalf of the US and Israel.
At the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Ki-moon
stated that he is concerned about the unsubstantiated accounts of Syrian
government attacks on citizens. He believes that by purveying the lies and
propaganda surrounding this created conflict, that they will be given
legitimate review by
the United Nations delegates.
Ki-moon
said:
All of this complicates our efforts to facilitate a transition
and promote the peace the Syrian people deserve. I encourage this council to
maintain its vigilance on Syria, including on the question of
accountability.
Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State,
threatened
that the US and like-mined states will circumvent the UNs pursuits of
diplomacy in Syria for the sake of forcing a regime change.
Clinton said
that Russias lack of support for the US and Israeli schemes in Syria and
Iran are unacceptable.
Clinton affirmed that the UN resolutions are
ineffective,
because weve seen time and time again that Assad will ignore
it and keep attacking his own people.
Of course, the evidence shows that
the Free Syrian Army is instrumental in all the violent attacks against
Syrian civilians; however Clinton coercively continues to purvey
US-controlled propaganda.
Sergey Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister said
that,
[Russia] wont support sanctions [against Syria] because they lead to
nothing. What Syria needs is all external players use their influence to put
all Syrians behind the negotiation table.
Here in the US Senator John McCain has publicly
admonished the Obama administration for not killing more Muslims. According
to McCain, the death toll in Libya should be a template for Obama.
McCain
commented:
The election is about jobs and the economy, but a failed...
national security policy over time is going to lead to significant domestic
problems.
McCain continued:
Its the job of presidents
and candidates to lead and articulate their vision for Americas role in the
world.
The world is a more dangerous place than its been since the end of
the Cold War, and so I think the president should lead and I think
candidates for the presidency should lead and talk about it, and Im
disappointed that there hasnt been more.
As the Syrian conflict becomes a precursor for
Iran, a favored target of the
Zionist-controlled Israeli government, Guido Westerwelle, the German Foreign Minister has implored the Iranian government
to continue international talks concerning their nuclear program.
Westerwelle
said:
We stand together with Israel which means of course that we
share also the concern about the Iranian nuclear program. For us, any kind
of nuclear option weapons in the hands of the Iranian government is not
acceptable. For us nuclear arms in the hands of the Iranian government are
not an optional we will not accept this.
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister,
retorted that,
the Islamic Republic to be nuclear armed is not an option.
Iran has given the UN International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) permission (after being pressured) access to inspect
the Parchin military facility where there are alleged nuclear weapons.
Yukiya Amano, head of the IAEA, believes that Iran owes the UN an
explanation for their endeavors to build a nuclear power plant.
Amano
stated:
Iran has the obligation to fully cooperate with us.
Netanyahu, without proof, continues to decry
Iran is building a nuclear weapon and is gaining support from European
allies such as Britain, France and Germany as well as Canada.
Last week, the Canadian government closed their
embassy in Iran.
John Baird, Canadian Foreign Minister, explained in a
statement that Iran is,
the most significant threat to global peace and
security in the world today.
Canadian officials
warned Canadian citizens not to travel to Iran. Those who have Canadian
citizenship with Iranian nationality are using propaganda to claim that the
Iranian government will become enraged by dual nationality.
The Center for
Strategic & International Studies , a Washington DC-based globalist
think-tank, has
supposed what a US military strike against Irans nuclear facilities
would look like.
