The Dow is at a record high and so are corporate
profits - so why does it feel like most of the country is deeply suffering
right now?
Real household income is the lowest that it has
been in a decade, poverty is absolutely soaring,
47 million Americans are on food stamps and
the middle class is being systematically destroyed.
How can big corporations be doing so well while
most American families are having such a hard time? Isn't their wealth
supposed to "trickle down" to the rest of us?
Unfortunately, that is not how the real world
works.
Today, most big corporations are trying to
minimize the number of "expensive" American workers on their payrolls as
much as they can. If the big corporation that is employing you can figure
out a way to replace you with
a worker in China or with
a robot, it will probably do it. Corporations are in existence to
maximize wealth for their shareholders, and most of the time the largest
corporations are dominated by the monopoly men of the global elite.
Over the decades, the politicians that have
their campaigns funded by these monopoly men have rigged the game so that
the big corporations are able to easily dominate everything. But this was
never what those that founded this country intended.
America was supposed to
be a place where the power of collectivist institutions would be greatly
limited, and individuals and small businesses would be free to compete in a
capitalist system that would reward anyone that had a good idea and that was
willing to work hard.
But today, our economy is completely and totally
dominated by a massively bloated federal government and by absolutely
gigantic predator corporations that are greatly favored by our massively
bloated federal government.
Our founders tried to warn us about the dangers
of allowing government, banks and corporations to accumulate too much power,
but we didn't listen. Now they dominate everything, and the rest of us are
fighting for table scraps.
In early America, most states
had strict laws governing the size and scope of corporations.
Individuals and small businesses thrived in such an environment, and the
United States experienced a period of explosive economic growth. We showed
the rest of the world that capitalism really works, and we eventually built
the largest middle class that the world had ever seen.
But now we have replaced capitalism with
something that I like to call "corporatism". In many ways, it shares a lot of characteristics
with communism, and that is why nations such as communist China have
embraced it so readily.
Under "corporatism", monolithic predator
corporations run around sucking up as much wealth and economic power as they
possibly can. Most individuals and small businesses cannot compete and end
up getting absorbed by the corporations.
These mammoth collectivist institutions are in
private hands rather than in government hands (as would be the case under a
pure form of communism), but the results are pretty much the same either
way. A tiny elite at the top gets almost all of the economic rewards.
There are some out there that would suggest that
the answer to our problems is to move more in the direction of "socialism",
but to be honest that wouldn't be the solution to anything. It would just
change how the table scraps that the rest of us are getting are distributed.
If we truly wanted a return to prosperity, we
need to dramatically shift the rules of the game so that they are tilted
back in favor of individuals and small businesses. A much more pure form of
capitalism would mean more wealth, less poverty and a more equitable
distribution of the economic rewards in this country.
But it will never happen. Most of our
politicians are married to the big corporations and the wealthy elitists
that fund their campaigns. And most Americans are so uneducated that they
believe that what we actually have today is "capitalism" and that the only
alternative is to go "to the left" toward socialism.
Very few people out there are suggesting that we
need to greatly reduce the power of the federal government and
greatly reduce the power of the big corporations, but that is exactly what
we need to do. We need to give individuals and small businesses room to
breathe once again.
With each passing year, things get even worse.
In fact, the founder of Subway Restaurants recently said that the
environment for small businesses is so toxic in America today that he
never would have been able to start Subway if he had to do it today.
For much more on how small business is being
strangled to death in the United States, please see my previous article
entitled "We
Are Witnessing The Death of Small Business in America".
What I want to do now is to discuss some of the
results that "corporatism" is producing in America.
First of all, we continue to see incomes go down
even though we live in an inflationary economy.
As
Time Magazine recently reported, personal incomes took a huge nosedive
during the month of January...
Data released by the Commerce Department
last week showed that
personal income fell 3.6% in January, the biggest decline in 20
years. The drop was even bigger when taxes and inflation are taken into
account. Real personal disposable income fell by 4%, the biggest monthly
drop in half a century.
But this is part of a longer term trend.
Median
household income in the U.S. has declined for
four consecutive years, and it is now significantly lower
than it was all the way back in 2001...
Real median US household income - that's
"real," as in "adjusted for inflation" - was $50,054 in 2011, the most
recent data available from the US Census Bureau. That's 8% lower than
the 2007 peak of $54,489.
Meanwhile, big corporations are absolutely
raking in the cash.
The following is from a recent
New York Times article...
So far in this recovery, corporations have
captured an unusually high share of the income gains, said Ethan
Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The U.S. corporate sector is in a lot
better health than the overall economy. And until we get a full recovery
in the labor market, this will persist.
The result has been a golden age for
corporate profits, especially among multinational giants that are also
benefiting from faster growth in emerging economies like China and
India.
Today, corporate profits as a percentage of U.S.
GDP are at an
all-time high, but wages as a percentage of U.S. GDP are near an
all-time low.
Just check out the following chart. Corporate
profits have absolutely exploded over the past decade...
Meanwhile, wages as a percentage of GDP continue
to fall rapidly...
Most of the jobs being created in America today
are "low wage" jobs.
Tens of millions of Americans are working as
hard as they can only to find that they can barely put food on the table and
provide a roof over the heads of their children. The ranks of the "working
poor" are exploding and the middle class continues to shrink.
Many of you that are reading this article are
members of the working poor. You know what it is like to stare up at your
ceiling at night wondering how you are going to pay the bills next month.
Today, most Americans are living very close to
the edge financially. A recent article
by NBC News staff writer Allison Linn shared some of their stories.
The following is one example...
Crystal Dupont knows what its like to try
to live on the federal minimum wage.
Dupont has no health insurance, so she
hasnt seen a doctor in two years. Shes behind on her car payments and
has taken out pawn shop and payday loans to cover other monthly
expenses. She eats beans and oatmeal when her food budget gets low.
When she got her tax refund recently, she
used the money to get ahead on her light bill.
I try to live within my means, but
sometimes you just cant, said Dupont, 25.
The Houston resident works
30 to 40 hours a week taking customer service calls, earning between
$7.25 and $8 an hour. That came to about $15,000 last year.
Its a wage shes lived on for a while now,
but just barely.
Sadly, the number of Americans that are "just
barely" surviving continues to grow.
But if corporate profits are soaring to
unprecedented heights, then who is getting all of those rewards?
The monopoly men of the global elite are.
Just check out the
following video which does a great job of illustrating how corporatism
has systematically funneled all of the economic rewards in our system to the
very top...
Once again, I want to make it very clear that I
am not advocating socialism as the answer in any way, shape or form.
Socialism takes away the incentive to create wealth and it almost always
results in almost all of the economic rewards going to a very tiny elite
anyway.
As I said earlier, what we need is a return to a
much more pure form of capitalism, but this is so foreign to the way that
most people think that most people will not be able to grasp this.
It certainly would be possible to greatly reduce
the power of the federal government and greatly reduce the
power of the big corporations at the same time, but this is so "outside the
box" for most people that they cannot even conceive of doing such a thing.
We need to create an environment where
individuals and small businesses can thrive once again. But instead, most of
us are content to continue "playing the game" and getting enslaved in even
more debt.
For example, according
to CNBC, auto loans just continue to get larger and continue to get
stretched out for longer periods of time...
American car buyers, attracted by new models
and cheap financing, are taking out bigger auto loans and stretching out
the terms of those loans to a new record length.
New analysis from Experian Automotive shows
the average new car loan in the fourth quarter of last year was $26,691
and stretched out over an average of 65 months. The length of the
average loan is one month longer than the previous record set in the
third quarter of last year.
What will they think of next?
Will we eventually have auto loans that get paid
off over 10 years?
By the way, that is another way that the
monopoly men of the global elite get all of our money. They
enslave us to debt, and we spend year after year of our lives slaving
away to make them even wealthier.
They are very smart. There is a reason why they
have
32 TRILLION dollars stashed away in offshore tax havens. They know how
to play the game, and they are very happy that most of the rest of us are
asleep.
Fortunately, it appears that an increasing
number of Americans are waking up.
For example, I wanted to share with you all an
excerpt from a comment that one of my readers left on
one of my recent articles...
In the past year, I've been slowly but
surely waking up to the nonsense happening around me. There's so many
things I need to simply get off my chest, so excuse the length of this
post.
Recently in the past two years, I've gotten married and have been
medically discharged from the Marines after being injured in
Afghanistan. Being 23 years old and married, my goal is secure a secure
a future for my family, but with the way things are going, I'm not
exactly sure how much of a future we're going to have in 50 years.
I
can't explain it, but I've felt this need to change my attitude and
motivations lately.
I started by turning off the garbage music,
television and other mindless entertainment that seems to plague my
generation. It was easier than it looked - I don't miss most of it
really. The next order of business was to educate myself on world news,
so that's what I did.
Every day, like clockwork, I check all major
mainstream news feeds (NBC, Fox, Abc, CNN, Reuters, BBC, etc.) as well
as not-so-mainstream news sites - yours being one of them. It's
incredible how fast our world changes and the manner in which it
changes.
The local 10 o'clock doesn't show anything but local news,
sports, weather, lottery #'s and whatever else they decide to throw in.
It's a night and day difference once you start to actually research and
see what's happening all over the world. Look at the number of comments
about a news story on the economy and then look at a celebrity story on
the "news"... People are so blind, it truly amazes me. My friends,
family and classmates at college seem to be under a spell of some sort.
They're distracted - and it's contagious.
Nobody I know gives a damn
about global affairs/economics. They're more interested in the newest iPhone, cars, shows, movies, and just about anything else you can think
of. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with these things, but my
friends/family/peers are CONSUMED by these distractions.
When the
election was taking place in 2012, every Tom, Dick and Harry on Facebook
had an opinion and rant. After the circus ended however, everyone simply
went back to posting about parties, kittens, Farmville etc. It's a huge
joke.
For me, it's little terrifying and exciting to see history
unfolding in front of our eyes. This country of ours is going through
big changes now that will most certainly affect our future, so I strive
to adapt and prepare myself and my family. I'm looking at buying my
first home this summer. Right now I live in an apartment right outside
Philly and spend more money on rent than most pay for a mortgage.
I need
a house with a little land to raise chickens, grow fruits/vegetables,
store canned food - and to be as independent from the system as I can.
For my job, I wanted a skill/trade that people would always need, so I
picked the funeral business. On the side, I work in construction and
have been learning everything there is to know about building with my
own two hands.
I feel as though these old forgotten skills are going to
be handy in a short while.
Hopefully we can get a lot more people to wake
up and start breaking out of "the matrix" of control that is all around us.
Right now, the system is designed to continually
funnel more money and more power to the very top of the pyramid. The global
elite are becoming more dominant with each passing day.
Unless something
dramatic happens, at some point the American people will become so powerless
that they won't be able to do anything about it even if they wanted to.
The idea of a very tiny elite completely
dominating all the rest of us goes against everything that America is
supposed to stand for. In the end, it will result in absolute tyranny if it
is not stopped.
