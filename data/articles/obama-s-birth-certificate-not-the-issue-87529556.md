Of course, a candidate must meet legal requirements before running for
public office.
This is a universally agreed upon concept which has been
enumerated in laws in every nation, since the beginning of human
civilization.
However, for those who deeply examine the United States and
how it has drifted from a constitutional republic to the corporate-financier
oligarchy it is today, they might realize the futility of arguing over
"President" Obamas qualifications for an office that has long been
ceremonial, if not entirely theatrical.
The
corporate-financier agenda transcends presidencies.
From Reagan to
Obama, US foreign and domestic policy has moved in a continuously linear
direction toward increasing corporate-financial monopolies and eroding the
role and sovereignty of the US Constitution and the people who are supposed
to execute it.
In 1991, "Neo-Conservative" war monger
Paul Wolfowitz stated
that
the Middle East would be turned upside down and reordered in Americas
favor - ironically, this operation which has been piecemeal planned and
executed year-by-year since then, is finally unfolding in its entirety under
the supposedly "liberal" Obama administration. [1]
Likewise, the seemingly "liberal" free-trade agreements pushed by Clinton,
were expanded into the beginnings of the supranational
Security and
Prosperity Partnership of North America under the supposedly "conservative"
Bush administration.
Of course, the blueprints for the SPP [2] or the
geopolitical reordering of the Middle East werent drawn up by presidential
administrations nor committees amongst Americas elected representatives,
but rather by unelected corporate-funded think-tanks [3] like the
Council on
Foreign Relations or the
Brookings Institute.
These think-tanks represent
the collective interests of the largest corporations and financial
institutions on earth and are the real, often obscure architects of both
American and European foreign and domestic policy.
The only difference one can delineate then, is the brand of propaganda used
during each supposedly ideologically differentiated political administration
to sell this unipolar, unilateral, continuous agenda to the public as it
creeps forward.
But even upon examining each presidential administration, we
are struck with names and affiliations of members who directly represent
these corporate interests.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner (left)
and Attorney General Eric Holder
(center).
To illustrate how entirely ineffectual and meaningless "Obama" is as a
president, lets examine some key members of his administration and what
their affiliations are.
-
Timothy Geithner (Secretary of the Treasury):
Group of 30,
Council on
Foreign Relations, private
Federal Reserve
-
Eric Holder (Attorney General): Covington & Burling lobbying for Merck and
representing Chiquita International Brands in lawsuits brought by relatives
of people killed by Colombian terrorists
-
Eric Shinseki (Secretary of Veteran
Affairs): US Army, Council on Foreign Relations, Honeywell director
(military contractor), Ducommun director (military contractor)
-
Rahm Emanuel (former Chief of Staff): Freddie Mac
-
William Daley (Chief of Staff): JP Morgan executive committee member
-
Susan Rice (UN Ambassador): McKinsey and Company, Brookings Institute,
Council on Foreign Relations
-
Peter Orszag, (former Budget Director): Citi Group, Council on Foreign
Relations
-
Paul Volcker: Council on Foreign Relations, private Federal Reserve, Group
of 30
-
Ronald Kirk (US Trade Representative):
lobbyist, part of Goldman Sachs, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, and
Texas Pacific Group partnership to buyout Energy Future Holdings
-
Lawrence Summers (National Economic Council Director): World Bank, Council
on Foreign Relations
Who amongst Obamas administration can we honestly presume has the peoples,
or even Americas best interests at heart? Goldman Sachs bankers? JP Morgan
bankers? Corporate lobbyists?
Indeed, these are the same banking, corporate,
and political interests that guided the agenda under Bush, Clinton, Bush
Sr., Regan and so on.
While there is some debate over which US president was
in fact the last "real" president who exercised an agenda it genuinely could
claim ownership over, there is no doubt that over the last two decades the
same corporate interests have been entirely steering Americas people and
their destiny with but the veneer of "democracy."
Had John McCain won the elections in 2008, you could rest assured he would
have taken US policy in the exact same direction Obama is going today.
In
fact, McCain is one of the key players who has helped fund and organize the
current unrest sweeping the Middle East, along with a myriad of other
"Republicans" and "Neo-Conservatives." The "Arab Spring" itself was planned
and being staged before Obama even took office.
Ideologically, President Obamas qualifications are important and many are
right to question them.
Realistically, they are a
red herring, as is his
entire presidency. He is in charge of exactly nothing, most likely not even
the tie he puts on in the morning and surely not the words that come out of
his mouth. His entire function is to perpetuate the facade that America is
still run by an elected government and not an illegitimate oligarchy of
corporations and financial institutions.
Arguing over
his birth certificate
engenders him with legitimacy in and of itself - suggesting that if he had
proper qualifications he would be a "legitimate" president. But he, like his
predecessor Bush, are both entirely illegitimate, as is the system they
purportedly preside over.
Recognizing this grave reality, and instead concentrating on the
corporate-financier interests that have hijacked American politics is
essential to restoring a true constitutional republic.
For it is not whose
hands we think hold the power, it is in whose hands that really hold the
power that shapes US policy. Definitively, US policy does not favor the
people, definitively the power is not in the peoples hands. As long as we
grasp to the illusion that through the futile exercise of elections we are
somehow "in control," it will remain this way perpetually.
The fact that our
president is in charge of absolutely nothing and that his duties have long
been shifted to an unelected corporate-financier oligarchy is the issue, not
his dubious qualifications.
