Transition towns
are a movement modeled after the
United Nations Agenda 21 to create communities that adhere to the
initiative that center around reducing CO2 emissions.
Under the alarmist perspective of man-made climate change, founders Rob
Hopkins and Naresh Giangrande created the
Transition Model based on studies conducted
by Ben Brangwyn on global relocalization agendas.
At an initial Transition Bristol meeting in the UK, the
Tudor Trust began funding this initiative.
This led to the creation of the
Transition Initiatives Primer, an
explanatory guide to the scheme and fake grassroots groups who coerced
communities into adopting the plan.
Transition Initiatives were created in,
-
Australia
-
Canada
-
England
-
Germany
-
Ireland
-
Italy
-
the Netherlands
-
New Zealand
-
Scotland
-
South Africa
-
Spain
-
Sweden
-
USA
-
Wales
Training courses have been developed to
ensure that this ideal becomes a global movement.
Issues under Transition Initiatives governance
are food production, manipulation techniques in dealing with local
governments, sustainable housing, reduction of public energy consumption,
adaptation of communities to resemble transition cities and control over
local economies.
A propaganda film entitled In Transition 1.0 was produced with the global
audience in mind, giving more credence to this UN takeover of our local
communities.
Groups like the West Coast Environmental Law (WCEL) have been pushing
for Transition Towns for several years. In British Columbia alone, they have
begun to take root in Victoria , Vancouver , Nelson , Salt Spring, Powell
River and the Cowichan Valley.
The
Green Communities Program has help spread the propaganda of SmartGrowth
ideology through
SmartGrowth BC and the
SmartGrowth Bylaws Guide a marketing
tract on British Columbia bylaws that support UN Agenda 21.
The dangers that Transition Towns impose on our sovereignty and
individuality are:
-
Refocus town planning and infrastructure
on implementation of Agenda 21
-
Appear to be grassroots operations
-
Promote the Peak Oil mythology as an
energy scare-tactic
-
Support SmarthGrowth which is code for
Agenda 21
-
Aspire to control framing, disburse
ability to farm, and pressure governmental policies on farming that
reflect Agenda 21
-
Use the hoax of man-made climate change
as the purpose for imposing policy control by building cities that
are designed to reduce carbon emissions
-
Securitize local food stores,
businesses, healthcare and fuel
-
Ensure SmarthGrowth controls all
citizens ability to acquire any needs for human survival
-
Create internal advocacies that band
together to purvey Transition Town propaganda to elected officials
and local governments
By working on the ground level, Transition Towns
can over take states and nations quicker than funneling through the
bureaucracy of national governments.
To anticipate any problems, this movement has secured a legion of lawyers to
be hired at the whim of the
Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund, a WCEL
society developed to infuse the court system with legal disputes to
intimidate lawmakers into submitting to their suggestions.
They impose identifying structures and rules
that encourage... favored strategies as defined by the Transition Town
movement.
By erecting a parallel structure to the local governments in place, that can
ensure authorization by those local government through time honored and
patient hounding of officials in community meetings where they use the
Delphi Technique to coerce innocent citizens into backing their agendas.
In this way, at community meetings the
grassroots advocates of Transition Towns can assume a false devils
advocate position and divide and conquer the attendees at the meetings to
ensure their desired outcome is supported by the end of the meeting.
In the end places like
Victoria,
are being over-run by the Transition Town
movement which has convinced the Victoria City Council to send a bill to the
taxpayers for an estimated $140,000 to influence and network a fake organic
movement with the assistance of the Occupy Movement in Victoria, BC.
This is why the UN Agenda 21 is so insidious. It attacks at the local level,
getting the citizens of these towns and cities to fight for its
implementation; all the while hiding its true nature.
The future of our world under Agenda 21 means buffer zones, areas designated
inhabitable for humans in the name of biodiversity and the securitization of
all resources need for base human survival. And the UN will be at the helm.
This is the dream of
the global Elite.
