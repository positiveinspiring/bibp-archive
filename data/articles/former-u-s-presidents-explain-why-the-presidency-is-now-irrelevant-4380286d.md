Election time is here again, and Americans are scrambling to make sense of the choices being pimped out to us by the establishment.
So much hangs in the balance right now, and it's impossible to escape election coverage as the entire world watches with bated breath. Oh, who will it be?
Recent polls suggest around 40% of Americans consider themselves to be 'independent' voters, which is understandable, as this nation has always been one of maverick thinkers and innovators. The conscientious, the creative and the courageous, I believe.
Yet, now we're also well-trained, obedient, and habituated to over-indulgence in tradition and entertainment. And as it is, the powers that be are also at the top of their game when it comes to corralling the American people into the phony left/right political paradigm.
And they're better than ever at tricking Joe Public into believing that anti-establishment candidates come from establishment political parties.
People are waking up to the charade, though, and the election cycles do highlight the ever-growing demand for something better than what we have. Eventually this awakening will reach critical mass, but this storm is a long time coming.
Some of our most revered presidents and leaders have warned us that what we see and know as the outer face of the American government is hardly the true picture of the actual forces that control the American government.
Many past presidents and other prominent American figures have alluded to a secret takeover of our nation that has been underway since its inception. In this model, the president is little more than a distraction, a figure head for the people to focus on while the real work is done behind the curtain.
Without honest money, un-adulterated by private entities, human civilization will be always be paralyzed by public and private debt.
The banking establishment, having been working behind the scenes to accumulate political power for centuries now, has unprecedented control over world governments and world events.
Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence, and third president wrote:
"I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies." Thomas Jefferson U.S. President (1801-1809) in a letter written to John Taylor on May 28, 1816
"I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies."

Furthermore, former Vice-President and U.S. Senator John C. Calhoun remarked in a speech given on May 27, 1836:
"A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many and various powerful interests, combined in one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in banks." John C. Calhoun Vice President (1825-1832) and U.S. Senator

After president Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, giving formation to our private central bank, he is quoted to have shown considerable remorse in the following statement:
"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men." Woodrow Wilson U.S. President (1913-1921)

Wilson went on to confide in his memoirs other things that were of concern to him regarding the hidden power structure in America:
"Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it." Woodrow Wilson 28th President of the United States, The New Freedom, 1913

Franklin D. Roosevelt warned us also of the heavy influence of the banking elite on national politics in this statement:
"The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson." Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 32nd President of the United States (19331945) in a letter to Colonel Edward M House dated November 21, 1933, as quoted in F.D.R.: His Personal Letters, 1928-1945.

in a letter to Colonel Edward M House dated November 21, 1933, as quoted in F.D.R.: His Personal Letters, 1928-1945.
In addition to the secretive banking powers in the US, the true power structure in America is also made up of a complex web of corporations, secret societies, think-tanks, and influential people, and this network has been exposed as well by many former leaders.
In 1913, former president Theodore Roosevelt shared his perception of how true political influence works:
"Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day." Theodore Roosevelt 26th President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, An Autobiography, 1913 (Appendix B)

References to a hidden hand played by the Illuminati and Freemasonry extend all the way back to our first president, George Washington, who himself was a known member of several secret societies.
"It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am. The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavored to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of separation). That Individuals of them may actually had a separation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned." George Washington 1st President of the United States (17891797 from a letter that Washington wrote on October 24, 1798, which can be found in the Library of Congress.

President Eisenhower, in his farewell address in 1961 warned of the entrenchment of the military industrial complex:
"Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations. This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence - economic, political, even spiritual - is felt in every city, every Statehouse, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together." Dwight D. Eisenhower U.S. President 1953-1961

Finally, former president John F. Kennedy made these poignant remarks the same year in 1961:
"The very word 'secrecy' is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe no war ever posed a greater threat to our security. If you are awaiting a finding of 'clear and present danger,' then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence - on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed." John F Kennedy 35th President of the United States, from a speech delivered to the American Newspaper Publishers Association on April 27, 1961 and known as the "Secret Society" speech

We don't really elect our leaders, as it is now.
We select people to work as agents of the Deep State, a shadowy unelected agency of interests and figures much more powerful than any elected stooge. The charade of American presidential politics is more of a drain on our society than an opportunity for renewal.
As John Perkins, author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman, recently put, 'does the next president matter?'
"It isn't so much about who next sits in the Oval Office or even changing the mechanics of economics. It is about changing the ideas, the dogmas that currently drive politics and economics: debt and fear, insufficiency, divide and conquer. It is about moving from ideas about merely being sustainable to ones that include regenerating areas devastated by agriculture, mining, and other destructive activities. It is about We the People taking control. It is about a revolution in consciousness and actions. It is about making the transition from a Death Economy to a Life Economy. A turning point in the American revolution occurred when Thomas Paine helped change the perceived reality by writing, 'If there must be trouble, let it be in my day that my child may have peace.' This is another time of crisis, a time to follow Paine's advice. It is a time to own up to our power and not expect the president or any other politician to change the world for us. It is a time for us to act in ways that will assure peace for our children." John Perkins author of Confessions of An Economic Hit Man

When the people of this nation and of this world are one day truly ready for something other than the corrupt and dangerous government we have, then, as history tells us, an unfathomable great change will come seemingly over night, without us even turning out to vote.
