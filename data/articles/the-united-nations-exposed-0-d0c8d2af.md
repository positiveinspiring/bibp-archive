Chapter 8
The UN's International Court of Criminals
(ICC)
[The proposed International Criminal Court] repudiates the Constitution, the
Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence and cancels the 4th of
July....
What are the limits on the ICC? There are none. It's insane! 1
Professor Charles Rice, Notre Dame University School of Law
With the stroke of a pen, President Bill Clinton has a last chance to
safeguard humankind.... He must simply sign a treaty, finalized in Rome in
1998, to create a permanent International Criminal Court. 2
Robert S. McNamara (CFR, TC) and Benjamin B. Ferencz, New York Times
op-ed, December 12, 2000
The United States is today signing the 1998 Rome Treaty on the International
Criminal Court.3
President Bill Clinton (CFR, TC), December 31, 2000
On December 31, 2000, David Scheffer (CFR), President Clinton's Ambassador
for the International Criminal Court, signed the ICC Rome Treaty for the
United States.
This was an incredibly radical, revolutionary act, which will
bring devastating consequences for the American people, if they allow the
U.S. Senate to ratify it. If ratified and implemented, this brazenly
treasonous scheme by the CFR Insiders would rend asunder our constitutional
protections and cause American citizens to be vulnerable to prosecution
before international UN tribunals for alleged violations of lawless UN
"laws."
If convicted by this UN kangaroo court system, American citizens
could be subjected to whatever penalties the
ICC judges decree, including imprisonment wherever the black-robed
globalists may decide to send them.
Regardless of whether one views the prospect of the ICC sympathetically or
with horror and revulsion, it must be admitted by all who are fair-minded
that U.S. accession to this treaty would represent a momentous, colossal
change to our judicial and constitutional system. Who but a totalitarian
would argue that a change of this magnitude should be even contemplated, let
alone attempted, without an informed debate and a genuine public consensus?
Yet there has been no public debate of this issue.
Would Americans embrace
this attack on their most precious rights if there had been?
Obviously not,
which is why the entire crusade for the ICC has been carried out by the
Insiders as a massive stealth campaign, aimed at imposing UN judicial rule
on an unsuspecting America.
Ask yourself: Did you see the development of the ICC covered on the evening
news on NBC, ABC, CBS, and CNN? Did you see the supposed merits and real
dangers debated on Face the Nation, Nightline, The Capital Gang, Hardball,
60 Minutes, Larry King Live, or 20/20?
Of course you didn't, because those
debates never happened. At the time that President Clinton announced the
U.S. signing of the Rome Treaty, probably not one U.S. citizen in 100 had
heard of the document, and not one in a thousand had any inkling of what it
entailed.
The organized forces for world government, however, had been intensely
active for several years preparing to spring the ICC trap. Pro-ICC articles
were appearing in the internationalist journals, pro-ICC studies were issued
by globalist think tanks, a fortune in foundation grants was provided to
pro-ICC academics and NGOs to attend international conferences and symposia
all of this was taking place on an enormous scale, while most Americans
were completely in the dark.
The op-ed quoted above by Robert McNamara and Benjamin Ferencz appeared in
the New York Times during the closing days of the Clinton administration. It
is a typical example of the means by which the one-world Insiders signal
their political
agents and intelligentsia to act on an issue of serious import to their
global agenda.*
*
As Defense Secretary under both JFK and LBJ, Mr. McNamara (CFR, TC) was a
principal architect of the insane doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction
(MAD) and the disastrous
U.S. debacle in Vietnam. Following those efforts, which were fiascoes for
America, but bonanzas for the Insiders, McNamara went on to serve the CFR
cabal as head of the World Bank, where he lavished billions of dollars taken
from U.S. taxpayers on Communist and socialist regimes throughout the world.
Professor Ferencz of Pace University, an inveterate one-worlder and author
of many books promoting disarmament and world government, is one of the
early architects and proponents of the ICC. His books Defining International
Aggression (1975), An International Criminal Court A Step Toward World
Peace (two volumes, 1980), Enforcing International Law (two volumes, 1983),
and PlanetHood: The Key to Your Future (1991) greatly influenced the
development of the ICC Statute, as did he personally. Professor Ferencz was
the recognized eminence griese at the UN's ICC Summit in Rome, and it was
due to his personal, vigorous lobbying that the undefined crime of
"aggression" was included in the ICC Statute.
Similar editorials, op-eds, articles and commentaries
appeared in the Washington Post, Christian Science Monitor, and many other
Establishment print and broadcast propaganda organs, while, at the same
time, the mammoth, pro-ICC, NGO network intensified its lobbying for the UN.
All of the usual chorus voices began hymning in unison, creating the false
impression that a new "consensus" had formed, that "enlightened" political
leaders now accepted the virtuous and unanswerable arguments of the selfless
representatives of "global civil society."
Hereafter, only hopeless,
heartless, Neanderthal, "sovereigntists" would oppose the creation of this
desperately needed institution that is designed (we are told) to establish
"the rule of law" globally, "stop the culture of impunity," and bring to
justice the world's most terrible criminals.
American Criminal Justice System
But should we Americans toss out our own
justice system or allow it to be subsumed in some global ICC system on the
basis of promises by the UN and its champions?
Do any of the UN's member
regimes now have in place better justice systems than we enjoy under the
U.S. Constitution? Ha! The thought is ludicrous!
One doesn't have to do an extensive study of foreign jurisprudence to know
that it would be a very bad idea to run afoul of the ruling authorities in
Red China, Russia, Cuba, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, Nigeria, and dozens of
other tyrannical regimes throughout the world, where concepts of due
process, the rule of law, and constitutional rights do not even exist.
Even in many Western European countries such as France, Germany, and Italy,
rights that Americans take for granted jury trial, habeas corpus, speedy
trial, the right to counsel are weak to nonexistent. During the Rome
conference, ICC proponents frequently pointed to the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal as a model.
That is a chilling thought to anyone familiar with the
Tribunal prosecutor's position that five years is a reasonable time for a
defendant to wait in prison for a trial. Other ICC advocates frequently cite
the European Court of Human Rights as a model for the ICC. But this
supranational judicial body has ruled in various cases that pretrial
detention of three, four, or even seven years is acceptable!
The American criminal justice system is far from perfect, but in comparison
to what exists in most of the rest of the world, it stands out as a shining
beacon. And this is so in spite of the fact that over the past half century
it has been mangled and transmuted into a system that would be completely
unrecognizable to the framers of our Constitution. As originally conceived,
virtually all criminal law was left to the purview of state and local
governments.
There were no federal laws regarding murder, rape, robbery,
theft, vandalism, fraud, and other ordinary criminal matters. The central
government was restricted to prosecuting treason, espionage, malfeasance of
office, and other matters directly related to the federal government.
Over the past few decades, however, the federal government's reach has been
drastically lengthened through a massive onslaught of federal legislation,
presidential executive orders, and judicial decrees. The damage to our
freedoms and constitutional order springing from the federal judiciary has been catastrophic.
The
federal courts, especially since the New Deal, have been running amok,
acting as a super-legislature in matters as diverse as abortion, education,
the environment, pornography, race relations, sexual conduct, sedition,
employer-employee relations, religious practice, local police, state
prisons, housing, etc.
Some of our early founders recognized the potential for these tragic
developments long, long ago.
Writing in 1821, toward the end of his life, Thomas Jefferson predicted the dire consequences America might suffer as a
result of judicial usurpation:
"It has long ... been my opinion ... that the
germ of dissolution of our federal government is in the constitution of the
federal judiciary ... working like gravity by night and by day, gaining a
little today and a little tomorrow, and advancing its noiseless step like a
thief over the field of jurisdiction, until all shall be usurped from the
States, and the government of all be consolidated into one.
To this I am
opposed, because when all government ... shall be drawn to Washington as the
center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided ... and
will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we
separated."4
Jefferson's pessimistic view was based upon his sober assessment of the
corruptibility of human nature. He was warning, in the citation above, of
the dangers inherent in the natural tendency in human beings and
institutions toward greater and greater corruption, not against any
particular combination of individuals then scheming to overturn our system
of government.
However, as gloomy as his projections were, it is doubtful
that even he could have imagined the outrageous and seditious usurpations of
our federal judiciary.
And it is certain that he and every other Founding
Father, along with generations of earlier Americans, would stand in
dumfounded disbelief to learn that America's leaders today are seriously
proposing that the people of the United States be subjected to the
jurisdiction of an international judiciary.
The Campaign for an ICC
The vast majority of Americans today are blissfully
ignorant of the fact that such a radical proposal is even under
consideration. But the truth is that it is perilously close to becoming a
reality. And unless the American public becomes sufficiently alerted,
alarmed, and activated to oppose this incredibly subversive scheme, it will
become reality.
The formal campaign for an ICC was launched in the summer of 1998 at a
United Nations summit convened in Rome. The month-long conference concluded
on July 17th with the announcement that 120 nations had voted in favor of
approving the new "Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court" and
that it would enter into effect and become binding upon the entire planet as
soon as it was formally ratified by 60 nations. The ostensible targets of
the new ICC are dictators, tyrants, and other nasty practitioners of
"genocide, war crimes, aggression and crimes against humanity."
But the UN
membership is replete with murderous dictators, tyrants, and the worst
practitioners of these and other heinous crimes. The likes of Fidel Castro, Yasir Arafat, Sam Nujoma, Mikhail Gorbachev, Li Peng, Vladimir Putin, and
other bloody-handed thugs have always been welcomed and honored at the
United Nations.
The Real Targets of the ICC
Who, then, are the real targets of the ICC
proponents?
Those who stand in the way of their proposed "new world order,"
naturally. That includes, of course, so-called "right-wing dictators," like
General Augusto Pinochet, who has never been forgiven by the international
Socialist-Communist-Insider cabal for overthrowing the brutal Communist
regime of their favored left-wing dictator: Salvador Allende in Chile.
In
1998, while the 82-year-old Pinochet was visiting England for medical
treatment, he was arrested and held on a warrant issued by Baltazar Garzon,
an investigative magistrate from Spain. Judge Garzon, a Marxist activist,
was pursuing a revolutionary political agenda, not seeking justice for real
crimes. Many legal authorities condemned Garzon's action for violating
established canons of international law.
Eduardo Fungarino, Spain's chief
government prosecutor, filed a court motion charging that the judge had
broken many legal procedures in issuing the arrest order, and that Garzon
had "an absolute lack of jurisdiction" over alleged crimes committed outside
of Spain against citizens of other countries.5
However, the Insider-controlled prostitute press would not allow these
inconvenient facts, and others of equal importance in the case, to come to
the attention of the American people.*
*
For an in-depth look at the orchestrated global campaign to "get" Pinochet,
together with a thorough analysis of the charges leveled against him, please
see: "Patriot Enchained," The New American, September 13, 1999; and
"Persistent Persecution of Pinochet," The New American, April 10, 2000 at
www.thenewamerican.com/focus/pinochet/.
Instead, we were treated to a nonstop
diet of shrill editorials and shrieking demonstrators demanding not only
that Pinochet be drawn and quartered, but that a permanent international
tribunal, the ICC, be established to bring "dictators" of his ilk to
justice.
But the phony "human rights" activists demanding Pinochet's scalp could not
care less about genuine violations of human rights and real justice for
bloody dictators. At the time of Pinochet's arrest in England on the Spanish
warrant, Communist dictator Fidel Castro was welcomed to Spain and PLO
terrorist leader Yasir Arafat was a guest of the Clinton White House.
Likewise, Jiang Zemin, the butcher of Tiananmen Square, as well as the
bloody-handed Soviet tyrants Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin, and Vladimir
Putin and virtually every other mass-murdering despot of the left have
been conspicuously ignored by the self-righteous frauds leading the ICC
choir.
However, anti-Communist military leaders and heads of state like Pinochet
are not the only or even the chief targets of the ICC. The primary
target of the ICC architects is the United States and the American people.
This was conspicuously obvious
at the ICC Summit in Rome, where America-bashing was the order of the day.
As one who was in Rome "at the creation," this reporter can attest firsthand
to the fact that the long-standing hatred toward the United States by the
vast majority of the pathetic regimes that comprise the UN menagerie is
still alive and well.
Day after day, throughout the ICC conference, the U.S.
was subjected to tirades and condemnations by official delegates as well
as by NGOs for supposed past and present sins. In fact, from the nonstop
anti-U.S. invective one might imagine that America is the principal, if not the
sole, source of evil in the world.
The billions of dollars that we have
ladled out over the past half-century to these countries and the UN itself
have purchased us not an iota of good will.
There were calls at the Rome conference for prosecuting Presidents Bush
(George W.'s father) and Clinton for war crimes. A handbill distributed at
the summit by the Society for Threatened Peoples, one of the Marxoid groups
among the NGO horde, charged the U.S. with these past "war crimes":
"Dropped
15 million tonnes of bombs in the Vietnam War, conducted air raids on
Cambodia, supported Indonesia's annexation of East Timor, backed right-wing
death squads in Guatemala in the early eighties."6
Months before the Rome conference had even begun, the UN Commission on Human
Rights had targeted the U.S. with a purely political attack alleging that
this country unfairly applies the death penalty. The Insiders' White House
agent Bill Clinton aided the scheme by inviting UN human rights monitor
Bacre Waly Ndiaye to America to meet with U.S. officials and inspect our
prisons.
In September and October 1997, Mr. Ndiaye came to the U.S. and
visited prisons in Florida, Texas, and California.
The New York Times
reported:
For Mr. Ndiaye, the visit to the United States is important
because of the precedent it sets [emphasis added].
"I am really hoping that with this visit, the United States
Government will show the way to other countries which have been resistant to
United Nations mechanisms," he said.7
Mr. Ndiaye's U.S. precedent-setting tour provided the Insider-funded NGO
radicals at Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the ACLU, and the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights with a propaganda bonanza.
The Insider
media cartel retailed all their lurid charges of the horrors of the American
justice system. In April 1998, shortly before the ICC Summit, the UN
Commission on Human Rights released a report based on the Ndiaye
investigation. The report charged that application of the death penalty in
the United States is tainted by racism, economic discrimination, politics,
and an excessive deference to victims' rights.8
The Commission also accused the U.S. of being in violation of the 1966 UN
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and called on the U.S. to suspend all
further executions until U.S. state and federal laws were brought into
compliance with "international standards."9
This provided the NGO cabal with
another golden opportunity for a round of media-enhanced attacks on the U.S.
legal system. One of the aims of this report and its companion NGO campaign
was to sow seeds of doubt and guilt in American public opinion concerning
the fairness of American justice; this would make the upcoming ICC proposals
for an international system seem much more reasonable. It also gave the
Clinton administration an opportunity to strike a moderate pose while
advancing this radical agenda.
The Clintonites said, in effect,
"Well, we
think these UN charges are exaggerated but we recognize that the U.S.
justice system isn't perfect. We want to be a good example to the rest of
the world and cooperate with the UN."
This was all a colossal, insidious charade, of course. Not to mention the
epitome of hypocrisy. At the very time that Kofi Annan's Commission was
denouncing the U.S. justice system, the sainted Mr. Annan was suppressing
information that he had been a key silent accomplice in the Rwandan
genocide.
Lt.Gen. Romeo Dallaire, the former commander of Canada's UN
"peacekeeping" mission to Rwanda in 1994, revealed that he had sent a fax to
Annan's office warning that Rwandan security officials had been ordered to
"register" the (predominantly Christian) Tutsis as an obvious prelude to
mass liquidation.
Annan's office ordered Dallaire to "assist in the recovery
of all weapons distributed to or illegally acquired by civilians," which, in
effect, meant disarming the intended victims!10 So Mr. Annan, whose
Commission was chastising the U.S. for gross abuses, was himself involved in
one of the most atrocious genocides in world history. Likewise, many of the
UN representatives at Rome who cited the Commission report in their
denunciations of the U.S. were representing some of the most repressive and
brutal regimes in the world.
We don't mean to imply that all of the U.S. bashing at Rome was emanating
from Third World countries, Communist satrapies, or UN agencies. Canada,
Norway, Britain, Germany, Italy, and other
U.S. "allies" vied for top anti-U.S. honors, too. On the final day of the
conference, when the very minimal objections of the U.S. to the ICC were
soundly defeated, the assembled delegations erupted in a tumultuous and
defiant display of anti-American jubilation which was joined by much of
the press corps, including "American" reporters.
Naturally, the U.S. NGOs topped all others in attacking their homeland. As
Reuters reported, "the American NGOs were the scourge of the United
States,"11 at the conference. On July 8th, Terra Viva, one of the major NGO
newspapers that has become "must reading" at UN summits, carried this
headline in large print: "Police Brutality Deeply Rooted in US"
The story
announced the release of a Human Rights Watch report charging a national
epidemic of police brutality.12
The 440-page report, entitled Shielded From
Justice: Police Brutality and Accountability in the United States,13 was
time-released for maximum effect on the conference. Human Rights Watch
spokesman Richard Dicker, who was one of the top NGO strategists at Rome,
seemed never to be satisfied if not hurling vitriol at the U.S.
But that has
not hindered him or his group from receiving hundreds
of thousands of dollars from the Ford Foundation, which has enabled the
group to push the ICC agenda.14
NGO Evolution-Revolution
The revolutionary role of the NGOs at the Rome
summit is one of the biggest untold stories of that event. As CFR staffer
Jessica T. Mathews approvingly noted in Foreign Affairs, ever since the 1992
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, NGOs have been exercising more and more
influence at UN conferences.15
But the Rome experience marked a watershed in
the incredible evolution of NGO power. At the ICC Conference, the NGOs were
given unprecedented access and privileges and accorded a status almost on a
par with official state delegations. NGO experts and officials, inflamed
with their own self-importance, regularly addressed the ICC Plenary Session
as though they were official heads of state.
They remonstrated, cajoled, and
chastised the assembled plenipotentiaries to adopt NGO positions, which
always argued for larger jurisdiction and more power for the Court. NGO
briefing papers, reports, resolutions, press releases, and legal opinions
flooded the conference. The NGO Coalition for an International Criminal
Court (CICC) was given a large suite of offices within the FAO (the UN's
Food and Agriculture Organization) conference building itself, just down the
hall from the main meeting room, so that the NGO activists who outnumbered
the official delegates could overwhelm the conferees with "good cop-bad
cop" lobbying tactics.
World Federalist Association leader William Pace (CFR), Richard Dicker, and
other CICC spokesmen incessantly reminded the world press and the assembled
dignitaries that they were vested with the moral authority of "over 800 NGOs
worldwide representing all sectors of global society." It was, of course, a
gigantic confidence game; the NGO "diversity" amounted to a choice of your
favorite flavor of socialism.
Take your pick: Castroite, Trotskyite,
Marxist, Stalinist, Leninist, Maoist, Gramsciite.
Certainly among the most influential of the NGOs was the Rome-based
Transnational Radical Party (TRP), an openly Communist organization that
boasts Mayor of Rome Francesco Rutelli and European Commissioner Emma Bonino
among its members,16 both of whom played prominent roles at the ICC confab.
Together with its sister organization, No Peace Without Justice, the TRP and
other NGOs organized daily demonstrations and panel discussions, in addition
to ICC-related broadcasts on its radio program, Radio Radicale. As the host
country and the nation with the largest delegation 58 delegates, as
compared to the next largest, the U.S., with 40 Italy was in the driver's
seat.
The Prodi government and Mayor Rutelli gave every advantage to the NGO
radicals, granting permission for streets to be blocked for marches and
demonstrations and even allowing NGO militants to set up a continuous
propaganda stage partially blocking the entrance to the FAO/ICC conference
site. On July 14th (Bastille Day, of course) Mayor Rutelli granted the TRP
and its CICC allies an especially rare privilege: a torchlight march through
the Via Sacra (Sacred Way), a path through the temple ruins that reportedly
has only been opened twice this century.
The Transnational Radical Party headquarters in Rome was the center for many
NGO activities that spilled out of the FAO complex. At that venue, Judge
Richard Goldstone, former prosecutor for the UN war crimes tribunals for
Rwanda and Yugoslavia, presented a report promoting the ICC.17 Not
surprisingly, the report was produced by a task force headed by Goldstone
and sponsored by the Twentieth Century Fund.
This American Insider
foundation has been funding radical, left-wing causes for much of this
century. Accompanying Judge Goldstone was Morton Halperin (CFR), the
notorious Marxist activist and longtime associate of the Institute for
Policy Studies. President Clinton attempted to place Halperin in a
sensitive, top Defense Department post, but the Senate, prodded by exposure
of his subversive background, refused to confirm him.
Halperin stayed on for
awhile in other capacities in the Clinton regime, before moving on to a
position in the CFR's Studies Department, and
then an appointment as vice president of the Twentieth Century
Fund.*
Of course, leading the clamorous "global civil society" cabal** was the
World Federalist Movement, whose representative, William R. Pace (CFR), ran
the NGO show.
* In Rome, Halperin and Goldstone joined one-worlders Ben Ferencz, John Roper
(Royal Institute for International Affairs), and Marino Busdachin
(Secretary-General of No Peace Without Justice) at the Transnational Radical
Party offices to help make the pitch for global governance. In January 2001,
the CFR announced that Halperin would be rejoining the group's staff to
"direct a project on democracy."
**
Among the many other groups comprising
the storied "diversity" of the NGO claque were: Parliamentarians for Global
Action; European Law Students Association; Women's Caucus for Gender
Justice; Caribbean Association for Feminist Research and Action; American
Bar Association; International Federation of Lawyers; International Women's
Rights Action Watch; Beyond Borders; the Carter Center; Maryknoll Society
Justice and Peace Office; Center for Reproductive Law and Policy; National
Association of Democratic Lawyers; OXFAM UK; Earth Action International; Pax
Christi International; Sisterhood Is Global Institute; Global Policy Forum;
Gray Panthers; Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation; Washington Office on
Latin America; International Association of Democratic Lawyers;
International Association of Judges; International Commission of Jurists;
Women's Action Group; International Council of Jewish Women; World Council
of Churches; and the World Order Models Project.
The World Federalists (headed by CFR veteran John B.
Anderson), who have long advocated world government, clearly have mastered
the fine art of demagoguery and mob control. However, they do not exercise
their leadership by virtue of strategic vision, tactical genius, or moral
suasion. They have been accorded the piper status by those who pay for the
tunes.
It costs a great deal of money to assemble a horde of activists, fly
them around the globe, set them up with accommodations and entertainment in
one of the most expensive cities in the world, and equip them with all the
resources they need to effectively push a coordinated, prearranged agenda.
Even more than at previous summits, the NGO "citizen lobbyist" campaign at
Rome was completely the creation of the same old Pratt House coterie: the CFR and its foundation, corporate, think-tank network.
If you wish to take the time to do so, you can research the individual NGOs
and the grants they received. But there is no need to do so, since these
"anti-Establishment" rabble-rousers admit their dependence on the globalist
Establishment "sugar daddies." According to the Coalition for an ICC website
home page, "Substantial funding for the CICC communications project has been
received from private foundations, progressive governments, participating
organizations of the Coalition, and private individuals, including major
grants from the European Union, the Ford Foundation, and the MacArthur
Foundation."19
The principle NGO press conferences in Rome were presided over by CFR
handler William Pace, and his lieutenants Richard Dicker and Professor
Rhonda Copelon, a lesbian legal scholar from City University of New York,
affiliated with the Women's Action Group. Likewise, they and a select cadre
of hardcore radicals led the daily strategy sessions at the NGO office
suite.
These events, which this writer attended, usually featured 50 to 100
or more NGO activists of the Femi-Leninist, Enviro-Leninist, Afro-Leninist,
Homo-Leninist, Lesbo-Leninist stripe. This motley menagerie of uncivil
specimens, always spouting hateful diatribes and Marxist cant, by no means
can legitimately claim to represent "global civil society."
But their CFR
paymasters are hellbent on legitimizing this false claim, because these
misfits and miscreants are essential components in their "pressure from
below" strategy.
Shaping a Consensus
The enormity of the deception and the immense resources
and coordination of this global network are amazing to behold.
But even the
astounding NGO-Insider spectacle at Rome fails to provide a full
appreciation of the fact that it was but a part of a much larger scheme. The
Rome gathering was the culmination of a multi-year program of PrepComs
(Preparatory Committee meetings) that had been carefully orchestrated to
arrive at the contrived global "consensus" that is now being celebrated by
the votaries of "world order."
The final PrepCom meeting, held from March
16th through April 3rd, 1998 in New York, was a mini-preview of the Rome
summit, with all the major actors, from UN officials and pro-ICC national
delegates, to NGO activists, honing their skills, practicing their parts,
and coordinating their activities with their Insider media allies.
In order to get all of the cadres marching in sync, and to create the
appearance of popular support, the Insiders had to set up a host of ongoing
programs throughout the country before, during, and after the Rome summit.
One of the major events attended by this writer was an ICC symposium at the
luxurious Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles on February 26, 1998.
The CFR
leadership was obvious.
The moderator of the program was Dr. Edwin M. Smith
(CFR), professor of international law at the University of Southern
California and formerly an appointee to the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency by President Clinton (CFR). The main speaker for the
program was Ambassador Scheffer (CFR), formerly an adjunct professor of
international law at Georgetown University Law Center, President Clinton's
alma mater.
The program was sponsored by:
-
the United Nations Association
-
the
World Federalist Association
-
Amnesty International
-
the American Civil
Liberties Union
-
the American Bar Association
-
Friends of the United
Nations
-
B'nai Brith
-
the law firms of Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher, and
Milbank, Tweed, Hadley, and McCloy
CFR members play prominent, if not
dominant, leadership roles in all of these organizations.
These individuals and organizations are engaged in what Professor George C.
Lodge (CFR) calls,
"quietly assembling global arrangements" and "shaping a
consensus."
Lodge, who is a professor at the Harvard Business School and a
trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, writes in his
1995 book, Managing Globalization in the Age of Interdependence, that there
are,
"energetic and creative individuals in government, interest groups, and
corporations [who] are quietly assembling global arrangements to deal with
crises and tensions. For the most part, they work outside of legislatures
and parliaments and
are screened from the glare of the media in order to find common interests,
shape a consensus, and persuade those with power to change."20
Professor Thomas R. Dye of Florida State University described this same
"consensus shaping" process many years earlier in his 1976 book Who's
Running America? Dye noted that the CFR and its related "policyplanning
groups are central coordinating points in the entire elite policy-making
process."
He went on to describe how they function:
They bring together people at the top of the corporate and financial
institutions, the universities, the foundations, the mass media, the
powerful law firms, the top intellectuals, and influential figures in the
government. They review the relevant university-and foundation-supported
research on topics of interest, and more importantly they try to reach a
consensus about what action should be taken on national problems under
study.
Their goal is to develop action recommendations
explicit policies or programs designed to resolve or ameliorate national
problems. At the same time, they endeavor to build consensus among
corporate, financial, university, civic, intellectual, and government
leaders around major policy directions.21
The Proposed ICC
The proposed ICC has proceeded through this process, and
has gone from "action recommendation" to "consensus" to (almost) full
realization.
The ICC is breathtakingly audacious on many counts but the most
amazingly brazen claim, and one unprecedented even for so outrageous an
outfit as the United Nations, is the assertion by the UN that once the Rome
Statute is ratified by 60 countries (a completely arbitrarily selected
number, by the way: totals ranging from 30 to 90 were considered), the newly
established court will then have compulsory jurisdiction over all countries,
even those that refuse to ratify it.
This is, of course, a revolutionary and
flagrant violation of the most fundamental principle of treaty law, namely,
that a treaty is an agreement that
is binding only upon those who are party to the treaty. Yet the ICC zealots
had no qualms of conscience in repeatedly and piously invoking "the rule of
law" to advance their totally lawless proposal.
By December 31, 2000, when President Clinton signed the ICC treaty, 27
nations had ratified the document, and the court's advocates were predicting
that the requisite 60 ratifications would be obtained by 2002. The new court
is to be headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands, which is already host to
the World Court, the UN tribunal that was set up in 1945 to try cases
between nations.
The new ICC would try individuals who are accused of
violating international laws.
Dr. Charles Rice, professor of law at Notre Dame University, has termed the
ICC "a monster," both in concept and reality, noting that it effectively,
"repudiates the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of
Independence and cancels the 4th of July."
"In our system," Professor Rice
explains, "law is supposed to be a rule of reason which, in a sense,
controls the state and compels the state to operate under the law."
22
But
the super-jurisdictional ICC, he points out, has no legitimate basis for its
claimed authority, no protections against abuses, no accountability, and
virtually no limits to its jurisdiction.
"What are the limits on the ICC?"
he asks, and then answers, "There are none. It's insane!" 23
What do esteemed legal scholars like Professor Rice find so monstrous about
the ICC?
Let's take a look at the kinds of crimes the new ICC would claim
jurisdiction over, and then briefly examine the structure and procedures of
the court as laid out in the Rome Statute.
The 166-page Rome Statute claims universal jurisdiction for the ICC to try
individuals charged with genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and
aggression, anywhere on earth. In the first place, these four "core" crimes
are so vaguely defined and were so contentiously debated at the Rome summit
that no reasonable claim to consensus can be made concerning even the
definition of these crimes, which is the most basic requirement
for just laws. Which means the definition of the crimes will be left
completely to the arbitrary interpretation of the ICC judges. (In the case
of the crime of "aggression," no definition was even included in the
statute.)24
But the severe definitional problems associated with these four "core
crimes" don't even begin to hint at the nightmarish possibilities that would
be unleashed under a global ICC system. First of all, there is no question
that, once formally established, many other additional "crimes" will be
added to the ICC's jurisdiction. We already have promises on that score from
the drafters of the Rome Statute.
In 1993, Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd (CFR) introduced a resolution
calling for the establishment of the ICC to combat "unlawful acts such as
war crimes, genocide, aggression, terrorism, drug trafficking, money
laundering, and other crimes of an international character."25 Mikhail
Gorbachev and other one-world luminaries have called for adding "ecological
crimes" to the jurisdiction of the ICC.26
At the Rome ICC Summit, many
delegates insisted that these and a vast array of other crimes piracy,
child pornography, kidnapping, political assassination, religious
persecution, discrimination based on sexual orientation, etc. be included.
The delegates were repeatedly assured by the Summit leaders that these could
be added later, but were told they should not jeopardize the establishing of
the ICC by insisting on inclusion of all these other crimes at the
beginning.
So, as if an ICC with global jurisdiction over the four "core crimes" were
not bad enough, the dials have been preset for a vast expansion of court
jurisdiction. But what about the ICC system itself?
Some of the most
egregious threats that are built into the system include:
-
No right to trial by jury.
-
No right to a speedy trial.
-
Judges, prosecutors, and counsel drawn from murderous totalitarian and
authoritarian regimes with juridical views completely at odds with Western
concepts of law and justice and
specifically hateful of America and Americans.
-
No appeal of an ICC decision, except to the same ICC court.
-
A person convicted under the ICC may be sentenced to prison anywhere in the
world the ICC chooses.
-
An ICC prosecutor may decide to bring charges against an individual based
upon accusations provided by NGOs, such as the ACLU, the Environmental
Defense Fund, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, etc.
In other words, under an ICC regime, an American citizen, whether in the
United States or abroad, could be accused of a crime by a member of some
militant group, then indicted, extradited, tried, and convicted by
prosecutors and judges from North Korea, Zambia, Mongolia, China, Iraq,
Cuba, Turkey, or Russia.
And then sentenced to serve time at some
undisclosed prison in Zimbabwe, Kosovo, Albania, Cambodia, or Algeria.
U.S. Leaders Support ICC
Any reasonable American quickly realizes that
Professor Rice was indeed accurate in describing the proposed ICC regime as
"a monster." And therein lies much of our problem: Average Americans cannot
conceive that anything so patently absurd and obviously injurious to
American interests could ever be adopted by our elected leaders.
Besides,
they reason, even if the U.S. Senate ratifies the ICC statute, the U.S.
government would never allow wild abuses of the ICC against American
citizens. And, as the U.S. is indisputably the most powerful nation on
earth, we have no reason to fear that the ICC could force its jurisdiction
on us in any case harmful to our interests.
But, as we pointed out in Chapter 1, depending on U.S. courts and elected
officials to guard against abuses under a UN regime is a dangerously
misplaced hope. Many of them are already on record as favoring global
institutions with legislative, executive, and judicial powers that could
override U.S. sovereignty and supersede our constitutional checks and
balances.
Every American should take note of the fact that the primary objection posed
by U.S. Ambassador David Scheffer (CFR) and the U.S. State Department at the
ICC Summit was the concern that
U.S. Armed Forces personnel serving abroad might stand in danger of being
accused of war crimes under the ICC statute.27 This is a very real concern,
of course, but far from the only or most important concern.
The official
U.S. position appears to be that if this one major area of concern can be
addressed with some exemption or written assurance, then the U.S. could live
with the ICC all in the interest of showing U.S. respect for the "rule of
law" worldwide.
This is like leaders of a church girls camp agreeing to allow the League of
Reformed Rapists to run their camp as long as the League provides written
certificates attesting to the reform of its members and guarantees that the
"ex-rapists" will not force themselves on girls under, say, 13 years of age.
Or police officials agreeing to merge with the Mafia in a "joint
crime-fighting effort," as long as Mafia dons agree to have their extortion
squads stop breaking the legs of shopkeepers (for a few weeks, at least) and
to nix the use of dum-dum bullets by their hit men.
It ought to be obvious to all that you don't establish justice and fight
crime by inviting the worst criminals and terrorists to join the
prosecution, sit on the judiciary, and staff the police. Yet that is
precisely what the ICC would do.
And America's opinion cartel is more than ready to accept this monstrosity.
The main organs of the CFR-dominated media (New York Times, Washington Post,
ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, etc.) have supported the ICC. The massive NGO
rent-a-mob, from radical enviros to so-called human rights activists, are
eagerly pushing this agenda.
That is to be expected.
However, what should be most alarming to Americans is that many of our top
officials together with their co-conspirators in the Insider media,
foundations, and think tanks are leading the whole movement to subject the
United States to international jurisdiction under the ICC. As mentioned in
Chapter 1, members of the U.S. Supreme Court have already stated that in the
21st century they will be relying on other international sources
for their decisions.28 Many of America's leading law journals and "legal
authorities" have adopted an "internationalist" view of the law which holds
that U.S. law must yield to wider "global legal mandates."
The federal executive branch has intervened several times in state criminal
matters at the behest of the UN. In November 1998,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (CFR) urged the state of Texas to
yield to a World Court decision and the appeals of "global civil society"
and overturn the death penalty in the case of Joseph Stanley Faulder.29
This
U.S. concession was an important part of the Insiders' calculated plan
gradually to concede U.S. sovereign jurisdiction in criminal matters. This
is not merely a grab for power by UN globocrats, third-world dictators,
Communist commissars, and fuzzy-headed Marxist academics; it is a colossal
grab for global judicial power by one-world votaries within our own
government and other centers of power in our society.
A Global Constabulary
And, naturally, it doesn't stop with an ICC. A global
judiciary presupposes a global constabulary, both to arrest accused
"criminals" and to enforce the Court's rulings. Thus the same Pratt House
thought cartel that has brought us the ICC monster is pushing hard for an
international police corps.
Writing in Foreign Affairs in 1997, New York
University professor of law Theodor Meron (CFR) told his one-world comrades
that,
"from now on, international criminal tribunals must be more
effectively supported by police power."
Professor Meron continued:
Just as there can be no national justice without a police force, there can
be no effective international justice without arrests, subpoenas,
investigations, and a reliable enforcement mechanism. The international
community's inability to create such a mechanism, whether for ad hoc
criminal tribunals or for the proposed international criminal court,
threatens all efforts to create a system of international criminal justice.
But we must not give up in despair.30
In December 2000, senior government officials from more than 150 countries
converged on Palermo, the capital of Sicily, for a UN conference ostensibly
aimed at stepping up the global fight against "transnational organized
crime." The event, led by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and UN Under
Secretary-General Pino Arlacchi, featured 20 heads of government and
unveiled a new UN convention against the scourge of organized crime.
Mr. Arlacchi, the UN's top globocop and the driving force behind the
gathering, has been lionized by the Establishment media as "the world's
mafia buster."
Reputedly a top expert on the Sicilian Mafia, Arlacchi has
been criticized by others who dispute his exaggerated and premature claims
of victory over the mob.
"To talk of the death of the Mafia is unwise it
is just sleeping,"31 said Maria Falcone, in a report by The Daily Telegraph
of London.
Miss Falcone, sister of famed anti-Mafia investigator Giovanni
Falcone, who was assassinated by a Mafia bomb in 1992, says,
"How can you
say that the Mafia is over when some of the biggest bosses, including the
biggest, Bernardo Provenzano, are still at large?" 32
Good question.
Even more important questions concern the UN's direct and
indirect roles in helping establish and expand the global crime syndicates.
Over the past decade, for instance, tens of billions of dollars that the IMF
has pumped into Russia have been tunneled into the Russian Mafia, fueling
the massive growth of this ruthless criminal behemoth, which the UN now
points to as a prime target of its current crusade.*
* See the following articles from The New American: "Crime Fighters
Converge," August 22, 1994; "G-Men Going Global?" January 23, 1995; "Enemy
Within the Gates" and "Russian Mafia: Organized Crime is Big Business for
the KGB," February 19, 1996; "Russia's Global Crime Cartel," May 27, 1996;
"Drug War on the West," April 10, 2000 at www.thenewamerican.com/focus/russia/.
At best, this would be evidence of gross incompetence. But any reasonably
intelligent analysis of the available evidence points directly to conspiracy
by the world government advocates to create the problem in order to justify
the "solution," which, as usual, involves the transfer of more power to the
UN.
Of course, by any reasonable standard, we would have to
acknowledge that many, if not most, of the regimes that comprise the UN
General Assembly are themselves criminal enterprises, thugocracies in which
the cleverest and most ruthless thugs have clawed their ways to the top.
Certainly that is the case as regards such "respectable" UN member states as
Russia, China, Belarus, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, Montenegro, Albania, Georgia,
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Zimbabwe, and dozens of other regimes where
the organized crime cartels are mere extensions of the governments'
police-state apparatuses.
The UN has served well to cover the official
criminal dealings of these governments, especially the central roles played
by the Communist regimes of Russia, China, and Cuba over the past three
decades in directing and overseeing the largest narcotics operations in the
world.*

See: Joseph Douglass, Red Cocaine: The Drugging of America and the West
(1999). Also the following articles from The New American: "Danger! KLA in
the USA," May 24, 1999; "Narco-Terrorism: Drug War on the West," and
"Narco-Dollarization," April 10, 2000, at
www.thenewamerican.com/focus/drugs/.
Mr. Arlacchi, as the UN's head of drug control and crime prevention, has
been a key player in providing this cover to the criminal regimes involved.
Now, according to Arlacchi, the UN must be empowered to deal with the global
crime "crisis." One of the UN's Palermo proposals calls for the creation of
a UN fund to help poorer states fight the crime syndicates.
"This is the new
UN," said Arlacchi, "We are trying to create the UN of the future."33
The would-be globocops also insist that since organized crime is now a
"transnational phenomenon," the nations of the world must "harmonize" their
criminal codes and crime-fighting methods and efforts.
"What we are trying
to do here is set some strong universal standards for the fight against
crime," said Arlacchi at the Palermo conference. "If we don't do that then
criminals simply move their headquarters from those countries that are
fighting the problem to those that aren't." 34
In this, Arlacchi is parroting the Establishment party line that the CFR
brain trust began promoting in earnest during the
1990s. Foreign Affairs has been the lead conduit, as usual.
Typical is this
offering from CFR factotum Jessica T. Mathews in the journal's
January/February 1997 issue:
"Globalized crime is a security threat that
neither police nor the military the state's traditional responses can
meet. Controlling it will require states to pool their efforts and to
establish unprecedented cooperation ... thereby compromising two cherished
sovereign roles. If states fail, if criminal groups can continue to take
advantage of porous borders and transnational financial spaces while
governments are limited to acting within their own territory, crime will
have the winning edge."35
Organized crime isn't the only excuse the one-worlders have for grabbing
global police powers; terrorism is another.
Writing in the Summer 2000 issue
of Foreign Policy (the Carnegie Endowment's sister journal to the CFR's
Foreign Affairs), Robert Wright opined:
"The most compelling incentive for
broader and deeper supranational governance may come from terrorism and
crime.... Policing will increasingly need to be a cooperative international
venture, and increments of national sovereignty will have to be
surrendered." 36
Similar paeans to global policing in law journals, law enforcement
periodicals, and academic publications have been preparing the legal
community, the law enforcement community, politicians, and opinion molders
for this planned transformation of the UN into a planetary "Globocop."
Thus we have counterparts to the Palermo conference and the UN crime
convention purporting to offer solutions to the problem of terrorism. Which,
again, would be laughable, except that the matter is so deadly serious. For,
as in the case of organized crime, the member regimes of the UN who piously
intone of the need to combat terrorism are some of the major promoters and
sponsors of terrorist groups worldwide.
Those prime sponsors include:
Russia, China, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Algeria, North Korea to
name a few.
The Insider-Communist cabal is accelerating the drive to install their
planned system of global injustice. They intend to
control not only the judges and the courts but also the prosecutors and the
police. If we allow them to succeed, we will soon be shackled in a state of
affairs too horrible to imagine: a global gulag in which the most vicious
criminals are the jailers.
But now that Bill Clinton is out of the White House, we don't have to worry
on this score, right? We wish that were so; unfortunately it isn't.
The Bush
administration has been less than comforting on this issue. In an October
12, 2000 meeting hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations, CFR member
Condoleezza Rice
who was then George W. Bush's foreign policy advisor was asked whether a
Bush administration would support the ICC. Dr. Rice replied, in part:
"Governor Bush has not yet taken a position on the [ICC]. I will tell you
that I think there are concerns for a country like the United States.... I
was deeply disturbed that someone would think it necessary to investigate
whether NATO had committed war crimes in the bombing of Kosovo."37
In other
words, she was repeating for CFR Team B the same "red herring" issue that
Mr. Scheffer offered as an objection for CFR Team A. The plan, obviously, is
for this false issue to be resolved as a way to soften U.S. opposition to
the ICC. Perhaps NATO troops will be given immunity from ICC prosecution in
exchange for accepting prominent roles as ICC "enforcers."
It should be plain that the ICC cannot be made acceptable by any amending or
reforming. It is not just flawed around the edges but at the very core. It
is not wrong just in particulars, but in principle.
It must be opposed and rejected en toto.
We must heed James Madison who
warned:
... it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties. We
hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of
[the] noblest characteristics of the late Revolution. The freemen of America
did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise and
entangled the question in precedents. They saw all the consequences in the
principle, and they avoided
the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this lesson too much,
soon to forget it.
The ICC would be a disaster even if it were proposed by honorable men.
But
as the proposed agency of a criminal conspiracy against freedom and justice,
it should be rejected out of hand.
