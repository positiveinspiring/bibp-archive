The Eight Families
June 1, 2011
The Four Horsemen of Banking,
-
Bank of America
-
JP Morgan Chase
-
Citigroup
-
Wells Fargo,
...own the Four Horsemen of Oil,
-
Exxon Mobil
-
Royal Dutch/Shell
-
BP
-
Chevron Texaco,
..in tandem with,
But
their monopoly over the global economy does not end at the edge of the oil
patch.
According to company 10K filings to the SEC, the Four Horsemen of Banking
are among the top ten stock holders of virtually every Fortune 500
corporation.[1]
So who then are the stockholders in these money center banks?
This information is guarded much more closely. My queries to bank regulatory
agencies regarding stock ownership in the top 25 US bank holding companies
were given Freedom of Information Act status, before being denied on
"national security" grounds. This is rather ironic, since many of the bank's
stockholders reside in Europe.
One important repository for the wealth of the global oligarchy that owns
these bank holding companies is US Trust Corporation - founded in 1853 and
now owned by Bank of America.
A recent US Trust Corporate Director and
Honorary Trustee was
Walter Rothschild.
Other directors included:
-
Daniel
Davison of JP Morgan Chase
-
Richard Tucker of Exxon Mobil
-
Daniel Roberts of
Citigroup
-
Marshall Schwartz of Morgan Stanley [2]
J. W. McCallister, an oil industry insider with House of Saud connections,
wrote in The Grim Reaper that information he acquired from Saudi bankers
cited 80% ownership of the New York Federal Reserve Bank - by far the most
powerful Fed branch - by just eight families, four of which reside in the US.
They are,
-
the Goldman Sachs,
Rockefellers, Lehmans and Kuhn Loebs of New
York
-
the
Rothschilds of Paris and London
-
the Warburgs of Hamburg
-
the Lazards of Paris
-
the Israel Moses Seifs of Rome
CPA Thomas D. Schauf corroborates McCallister's claims, adding that ten
banks control all twelve Federal Reserve Bank branches.
He names,
-
N.M.
Rothschild of London
-
Rothschild Bank of Berlin
-
Warburg Bank of Hamburg
-
Warburg Bank of Amsterdam
-
Lehman Brothers of New York
-
Lazard Brothers of
Paris
-
Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York
-
Israel Moses Seif Bank of Italy
-
Goldman
Sachs of New York
-
JP Morgan Chase Bank of New York
Schauf lists William
Rockefeller, Paul Warburg, Jacob Schiff and James Stillman as individuals
who own large shares of the Fed. [3]
The Schiffs are insiders at Kuhn Loeb.
The Stillmans are Citigroup insiders, who married into the Rockefeller clan
at the turn of the century.
Eustace Mullins came to the same conclusions in his book The Secrets of the
Federal Reserve, in which he displays charts connecting the Fed and its
member banks to the families of Rothschild, Warburg, Rockefeller and the
others. [4]
The control that these banking families exert over the global economy cannot
be overstated and is quite intentionally shrouded in secrecy. Their
corporate media arm is quick to discredit any information exposing this
private central banking cartel as "conspiracy theory".
Yet the facts remain.
The House of Morgan
The Federal Reserve Bank was born in 1913, the same year US banking scion
J.
Pierpont Morgan died and the Rockefeller Foundation was formed.
The House of
Morgan presided over American finance from the corner of Wall Street and
Broad, acting as quasi-US central bank since 1838, when George Peabody
founded it in London.
Peabody was a business associate of the Rothschilds. In 1952 Fed researcher
Eustace Mullins put forth the supposition that the Morgans were nothing more
than Rothschild agents.
Mullins wrote that the Rothschilds,
"
preferred to
operate anonymously in the US behind the facade of J.P. Morgan & Company".
[5]
Author Gabriel Kolko stated,
"Morgan's activities in 1895-1896 in selling
US gold bonds in Europe were based on an alliance with the House of
Rothschild." [6]
The Morgan financial octopus wrapped its tentacles quickly around the globe.
Morgan Grenfell operated in London. Morgan et Ce ruled Paris. The
Rothschild's Lambert cousins set up Drexel & Company in Philadelphia.
The House of Morgan catered to the,
-
Astors
-
DuPonts
-
Guggenheims
-
Vanderbilts
-
Rockefellers
It financed the launch of AT&T, General Motors, General
Electric and DuPont.
Like the London-based Rothschild and Barings banks,
Morgan became part of the power structure in many countries.
By 1890 the House of Morgan was lending to Egypt's central bank, financing
Russian railroads, floating Brazilian provincial government bonds and
funding Argentine public works projects. A recession in 1893 enhanced
Morgan's power. That year Morgan saved the US government from a bank panic,
forming a syndicate to prop up government reserves with a shipment of $62
million worth of Rothschild gold. [7]
Morgan was the driving force behind Western expansion in the US, financing
and controlling West-bound railroads through voting trusts. In 1879
Cornelius Vanderbilt's Morgan-financed New York Central Railroad gave
preferential shipping rates to John D. Rockefeller's budding Standard Oil
monopoly, cementing the Rockefeller/Morgan relationship.
The House of Morgan now fell under Rothschild and Rockefeller family
control. A New York Herald headline read, "Railroad Kings Form Gigantic
Trust".
J. Pierpont Morgan, who once stated,
"Competition is a sin", now
opined gleefully, "Think of it. All competing railroad traffic west of St.
Louis placed in the control of about thirty men." [8]
Morgan and Edward Harriman's banker Kuhn Loeb held a monopoly over the
railroads, while banking dynasties Lehman, Goldman Sachs and Lazard joined
the Rockefellers in controlling the US industrial base. [9]
In 1903 Banker's Trust was set up by the Eight Families. Benjamin Strong of
Banker's Trust was the first Governor of the New York Federal Reserve Bank.
The 1913 creation of the Fed fused the power of the Eight Families to the
military and diplomatic might of the US government. If their overseas loans
went unpaid, the oligarchs could now deploy US Marines to collect the debts.
Morgan, Chase and Citibank formed an international lending syndicate.
The House of Morgan was cozy with the British House of Windsor and the
Italian House of Savoy. The Kuhn Loebs, Warburgs, Lehmans, Lazards, Israel
Moses Seifs and Goldman Sachs also had close ties to European royalty.
By
1895 Morgan controlled the flow of gold in and out of the US.
The first
American wave of mergers was in its infancy and was being promoted by the
bankers. In 1897 there were sixty-nine industrial mergers. By 1899 there
were twelve-hundred. In 1904 John Moody - founder of Moody's Investor
Services - said it was impossible to talk of Rockefeller and Morgan
interests as separate. [10]
Public distrust of the combine spread. Many considered them traitors working
for European old money. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, Andrew Carnegie's US
Steel and Edward Harriman's railroads were all financed by banker Jacob
Schiff at Kuhn Loeb, who worked closely with the European Rothschilds.
Several Western states banned the bankers. Populist preacher William
Jennings Bryan was thrice the Democratic nominee for President from 1896
-1908. The central theme of his anti-imperialist campaign was that America
was falling into a trap of "financial servitude to British capital".
Teddy
Roosevelt defeated Bryan in 1908, but was forced by this spreading populist
wildfire to enact the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act. He then went after the
Standard Oil Trust.
In 1912 the Pujo hearings were held, addressing concentration of power on
Wall Street. That same year Mrs. Edward Harriman sold her substantial shares
in New York's Guaranty Trust Bank to J.P. Morgan, creating Morgan Guaranty
Trust. Judge Louis Brandeis convinced President Woodrow Wilson to call for
an end to interlocking board directorates. In 1914 the Clayton Anti-Trust
Act was passed.
Jack Morgan - J. Pierpont's son and successor - responded by calling on
Morgan clients Remington and Winchester to increase arms production. He
argued that the US needed to enter WWI.
Goaded by the Carnegie Foundation
and other oligarchy fronts, Wilson accommodated.
As Charles Tansill wrote in
America Goes to War,
"Even before the clash of arms, the French firm of
Rothschild Freres cabled to Morgan & Company in New York suggesting the
flotation of a loan of $100 million, a substantial part of which was to
be left in the US to pay for French purchases of American goods."
The House of Morgan financed half the US war effort, while receiving
commissions for lining up contractors like GE, Du Pont, US Steel, Kennecott
and ASARCO.
All were Morgan clients. Morgan also financed the British Boer
War in South Africa and the Franco-Prussian War. The 1919 Paris Peace
Conference was presided over by Morgan, which led both German and Allied
reconstruction efforts. [11]
In the 1930's populism resurfaced in America after Goldman Sachs, Lehman
Bank and others profited from the Crash of 1929. [12]
House Banking
Committee Chairman Louis McFadden (D-NY) said of the
Great Depression,
"It
was no accident. It was a carefully contrived occurrence... The international
bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so they might
emerge as rulers of us all".
Sen. Gerald Nye (D-ND) chaired a munitions investigation in 1936.
Nye
concluded that the House of Morgan had plunged the US into WWI to protect
loans and create a booming arms industry. Nye later produced a document
titled The Next War, which cynically referred to "the old goddess of
democracy trick", through which Japan could be used to lure the US into
WWII.
In 1937 Interior Secretary Harold Ickes warned of the influence of
"America's 60 Families". Historian Ferdinand Lundberg later penned a book of
the exact same title.
Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas decried,
"Morgan influence... the most pernicious one
in industry and finance today."
Jack Morgan responded by nudging the US towards WWII.
Morgan had close
relations with the Iwasaki and Dan families - Japan's two wealthiest clans - who have owned Mitsubishi and Mitsui, respectively, since the companies
emerged from 17th Century shogunates.
When Japan invaded Manchuria,
slaughtering Chinese peasants at Nanking, Morgan downplayed the incident.
Morgan also had close relations with Italian fascist Benito Mussolini, while
German Nazi Dr. Hjalmer Schacht was a Morgan Bank liaison during WWII.
After
the war Morgan representatives met with Schacht at the Bank of International
Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland. [13]
The House of
Rockefeller
BIS is the most powerful bank in the world, a global central bank for the
Eight Families who control the private central banks of almost all Western
and developing nations.
The first President of BIS was Rockefeller banker
Gates McGarrah - an official at Chase Manhattan and the Federal Reserve. McGarrah was the grandfather of former CIA director Richard Helms. The
Rockefellers - like the Morgans - had close ties to London.
David Icke writes
in
Children of the Matrix, that the Rockefellers and Morgans were just
"gofers" for the European Rothschilds. [14]
BIS is owned by,
-
The Federal Reserve
-
Bank of England
-
Bank of Italy
-
Bank of
Canada
-
Swiss National Bank
-
Nederlandsche Bank
-
Bundesbank
-
Bank of France
Historian Carroll Quigley wrote in his epic book
Tragedy And
Hope
that BIS
was part of a plan,
"to create a world system of financial
control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each
country and the economy of the world as a whole... to be controlled in a
feudalistic fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert
by secret agreements."
The US government had a historical distrust of BIS, lobbying unsuccessfully
for its demise at the 1944 post-WWII
Bretton Woods Conference.
Instead the
Eight Families' power was exacerbated, with the Bretton Woods creation of
the IMF and
the World Bank. The US Federal Reserve only took shares in BIS
in September 1994. [15]
BIS holds at least 10% of monetary reserves for at least 80 of the world's
central banks, the IMF and other multilateral institutions. It serves as
financial agent for international agreements, collects information on the
global economy and serves as lender of last resort to prevent global
financial collapse.
The
BIS promotes an agenda of monopoly capitalist fascism. It gave a bridge loan
to Hungary in the 1990's to ensure privatization of that country's economy.
It served as conduit for Eight Families funding of Adolf Hitler - led by the
Warburg's J. Henry Schroeder and Mendelsohn Bank of Amsterdam. Many
researchers assert that BIS is at the nadir of global drug money laundering.
[16]
It is no coincidence that BIS is headquartered in Switzerland, favorite
hiding place for the wealth of the global aristocracy and headquarters for
the P-2 Italian Freemason's Alpina Lodge and Nazi International.
Other
institutions which the Eight Families control include,
Bretton Woods was a boon to the Eight Families. The IMF and World Bank were
central to this "new world order".
In 1944 the first World Bank bonds were
floated by Morgan Stanley and First Boston. The French Lazard family became
more involved in House of Morgan interests. Lazard Freres - France's biggest
investment bank - is owned by the Lazard and David-Weill families - old
Genoese banking scions represented by Michelle Davive. A recent Chairman and
CEO of Citigroup was Sanford Weill.
In 1968 Morgan Guaranty launched Euro-Clear, a Brussels-based bank clearing
system for Eurodollar securities. It was the first such automated endeavor.
Some took to calling
Euro-Clear "The Beast".
Brussels serves as headquarters
for the new European Central Bank and for NATO. In 1973 Morgan officials met
secretly in Bermuda to illegally resurrect the old House of Morgan, twenty
years before Glass Steagal Act was repealed. Morgan and the Rockefellers
provided the financial backing for Merrill Lynch, boosting it into the Big 5
of US investment banking. Merrill is now part of Bank of America.
John D. Rockefeller used his oil wealth to acquire Equitable Trust, which
had gobbled up several large banks and corporations by the 1920's. The Great
Depression helped consolidate Rockefeller's power. His Chase Bank merged
with Kuhn Loeb's Manhattan Bank to form Chase Manhattan, cementing a
long-time family relationship.
The Kuhn-Loeb's had financed - along with Rothschilds
- Rockefeller's quest to become king of the oil patch. National
City Bank of Cleveland provided John D. with the money needed to embark upon
his monopolization of the US oil industry. The bank was identified in
Congressional hearings as being one of three Rothschild-owned banks in the
US during the 1870's, when Rockefeller first incorporated as Standard Oil of
Ohio. [17]
One Rockefeller Standard Oil partner was Edward Harkness, whose family came
to control Chemical Bank.
Another was James Stillman, whose family
controlled Manufacturers Hanover Trust. Both banks have merged under the JP
Morgan Chase umbrella. Two of James Stillman's daughters married two of
William Rockefeller's sons. The two families control a big chunk of
Citigroup as well. [18]
In the insurance business, the Rockefellers control Metropolitan Life,
Equitable Life, Prudential and New York Life. Rockefeller banks control 25%
of all assets of the 50 largest US commercial banks and 30% of all assets of
the 50 largest insurance companies. [19]
Insurance companies - the first in
the US was launched by
Freemasons through their Woodman's of America
- play a
key role in the Bermuda drug money shuffle.
Companies under Rockefeller control include,
-
Exxon Mobil
-
Chevron Texaco
-
BP
Amoco
-
Marathon Oil
-
Freeport McMoran
-
Quaker Oats
-
ASARCO
-
United
-

-
ITT
-
International Harvester
-
Xerox
-
Boeing
-
Westinghouse
-
Hewlett-Packard
-
Honeywell
-
International Paper
-
Pfizer
-
Motorola
-
Monsanto
-
Union Carbide
-
General Foods
The Rockefeller Foundation has close financial ties to both Ford and
Carnegie Foundations.
Other family philanthropic endeavors include,
-
Rockefeller Brothers Fund
-
Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research
-
General Education Board
-
Rockefeller University
-
University of
Chicago - which churns out a steady stream of far right economists as
apologists for international capital, including Milton Friedman
The family owns 30 Rockefeller Plaza, where the national Christmas tree is
lighted every year, and Rockefeller Center.
David Rockefeller was
instrumental in the construction of the World Trade Center towers. The main
Rockefeller family home is a hulking complex in upstate New York known as Pocantico Hills.
They also own,
-
a 32-room 5th Avenue duplex in Manhattan
-
a
mansion in Washington, DC
-
Monte Sacro Ranch in Venezuela
-
coffee
plantations in Ecuador
-
several farms in Brazil
-
an estate at Seal Harbor, Maine
-
resorts in the Caribbean, Hawaii and
Puerto Rico [20]
The Dulles and Rockefeller families are cousins.
Allen Dulles created the
CIA, assisted the Nazis, covered up the Kennedy hit from his Warren
Commission perch and struck a deal with the Muslim Brotherhood to create
mind-controlled assassins. [21]
Brother John Foster Dulles presided over the phony Goldman Sachs trusts
before the 1929 stock market crash and helped his brother overthrow
governments in Iran and Guatemala. Both were
Skull & Bones, Council on
Foreign Relations (CFR) insiders and 33rd Degree Masons. [22]
The Rockefellers were instrumental in forming the
depopulation-oriented Club
of Rome at their family estate in Bellagio, Italy. Their Pocantico Hills
estate gave birth to the
Trilateral Commission.
The family is a major funder
of the eugenics movement which spawned Hitler, human cloning and the current
DNA obsession in US scientific circles.
John Rockefeller Jr. headed the Population Council until his death. [23] His
namesake son is a Senator from West Virginia. Brother Winthrop Rockefeller
was Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas and remains the most powerful man in
that state.
In an October 1975 interview with Playboy magazine,
Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller - who was also Governor of New York
- articulated his family's patronizing worldview,
"I am a great believer in planning -
economic, social, political, military, total world planning."
But of all the Rockefeller brothers, it is Trilateral Commission (TC)
founder and Chase Manhattan Chairman David who has spearheaded the family's
fascist agenda on a global scale.
He defended,
He was the biggest
financier of the CFR, the TC and (during the Vietnam War) the Committee for
an Effective and Durable Peace in Asia - a contract bonanza for those who
made their living off the conflict.
Nixon asked him to be Secretary of Treasury, but Rockefeller declined the
job, knowing his power was much greater at the helm of the Chase.
Author
Gary Allen writes in
The Rockefeller File that in 1973,
"David Rockefeller met with twenty-seven
heads of state, including the rulers of Russia and Red China."
Following the 1975
Nugan Hand Bank/CIA coup against Australian Prime
Minister Gough Whitlam, his British Crown-appointed successor Malcolm Fraser
sped to the US, where he met with President Gerald Ford after conferring
with David Rockefeller. [24]

Part 2
Freemasons and The House of Rothschild
June 8, 2011
In 1789 Alexander Hamilton became the first Treasury Secretary of the United
States.
Hamilton was one of many Founding Fathers who were Freemasons. He
had close relations with the Rothschild family which owns the Bank of
England and leads the European Freemason movement.
-
George Washington
-
Benjamin Franklin
-
John Jay
-
Ethan Allen
-
Samuel Adams
-
Patrick Henry
-
John
Brown
-
Roger Sherman,
...were all
Masons.
Andrew Hamilton
Roger Livingston helped Sherman and Franklin write the Declaration of
Independence.
He gave George Washington his oaths of office while he was
Grand Master of the New York Grand Lodge of Freemasons. Washington himself
was Grand Master of the Virginia Lodge. Of the General Officers in the
Revolutionary Army, thirty-three were Masons. This was highly symbolic since
33rd Degree Masons become Illuminated. [1]
Populist founding fathers led by,
-
John Adams
-
Thomas Jefferson
-
James Madison
-
Thomas Paine,
...none of whom were Masons, wanted to completely severe ties
with
the British Crown, but were overruled by the Masonic faction led by,
...who wanted to,
"defy Parliament but remain loyal to
the Crown".
St. Andrews Lodge was the hub of New World Masonry and began
issuing Knights Templar Degrees in 1769. [2]
General Joseph Warren
All US Masonic lodges are to this day warranted by the British Crown, whom
they serve as a global intelligence and counterrevolutionary subversion
network.
Their most recent initiative is the Masonic Child Identification
Program (CHIP). According to Wikipedia, the CHIP programs allow parents the
opportunity to create a kit of identifying materials for their child, free
of charge. The kit contains a fingerprint card, a physical description, a
video, computer disk, or DVD of the child, a dental imprint, and a DNA
sample.
The First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia in 1774 under the
Presidency of Peyton Randolph, who succeeded Washington as Grand Master of
the Virginia Lodge.
The Second Continental Congress convened in 1775 under
the Presidency of Freemason John Hancock. Peyton's brother William succeeded
him as Virginia Lodge Grand Master and became the leading proponent of
centralization and federalism at the First Constitutional Convention in
1787. The federalism at the heart of the US Constitution is identical to the
federalism laid out in the Freemason's Anderson's Constitutions of 1723.
William Randolph became the nation's first Attorney General and Secretary of
State under George Washington. His family returned to England loyal to the
Crown. John Marshall, the nation's first Supreme Court Justice, was also a
Mason. [3]
When Benjamin Franklin journeyed to France to seek financial help for
American revolutionaries, his meetings took place at Rothschild banks. He
brokered arms sales via German Mason Baron von Steuben. His Committees of
Correspondence operated through Freemason channels and paralleled a British
spy network.
In 1776 Franklin became de facto Ambassador to France.
In 1779
he became Grand Master of the French Neuf Soeurs (Nine Sisters) Lodge, to
which John Paul Jones and Voltaire belonged. Franklin was also a member of
the more secretive Royal Lodge of Commanders of the Temple West of
Carcasonne, whose members included Frederick Prince of Whales.
While
Franklin preached temperance in the US, he cavorted wildly with his Lodge
brothers in Europe. Franklin served as Postmaster General from the 1750's to
1775 - a role traditionally relegated to British spies. [4]
With Rothschild financing Alexander Hamilton founded two New York banks,
including Bank of New York. [5]
He died in a gun battle with Aaron Burr, who
founded Bank of Manhattan with Kuhn Loeb financing.
Hamilton exemplified the
contempt which the Eight Families hold towards common people, once stating,
"All communities divide themselves into the
few and the many. The first are the rich and the well born, the others
the mass of the people... The people are turbulent and changing; they
seldom judge and determine right. Give therefore to the first class a
distinct, permanent share of government. They will check the
unsteadiness of the second." [6]
Hamilton was only the first in a series of Eight Families cronies to hold
the key position of Treasury Secretary.
In recent times,
-
Kennedy Treasury
Secretary Douglas Dillon came from Dillon Read (now part of UBS Warburg)
-
Nixon Treasury Secretaries David Kennedy and William Simon came from
Continental Illinois Bank (now part of Bank of America) and Salomon Brothers
(now part of Citigroup), respectively
-
Carter Treasury Secretary Michael
Blumenthal came from Goldman Sachs
-
Reagan Treasury Secretary Donald Regan
came from Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America)
-
Bush Sr. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady came from Dillon Read (UBS Warburg)
-
both
Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Bush Jr. Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson came from Goldman Sachs
-
Obama Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner
worked at Kissinger Associates and the New York Fed
Thomas Jefferson argued that the United States needed a publicly-owned
central bank so that European monarchs and aristocrats could not use the
printing of money to control the affairs of the new nation.
Jefferson
extolled,
"A country which expects to remain ignorant
and free...expects that which has never been and that which will never
be. There is scarcely a King in a hundred who would not, if he could,
follow the example of Pharaoh - get first all the people's money, then
all their lands and then make them and their children servants
forever...banking establishments are more dangerous than standing
armies. Already they have raised up a money aristocracy."
Jefferson watched as the Euro-banking conspiracy to control
the United States unfolded, weighing in,
"Single acts of tyranny may be
ascribed to the accidental opinion of the day, but a series of oppressions
begun at a distinguished period, unalterable through every change of
ministers, too plainly prove a deliberate, systematic plan of reducing us to
slavery". [7]
But the Rothschild-sponsored Hamilton's arguments for a private US central
bank carried the day.
In 1791 the Bank of the United States (BUS) was
founded, with the Rothschilds as main owners. The bank's charter was to run
out in 1811. Public opinion ran in favor of revoking the charter and
replacing it with a Jeffersonian public central bank. The debate was
postponed as the nation was plunged by the Euro-bankers into the War of
1812.
Amidst a climate of fear and economic hardship, Hamilton's bank got
its charter renewed in 1816.
Old Hickory, Honest Abe & Camelot
In 1828 Andrew Jackson took a run at the US Presidency.
Throughout his
campaign he railed against the international bankers who controlled the BUS.
Jackson ranted,
"You are a den of vipers. I intend to expose you and by
Eternal God I will rout you out. If the people understood the rank
injustices of our money and banking system there would be a revolution
before morning."
Jackson won the election and revoked the bank's charter stating,
"The Act
seems to be predicated on an erroneous idea that the present shareholders
have a prescriptive right to not only the favor, but the bounty of the
government... for their benefit does this Act exclude the whole American
people from competition in the purchase of this monopoly.
Present
stockholders and those inheriting their rights as successors be established
a privileged order, clothed both with great political power and enjoying
immense pecuniary advantages from their connection with government.
Should
its influence be concentrated under the operation of such an Act as this, in
the hands of a self-elected directory whose interests are identified with
those of the foreign stockholders, will there not be cause to tremble for
the independence of our country in war... controlling our currency, receiving
our public monies and holding thousands of our citizens independence, it
would be more formidable and dangerous than the naval and military power of
the enemy.
It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend
the acts of government for selfish purposes... to make the rich richer and
more powerful. Many of our rich men have not been content with equal
protection and equal benefits, but have besought us to make them richer by
acts of Congress.
I have done my duty to this country." [8]
Populism prevailed and Jackson was re-elected. In 1835 he was the target of
an assassination attempt.
The gunman was Richard Lawrence, who confessed
that he was,
"in touch with the powers in Europe". [9]
Still, in 1836 Jackson refused to renew the BUS charter.
Under his watch the
US national debt went to zero for the first and last time in our nation's
history. This angered the international bankers, whose primary income is
derived from interest payments on debt. BUS President Nicholas Biddle cut
off funding to the US government in 1842, plunging the US into a depression.
Biddle was an agent for the Paris-based Jacob Rothschild. [10]
The Mexican War was simultaneously sprung on Jackson. A few years later the
Civil War was unleashed, with London bankers backing the Union and French
bankers backing the South. The Lehman family made a fortune smuggling arms
to the south and cotton to the north. By 1861 the US was $100 million in
debt. New President Abraham Lincoln snubbed the Euro-bankers again, issuing
Lincoln Greenbacks to pay Union Army bills.
The Rothschild-controlled Times of London wrote,
"If that mischievous
policy, which had its origins in the North American Republic, should become indurated down to a fixture, then that Government will furnish its own money
without cost. It will pay off its debts and be without debt. It will have
all the money necessary to carry on its commerce.
It will become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of the civilized governments of the world. The brains and
the wealth of all countries will go to North America. That government
must be destroyed, or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe." [11]
The Euro-banker-written Hazard Circular was exposed and circulated
throughout the country by angry populists.
It stated,
"The great debt that
capitalists will see is made out of the war and must be used to control the
valve of money. To accomplish this government bonds must be used as a
banking basis.
We are now awaiting Secretary of Treasury Salmon Chase to
make that recommendation. It will not allow Greenbacks to circulate as money
as we cannot control that. We control bonds and through them banking
issues".
The 1863 National Banking Act reinstated a private US central bank and
Chase's war bonds were issued.
Lincoln was re-elected the next year, vowing
to repeal the act after he took his January 1865 oaths of office. Before he
could act, he was assassinated at the Ford Theatre by John Wilkes Booth.
Booth had major connections to the international bankers. His granddaughter
wrote This One Mad Act, which details Booth's contact with "mysterious
Europeans" just before the Lincoln assassination.
Following the Lincoln hit, Booth was whisked away by members of a secret
society known as Knights of the Golden Circle (KGC). KGC had close ties to
the French Society of Seasons, which produced Karl Marx. KGC had fomented
much of the tension that caused the Civil War and President Lincoln had
specifically targeted the group.
Booth was a KGC member and was connected
through Confederate Secretary of State Judah Benjamin to the House of
Rothschild. Benjamin fled to England after the Civil War. [12]
Nearly a century after Lincoln was assassinated for issuing Greenbacks,
President John F. Kennedy found himself in the Eight Families' crosshairs.
Kennedy had announced a crackdown on off-shore tax havens and proposed
increases in tax rates on large oil and mining companies. He supported
eliminating tax loopholes which benefit the super-rich.
His economic
policies were publicly attacked by Fortune magazine, the Wall Street Journal
and both David and Nelson Rockefeller. Even Kennedy's own Treasury Secretary
Douglas Dillon, who came from the UBS Warburg-controlled Dillon Read
investment bank, voiced opposition to the JFK proposals. [13]
Kennedy's fate was sealed in June 1963 when he authorized the issuance of
more than $4 billion in United States Notes by his Treasury Department in an
attempt to circumvent the high interest rate usury of the private Federal
Reserve international banker crowd.
The wife of Lee Harvey Oswald, who was
conveniently gunned down by Jack Ruby before Ruby himself was shot, told
author A. J. Weberman in 1994,
"The answer to the Kennedy assassination is
with the Federal Reserve Bank. Don't underestimate that. It's wrong to blame
it on Angleton and the CIA per se only. This is only one finger on the same
hand. The people who supply the money are above the CIA". [14]
Fueled by incoming President Lyndon Johnson's immediate escalation of the
Vietnam War, the US sank further into debt. Its citizens were terrorized
into silence.
If they could kill the President they could kill anyone.
The House of Rothschild
The Dutch House of Orange founded the Bank of Amsterdam in 1609 as the
world's first central bank.
Prince William of Orange married into the
English House of Windsor, taking King James II's daughter Mary as his bride.
The Orange Order Brotherhood, which recently fomented Northern Ireland
Protestant violence, put William III on the English throne where he ruled
both Holland and Britain. In 1694 William III teamed up with the UK
aristocracy to launch the private Bank of England.
The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street - as the
Bank of England is known - is
surrounded by thirty foot walls. Three floors beneath it the third largest
stock of gold bullion in the world is stored. [15]
The Rothschilds and their inbred Eight Families partners gradually came to
control the Bank of England. The daily London gold "fixing" occurred at the
N. M. Rothschild Bank until 2004.
As Bank of England Deputy Governor George
Blunden put it,
"Fear is what makes the bank's powers so
acceptable. The bank is able to exert its influence when people are
dependent on us and fear losing their privileges or when they are
frightened." [16]
Mayer Amschel Rothschild sold the British government German Hessian
mercenaries to fight against American Revolutionaries, diverting the
proceeds to his brother Nathan in London, where N.M. (Nathan and Mayer)
Rothschild & Sons was established.
Mayer was a serious student of Cabala and
launched his fortune on money embezzled from William IX - royal administrator
of the Hesse-Kassel region and a prominent Freemason.
Rothschild-controlled
Barings bankrolled the Chinese opium and African slave
trades.
It financed the Louisiana Purchase. When several states defaulted on
its loans, Barings bribed Daniel Webster to make speeches stressing the
virtues of loan repayment. The states held their ground, so the House of
Rothschild cut off the money spigot in 1842, plunging the US into a deep
depression. It was often said that the wealth of the Rothschilds depended on
the bankruptcy of nations.
Mayer Amschel Rothschild once said,
"I care not
who controls a nation's political affairs, so long as I control her
currency".
War didn't hurt the family fortune either.
The House of Rothschild financed,
Nathan Rothschild made a huge financial bet on
Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, while also funding the Duke of
Wellington's peninsular campaign against Napoleon.
Both the Mexican War and
the Civil War were goldmines for the family.
Nathan Rothschild
One Rothschild family biography mentions a London meeting where an
"International Banking Syndicate" decided to pit the American North against
the South as part of a "divide and conquer" strategy.
German Chancellor Otto
von Bismarck once stated,
"The division of the United States into
federations of equal force was decided long before the Civil War. These
bankers were afraid that the United States... would upset their
financial domination over the world. The voice of the Rothschilds
prevailed."
Rothschild biographer Derek Wilson says the family was the official European
banker to the US government and strong supporters of the Bank of the United
States. [17]
Family biographer Niall Ferguson notes a "substantial and unexplained gap"
in private Rothschild correspondence between 1854-1860.
He says all copies
of outgoing letters written by the London Rothschilds during this Civil War
period,
"were destroyed at the orders of successive partners".
[18]
French and British troops had, at the height of the Civil War, encircled the
US.
The British sent 11,000 troops to Crown-controlled Canada, which gave
safe harbor to Confederate agents. France's Napoleon III installed Austrian
Hapsburg family member Archduke Maximilian as his puppet emperor in Mexico,
where French troops massed on the Texas border.
Only an 11th-hour deployment
of two Russian warship fleets by US ally Czar Alexander II in 1863 saved the
United States from re-colonization. [19]
That same year the Chicago Tribune blasted,
"Belmont (August Belmont was a US Rothschild
agent and had a Triple Crown horse race named in his honor) and the
Rothschilds... who have been buying up Confederate war bonds."
Salmon Rothschild said of a deceased President Lincoln,
"He rejects all forms of compromise. He has
the appearance of a peasant and can only tell barroom stories."
Baron Jacob Rothschild was equally flattering towards the
US citizenry.
He once commented to US Minister to Belgium Henry Sanford on
the over half a million Americans who died during the Civil War,
"When your patient is desperately sick, you
try desperate measures, even to bloodletting."
Salmon and Jacob were merely carrying forth a family
tradition. A few generations earlier Mayer Amschel Rothschild bragged of his
investment strategy,
"When the streets of Paris are running in blood, I
buy". [20]
Mayer Rothschild's sons were known as the
Frankfurt Five.
-
The eldest - Amschel - ran the family's Frankfurt bank with his father
-
Nathan ran
London operations
-
Youngest son Jacob set up shop in Paris
-
Salomon
ran the Vienna branch
-
Karl was off to Naples
Author Frederick Morton
estimates that by 1850 the Rothschilds were worth over $10 billion. [21]
Some researchers believe that their fortune today exceeds $100 trillion.
The,
-
Warburgs
-
Kuhn Loebs
-
Goldman Sachs
-
Schiffs
-
Rothschilds,
...have
intermarried into one big happy banking family.
The Warburg family - which
controls Deutsche Bank and BNP - tied up with the Rothschilds in 1814 in
Hamburg, while Kuhn Loeb powerhouse Jacob Schiff shared quarters with
Rothschilds in 1785.
Schiff immigrated to America in 1865. He joined forces
with Abraham Kuhn and married Solomon Loeb's daughter. Loeb and Kuhn married
each others sisters and the Kuhn Loeb dynasty was consummated. Felix Warburg
married Jacob Schiff's daughter. Two Goldman daughters married two sons of
the Sachs family, creating Goldman Sachs. In 1806 Nathan Rothschild married
the oldest daughter of Levi Barent Cohen, a leading financier in London.
[22]
Thus, Merrill Lynch super-bull Abby Joseph Cohen and Clinton Secretary
of Defense William Cohen are likely descended from Rothschilds.
Today the Rothschild's control a far-flung financial empire, which includes
majority stakes in most world central banks. The Edmond de Rothschild clan
owns the Banque Privee SA in Lugano, Switzerland and the Rothschild Bank AG
of Zurich. The family of Jacob Lord Rothschild owns the powerful Rothschild
Italia in Milan.
They are founding members of the exclusive $10 trillion
Club of the Isles - which controls corporate giants,
It dominates the
world supply of petroleum, gold, diamonds, and many other vital raw
materials. [23]
The Club of the Isles provides capital for
George Soros' Quantum Fund NV - which made substantial financial gains in 1998-99 following the collapse of
currencies of Thailand, Indonesia and Russia. Soros was a major shareholder
at George W. Bush's Harken Energy.
The Club of Isles is led by the Rothschilds and includes Queen Elizabeth II and other wealthy European
aristocrats and Nobility.[24]
Perhaps the largest repository for Rothschild wealth today is Rothschilds
Continuation Holdings AG - a secretive Swiss-based bank holding company. By
the late 1990s scions of the Rothschild global empire were Barons Guy and Elie de Rothschild in France and Lord Jacob and Sir Evelyn Rothschild in
Britain. [25]
Evelyn was chairman of the Economist and a director at DeBeers and IBM UK.
Jacob backed Arnold Schwarzenegger's California gubernatorial campaign. He
took control of Khodorkovsky's YUKOS oil shares just before the Russian
government arrested him. In 2010 Jacob joined Rupert Murdoch in a shale oil
extraction partnership in Israel through Genie Energy - a subsidiary of IDT
Corporation. [26]
Within months, Sarah Palin had hired former IDT executive Michael Glassner
as her chief of staff. [27]
Is Palin the Rothschild choice in 2012?

Part 3
The Roundtable and The Illuminati
June 14, 2011
from
DeanHerdersonWordPress Website
According to former British intelligence agent
John Coleman's book,
The Committee of 300, the Rothschilds exert
political control through the secretive Business Roundtable, which they
created in 1909 with the help of Lord Alfred Milner and South African
industrialist
Cecil Rhodes.
The Rhodes Scholarship is granted by Cambridge
University, out of which oil industry propagandist Cambridge Energy Research
Associates operates.
Rhodes founded De Beers and Standard Chartered Bank. According to Gary
Allen's expose,
The Rockefeller File, Milner financed the
Russian Bolsheviks on Rothschild's behalf, with help from Jacob Schiff and
Max Warburg.
In 1917 British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour penned a letter to Zionist
Second Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild in which he expressed support for a
Jewish homeland on Palestinian-controlled lands in the Middle East. [1]
The Balfour Declaration justified the brutal seizure of Palestinian lands
for the post-WWII establishment of Israel. Israel would serve, not as some
high-minded "Jewish homeland", but as lynchpin in Rothschild/Eight Families
control over the world's oil supply. Baron
Edmond de Rothschild built the first oil
pipeline from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean to bring BP Iranian oil to
Israel.
He founded Israeli General Bank and Paz Oil. He
is considered by many the father of modern Israel. [2]
Roundtable inner Circle of Initiates included,
-
Lord Milner
-
Cecil Rhodes
-
Arthur Balfour
-
Albert Grey
-
Lord Nathan Rothschild
The Roundtable takes its name from the legendary
knight of King Arthur, whose tale of the Holy Grail is paramount to
the Illuminati notion of Sangreal or holy blood.
John Coleman writes in The Committee of 300,
"Round Tablers armed with immense wealth
from gold, diamond and drug monopolies fanned out throughout the world
to take control of fiscal and monetary policies and political leadership
in all countries where they operated."
While Cecil Rhodes and the Oppenheimers went to
South Africa, the Kuhn Loebs were off to re-colonize America.
Rudyard Kipling was sent to India. The Schiffs
and Warburgs manhandled Russia. The Rothschilds, Lazards and Israel Moses
Seifs pushed into the Middle East. In Princeton, New Jersey the Round Table
founded the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) as partner to its All
Souls College at Oxford.
In 1919 Rothschild's Business Roundtable spawned the Royal Institute of
International Affairs (RIIA) in London.
The RIIA soon sponsored sister
organizations around the globe, including
-
the US Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)
-
the Asian Institute of Pacific Relations
-
the Canadian Institute of International
Affairs
-
the Brussels-based Institute des
Relations Internationales
-
the Danish Foreign Policy Society
-
the Indian Council of World Affairs
-
the Australian Institute of
International Affairs
Other affiliates popped up in France, Turkey,
Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece. [4]
The RIIA is a registered charity of the
Queen and, according to its annual reports, is funded largely by the Four
Horsemen. Former British Foreign Secretary and Kissinger Associates
co-founder Lord Carrington was President of both the RIIA and the
Bilderbergers.
The inner circle at RIIA is dominated by,
The Knights of St. John were founded in 1070 and
answer directly to the British House of Windsor. Their leading bloodline is
the Villiers dynasty, which the Hong Kong Matheson family married into. The
Lytton family also married into the Villiers gang. [5]
Colonel Edward Bulwer-Lytton led the English Rosicrucian secret
society, which Shakespeare opaquely referred to as Rosencranz, while the
Freemasons took the role of Guildenstern. Lytton was spiritual father of
both the RIIA and Nazi fascism.
In 1871 he penned a novel titled,
Vril: The
Power of the Coming Race.
Seventy years later the
Vril Society received ample mention in Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.
Lytton's son became Viceroy to India in 1876 just before opium production
spiked in that country. Lytton's good friend Rudyard Kipling worked under
Lord Beaverbrook as Propaganda Minister, alongside Sir Charles Hambro of the
Hambros banking dynasty. [6]
James Bruce, ancestor to Scottish Rite Freemason founder Sir Robert the
Bruce, was the 8th Earl of Elgin.
He supervised the Caribbean slave trade as
Jamaican Governor General from 1842-1846. He was Britain's Ambassador to
China during the Second Opium War. His brother Frederick was Colonial
Secretary of Hong Kong during both
Opium
Wars. Both were prominent Freemasons. British Lord Palmerston,
who ran the Opium Wars, was a blood relative of the Bruce monarchy, as was
his Foreign Secretary John Russell, grandfather of Bertrand Russell.
[7]
Children of the Roundtable elite are members of a Dionysian cult known as
Children of the Sun.
Initiates include,
-
Aldous Huxley
-
T. S. Eliot
-
D. H. Lawrence
-
H. G. Wells
Wells headed British intelligence during WWI.
His books speak of a "one-world brain" and "a
police of the mind". William Butler Yeats, another Sun member, was a pal of
Aleister Crowley. The two formed an Isis Cult based on a Madam Blavatsky
manuscript, which called on the British aristocracy to organize itself into
an Isis Aryan priesthood. Most prominent writers of English literature came
from the ranks of the Roundtable. All promoted Empire expansion, however
subtly.
Blavatsky's Theosophical Society and
Bulwer-Lytton's Rosicrucians joined forces to form
the Thule
Society out of which the Nazis emerged. [8]
Aleister Crowley formed the British parallel to the Thule
Society, the Isis-Urania Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He tutored LSD
guru Aldus Huxley, who arrived in the US in 1952, the same year the CIA
launched its
MK-ULTRA mind control program with help
from the Warburg-owned Swiss Sandoz Laboratories and Rockefeller cousin
Allen Dulles-OSS Station Chief in Berne.
Dulles received information from the
Muslim Brotherhood House of Saudi regarding
the creation of mind-controlled Assassins. Dulles' assistant was James
Warburg. [9]
The Atlantic Union (AU) was an RIIA affiliate founded by Cecil Rhodes- who
dreamed of returning the US to the British Crown. In 1939 AU set up its
first offices in America in space donated by Nelson Rockefeller at 10 E 40th
St in New York City. Every year from 1949-1976 an AU resolution was floored
in Congress calling for a repeal of the Declaration of Independence and a
"new world order".
Another RIIA affiliate was United World
Federalists (UWF) - founded by Norman Cousins and Dulles assistant James P.
Warburg. UWF's motto was "One world or none". Its first president Cord
Meyer stepped down to take a key position in Allen Dulles' CIA.
Meyer articulated UWF's goal,
"Once having joined the One-World Federated
Government, no nation could secede or revolt...with the atom bomb in its
possession the Federal Government would blow that nation off the face of
the earth." [10]
In 1950 James Warburg, whose elders Max and Paul
sat on the board of Nazi business combine
IG Farben, testified before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee,
"We shall have world government whether or
not you like it- by conquest or consent."
The AU and UAF are close to
the
CFR and
the Trilateral Commission (TC) - founded by
David Rockefeller and
Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1974. [11]
The TC published The Triangle Papers which extended the "special
relationship between the US and Western Europe" to include Japan, which was
fast becoming creditor to the rest of the world. Former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker was TC Chairman.
TC/CFR insider Harvard Professor Samuel
Huntington, who most recently has argued for a "Clash of Civilizations"
between the West and the Muslim world, wrote in the TC publication Crisis in
Democracy,
"...a government which lacks authority will
have little ability short of cataclysmic crisis to impose on its people
the sacrifices which may be necessary." [12]
The Illuminati
The Illuminati serves as ruling council to
all secret societies.
Its roots go back to:
-
the Guardians of Light in Atlantis
-
the
Brotherhood of the Snake in Sumeria
-
the Afghan Roshaniya
-
the Egyptian Mystery Schools
-
the Genoese families who bankrolled the
Roman Empire
British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli,
who "handled" mafia-founder and 33rd Degree Mason Guiseppe
Mazzini, alluded to the Illuminati in a speech before the House of
Commons in 1856 warning,
"There is in Italy a power which we seldom
mention. I mean the secret societies. Europe...is covered with a network
of secret societies just as the surfaces of the earth are covered with a
network of railroads." [13]
The Illuminati is to these secret societies what
the Bank of International Settlements is to the Eight Families central
bankers. And their constituencies are exactly the same.
The forerunners of the Freemasons -the Knights Templar- founded the concept
of banking and created a bond market as a means to control European nobles
through war debts. By the 13th century the Templars had used
their looted Crusades gold to buy 9,000 castles throughout Europe and ran an
empire stretching from Copenhagen to Damascus.
They founded modern banking techniques and
legitimized usury via interest payments.
Templars' bank branches popped up everywhere,
backed by their ill-gotten gold. They charged up to 60% interest on loans,
launched the concept of trust accounts and introduced a credit card system
for Holy Land pilgrims. They acted as tax collectors, though themselves
exempted by Roman authorities, and built the great cathedrals of Europe,
having also found instructions regarding secret building techniques
alongside the gold they pilfered beneath Solomon's Temple.
The stained glass used in the cathedrals
resulted from a secret Gothic technique known by few. One who had perfected
this art was Omar Khayvam, a good friend of
Assassin founder Hasan bin Sabah. [14]
The Templars controlled a huge fleet of
ships and their own naval fleet based at the French Atlantic Port of La
Rochelle. They were especially cozy with the royals of England. They
purchased the island of Cyprus from Richard the Lion Heart, but were later
overrun by the Turks. On Friday October 13, 1307 King Philip IV of France
joined forces with Pope Clement V and began rounding up Templars on charges
ranging from necromancy to the use of black magic. Friday the 13th
would from that day forward carry negative connotations.
"Sion" is believed to be a transliteration of
Zion, itself a transliteration for the ancient Hebrew name Jerusalem.
The
Priory of Sion came into public view in
July 1956. A 1981 notice in the French press listed 121 dignitaries as
Priory members. All were bankers, royalty or members of the international
political jet set.
Pierre Plantard was listed as Grand
Master. Plantard is a direct descendent, through King Dagobert II, of
the
Merovingan Kings. Plantard, who owns property in the
Rennes-le-Chateau area of southern France
where the Priory of Sion is based, has stated that the order has in its
possession lost treasure recovered from beneath Solomon's Temple and that it
will be returned to Israel when the time is right. He also stated that in
the near future monarchy would be restored to France and other nations.
The Templars claim to possess secret knowledge
that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene, fathered children to launch
the Merovingan bloodline and was the son of Joseph of Arimathea. [15]
Joseph was the son of King Solomon. Solomon's Temple is the model for
Masonic Temples, which occur without fail in every town of any size in
America. It was a place of ill repute where fornicating, drunkenness and
human sacrifice were the norm.
Accorder to British researcher
David
Icke, it's location on Jerusalem's Mount Moriah may have also
been an Anunnaki flight control center.
The Anunnaki are the reptilian/aliens
revealed by the Sumerian clay tablets - the oldest written accounts of
humankind known.
The Crusader Knights Templar looted their huge store of
gold and numerous sacred artifacts from beneath the Temple. King Solomon was
the son of King David- who during his 1015 BC reign massacred thousands of
people.
Icke calls King David "a butcher" and asserts that the king wrote a good
chunk of the Bible. His son Solomon killed his own brother to become King.
He advised Egyptian Pharaoh Shiskak I, marrying his daughter. Solomon
studied at Akhenaton's Egyptian Mystery Schools, where mind control
was rampant. The Grand Lodge of Cairo spawned a network of secret societies
including Assassins, Cabalists, Freemasons and the Afghan Roshaniya. Those
who pass through to the highest levels become Illuminati.
Icke claims the Canaanite Brotherhood was headed by the god/king
Melchizedek, who may have been an Anunnaki.
The King focused on a Hebrew understanding of
the Ancient Mysteries. The Order of Melchizedek became the secret
society associated with the Cabala. King Solomon developed his vast wisdom
studying the Sumerian Tables of Destiny which Abraham had possessed. Abraham
may have also been of Anunnaki origin.
Both he and Melchizedek had been tutored by the Sumerian Brotherhood of the
Snake, whose name may have something to do with the Biblical creation story,
where Adam and Eve are tempted from a bountiful garden of Eden (a hunting
and gathering existence?) into a world of "sin and servitude" by a snake.
When the Bible says that the first couple ate the forbidden fruit, could it
mean that Eve was impregnated by the snake - an Anunnaki serpent (the
Nephilim of the Book of Genesis) - thus damning all Adamus to a
life of toil under serpent king bloodline control?
The basis of the Sumerian Tables of Destiny which Abraham possessed became
known as Ha Qabala, Hebrew for "light and knowledge".
Those who understood these cryptic secrets, said
to be encoded throughout the Old Testament, are referred to deferentially as
Ram. The phrase is used in Celtic, Buddhist and Hindu spiritual circles as
well. The Knights Templar brought Cabbalistic knowledge to Europe when they
returned from their Middle East Crusade adventures. [16]
The Knights created the Prieure de Sion on Mt. Zion near Jerusalem in the 11th
century to guard such holy relics as the Shroud of Turin, the Ark of the
Covenant and the Hapsburg family's Spear of Destiny - which was used to
'kill' Jesus Christ. The Priory's more important purpose was to guard
Templar gold and to preserve the alleged bloodline of Jesus - the
royal Sangreal - which they believe is carried forth by the French Bourbon
Merovingian family and the related Hapsburg monarchs of Spain and Austria.
[17]
The French Lorraine dynasty, which descended
from the Merovingans, married into the House of Hapsburg to acquire the
throne of Austria.
The Hapsburgs ran the Holy Roman Empire until its dissolution in 1806,
through King Charles V and others. The family traces its roots back to a
Swiss estate known as Habichtburg, which was built in 1020. The Hapsburgs
are an integral part of the Priory of Sion. Many researchers believe that
Spain's Hapsburg King Philip will be crowned Sangreal World King in
Jerusalem. The Hapsburgs are related to the Rothschilds through Holy Roman
Emperor Frederick Barbarossa's second son Archibald II.
The Rothschilds - leaders in Cabala, Freemasonry and the Knights Templar - sit
at the apex of the both the Illuminati and the Eight Families banking
cartel.
The family accumulated its vast wealth issuing war bonds to
Black
Nobility for centuries, including,
The Eight Families have also intermarried with these
royals.
Author David Icke believes the Rothschilds represent the head of the
Anunnaki Serpent Kings, stating,
"They (Rothschilds) had the crown heads of
Europe in debt to them and this included the Black Nobility dynasty, the
Hapsburgs, who ruled the Holy Roman Empire for 600 years. The
Rothschilds also control the Bank of England. If there was a war, the
Rothschilds were behind the scenes, creating conflict and funding both
sides." [18]
The Rothschilds and the Warburgs are main stockholders of the German
Bundesbank.
Rothschilds control Japan's biggest banking house
Nomura
Securities via a tie-up between Edmund Rothschild and Tsunao Okumura. The
Rothschilds are the richest and most powerful family in the world. They are
also inbred. According to several family biographers, over half of the last
generation of Rothschild progeny married within the family, presumably to
preserve their Sangreal. [19]
The 1782
Great Seal of the United States is loaded with Illuminati
symbolism. So is the reverse side of the US $1 Federal Reserve Note, which
was designed by Freemasons. The pyramid on the left side represents those in
Egypt- possibly space beacon/energy source to the Anunnaki- whose Pharaohs
oversaw the building of the pyramids using slave labor.
The pyramid is an important symbol for the Illuminati bankers.
They employ
Triads, Trilaterals and Trinities to create a society ruled by an elite
Sangreal few presiding over the masses - as represented by a pyramid. The
Brotherhood of the Snake worshiped a Trinity of Isis, Osirus and Horus - who
may have been Anunnaki offspring.
The Brotherhood spread the concept of
Trinity to,
-
Christian (Father, Son and Holy Spirit)
-
Hindu (Brahma, Shiva and
Krishna)
-
Buddhist (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha)
faiths [20]
The reptilian eye atop the pyramid depicted on the $1 bill is the all-seeing
eye of the Afghan
Roshaniya, known alternately as The Order and
Order of the
Quest - names adopted by
Skull & Bones, Germanorden and the JASON Society.
[21]
Take a magnifying glass and look at the eye's pupil. There
is an image of an alien inside the pupil. I'm not kidding.
Novus Ordo Seclorum appears beneath the pyramid, while Annuit Coeptis
appears above the all-seeing eye. Annuit Coeptis means "may he smile upon
our endeavors (Great Work of Ages)".
Above the eagle on the right side of
the note are the words E Pluribus Unum, Latin for "out of many one". The
eagle clutches 13 arrows and 13 olive branches, while 13 stars appear above

Part 4
A Financial Parasite
June 19, 2011
United World Federalists founder James Warburg's father was Paul Warburg,
who financed Hitler with help from Brown Brothers Harriman partner Prescott
Bush. [1]
Colonel Ely Garrison was a close friend of both President Teddy Roosevelt
and President Woodrow Wilson.
Garrison wrote in Roosevelt, Wilson and the
Federal Reserve,
"Paul Warburg was the man who got the
Federal Reserve Act together after the Aldrich Plan aroused such
nationwide resentment and opposition. The mastermind of both plans was
Baron Alfred Rothschild of London."
The Aldrich Plan was hatched at a secret 1910 meeting at JP Morgan's private
resort on Jekyl Island, SC between Rockefeller lieutenant Nelson Aldrich and
Paul Warburg of the German Warburg banking dynasty.
Aldrich, a New York
congressman, later married into
the Rockefeller family. His son Winthrop
Aldrich chaired Chase Manhattan Bank. While the bankers met, Colonel Edward
House, another Rockefeller stooge and close confidant of President Woodrow
Wilson, was busy convincing Wilson of the importance of a private central
bank and the introduction of a national income tax.
A member of House's
staff was British MI6 Permindex insider General Julius Klein. [2]
Wilson didn't need much convincing, since he was beholden to copper magnate
Cleveland Dodge, whose namesake Phelps Dodge became one of the biggest
mining companies in the world. Dodge bankrolled Wilson's political career.
Wilson even wrote his inaugural speech on Dodge's yacht. [3]
Wilson was a classmate of both Dodge and Cyrus McCormick at Princeton. Both
were directors at Rockefeller's National City Bank (now Citigroup).
Wilson's
main focus was on overcoming public distrust of the bankers, which New York
City Mayor John Hylan echoed in 1922 when he argued,
"The real menace to our
republic is the invisible government which, like a giant octopus, sprawls
its slimy length over our city, state and nation. At the head is a small
group of banking houses, generally referred to as the international
bankers". [4]
But the
Eight Families prevailed.
In 1913 the
Federal Reserve Bank was born,
with Paul Warburg its first Governor. Four years later the US entered World
War I, after a secret society known as the Black Hand assassinated Archduke
Ferdinand and his Hapsburg wife.
The Archduke's friend Count Czerin later
said,
"A year before the war he informed me that
the Masons had resolved upon his death." [5]
That same year, Bolsheviks overthrew the Hohehzollern monarchy in Russia
with help from Max Warburg and Jacob Schiff, while the Balfour Declaration
leading to the creation of Israel was penned to Zionist Second Lord
Rothschild.
In the 1920's Baron Edmund de Rothschild founded the Palestine Economics
Commission, while Kuhn Loeb's Manhattan offices helped Rothschild form a
network to smuggle weapons to Zionist death squads bent on seizing
Palestinian lands. General Julius Klein oversaw the operation and headed the
US Army Counterintelligence Corps, which later produced
Henry Kissinger.
Klein diverted Marshall Plan aid to Europe to Zionist terror cells in
Palestine after WWII, channeling the funds through the Sonneborn Institute,
which was controlled by Baltimore chemical magnate Rudolph Sonneborn.
His
wife Dorothy Schiff is related to the Warburgs. [6]
The Kuhn Loebs came to Manhattan with the Warburgs. At the same time the
Bronfmans came to Canada as part of the Moses Montefiore Jewish Colonization
Committee.
-
The Montefiores have carried out the dirty work of Genoese
nobility since the 13th Century.
-
The di Spadaforas served that function for
the Italian House of Savoy, which was bankrolled by the Israel Moses Seif
family for which Israel is named.
-
Lord Harold Sebag Montefiore is current
head of the Jerusalem Foundation, the Zionist wing of the Knights of St.
John's Jerusalem.
The Bronfmans (the name means "liquorman" in Yiddish) tied
up with Arnold Rothstein, a product of the Rothschild's dry goods empire, to
found organized crime in New York City.
Rothstein was succeeded by Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Robert Vesco and Santos Trafficante. The Bronfmans
are intermarried with the Rothschilds, Loebs and Lamberts. [7]
The year 1917 also saw the 16th Amendment added to the US Constitution,
levying a national income tax, though it was ratified by only two of the
required 36 states. The IRS is a private corporation registered in Delaware.
[8]
Four years earlier the Rockefeller Foundation was launched,
to shield family wealth from the new income tax provisions, while steering
public opinion through social engineering. One of its tentacles was the
General Education Board.
In Occasional Letter #1 the Board states,
"In our dreams we have limitless
resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our
molding hands. The present education conventions fade from their minds and,
unhampered by tradition, we will work our own good will upon a grateful and
responsive rural folk.
We shall try not to make these people or any
of their children into philosophers or men of learning or men of
science
of whom we have ample supply." [9]
Though most Americans think of the Federal Reserve as a government
institution, it is privately held by the Eight Families. The Secret Service
is employed, not by the Executive Branch, but by
the Federal Reserve.
[10]
An exchange between Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Fed Chairman Paul Volcker
at Senate hearings in 1982 is instructive. Kennedy must have thought of his
older brother John when he told Volcker that if he were before the committee
as a member of US Treasury things would be much different.
Volcker, puffing
on a cigar, responded cavalierly,
"That's probably true. But I believe it
was intentionally designed this way". [11]
Rep. Lee Hamilton
(D-IN) put it to Volcker that,
"People realize that what that board of
yours does has a very profound impact on their pocketbooks, and yet it
is a group of people basically inaccessible to them and unaccountable to
them."
President Wilson spoke of,
"a power so organized, so complete, so
pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breaths when they
speak in condemnation of it."
Rep. Charles Lindberg (D-NY) was more blunt, railing
against Wilson's Federal Reserve Act, which had cleverly been dubbed the "People's Bill".
Lindberg declared that the Act would,
"
establish the most
gigantic trust on earth
When the president signs this act, the invisible
government by the money power will be legitimized. The law will create
inflation whenever the trusts want inflation. From now on, depressions will
be scientifically created.
The invisible government by the money power,
proven to exist by the Money Trust Investigation, will be legalized. The
whole central bank concept was engineered by the very group it was supposed
to strip of power". [12]
The Fed is made up of most every bank in the US, but the New York Federal
Reserve Bank controls the Fed by virtue of its enormous capital resources.
The true center of power within the Fed is the
Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC), on which only the NY Fed President holds a permanent voting seat.
The FOMC issues directives on monetary policy which are implemented from the
8th Floor of the NY Fed, a fortress modeled after the Bank of England.
[13]
In the fifth sub-basement of the 14-story stone hulk lie 10,300 tons of
mostly non-US gold, 1/3 of the world's gold reserves and by far the largest
gold stock in the world. [14]
The world of money is increasingly computerized. With the introduction by
the Eight Families of complicated financial instruments like derivatives,
options, puts and futures; the volume of inter-bank transactions took a
quantum leap. To handle this the fed built a superhighway eerily known as
CHIPS (Clearing House Interbank Payment System), which is based in New York and
modeled after Morgan's Belgium-based
Euro-Clear - also known as The Beast.
When the Fed was created five New York banks,
-
Citibank
-
Chase
-
Chemical
Bank
-
Manufacturers Hanover
-
Bankers Trust,
...held a 43% stake in the New
York Fed.
By 1983 these same five banks owned 53% of the NY Fed. By year
2000, the newly merged Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank combines
owned even bigger chunks, as did the European faction of the Eight Families.
Collectively they own majority stock in every Fortune 500 corporation and do
the bulk of stock and bond trading. In 1955 the above five banks accounted
for 15% of all stock trades.
By 1985 they were involved in 85% of all stock
transactions. [15]
Still more powerful are the investment banks which bear the names of many of
the Eight Families.
In 1982, while Morgan bankers presided over negotiations
between Britain and Argentina after the Falklands War, President Reagan
pushed through SEC Rule 415, which helped consolidate securities
underwriting in the hands of six large investment houses owned by the Eight
Families:
-
Goldman Sachs
-
Merrill Lynch
-
Morgan Stanley
-
Salomon Brothers
-
First Boston
-
Lehman Brothers
These banks further consolidated their
power via the merger mania of 1980s and 1990s.
American Express swallowed up both Lehman Brothers-Kuhn Loeb - which had
merged in 1977 - and Shearson Lehman-Rhoades. The Israel Moses Seif's Banca
de la Svizzera Italiana bought a 7% stake in Lehman Brothers. [16]
Salomon Brothers nabbed Philbro from the South African Oppenheimer family,
then bought Smith Barney. All three then became part of Traveler's Group,
headed by Sandy Weill of the David-Weill family, which controls Lazard
Freres through senior partner Michel David-Weill. Citibank then bought
Travelers to form Citigroup.
S.G. Warburg, of which Oppenheimer's Chartered
Consolidated owns a 9% stake, joined the old money Banque Paribas - which
merged into Merrill Lynch in 1984. Union Bank of Switzerland acquired Paine
Webber, while Morgan Stanley ate up Dean Witter and purchased Discover
credit card operations from Sears.
Kuhn Loeb-controlled First Boston merged with Credit Suisse, which had
already absorbed White-Weld, to become CS First Boston- the major player in
the dirty London Eurobond market. Merrill Lynch - merged into Bank of
America in 2008 - is the major player on the US side of this trade.
Swiss
Banking Corporation merged with London's biggest investment house S.G.
Warburg to create SBC Warburg, while Warburg became more intertwined with
Merrill Lynch through their 1998 Mercury Assets tie up. The Warburg's formed
another venture with Union Bank of Switzerland, creating powerhouse UBS
Warburg.
Deutsche Bank bought Banker's Trust and Alex Brown to briefly
become the world's largest bank with $882 billion in assets. With repeal of
Glass-Steagal, the line between investment, commercial and private banking
disappeared.
This handful of investment banks exerts an enormous amount of control over
the global economy.
Their activities include advising Third World debt
negotiations, handling mergers and breakups, creating companies to fill a
perceived economic void through the launching of initial public stock
offerings (IPOs), underwriting all stocks, underwriting all corporate and
government bond issuance, and pulling the bandwagon down the road of
privatization and globalization of the world economy.
A recent president of the World Bank was James Wolfensohn of Salomon Smith
Barney. Merrill Lynch had $435 billion in assets in 1994, before the merger
frenzy had really even gotten under way. The biggest commercial bank at the
time, Citibank, could claim only $249 billion in assets.
In 1991,
Morgan Stanley did $60 billion in corporate
mergers in 1989.
By 2007, reflecting the repeal of Glass-Steagel, the top
ten NMA advisers in order were:
-
Goldman Sachs
-
Morgan Stanley
-
Citigroup
-
JP
Morgan Chase
-
Lehman Brothers
-
Merrill Lynch
-
UBS Warburg
-
Credit Suisse
-
Deutsche Bank
-
Lazard
In the IPO stock underwriting field for 1991 the
top four were Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and CS First
Boston.
In the arena of global privatization for years 1985-1995,
-
Goldman
Sachs led the way doing $13.3 billion worth of deals
-
UBS Warburg did $8.2 billion
-
BNP Paribas $6.8 billion
-
CS First Boston $4.9 billion
-
Paribas-owner Merrill Lynch $4.4 billion
[17]
In 2006 BNP Paribas bought the notorious Banca Nacionale de Lavoro (BNL),
which led the charge in arming Saddam Hussein. According to Global Finance,
it is now the world's largest bank with nearly $3 trillion in assets.
The leading US debt underwriters for the first nine months of 1995 bore the
same familiar names. Merrill Lynch underwrote $74.2 billion in the US debt
markets, or 15.3% of the total. Lehman Brothers handled $52.5 billion,
Morgan Stanley $47.4 billion, Salomon Smith Barney $45.6 billion. CS First
Boston, Chase Manhattan and Goldman Sachs rounded out the top seven.
The top
three municipal debt underwriters that year were,
-
Goldman Sachs
-
Merrill
Lynch
-
UBS Paine Webber
In the euro-market the top four underwriters in
1995 were,
-
UBS Warburg
-
Merrill Lynch
-
Deutsche Bank
-
Goldman Sachs
[18]
Deutsche Bank's Morgan Grenfell branch engineered the corporate
takeover binge in Europe.
The dominant players in the oil futures markets at both the New York
Mercantile Exchange and the London Petroleum Exchange are Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, Goldman Sachs (through its J. Aron & Company subsidiary),
Citigroup (through its Philbro unit) and Deutsche Bank (through its Banker's
Trust acquisition).
In 2002 Enron Online was auctioned off by a bankruptcy
court to UBS Warburg for $0. UBS was to share monopoly Enron Online profits
with Lehman Brothers after the first two years of the deal. [19]
With Lehman's 2008 demise, its new owner Barclays will get their cut.
Following the Lehman Brothers fiasco and the ensuing financial meltdown of
2008, the Four Horsemen of Banking got even bigger.
For pennies on the
dollar,
-
JP Morgan Chase was handed Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual
-
Bank
of America commandeered Merrill Lynch and Countrywide
-
Wells Fargo
seized control over the reeling #5 US bank Wachovia
-
Barclays got a sweetheart deal for the
remains of Lehman Brothers
Former House Banking Committee Chairman Wright Patman (D-TX), declared of
Federal Reserve Eight Families owners,
"The United States today has in
effect two governments. We are the duly constituted government. Then we have
an independent, uncontrolled and uncoordinated government in the Federal
Reserve System, operating the money powers which are reserved to Congress by
the Constitution". [20]
Since the creation of the Federal Reserve, US debt (mostly owed to the Eight
Families) has skyrocketed from $1 billion to nearly $14 trillion today.
This
far surpasses the total of all Third World country debt combined, debt which
is mostly owed to these same Eight Families, who own most all the world's
central banks.
As Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) pointed out,
"International bankers make money by
extending credit to governments. The greater the debt of the political
state, the larger the interest returned to lenders. The national banks
of Europe are (also) owned and controlled by private interests. We
recognize in a hazy sort of way that the Rothschilds and the Warburgs of
Europe and the houses of JP Morgan, Kuhn Loeb & Co., Schiff, Lehman and
Rockefeller possess and control vast wealth. How they acquire this vast
financial power and employ it is a mystery to most of us." [21]

Part 5
The Solution
June 26, 2011
Thomas Jefferson opined of the Rothschild-led
Eight Families central banking cartel which came to control the United
States,
"Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of
the day, but a series of oppressions begun at a distinguished period,
unalterable through every change of ministers, too plainly prove a
deliberate, systematic plan of reducing us to slavery".
Two centuries and a few decades later this same cabal of trillionaire money
changers - mysteriously immune from their own calls for "broad sacrifice" -
utilizes the debt lever to ring concessions from the people of,
In their never-ending quest to subjugate the planet, the bankers' IMF
enforcer - chronic harasser of Third World governments - has turned its
sites on the developed world.
To further advance their dizzying
concentration of economic power, the whining banksters take a giant wrecking
ball to the global middle class as they prepare to eat their young.
No one can argue that the US deficit is not a problem. Much of it accrues
paying interest on the $14 trillion debt. Stooped-over Congressional cartel
shills with names like Cantor and Boehner argue for slashing entire
government departments to satiate the bloodthirsty bond-holders. Liberals
argue for higher taxes on the rich and massive Pentagon cuts.
I agree with these latter proposals. The super-rich paid 90% under
Eisenhower and 72% under Nixon. Both were Republicans. They now pay 33%.
Most corporations and many elites utilize offshore tax havens and pay
nothing.
The argument for progressive taxation is that those who benefit more from
government should pay more. Cartel apologists propagate the fiction that the
poor soak up middle-class tax dollars, sowing division between the poor and
middle class.
Meanwhile, the Eight Families financial octopus feeds mightily
at the public trough be it,
-
the SEC (rich investors)
-
the FCC (Gulfstream jet
fliers)
-
the USDA (the richest farmers get the biggest checks)
-
Medicaid
(insurance fraud, Big Pharma gouging)
-
the Pentagon (Lockheed Martin,
Halliburton, Blackwater)
Still, $14 trillion is an insurmountable debt.
Increasing taxes on the
super-rich combined with a global American military withdrawal from its
current role as Hessianized mercenary force for the City of London banksters,
while welcome, will not be enough to deal with this monster debt, what
Jefferson termed, this "deliberate, systematic plan of reducing us to
slavery".
The belt-way dialogue on the deficit remains locked in a tiny intellectual
box created by the corporate media and their Federal Reserve cartel owners.
But there is another way.
It is a myth that most of that $14 trillion debt is owed to the Chinese or
other "governments". The vast majority - around $10 trillion - is owed to
the Eight Families Federal Reserve crowd.
In a June 9, 2011 article for Marketwatch, Unicredit's Chief US Economist
Harm Bandholz stated that the Federal Reserve is the largest holder of US
debt with around 14% of the total. This does not include debt held by
Rothschild-controlled central banks of other nations - including China,
Japan and the GCC oil fiefdoms.
Through the recent QE2 program, the Fed purchased another $600 billion in
Treasury bonds. They claimed it was a last ditch attempt to save the global
economy from deflation. Instead, the banksters who got the interest free
taxpayer-backed money pushed us further towards deflation by refusing to
lend their welfare bonanza to potential homeowners or small business.
Conversely and inherent in the printing of zero-interest money, they created
inflation - speculating in oil, food and gold futures and rolling this
increased US debt on the roulette tables at their various wholly-owned
global stock exchanges.
Is it any wonder the financial parasite class is now
clamoring for QE3?
What follows is a ten-step proposal which President Obama and the Congress
could enact to lift the $14 trillion debt from the backs of future
generations of Americans.
These should be done concurrently as part of a
single sweeping financial reform bill. Modeled after last week's release of
strategic petroleum reserves by twenty-seven nations, this measure should be
enacted in tandem with as many willing nations as possible. The same
Rothschild-led cabal controls the central banks of most every nation and
there is power in numbers.
If these measures are enacted separately or by
only one nation, the Eight Families cartel will use their financial clout to
target and destroy the US:
-
Introduce a Treasury
Department-administered infrastructure investment fund, which
workers should be strongly encouraged to opt into using accrued
funds from their private 401K plans.
This is important because the banker's
stock market casino will crash due to the next nine steps and
workers must be shielded from this event. This fund can be used to
rebuild America's infrastructure, with American workers acting as
lenders and receiving a fair rate of interest in return.
-
The US needs to withdraw from the
Bank
of International Settlements, the World Trade Organization, the
World Bank, the
IMF and all Eight Families-controlled multilateral
lending facilities. We would save billions funding these banker
welfare schemes while freeing ourselves from rules which prevent our
financial emancipation.
-
De-link the dollar from all currency
baskets and IMF special drawing rights. Ban trade in dollars on all
global exchanges. This will create a demand for dollars and
strengthen our badly devalued currency.
Impose currency controls by fixing the
dollar at,
During the 1997 Asian financial crisis,
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fixed the nation's
currency -
the ringit. It was the only currency in the region that
did not crash when Rothschild front-man
George Soros took aim at the
region.
-
Nationalize the Federal Reserve.
According to a London barrister I have been in contact with, under
the Federal Reserve Act there is a provision that allows for the US
government to buy back the Fed's charter for $4 billion. We should
pay this fee, revoke the Fed charter and launch a new US dollar
issued by the Treasury Department. With the dollar fixed, the
vampires cannot crash it.
-
Cancel the $10 trillion debt to the
Illuminati bankers. Debt obligations to foreign governments and
small bond-holders should be honored at par.
-
Arrest the perpetrators. Prosecute to
the fullest extent of the law all fraudulent transactions involving
the Fed cartel. Send the FBI to the New York Fed. Seize all
documents. Confiscate the world's largest gold reserves which are
stored there. These were stolen from various governments including
from our own Ft. Knox reserves.
-
Forget just repealing the Bush tax cuts
on the rich. The top tax rate on people who make more than $1
million/year should be raised to 75%. People making more than
$500,000/year should pay 50%. All tax brackets below $75,000/year
should see tax cuts. If you get more from government you need to pay
for it, instead of soaking the middle-class and blaming it on the
poor.
-
Slash Pentagon spending. Shut down all
US military bases on foreign soil, including those in Europe, Japan
and South Korea. Withdraw ALL troops from Iraq and Afghanistan
immediately. Use the savings to pay off government and small
bond-holders.
-
Outlaw offshore banking by US citizens
and corporations. Bring your money home and pay taxes on it or
surrender your US passport/corporate charter. The dramatic increase
in tax revenue would be enough to pay off the remaining debt to
sovereign governments and small bond-holders, while keeping our
obligations to the Social Security trust fund.
-
Introduce single-payer health care and
price controls on prescription drugs. The current corporate
for-profit health care bonanza depends upon sickness and ill health
for its hefty profits.
In 2006 Canada government spent $3,678
per person for free single-payer coverage for all its citizens. The
US government spent $6,714 per person covering the insurance,
pharmaceutical, hospital and AMA cartels.
The savings attained from eliminating
insurance/pharmaceutical/hospital chain/doctor-perpetrated
Medicare/Medicaid/Social Security fraud will save the US Treasury
billions. It is the only solution to skyrocketing and unsustainable
health care costs.
Using this methodology the US could wipe out
both its deficit and its debt within a year.
These measures should be planned in secret and
introduced swiftly and in rapid succession. Social security and Medicare
will be saved. The middle class will see their tax rates go down, while
their retirement fund finances the rebuilding of a 21st Century America.
Manufacturing jobs will come home, since the Chinese yuan will have seen a
dramatic appreciation. Our national security will be enhanced by withdrawing
from the role of global policeman.
If we keep thinking inside the banker-manufactured beltway box, our children
have no future. They will live in a Third World country which produces
nothing, lorded over by debt-collector parasites known as the "financial
services industry".
The wealth-destroying Eight Families banker elite are the perpetrators of
the US debt crime. Should a woman who is raped serve the sentence of her
rapist? That's absurd.
Then why should Americans or any other nation pay a
fraudulent debt foisted upon them by con-men?
It is time for
Obama and the Congress to get a
backbone and force
the criminal Federal Reserve cartel to make the
"broad
sacrifices".
