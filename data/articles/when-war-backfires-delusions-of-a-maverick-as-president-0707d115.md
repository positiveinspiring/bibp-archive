On the 14th July 1958, a popular revolution overthrew the British imposed
royal regime, which had opened the door wide for Western monopolies to
plunder the country's oil wealth, under unjust concessions.
In fact, it took until the 17th of July 1968 before the country's oil was
rescued from the control of international capital. It was subsequently
consolidated in the Oil Nationalization Bill in 1972.
Lesson to Bush, Blair and now Brown: Listen to history...!!!
Bush Directive for a "Catastrophic Emergency" in America:
Building a Justification for Waging
War on Iran?
How to reverse the tide?
The threat of a Second Al Qaeda "Attack on America" is being used profusely
by the Bush administration to galvanize public opinion in support of a
global military agenda.
Known and documented, the "Islamic terror network" is a creation of the US
intelligence apparatus. The "war on terrorism" is bogus. The 911 narrative
as conveyed by the 911 Commission report is fabricated.
The Bush administration is involved in acts of cover-up and complicity at
the highest levels of government.
Revealing the lies behind 911 would serve to undermine the legitimacy of the
"global war on terrorism" which constitutes the main justification for
waging war in the Middle East.
Without 911, the war criminals in high office do not have a leg to stand on.
Their entire National Security construct collapses like a deck of cards.
