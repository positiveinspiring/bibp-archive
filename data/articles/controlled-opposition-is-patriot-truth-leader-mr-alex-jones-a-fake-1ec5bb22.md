Alex Jones
Alexander Emerick Jones is an American
paleoconservative radio host and documentary filmmaker.
His nationally syndicated talk show (titled
The
Alex Jones Show) airs via the Genesis Communication Network on over 60 AM,
FM, and Short Wave radio stations across the United States, as well as
having a large internet based audience.
Alex Jones has been referred to as a conspiracy
theorist by mainstream media outlets, while Russia Today has referred to
him as an investigative journalist. Alex Jones was born February 11, 1974.
The elite put Alex Jones in place to be the leader and symbol of the
alternative media.
Alex Jones repeatedly attacks the idea that TV Fakery was used
on 9/11. It
has become obvious to serious investigators of 9-11 that no airplanes were
used in the attack.
Is Alex Jones naive to catch on, or is he deliberately
covering up evidence that links the mainstream media to 9-11?
Indeed, Alex Jones would appear to have a clear motive for wanting to cover
up the medias role in 9-11.
His network,
GCN Live, has
close ties to
ABC
News. In fact, ABC NY provides satellite broadcasting services for The Alex
Jones Show.
Some say that this is only a business deal, and is not very
important
but think about it:
Why would part of
the controlled media provide satellites
to a network that was dangerous to them?
This is easily explained by considering that
Alex Jones is not really on the side of real truth.
His job is to distract us from following the
most important people in the world
the Jesuits.
ABC is owned by
Walt Disney, which has had a Jesuit priest
on its board of directors since 1996. This brings us to the question of why
Jones is seemingly reluctant to talk about the role of the Society of Jesus
in world corruption.
When Alex Jones released his famous Dark Secrets
- Inside Bohemian Grove
film, he gave us detailed background information about the Grove, yet, for
some reason he left out the fact that Roman Catholic masses take place at
the Grove, and that the
Bohemian Grove Clubs patron saint is
John of Nepomuk, a
Roman Catholic figure who symbolizes the Seal of Confession.
The story of
John of Nepomuk was developed by Bohuslav Balb√≠n, a Jesuit.
Alex Alex Jones suspicious connections do not end there.
-
He has close ties
with the
John Birch Society
-
His father was a member of JBS and he had its
President, John F. McManus, on his show
-
McManus was trained by Jesuits at Holy
Cross College and was involved in US Air Force Weapons Development
