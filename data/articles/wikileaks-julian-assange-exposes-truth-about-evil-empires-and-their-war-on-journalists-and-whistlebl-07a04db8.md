Wikileaks' whistleblower Julian Assange rocked the world today,
delivering a speech from the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Assange had recently sought political asylum from the government of Ecuador,
and he was granted that asylum by Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa.
Shortly after being accepted into the embassy and treated with great
compassion by the Ecuadorian staff, Julian was threatened by the terrorist
government of the UK. That government showed its true warmongering nature by
threatening an armed raid on the embassy for the purpose of kidnapping
Julian Assange.
This threat is, of course, an act of war against
the sovereign nation of Ecuador.
The UK, like any evil empire, recognizes no
law except the law of force. Much like the USA, the UK will use the threat
of force, armed assaults, and even kidnappings in order to silence
whistleblowers that might embarrass the political elite.
In all this, Julian Assange has emerged as the moral hero, besieged by
powerful, corrupt empires intent on crushing the truth and suppressing
journalistic freedoms. The longer Assange stays alive and continues to
speak, the more evil and morally bankrupt the USA and UK appear.
Even in the face of great evil, Assange found the strength to lay out this
fundamental truth:
"The United States must pledge before the
world that it will not pursue journalists for shining the light on the
secret crimes of the powerful," he said today.
"There must be no more foolish talk about prosecuting any media
organization, be it Wikileaks or be in the New York Times."
Watch Assange's speech:
In pursuing Assange, the USA
has shown itself to be
...a true evil empire - Darth Vader would be proud
In the original Star Wars, Lord Tarkin, speaking to Vader, famously said,
"This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader
will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this
station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift
stroke."
Tarkin also spoke of dismantling the Senate and
dissolving the "Old Republic."
Tarkin: [walking in with Darth Vader] "The
Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just
received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away."
The US government is now walking in the very
footsteps of Tarkin, Vader and the "evil empire" famously depicted in Star
Wars.
Any thought of protecting free speech, the First
Amendment, the Second Amendment, or any part of the Bill of Rights is
ancient history. The corrupt, criminal elements that currently run the
country have decided to crush anyone who dares to tell the truth. All
whistleblowers will be targeted for destruction.
Whistleblower websites are
also being attacked by CIA front groups.
But Assange fires back from the moral high ground, saying,
"The US administration's war on
whistleblowers must end... Bradley Manning must be released."
Why Ecuador is willing to
stand against the tyranny of the UK/USA
When it comes to Ecuador, very few U.S. journalists have as much first-hand
experience with the country as I do.
I used to live in Ecuador. I have an Ecuadorian
driver's license and a resident visa. I once owned property there and speak
a fair amount of Spanish, having interacted daily with the Ecuadorian
people, the local bureaucrats, the local police chief and more.
Ecuador is a nation besieged by the imperialist USA and its evil intent. As
we have fully documented, the U.S. breached Ecuadorian sovereignty and
dispatched a secret team there
to kidnap Greg Caton
for the "crime" of selling anti-cancer herbs via mail order.
The U.S. also ran "drug war" chemical weapons bombing runs on Ecuadorian
farms, poisoning the local villages that were growing coca plants to make
coca tea. This is one of the key reasons why Ecuadorian President Correa
shut down the Manta military base and kicked the USA out of the country.
Ecuador currently uses the U.S. dollar as its currency. Through its
inflationary monetary policy, the USA is effectively stealing money from
Ecuador, driving up prices of everyday goods while economically
destabilizing the country.
This has created a situation of political
tension, where an attempted coup against Correa took place roughly a year
ago.
He was able to survive that attempt and
re-establish power, but the continued price inflation of basic goods in
Ecuador - food, propane, fuel, etc. - is pressuring the country political
class to take action.
Latin America hates
the USA
Latin America hates the USA. Make no mistake about that.
Just live there for
a month or two, talk to the locals, and you'll hear no end to it.
In fact - and here's the big secret nobody is reporting - Latin America has
already had secret talks about forming their own reserve currency, and plans
are under way to dump the U.S. dollar ahead of the coming global financial
collapse.
Correa is a key person in this discussion, and
I've already been informed that the printing plates of the replacement
currency have been completed and are ready to roll. It's only a matter of
time before Latin America dumps the dollar and forms its own economic block.
In response to this, you can expect the U.S. to continue pursuing its acts
of economic warfare against Latin American countries.
If you aren't aware of any of this (because
you've never been taught real history), watch these shocking, eye-opening
video interviews with John Perkins, author of "Confessions of an
Economic Hit Man."
For the record, we support free journalism, free speech and
whistleblowers around the globe.
Julian Assange is a hero, and it's time we
stopped imprisoning the whistleblowers and started imprisoning the real
criminals who run the corrupt governments.
