The Israeli government uses such
denial of water
to trigger people displacement,
particularly in areas slated for
colonial expansion,
especially since these communities
are mostly farmers,
who depend on water for their
livelihoods.
Cutting off Palestinian communities
from their water resources
usually precedes dispossession of
land for new colonial projects.
Water is a
necessity to all forms of life.
Access to clean
water is an essential precondition for the viability of any community.
Sanitation,
especially wastewater treatment, is also essential for public health, for
protection of the environment, and for water reservation. International laws
and universally accepted sanitation standards have been set up to protect
the right to access clean water and to protect environment and water
conservation.
In occupied
Palestine the Israeli government is violating all these rights, and had
turned water into weapon of slow graduated genocide.
Many Palestinian
cities in the West Bank and especially in the Gaza Strip face chronic clean
water shortages. The rural communities are virtually deprived of water and
depend mainly on very expensive tank-water supplies. In the main cities
Palestinians have access to an average of only 70 liters of water per person
per day for domestic use and personal hygiene, much less than the World
Health Organization (WHO) recommended minimum of 100 liters.
In the rural areas
Palestinians are surviving on 20-30 liters of water per person per day,
while adjacent illegal Israeli colonies (settlements) built on stolen
Palestinian land enjoy unlimited constant supply of water for personal as
well as recreational (swimming pools, parks and gardens) use.
It was estimated
that 44% of Palestinian children in the rural areas suffer from diarrhea -
the biggest killer of children under 5 years old in the world- because of
poor water quality and hygiene standards.
According to the
UNHRC Israeli,
"Settlements benefit from enough water to run farms and
orchards, and for swimming pools and spas, while Palestinians often
struggle to access the minimum water requirements.
Some settlements consume around 400 l/c/d, whereas
Palestinian consumption is 73 l/c/d, and as little as 10-20 l/c/c for
Bedouin communities which depend on expensive and low quality tanker
water."
Aware of the dire
water situation in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, donor countries
had supported Palestinian Authority's efforts to develop the water and
sanitation sector, and had specified funds for the construction of water
reservoirs, wastewater treatment facilities, and the repair and expansion of
water and sewage networks.
Emergency Water
Sanitation and Hygiene Group
(EWASH), a coalition of 30 leading
humanitarian agencies, have been working with Palestinian local authorities
to identify and to respond to water, sanitation and hygienic needs to
Palestinian communities.
Under international
humanitarian laws water resources and projects, including water sanitation
and hygiene (WASH) infrastructures are considered civilian facilities
essential for the survival of the population, and thus are protected from
destruction under any circumstance.
Yet the Israeli
government, with its long record of violating many international laws, with
the cooperation of its national water company Mekorot and the Israeli agri-industrial
firm Mehadrin had adopted systematic, grave, malicious and discriminatory
policies to hinder Palestinian access to water in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, combined with massive theft of water resources.
A
report
by
the United Nations Human Rights Council states that the
two Israeli Mekorot and Mehadrin companies severely undermine Palestinians'
access to water, especially in occupied Jordan Valley, siphoning Palestinian
wells and springs water to the illegal Israeli colonies (settlements) in the
West Bank.
Palestinian
water is stolen and piped into Israel at no cost. A fraction of it is then
piped back and sold to Palestinian cities. In this way Israel is stealing
from Palestinians both their water and their money.
In Oslo II
agreement a Palestinian Israeli Joint Water Committee (JWC) was established
to manage water resources and wastewater treatment facilities.
The Israeli
government exercises a veto-like power within JWC and through slow
bureaucracy blocks most licenses and permits for new water facilities in the
West Bank, conditioning them on Palestinian reciprocal approval of projects
in the illegal colonies (settlements); an arrangement the Palestinian
Authority rejects for fear of legitimizing these colonies.
The ability of the
Palestinian Authority to develop its
WASH sector to meet its national
priorities has been severely limited by Israeli policies.
Palestinians have
not been able to build the needed large scale water service infrastructures
to secure water and sanitation services to its population. Between 1995 and
2011 the Palestinian Authority submitted 30 projects for wastewater
treatment plant projects to the JWC for approval.
Only four of these,
related to minor repair, were accepted. Again in 2011 the Palestinian
Authority submitted 38 projects to rehabilitate agricultural water wells but
the JWC approved only three of them.
Due to the Israeli
imposed artificial water shortages and lack of wastewater treatment
facilities and sewage networks the majority of Palestinians resorted to the
old practice of constructing privately owned water wells, cesspits and
septic tanks. In the rural areas Palestinians depend on rain water gathering
pools, cisterns and water tanks.
This increases the
risks of public health and damage to the environment.
Besides the Israeli
protracted bureaucracy and the open theft of Palestinian water, the Israeli
government had adopted and implemented unethical and illegal policies and
practices to destroy Palestinian water resources and to contaminate their
farmland to actuate Palestinian self- evacuation of a coveted area and the
spread of deadly disease among their vulnerable children.
The terrorist
Israeli army routinely carries what is called demolition orders of alleged
unlicensed communal water cisterns and water wells in privately owned
farmland.
Many of these
cisterns and wells are hundreds of years old; older than the illegal state
of Israel itself.
The demolition orders also include WASH structures and
water tanks supplied to Palestinian rural areas, and animal and tractor
driven water tanks. In 2011 alone Israeli army had demolished 89 WASH
structures in the West Bank including 21 wells, 34 cisterns and many small
fixed water tanks given to the rural households especially those in the
Jordan Valley.
Such demolition
also included the razing of vegetable gardens and the destruction of animal
barns and storage sheds.
This destruction
violates Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the
destruction of private or public property, and it is a clear violation of
the right to water, a component of the right to an adequate standard of
living, protected by Article 11 of the International covenant of Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights.
The Israeli
government uses such denial of water to trigger people displacement,
particularly in areas slated for colonial expansion, especially since these
communities are mostly farmers, who depend on water for their livelihoods.
Cutting off Palestinian communities from their water resources usually
precedes dispossession of land for new colonial projects.
The 700 kilometer
Israeli-built separation/apartheid wall, been under construction since 2002,
has been deliberately snaked through the West Bank to include, on the
Israeli side, the rich fertile Palestinian agricultural land with large
groundwater aquifers, especially within Jenin, Qalqilya, and Tulkarem
provinces.
The wall has
further reduced Palestinian access to water and has resulted into the loss
of access to 49 water wells and reservoirs used for drinking and
agricultural purposes.
In the besieged
Gaza Strip water resources and water treatment facilities seem to be one of
the main targets of the Israeli air raids and land incursions. Sewage
pumping stations, wastewater treatment facilities, main city water
reservoirs and agricultural cisterns, many of them predate the illegal
establishment of Israeli state, sustained direct bombing by Israeli war
planes.
Since 2005 Israeli
military incursions had intentionally destroyed at least 300 agricultural
wells located in the Israeli designated buffer zone.
Scores of wells,
rainwater harvesting cisterns, roof water tanks, and many miles of water
main pipes and other farm irrigation networks have been deliberately
targeted and destroyed by Israeli forces during their military operations.
During the 2008/09
Israeli "Cast Lead" offensive against Gaza, the Israeli air raids,
artilleries and military tanks targeted Gaza's vital water resources;
pumping stations, wastewater treatment facilities and sewage treatment
plants causing damages worth $6 million.
The situation
in Gaza is
especially dire.
Palestinians
rely entirely on the already depleted, saltwater-contaminated and
sewage-polluted aquifer, whose water is unfit for human consumption. The
illegal inhumane Israeli imposed siege restricts the import of many
essential goods including the fuel necessary to run Gaza's single power
station.
Without
electricity wastewater treatment facilities and running water pumps cannot
operate, resulting sewage pollution. It is estimated that 89 million liters
of sewage flow daily into the Mediterranean Sea raising the level of
nitrates in water, up to six times above the WHO limits of 50 mg/l.
This also
contaminates the fish many Palestinians in Gaza depend on as the main food
items.
Up to 95% of the
water extracted from the Gaza coastal aquifer is unsuitable for human
consumption due to over exploitation and wastewater contamination. Many
families depend on tinkered water. Sadly this water, too, has been found to
be severely contaminated by bacteria.
According to
UNRWA
diarrhea and viral hepatitis are the major causes of morbidity in the
refugee population of the Gaza Strip.
The worst damage to
Palestinian water resources, to their farmland, and to the environment is
caused by the armed to the teeth religiously extremists occupiers
(settlers).
Driven by their
supremacist racist religion, and unhindered, but tacitly encouraged and
protected, by the Israeli government and army, these Israeli fanatics
illegally and forcefully occupy hill tops of Palestinian farm land, build
their illegal colonies, and start attacking the neighboring Palestinian
communities.
Besides attacking
Palestinian homes, torching their crops and animal barns, they confiscate
water springs, poison Palestinian water wells with chemicals, spoil them
with dirty diapers, with their own feces or with dead chickens, and topple
and shoot roof top water tanks.
Those fanatic
colonizers are the largest per capita producers of wastewater in the West
Bank, discharging large quantities of sewage directly into the environment,
contaminating adjacent agricultural land and water streams.
Randomly building
their colonies on the hill tops without sewage and wastewater treatment
facilities those extremist colonizers dump their wastewater and sewage down
the hill towards Palestinian communities and farmland causing severe
ecological damage and contamination to Palestinian agricultural food
products thus spreading diseases.
As reported
by the UN in March
2012, one other major threat to Palestinians arises from settlers seizing
springs by force. The report states:
"Palestinians
have increasingly lost access to water sources in the West Bank as a
result of the takeover of springs by Israeli settlers, who have used
threats, intimidation and fences to ensure control of water points close
to the settlements."
The UN
Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) examined 50 springs on
Palestinian land close to Israeli settlements and found that:
"In 22 of the
water sources, Palestinians have been deterred from accessing the
springs by acts of intimidation, threats and violence perpetrated by
Israeli settlers, while in the eight springs under full settler control,
Palestinian access has been prevented by physical obstacles, including
the fencing of the spring area, and its de facto annexation' to the
settlement."
Israel is
deliberately and arrogantly violating many international laws it is a state
party of, notably,
-
the
International Covenant on Economic
-
Social and
Cultural Rights (ICESCR)
-
the
International Covenant on Civil And Political Rights (ICCPR)
-
the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination
-
the UN
Convention on the Rights of Child (CRC)
-
the UN
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women (CEDAW)
-
the Fourth
Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocol I protecting victims
of armed conflicts and many of the Hague Regulations
Israel's violation
of all these international laws accompanied with its unethical policies and
practices to deprive the whole Palestinian population of their access rights
to the necessary clean water is considered a genocidal crime, a crime Israel
(Jews) is very famous of.
