The Rise Of Internet Feudalism.
Distributed citizen groups
and nimble hackers once had the edge.
Now governments and corporations are catching
up.
Who will dominate in the decades ahead?
Were in the middle of an epic battle for power
in cyberspace.
On one side are the traditional, organized, institutional
powers such as governments and large multinational corporations. On the
other are the distributed and nimble: grassroots movements, dissident
groups, hackers, and criminals.
Initially, the Internet empowered the second
side. It gave them a place to coordinate and communicate efficiently, and
made them seem unbeatable. But now, the more traditional institutional
powers are winning, and winning big. How these two side fare in the long
term, and the fate of the rest of us who dont fall into either group, is an
open question - and one vitally important to the future of the Internet.
In the Internets early days, there was a lot of
talk about its "natural laws" - how it would upend traditional power blocks,
empower the masses, and spread freedom throughout the world.
The
international nature of the Internet circumvented national laws. Anonymity
was easy. Censorship was impossible. Police were clueless about cybercrime.
And bigger changes seemed inevitable. Digital cash would undermine national
sovereignty. Citizen journalism would topple traditional media, corporate
PR, and political parties.
Easy digital copying would destroy the
traditional movie and music industries. Web marketing would allow even the
smallest companies to compete against corporate giants. It really would be a
new world order.
This was a utopian vision, but some of it did
come to pass. Internet marketing has transformed commerce.
The entertainment
industries have been transformed by things like MySpace and YouTube, and are
now more open to outsiders. Mass media has changed dramatically, and some of
the most influential people in the media have come from the blogging world.
There are new ways to organize politically and run elections.
Crowd-funding
has made tens of thousands of projects possible to finance, and
crowd-sourcing made more types of projects possible. Facebook and Twitter
really did help topple governments.
But that is just one side of the Internets
disruptive character. The Internet has emboldened traditional power as well.
On the corporate side, power is consolidating, a
result of two current trends in computing.
First, the rise of cloud
computing means that we no longer have control of our data. Our e-mail,
photos, calendars, address books, messages, and documents are on servers
belonging to,
...and so on.
And second, we
are increasingly accessing our data using devices that we have much less
control over:
-
iPhones
-
iPads
-
Android phones
-
Kindle
-
ChromeBooks,
...and so
on.
Unlike traditional operating systems, those devices are controlled much
more tightly by the vendors, who limit what software can run, what they can
do, how theyre updated, and so on. Even Windows 8 and Apples Mountain Lion
operating system are heading in the direction of more vendor control.
I have previously characterized this model of
computing as "feudal."
Users pledge their allegiance to more powerful companies who, in turn,
promise to protect them from both sysadmin duties and security threats. Its
a metaphor thats rich in history and in fiction, and a model thats
increasingly permeating computing today.
Medieval feudalism was a hierarchical political
system, with obligations in both directions. Lords offered protection, and
vassals offered service. The lord-peasant relationship was similar, with a
much greater power differential. It was a response to a dangerous world.
Feudal security consolidates power in the hands
of the few. Internet companies, like lords before them, act in their own
self-interest. They use their relationship with us to increase their
profits, sometimes at our expense. They act arbitrarily. They make mistakes.
Theyre deliberately - and incidentally - changing social norms.
Medieval
feudalism gave the lords vast powers over the landless peasants; were
seeing the same thing on the Internet.
Its not all bad, of course. We, especially
those of us who are not technical, like the convenience, redundancy,
portability, automation, and shareability of vendor-managed devices. We like
cloud backup. We like automatic updates. We like not having to deal with
security ourselves. We like that Facebook just works - from any device,
anywhere.
Government power is
also increasing
on the Internet. There is more government surveillance than ever before.
There is more government censorship than ever before. There is more
government propaganda, and an increasing number of governments are
controlling what their users can and cannot do on the Internet. Totalitarian
governments are embracing a growing "cyber sovereignty" movement to further
consolidate their power.
And the cyberwar arms race is
on, pumping an enormous amount of money into cyber-weapons and consolidated
cyber-defenses, further increasing government power.
In many cases, the interests of corporate and
government powers are aligning.
Both corporations and governments benefit
from ubiquitous surveillance, and the NSA is using Google, Facebook,
Verizon, and others to get access to data it couldnt otherwise. The
entertainment industry is looking to governments to enforce its antiquated
business models.
Commercial security equipment from companies like
BlueCoat
and Sophos is being used by oppressive governments to surveil and censor
their citizens.
The same facial recognition technology that Disney uses in
its theme parks can also identify protesters in China and Occupy Wall Street
activists in New York. Think of it as a public/private surveillance
partnership.
What happened? How, in those early Internet
years, did we get the future so wrong?
The truth is that technology magnifies power in
general, but rates of adoption are different. The unorganized, the
distributed, the marginal, the dissidents, the powerless, the criminal:
They
can make use of new technologies very quickly. And when those groups
discovered the Internet, suddenly they had power.
But later, when the
already-powerful big institutions finally figured out how to harness the
Internet, they had more power to magnify. T
hats the difference: The
distributed were more nimble and were faster to make use of their new power,
while the institutional were slower but were able to use their power more
effectively.
So while the Syrian dissidents used Facebook to
organize, the Syrian government used Facebook to identify dissidents to
arrest.
All isnt lost for distributed power, though.
For institutional power, the Internet is a change in degree, but for
distributed power its a qualitative one. The Internet gives decentralized
groups - for the first time - the ability to coordinate.
This can have
incredible ramifications, as we saw in the SOPA/PIPA debate, Gezi, Brazil,
and the rising use of crowd-funding.
It can invert power dynamics, even in
the presence of surveillance censorship and use control. But aside from
political coordination, the Internet allows for social coordination as well
to unite, for example, ethnic diasporas, gender minorities, sufferers of
rare diseases, and people with obscure interests.
This isnt static: Technological advances
continue to provide advantage to the nimble. I discussed this trend in my
book Liars and Outliers. If you think of security as an arms race
between attackers and defenders, any technological advance gives one side or
the other a temporary advantage.
But most of the time, a new technology
benefits the nimble first. They are not hindered by bureaucracy - and
sometimes not by laws or ethics either. They can evolve faster.
We saw it with the Internet.
As soon as the
Internet started being used for commerce, a new breed of cybercriminal
emerged, immediately able to take advantage of the new technology. It took
police a decade to catch up.
And we saw it on social media, as political
dissidents made use of its organizational powers before totalitarian regimes
did.
This delay is what I call a "security gap." Its
greater when theres more technology, and in times of rapid technological
change.
Basically, if there are more innovations to exploit, there will be
more damage resulting from society's inability to keep up with exploiters of
all of them. And since our world is one in which theres more technology
than ever before, and a faster rate of technological change than ever
before, we should expect to see a greater security gap than ever before.
In
other words, there will be an increasing time period during which nimble
distributed powers can make use of new technologies before slow
institutional powers can make better use of those technologies.
This is the battle: quick vs. strong. To return
to medieval metaphors, you can think of a nimble distributed power - whether
marginal, dissident, or criminal - as Robin Hood; and ponderous
institutional powers - both government and corporate - as the feudal lords.
So who wins? Which type of power dominates in
the coming decades?
Right now, it looks like traditional power.
Ubiquitous
surveillance means that its easier for the government to identify
dissidents than it is for the dissidents to remain anonymous.
Data
monitoring means easier for the Great Firewall of China to block data than
it is for people to circumvent it. The way we all use the Internet makes it
much easier for the NSA to spy on everyone than it is for anyone to maintain
privacy. And even though it is easy to circumvent digital copy protection,
most users still cant do it.
The problem is that leveraging Internet power
requires technical expertise.
Those with sufficient ability will be able to
stay ahead of institutional powers. Whether its setting up your own e-mail
server, effectively using encryption and anonymity tools, or breaking copy
protection, there will always be technologies that can evade institutional
powers.
This is why cybercrime is still pervasive, even as police savvy
increases; why technically capable whistleblowers can do so much damage; and
why organizations like Anonymous are still a viable social and political
force. Assuming technology continues to advance - and theres no reason to
believe it wont - there will always be a security gap in which technically
advanced Robin Hoods can operate.
Most people, though, are stuck in the middle.
These are people who have dont have the technical ability to evade either
the large governments and corporations, avoid the criminal and hacker groups
who prey on us, or join any resistance or dissident movements. These are the
people who accept default configuration options, arbitrary terms of service, NSA-installed back doors, and the occasional complete loss of their data.
These are the people who get increasingly isolated as government and
corporate power align.
In the feudal world, these are the hapless peasants.
And its even worse when the feudal lords - or any powers - fight each
other.
As anyone watching Game of Thrones knows, peasants get
trampled when powers fight: when Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon fight
it out in the market; when the U.S., EU, China, and Russia fight it out in
geopolitics; or when its the U.S. vs. "the terrorists" or China vs. its
dissidents.
The abuse will only
get worse as
technology continues to advance. In the battle between institutional power
and distributed power, more technology means more damage.
Weve already seen
this:
Cybercriminals can rob more people more quickly than criminals who
have to physically visit everyone they rob. Digital pirates can make more
copies of more things much more quickly than their analog forebears.
And
well see it in the future:
3D printers mean that the computer restriction
debate will soon involves guns, not movies.
Big data will mean that more
companies will be able to identify and track you more easily. Its the same
problem as the "weapons of mass destruction" fear: terrorists with nuclear
or biological weapons can do a lot more damage than terrorists with
conventional explosives.
And by the same token, terrorists with large-scale cyberweapons can potentially do more damage than terrorists with those same
bombs.
Its a numbers game.
Very broadly, because of
the way humans behave as a species and as a society, every society is going
to have a certain amount of crime. And theres a particular crime rate
society is willing to tolerate.
With historically inefficient criminals, we
were willing to live with some percentage of criminals in our society. As
technology makes each individual criminal more powerful, the percentage we
can tolerate decreases.
Again, remember the "weapons of mass destruction"
debate: As the amount of damage each individual terrorist can do increases,
we need to do increasingly more to prevent even a single terrorist from
succeeding.
The more destabilizing the technologies, the
greater the rhetoric of fear, and the stronger institutional powers will
get. This means increasingly repressive security measures, even if the
security gap means that such measures become increasingly ineffective. And
it will squeeze the peasants in the middle even more.
Without the protection of his own feudal lord,
the peasant was subject to abuse both by criminals and other feudal lords.
But both corporations and the government - and often the two in cahoots -
are using their power to their own advantage, trampling on our rights in the
process. And without the technical savvy to become Robin Hoods ourselves, we
have no recourse but to submit to whatever the ruling institutional power
wants.
So what happens as technology increases? Is a
police state the only effective way to control distributed power and keep
our society safe? Or do the fringe elements inevitably destroy society as
technology increases their power? Probably neither doomsday scenario will
come to pass, but figuring out a stable middle ground is hard.
These
questions are complicated, and dependent on future technological advances
that we cannot predict. But they are primarily political questions, and any
solutions will be political.
In the short term, we need more
transparency and oversight.
The more we know of what institutional powers are doing, the more we can
trust that they are not abusing their authority. We have long known this to
be true in government, but we have increasingly ignored it in our fear of
terrorism and other modern threats.
This is also true for corporate power.
Unfortunately, market dynamics will not necessarily force corporations to be
transparent; we need laws to do that. The same is true for decentralized
power; transparency is how well differentiate political dissidents from
criminal organizations.
Oversight is also critically important, and is
another long-understood mechanism for checking power. This can be a
combination of things: courts that act as third-party advocates for the rule
of law rather than rubber-stamp organizations, legislatures that understand
the technologies and how they affect power balances, and vibrant
public-sector press and watchdog groups that analyze and debate the actions
of those wielding power.
Transparency and oversight give us the
confidence to trust institutional powers to fight the bad side of
distributed power, while still allowing the good side to flourish. For if
were going to entrust our security to institutional powers, we need to know
they will act in our interests and not abuse that power. Otherwise,
democracy fails.
In the longer term, we need to work to reduce
power differences.
The key to all of this is access to data. On the
Internet, data is power. To the extent the powerless have access to it, they
gain in power. To the extent that the already powerful have access to it,
they further consolidate their power. As we look to reducing power
imbalances, we have to look at data: data privacy for individuals, mandatory
disclosure laws for corporations, and open government laws.
Medieval feudalism evolved into a more balanced
relationship in which lords had responsibilities as well as rights. Todays
Internet feudalism is both ad-hoc and one-sided.
Those in power have a lot
of rights, but increasingly few responsibilities or limits. We need to
rebalance this relationship. In medieval Europe, the rise of the centralized
state and the rule of law provided the stability that feudalism lacked.
The
Magna Carta first forced responsibilities on governments and put humans on
the long road toward government by the people and for the people. In
addition to re-reigning in government power, we need similar restrictions on
corporate power: a new Magna Carta focused on the institutions that abuse
power in the 21st century.
Todays Internet is a fortuitous accident: a
combination of an initial lack of commercial interests, government benign
neglect, military requirements for survivability and resilience, and
computer engineers building open systems that worked simply and easily.
Corporations have turned the Internet into an enormous revenue generator,
and theyre not going to back down easily. Neither will governments, which
have harnessed the Internet for political control.
Were at the beginning of some critical debates
about the future of the Internet: the proper role of law enforcement, the
character of ubiquitous surveillance, the collection and retention of our
entire lifes history, how automatic algorithms should judge us, government
control over the Internet, cyberwar rules of engagement, national
sovereignty on the Internet, limitations on the power of corporations over
our data, the ramifications of information consumerism, and so on.
Data is the pollution problem of the information
age.
All computer processes produce it. It stays around. How we deal with it
- how we reuse and recycle it, who has access to it, how we dispose of it,
and what laws regulate it - is central to how the information age functions.
And I believe that just as we look back at the early decades of the
industrial age and wonder how society could ignore pollution in their rush
to build an industrial world, our grandchildren will look back at us during
these early decades of the information age and judge us on how we dealt with
the rebalancing of power resulting from all this new data.
This wont be an easy period for us as we try to
work these issues out. Historically, no shift in power has ever been easy.
Corporations have turned our personal data into an enormous revenue
generator, and theyre not going to back down. Neither will governments, who
have harnessed that same data for their own purposes. But we have a duty to
tackle this problem.
I cant tell you what the result will be. These
are all complicated issues, and require meaningful debate, international
cooperation, and innovative solutions.
We need to decide on the proper
balance between institutional and decentralized power, and how to build
tools that amplify what is good in each while suppressing the bad.
