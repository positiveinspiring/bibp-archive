It has been said that birds of a feather flock together, and proof of that statement can be seen in the fact that terrorist sympathizer John McCain was recently forced to act as Knight in Shining Armor for famed mass murderer Henry Kissinger as the latter was attempting to give yet another speech to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Kissinger's arrival, as well as the beginning of his speech, was interrupted by protesters from Code Pink, who attempted to list off the crimes of Henry Kissinger but were unable to continue their presentation for the requisite number of days it would take to do so due to the fact that Capitol Hill police were called in to remove them. McCain, always a friend to those who have committed or are doing their best to commit atrocities on a mass scale, erupted in typical angry fashion screaming at protesters,
"You know, you're going to have to shut up, or I'm going to have you arrested."
As the protesters were being removed, McCain also screamed,
"Get out of here you low-life scum."
McCain went on to apologize to Kissinger by stating that,
"Dr. Kissinger, I hope on behalf of all of the members of this committee on both sides of the aisle - in fact, from all of my colleagues, I'd like to apologize for allowing such disgraceful behavior towards a man who served his country with the greatest distinction. I apologize profusely."
Many Americans, particularly Vietnam veterans, however, may indeed remember,
"such disgraceful behavior towards a man who served his country with the greatest distinction" taking place in the Capitol on a number of occasions.
Indeed, the performance of John McCain standing in front of Congress and arguing against any further investigation or revelation of whether or not American POWs were still being held in Vietnam, would certainly count as one such instance. One other such instance might be his incessant grandstanding in support of al-Qaeda and ISIS, known to the mainstream media as "moderate rebels," freedom fighters, and the like. Yet, while McCain's support of the,
Vietnam war Iraq War Syrian War Libyan war,
Vietnam war
Iraq War
Syrian War
Libyan war,
...and virtually every war that was ever waged and those that ever will be waged upon the face of the earth, has resulted in the death of millions of people, McCain found himself in the presence of one of the true kings of killing in Henry Kissinger.
Indeed, Kissinger is one of the true living figures whose feet most psychopathic killers the world over still long to kneel at. Kissinger's direction of the Chilean coup, Vietnam war, Cambodian and Laotian tragedies, and his famous 'National Security Study Memorandum 200: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests' (NSSM200) has earned him a special place amongst the world's most effective mass murders, although admittedly not the most widely known. It is thus not surprising that McCain would come to the aid of Kissinger so readily.
In fact, it is not surprising that, after all these years and all these crimes against humanity, that Kissinger would be addressing such an important Congressional committee. Nor is it surprising that this committee boasts yet another criminal, terrorist supporter, insidious color revolution operative, and traitor like John McCain. The only surprising aspect of the whole affair was that the protesters were allowed to stay for as long as they did. Or was the most surprising aspect that there were protesters to begin with?
