1) President Obama has
signed more Executive Orders
bypassing the U.S. Constitution, Congress and We the People as
the Great Dictator, than any other President in history, while
simultaneously declaring he has no authority to regulate and
control To Big to Jail the people, with names, address' and
phone numbers that committed these crimes against the citizens
of the United States.
2) Whatever your opinion on
immigration may be, he alone just has decided that they he will
allow
some 5 million undocumented to
get drivers licenses
for five years, yet not legal status.
3) Yet he has been
the greatest deporter of
undocumented people in Presidential history.
4) Yet he has allowed
thousands and
thousands of children to
immigrate into the U.S., allegedly against the suddenly porous
southern borders, then lost track of them.
5) He has
sanctioned wars and committed
U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, Syria, Somalia,
Pakistan, etc., yet declared he was going to get us "out of the
war business" while campaigning for the Presidency.
6) He sits in his office on
"Drone Kill Tuesdays" and universally decides that he alone can
assassinate anyone he deems necessary
against the war on terror, including Americans by drone strikes,
many times killing innocent people and further creating enemies
against the U.S.
7) He has fired more high
level admirals and generals than any other President
who opposes his unilateral powers.
8) He condones torture, as he
alone has had the executive power to close the hideous torture
practices going on at Guantanamo Bay
and secret renditions torture centers set up in other countries
to avoid prosecution at home.
9) He did not protest when
citizen rights were demolished when allegedly two kids actions
caused Boston to go into a total lock down and we all learned
our new police state orders to "shelter in place" while much of
Boston was
occupied by the militarized police.
10) He did not protest when
Ferguson, MO
declared martial law last week
ahead of a grand jury decision.
11) He is
secretly fast tracking the TPP,
bypassing Congress entirely, to put the United States under
International Corporate rule.
12) He has
prosecuted more whistle blowers
than any other President in history.
13) He has
allowed more surveillance on
innocent U.S. citizens by tapping and recording our emails, our
phones and tracking our movements by our not so Secret Police.
14) He has run up more debt, $17
trillion dollars so far, on the We The People's debt ledger,
while Wall Street hits new highs, and jobs are new lows while
more people have lost their homes than while under any other
President.
U.S. NATIONAL
DEBT
CLOCK
The Outstanding Public Debt as of 22 Nov 2014 at
05:38:40 PM GMT is:
The estimated population of the United States is
319,461,665
so each citizen's share of this debt is $56,253.43.
The National Debt has continued to increase an
average of
$2.43 billion per day since September 30, 2012!
15) He has
taken-in more money from banksters
than any other President.
16) He has
outsourced more jobs out of the
U.S. than any other President.
17) He has allowed hundreds of
billions of dollars in fines for corporate malfeasance, yet
not one CEO has ever gone to jail
for killing and injuring We the People.
18) He declared in 2009, that
nearly one hundred thousand U.S. citizens would die of
the "pandemic" H1N1, when in
fact more people died of the common cold that year, but
allowed Big Pharma to make mandatory
vaccinations in many schools as well as Big Box
stores to virtually give out free vaccinations to all.
19) He made
mandatory healthcare to be paid
for all even or face mass tax penalties and fines even though
U.S. medicine ranks 43 in the world in quality and # 1 in cost
of care.
20) He is funding billions to move
children out of the homes into schools starting at age zero
because the State needs to control our children from "cradle to
grave" while promoting schools be open 24/7/365 because "parents
will have to be working so much":
21) He, and Congress, are to
allowing our country to be used as a supply house and a sewer
for frackers and Big Oil while
backing the XL pipeline to run
straight through they country to sell to foreign interests.
22) His former Chief of Staff,
Rahm Emanuel, served as a volunteer in the Israeli Army as well
as many other cabinet members
having duel Israeli/U.S. citizenships.
23) These are the actions
of our Dictator in our Fascist Totalitarian Regime, yet our
only forms of protest to express our grievances against our
Dictator is to stand in "Free
Speech" caged zones miles away from where any
politician speaks.
24) There will be another
false flag very soon, much greater than 9/11 according to
Darth Cheney:
Former vice president
Dick Cheney
'predicted' Tuesday (June 24,
2014) that
the U.S. will face a
catastrophic attack before the end of the decade
that will be worse than
the Sept. 11, 2001 bombings.
"I think there will be another
attack," Cheney
said on Hugh Hewitt's radio show.
"And next time, I think its
likely to be far deadlier than the last one.
You can just imagine what would
happen if somebody could smuggle a nuclear device,
put it in a shipping container,
and drive it down the Beltway outside of Washington, D.C."
Cheney, a hawkish Republican,
has been an outspoken critic of
President Obama's national security and foreign policy.
He
recently started a new group
with his daughter Liz Cheney
that aims to 'educate' the
public about their positions.

25) It is a near certainty now
that Obama will be
enforcing martial law in this country
before 2016 and not abdicate the throne.
