"Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years
since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance
with Eurasia.
But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge, which he
happened to possess because his memory was not
satisfactorily under control.
Officially the change of partners had never happened.
Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had
always been at war with Eurasia.
The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil,
and it followed that any past or future agreement with him
was impossible
"
George Orwell -
1984
Nations, cultures and populations are best
controlled through the use of false paradigms. This is a historically proven
tactic exploited for centuries by oligarchs around the world.
Under the Hegelian dialectic (the very
foundation of the Marxist and collectivist ideology), one could summarize
the trap of false paradigms as follows:
If (A) my
idea of freedom conflicts with (B) your idea of freedom, then (C)
neither of us can be free until everyone agrees to be a slave.
In other words:
problem, reaction, solution.
Two
sides are pitted against each other in an engineered contest.
Each side is
led to believe that its position is the good and right position. Neither
side questions the legitimacy of the conflict, because each side fears this
will lead to ideological weakness and disunity.
The two sides go to war, sometimes economically,
sometimes militarily. Both governments demand that individuals relinquish
freedom, independence and self-reliance, a sacrifice that "must be made" so
that victory can be achieved. In the end, neither nation nor society has
truly won.
The only winners are the oligarchs, who sing
words of loyalty to their respective camps, while acting in league from the
very beginning.
The oligarchs, who never intended to target each other in
the first place. Their target, their ONLY target, was the citizenry itself -
the dumbfounded masses now mesmerized with shock, awe and terror.
The false paradigm method and the Hegelian
dialectic are in full force today.
Only a few years ago, Russia, China and the
United States were considered close economic and political allies. Today,
those alliances are being quickly scrapped in order to make room for
conflict, a conflict useful only to a select international elite.
As outlined in numerous articles,
including,
...when one looks beyond all the theatrical
rhetoric being thrown around between
Barack Obama and
Vladimir Putin, the
ultimate reality is that the relationship of both governments to the
global
banking elite is the same.
During both of Obamas Presidential terms, he
has flooded his cabinet with current and former
employees of Goldman Sachs, a longtime proving ground for elitist
financiers with globalist aspirations.
And who is the primary economic adviser to
Vladimir Putin and the Russian state? Why
Goldman Sachs, of course!
U.S. and European elites have been calling for a
centralization of economic power under the control of the International
Monetary Fund, as a well as a
new
global currency.
Not surprisingly, Putin also wants a new
global currency under the control of the IMF.
Obama is closely advised by globalists like
Zbigniew Brzezinski, a member of the
Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and cofounder of the
Trilateral Commission (TC), who in his book
'Between Two Ages - America's
Role in the Technetronic Era'
states:
"The nation-state is gradually yielding its
sovereignty
[F]urther progress will require greater American
sacrifices. More intensive efforts to shape a new world monetary
structure will have to be undertaken, with some consequent risk to the
present relatively favorable American position
"
As long as he has been in power, Putin has been
closely advised by
Henry Kissinger, yet another member of the CFR and proponent of the
Trilateral Commission, who
has said:
"In the end, the political and economic
systems can be harmonized in only one of two ways:
-
by creating an
international political regulatory system with the same reach as that of
the economic world
-
by shrinking the economic units to a size
manageable by existing political structures, which is likely to lead to
a new mercantilism, perhaps of regional units
A new Bretton Woods kind
of global agreement is by far the preferable outcome
"
Both Kissinger and Brzezinski refer to this
harmonized global economic and political structure as the "New World Order."
The fact that the political leaders of Russia and the United States are
clearly being directed by such men should not be taken lightly. China, too, has made demands for a restructuring
of the global monetary system into a
centralized currency basket under the dominance of the IMF.
Chinas
ties to the banking elite of London are well documented.
The call on both sides for a new monetary system
and the end of the dollar as world reserve seems to greatly contradict the
fantasy that the East and West are fundamentally at odds. The progression
towards a world currency and/or economic governance also appears to be
growing along with the consolidation of economic and military ties between
Eastern nations.
This would suggest that the rise of the East and the
crippling of Western elements is actually advantageous
to global bankers in
the long term.
While disinformation agents and media shills
have attempted to downplay any danger to the strength of America and the
dollar, Eastern governments have been swiftly establishing alliances and
decoupling from U.S. influence.
The historic 30-year
Russia/China gas deal has, of course, been finalized. This deal is
already eating up market space and influencing the way in which the energy
trade traditionally behaves.
China and Russia have also
expanded on their bilateral
agreements made in 2010, which remove the dollar as the reserve currency
in transactions between the two nations.
Chinas thirst for gold continues, while the
country is now building its own
gold exchange to rival the U.S. Comex.
Russia has recently established what Putin calls
the Eurasian Economic Union (EaEU), a deal which includes Kazakhstan and Belarus,
two countries that hold large, freshly discovered
oil fields.
In response to the engineered
conflict over
Ukraine, as well as the "Asian-Pacific Pivot" by the U.S., China has openly
called for a new
security pact with Russia and Iran.
Lets also not forget that China is set to
surpass the U.S. as the
worlds largest economy by 2016, according to the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
While the rise of the East is being painted in
Western circles as a threat to U.S. and NATO dominance, the bigger picture
is being hidden from view.
Yes, indeed, the consolidation of the East is a
considerable threat to the dollar and the U.S. economy - most importantly in
the event that China refuses to accept dollars as payment on exports and
debts. With the worlds largest exporter/importer refusing to take dollars
as a reserve, most nations will inevitably follow their lead.
The argument
against this development is, of course, that there is no rational trigger
for such a violent fiscal attack.
I would remind skeptics that there was no
rational trigger for the current strengthened relations between Russia and
China until the Ukraine crisis.
-
Is anyone really foolish enough to bet
against another direct or indirect conflict between NATO and the East?
-
And
is anyone really ignorant enough to assume that said event would not be used
as an excuse to cut the legs out from under the dollar completely?
The New World Order players have positioned the
East and West for just such a scenario.
Why? In
'Who Is The New Secret Buyer Of U.S. Debt?', I give evidence
indicating that the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and the IMF are
preparing the financial world for a new global monetary system, brought into
existence by a second Bretton Woods conference.
The debasement of the dollar
and the rise of the East are NOT obstacles to this plan. Rather, they are
required factors. There can be no truly global economic system without
"harmonization", the demise of the dollar's world reserve status, and the
end of sovereign economic governance.
For those who doubt this scenario, read Paul
Volckers latest statement (on May 21 at the annual meeting of the
Bretton Woods Committee), as reported by
Zero Hedge:
"By now I think we can agree that the
absence of an official, rules-based cooperatively managed, monetary
system has not been a great success. In fact, international financial
crises seem at least as frequent and more destructive in impeding
economic stability and growth."
Volcker, the same man who was directly involved
in the destruction of the first Bretton Woods agreement and the final death
rattle of the gold standard, is now promoting a NEW Bretton Woods-style
agreement in which currencies are pegged to a controlled market system - in
essence, a centralized international monetary system.
Volcker also suggests
that a single nation-based reserve currency like the dollar may be a danger
to overall fiscal health.
Volcker is right. The dollar-dominated forex
casino and fiat fraud is a danger to the world. Volcker helped make it that
way! And what a surprise, the former Federal Reserve chairman has a solution
on a silver platter for the American people - all we need is GLOBAL
centralization and bureaucratic oversight.
The propaganda is being carefully planted within
the mainstream.
Christine Lagarde of
the IMF now spends the whole of her
media interviews inserting the phrase "global economic reset" without
explaining exactly what that would entail, while central banking elites like
Volcker suggest a Bretton Woods II conference leading to a global monetary
authority.
In the meantime, Russian government-funded media outlets like RT
produce pieces
accusing the U.S. of being a nuclear menace while we Americans get to
watch manipulative Hollywood films like
"Jack Ryan - Shadow Recruit," which depicts a Russian plot to collapse
the U.S. economy.
China and U.S. representatives
squabble with each other at geopolitical meetings fueling fears of
diplomatic breakdown, while the Pentagon "suggests" they may have to revamp
their military strategies in
consideration of yet another World War.
Just as in Orwell's book,
1984,
old enemies become allies and then enemies once again, and at the top of the
pyramid, it's all a farce.
The best lies contain elements of truth. The
truth here is that the East is forming alliances in opposition to the West,
the West is involved in underhanded covert operations all over the planet,
and both "sides" are in fact on the verge of a catastrophic battle for
supremacy.
The great lie is that important details have been left out of our
little story.
Both sides are merely puppet pieces in a grand
game of global chess, and any conflict will ultimately benefit the small
group of men standing over the board.
They include the international financiers who
have influenced the very policy fabric of each government toward a climactic
crisis which they hope will finally give them the "New World Order" they
have always dreamed of.
