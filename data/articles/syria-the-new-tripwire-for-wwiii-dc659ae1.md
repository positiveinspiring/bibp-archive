Russian Rear Admiral Andrei Baranov has disclosed that 10 Russian warships
are already anchored at the Syrian port of Tartus. Russian engineering crews
are widening and dredging the port to accommodate additional Russian
warships.
The Russians are making clear their intentions of using the large Russian
naval presence in Tartus as a deterrent to Israeli air strikes against Syria
using the powerful anti-air missiles on-board the Russian naval warships.
These missile systems can sweep the sky over most of Syria and knock down
Israeli F-15 and F-16 fighters. This changes the balance of power in the air
over Syria.
This also places a tripwire for World War III in place in the Middle East.
Any attack on Iran will also involve a war with Syria and Lebanon. This will
now involve Russian military forces in direct support of the Iranian/Syrian
alliance. Russia is a major nuclear power with the power to destroy every
American and NATO city.
George Bush has just agreed to sell Israel 1,000
very advanced American bunker buster bombs for use in the coming war with
Iran, Syria, and Lebanon.
The neo-cons are going to get most of us killed.
