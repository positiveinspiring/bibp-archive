Kissingers
definition of terrorism might surprise you. Then again, it might be exactly
what you thought it would be.
The clip below is from a 2007 AKBank convention
in Istanbul, Turkey held right before the annual Bilderberg Meeting which
took place there that same year.
In it, former National Security Advisor and
Secretary of State, as well as member of,
...among others,
Henry Kissinger can be seen
giving the following speech:
In the Middle East,
we live in a different world.
The nations do not
represent historic entities in the same sense that European nations did.
Turkey of course does, and Iran in a considerable extent does. But in
the region in between,
the borders were drawn by the victors of World War I on the basis
largely of what would facilitate their influence.
So therefore, the
identities of these countries, and of their borders, can be challenged
more easily.
What we in America
call terrorists are really groups of people that reject the
international system, and theyre trying to regroup it to a radical
Islamic fundamentalists kind.
Clearly Kissinger is saying that, because many
Middle Eastern countries do not have what appears to be in his view the
historical significance of older countries, they are wide open for attack,
regime change and re-ordering.
Only a few years later, we have witnessed the
Western-backed Arab Spring, which has turned over numerous North African
and Middle Eastern nations.
After nearly two years of semi-covertly arming
al Qaeda fighters in Syria, most recently
Western support and provision of arms
for Syrian Rebels (who
admittedly used
their own chemical weapons) are becoming public
knowledge now that a mythical red line has supposedly been crossed by
Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.
Remember how America freed
Egypt and
Libya? Well
Syria is wash, rinse, repeat.
On top of that, Kissinger is also saying the
word terrorist is really someone who would reject the international
system -
a
New World Order.
Part of that order appears to be American empire
building and the spreading of our nations brand of democracy throughout
the rest of the world
whether they like it or not.
How do you think someone with Kissingers
perspective would see American patriots who reject
the United Nations or
central
banking system?
Surely, he sees them as terrorists as well.
Further, if the State held similar views and
used the terrorist label - which is used in this country like screaming
fire! in a theater to circumvent the Constitution on a daily basis - such
resistors to the new world order would be instantly criminalized,
marginalized and marked for imprisonment or death.
