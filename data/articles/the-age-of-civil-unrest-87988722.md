All governments had better open their eyes for we are on the brink of a
major convergence between both the 'Cycle of Civil Unrest, Civil War &
Revolution' and 'International War.'
Both of these models converge and as I pointed
out at the
Cycles of War Conference, this is the first
time we have seen this convergence since the 1700s.
This is no plain modern event with civil unrest erupting because of an
interconnected world.
These are grassroots uprisings cross-fertilized
perhaps from a world contagion yet they often have similarities - corrupt
governments.
-
Turkey
-
Ukraine
-
Thailand
-
Venezuela
-
Bosnia-Herzegovina,
...are all middle-income democracies with elected leaders
besieged by people angry at misgovernment, corruption and economic
sclerosis.
These days it is no longer just dictators who have something to
fear from the crowd.
This is the promise of Marxism that centralized
planning and false promises are coming home and governments are too corrupt
and incompetent to deliver what they have claimed for decades.
-
Communism is dead.
-
The socialistic agendas that have lined
the pockets of government and filled the coffers of banks is over.
-
The national debts are on average
composed of 70% interest payments not programs to help the poor as
marketed.
-
The debts that keep growing with no
intent upon paying anyone back are draining the national
productivity and turning the people into economic slaves.
-
The standard of living has declined and
it now takes two incomes to survive where one use to be just fine.
-
Women won the right to work and lost the
right to stay home.
The promises that you save for the future have
collapsed into dust as interest rates have been driven lower making savings
utterly worthless.
There is no such thing as saving and living off
your fixed income. The elderly are being driven back into the work force and
the whole ideas that a generation believed in are vanishing before their
eyes.
So it is no longer communists and dictators that are the targets.
All governments are now the targets and when the
economy turns down after 2015, the threat of civilization will be pulled
apart by the self-interest of politicians clinging to power to the detriment
of the people.
