# Interview with Ex Illuminati Programmer 2 - 05

Svali: I just want you and your readers to know that
I am NOT an
Illuminati expert, nor do I want to be. I am only a survivor who was
part of this group, in a lower management position locally. I did
NOT rub elbows with the rich and famous, although I heard about
things that occurred at higher levels (people do gossip even in the
cult, they're still human beings).
There are other people who have come out and disclosed. I don't know
them personally, but I have heard about them. One is Brice Taylor,
in California and North Carolina (she lives part time in both
places). Another is
Neil Brick of
SmartNews, he seems to be very
real and believable and a nice person. Others are Caryn StarDancer,
of
Survivorship.org, and Annie McKenna (I think she even wrote a
book about her experiences [ed. 'Paperclip Dolls'], it is quite
good). There are others, and if you go to the Suite101.com site,
there are links to resources and also survivor pages.
Survivorship.org also has links.
Some survivors have self-published their stories on the web, to help
the public know that this is going on. I am only one person among
many who has come out to talk about my experiences, and my
experiences are limited to what one person did in the Washington, DC
area and the San Diego, Ca. area between 1957 and 1995. A person who
was doing their job at the time, was very misguided, and who is now
heartily sorry for the things that I once participated in.
Q: How do survivors remain anonymous after seeking help? Would the
cult not go to extreme measures to find and silence programmers or
members that have left the cult? To what ends would they go to shut
you up?
A: At Suite 101, and in my book, I wrote a whole chapter on staying
safe. Here's the URL for the Suite 101 article:
Breaking Free of the
Cult. It includes tips on staying safe.
Yes, they do try to recontact people who get out. The first way they
do this is through their family (remember they are transgenerational).
My mother told me to "come back or die" four years ago, which
triggered off lethal self destruct programming inside (I believe she
was counting on my coming back, but she was wrong and I almost died.
God spared my life). I then had to go in and dismantle it all. When
I left, the head trainer was pretty arrogant. He had said I would be
dead within 6 months if I remembered, because "no one could remember
with what I put in her and live". Direct quote from Jonathan M.,
head trainer, and I hope he reads this article.
Second, a lot of people get abducted and reaccessed because they :
phone their perps, go out alone at night (you wouldn't believe the
stories I have heard from survivors who told me they went out at 2
or 3 am to the store, alone, walking down alleys. What were they
thinking????).
I helped one survivor get out three years ago, she was being
harassed by the group, and was fighting back, she literally pulled
a gun on a would-be abductor and he backed away (he had his gun out)
when she asked him, "and who of the two of us do you think is the
better shot?" She was an expert marksman). She stayed with me for 6
months, and is free of the group.
They usually do give up after awhile, and get tired of trying to
pull people back. I could never live in San Diego, or DC, though.
The chances of running into an old trainer or someone I knew would
be too great. Instead, having physical distance (people in the cult
in this state don't know me or care about me one way or the other)
helps. I also have tons of accountability. These people like
secrecy, and won't usually act out in public if someone is with
people who aren't part of their group. I have heard of people being
assassinated , which is one reason that I don't go on T.V., or speak
publicly. I live very quietly and anonymously out here. MOST cult
recontact comes because the person recontacts, though. The pull to
go back is enormous at times, and has to be fought a lot, especially
in the first years. To find out why someone would go back to their
abusers, read my article on "Trauma Bonding: The Pull to the
Perpetrator" at Suite 101.
Q: I want to get back to the
Illuminati's political agenda. What is
the connection between the CIA, FBI, and other secret services and
the cult? To what degree are they infiltrated? And what is the real
agenda of these secret services?
A: They are all infiltrated. I don't think everyone in these groups
are Illuminists, but a lot of the leadership is. An example: my
mother was friends with Sid Gottlieb, who was part of the
CIA. The
farm I grew up on was only about a half hour away from his home in
Culpeper, Va. She also knew the Dulles family. A lot of the
researchers in the CIA were part of it, and I visited
Langley, Va.
at intervals growing up. MK-Ultra was funded in part with Illuminati
money. These people use the most sophisticated mind control
techniques on their members, believe me.
When I was in San Diego, human experimentation was still going on.
Jonathan and I were investigating the effects of certain drugs on
inducing trance states and assisting with programming. We would take
the data, and download it into a database (oh, yes, the cult is very
technologically sophisticated) and then send it to Langley.
Many of the administrators and directors at the FBI
are also
Illuminists. The CIA helped bring over german scientists after WWII.
Many of these were also Illuminati leaders in their own country, and
they were welcomed with open arms by the U.S. group. They also funnelled all information they were learning to the Illuminati.
Q: I assume if the U.S. political, banking, and military systems are
all fairly well under Illuminati control this would then also be
true for Eastern Europe, Russia and other communist bloc countries
as well. What does this mean for relations between the West-East
axis? Was Russia, or the USSR at the time, ever the adversary it was
made out to be, and was there a grand plan behind having Russia as
an enemy?
A: Russia was never really a threat to us.
Marxism was funded by the
Illuminati, and espoused as a counterbalance to capitalism.
The Illluminati believe strongly in balancing opposing forces, in the
pull between opposites. They see history as a complex chess game,
and they will fund one side, then another, while ultimately out of
the chaos and division ..., they are laughing because they are
ultimately beyond political parties. A top western financier will
secretly meet with an eastern or russian "adversary" during those
years, and have a good laugh at how the "sheep" were being deluded.
I am sharing here what I was taught, and also observed.
When
DELPHI met with ORACLE in Europe, (these are the
head training
groups for the northern hemisphere and european continents) the
Russian, German, French, British, Canadian, and US trainers all
worked together. In fact, this is one reason why plurality of linguality is valued in
the Illuminati. I had to learn six languages
as a child, and learn to converse with people from around the world.
They are truly an international group, and the group's agenda supercedes any nationalistic feelings. There is also a lot of
trading back and forth of members in these groups. A russian trainer
might come to the US for awhile, complete a job, then go back, or
vice-versa.
Q: China is starting to rattle their sabers and arming itself with
nuclear weapons which are pointing at U.S. cities. Is all this
occurring according to Illuminati agenda or is there still a fairly
large 'uncertainty, random or x-factor' involved that is beyond the
Illuminati's control?
A: I have been out for five years, so my information is "old news".
But the military buildup of China is part of their plan. There are
members of the group who are Asian, and very opportunistic. The
Oriental Mafia groups are very much linked to Illuminati activity.
The random factor in all of this is how the average citizen reacts.
It can't be predicted, although Illuminati leadership will often
invent different scenarios, and try to decide how they will act if
the ordinary citizens react in an unexpected manner.
I was told that
around 2020, the Illuminist agenda would be revealed
openly. I don't know if this is accurate, or just propaganda that I
was taught, or if they have changed this date since I was in the
group.
Q: Svali, earlier you were talking about
mindcontrol victims and
survivors that have come forward with their stories and
publicized
it. One of the more recent and high profile stories is the one of
Cathy O'Brian [see links at
http://www.vegan.swinternet.co.uk/articles/conspiracies/cathyandmark.html
and
http://www.trance-formation.com/]. She seems to be more of a
CIA mind control victim, which still sound very much like your own
story, in terms of technology and technique. Do you think there
could be an Illuminati connection?
A: As I mentioned before, the
CIA and the Illuminati are definitely
linked. The top leadership in the CIA are also Illuminati leaders. I
mentioned Dulles and Gottlieb as men I knew personally as a child
and young adult. The scientists that ran the MK-Ultra and other
governmental mind control programs were Illuminists brought over
from Nazi Germany. That's why you will find that mind control
victims ALWAYS speak German or have a dissociated part that speaks
with a German accent; they are mimicking their abusers, which is
very very common.
You could say that the CIA and the
Illuminati are hand in glove
companions. I know that the different Illuminati groups around the
US also send data on the experiments they do to the central computer
at Langley, Va. (oh, yes, human experimentation and mind control
experiments are still ongoing, it didn't stop with WWII...).
