NSA Whistleblower William Blinney Tells
All
NY Times Op-Docs - The Program
- The Program -
The filmmaker Laura Poitras
profiles William Binney,
a 32-year veteran of the
National Security Agency
who helped design a
top-secret program he says
is broadly collecting
Americans personal data.
It took me a few days to work up the nerve to
phone William Binney.
As someone
already a target" of the United States government, I found it difficult
not to worry about the chain of unintended consequences I might unleash by
calling Mr. Binney, a 32-year veteran of the National Security Agency
(NSA),
turned whistle-blower.
He picked up. I nervously explained I was a
documentary filmmaker and wanted to speak to him.
To my surprise he replied:
Im tired of my government harassing me and
violating the Constitution. Yes, Ill talk to you.
Two weeks later, driving past the headquarters
of the NSA in Maryland, outside Washington, Mr. Binney described details
about
Stellar Wind, the NSAs top-secret domestic spying program begun
after 9/11, which was so controversial that it nearly caused top Justice
Department officials to
resign in
protest, in 2004.
The decision must have been made in
September 2001, Mr. Binney told me and the cinematographer Kirsten
Johnson. Thats when the equipment started coming in.
In this Op-Doc, Mr. Binney explains how the
program he created for foreign intelligence gathering was turned inward on
this country.
He resigned over this in 2001 and began
speaking out publicly in the last year. He is among a group of NSA
whistle-blowers, including Thomas A. Drake, who have each risked everything
- their freedom, livelihoods and personal relationships - to warn Americans
about the dangers of NSA domestic spying.
To those who understand state surveillance as an
abstraction, I will try to describe a little about how it has affected me.
The United States apparently placed me on a
"watch-list in 2006 after I completed a film about the Iraq war. I have
been detained at the border more than 40 times.
Once, in 2011, when I was stopped at John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York and asserted my First Amendment
right not to answer questions about my work, the border agent replied,
If you dont answer our questions, well
find our answers on your electronics.
As a filmmaker and journalist entrusted to
protect the people who share information with me, it is becoming
increasingly difficult for me to work in the United States.
Although I take every effort to secure my
material, I know the NSA has technical abilities that are nearly
impossible to defend against if you are targeted.
The 2008 amendments to the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which oversees the NSA
activities, are up for renewal in December.
Two members of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence, Senators
Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, both Democrats, are
trying to revise the amendments to insure greater privacy protections.
They have been warning about
"secret interpretations" of laws and backdoor loopholes that allow the
government to collect our private communications. Thirteen senators have
signed a letter expressing concern about a loophole in the law that
permits the collection of United States data.
The A.C.L.U. and other groups have also
challenged the constitutionality of the law, and the Supreme Court
will
hear arguments in that case on October 29 (2012).

As the anniversary of
9/11 approaches, instead
of listening to mainstream media and government propaganda about what
happened that day, and how all of the police state measures that have
followed have made us more free, we should continue to uncover the lies of
what really happened.
Now that the entire police state apparatus has obviously turned inward, as
admitted in numerous government announcements and
reports
that are putting everyday Americans on
terror watch lists, whistleblowers are stepping forward to reveal just
how extensive and ongoing the surveillance has been.
Instead of being
heralded for their patriotism, these
whistleblowers are being persecuted by the U.S. government.
However, key insiders such as
Sibel Edmonds,
Susan Lindauer, and
Thomas Drake (below video) have prevailed to reveal a startling amount of
information that should concern any American who values civil liberties:
Former top NSA mathematician and code breaker, William Binney, has
gone on record to publicly reveal the scope of a top-secret surveillance
program that has directly targeted everyday Americans following 9/11.
He is sounding an alarm about the massive scope
of this project that engages in 24/7 warrantless wiretapping of the American
population.
Surveillance and data collection of the U.S. population has been in the
making for some time, perhaps best known through programs like
ECHELON, but to have a
32-year, top-level veteran of the NSA reveal in the
video at top of the page, the domestic
component of a program code named
Stellar Wind, and his concerns that we are
heading down the road to totalitarianism if not brought under control,
should be a wake-up call to those who still believe that we are immune from
the treatment that has been dished out across the rest of the planet.
Blinney has previously stated that the U.S. government retains "most" e-mail
communications. In an interview with documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras
published by The New York Times (itself the
source of leaks
to intelligence agencies)
A clearly fed-up Blinney begins by stating:
Im tired of my government harassing me and
violating the Constitution. Yes, Ill talk to you.
He goes further to trace the origins and methods
of a program which led to his resignation, as well as many other Justice
Department officials, and the subsequent harassment he endured by his own
government.
He states that the scope of the data collection
forms a map that can,
"show your entire life over time."
The NSA is set to complete
its $2 billion
fortress of domestic surveillance by September 2013 that, as Blinney
says, can store 100 years worth of electronic information.
Coupled with the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act up for renewal in December, insiders and citizens alike
need to have the courage to confront the NSA betrayal of the very people
whose money is funding their increasing power.
