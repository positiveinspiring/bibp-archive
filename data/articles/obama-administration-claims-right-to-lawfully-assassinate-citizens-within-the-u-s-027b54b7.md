According to the Obama administration, the
president has the right to assassinate American citizens within the United
States, without charges or any legal process.
This claim, contained in a letter from Attorney
General
Eric Holder, constitutes the most far-reaching abrogation of
constitutional rights and is aimed at establishing the pseudo-legal
framework for military rule.
Holders letter, the first explicit assertion of a power to extrajudicially
kill Americans in their homes, was in response to a question delivered to
the Obama
administration from Republican Senator Rand Paul.
In testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee on Wednesday, Holder reiterated and expanded on this position,
declaring that the authorization to use military force in
the war on
terror extends to the United States.
In the letter to Paul, Holder responds to a question as to whether,
the
President has the power to authorize lethal force, such as a drone strike,
against a US citizen on US soil, and without trial.
Holders answers are a series of evasions and absurd rationalizations.
He
repeats the statement made repeatedly by the administration before, that
the,
US government has not carried out drone
strikes in the United States and has no intention to do so.
He adds that,
as a matter of policy - that is, not as a
matter of legality - we reject the use of military force where
well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the
best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat.
In other words, under circumstances where the
executive branch and military decide that police action is not the best
means of responding to an undefined threat, the military will be deployed
to kill people at will.
Holder then declares that under undefined extraordinary circumstances, the
president could,
authorize the military to use lethal force
within the territory of the United States.
As two examples of such circumstances, Holder
cites the attack on
Pearl Harbor in 1941 and
the attacks of September 11,
2001.
The comparisons are absurd. Pearl Harbor involved a full-scale attack by the
Japanese military on Hawaii. At issue, however, is not a response to a
military invasion, but the claim that the administration has the right to
assassinate American citizens in the United States who are not engaged in
any hostile actions.
The administration has already killed at least
three US citizens abroad, including Anwar al-Awlaki and his 16-year-old son.
As for
September 11, the circumstances behind these attacks have yet to be
explained, but involved a number of individuals who were being followed by
US intelligence agencies.
Holders letter is a sweeping declaration of the ability to deploy the
military in the United States in response to an emergency connected to
some past or allegedly future attack. Under such conditions, the military
would be given unrestricted powers and the Bill of Rights rendered a dead
letter.
Holder expanded his remarks in the course of testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, in which the bipartisan support for the
assault on democratic rights was on display.
In the course of the testimony, senators from both parties largely avoided
the issue or praised Holder and the administration.
Democratic Senator
Dianne Feinstein, who is also the chair of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, declared that the legal opinions prepared by the administration
on assassinating US citizens were very thoughtful, very impressive and
urged that all of them be made available to the judiciary committee.
She added that deploying military force within
the United States against US citizens was something we have to grapple
with.
The greatest praise for Holder came from Senator
Lindsey Graham,
Republican from South Carolina, who is close to the military and
intelligence apparatus. Graham lauded the administrations efforts to
defend the homeland, singling out the drone assassination program in
particular.
Then the following exchange took place:
Graham: It is a longstanding proposition in
American law that an American citizen who joins forces with our enemies
can be considered an enemy combatant, do you agree with that?
Holder: Yes.
Graham: Hypothetically, if there are Patriot missile batteries around
this capitol and other key government infrastructure, to protect the
capitol from an attack, it would be lawful for those batteries to
launch, is that correct?
Holder: Yes
Graham: When we say that Congress gave every administration the
authorization to use military force against Al Qaeda, we didnt exempt
the homeland, did we?
Holder: No, I dont think we did
The conclusion:
Anyone declared by the president to be an
enemy combatant, including American citizens in the United States, can
be summarily executed without any judicial review.
In referring to American citizens who have
joined forces with the enemy, Graham cited individuals who supported
Germany in the Second World War, with which Holder readily agreed.
Again, the historical comparison is absurd. Even
so, the traditional response of the state under such conditions is to try
individuals for treason, in which their alleged crimes must be proven. Now
the government asserts the right to act as judge, jury and executioner.
Grahams introduction of the hypothetical deployment of Patriot missiles by
the military around the capitol and other critical institutions makes clear
that what is being contemplated is the full militarization of American
society.
There were a number of other significant exchanges.
Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who like Paul is
a right-wing libertarian and Tea Party-backed Republican, asked Holder
whether the president had the constitutional authority to assassinate an
American citizen in the United States with a drone while that person was
sitting quietly in a cafe.
On four occasions, Holder said such action would not be appropriate,
deliberately avoiding a statement that it would not be legal. In response to
repeated questioning from Cruz, Holder finally indicated that his reference
to such action not being appropriate should be translated as a no -
apparently suggesting that it would not be constitutional.
This statement, however, was conditioned on the premise that the person
involved did not pose an imminent threat.
The requirement of imminence is also included
in the administrations white paper on assassinating US citizens abroad;
however, this is essentially meaningless. The document states that imminence
does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific
attack on US persons and interests will take place in the immediate future.
Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, asked Holder,
Do you believe Congress has the
constitutional authority to pass a law prohibiting the president from
using US drones against US citizens?
Holder replied that in his view such a law
would not be constitutional as it would run contrary to the Article II
powers of the executive branch - that is to say, the section relating to
the presidents authority as commander-in-chief of the military.
Politicians of both parties are participating in a conspiracy against the
most basic democratic rights.
Earlier this week, the Senate Intelligence
Committee voted 12 to 3 in favor of the nomination of John Brennan -
the individual most closely associated with the assassination program - to
head the CIA. All Democrats voted in favor.
Holders comments aroused almost no comment from
the American media.
On the evening news Wednesday, the story was
almost entirely buried, with only brief reference to a filibuster stunt
carried out by Paul, a right-wing libertarian Republican, against the
nomination of Brennan. The abrogation of the Bill of Rights provokes little
more than a few raised eyebrows.
The essential target of these measures is the emergence of domestic
opposition within the United States to the policies of the financial
aristocracy that controls both big-business parties.
Under conditions of deepening polarization, and
as the ruling class is implementing measures that are overwhelmingly opposed
by the vast majority of the population, the government is actively preparing
dictatorial forms of rule.
