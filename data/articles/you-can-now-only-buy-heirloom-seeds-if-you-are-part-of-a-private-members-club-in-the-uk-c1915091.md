Club in The UK

The way we are being pushed and squeezed by regulations that govern
every facet of our life we will soon only be able to defecate when our
allotted time slot comes around.
The European Commission is currently
drawing up a new law to regulate the sale of all seeds, plants and plant
material.
The latest draft of the law is even more restrictive than
the regulations that we have at the moment.
Every single variety of vegetable will have to be registered on
an EU list, otherwise it will be illegal to sell it.
To be
registered on the list, seed varieties have to pass a series of
tests demonstrating what is called DUS Distinctiveness, Uniformity
and Stability. It costs nearly Â£3000 to test & register just one
single variety of seed for sale.
Although we have had a system like this for many years, there have
been much simpler and cheaper options for what are considered amateur
varieties for home gardeners, and the rules have never been strictly
enforced in the UK.
The EU wants to get rid of these simpler and cheaper rules for
amateur seed, and make sure that every country enforces the rules
100%.
Although they say there will be exceptions, in current drafts of the
law these are very, very limited.
The effect of this new legislation will be to massively limit the
choice of vegetable varieties available to home gardeners.
This is because if you are selling seed to farmers, you can expect to
sell hundreds of tonnes of seed every year, so it is worth the cost of
registering the variety. But if you are selling to gardeners, even the
biggest seed companies will be selling a few kilos of seed at most,
sometimes just a few hundred grams of more unusual varieties.
It
just doesnt work if they have to pay thousands of pounds to register
that variety! So only seed designed for farmers will get registered and
be legally sellable.
Unfortunately, varieties suitable for farmers often arent
appropriate for home gardeners and allotment growers. For example:
farmers usually want all of their produce to come ready at the same
time, so that they can harvest and sell a whole fields worth.
Home
gardeners usually want their crops to mature over a longer period - we
dont want to eat all our vegetables on one day!
Another example: farmers generally dont want to grow climbing peas,
as they need supports and cant be harvested mechanically. Lots of home
gardeners prefer tall pea varieties, as they are more productive in a
small space. There are hundreds of examples like this - the needs of
gardeners and farmers are very different.
The problem is very simple:
If these new laws are passed, there will
be fewer and fewer varieties developed for gardeners and small growers.
Everybody will have to grow varieties that have been designed for
commercial large-scale farming, whether they like it or not.
Happily, for the time being at least there is a way around this. You
start a seed club, and that way a seed company cannot be prosecuted for
selling to the public
they are not they are selling to their members
only!
Real
Seeds, a non-profit heirloom seed company in the UK have started
their own seed club. For the princely sum of one penny a year, which is
deducted from your first order, you are a member of the club and can
therefore buy your seeds without them getting prosecuted. I say them
because it is not illegal to buy heirloom seeds for veggies not on the
approved list, but it is illegal for anyone to sell them commercially to
the public at large.
This will change of course as soon as the
New World Order Thugs in
Brussels realize whats gong on. You can read about the seed club
here.

I should just point out that I have no connection with The Real Seed
Company, other than as a customer, sorry, club member
I am told by a friend that
Heirloom Organics is a reputable US company that sell genuine
heirloom seeds, I cant say one way or the other as I have never brought
seed from them, but I do trust my informant.
Get together with friends and start a seed swap circle to increase
the varieties of seeds that you hold. Diversity will become a very
important aspect of future food growing and the more diverse your seed
stocks the better.
