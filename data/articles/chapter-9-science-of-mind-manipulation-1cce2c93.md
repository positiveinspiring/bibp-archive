CHAPTER 9
THE SCIENCE OF MIND
MANIPULATION BY PSYCHOLOGICAL PROGRAMMING METHODS: BEHAVIOR
MODIFICATION, PSYCHOLOGICAL MOTIVATION & NLP
One way to explain how the slaves are
conditioned is to relate an episode where the. two authors observed a
Satanic family carrying out conditioning to reinforce their childrens
mind control as their family ate at a restaurant. After relating this
interesting incident, the chapter will cover the various psychological
methods used to condition slaves.
OBSERVATIONS OF A SATANIC FAMILY CARRYING
OUT MONARCH CONDITIONING ON THEIR CHILDREN.
The husband of the family was about 28 and
the wife was about 26. A young man (perhaps an uncle of the children)
about 25 also sat at the table with them. The family had 5 children,
ranging from about 1 1/2 years old to about 7 years old. During the
entire time we watched them, which was over an hour, we never saw one
act of love, not one act of nurturing on the part of the parents.
Everything was programming, programming and more programming. The
husband had an attitude of control over his children. He was a young
somewhat wild cock-sure type. From piecing together things it was clear
that he made a good salary and that he and his wife enjoyed profanity.
His wife had the most dead looking eyes we have ever seen in a person.
She looked every bit the part of a Satanic priestess of the worst type.
The young man of about 25 had very large
knife hidden on his back that we noticed only by close observation of
his movements. Although it was 1 oclock, the adults were calling their
meal breakfast.
The main male child was about 5 years
old. He had an older sister and two younger sisters, and they all had a
baby brother. During the entire time that the family was there, the
children ate almost nothing. The 5 yr. boy munched on a
watermelon rind, trying to draw some sustenance from it. Part of mind
control is depriving the body of food. The poor children never once
asked for anything; that is a clue that something wasnt normal.
During
most of the time that the family was in the restaurant, the mother and
father took turns shooting one question after another at the five year
boy. The questions were like:
What is the capital of Florida? What is the
70th element on the periodical chart? What are the names of the first
five presidents? What is the square root of 121? The boy would roboticly
answer each question successfully. The questions were not questions but
programming and commands.
The mother sternly said, What make of car was
that? Thats a question. (Actually what she was saying was a command.)
Around this time they said, Wake up, wake up, wake up. (hypnotic
command.) A couple which was in the restaurant was watching how obedient
the children were, and they were also overhearing how excellent this
little boy could answer difficult rapid-fire questions. They were
impressed and the lady came over to tell the parents how wonderful their
family was.
After oodling for 10 minutes over how great this family was
the woman went on to other things. It was difficult for both of us
watching to stomach the compliments this stranger was giving to these
parents. The natural impulse was to get her to shut up her compliments.
She naively made all these compliments little knowing, that these
parents were practicing one of the most hideous if not the most hideous
type of mind control invented. Asking questions rapid fire is another
mind-control technique. In fact, all of the elements of what Fritz
watched at the table that day were practiced on Fritz, the co-author,
when he was in Beast Barracks at West Point, USMA.
The little girl was
repeating her programming, I dont have anything inside me. She was
actually singing it. One of the girls had different alters coming out
and was having a conversation with herself between different alters
(personalities). She placed her hand over her temple in scarecrow
fashion (Wizard of Oz) programming. Her head movement was a dead
giveaway to those of us familiar with Monarch programming. -The parents
had chosen the spot to eat because of the large surreal picture above
them on the wall with blue & red flowers, water and mountains.
The
picture was acting as a scrambling-scattering mechanism, when the boy
studied the picture, which he did for the longest time in a trance. The
middle girl was dropping crayons into a styrofoam cup and saying get
into the fire. Then she would say Im purple. Im pink. I
understand your purple. I understand youre pink. Get out of here
for a minute. What she was doing was giving the crayons personalities.
In the Monarch programming, the person is totally dehumanized so that
some alters think they are ribbons, some monkeys, some clowns, some
dolls, some trees, some lions or tigers, etc. The sexual alters are
often programmed to think of themselves as cats and butterflies.
While
the girl was coloring, her father reached over the table without warning
and took her colors, You dont deserve these colors and I should have
taken them away before now. The girl had done nothing wrong. This is
part of mind control. The person learns that there isnt a right or
wrong only that they must be obedient. The little girl did not even
respond when her colors were yanked away. When the mom talked to them,
she said children--she never once personalized things. The parents
began another programming session and said something like, I will spank
you. If you dont count then you can be spanked, we will count 20
times.
The constant double messages were obviously breaking down the
children to think as programmed rather than respond like normal people
to the outside world. The woman turned to her little baby and said,
Tell daddy good-bye. When the child waved good-bye, the woman snapped,
You're not going anywhere. This serves to create confusion. Then she
kissed him and said, Baby, do you want a picture? We decided to say
something to them, and we did so in the form of a compliment about their
children. Neither parent showed any pride in the children when the
earlier lady had gushedly complimented the children, nor when we
complimented them with a sentence. Instead, when we complimented the
children, the father began shooting off a series of difficult questions
to the boy.
This was simply more programming, but apparently he must
have thought that wed be impressed with the boys ability to answer
difficult questions that seemed way beyond what many teenagers would
know. Two strange things happened during the course of our verbal
interaction with this satanic family. First, the waitresses had given
the family free ice cream coupons, but the parents gave them to us
without the children even batting an eyelid. Second, I asked the father
what the age of his children were and he didnt know, or acted like he
didnt know.
Then he blurted out, they are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
years old. His wife knew that that answer must have looked bogus to us,
and she reprimanded him, You dont even know the age of your children.
To which he replied, Yes, they are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The second answer
was equally implausible, but his wife didnt protest, and the poor mind
controlled children were experiencing just one more element of Satanic
mind-control. They are not even allowed to realize how old they are.
Dates, and times, and ages are kept very confused in the childrens
minds for secrecy and control. Not only that, but by giving a hypnotic
induction 1, 2, 3... the father had lowered each of the alters which
were holding the bodies of his children into a deeper trance. With these
alters tranced, another word from the father could have easily pulled up
other alters.
OTHER ITEMS THAT PARENTS DO TO THEIR
MONARCH CHILDREN
Double bind communication is commonly given
multiples by all of their abusers. Some of these double binds are well
thought out and some just occur due to the craziness of the entire
thing. For instance, in ritual or programming, the child may have the
option to stab or be stabbed. In fighting the programming, if an alter
goes toward health, the programmers have set in a booby-trap. Which evil
does the slave live with--the lies of the programming or the lies of the
external world? How does one tell the truth to a therapist, when the
therapist is not capable of hearing the truth, and yet still demands to
be told the truth? Yes, double-binds abound. Another trick is to
alternate leniency with harshness. This trick is done in the military
also, and has been worked with success by the Chinese government upon
the people of Red China.
When leniency is alternated with kindness, the
effect is devastating and disconcerting because the person looses the
ability to predict what is going to happen. Everyone likes to control
his or her life. Predicting what is going to happen is part of a
persons mind gaining control over their environment. Even that control
is stripped from a slave. They soon learn to quit trying to protect
themselves, and they quit trying to think for themselves but docilely
submit to whatever fate assigns them. The mind cant figure life out, so
it quits trying to understand life, and just fatally submits.
Dr. Green
(Mengele) was very gentle when drawing blood, and he was very gentle
when giving the children X-rays. He would sweet talk them and give
candy. But he was very sadistic when hed follow this up with abuse. The
programmers have preferred to be inconsistent with the children like
this. Soon the child doesnt know what hate and love are anymore. The
person, who claims he loves them, gives them torture or abandons them to
be tortured by someone else.
A third trick is to give the victim
monotonous tasks, such as chanting or copying long amounts of written
material. This helps prod the dissociation, and is a torture that
doesnt leave marks.
AN OVERVIEW
All of the elements of mind control are
incorporated into the Monarch program. If a person surveys what the
everyday cult mind control which is NOT part of total Monarch
mind-control looks like, you will find the same elements of everyday
cult control also are employed at various places within the Monarch
programming of a persons alter system. (This didnt happen by accident
either, the Illuminati have examined all these lesser cults to see what
they could borrow for their own mind control.) Some of the elements
which the Monarch program shares with other typical types of cult mind
control are:
1. THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE PROMISED TO
BE MET, BUT ARE IGNORED FOR GROUP GOALS.
The Illuminati handler (master) will promise
to meet individual needs of alters, but these needs are ignored for
group goals. For instance, certain Monarch alters of a persons system
may be told they have no faces and no hearts. They are programmed not to
see their faces and not to hear any heart beat. If a pulse monitoring
machine is hooked up to the alter, the alter will go into a trance. For
instance, the handler might promise faces and hearts but will never give
them to the Monarch slave when he could. The promise is a control
mechanism.
2. ISOLATION FROM THE WORLD, SO THAT THE
ONLY REALITY IS THE LEADERS REALITY.
The Illuminati isolates the slave
so no new ideas are available or allowed except their cult leaders ideas.
Whatever the Papa Bear [master] says is reality. Each alter will only
communicate with a few other alters. What this does is divide the person
from their own parts. The will and mind is broken so that there is no
organized resistance, nor any access to other alters who might know
something. The slave will often be denied mother, grandmother,
grandfather, aunts, sisters, children, grandchildren, & friends. They
will be deprived of all naturally occurring relationships via the mind
control. This doesnt mean they exist in a vacuum, it means that the
handlers will prevent natural relationships to develop. Isolation is
very key »» and parts are made to feel like animals rather than people
to isolate them from humanity. No ideas are allowed the slave to
confront their programmers lies. They are programmed to hate Christ and
the God of the Bible, so that they are isolated from the true God and
His abundant spiritual resources.
3. THE PERSONS SENSE OF IDENTITY IS LOST.
The Monarch slave loses his/her sense of self to the cult and to the
persons master. No sense of where I begin & end, and where the Master
begins and ends. The Monarch programming goes beyond what many cults have
done, the alters are hypnotized to not see their faces, which is part of
their identity.
4. ALTERED STATES & HYPNOSIS IS USED.
The
handlers/programmers use hypnotic techniques. They
induce dissociation
by songs, chanting, guilt inducing sessions, torture, isolation, as well
as using songs, repeating triggers 3X, and lots of hypnosis.
5. A SENSE OF PEACE IS INDUCED, ESPECIALLY
WHEN ONE MERGES WITH WHOEVER IS LEADING. THE HEAD OF THE CULT WILL TAKE
CREDIT FOR WHAT THE SLAVE IS.
They induce a sense of peace leading to
the fantasy of merging with leader, often suggested by leader. Then the
victim has the abuser placed internally in them. For example, the master
may say he was one with the slave and that he created the slave. The
handler will claim to be God.
6. OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCES.
Out of body
experiences (O-B-Es) are induced by the torture & Illuminati training,
as well as splits.
7. SENSORY BOMBARDMENT & FATIGUE.
Sensory
bombardment used, such as prolonged sleep deprivation, environmental
control, and love bombing. Cages, love bombing of certain alters, and a
sterile nursery/toddler room are employed.
8. CRITICAL THINKING AND DISAGREEING WITH
THE LEADER IS FORBIDDEN.
The slave must suspend ability to think
critically or disagree with leader. The slave must never question the
Master (also called the handler), never get angry at the handler, or
else the slave wants to be punished. The slave must always obey or pay
with pain. The alters are splintered from others so cant use their
information for analysis.
9. The slave must reorganize reality through
identification with aggressor (Illuminati master). Strong identification
is created with the master. The slave is programmed to protect the
master.
10. Individual sees locus (location) of
control with the Master and the Illuminati rather than self. Programming
overrules self.
11. Black and white thinking is created by
the programming. Many of the Gnostic cults (see Fritzs Be Wise As Serpents book for
an examination of what a Gnostic cult is) have employed these tactics.
People in the Jehovahs Witnesses and CUT, which are Gnostic cults, as
well as members of many other groups--such as the CIA will recognize
that these methods were used on them. (The CIA is in reality just
another cult, and an Illuminati-controlled cult at that.)
ISOLATION
For children who are being taken out of Day
Care Centers and programmed without their parents knowledge, they will
be isolated from their real parents. The abusers will tell the children
that they are actually the real parents and that they intend to come
and take the child away from its parents later. They will make the
innocent child feel like it is cut off and rejected by everyone
including the world at large. In a sense, this is true, because the
child is expected to endure the most horrible abuse and yet has no one
to talk to. Feelings of isolation and despair take control over the
childs mind. These ways of thinking are also spiritually enhanced by
rituals to bring in demonic spirits that will help insure the child is
dominated by feelings of hopelessness.
During the entire life of the
slave, the handlers and programmers are always trying to sow distrust in
the victim. The programming is often designed to sow distrust in
everyone on the outside except the godlike figure the Master. Even the
Master is not trusted so much as feared and obeyed by the slave. The
slave is also subjected to isolation as a child being placed into
freezers, closets, dark rooms, boxes and isolation tanks. Sensory
deprivation is a serious thing, that has been discovered to cause people
to hallucinate. The brain goes into an altered state just from sensory
deprivation. Polar explorers who see only white for days on end must
deal with this danger.
HANDWRITING MODIFICATION
Psychology developed over the years a number
of projective, objective and subjective tests of personality. Ludwig
Klages (of Germany), H.J. Eysenck (of England), and M.N. Bunker (of the
U.S.) are some of the notable researchers who took handwriting analysis
out of the occult realm and into the scientific realm. (The co-author,
Fritz, happens to be a certified Graphoanalyst through IGAS, who has
done Graphoanalysis professionally. IGAS has strict standards not to
allow members to do ahything associated with the occult, but insists
they keep their work on a scientific basis.) When a person writes, he
will use about 200 separate muscles in the hand, arm, and body. The mind
coordinates all these muscle movements. A good handwriting analyst has
about 800 different things that he can look for in a sample of
handwriting, such as how hard did the writer write with his instrument,
how big, where did he start on the paper, how did he cross his t etc.
In other words, the mind in order to write had to make hundreds of
decisions within seconds.
There are too many decisions to make them all
the decisions consciously. This is why document examiners can
authenticate signatures. Most of the many decisions as one writes are
done subconsciously, and the decisions are influenced by state of mind,
personality, the state of the physical body, and the environment. The goodhandwriting analyst is able to work backwards. Why was the decision
made to make the capital P look like an L? Why did the person start
their writing half-way into the paper and waste half the piece of paper?
Through scientific studies and observations, a vast wealth of
understanding has developed by graphologists about why certain decisions
are made. Some graphologists use a holistic method, others like
graphoanalysts, analyze each stroke.
Both methods will give the same
results if the handwriting analyst is skilled at applying the principles
of graphology. Handwriting analysis has not gotten the credibility it
deserves, in part, because it is such a powerful diagnostic tool, the
intelligence agencies have wanted to keep it to themselves. However, the
nation of Israel, uses handwriting analysis to hire with, and a high
percentage of the businesses use it in hiring also. The nation of Israel
has had a high rate of success with handwriting analysis. How does
handwriting analysis play a part in the mind control? Several ways.
A
number of the programmers are skilled in handwriting analysis. They are
well aware that the abuse of their slaves will show in the handwriting.
Through behavior modification (usually torture) the front alters are
trained to write in a fashion that hides the abuse. The abuse will show
in the handwriting of most of the alters, so many of them are programmed
not to read or write. This is why some of the child alters will have
older alters write for them.
The programmers were also aware of how the
mind heals/changes itself via handwriting therapy. If the mind will
place enough energy into writing a particular way--it will go ahead and
put enough energy into becoming what it writes. In other words, if I am
lazy, but I get determined enough to focus the brain so that it doesnt
make handwriting strokes that indicate laziness, then my brain will also
change its lazy attitude in other ways. In other words, I can begin to
change a personality trait by working on the handwriting decisions that
stem from that trait.
The programmers can and do help modify their
slaves personalities this way. They of course will employ a number of
personality changing techniques as a group package. The goal is to bring
as much pressure to bear as possible to get the original trait modified.
This will be done in accordance with the programming goals for the
various alters within a system. Remember, some alters need to be
outgoing and other reticent, some melancholic, and others sanguine or
choleric. The programmers know what they want and how to modify what
they have to get the temperament and personality traits they want.
BEHAVIOR MOD (MODIFICATION)
Behavior modification comes in various
packages. One package has been called ELT (Electrolytic Trtmt) developed
by H.C. Tien. One simple version of behavior mod is to find out what
someone has done which is good, and praise and reinforce that behavior.
Then state the goal. And then continue to reinforce promptly the good
things the person is doing. The goal in mind must be measurable. An
example of this, might be for a handler to praise his kitten and to
purchase it nice things if a client is satisfied with the sexual service
he got. The reinforcement needs to be soon, and appropriate. Thinking
behavior is a term that behavior mod scientists use. Adverse
conditioning is another. Anectine, which paralyzes the body and makes
one think they are suffocating, can be used for aversion conditioning.
The victim is told not to do a particular behavior or else experience
discomfort. When behavior modification is done in programming, you can
be sure that there is paper work done to chart the progress. Rather than
worry about what a person is thinking, the behaviorist charts a persons
behavior and then gives reinforcements of correct behavior (or the
opposite adverse rewards of punishment) to modify it. Victims are
conditioned to carry out certain behaviors. If an alter does something
wrong, there is an immediate consequence set up for it. Soon it is
conditioned not to do what the programmer doesnt want. The behavior mod
scientists believe that creativity can be controllable. When a child
creates a new form he is rewarded. Soon the child learns to create.
Illuminati Delta-Beta alters will be trained in espionage. They will be
trained to recognize a persons physical identity instantly. One method
of training which has been used is to teach people to remember
reflexively rather than analytically. Thousands of faces or thousands of
license plates, or whatever are flashed on a screen, and when a repeat
is shown the person must press a button. If a mistake is made, the slave
is treated to a nasty little shock. After a while a person develops the
correct reflexes. Slaves are being trained in recognition from the time
they are small children, this is important so that they can build their
internal worlds with mirror images and other confusing things. The
following deeper programming is an example of classical conditioning.
The childs hand is cut so that the child goes into a trance of shock,
and then each time they use the word deeper they cut deeper to enhance
the shock/trance state. By pairing the word with this trauma, when they
are through, the word deeper- asleep will throw some alters instantly
into a very deep trance.
PSYCHOLOGICAL MOTIVATION
When a person has been knocked down and
degraded, traumatized by poor sleep and little food and water, he is
more susceptible to suggestion. He can then be told that he himself is
the cause for his own degradation. If he just behaves betters, his
treatment will improve. When the person accepts his guilt for the bad
situation he is in, then the programmers give a target for the
blame--God, country, or whatever the person had depended upon. The
programmer then aggravates these hostile feelings, and keeps nurturing
them until the person is livid with anger toward the object of blame.
The victim is coached to project their blame onto this target of blame.
When this is accepted, the conditions for the victim improve. Once the
person has targeted their blame, then the Programmer becomes the friend
to help one fight the evil target. Anything and everything is
rationalized in this All becomes fair in war. Enemies are easy to
create. People readily accept them. The intelligence community has long
played on peoples fears about communism. People might be shocked to
realize that this was one of Hitlers favorite methods to recruit
loyalty from people. It is why the Nazis secretly burned down the
Reichstag, and then blamed the communists. The Illuminati are masters at
making Christianity the fault for everything from homosexual suicide to
the world wars.
NEURO-LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING
NLP means Neuro-Linguistic Programming,
which are practical communication skills. Programmers were using NLP
before it became known as NLP in 1976. Some NLP techniques are obvious
truths, and some are more subtle truths in dealing with human nature.
NLP can be more of an art, than a science. One of the truths in NLP is
Everyone lives in their unique reality built from their sense
impressions and individual experiences of life, and we act on the basis
of what we perceive our model of the world. (OConnor, Joseph & John
Seymour. Introducing NLP. San Francisco, CA: Aquarian Press,
1993, p.4.) That is why alters have their worlds created by
their programmers, and then the occult alters are indoctrinated with
satanic beliefs. ( Chap. 11 Part A deals with this indoctrination.)
Lets list some other assumptions that NLP practitioners believe in
without explaining them:
-
Almost all communication is non-verbal.
-
Knowledge of content is not required to make behavioral changes.
-
Our internal representation of the world is not the world but only our
own feeble map of it. The map is not the territory.
-
People will choose predicates which correspond to what representational
system they are using, and which one they choose can be seen from eye
accessing cues.
If one studies NLP, one will find that NLP
books such as Basic Techniques Book II by Clifford Wright, teach
people how to create dissociative states which are alternate
personalities, and that they teach people how to develop different
states of mind, and pseudo multiple personalities. It is difficult to
express all the different cross-overs that NLP has with Monarch
Programming, but at different times the concepts of NLP certainly would
be helpful to the handlers. However, it must be stressed that NLP IS NOT
Monarch Programming. One of NLPs suggestions is that a person assess
their present state and their desired state. This simply common
sense suggestion is often carried out during programming.
The Programmer
will tell the victim WHAT KIND of alters they want produced and HOW MANY
when they begin the torture. The motivation to do this is also suggested
by NLP and is accomplished by the programmers threats to the persons
life, and by the persons desire to be free of pain and torture. Milton
Ericksons work on altered states has been picked up by NLP. Likewise at
least part of the programming hypnosis is based on Ericksons ideas.
CLUES FOR OBSERVING A VICTIM
Lateral Eye Movement (LEM) can be a useful
skill to the programmer. Monarch victims are sometimes programmed so
that the real LEM is not done publicly by the victim, to prevent people
from getting visual clues as to what is going on in their mind. A person
who is thinking in visual images will generally speak more quickly and
at a higher pitch than someone who is not. These types of clues help the
Programmers be more skilled, but it isnt a necessity.
ANCHORS
NLP researchers have noticed that people
have emotional states in which the entire body will take up a posture in
carrying it out. Memories can come into a person that causes the body to
take up the negative states again. The NLP practitioners have developed
language which includes such terms as Anchors, emotional states, and
triggers. These words are used to describe ideas that have long been in
use.
For instance, lets say that when you heard
a particular song at some point in your life you were having a good time
(emotional state). Now that every time you receive a trigger to that
memory, such as the song, you regain that good feeling that is attached
to the memory of the song. Every time you hear the song, you feel good,
which then in turn, continues to act as reinforcement of the association
of a good feeling to the song. A stimulus that is linked to and triggers
a physiological state or emotional state is called an anchor. Our lives
are filled with naturally occurring anchors, such as our favorite
childhood smells, or the alarm clock.
One of the Illuminati kingpins in
Germany, a
Krupp, liked the smell of manure, and built his house so he
could smell horse manure all day. NLP is the art of building
associations with an anchor. A past emotion can be linked to something
today. If a person is afraid of public speaking, then a good feeling can
be linked to giving talks. The skilled programmer will anchor an emotion
with several sense cues--including auditory, visual, and touch. The
person visualizes an emotional state from the past. When the state is
reaching its peak, the anchor is placed in. The anchor needs to be
unique, distinctive, & easy to repeat in the exact form that it was
done.
Much of the trauma-based programming is actually setting anchors
using extreme trauma. When the anchors are tested (fired), if the
emotional state is pulled up, then the anchors have worked. Firing two
separate anchors at once is called collapsing anchors. Two separate
states can be fired at once. There is a methodology for collapsing
anchors together.
FUTURE PACING
Future pacing can be used to help program a
person toward his occupational objective which was charted for the
victim when they were small. Future pacing is a mental rehearsal that is
practiced in the imagination so that the person can deal with some
future challenge. Expectations can often become self-fulfilling
prophecies. NLP also is used to teach people how to learn. It teaches
people to learn a variety of methods for a single skill. However, this
type of self-help info is not freely given to the slave. It might be
used if the programmers needed to develop the person hypnotically in a
certain direction.
PACING FOR HYPNOSIS
Because Milton Erickson stands out as a
genius among those who have used hypnosis, and people are still trying
to figure out fully what he did, it is appropriate to mention his work.
We dont know how these ideas of Milton Ericksons are used by the
Programmers. We do know that the CIA has. paid close attention to his
ideas, and that some of the Programmers have some of the smoothest
tongues. If there is some way to utilize Ericksons work to help control
Mind-controlled slaves, then the Intelligence agencies have no doubt
found it. On the flip side, several dc-programmers used Ericksonian
methods to unlock the programming of the people they want to help. What
we describe in this section is just a small sampling of Ericksons
methods.
Another type of NLP pacing besides the one just previously
mentioned was developed by Milton Erickson. He would gain rapport with
anyone by describing to them what they were feeling, hearing and seeing.
He would induce a peaceful state by speaking slowly, using a soft
tonality, and pacing his speech to the persons breath. Gradually
hypnotic suggestions are introduced to lead them into what is called
downtime. He would gently encourage people with gentle suggestions
such as, Its easy to close your eyes whenever you wish to feel more
comfortable... But you may wonder how can anyone know what someone else
is thinking? Erickson developed language that was vague enough for
people to match their own thinking to what he described. He would use
smooth transitional words such as while, and, and as. The type of
vague sentences he would say are It is well known that people can read
books and make changes.
Milton Erickson learned to distract the
dominant brain hemisphere, and also speak in a complex way that all
seven (plus or minus two) parts of the conscious mind would get engaged
in trying to figure out what his ambiguous statements meant. Milton
found that he could say anything if he set it up in the context of
someone else saying it. He also found that the unconscious mind does not
process the linguistic negative. Rather than tell a child Dont fall
tell it Be careful.
REFRAMING WITH METAPHORS
Metaphors, some from Druidism or from some
other occult teachings, are used by the Programmers. For instance, the
seasonal changes that leaves on trees make is an example of a
programming metaphor.
For those readers who dont know what
refraining is, the following in the book Refraining, Neuro-Linguistic
Programming and the Transformation of Meaning by Bandler and
Grinder
(Moab, UT: Real People Press, 1982) is an excellent story to explain it:
A very old Chinese Taoist story describes a
farmer in a poor country village. He was considered very well-to-do,
because he owned a horse which he used for plowing and for
transportation. One day his horse ran away. All his neighbors exclaimed
how terrible this was, but the farmer simply said Maybe.
A few days
later the horse returned and brought two wild horses with it. The
neighbors all rejoiced at his good fortune, but the farmer just said
Maybe.
The next day the farmers son tried to ride one of the wild
horses; the horse threw him and broke the leg. The neighbors all offered
their sympathy for his misfortune, but the farmer again said Maybe.
The next week the conscription officers came to the village to take
young men for the army. They rejected the farmers son because of his
broken leg. When the neighbors told him how lucky he was, the farmer
replied, Maybe.
The meaning of an event depends upon the
FRAME we place upon it. Those frames are perceptions. Occult fairy tales
are great for refraining events. A frog turns into a prince. Rudolf's
embarrassing red nose becomes a guiding light to bring happiness to
people. Many of the common things in our everyday life are refrained by
the Programmers to have hidden mind-control meanings.
The Teddy Bear the
child is given by her Daddy is to remind her how helpless she is to
prevent him from raping her. The carousel toy is to remind the child of
dissociation and the internal carousel built into the mind.
Many of the
things that parents, who are intentionally raising a programmed child,
do, look nice on the outside unless one can reframe what they are doing
in the context of total-mind-control based on trauma and fear.
Refraining can be done by collapsing anchors. For instance, the sober
part of an alcoholic and the drunk state of the alcoholic are given the
same anchor and then these are collapsed together to get the drunk to
stay sober. The two states are taken in a process of integration for the
refraining to occur.
Refraining someone with MPD is almost impossible
without integration, but refraining a particular alter with metaphors is
not out of reach. The programmers have much more chance to reframe while
they program than the therapist, because the programmers set in
defensive programs to prevent others from reframing.
POWER WORDS, REVERSALS, & PUNS
In NLP, 7 senses are taken into
consideration. First we see, then we hear, and finally we have the
senses of internal kinetics and our emotions. The Programmer also takes
into consideration what are called power words. Those are words which
have specific meaning for the person. The programmers also love to use
reversals and puns, for instance in
Disneys Ducktales the character
says, I stole em fair and square. Other typical reversals are Life
is death, and death is life, Pain is love, and love is pain. Another
example is one used on
Cathy OBrien, where the words Service Entrance
were used to mean Serve us. En-Trance. Naming an alter Allison
Wonderland --a pun on Alice in Wonderland--is another example of a
programming pun. The programmers love to use these types of things.
THE MINDS NATURAL ALARM CLOCK
The programmers have made use of the minds
natural ability to wake itself up like an alarm clock if it wants.
Slaves may be given the coded message that the draconian enforcer will
come by to pick them up at 1 a.m. The slave will automatically wake up
in the middle of the night, and in a trance like a sleep walking, a deep
LGP alter will take the slave out to the street to be picked up. Many
slaves are being used at night without their families suspecting
anything. Sleeping patterns are also related to personality. REM sleep
is believed to help restore the effectiveness of certain brain pathways
in which norepinephrine is a transmitter substance. By programming
different alters to have certain sleep patterns, their personalities can
be adjusted. Of course this is done in conjunction with many other
aspects of mind control.
The RIGHT BRAIN & the UNCONSCIOUS
The Programmers are also aware that
right-handed people use their left brain hemisphere for highly conscious
processes which require good attention, focus & intentional decisions;
while their right brain will tend to work on the unconscious & automatic
chores. Split brain programming takes this contrast into account.
