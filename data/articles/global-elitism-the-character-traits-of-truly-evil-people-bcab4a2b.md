The first dangerous mistake the average person makes is the assumption that
evil is a kind of subjective or gray concept.
We would love to believe that all destructive
and malicious behavior is merely a product of bad environment, bad
upbringing, or mental psychosis. Deviance in the name of misguided profit
or status is often more acceptable to the public; as long as there is a
reason we can easily understand and grasp.
What frightens the average American today is not
the abhorrent action of criminality; rather, it is criminality without
easily definable reason.
What frightens the common citizen is the
possibility that some people hurt others not because mommy and daddy
mistreated them, or because they have a psychological deficiency that
clouds their judgment, but because they fully and consciously ENJOY doing
what they do.
Our society is desperate to make excuses for the
monsters of our era, perhaps because we would rather not entertain the
possibility that there is a dark side to humanity as a whole, that if left
unchecked, could take control in a deliberate and calculated way.
This is why the greatest crimes of our time often go ignored by the public.
The idea, for instance, that international financiers and political elites
would purposely create economic disparity, social chaos, and global war out
of a desire for centralized power and a disturbed sense of superiority is
simply too much for many to handle.
Surely, these terrible events throughout our
modern history are merely the result of random coincidence and human error
right?
Unfortunately, this is not the case. In fact, the majority of catastrophic
cultural policies and tragedies can be traced directly back to a particular
subset of people, who use their positions of influence for ill purpose, and
knowingly engineer calamity not just for personal gain, but the gain of
their social class.
In the Liberty Movement, we often refer to this group as Globalists or
Elitists.
They permeate the upper echelons of our nation,
and they do indeed have a culture that is entirely separate and disparate
from our own. If one studies their literature, their initiatives, and their
motives, he would discover another world, driven by outlandish goals and an
even more outlandish brand of religious fervor.
Here are some of the character traits and
beliefs that make these people easy to identify
Xeno-Fascism
Global Elitists tend to see themselves as a separate breed of
human being; a superior class with superior faculties, and thus, born to
rule over the rest of us. In their writings they often espouse the
teachings of Platos Republic, and the
concept of the Philosopher Kings.
They believe that some men and women are endowed
with a genetic predisposition to leadership, and that the average person
does not have the intelligence to determine his own destiny. They see the
rest of humanity as a blank canvas, and themselves as the artists. We are to
be molded and our social dichotomies are to be manipulated.
In reality, they are no smarter than the rest of us.
Rather, they inherent positions of wealth and
influence, and automatically assume this makes them superior.
Their ability to mold society is derived
entirely from their extensive capital and their complete lack of morality.
If they were not in the top .1% of the worlds rich, they would be treated
like common criminals for their behavior, but sadly, in our day and age
money often buys undue respect.
Imagine a private club of John Wayne Gacys or
Charles Mansons, except with 80% of the worlds wealth at their disposal and
the means to purchase good publicity and legal immunity.
That is essentially what we are dealing with
"Gradually, by selective breeding, the
congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they
become almost different species. A revolt of the plebs would become as
unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice
of eating mutton."
- Bertrand Russell
The Impact of Science on Society (1953)
pgs. 49-50
"Speaking of a future at most only decades away, an experimenter in
intelligence control asserted, 'I foresee a time when we shall have the
means and therefore, inevitably, the temptation to manipulate the
behavior and intellectual functioning of all the people through
environmental and biochemical manipulation of the brain.'"

Pursuit of Zero
Conscience
Elitists believe that
conscience is a hindrance to
success, instead of a worthwhile virtue.
They knowingly and deliberately abandon their
moral compass because they see it as an unnatural restriction, an obstacle
that makes getting what they want more difficult. Conscience, however, never
quite disappears in anyone.
In order to reconcile their wretched mindset
with that distant nagging sensation of guilt, they claim that their actions
are,
for the greater good of the greater
number.
They desperately want to believe that they are
serving the future of mankind, and that we should appreciate their guiding
hand, even though the things they do seem far more hateful than helpful.
They would condescend to call this tough love.
They further attempt to avoid the fact of their own dysfunction by trying to
elicit criminality in others. If they can convince the masses that morality
is relative and that right and wrong are subject to interpretation, if
they can convince us to ignore our own inner voices which are inborn, then
their monstrosity could eventually be considered normal, even preferable.
For in a world of moral relativists, the man
with a conscience becomes the criminal, the outcast, and the elites become
the heroes they always wanted to believe themselves to be.
In the meantime, they will often resort to costume and theater, wrapping
themselves in a particular belief system and playing the role of the
saint.
The mask rarely comes off until they think their
position of power is assured.
"I am now as before a Catholic and will
always remain so."
- Adolf Hitler
Do you really believe the masses will be Christian again? Nonsense!
Never again. That tale is finished. No one will listen to it again. But
we can hasten matters. The parsons will dig their own graves. They will
betray their God to us. They will betray anything for the sake of
their miserable jobs and incomes
- Adolf Hitler
The tenth rule of the ethics of rules and means is that you do what you
can with what you have and clothe it in moral arguments
the essence of
Lenins speeches during this period was,
'They have the guns and therefore we are
for peace and for reformation through the ballot. When we have the
guns then it will be through the bullet.'
And it was.
- Saul Alinsky
(Barack
Obama taught the amoral philosophies of Alinsky as an
organizer in Chicago.
Hillary Clinton made Alinsky the topic
of her undergraduate thesis)
Promote Collectivism
Top globalists are not necessarily collectivists themselves.
In fact, they often swing far to the other end
of the spectrum into an aberrant form of individualism. As discussed above,
they even see conscience as a restriction on their personal freedom, and
rebel against it as if rebelling against enslavement.
What they do not grasp is that the inherent
nature of conscience is a gift, one which has so far kept humanity away from
the brink of total self-destruction, at least to this point. It is not a
prison. Rather, it is protection from ourselves.
The elitists insane ideal of pure individualism without self discipline
is a private matter they rarely discuss. In public, they constantly promote
the collectivist lifestyle and admonish individualism in common people as
selfish or narcissistic.
People often confuse collectivism with community.
This is caused by a lack of understanding as
well as a lack of experience.
-
Community is a voluntary gathering of
individuals for the purpose of mutual aid.
-
Collectivism
is the gathering of people by threat of force or loss, for
the purpose of consolidating power into the hands of a few. It is
the act of destroying individualism in the name of protecting the
group.
In America today, we have a disappearing sense
of real community, while the advantages of collectivism are being sung to
the rooftops by global elites.
If the population can be convinced that they are devoid of inherent
qualities and characteristics, and that their environment is the totality of
their existence, then they will hand over all power to anyone who promises
them the best possible surroundings.
That is to say, when we have no faith in our own
individualism and self-responsibility, we will automatically seek
protection, usually from a nanny government or dictatorship.
This process of wrenching self determination
from the populace has an ultimate end goal:
World Governance and
total dominance.
The powers of financial capitalism had
another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of
financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system
of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.
This system was to be controlled in a
feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert,
by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences.
The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements
in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the
world's central banks which were themselves private corporations.
Each central bank... sought to dominate its
government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate
foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the
country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic
rewards in the business world.
- Carroll Quigley
CFR member, mentor to Bill Clinton, from 'Tragedy
And Hope'
"In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states
will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn't
such a great idea after all."
- Strobe Talbot
President Clinton's Deputy Secretary of
State, as quoted in Time, July 20th, 1992.
The "Noble Lie"
Elitists are very adamant about the idea of the noble lie; the use of a
lie to attain a positive goal.
In their view, average citizens lack the
capacity to understand the bigger political and social picture, and so, we
must be lied to in order to make us do what is best for ourselves. Of
course, their version of what is best for our culture always seems to
include first and foremost what is best for them.
The noble lie is a logical fallacy of epic proportions, and I often wonder
if global elitists secretly doubt its legitimacy, or if they really buy into
their own tripe. If you need to lie to people in order to get them to accept
your ideas, then there must be something terribly wrong with your ideas.
Ideas with vitality and honesty do not need to
be sold to the public through chicanery; the truth takes on a life of its
own.
Only destructive philosophies need a foundation
of lies in order to take root.
"We are at present working discreetly with
all our might to wrest this mysterious force called sovereignty out of
the clutches of the local nation states of the world. All the time we
are denying with our lips what we are doing with our hands."
- Professor Arnold Toynbee
in a June 1931 speech before the
Institute for the Study of International Affairs in Copenhagen.
"Our job is to give people not what they want, but what we decide they
ought to have."
- Richard Salent
former president, CBS News, Bill Clinton:
Friend or Foe
Population Reduction
One of the centerpieces of the globalist religion is the concept of
population reduction.
They not only see themselves as a separate
species with superior genetic makeup and a propensity for rulership, they
also see the rest of us as cockroaches and useless eaters; a herd that
needs to be culled. The funny thing about population reductionists is that
they always want OTHER people to die in order to save the planet.
They never offer their own lives as a sacrifice
for the greater good. This is because they assume they are too important
(ostensibly because they think they are intelligent), while many of us are
expendable.
Of course, overpopulation today is an oversold myth that has been debunked
in many scientific circles. Population expansion is also not necessarily a
bad thing. Greater population means more minds working on more problems. It
drives technological advancement and forces us through the survival
imperative to invent more efficient methods of production.
There are indeed advantages to growth.
In the end, though, global elites do not care about the Earth. They do not
believe in population reduction because they want to reduce pollution, our
so-called carbon footprint, save the poor endangered animals, or even to
protect finite resources.
They want population reduction because first,
they are
Eugenicists who see some people as
genetically inferior to others, and second, because a culled population is
easier to dominate.
Again, less minds working means less problems
solved, and less individuals to rock the boat when the state abuses its
power.
"A total world population of 250-300 million
people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal."
- Audubon magazine, interview with
Ted Turner, 1996
"A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child,
despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than
vasectomy, might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men...
The development of a long-term sterilizing
capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when
pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive
fertility control.
The capsule could be implanted at puberty
and might be removable, with official permission, for a limited number
of births."
- John P. Holdren
(Top Science Adviser To Barack Obama)
"Out of the full spectrum of human personality, one-fourth is electing
to transcend
One-fourth is ready to so choose, given the example of one
other
One-fourth is resistant to election.
They are unattracted by life ever-evolving.
One-fourth is destructive. They are born angry with God
They are
defective seeds
There have always been defective seeds.
In the past they were permitted to die a
natural death
We, the elders, have been patiently waiting until the
very last moment before the quantum transformation, to take action to
cut out this corrupted and corrupting element in the body of humanity.
It is like watching a cancer grow
Now, as we approach the quantum shift from
creature-human to co-creative human - the human who is an inheritor of
god-like powers - the destructive one-fourth must be eliminated from the
social body. We have no choice, dearly beloveds.
Fortunately you, dearly beloveds, are not
responsible for this act. We are. We are in charge of Gods
selection process for planet Earth. He selects, we destroy. We are the
riders of the pale horse, Death. We come to bring death to those who are
unable to know God
The riders of the pale horse are about to
pass among you.
Grim reapers, they will separate the wheat
from the chaff.
This is the most painful period in the
history of humanity
"
- Futurist Barbara Marx Hubbard
(featured in the film THRIVE,
a collectivist propaganda piece falsely presented as an attack on the
elitist establishment
in other words, controlled opposition)
The Source Of Our Pain
Now, globalists are not the only source of our social pain.
We bear some responsibility. When we are not
vigilant, when we deny our own ignorance and refuse to learn, when we lie to
ourselves, when we cater to personal superficial desires rather than taking
the future into account, we open the door for the devil, as it were.
Evil, like conscience, resides in us all.
That said, globalists are not just terrible people in a random sense. They
have constructed an entire culture of deviance. They are organized evil, and
this is a problem that we must deal with soon.
Good men are defined not only by their adherence
to the inner voice of truth, but also their willingness to act when the
truth is threatened.
We must educate others, and when the time comes,
put ourselves in harms way to remove the globalist ilk, before they destroy
everything in a raging elitist fervor
