Global Wealth Transfer Schemes Intentionally Widening the Income Gap
The gap between the rich and poor (watch below video) has become so extreme in the US, and all over the world as well, that it causing severe (and preventable) suffering, disease and even death.
The One Percent
If you think of society as divided into 3 classes (the upper, middle and lower classes), you can see in the video above how the wealth is being shifted to the upper class, and more specifically the super rich 1%, while at the same time many in the lower class are falling below the poverty line. The poverty line is now advancing to those in the middle class, which means being in the middle class is becoming less meaningful:
with the way things are going, even middle class people may still end up being in survival mode and living day-to-day or month-to-month.
Gandhi said,
"Poverty is the worst form of violence".
The manipulation of wealth is a form of violence been directed towards the mass population.
The gap between rich and poor
is becoming ever wider,
not by chance, but by design.
International banksters have long
manipulated booms and busts
as a sneaky way of transferring
mass wealth to the upper class.
Shocking Statistics of Wealth Inequality and Gap Between Rich and Poor This video is based on a Harvard study which reported that in 2012 for the US that:
The top 1% of people own 40% of the wealth The bottom 80% of people own 7% of the wealth The top 1% take home 24% of the national annual income (up from 9% in 1976) The top 1% own 50% of stocks, bonds and mutual funds, while the bottom 50% own 0.5%
The top 1% of people own 40% of the wealth
The bottom 80% of people own 7% of the wealth
The top 1% take home 24% of the national annual income (up from 9% in 1976)
The top 1% own 50% of stocks, bonds and mutual funds, while the bottom 50% own 0.5%
Creating Crashes to Transfer Wealth It is important to remember this sort of wealth inequality and gap between rich and poor has not come about by chance. It is by design.
We don't live in a free economy or a free market. We live in a manipulated market which is thinly disguised as a free economy. Behind the scenes the money masters - the international banking families such as the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Morgans, etc. - own the central banks in almost every country (the Federal Reserve in the US), and thus are able to set national interest rates. This is essentially identical to the power to determine the exact amount of money in circulation, because they control the borrowing rate.
They inflate and deflate to create booms, bubbles and busts. The housing crisis which resulted in millions of foreclosures, evictions and new homeless was the latest in a long list of crashes these banksters have orchestrated - to transfer even more money to the wealthy and widen the gap between rich and poor even further.
The New World Order Agenda of a Two-Tier Society: Rulers and Slaves This is all in line with the New World Order agenda to create a strictly hierarchical and two-tier society comprised of just rulers and slaves. Their scheme is to keep tightening the screws and transferring wealth until it reaches a certain point, where the middle class will be disintegrated or become so meaningless that only two classes will exist in practice. This is all being manipulated! It's time to wake up, band together and spread the word while we can. There is a small window of time to stop this disturbing trend. If we do nothing, more and more of us will sink into poverty and survival mode and only have the energy to keep afloat (not change society). Now is the time to act by spreading the knowledge of how we are been manipulated, so we can reach a critical mass, and narrow the gap between rich and poor by taking back control of our currency and government.
