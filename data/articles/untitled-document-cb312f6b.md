I
profess my faith...of the Child Jesus.
I have a will but
I have not ??? the disposition of the precious metals (gold) which
I own and in which in some documents I was a fiduciary as evidenced
by the xerox copies of any gold deposits in the different depositories
and banks in the different countries of the world. Some of the original
documents were left behind in Malacanang Palace, Manila Philippines
last Feb 25, 1986. I have no way to get back my original documents
now. So that the Filipino people will be benefitted I now would like
that a foundation be established now so that it could function ???
and as seen my designated trustees will accept the Trust.
My trustee is the
Holy Roman Apostolic Catholic Church (Holy See) with its reigning
Pontiff. I am submitting the pertinant documents to the said trustee
and co trustee.
1. Execution &
implementation according to the several laws ??????
2. Authorization to withdraw the metals
3. Documents, certification of owbership both original and xerox copies
of which I, Ferdinand E. Marcos is the sole owner and signatory of
said deposits of gold.
