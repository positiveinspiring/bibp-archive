# The Open Source Revolution is Coming and It Will Conquer the 1% - Ex CIA 
Spy Says

Robert David Steele, former
Marine, CIA case officer, and U.S. co-founder of the U.S. Marine
Corps intelligence activity, is a man on a mission. But it's a
mission that frightens the U.S. intelligence establishment to its
core.
With 18 years experience working across the U.S. intelligence
community, followed by 20 more years in commercial intelligence
and training, Steele's exemplary career has spanned almost all
areas of both the clandestine world.
Steele started off as a Marine Corps
infantry and intelligence officer. After four years on active
duty, he joined the CIA for about a decade before co-founding
the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity, where he was deputy
director.
Widely recognized as the leader of
the Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) paradigm, Steele went on to
write the handbooks on OSINT for NATO, the U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency and the U.S. Special Operations Forces. In
passing, he personally trained 7,500 officers from over 66
countries.
In 1992, despite opposition from the
CIA, he obtained Marine Corps permission to organize a landmark
international conference on open source intelligence - the
paradigm of deriving information to support policy decisions not
through secret activities, but from open public sources
available to all.
The conference was such a success it brought
in over 620 attendees from the intelligence world.
But the CIA wasn't happy, and
ensured that Steele was prohibited from running a second
conference. The clash prompted him to resign from his position
as second-ranking civilian in Marine Corps intelligence, and
pursue the open source paradigm elsewhere.
He went on to found and head up the
Open Source Solutions Network Inc. and later the non-profit
Earth Intelligence Network which runs the
Public Intelligence
Blog.

David Steele speaking at
the
Inter-American Defense Board in 2013
I first came across Steele when I
discovered his Amazon review of my third book, The War on Truth:
9/11, Disinformation and the Anatomy of Terrorism.
A voracious reader, Steele is the
number 1 Amazon reviewer for non-fiction across 98 categories.
He also reviewed my latest book, A User's Guide to the Crisis of
Civilization, but told me I'd overlooked an important early work
-
'A More Secure World - Our Shared
Responsibility, Report of the UN High-Level Panel on Threats,
Challenges, and Change.'
Last month, Steele presented a
startling paper at the Libtech conference in New York,
sponsored by the
Internet Society and
Reclaim.
Drawing on principles set out in his
latest book,
The Open-Source Everything
Manifesto - Transparency, Truth and Trust, he told the
audience that all the major preconditions for revolution - set
out in his 1976 graduate thesis - were now present in the
United States and Britain.
Steele's book is a must-read, a
powerful yet still pragmatic roadmap to a new civilisational
paradigm that simultaneously offers a trenchant, unrelenting
critique of the prevailing global order. His interdisciplinary
'whole systems' approach dramatically connects up the increasing
corruption, inefficiency and unaccountability of the
intelligence system and its political and financial masters with
escalating inequalities and environmental crises.
But he also offers a comprehensive
vision of hope that activist networks like Reclaim are
implementing today.
"We are at the end of a
five-thousand-year-plus historical process during which
human society grew in scale while it abandoned the early
indigenous wisdom councils and communal decision-making," he
writes in The Open Source
Everything Manifesto.
"Power was centralized in the
hands of increasingly specialized 'elites' and 'experts' who
not only failed to achieve all they promised but used
secrecy and the control of information to deceive the public
into allowing them to retain power over community resources
that they ultimately looted."
Today's capitalism, he argues, is
inherently predatory and destructive:
"Over the course of the last
centuries, the commons was fenced, and everything from
agriculture to
water was commoditized without regard to the true cost
in non-renewable resources. Human beings, who had spent
centuries evolving away from slavery, were re-commoditized
by the Industrial Era."
Open source everything, in this
context, offers us the chance to build on what we've learned
through industrialization, to learn from our mistakes, and
catalyze the re-opening of the commons, in the process breaking
the grip of defunct power structures and enabling the
possibility of prosperity for all.
"Sharing, not secrecy, is the
means by which we realize such a lofty destiny as well as
create infinite wealth.
The wealth of networks, the
wealth of knowledge, revolutionary wealth - all can create a
nonzero win-win Earth that works for one hundred percent of
humanity. This is the 'utopia' that Buckminster Fuller
foresaw, now within our reach."
The goal, he concludes, is to
reject:
"... concentrated illicitly
aggregated and largely phantom wealth in favor of community
wealth defined by community knowledge, community sharing of
information, and community definition of truth derived in
transparency and authenticity, the latter being the ultimate
arbiter of shared wealth."
Despite this unabashedly radical
vision, Steele is hugely respected by senior military
intelligence experts across the world.
As a researcher at the U.S. Army War
College's Strategic Studies Institute, he has authored several
monographs advocating the need for open source methods to
transform the craft of intelligence.
He has lectured to the U.S. State
Department and Department of Homeland Security as well as
National Security Councils in various countries, and his new
book has received accolades from senior intelligence officials
across multiple countries including France and Turkey.
Yet he remains an outspoken critic
of U.S. intelligence practices and what he sees as their integral
role in aggravating rather than ameliorating the world's
greatest threats and challenges.
This week, I had the good fortune of
being able to touch base with Steele to dig deeper into his
recent analysis of the future of U.S. politics in the context of
our accelerating environmental challenges.
The first thing I
asked him was where he sees things going over the next decade,
given his holistic take.
"Properly educated people always
appreciate holistic approaches to any challenge. This means that
they understand both cause and effect, and intertwined
complexities," he said.
"A major part of our problem in the
public policy arena is the decline in intelligence with
integrity among key politicians and staff at the same time that
think tanks and universities and non-governmental organizations
have also suffered a similar intellectual diminishment.
"My early graduate education was
in the 1970's when Limits to Growth and World
Federalism
were the rage. Both sought to achieve an over-view of
systemic challenges, but both also suffered from the myth of
top-down hubris.
What was clear in the 1970s,
that has been obscured by political and financial treason in
the past half-century, is that everything is connected -
what we do in the way of paving over wetlands, or in
poisoning ground water 'inadvertently' because of our
reliance on pesticides and fertilizers that are not subject
to the integrity of the 'Precautionary Principle,'
ultimately leads to climate catastrophes that are acts of
man, not acts of god."
He points me to his
tremendous collection of reviews of books on
climate change, disease, environmental degradation,
peak oil, and water scarcity.
"I see five major overlapping
threats on the immediate horizon," he continues.
"They are all related:
-
the
collapse of complex societies
-
the acceleration of the
Earth's demise with changes that used to take 10,000 years
now taking three or less
-
predatory or shock capitalism
-
financial crime out of the City of London and Wall Street
-
political corruption at scale, to include the west
supporting 42 of 44 dictators
We are close to multiple mass
catastrophes."
What about the claim that
the U.S. is
on the brink of revolution?
"Revolution is overthrow - the
complete reversal of the status quo ante.
We are at the end of centuries
of what Lionel Tiger calls 'The Manufacture of Evil,' in
which merchant banks led by the City of London have
conspired with captive governments to concentrate wealth and
commoditize everything including humans.
What revolution
means in practical terms is that balance has been lost and
the status quo ante is unsustainable.
There are two 'stops' on greed
to the nth degree:
We are now at a
point where both stops are activating."
Former CIA officer's matrix
on
the preconditions for revolution
It's not just the U.S., he adds.
"The preconditions of revolution
exist in the UK, and most western countries.
The number of active
pre-conditions is quite stunning, from elite isolation to
concentrated wealth to inadequate socialization and
education, to concentrated land holdings to loss of
authority to repression of new technologies especially in
relation to
energy, to the atrophy of the public sector and spread
of corruption, to media dishonesty, to mass unemployment of
young men and on and on and on."
So why isn't it happening yet?
"Preconditions are not the same
as precipitants. We are waiting for our Tunisian fruit
seller.
The public will endure great
repression, especially when most media outlets and schools
are actively aiding the repressive meme of 'you are
helpless, this is the order of things.'
When we have a scandal so
powerful that it cannot be ignored by the average Briton or
American, we will have a revolution that overturns the
corrupt political systems in both countries, and perhaps
puts many banks out of business.
Vaclav Havel calls this 'The
Power of the Powerless.' One spark, one massive fire."
But we need more than revolution, in
the sense of overthrow, to effect change, surely.
How does your
manifesto for 'open source everything' fit into this?
"The west has pursued an
industrialization path that allows for the privatization of
wealth from the commons, along with the criminalization of
commons rights of the public, as well as the externalization
of all true costs.
Never mind that fracking
produces earthquakes and poisons aquifers - corrupt
politicians at local, state or province, and national levels
are all too happy to take money for looking the other way.
Our entire commercial,
diplomatic, and informational systems are now cancerous.
When trade treaties have secret sections - or are entirely
secret - one can be certain the public is being screwed and
the secrecy is an attempt to avoid accountability. Secrecy
enables corruption.
So also does an inattentive
public enable corruption."
Is this a crisis of capitalism,
then? Does capitalism need to end for us to resolve these
problems? And if so, how?
"Predatory capitalism is based
on the privatization of profit and the externalization of
cost. It is an extension of the fencing of the commons, of
enclosures, along with the criminalization of prior common
customs and rights.
What we need is a system that
fully accounts for all costs. Whether we call that
capitalism or not is irrelevant to me. But doing so would
fundamentally transform the dynamic of present day
capitalism, by making capital open source.
For example, and as calculated
by
my colleague
J.Z. Liszkiewicz, a white cotton T-shirt
contains roughly 570 gallons of water, 11 to 29 gallons of
fuel, and a number of toxins and emissions including
pesticides, diesel exhaust, and heavy metals and other
volatile compounds - it also generally includes child labor.
Accounting for those costs and
their real social, human and environmental impacts has
totally different implications for how we should organize
production and consumption than current predatory
capitalism."
So what exactly do you mean by open
source everything?
"We have over 5 billion human
brains that are the one infinite resource available to us
going forward.
Crowd-sourcing and cognitive
surplus are two terms of art for the changing power dynamic
between those at the top that are ignorant and corrupt, and
those across the bottom that are attentive and ethical.
The open source ecology is made
up of a wide range of opens - open farm technology, open
source software, open hardware, open networks, open money,
open small business technology, open patents - to name just
a few.
The key point is that they must
all develop together, otherwise the existing system will
isolate them into ineffectiveness.
Open data is largely worthless
unless you have open hardware and open software. Open
government demands open cloud and open spectrum, or money
will dominate feeds and speeds."
Robert Steele's vision for open
source systems
On 1st May, Steele sent an open
letter to U.S. vice president
Joe Biden requesting him to consider
establishing an Open Source Agency that would transform the
operation of the intelligence community, dramatically reduce
costs, increasing oversight and accountability, while increasing
access to the best possible information to support holistic
policy-making.
To date, he has received no
response. I'm not particularly surprised. Open source everything
pretty much undermines everything the national security state
stands for.
Why bother even asking vice
president Biden to consider it?
"The national security state is
rooted in secrecy as a means of avoiding accountability.
My first book, On Intelligence:
Spies and Secrecy in an Open World - which by the way had a
foreword from Senator David Boren, the immediate past
chairman of the Senate Select Committee for Intelligence -
made it quite clear that the national security state is an
expensive, ineffective monstrosity that is simply not fit
for purpose. In that sense, the national security state is
it's own worst enemy - it's bound to fail."
Given his standing as an
intelligence expert, Steele's criticisms of U.S. intelligence
excesses are beyond scathing - they are damning.
"Most of what is produced
through secret methods is not actually intelligence at all.
It is simply secret information that is, most of the time,
rather generic and therefore not actually very useful for
making critical decisions at a government level.
The National Security Agency (NSA)
has not prevented any terrorist incidents.
CIA cannot even get the
population of Syria correct and provides no intelligence -
decision-support - to most cabinet secretaries, assistant
secretaries, and department heads.
Indeed General Tony Zinni, when
he was commander in chief of the U.S. Central Command as it
was at war, is on record as saying that he received, 'at
best,' a meager 4% of what he needed to know from secret
sources and methods."
So does open source mean you are
calling for abolition of intelligence agencies as we know them,
I ask.
"I'm a former spy and I believe
we still need spies and secrecy, but we need to redirect the
vast majority of the funds now spent on secrecy toward
savings and narrowly focused endeavors at home.
For instance, utterly ruthless
counterintelligence against corruption, or horrendous evils
like pedophilia.
"Believe it or not, 95% of what
we need for ethical evidence-based decision support cannot
be obtained through the secret methods of standard
intelligence practices. But it can be obtained quite openly
and cheaply from academics, civil society, commerce,
governments, law enforcement organizations, the media, all
militaries, and non-governmental organizations.
An Open Source Agency, as I've
proposed it, would not just meet 95% of our intelligence
requirements, it would do the same at all levels of
government and carry over by enriching education, commerce,
and research - it would create what I called in 1995 a
'Smart Nation.'
"The whole point of Open Source
Everything is to restore public agency.
Open Source is the only form of
information and information technology that is affordable to
the majority, interoperable across all boundaries, and
rapidly scalable from local to global without the curse of
overhead that proprietary corporations impose."
Robert Steele's graphic
on open
source systems thinking
It's clear to me that when Steele
talks about intelligence as 'decision-support,' he really does
intend that we grasp "all information in all languages all the
time" - that we do multidisciplinary research spanning centuries
into the past as well as into the future.
His most intriguing premise is that
the 1% are simply not as powerful as they, and we, assume them
to be.
"The collective buying power of
the five billion poor is four times that of the one billion
rich according to the late Harvard business thinker Prof.
C. K. Prahalad - open source everything is about the
five billion poor coming together to reclaim their
collective wealth and mobilize it to transform their lives.
There is zero chance of the
revolution being put down. Public agency is emergent, and
the ability of the public to literally put any bank or
corporation out of business overnight is looming. To
paraphrase Abe Lincoln, you cannot screw all of the people
all of the time.
We're there. All we lack is a
major precipitant - our Tunisian fruit seller.
When it happens the revolution
will be deep and lasting."
The Arab spring analogy has its
negatives. So far, there really isn't much to root for. I want
to know what's to stop this revolution from turning into a
violent, destructive mess.
Steele is characteristically
optimistic.
"I have struggled with this
question. What I see happening is an end to national
dictat and the emergence of bottom-up clarity,
diversity, integrity, and sustainability.
Individual towns across the USA
are now nullifying federal and state regulations - for
example gag laws on animal cruelty, blanket permissions for
fracking. Those such as my colleague Parag Khanna that speak
to a new era of city-states are correct in my view. Top down
power has failed in a most spectacular manner, and bottom-up
consensus power is emergent. 'Not in my neighborhood' is
beginning to trump 'Because I say so.'
The one unlimited resource we
have on the planet is the human brain - the current strategy
of 1% capitalism is failing because it is killing the Golden
Goose at multiple levels.
Unfortunately, the gap between
those with money and power and those who actually know what
they are talking about has grown catastrophic. The rich are
surrounded by sycophants and pretenders whose continued
employment demands that they not question the premises.
As Larry Summers lectured
Elizabeth Warren, 'insiders do not criticize insiders.'"
But how can activists actually start
moving toward the open source vision now?
"For starters, there are eight
'tribes' that among them can bring together all relevant
information: academia, civil society including labor unions
and religions, commerce especially small business,
government especially local, law enforcement, media,
military, and non-government/non-profit.
At every level from local to
global, across every mission area, we need to create
stewardship councils integrating personalities and
information from all eight tribes. We don't need to wait
around for someone else to get started.
All of us who recognize the
vitality of this possibility can begin creating these new
grassroots structures from the bottom-up, right now."
So how does open source everything
have the potential to 're-engineer the Earth'?
For me, this is
the most important question, and Steele's answer is inspiring.
"Open Source Everything
overturns top-down 'because I say so at the point of a gun'
power.
Open Source Everything makes
truth rather than violence the currency of power. Open
Source Everything demands that true cost economics and the
indigenous concept of 'seventh generation thinking' - how
will this affect society 200 years ahead - become central.
Most of our problems today can
be traced to the ascendance of unilateral militarism,
virtual colonialism, and predatory capitalism, all based on
force and lies and encroachment on the commons.
The national security state
works for the City of London and Wall Street - both are
about to be toppled by a combination of Eastern alternative
banking and alternative international development
capabilities, and individuals who recognize that they have
the power to pull their money out of the banks and not buy
the consumer goods that subsidize corruption and the
concentration of wealth.
The opportunity to take back the
commons for the benefit of humanity as a whole is open -
here and now."
For Steele, the open source
revolution is inevitable, simply because the demise of the
system presided over by the 1% cannot be stopped - and because
the alternatives to reclaiming the commons are too dismal to
contemplate.
We have no choice but to step up.
"My motto, a play on the CIA
motto that is disgraced every day, is 'the truth at any cost
lowers all other costs'", he tells me.
"Others wiser than I have
pointed out that nature bats last. We are at the end of an
era in which lies can be used to steal from the public and
the commons.
We are at the beginning of an
era in which truth in public service can restore us all to a
state of grace."
