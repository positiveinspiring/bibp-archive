# The Atlantean Conspiracy - 37

Schools, Courts,
Churches, and the Cult of Saturn
When you graduate from high school you come out processionally with a black
robe, which is black for Saffron, the God of the Hebrews, requiring that you
wear the square mortarboard on top of your head.
The square mortarboards
are, of course, used by the Freemasons for their plaster, so that is why you
wear a square mortarboard when you graduate, ultimately becoming an Alumni.
It all has to do with Freemasonry; it all has to do with the control of
education in this country.
Jordan Maxwell, Matrix of Power
First you pay
out your tuition to get into universeity where they strip you of your
Intuition and give you an Indoctrination.
Then you receive a MaStars
Masonic degree, while wearing a Masonic mortar board cap and Cult of
Saturn black robes
to become an Alumni/Illumini. Graduation means to increment or retard
progress.
As Jordan Maxwell says, the true meaning of Graduation is
gradual
indoctrination.
Indeed.
Stick a bunch of 5 year olds in a room full of 5year
olds for a year, then a bunch of 6year olds with 6year olds and so on for 20
years, until youre so indoctrinated they give you a doctorate
The syllables are Mafor measure and Storfor Star. measurer of the
stars, namely an astrologer. Children are still given a star today for
successful application to their studies. When we matriculate from a
university, we are given a Masters Degree.
This is purely sabean. Degrees
are part of the cycle of the zodiac. One was given a degree, to show that
they, like the sun
they were progeny of, had ascended to an exalted place. Once you had
mastered the stars you were then quite literally a MASTER.

Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology
Judges and Roman Catholic priests also traditionally wear/wore black robes.
Judges have a Masonic hammer or gavel which they hit to declare the word of
Law. The idea of law comes from the biblical ten stone commandments
and so it is said that you break the law. Judges always sit on a three
tier high platform representing the first three blue degrees of freemasonry.
The same
tritier platform is found at Congress, and the altar in most
Catholic and Protestant churches is three tiers high. Thats also why you
get/give someone the third degree related to the third degree of Masonry
where the initiate is asked a series of probing questions he
must answer correctly in order to become a Master Mason.
There is usually a
gate around church altars just as there are gates with swinging doors in
every courtroom. The congregations at church all stand up to recognize the
priest, just as all rise when the judge walks in.
Then the judge takes a
recess because he is in court playing a game of tennis (commandments),
with lawyers who play the dialectic protagonist/antagonist game, bouncing
the advantage into each others court. In the courtroom witnesses must place
their hand on the old/new testament before giving their testimony, just
as a priests sermon is often called testimony (also notice mon from
moon in testimony and sermon).
As a witness swears in, one hand is placed
on the bible while the other is held up; In church, when parishioners feel
the holy spirit, often during song, they will hold one or both hands up to
praise the lord.
Then when you get further into Saturn, you begin to understand that his
color is black, that he was a God of one of the many different Semitic
tribes, or groups, and one of his symbols was a square. Then you get into
the square black mortarboard that
the university or high school students wear when they graduate.
It is a
square on his head, and it is usually black. The color of Saturn, one of the
ancient Hebrew Gods. This is the same black used on the robe the judge wears
when he is going to throw you in jail. Because the black represents Saturn.
Saturn is the old Semitic God.
That is why churches and courtrooms look the
same today, because when you go into churches you sit out here with the poor
folks in the chairs out here in the pews, but
you cannot go up onto the lifted higher elevation, you can't go inside the
gate, you can't go inside the little doors, only the priest can go inside
there and officiate for you.
You stay on the outside with the poor folks.
The altar is always raised at least three tiers, because in Egypt that was
the way it was always done.
The altar was always raised so the people could
see the representative of God dressed in black. The priest comes out on the
altar dressed in black, and he is officiating for you, he is the mediator
between you and God. That is the same thing that happens in the courtroom,
you walk in and you are part of the poor folks sitting out here in the
audience, and here is the fence, or gate, that separates you.
The attorneys
can go inside the gate and they are your mouthpiece, to go talk to God for
you and see if they can get you off, and the lawyers will be the mediator
between God, or the judge who judges you, and man. That is where all of
this comes from in our society today.
Jordan Maxwell, Matrix of Power
Sheriff in the ancient Egyptian was a lawgiver and his badge was always a
six pointed star which is another symbol of Saturn.
US Sheriffs in the wild
west up to today still wear the six pointed star. It is interesting that
Saturns symbol is the six pointed star, Saturn in the 6th planet from the
sun, Saturnday is the 6th day of the week, and now NASA is receiving images
of the Saturn Hexagram (6 sided) atmospheric formation at Saturns poles.
The 6th chakra of the human energy system is the 3rd
eye/pineal gland (6, 3 times = 666). When your 3rd eye chakra opens you
develop your 6th sense of intuition and spirituality. From a consciousness
perspective, the 6th sense, your intuitions/hunches, are messengers of god,
your guardian angels.
Isnt it interesting that angels have haloes/rings
around their heads and Saturn is the only planet with a halo/ring around it?
That is why today, when you get married, you
get married before God. And the symbol of that God is the ring that is put
on each
other's fingers. The ring of Saturn. In the marriage phrases, one also
begins to see
what that has to do with Saturn.
So when you get married, you get married
with a ring
and the symbol of that God is the ring, the ring of Saturn. You're wearing
God's ring.
And the yarmulke was the round ring that you wear on your head, for Saturn
your
God. Even in the middle ages, in the temples, Catholic monks would shave
their heads
in a round circle, and the Hebrews,
instead of doing that, would wear the
yarmulke. But it all had to do with the
round rings of Saturn.

The ancient name of Saturn was, as mentioned, EL. It is the reason why
those that were chosen by EL, were called Elites. In fact the words, Elect,
Elder, Elevated, Elohim, Temple, Circle, Gospel, Apostle, Disciple,
Evangelists, etc., all derive from the Cult of EL.
Angels are messengers of
god. But god was EL, which is why we have the names of the Archangels
bearing the el, suffix Raphael, Michael, Uriel, Gabriel, etc,.
Michael Tsarion, Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology
The plural term Elohim appears over 2500 times in the Old Testament but is
falsely translated in most versions. This fact of plurality explains why in
Genesis Gods said, Let us make man in our image.
As stated, Elohim
refers to both gods and goddesses, and its singular form, El, served as
a prefix or suffix to names of gods, people and places, whence EmmanuEl,
GabriEl, BethEl, etc. Even Satan was one of the Elohim.
Acharya S., The
Christ Conspiracy (67)
The gods of ELohim are angELs, the messengers of god.
When witches cast a speEL, they put the Hex (6) on someone, and when chefs deep fry something,
they Deep 6 it. It is the ELites who run the world today. Elite comes from
the IsraElites which came from the Egyptian worship of the Moon (Isis),
the Sun, (Ra), and Saturn (Elohim), hence IsRaEl.
Jews and Muslims alike worship a huge black cube/box called Kabba at Mecca.
Their god
YHWH is known as the Tetragramaton meaning their 4 letter
(4 sided?) God. The Kabballah of Jewish mysticism/Masonry comes from
KabbaAllah or CubeGod around which
people gather and ceremonially walk in circles.
Thus it can be said they are
circling the square. Masons are also constantly referring to circling the
square and squaring the circle.
For instance, this is why a boxing
match is fought for rounds in the ring but it is actually a 4 sided
square arena with corners.
The Freemasonic G (Geometry/God) symbol within a compass and T-square
symbolizes this as well. Just as people circle around their Cube-God Kabba,
so the Masons use a compass/square around their G God/Geometry.
In Islamic tradition, the Rock is where Muhammad ascended to Heaven
accompanied by the angel Gabriel. The Dome of the Rock was built in the
600 AD era and was won back by the Israelites on 06/07/67 after the 6 day
war. The Domes outer walls measure 60 (6x10) feet wide and 36 (6x6) feet
high.
The Knights Templar claimed the Dome of the Rock was the site of the
Temple of Solomon and set up their Templum Domini adjacent to it during
the 12th century.
Saturn is an important key to understanding the long heritage this
conspiracy has back to antiquity. The city of Rome was originally known as
Saturnia or City of Saturn. The Roman Catholic church retains much of the
Saturn worship in its ritual. Saturn also relates to Lucifer. In various
occult dictionaries Saturn is associated with evil. Saturn was important to
the religion of Mithra, and also the Druids.
Fritz
Springmeier, Bloodlines of the Illuminati
Rome was known to the Romans as Saturnia, not Rome, and Saturn was one of
their gods.
Black is both Saturns color and Satans color. The black holy
bible tells us Satan is 666. Saturn is the 6th planet, its symbol is a
6pointed star, it supposedly has hexagon weather formations, and Saturnday
the 6th day, is Ozzy Osbournes Black Sabbath.
Also highlighting this
theme, the Rolling Stones sang Paint it Black, Paint it Blue, Blue Turns
to Grey, Black Angel, XXX and Sympathy for the Devil.
A bruise is black and
blue; bruise like the Hebrews whose longstanding secret societies are
orchestrating this blue/black agenda. The 6th chakra, the pineal gland, the
3rd eye (all the same thing) is usually represented with the color blue, but
they seem intent on Painting it Black.
The Stones lyrics go,
I see a red
door and I want it painted black, no colors anymore I want them to turn
black. No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I want them to turn
black.
When youre hit you get a black eye (supposedly, though the bruise is
usually other colors), but the real black eye is your 3rd eye; The chakra
which should be colored blue, but they have changed to black. This most
important organ has in recent centuries shrunk in size from about the size
of a quarter, to the size of a pea.
The Black Eyed Peas ironically sing a
song called Third Eye with lyrics like,
I got three eyes, one look from the
left side, the other from the right side, got one eye on the
inside, and I can see you outside, plottin to come in.
Also in the same song,
If Bush is Pinocchio, who the hell
is Gepetto? Beware of Gepetto. I could point out their
behavior to keep yimmune from the poisonous flavor, but
once youre caught I cant save ya, theyll manipulate
your mind so you enjoy danger.
The band Third Eye
Blind has a song called Eye Conqueror.
