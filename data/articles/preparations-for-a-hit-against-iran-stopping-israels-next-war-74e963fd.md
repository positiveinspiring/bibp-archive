A new war in the region is inevitable.
This is the pronouncement made by
Mohammad Seyyed Selim, political scientist and professor at the universities
of Cairo and Kuweit.
Prof. Selim delivered his forecast on February 13, in a
program on Nile TVs Cairo Watch, in which I also participated. The
moderator, Mohamed Abdel-Rahim, started off by asking what crisis situations
in the region were most acute; Iran and the Arab-Israeli conflict were the
obvious answers.
That war is on the agenda, Selim noted, is beyond doubt. Israeli political
and military leaders have been broadcasting such bellicose intentions loudly
enough for the deaf to hear. Yossi Peled said he thought conflict with
Hezbollah was inevitable.
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman warned the
Syrian government that if it were to intervene in an Israeli-Lebanese
conflict, it would disintegrate. As if that were not sufficient, the Israeli Mossad had staged a Hollywood-style extravaganza to murder Hamas leader
Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai on January 20.
Four days later, Netanyahu
declared that Israel would maintain control over parts of the West Bank for
all eternity.
He followed up with the announcement that Israel would
designate three sites on the West Bank as part of Israels national
heritage. These were all deliberately crafted provocations, aimed solely at
eliciting a violent response from the other side: perhaps that Hezbollah
would kidnap an Israeli soldier, or that Hamas would lob a few rockets
across the border to Israel.
Fortunately, to date, their response has been
measured.
Whenever Israel threatens military action against Hamas, Hezbollah, and/or
Syria, it is certain that the actual target is Iran. This was the case in
the 2006 war in Lebanon, and in the 2008 year-end aggression against Gaza.
(See: The Target is Iran: Israels Latest Gamble May Backfire).
As a
preparation for a hit against the Islamic Republic in both cases, Tel Aviv
was attempting to remove from the scene, or at least weaken, those factors
in the region which could respond militarily and politically. Israel lost
both wars, albeit at a heavy price for the civilians of the targeted
populations.
Now it is gearing up for renewed attacks, in tandem with an
artfully orchestrated international campaign around Irans alleged nuclear
bomb program.
The targeted nations and political movements are well aware of this fact. It
is no coincidence that the leaders of those forces joined in a public
display of solidarity on March 4 in Damascus. As pictured in major media,
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad hosted talks with Iranian President
Ahmadinejad and Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrullah. Hamas leader
Khaled Meshaal and other Palestinian rejection front representatives were
also on hand. There is no need to inquire into the agenda of their talks.
They are preparing for the worst case scenario: a direct Israeli attack.(1)
Whether or not the ongoing escalation will spark conflict - one that would
quickly spread beyond the region - will depend on several interrelated
considerations:
-
First, will the U.S. embrace the suicidal option of
endorsing and/or joining an Israeli preemptive strike against Irans
nuclear facilities?
-
As a corollary, will leading Arab states allow
themselves to be pummeled into acquiescing to yet another disastrous
conflict?
-
Then, will the Iranians fall into the trap being laid for them,
and react according to profiles drafted in psychological warfare
think-tanks, by responding in terms of brinkmanship?
-
Or will they elude the
trap with determined but cool-headed political and diplomatic initiatives?
-
Further, will other world powers, namely Russia and especially China, wield
their clout to prevent such a scenario?
-
Finally, will the growing censure of
Israeli methods catalyze a change inside Israel itself?
The Casus Belli: Nuclear Energy
Ostensibly, the impetus for renewed calls to attack Iran came after Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced on February 11 that scientists had
achieved 20% enrichment.
There followed the ritual exclamations of
condemnation on the part of the major powers, especially those in the 5+1
group (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council
plus Germany who have been engaged in negotiations around the issue).
A week later, the new Director General of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA),
Yukiya Amano, issued his first report on Iran, which all but
the Chinese seized upon like vultures preying on carrion, to claim that it
confirmed Tehrans alleged intentions to build an atom bomb, and to demand
new action to force Tehrans compliance.
A worldwide mobilization unfolded,
spearheaded by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and flanked by the
French and Germans.
Chancellor Angela Merkel chimed in with her vow that
tougher sanctions would be imposed on Iran. Either such sanctions would be
voted up in the U.N. Security Council, or, in the likely event that China
refused, they would be imposed outside the U.N. framework. Merkel went out
of her way to say that the Europeans should declare independent sanctions
(for reasons we will see below). (2)
As for Israel, its leaders turned up
the volume in their demands for crippling sanctions, or else, meaning: if
the international community were not disposed to take effective action
against Iran, then Israel would go it alone with a military strike.
The Nuclear Issue: An Objective Overview
Irans achieving levels of uranium enrichment of 20% entailed nothing
illegal, according to the IAEAs own Non-Proliferation Treaty guidelines. NPT signers like Iran have every right to develop enrichment technology for
civilian energy production purposes.
The
new IAEA report, which the
international press blew utterly out of proportion, nowhere stated that Iran
had violated NPT guidelines.
It said that,
While the Agency continues to
verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, Iran has not
provided the necessary cooperation to permit the Agency to confirm that all
nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities.
(p. 9)
Iran, it said,
had declined to discuss certain issues with the Agency or to provide related
information and access,
asserting that the allegations related to possible
military dimensions to its nuclear programme are baseless and that the
information to which the Agency is referring is based on forgeries.
(p. 9)
The IAEA was accusing Iran of having committed a sin of omission, i.e.
withholding information which the agency would otherwise have required.
The
report recorded that,
Contrary to the relevant resolutions of the Board of
Governors and the Security Council, Iran has continued with the operation of PFEP [Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant] and FEP [Fuel Enrichment Plant] at
Natanz, and the construction of a new enrichment plant at Ferdow. Iran has
also announced the intention to build ten new enrichment plants.
(p. 10)
Again, to repeat the point: there is nothing in the NPT that forbids a
signatory nation to enrich uranium or to build enrichment facilities.
Iran
issued an official rebuttal on March 2. (See Irans Nuclear Program:
Tehrans Reply to the IAEA on the Implementation of Safeguards in Iran, by
the Permanent Mission of Iran to the IAEA".)
Proceeding from the assumption that Irans program is military, the Security
Council has demanded that Iran stop enrichment. To acquire nuclear fuel,
Iran is supposed to ship its low enriched uranium abroad, where it would be
enriched to a higher degree, then sent back for use.
Several versions of
this proposal appeared during late 2009/early 2010, among them, one that
foresees the establishment of an international uranium enrichment bank with
Iranian participation; this might be located in Russia or Kazakhstan, both
leaders in nuclear fuel production. Turkey has voiced its willingness to be
the site for the transfer of Iranian uranium to be further enriched and
shipped home. France and Japan were other options.
Iran has engaged in considerable back-and-forth posturing in response.
It
agreed in principle to enrichment abroad, but insisted on guarantees for
orderly and prompt delivery. It then demanded that the transfer of such
uranium be made on Iranian soil.
Tehrans apparently contradictory stance
reflects deep mistrust, based on past history: France reneged on a nuclear
deal with Iran in the past, and Russia, which completed the Bushehr plant,
postponed delivery of nuclear fuel for years, and even to the present day
continues rescheduling the final start-up date.
In early March, Iran again
expressed willingness to cooperate in a plan to have its uranium enriched
abroad. This time, Japan was in discussion. On March 17, Iran announced its
readiness to exchange 1200 kilograms of low enriched uranium for 120
kilograms of high grade uranium.
Iranian sources say they dont want more
proposals, but a concrete Memorandum of Understanding.
The Nuclear Issue: A Historical Overview
Iran did not start developing nuclear technology yesterday. In 1974, at the
time of Shah Reza Pahlavi, a close ally of the West, Iran had outlined an
ambitious program for introducing nuclear energy as a motor for economic
development.
The plan called for the installation of 23,000 MWe by 1994,
equivalent to 40% of projected national energy consumption, through plants
purchased from France, the U.S. and Germany. The famous Bushehr plant dates
back to this era, when the German firm KWU had the contract. Iran
participated in enrichment facilities in other countries, and was to
purchase its enriched uranium abroad. (3)
This prompts the question: If the U.S. and Europe not only okayed an Iranian
nuclear program, but organized and financed it under the Shah, why is this a
casus belli today?
Prof. Selims explanation is that the target of Western
attacks against Irans program is not the physical program itself, but
rather the scientific and technological know-how that it entails. Iranian
scientists today possess this know-how, and that is what the Israelis, among
others, object to. Israel in fact not only bombed the Iraqis Osirak reactor
in 1981, but, more importantly, conducted a systematic campaign of targeted
assassinations throughout the 1980s against leading Iraqi scientists,
deploying hit squads to kill them whenever they ventured abroad for
scientific conferences, etc. (4)
The program launched under the Shah would
have given Iran nuclear energy, but under the tight control of his Western
sponsors.
Therefore, it was no risk. Today it is a different story, a story
entitled technological apartheid.
Nuclear Power Israel
The issue that the IAEA document (and the international and regional
discussion it has ignited) should have put on the table - but did not - is
Israel.
When reading that report and reviewing the sanctimonious
pronouncements by heads of state about how this bloody Persian Gulf monster
must be stopped, any politically informed person or party must object and
ask:
-
But what about Israel?
-
Why, one should ask, dont we have or demand
such periodic reports on the progress of Israels nuclear program?
-
Why
doesnt U.S. President Obama or Secretary of State Clinton compel Israel to
prove to the international community that it has no intentions of developing
a nuclear weapons program?
Obviously, because it already has one and
everyone knows it. Israel has refused to adhere to the IAEA guidelines or to
sign the NPT.
It has pursued the policy of ambiguity: never admitting it
has nuclear weapons, but always asserting it would never be the first to
deploy them. Current estimates hold that Israel has nuclear weapons and 250
or so warheads to deliver them.
This dont ask/dont tell policy regarding Israels nuclear capability has
been accepted by the international community. When U.S. President
Barack
Obama was asked to name a nuclear power in the region, he could only hem and
haw.
Thus, when Israel, the sole nuclear power in the region, begins to rattle
its sabers, fear sweeps the neighborhood.
On Nile TV, the question arose:
-
Well, what if Iran, in response to the Israeli bomb, were to develop a
nuclear weapons capability?
-
What would that mean for Israel?
In reality:
nothing.
Even if Iran were to test a nuclear weapon, that would not
necessarily destabilize the region, Prof. Selim said. He recalled the
dynamic during the Cold War, and in the later development of nuclear weapons
in Pakistan and India; this did not lead to war, but rather to deterrence. I
had heard the exact same argument from an Israeli strategic analyst during a
conference in Berlin in 2006 on Iran.
He had stated the obvious: if Iran has
nuclear weapons, for us Israelis that is no problem. We have a credible
deterrent.
Now it appears that U.S. policy-shaping circles have also begun to debate
the merits of a containment policy, were Iran to achieve such a capability.
Zbigniew Brzezinski was quoted by the
New York Times saying he thought
containment would function because the Islamic Republic,
may be dangerous, assertive and
duplicitous, but there is nothing in their history to suggest they are
suicidal.
www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/weekinreview/14sanger.html
The same issue is featured in Foreign Affairs magazine.
So the panic and frenzy generated by reports of a possible Iranian bomb are
vastly exaggerated.(5)
Could Israel Go To War?
There is no doubt that the current Israeli establishment is exploiting
hysteria around Irans nuclear program to pursue war against Hezbollah,
Hamas, Syria, and the Islamic Republic itself.
This does not mean they would or could win these
wars. Were the Israeli establishment (God forbid) to attack Iranian nuclear
sites with aerial bombardments all Hell would break loose. Iran would not
roll over and die. Enough scenarios in the public realm make clear that such
an adventure would be militarily futile and politically suicidal. A recent
war games scenario conducted in the U.S. drove this point home again. (See War
Games shows how attacking Iran could backfire.)
There remains the political question: Could war against Iran be thinkable
under the Obama Administration?
To attack, Israel would need a green light
from the Pentagon. The Nile TV moderator wanted to know: Would they get it?
Prof. Selim thought it was indeed possible, an answer which reflected the
widespread disappointment in the Arab world with Obamas actions - as opposed
to his words in highfalutin speeches. I said, yes, anything is possible,
including under an Obama regime, but not inevitable, for one simple reason:
Although it is the U.S. President, as Commander in Chief, who ultimately
makes the decision, there are other powers in the Washington establishment
who shape policy.
Just as the world witnessed under the reign of the
psychologically labile President
George W. Bush, who was personally and
politically committed to war, other factors came into play to thwart his
worst designs. The NIE report of October 2007, which asserted that Iran no
longer had any nuclear weapons program, threw a monkey wrench into the
neocons war plans and postponed war.
Similarly now, military spokesmen from the U.S. have tendered their opinion
that Tehran is not in possession of such weapons, and others have warned
outright against the Israeli use of force.
U.S. General David Petraeus told
Reuters on February 3 that a strike against Iran,
could be used to play
nationalist tendencies.
US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike
Mullen warned Israel against unintended consequences of an attack.
During
his early March visit to Israel, Vice President Joe Biden also told Tel Aviv
hold off on any military adventure. Whatever more radical tendencies in
Washington may exist, the military establishment, which is already
overburdened with the disastrous engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, will
maintain the hardnosed view that war against Iran, from a purely
military-strategic viewpoint, would be folly.
Another alternative being debated in Washington is regime change.
CFR
president Richard N. Haas raised this in Newsweek in late January, arguing
that,
The United States, European governments, and others should shift their
Iran policy toward increasing the prospects for political change.
Measures
would include outspoken support for the Iranian opposition, sanctions, and
new funding for documenting human rights abuses, etc.
Iranian-American Trita
Parsi appears to have come over to this viewpoint as well; if not overt
support, which would be counterproductive, he calls for waiting it out until
things change inside Iran. (6) A number of well-known neocons like
David Frum and William Kristol, are talking up regime change. (7)
If it is true
that the leader of the terrorist Jundullah group in Iran has been
financially and politically controlled by the U.S., this means covert
operations are already well underway.
Such operations would tend to
backfire, and merely exacerbate tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Iranian
history warns against attempted regime changes from abroad.
Israelis Descend on Germany
In its campaign to mobilize political opinion against the perceived
Iranian danger, the Israeli establishment has opened all stops.
Significantly, it was Germany that the Israeli elite chose for its full
court press in Europe. On January 19, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu visited Berlin, together with Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Foreign
Minister Avigdor Lieberman, Industry, Trade, and Labor Minister Benjamin
Ben-Eleizer, Technology Minister Daniel Hershkowitz, and National
Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau.
The group met with the German cabinet in
a joint session which both termed historic.
In their press conference,
Netanyahu and Merkel confirmed that the focus of their talks had been
Tehrans nuclear program, and Germanys historic responsibility to
guarantee Israels security. Israeli President Simon Peres (father of the
Israeli nuclear weapons program), followed on January 26, and was granted
the special honor of addressing the Bundestag,
Peres had many things to say, but the leitmotif of his statements to the
Bundestag and in newspaper interviews was unambiguous:
It is wrong to
consider Iran only as a threat to Israel. The country is a danger for the
entire world, he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (January 23,
2010).
The Iranians want to dominate the Near and Middle East, and cast
their ambitious glance also into Latin America.
It is a new imperialism,
which is religiously motivated and embellished at the same time, said,
adding that there can be no compromise with religious fanatics like those
in Tehran.
Asked what would happen if Iran had the bomb, Peres answered,
The Near East would 100% sure arm itself with nuclear weapons: Turkey,
Saudi Arabia, and Egypt would follow behind. The day that the Iranians were
to have atomic weapons, it would be too late to stop this development.
Ergo, the need for action.
And Germany is obligated to agree:
The special
relationship between Germany and Israel rests more on values than interests.
It is a moral alliance.
Assuming they were addressing a sympathetic audience, the Israelis pressed
for tough sanctions, if not more.
But all did not go quite according to the
script. Not only did demonstrators protest the joint cabinet meeting, but
the Goldstone Report on the Gaza war appeared in a complete German
translation just as the Israelis arrived. In his interview to the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Peres betrayed deep insecurity regarding the
deterioration of Israels image in Germany and the world.
Asked for his
views of the younger generation, he referred to polls,
which surprised me:
in them, some Germans consider Israel more dangerous than Iran.
He said
Germany and Israel were bound to fight anti-Semitism, racism, etc.,
worldwide, but that they should not forget that,
Israel at the same time is
still endangered. This the young Germans do not understand.
Asked outright
if his country were losing respect worldwide (outside the U.S.), Peres
retorted,
Thats not true. On the contrary: Israel is the
most beloved
country in the world, a claim he backed up by pointing to excellent
relations with the Catholic church and the Evangelicals (who are the
biggest Zionists ever), cooperation with populous nations like India and
China, and so on.
He also stated,
The best place for Jews is Israel; that
also goes for Germany.
When interviewers Frankenberger and Roessler
insisted that Israel had lost sympathies in Europe, Peres admitted there
might be problems with some countries,
but name me one country in the
whole world that has as much support as Israel...
Then, confronted on the
Gaza war, Peres lashed out,
The
Goldstone Report is a scandal and charged
the U.N. with being a political organization with an automatic majority
against Israel.
The Gaza war, he concluded, was a highly complicated
affair.
But we are accused of having killed Arab civilians deliberately.
That is crazy!
Are Sanctions Possible, and Effective?
The Israeli deployment to Berlin was the opening salvo of a campaign aimed
at arm-twisting reluctant members of the U.N. Security Council to impose
tougher sanctions on Iran.
Netanyahu went to Moscow, while Barak went with
Moshe Yaalon and Stanley Fischer to Beijing. Clinton took off for a parallel
tour through the Persian Gulf and then to Latin America.
The U.S. Secretary of State did her best to convince the Saudis that they
should jump on the anti-Iran bandwagon, but the response was tepid. Clinton
also urged the Saudis to use the oil weapon vis-a-vis China, that is, to
promise Beijing larger fuel supplies in a bid to win the Chinese over to
sanctions.
The Jordan Times quoted a Saudi foreign policy official on
February 17 to the effect that the Kingdom did not see the value of
sanctions, and ruled out any military action.
We do not want a military
strike, he said; A military strike, we still believe, will be very
counterproductive.
Instead, Riyadh urged the U.S. to regain credibility by
finally doing something on the Palestinian-Israeli front.
In Brazil, she
received a cold shoulder when she proposed that President Lula de Silva join
in punitive actions against Iran. The Brazilian president insisted Iran had
the same right as his country to nuclear energy technology.
At the time of this writing it is highly unlikely that the U.N. Security
Council could agree on crippling sanctions against Iran.
A draft prepared
by the UK, France, the US, and Germany, then shared with Russia and China in
early March considered toothless financial sanctions: the Iranian Central
Bank would remain immune, but any new banks set up abroad would be affected.
Russia ruled out any restrictions of military sales (such as the S-300
missiles it is to deliver) and China maintained its opposition.
China, whose
political leadership was not amused by Obamas plans for weapons sales to
Taiwan or his gracious hospitality towards the Dalai Lama, could wield its
veto right, and that would be the end of that. Aside from Chinas principled
stance against interference into the internal affairs of a sovereign nation,
it has other good reasons to reject sanctions: Iran is a major supplier of
its oil and gas, and China is Irans number one foreign trade partner,
accounting for 14% of its imports and exports in 2008.
China and Iran are
the two external poles of the land-bridge rail corridors across Eurasia,
which are creating the transportation infrastructural networks for
integrating the economies of the vast land mass.
If China were to forego its veto right and merely abstain in a UNSC vote,
still there is no guarantee that the U.S. would get the required 9 out of 15
votes from among the non-permanent members, to pass a resolution. Rotating
member Brazil sees eye to eye with Iran on both ideological and economic
planes, and has no reason to endorse sanctions. Nor does Turkey.
Lebanon,
also a rotating member, finds itself on Israels hit list alongside Iran.
If the Security Council were to fail to reach an agreement on new sanctions,
then the losers could go for actions outside that venerable and discredited
body. Angela Merkels option, to sanction Iran on the basis of a coalition
of the willing, could come onto the table.
Would sanctions work? Yes and no.
To be sure, Iran has suffered under
economic embargo conditions over the past 30 years since the Islamic
Revolution. The all-too-frequent airplane crashes reported in Iran are often
the result of outmoded, decrepit aircraft and the lack of adequate spare
parts for repair.
Now talk of new measures spread in the climate of a
possible new war has encouraged some economic players to opt out. Several
important firms, among them the German Siemens, have recently pulled out of
Iran out of fear of a new conflict and/or concern about the
economic/political fallout of increased regional tensions. Siemens chief
executive Peter Löscher, made the announcement while Peres was in Berlin.
Under U.S. pressure, German credit guarantees for Iran have been steadily
dwindling over past years, though some smaller firms have remained. Germany
is still Irans foremost trading partner in Europe. Paolo Scaroni, chief
executive of the Italian energy firm ENI, announced on February 4 that it
would leave Iran, after completion of current contracts to develop gas
fields. (8)
Sanctions would likely end up hurting the population, not the
government.
A Rational Way Out
Neither sanctions nor a new Israeli military assault in the region represent
any solution to the problem. Either move would only worsen conditions. A new
war would spell catastrophe for all.
If there is to be a rational way out, the U.S. is going to have to develop a
policy for the region.
Right now, in lieu of a policy, it is running a
three-ring circus: in one ring is the giant America, flexing its muscles to
hold back mad dog Israel on a leash with a muzzle; in the next ring are a
trio of monkeys clipping the tail of peacock Iran, while Russian bears and
Chinese pandas taunt them; and in the third ring is a dog-and-pony show
featuring a Palestinian and an Israeli, endlessly going through the motions
of the peace process dance. Meanwhile U.S. and allied military patrol the
circus grounds to ensure that no one interrupt the performances.
A serious policy would entail a package comprised of one-on-one negotiations
with Iran to reach a workable solution to the nuclear issue, and a
commitment to overcome the 60-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict by exerting
international political and economic pressure to force Israel to come to
terms with reality. To draft a policy one would have to take the region as a
whole into consideration and recognize Irans potentially positive role as a
major economic and geostrategic factor.
Removing Irans pariah status
requires settling the nuclear issue in a mutually satisfactory fashion. In
addition to the nuclear program, Iran is under attack for its support of rejectionist Palestinian forces and their allies (Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria).
Were a comprehensive, just peace to be achieved between Israel and the
Palestinians, that could change. There was a time when official Iranian
policy was that Tehran would accept whatever the Palestinians agreed upon.
Rhetoric notwithstanding, that could become the case again.
Syria is also
ready for peace, on condition the Golan Heights are returned, and so on.
-
First, Iran: What the Iranians want is nothing out of the ordinary. Tehran
demands a square deal with the West, in the form of a direct dialogue with
Washington, and/or in the 5+1 format on an equal footing. If the issue is
honest concern about Irans military ambitions, then they should settle it
through a workable compromise, allowing Iran to trade its low-grade uranium
for high-grade.
Where, when, and how are the subject of talks, not the
precondition. This approach may be gaining ground among some in Germany.
Volker Perthes of the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, wrote
an OpEd for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on March 7, entitled, The
West should make an approach to Iran.
He proposed accepting Irans bid to
keep 800 kilos of enriched uranium there under IAEO control, then exchange
it for fuel rods. The West should seek cooperation with Iran in stabilizing
Afghanistan and fighting drugs.
In his view, if Iran did cross the threshold
to military use, the U.S. missile defense systems in the region would
provide a regional shield. (Several reports have stressed that the
deployment aims at preventing Israel from moving militarily.)
-
Then, Israel: A solution to the decades-long conflict requires a totally new
approach. Prof. Selim believes the time has come for the Arabs to redefine
the relationship of forces, essentially junking all the proposals that have
yielded nothing but betrayed hopes over the past years. It is time for the
Arabs to stop making concessions in exchange for nothing.
The most recent
example of the capitulationist syndrome came in the Arab Leagues acceptance
(under massive U.S. and Western pressure) of indirect talks with the
Israelis, even without a halt to Israeli settlements.
Then, just as Joe
Biden arrived for talks in Israel, the government announced approval for
1,600 new homes in Arab East Jerusalem. Apologies for the timing of the
announcement only added insult to injury.
The Palestinians then had to
declare they would reject any talks.
But, for how long?
Vice President Bidens sharp rebuke, followed by Clintons telephone blast
at Netanyahu, was an important signal; it communicated to the Israelis that
there are limits to how they can treat their leading ally and a superpower.
To shift Israeli policy, however, the U.S. must
move beyond rebukes. According to the March 17 New York Times, this crisis
between Israel and the U.S., characterized by many as the worst in decades,
is prompting Washington to consider an independent approach. The idea is
that such a new American plan would catalyze a shift inside Israel,
leading to the formation of a new ruling coalition.
Shaking up the internal Israeli equation is indeed what is required. But
how?
Economic pressure, in the form of a total freeze on all U.S. aid to
Israel, combined with a suspension of E.U. privileges to Israel, would have
an effect. Whatever the elements of the new approach being mulled in
Washington, clearly a complete stop of all settlement activity is a
prerequisite. Instead of sabotaging the Hamas, the U.S. should facilitate
the Fatah-Hamas rapprochement (which Prof. Selim believes could succeed) to
allow for a united Palestinian front including democratically elected
forces, to represent their people.
The criminal blockade of Gaza must be
lifted. Without such actions, there can be no illusion of credibility on the
part of a new U.S. approach. Such gestures are indicative of what the
Arabs require to redefine the relationship of forces. If the two-state
solution is policy, that means an end to the occupation. Reportedly, the
Quartet meeting in Moscow on March 18 touched on these issues.
Judging by past performance, any Israeli government would reject such
demands out of hand, just as Netanyahu has continued to refuse a halt to
settlement expansion. But, as one leading think-tanker put, the time of
truth has come in U.S.-Israeli relations.
Washington does have the power,
if it wants to use it.
Subjectively, the time could not be more propitious for a concerted
international drive to force a transformation in Tel Aviv. Israels standing
in the world has been vanishing like snow under a hot spring sun, as even
President Peres was forced to recognize. Israeli diplomats no longer feel
free to travel abroad, fearing that international arrest warrants might be
slapped on them as perpetrators of war crimes committed during the Gaza war.
As reported in the March 15 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Israeli
government has launched a desperate public relations campaign, through a
website for Public Diplomacy and the Diaspora, aimed at preparing Israelis
to project a positive image of their country while traveling abroad. If
citizens have to study government-issued brochures handed out at the
airport, to learn how to defend the reputation of Israel, then the moral
crisis the country has entered is quicksand.
In this moral confrontation, the
Goldstone Report is a precious asset.
The
United Nations General Assembly voted on February 26 (98 to 7, with 31
abstentions, 56 not voting) to extend the call to Israel and the Palestinian
Authority, by 5 months, to carry on investigations into the reports
findings. The E.U. declared on March 10 it would endorse the Goldstone
Report.
Tel Avivs pathetic attempt to quash it by furnishing pro forma
responses instead of conducting an honest inquiry into the allegations has
faltered utterly.
Then, after reports of the Mossads spectacular show in
the Dubai assassination grabbed headlines throughout Europe, governments in
Berlin, Paris, London, and so forth had to make an ostentatious display of
protest. (Whether or not the intelligence services of these countries had
actually played along with the Mossad, making passports and identities
available to their friendly Israeli secret services, the fallout in the
public realm has been such as to totally blacken the already tarnished image
of the Mossad and Israel itself.)
International pressure can become a powerful weapon, as seen in the response
to the Gaza war. And such pressure from outside Israel can contribute to
strengthening those inside the country which have mustered the civil courage
to speak out.
To date, those forces inside Israel, no matter how outspoken
or militant, have not yet managed to unite in a single, national political
movement capable of challenging and eventually replacing the status quo. As
German journalist and Middle East expert Peter Scholl-Latour has often
remarked, the tragedy is that there is no one political party inside Israel
which is really for peace.
That remains to be created.
It may yet come into being. If so, it will come into being as a result of a
profound crisis that shatters the self-confidence of the Israeli elite, a
crisis triggered by growing awareness internationally of the fact that the
Israeli establishment has engaged, yes, in war crimes in Gaza, in violations
of international law by its Mossad hit squads, in continuing violations of
human rights against the occupied Palestinian population, and so on and so
forth.
As I argue in my book (8), the Israeli elite and popular mindset must
face these facts and must change.
Israel needs such a healthy crisis, a
crisis of moral, political, military, and cultural dimensions, which casts
into doubt the historical justification of the Zionist experience, and thus
the raison detre of Israel.
That process of profound critical rethinking
among some Israeli intellectuals (like Ilan Pappe and Avraham Burg) is
underway.
Now is the time for international political action to move the
process forward.
Notes
1. Prior to that gathering, they had each made public what Israel should
expect in that event. Syrian Foreign Minister al-Muallem was quoted by Al
Jazeera on February 7, saying, If war breaks out in the region... it will
be widespread even if it is waged against [only] southern Lebanon or Syria.
He warned Israel that if it attacked, the war will move into your cities.
It was not Hezbollah, but the Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri who said,
there wont be division in Lebanon... We will stand against Israel. We will
stand with our own people, PressTV reported on February 1.
2. The British had earlier put military action on the table. British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, in January hearings on the intelligence failures
leading to war against Iraq in 2003, not only reaffirmed the correctness of
his stance then, but added that the same applied to Iran today. Prime
Minister Gordon Browns subsequent testimony in early March only seconded
his judgment.
