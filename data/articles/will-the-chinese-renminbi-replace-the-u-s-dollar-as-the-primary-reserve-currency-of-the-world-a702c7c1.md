Most Americans have no idea what a tremendous
advantage the United States possesses by having the primary reserve currency
of the world, and most Americans also have no idea how close the U.S. dollar
is to losing that status.
For the past 40 years, the vast majority of all
global trade (including the buying and selling of oil) has been done in U.S.
dollars.
That is still the case today, but things are
starting to shift. All over the globe international agreements are being
made to move away from the U.S. dollar and to use other currencies in global
trade.
The second largest economy in the world, China,
has been particularly aggressive in seeking to change the existing financial
order.
As you will see below, China has been running
all over the planet making agreements with other nations to start conducting
an increasing amount of trade in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. And
of course the Chinese are heavily promoting their own currency -
the renminbi.
So why is this happening? Well, for one thing,
the truth is that the United States is not the only superpower in the world
anymore.
The Chinese economy is actually projected to
become larger than the U.S. economy by 2016, and by some measurements the
Chinese economy
is already larger. So Chinese leaders have been very open about the fact
that they believe that it just doesn't make sense that the vast majority of
all global trade should continue to be conducted in U.S. dollars, especially
considering the reckless money printing that the Federal Reserve has been
doing.
At a time when the status of the U.S. dollar is
already slipping,
QE3 is deeply undermining confidence in U.S. currency. And when the U.S.
dollar does lose reserve currency status, the consequences for the United
States are going to be absolutely catastrophic.
Sadly, most Americans don't even know what a
"reserve currency" is or that the U.S. dollar is under attack.
The Chinese have not only been talking about
cutting the legs out from under the U.S. dollar - they have been actively
doing it.
The following is an excerpt from a recent story
by
Alan Wheatley, a global economics correspondent for Reuters...
Fed up with
what it sees as Washington's malign neglect of the dollar, China is
busily promoting the cross-border use of its own currency, the yuan,
also known as the renminbi, in trade and investment.
The aim is
both narrowly commercial - to reduce transaction costs for Chinese
exporters and importers - and sweepingly strategic.
Displacing
the dollar, Beijing says, will reduce volatility in oil and commodity
prices and belatedly erode the exorbitant privilege' the United States
enjoys as the issuer of the reserve currency at the heart of a post-war
international financial architecture it now sees as hopelessly outmoded.
The mainstream media in the United States is
almost entirely ignoring these developments, but the truth is that all of
this is a very, very big deal.
The following are just some of the international
currency agreements that China has made in the last couple of years...
Most U.S. economists dismiss this threat by
pointing out that China has stockpiled so many U.S. dollars and so much U.S.
debt that if anything happens to the U.S. financial system China would be
significantly damaged as well.
That may be true to a certain extent, but what
is also true is that most Americans fundamentally misunderstand our
relationship with China. Most Americans believe that we are "friends" with
China just because they are conducting massive amounts of trade with us.
Sadly, that is not how the Chinese see us. They
see us as "the competition", and they very much plan on coming out on top in
the end.
Right now, the Chinese are stockpiling mind
blowing amounts of gold. They are preparing for the day when the U.S. dollar
crashes and when hard assets will be the place to be.
And some are even speculating that the Chinese
may be planning to back their own currency with gold at some point.
The following is an excerpt from a recent
article by
Christopher K. Potter, the president of Northern Border Capital
Management...
For three thousand years China has been at
the forefront of monetary innovation. It was the first to legalize gold
money in the tenth century BC and two millennia later it issued the
worlds first paper currency.
Fast forward to 2012 and China is at it
again, eclipsing Australia as the largest producer of gold and
increasing its monetary gold reserves at an alarming rate. Five years
ago China surpassed the US in gold production and five years from now it
will own more gold than the US Federal government.
Do not dismiss this as just another example
of Chinas insatiable appetite for natural resources. It is not. China
is preparing for a world beyond the inconvertible paper dollar, a world
in which the renminbi, buttressed by gold, becomes the dominant reserve
currency.
Lest anyone doubt Chinas resolve, just
consider the following:
-
the Chinese government has recently
removed all restrictions on personal ownership of gold
-
legalized domestic gold exchange
traded funds
-
is currently purchasing 100% of
domestic gold mine production; has imported over 750 tons of
gold (27% of global output) in the last 12 months
-
stated publically its intention to
add 1,000 tons per year to its central bank gold reserves
-
is buying major stakes in foreign
gold mining companies. The scale of this initiative is
extraordinary
When the U.S. financial system crashes, what do
you think the rest of the world is going to want - paper U.S. currency that
is rapidly becoming worthless or renminbi backed by gold?
China is very serious about this effort to hoard
gold. Reportedly, the amount of gold that China has imported
in 2012 alone is greater than the total amount of gold that the European
Central Bank is officially holding.
And China is gobbling up gold mining operations
all over the planet at a staggering rate. I discussed this extensively in a
previous article
that you can find here.
Okay, so what happens if the rest of the world
starts rejecting the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency and starts moving to
other currencies such as the Chinese renminbi?
The change would potentially be dramatic.
Up until now, there has been a constantly
growing demand for more dollars from the rest of the globe. They have needed
dollars to buy oil and to trade with one another.
All of this demand has kept the value of the
U.S. dollar up. But if the rest of the globe started rejecting the dollar,
it would drop like a rock.
When the value of the dollar declines, imports
become more expensive.
So the price of oil would go higher and you
would pay more for gasoline at the gas pump.
And since just about everything is made outside
the country these days, just about everything you buy at Wal-Mart would
become significantly more expensive.
The era of endless super cheap imports would be
over and our standard of living would experience a massive adjustment.
So just how bad could things get?
Well, how would your life change if you went to
the store a couple of years from now and the cost of everything was double
or triple what it is today?
Yes, I know that sounds dramatic, but a major
currency crisis coupled with reckless money printing by the Federal Reserve
could actually produce such an outcome.
So enjoy those cheap imports while you still
can. The days of the U.S. dollar being the sole primary reserve currency of
the world are numbered, and when the dollar dies it is probably going to
happen very rapidly.
