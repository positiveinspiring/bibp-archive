You may have wondered:
"Whats the difference between having a bank
account at Bank of America and having an offshore bank account?"
The truth is, theres possibly all the
difference in the world.
First and foremost, almost all of the banking systems in Western countries
are fundamentally unsoundleveraged to the hilt and backed by an insolvent
governments promises.
Just look at the bank deposit confiscation that occurred in Cyprus on a
seemingly ordinary Saturday morningwhen the people would least suspect it.
That wasnt an aberration; it could happen in any country.
History shows us that when governments get into financial trouble, they
arent shy about plundering the people. Often this occurs through the
currency or the banking system.
According to Judge Andrew Napolitano:
"People who have more than $100,000 in the
bank are targets for any government thats looking for money to shore up
its own inability to manage its finances."
The way you protect yourself is by placing your
savings in an offshore bank, which is outside the immediate reach of your
insolvent home government.
If you look to bank in a jurisdiction with low debt and a history of a
stability, you can find banks that are much better capitalized and otherwise
sounder than those in the US. Often these banks will pay you much higher
interest rates as well.
An offshore bank account also protects you from being paralyzed by a
lightning seizure by any government agency armed with a summary power to
freeze your assets, since such summary powers cant reach beyond the US. If
you ever find yourself in a wrestling match with a government agency or with
a frivolous lawsuit, youll have resources you can count on.
Despite what you may hear, offshore banking is completely legal and is not
about tax evasion or other illegal activities.
Its simply about legally diversifying your
political risk by putting your liquid savings in sound, well-capitalized
institutions where theyre treated best.

The Best Offshore Banks That I Used
by
Streber
May 24, 2013
from
InternationalMan Website
Editors note:
The
information in this article
is
based on Streber's personal experiences
and
has not been independently verified.
As
always, do your own due diligence.
This is a list of the best offshore banks that I
have used.
The word "used" refers to myself having an
account, card or other services with the bank, or a bank which any of the
companies I deal with as a director or consultant uses.
There will be no Caribbean banks here. This does
not mean that banks in Belize, Dominica, Bahamas, St. Vincent, and so on are
not good. It simply means I do not yet have enough experience with any of
them.
Anyway, without further ado, here are the best
offshore banks, in no particular order.
Bank: Jyske
Bank
Jurisdiction: Gibraltar
Time with bank: 3 years
Purpose: Company
bank account for Gibraltar company
Jyske Bank stands out in terms of service and
competitive fees.
Their Netbank (online banking) has never been
down, and I have never had a card purchase declined due to problems with the
bank. They have competitive interest rates, and they have helped set up a
very good low- to medium-risk investment portfolio for the company's
savings.
For those interested in opening an account,
Jyske Bank requires all the usual documents (notarized passport and company
documents) and an opening deposit of 150,000 EUR.
Being in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)
region helps for cheap and quick transfers across Europe.
Bank: HSBC
Jurisdiction: Hong Kong
Time with bank: 2 years
Purpose: Company
bank account for Seychelles IBC
Very easy-going bank with excellent telephone
support.
Account opening and maintenance are a breeze. A
low minimum balance makes this bank a good fit for my small Seychelles-based
company. For accounts held by non-resident companies, they issue only
UnionPay ATM cards (accepted in over 100 countries), which is usually not a
problem, unless a company credit card, such as Visa, MasterCard, or Amex, is
required.
Their internet banking has not been down a single time outside of
maintenance.
Minimum balance varies depending on account type
but for smaller companies, an Integrated Account is enough with a minimum of
25,000 HKD being required. If you fall below that, they charge a rather
humble 50 HKD per month.
Multi-currency by default. For company accounts,
a director must visit the bank in purpose.
For personal accounts, you must visit the bank.
Bank: Hang
Seng
Jurisdiction: Hong Kong
Time with bank: 1.5 years
Purpose: Company
account for Hong Kong company
Hang Seng is owned by HSBC and products are
nearly identical.
The reason we decided to go with Hang Seng over
HSBC was that Hang Seng has slightly lower fees and is much more lenient
with issuing business cards.
Bank: Crèdit
Andorrà
Jurisdiction: Andorra
Time with bank: 3+ years
Purpose: Personal
savings
This bank is simply amazing. All accounts are
multi-currency, and they support a lot of currencies, including some
less-common ones. Transfers into and out of Europe are faster than
mainstream European banks, and within Europe its usually as fast as SEPA
despite not being a SEPA enabled bank.
Fees are higher than mainstream European banks,
which can be offset by using the bank's huge selection of investment
opportunities. Credit Andorra gives you access to stocks, bonds, funds, and
equities around the world. See
here for
more information.
For your own security (as well as privacy) you
can generate an endless number of virtual cards (called Cybertargetas) with
the bank. These cards can hold up to 2,000 EUR.
Customer service speaks Catalan, Spanish,
French, English, and more.
There is no minimum balance for opening a
personal account. The requirement for private banking varies; the lowest
Ive heard was 50,000 EUR. You must visit the bank in person to open an
account.
Private banking is also available with the
banks Panamanian branch.
Bank: Banquede
Luxembourg (BDL)
Jurisdiction: Luxembourg
Time with bank: 20+ years
Purpose: Luxembourg
trust
Excellent returns on investment funds, and
highly professional staff.
The trust had been with this bank long before I
was involved and I have found no reason to recommend another bank.
Bank: Abu
Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB)
Jurisdiction: United Arab Emirates
(UAE)
Time with bank: 4 years
Purpose: Company
account for UAE (RAK) company
This is one of my preferred banks in the Middle
East.
There have been times when we have needed to
call our account manager in the middle of the night local time, and he has
been happy to take the call - and solve the issue!
They offer a special credit card for smaller
businesses, which is something I wish more banks did. The card is easy to
get and can be invaluable to new businesses.
ADCB is also a big merchant bank with settlement
in a wide range of currencies.
New accounts can be opened with as little as AED
50,000 (around 10,000 EUR or $13,500 USD) to avoid penalty fees, and all
accounts are multi-currency, which in addition to the usual EUR, USD, GBP,
and local AED covers some other regional currencies.
Islamic banking is
available.
Bank: Banque
Audi
Jurisdiction: Lebanon
Time with bank: 4 years
Purpose: Savings
products for UAE (RAK) company
Lebanon was chosen for its extremely tight
banking secrecy, and Banque Audi had the services best fitting for this
company (cash collection, savings).
The interest rates on savings accounts are
phenomenal and the staff is always helpful. Rigorous application process but
smooth sailing after that (very few questions asked).
Bank: United
Overseas Bank (UOB)
Jurisdiction: Singapore
Time with bank: 1 year
Purpose: Company
account for Singapore company
This bank is a fairly new acquaintance, but so
far, it's been nothing short of excellent. Multi-currency accounts,
top-notch customer service (in English), and simple account opening and
credit card applications.
Contrary to its name, UOB is not particularly
open to offshore companies and have recently made it even more difficult for
overseas individuals to open accounts.
They will and do open accounts for some offshore
companies (especially Hong Kong and other surrounding Asian countries), but
European or American (including Caribbean) individuals or companies may find
it difficult.
Bank: Multibank
Jurisdiction: Panama
Time with bank: 2+ years
Purpose: Savings
account for Panamanian holding company
Anyone who has ever opened - or tried to open - an account in Panama knows that it can feel like taking a deep dive into an
ocean of paperwork. I walked out of several banks shaking my head at the
amount of paperwork required. Multibank, however, made it easy.
They still required a lot of paperwork, but they
were very upfront about what they needed.
They have some very interesting card products,
and it's all very international-friendly since the bank uses USD as standard
currency. Account opening can be very difficult for non-Panamanian entities
or persons. Multi-currency is available but not standard.
Minimum deposit varies from $1,000 to $35,000
USD, depending on service needed.
Bank: Federal
Bank of Middle East (FBME)
Jurisdiction: Cyprus and Tanzania
Time with bank: 5 years
Purpose: Merchant
accounts for various offshore companies
FBME is, for many, the go-to bank in Cyprus, and
rightfully so.
The bank traces its roots back to Lebanon and is
currently one of the biggest banks in the high-risk merchant account market
- not because of their rates but because of their leniency and how easy it
is to get a merchant account with them. They also offer an impressive range
of card products, such as prepaid cards, anonymous no-name cards, and
regular credit cards, including the exclusive Visa Infinite card.
FBME in Cyprus rarely opens personal accounts.
They are mostly a corporate and merchant bank. Unlike many other Cypriot
banks, FBME has virtually zero exposure to Greece and even offered to help
the Cypriot government pay for a bail-out in the 2011/2012 crisis.
FBME charges fairly high fees, which can be a
bit daunting to small companies, but I would say it's worth it. No Cypriot
bank comes close to FBME.
Editors Note:
Things can change quickly. New options
emerge, while others disappear. This is why it's so important to have the
most up-to-date and accurate information possible. That's where
International Man comes in.
