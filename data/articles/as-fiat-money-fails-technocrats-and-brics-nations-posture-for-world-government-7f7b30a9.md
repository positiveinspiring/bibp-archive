Vice President Joe Biden and Senators Harry Reid
and Mitch McConnell, co-authors of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA),
worked through the weekend to
draft a fiscal cliff package to present to Congress Sunday afternoon.
Alternative minimum taxes, keeping unemployment
benefits, cutting Medicare and preservation of tax breaks for the wealthy
are all on the table and will be addressed in the coming draft proposal.
Senator John McCain and Defense Secretary
Leon
Panetta spoke out against the idea of having the defense budget clashed
dramatically; invoking the cost to national security was too great to allow
such a prospect to become reality.
At the last second, with appropriate suspense,
the Senate
passed the proposal to avoid the fiscal cliff. The deal will increase
taxes for incomes earned over $450,000 annually, while purporting to protect
those who take-in less than $250,000 per year.
At the same time as the theater surrounding the
fiscal cliff was brewing, President Obama issued a pay increase to key
members of Capital Hill by
executive
order. Biden has
received a slight increase, as well as Congress, and members of the
Judicial branch of government.
The total amount in pay raises equals $11
billion over the coming decade.
Mainstream media
suggests that going over the fiscal cliff would bring about a deal
between the Congress and Executive branches and force those barring the
compromise to swallow a raw deal.
Coining the catch phrase cliff diving to
describe Obamas stance on the matter brings just the right air of suspense
and loathing to the situation.
Even Senator Lindsey Graham
admitted that,
any time you announce a meeting publicly in Washington,
its usually for political theater purposes.
Coupled with the banter between political
parties and
the Obama administration, the drama is becoming nearly
unbearable - and quite the perfect distraction.
There is still the
under-discussed matter of the debt ceiling, which Obama and Timothy Geithner, Secretary of the US Treasury, affirm
must be raised to infinity.
The automatic cuts to federal spending which would reduce budgets of federal
agencies and stymie the ability of defense and non-defense programs from
their functions are yet to be resolved.
As well, there is lacking in an
overall budget resolution to curb a temporary shutdown of Washington, DC.
In 2010, American International Group (AIG)
explained in a hearing that while Geithner, was head of the New York
Federal Reserve Bank billions of dollars were laundered through AIG and
handed over to specific banks such as,
-
Goldman Sachs
-
Merrill Lynch
-
Societe
Generale
-
Deutsche Bank
While the
$700 billion in bailout money found its way to the Central Bank of China
to pay the nation back for the fraud it encountered after investing in the
mortgage-backed securities, the technocrats rewarded themselves in a secret
money laundering scheme to extract more wealth out of the hands of average
Americans.
At the end of the first term of the Obama
administration the Chinese government began purchasing oil and natural gas
resources worth billions through the China National Offshore Oil Corporation
(which is owned by the Chinese government) and Sinopec Corporation (the
Chinese government
owns the most stock in this corporation).
Obama
offered the Chinese government a third of any new petroleum uncovered in
the Chesapeake Bay. Those deposits are estimated to produce 500,000 thousand
barrels of oil per day.
Sinopec has been promised financial rewards from
profits in states like,
-
Louisiana
-
Texas
-
Michigan
-
Ohio
-
Oklahoma
The fracking endeavors by Niobrara Shale are nearly guaranteed to pay out
financially for CNOOC.
The Obama administration is
pushing for auctions of foreclosed to foreign investors in bulk sales.
The foreclosed properties held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal
Housing Agency (FHA) are of the utmost importance to unload onto foreign
investors. By setting the stage for easy money from foreign investors, Obama
ensures that those investments are given a major return as more properties
are given up for rent rather than resold.
Chinese business owners and possibly government
representatives are
acquiring a large amount of American real estate with $2 billion in
commercial properties in 2011.
China, being part of the BRICs nations, has been
purchasing gold (below video) to back up the yen
while deciding to not accept the US dollar as the global reserve currency.
The Obama administration made investing in
America easier for China.
China was able to buy 35% of any auction of US
Treasury bonds. This was achieved through proxy.
By the intent of Ben
Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank (FED), China may have been
broken financially through inflation brought on by this American central
bank.
The BRICs countries are pushing for a global
gold standard that will alleviate the inflation caused by fiat currency. The
major economies of the world are facing an estimated $7.5 trillion in bond
payments, which is how the central banking cartels keep their Ponzi scheme
afloat.
April of 2012 marked a new direction for the
BRICs countries as they ended their
summit in New Delhi, India with talks of moving away from the US dollar
as the global reserve currency.
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa
are the emerging economies of the world. The G5 countries in counter ignore
their movement toward better trade, ceasing the destruction of our planet
and the end of slavery through debt.
One suggestion placed on the table was to
bailout Europe from the clutches of the central banking system. A BRICs
basket currency was discussed to allow non-aligned countries to trade with
each other without the fears that the central banks and their fiat currency
entail. This would serve as an alternative to the US dollar and the Euro. It
would empower other nations to rise up economically.
The BRICs countries signed an agreement to give
our loans in their respective currencies in a further effort to move away
from the US dollar and Euro.
A joint BRICs bank was discussed with vigor. It
would serve as an alternative to central banks that abuse their power at the
expense of nations worldwide. They hope to replace the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Over 180 countries have signed onto the BRICs
agreement as evidenced in their
declaration.
While the global Elite still hold power over the
G5 countries, the rest of the world is standing up, severing their ties and
making plans for a new world without them.
