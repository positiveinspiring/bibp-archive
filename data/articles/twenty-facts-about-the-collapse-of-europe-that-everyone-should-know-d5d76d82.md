The economic implosion of Europe is
accelerating.
Even while the mainstream media continues to
proclaim that the financial crisis in Europe has been "averted", the
economic statistics that are coming out of Europe just continue to get
worse.
Manufacturing activity in Europe has been
contracting month after month, the unemployment rate in the Eurozone has hit
yet another brand new record high, and the official unemployment rates in
both Greece and Spain are now much higher than the peak unemployment rate in
the United States during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The economic situation in Europe is far worse
than it was a year ago, and it is going to continue to get worse as
austerity continues to take a huge toll on the economies of the Eurozone.
It would be hard to understate how bad things
have gotten - particularly in southern Europe. The truth is that most of
southern Europe is experiencing a full-blown economic depression right now.
Sadly, most Americans are paying very little attention to what is going on
across the Atlantic. But they should be watching, because this is what
happens when nations accumulate too much debt.
The United States has the biggest debt burden of
all, and eventually what is happening over in Spain, France, Italy, Portugal
and Greece is going to happen over here as well.
The following are 20 facts about the collapse of
Europe that everyone should know:
-
10 Months: Manufacturing activity in both France and Germany has
contracted for 10 months in a row.
-
11.8 Percent: The unemployment rate in the Eurozone has now
risen to 11.8 percent - a brand new all-time high.
-
17 Months: In November, Italy experienced the sharpest decline
in retail sales that it had experienced in 17 months.
-
20 Months: Manufacturing activity in Spain has contracted for 20
months in a row.
-
20 Percent: It is estimated that bad loans now make up
approximately 20 percent of all domestic loans in the Greek banking
system at this point.
-
22 Percent: A whopping 22 percent of the entire population of
Ireland lives in jobless households.
-
26 Percent: The unemployment rate in Greece is now 26 percent. A
year ago it was only 18.9 percent.
-
26.6 Percent: The unemployment rate in Spain has risen to an
astounding 26.6 percent.
-
27.0 Percent: The unemployment rate for workers under the age of
25 in Cyprus. Back in 2008, this number was well below 10 percent.
-
28 Percent: Sales of French-made vehicles in November were down
28 percent compared to a year earlier.
-
36 Percent: Today, the poverty rate in Greece is 36 percent.
Back in 2009 it was only about 20 percent.
-
37.1 Percent: The unemployment rate for workers under the age of
25 in Italy - a brand new all-time high.
-
44 Percent: An astounding 44 percent of the entire population of
Bulgaria is facing "severe material deprivation".
-
56.5 Percent: The unemployment rate for workers under the age of
25 in Spain - a brand new all-time high.
-
57.6 Percent: The unemployment rate for workers under the age of
25 in Greece - a brand new all-time high.
-
60 Percent: Citigroup is projecting that there is a 60 percent
probability that Greece will leave the Eurozone within the next 12
to 18 months.
-
70 Percent: It has been reported that some homes in Spain are
being sold at a 70% discount from where they were at during the peak
of the housing bubble back in 2006. At this point there are
approximately 2 million unsold homes in Spain.
-
200 Percent: The debt to GDP ratio in Greece is rapidly
approaching 200 percent.
-
1997: According to the Committee of French Automobile Producers,
2012 was the worst year for the French automobile industry since
1997.
-
2 Million: Back in 2005, the French auto industry produced about
3.5 million vehicles. In 2012, that number dropped to about 2
million vehicles.
One thing that these shocking numbers cannot
convey is the tremendous amount of pain that many average Europeans are
living through on a daily basis at this point.
To get a peek into what life is like in Greece
these days, check out this short excerpt from a recent
Bloomberg article:
Anastasia Karagaitanaki, 57, is a former
model and cafe owner in Thessaloniki, Greece.
After losing her business to the financial
crisis, she now sleeps on a daybed next to the refrigerator in her
mothers kitchen and depends on charity for food and insulin for her
diabetes.
I feel like my life has slipped through
my hands, said Karagaitanaki, whose brother also shares the
one-bedroom apartment. I feel like Im dead.
For thousands of Greeks like Karagaitanaki,
the fabric of middle-class life is unraveling. Teachers, salaries
slashed by a third, are stealing electricity.
Families in once-stable neighborhoods are
afraid to leave their homes because of rising street crime.
All over Europe, people that have lost all hope
are actually setting
themselves on fire in a desperate attempt to draw attention.
Millions of formerly middle class Europeans have
lost everything and are becoming increasingly desperate. Suicide and crime
are skyrocketing all over southern Europe and massive street riots are
erupting on a regular basis.
Unfortunately, this is just the beginning.
Things are going to get even worse for Europe.
Meanwhile, those of us living in the United
States smugly look down our noses at Europe because we are still living in a
false bubble of debt-fueled prosperity.
But eventually we will feel the sting of
austerity as well. The recent
fiscal cliff deal was an indication of that. Taxes are going up and
government spending is at least going to slow down. It won't be too long
before the effects of that are felt in the economy.
And of course the reality of the situation is
that the U.S. economy really did not perform very well at all during 2012
when you take a look at the numbers.
The cold, hard truth is that the U.S. economy
has been declining for a very long time, and there are a whole bunch of
reasons to expect that our decline will accelerate even further
in 2013.
So if you are an American, don't laugh at what
is happening over in Europe at the moment. We are headed down the exact same
path that they have gone, and we are going to experience the same kind of
suffering that they are going through right now.
Use these last few "bubble months" to prepare
for what is ahead.
At some point this "hope bubble" will disappear
and then the time for preparation will be over.
