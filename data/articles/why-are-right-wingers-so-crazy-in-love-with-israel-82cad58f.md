It's much more than
evangelical Christians hoping
for the rapture...!
Ever since word leaked that
Chuck Hagel would be nominated for
Secretary of Defense, Senate Republicans have launched a non-stop attack
against their former colleague from Nebraska.
Its not just neoconservatives. The assault
comes from across the ranks of the GOP. The charge that first dominated
the headlines and is still, in many quarters, the loudest: Hagel is
anti-Israel.
To call the evidence for this charge thin is
an understatement.
In the Senate Hagel
went on record with the same pro-Israel sentiments expected of every
senator:
The United States will remain committed
to defending Israel. Our relationship with Israel is a special and
historic one, he said.
The
L.A. Times notes that he put American money where his mouth was,
voting repeatedly to provide [Israel]
with military aid.
He supported an Israeli-Palestinian peace as
long as it did not compromise Israel's security or its Jewish identity -
a crucial demand for most Israelis.
So what are his alleged anti-Israel
crimes?
-
He suggested that Israel should
negotiate directly with Hamas - which in fact Israel
is already doing, since its obvious that no peace agreement
can endure and keep Israel secure unless Hamas signs on to it.
-
When Hagel affirmed America's
enduring support for Israel, he added that,
In other words, he wants an
even-handed policy that puts American interests first.
-
In an interview Hagel
once said that, as a senator, he did put U.S. interests
first:
"The Jewish lobby intimidates a
lot of people [on Capitol Hill]
I support Israel, but my
first interest is I take an oath of office to the
Constitution of the United States.
The interviewer, the State
Departments long-time (and Jewish) Mideast expert Aaron David
Miller,
said that Hagel was merely stating,
Miller called the attempts to paint
Hagel as anti-Semitic "shameful and scurrilous."
To sum up the charge, Hagel has shown that
when it comes to the Israel-Palestine issue he faces the facts, takes a
reasonable view, and as Secretary of Defense would put his own countrys
interest first.
To his critics, thats simply unacceptable.
Like most supporters of the Israeli government, they treat even the
slightest hint of criticism as if it were a mortal attack on Israel
itself. The slightest deviation from their Israel can do no wrong
agenda evokes howls of condemnation.
Who are these American devotees of
(right-wing) Israel?
Here is the one place Hagel can be faulted.
His widely cited comment about the power of the Jewish lobby suggests
that Jews are to blame for keeping U.S. Mideast policy so blatantly
one-sided all these years. Hagel later apologized, saying that he really
meant the pro-Israel lobby. But the mistaken stereotype persists that
Jews control U.S. Mideast policy.
In fact, what American Jews do is debate
vigorously among themselves about Israel and U.S. policy.
There are multiple Jewish pro-Israel
lobbies promoting quite different views. A spokesman for one of those
lobbies, J. Street,
rightly says that by now,
the center of the community is exactly
where Sen. Hagel is on issues relating to Israel.
And J. Street has
recent polling data to prove it.
Maybe thats one big reason
AIPAC (the
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee), the Anti-Defamation League,
and other old-guard Jewish groups that typically support Israel,
right-wing and wrong, are so far
remaining silent on the Hagel nomination.
Maybe theyre finally recognizing the truth
that
Peter Beinart and so many others are revealing:
Those big-name
organizations are run by aging conservatives who are out of step with
the rest of American Jewry.
Few serious observers credit their claim to
speak for the Jewish community as a whole. As their credibility fades,
so does their political power.
Another sign of the changing times:
Even the
Senates most prominent Jewish pro- (right-wing) Israel hawk, Charles
Schumer, has
announced his support for the Hagel nomination.
Recent polls from
CNN, the
Huffington Post, and Pew
make it clear that, in the U.S., the strongest support for Israels
right-wing policies now comes not from Jews but
from Republicans.
Theyre roughly twice as likely as Democrats
to take Israels side, while Democrats are about five times as likely as
GOPers to sympathize with Palestinians. (About 70 percent of Jews
vote Democratic.)
These polls, taken after Israel attacked
Gaza in November 2012, showed that men, whites and older people (dare we
say, Romney voters?) were most likely to support Israel unreservedly
in the conflict.
Now we know that Republicans will attack an
Obama nominee unreservedly, even when their charges on his Mideast views
are irrational, to say the least. The Republican Party has become the
strongest pro- (right-wing) Israel lobby, demanding 100% blind support
for whatever Israels government does.
Why are Republicans so crazy in love with
Israel?
One common explanation points to a love
triangle:
-
Republicans
-
Israel
-
evangelical Christianity
But after
studying the
interface of religion and politics in America for many
years, Im convinced that the power of religion to shape political life
is usually overrated.
Some evangelical theologies do preach that
Jews must control all of the Holy Land before the second coming of
'Christ.' (The organized Christian Zionist movement is based on
this concept, but as a political group they get little press and have
relatively little clout in Washington.)
However, in the evangelical vision of the
future, the powerful Jewish state is just a passing phase. In the next
phase (to oversimplify a bit) all the Jews become Christians or go to
hell. The New Testament image of Jews as Christ-killers, rejecting and
therefore rejected by the true God, has never been totally erased
either.
So, although white evangelicals are more
likely than other Americans to support Israel, their religion makes them
rather ambivalent toward the Jewish religion, to say the least.
Whats more, conservative evangelicals were
enthusiastic supporters of Israel in the states earliest years, when a
large majority of Israelis were strictly secular and avoided anything
that smacked of religion.
In fact many of those first Israelis were
socialists. Yet American conservatives, evangelical or not, gave full
support to the fledgling Jewish state.
The main reason was not religion, but
politics.
Israel was created in 1948, the very same year that the U.S.
committed itself wholeheartedly to cold war against the "communists.
Israel soon agreed (under strong U.S. pressure, some historians say) to
be the main U.S. ally in the Middle East, where, most Americans believed
(inaccurately), the Arabs were all turning pro-communist.
Israel served U.S. military needs in various
ways, especially as an intelligence-gathering outpost.
When Richard Nixon and
Henry Kissinger formulated their doctrine of appointing
regional policemen to serve U.S. interests around the world, Israel
and the Shahs Iran got the job for the Middle East. With the fall of
the Shah in 1979, Israel was left alone as our cop on the Mideast beat.
But Republican affection for Israel reflects
much more than that nations military usefulness. The deepest root of
the feeling is the symbolic meaning of Israel in the conservative
worldview. The cold war reinforced the conservative penchant for seeing
the world in moral absolutes.
So Israel became the Middle Easts only
good guy, surrounded by a sea of bad guys.
The Israeli government played on this
simplistic dualism with a skillful PR campaign, depicting their nation
as an outpost of civilized American values in a savage Arab wilderness.
To most Americans, it looked like our own
Wild West story all over again:
Brave pioneers turning the desert into a
fertile garden, with a plow in one hand and a gun in the other,
using the gun only when they were forced to defend themselves.
In the Israeli narrative, Jews were always
the victims, constantly on guard against unprovoked attacks - just like
the pioneers of the American Wild West.
The fact that Jews had displaced Arabs, just
as whites displaced Native Americans, often by violent means, simply
wasnt allowed into the story. Nor was the fact that Israels military
strength made its existence
quite secure.
Few Americans questioned the
myth of Israels constant insecurity.
Americans of the Cold War era empathized
with Israel all the more because here in the U.S. we were immersed in
our own
myth of homeland insecurity, constantly on guard against the
imagined threat of communist aggression.
In this way as in so many others Israel
seemed like a miniature America, a partner in the global battle of good
against evil.
Though the Cold War is long gone, that sense
of kinship remains just as strong among conservatives, who still see the
U.S. and Israel as champions of absolute good in a war against the
evildoers. Indeed Israel looks even better now because conservatives
assume that the evildoers plotting to destroy us are the very same
Arab terrorists who are supposedly trying to wipe out Israel.
Conservatives simply ignore the facts. West
Bank Palestinians have shifted almost entirely to
nonviolent
tactics in their struggle against military occupation.
Even in Gaza, Hamas has long
observed a truce, firing rockets only when Israeli attacks provoke
them. And for years Hamas leaders have been supporting a
two-state peace
agreement. But none of this fits the conservatives beloved Wild
West stereotype or their narrative of endless insecurity. So they
mistakenly go on assuming that Israel is constantly under attack by
vicious savages.
The conservative love for Israel has been
strengthened by another mistaken belief: that all Israeli Jews are white
folks.
In fact a sizeable number of Jewish Israelis came from Muslim
lands; they and their descendants have brown skin. But few Americans
know it. Yet all know that Arabs generally have brown skin. No one can
say exactly how strong the racial (and sometimes, no doubt, racist)
factor is in the Republican feeling for Israel. But no one can deny that
its part of the picture.
Conservatives tenuous sense of security
depends on the reassurance they get from believing that theres a
permanent structure in the world, based on permanent dividing lines -
between nations, races, religions, and most importantly, between good
and evil, with their own kind carrying the banner of the good.
As long as they can see good battling evil,
it doesnt matter exactly who the good guys and bad guys are. Its
all essentially a matter of symbolism. So the roles can switch in
surprising ways. (Osama bin Laden was once the darling of the
right-wingers when he fought the communists in Afghanistan.)
Israelis are well aware of how easily
American affections can change.
Their press is full of discussions about the
risk of losing their sole remaining ally.
For now, though, the Republican love for
Israel is holding firm. It has been cemented by the recent shift to the
right among Israeli Jews. Politically, the last few years in Israel have
looked a lot like the Reagan years in the U.S., making it easier for the
GOP to feel that sense of kinship.
Even if Israel moves back toward the center,
its not likely to lose the fervent devotion of Republicans. Theyve
been so convinced for so long that Israel can do no wrong, it hardly
matters to them what Israel does. Its Israel the symbol, not the
reality, that the Republicans love.
Now they are demonstrating their ardor by
acting out a symbolic drama in the Senate, attacking Chuck Hagel on the
flimsiest grounds.
The pro- (right-wing) Israel stance is,
very much a
litmus test for many in the Republican Party, as Washington Post
analyst
Aaron Blake says, and it will make it difficult for any Republican
senator to vote for him.
Like all true lovers, they let their passion
overrule reason.
So theyre taking a political gamble. In the
latest polls, between 39% and 59% of Americans say they support Israel
in its conflict with the Palestinians. (Between 9% and 13% support
Palestine.)
That imbalance might make the Republican
position look safe enough.
But it leaves a huge portion of the
electorate holding no clear preference. How all those undecided voters
respond to this latest display of Republican fanaticism is anyones
guess.
And even among those who back Israel, many
will agree with what Chuck Hagel
has said:
"I'm a supporter of Israel, always have
been. It's in Israel's best interest to get a peace
Peace comes
through dealing with people. Peace doesnt come at the end of a
bayonet or the end of a gun."
The Hagel confirmation hearings should
trigger a public debate, weighing the nominees view against the
Republicans irrational love for Israel, which may serve their own needs
in a perverse way but wreaks such terrible harm on Arabs, Israelis and
the U.S. position in the Middle East.
