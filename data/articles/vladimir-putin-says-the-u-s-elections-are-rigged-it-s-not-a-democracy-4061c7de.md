Is the United States electoral process really democratic?
Every time election year rolls around, millions are encouraged to head to the booths to cast their votes, believing that it actually makes a difference. But does it really? These days, it's hardly unusual to assume that the US elections are rigged. Presidential campaigns have become popularity contests rather than political contests, with each side trying to win over the public through catchy tag lines and controversial statements instead of real intellectual discourse. Indeed, modern day presidents seem to be more like celebrities than real agents of change. That being said, we've still had some strong candidates enter into the process that have touched the hearts of many, and shared important truths with the world. For example, the very popular 2016 candidate Bernie Sanders publicly stated that it doesn't matter who is elected to be president, because,
"that person will not be able to address the enormous problems facing the working families of our countries. They will not be able to succeed because the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street... and campaign donors" is just too great.
And years before him, Theodore Roosevelt stated that,
"presidents are selected, not elected." He also told us that "behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people." (source)

It has become almost commonplace to say that we live in a corporatocracy, not a democracy, and more people are coming to understand that whoever is elected' to be president will have been selected to be there by those who control the seat of the presidency, the financial elite.
There are countless examples of corporations dictating government policy. This leads one to wonder, is the president just a puppet of the financial elite? Does the president have any power at all, or are they just there to bear the brunt of our anger?
In a very informative video, journalist Abby Martin of The Empire Files tells it like it is, explaining that Hillary Clinton is the top pick by big corporations to keep the American empire running.
This isn't a secret; the Clinton's have always kept close company with billionaires, as the recent Wikileaks release of her emails, among other evidence, has made clear.
The Clinton's are closely acquainted with the Rothschilds, and various communications between them were shared in the leaks.
Martin explains how corporations have chosen Hillary to do the real job of any US president,
"be the CEO of the Empire, and they're working hard to keep her on that path to the throne."
Watch the video below:
One of the most important facts for anybody following this campaign to recognize is that the super delegate process has completely destroyed democracy.
There are about 400 pledged delegates divided by primary and caucus results, but there are an additional 700 super delegates, and they can vote against the people's will to ensure nominees are handpicked party insiders.
A single vote from one of these super delegates is worth thousands of the average person. Doesn't seem fair, does it...?
Many of these people are former and current members of Congress, and dozens more are corporate lobbyists for major corporations like Pfizer. More still actually lobby and fundraise for Clinton, though few people are aware of this.
Others are oil lobbyists, representing KeyStone XL, or are paid by Clinton to attract more super delegate votes.
In the video below, Russian President Vladimir Putin rhetorically asks,
"do you really think the United States is a democracy?"
He clearly has no qualms about revealing the truth.
Before you get to the video, here's a quote showing not only how long we have been dealing with this problem, but also how long people have been trying to wake us up to it.
It comes from John F. Hylan, who was the mayor of New York City from 1918-1925.
He has been famously quoted as saying the following:
The real menace of our Republic is the invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities, states and nation... The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both parties... [and] control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country. They use the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government. It operates under cover of a self-created screen [and] seizes our executive officers, legislative bodies, schools, courts, newspapers and every agency created for the public protection.

Fareed Zakaria, as a host on CNN, is known to misquote Putin as well as misrepresent Russia's intentions to the world. At the St Petersburg Economic Forum 2016, Zakaria wasn't going to get away with that very easily... It's important to understand that Trump, unlike Hillary, is the candidate that doesn't call for war with Russia, and that's the extent of Putin's apparent support for Mr. Trump. Similarly, Putin mentions some uncomfortable truths in relation to the not entirely democratic nature of the US Presidential elections.
