A burgeoning global trade agreement with nations
such as Japan, Vietnam and Australia is leaving GMO-labeling advocates
concerned that it could result in a ban on GMO labeling not only in the
U.S., but in all countries taking part in negotiations for the
Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement.
Negotiations for the TPP have been occurring
over the last few years, although under a veil of secrecy that left even
Americas lawmakers out of the process.
Leaked documents have revealed some
specifics, leaving consumer watchdog groups suspicious over a process
intended to streamline labor policies and food labeling guidelines that
would align the U.S. with partnering countries.
Individuals connected to some of the nations
largest corporate interests have been involved in the process, including
former
Monsanto lobbyist Islam Siddiqui, who is the head agricultural negotiator for the TPP on
behalf of the U.S.
Prior to his work as a GMO lobbyist with CropLife, he
worked as the head agricultural trade advisor for
the Clinton
administration.
Countries involved in the TPP include,
-
the U.S.
-
Australia
-
Brunei
-
Chile
-
Canada
-
Malaysia
-
Mexico
-
New Zealand
-
Singapore
-
Vietnam
Countries like Japan, where GMO labeling is
required, could find themselves in a global partnership intended to
eliminate barriers for trade - and separate labeling for Japanese consumers
would be out of the question, according to
NationofChange, a nonprofit news
and advocacy organization.
The labeling of foods containing GMOs
(Genetically Modified Organisms) will not be allowed, writes Barbara
Chicherio in a NationofChange
op-ed.
Japan currently has labeling laws for GMOs in food. Under the
TPP Japan would no longer be able to label GMOs. This situation is the same
for New Zealand and Australia. In the US we are just beginning to see some
progress towards labeling GMOs. Under the TPP GMO labels for US food would
not be allowed.
Vietnam is another nation that has been wary to
latch on to Monsantos growing global influence.
As a nation that was
devastated
by Monsanto-produced,
U.S.-military-delivered
Agent Orange - which
killed or injured an estimated 400,000 and caused another 500,000
instances of birth defects during and after the Vietnam War - its seen as
a touchy subject.
If TPP goes through, laws could override such concerns.
The nations involved in the TPP represent 30
percent of the globes agricultural industry, which would create a steady
market for Monsanto as it seeks to maintain its position as the leading seed
producer in the world, particularly at a time of growing resistance to the
company and GMOs in general.
European nations have already
taken a stand
against Monsanto, with eight countries banning the use of GMO seeds, citing
health concerns and cases in which agricultural workers have been poisoned
by the large quantity of pesticides GMO plants are designed to absorb.
Paul Francois, a 47-year-old French man who
suffered neurological disorders after exposure to Monsanto chemicals, sued
the company - and won.
It is a historic decision insofar as it
is the first time that a pesticide maker is found guilty of such a
poisoning, Francois lawyer
told Reuters.
Its cases like this that have rallied support
within countries where much of the public opposes GMOs - and its cases like
this that are leading Monsanto to hold on to trade agreements that could
give them an edge up in the global market.
The TPP negotiations are expected to wrap up at
some point within 2013.
