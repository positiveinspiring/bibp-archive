The President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini,
has been given evidence that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was
involved in a $1 trillion theft and Fini promises he will bring this up in
the Italian parliament, according to senior Italian sources.
Fini is the leader of a group of
parliamentarians who lost a December 15th (2010) attempt to oust
Berlusconi by 3 votes.
The evidence presented to Fini involves an
attempt by Berlusconi to cash
$1
trillion in Dragon Family bonds that were illegally seized by
Italian Financial police in June of 2009.
According to the evidence Berlusconi and his
allies also tried to buy the Banco Commerciale in Lugano, Switzerland
in order to use it as a depository for stolen assets, the sources say.
The purpose was to place the funds in private
financial trade transactions in order to generate trillions of dollars
without either the Italian government or the governments of the world being
aware, the sources claim.
Finis involvement is expected to put a public spotlight on exactly what
happened after June, 2009 when two Japanese carrying diplomatic passports
were detained and had
$134.5 billion in financial instruments
(with cumulative interest of over $1 trillion) they held seized by Italian
financial police acting on behalf of the
P2 Freemason lodge, the sources claim.
The trail is expected to lead to ultimately to
the
Vatican, the sources say.
