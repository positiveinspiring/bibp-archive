Karen Hudes is a graduate of Yale Law
School and she worked in the legal department of
the World Bank for more than 20 years.
In fact, when she was fired for blowing the
whistle on corruption inside the World Bank, she held the position of Senior
Counsel. She was in a unique position to see exactly how
the
global elite rule the world, and the information that she is now
revealing to the public is absolutely stunning.
According to Hudes, the elite use a very tight
core of financial institutions and mega-corporations to dominate the planet.
The goal is control. They want all of us
enslaved to debt, they want all of our governments enslaved to debt, and
they want all of our politicians addicted to the huge financial
contributions that they funnel into their campaigns.
Since the elite also own all of the big media
companies, the mainstream media never lets us in on the secret that there is
something fundamentally wrong with the way that our system works.
Remember, this is not some "conspiracy theorist"
that is saying these things. This is a Yale-educated attorney that worked
inside the World Bank for more than two decades.
The following summary of her credentials comes directly
from her website...
Karen Hudes studied law at Yale Law School
and economics at the University of Amsterdam. She worked in the US
Export Import Bank of the US from 1980-1985 and in the Legal Department
of the World Bank from 1986-2007.
She established the Non Governmental
Organization Committee of the International Law Section of the American
Bar Association and the Committee on Multilateralism and the
Accountability of International Organizations of the American Branch of
the International Law Association.
Today, Hudes is trying very hard to expose the
corrupt financial system that the global elite are using to control the
wealth of the world.
During
an interview with the New American, she
discussed how we are willingly allowing this group of elitists to totally
dominate the resources of the planet...
A former insider at the World Bank,
ex-Senior Counsel Karen Hudes, says the global financial system is
dominated by a small group of corrupt, power-hungry figures centered
around the privately owned U.S.
Federal Reserve.
The network has seized
control of the media
to cover up its crimes, too, she explained.
In an interview with The
New American, Hudes said that when she tried to blow the whistle on
multiple problems at the World Bank, she was fired for her efforts.
Now, along with a network of fellow
whistleblowers, Hudes is determined to expose and end the corruption.
And she is confident of success.
Citing an
explosive 2011 Swiss study published in
the PLOS ONE journal on "The
Network of Global Corporate Control," Hudes pointed out that a small group of entities - mostly
financial institutions and especially central banks - exert a massive
amount of influence over the international economy from behind the
scenes.
"What is really going on is that the
world's resources are being dominated by this group," she explained,
adding that the "corrupt power grabbers" have managed to dominate
the media as well.
"They're being allowed to do it."
Previously,
I have written about the Swiss study that Hudes mentioned.
It was
conducted by a team of researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Zurich, Switzerland.
They studied the relationships between 37
million companies and investors worldwide, and what they discovered is that
there is a "super-entity" of just 147 very tightly knit mega-corporations
that controls 40
percent of the entire global economy...
When the team further untangled the web of
ownership, it found much of it tracked back to a "super-entity" of 147
even more tightly knit companies - all of their ownership was held by
other members of the super-entity - that controlled 40 per cent of the
total wealth in the network.
"In effect, less than 1 per cent of the
companies were able to control 40 per cent of the entire network,"
says Glattfelder.
Most were financial institutions.
The top 20
included Barclays Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and The Goldman Sachs
Group.
But the global elite don't just control these
mega-corporations.
According to Hudes, they also dominate the
unelected, unaccountable organizations that control the finances of
virtually every nation on the face of the planet. The
World Bank, the IMF
and 'central banks' such as
the Federal Reserve literally control the
creation and the flow of money worldwide.
At the apex of this system is the
Bank for
International Settlements.
It is the central bank of central banks, and
posted below is a video where you can watch Hudes tell Greg Hunter of
USAWatchdog.com the following...
"We don't have to wait for anybody to fire
the Fed or Bank for International Settlements... some states have
already started to recognize silver and gold, the precious metals, as
currency"
Most people have never even heard of the
Bank for International
Settlements, but it is an extremely important
organization.
In a
previous article, I described how this "central bank of the world" is
literally immune to the laws of all national governments...
An immensely powerful international
organization that most people have never even heard of secretly controls
the money supply of the entire globe. It is called the Bank for
International Settlements, and it is the central bank of central banks.
It is located in Basel, Switzerland, but it
also has branches in Hong Kong and Mexico City. It is essentially an
unelected, unaccountable central bank of the world that has complete
immunity from taxation and from national laws.
Even Wikipedia admits that "it
is not accountable to any single national government."
The Bank for International Settlements was
used to launder money for the Nazis during World War II, but these days
the main purpose of the BIS is to guide and direct the centrally-planned
global financial system.
Today, 58 global central banks belong to the
BIS, and it has far more power over how the U.S. economy (or any other
economy for that matter) will perform over the course of the next year
than any politician does.
Every two months, the central bankers of the
world gather in Basel for another "Global Economy Meeting".
During those meetings, decisions are made
which affect every man, woman and child on the planet, and yet none of
us have any say in what goes on.
The Bank for International Settlements is an
organization that was founded by the global elite and it operates for
the benefit of the global elite, and it is intended to be one of the key
cornerstones of the emerging one world economic system.
This system did not come into being by
accident.
In fact, the global elite have been developing
this system for a very long time.
In a previous article entitled "Who
Runs The World? - Solid Proof That a Core Group of Wealthy Elitists is Pulling
The Strings", I included a quote from Georgetown University history
professor Carroll Quigley from a book that he authored all the way
back in 1966 (Tragedy
and Hope) in which he discussed the big plans that the elite had for the
Bank for International Settlements...
[T]he powers of financial capitalism had
another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of
financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system
of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.
This system was to be controlled in a
feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert,
by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and
conferences.
The apex of the system was to be the Bank
for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank
owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves
private corporations.
And that is exactly what we have today.
We have a system of "neo-feudalism" in which all
of us and our national governments are
enslaved to debt. This system is governed by the central banks and by
the Bank for International Settlements, and it systematically transfers the
wealth of the world out of our hands and into the hands of the global elite.
But most people have no idea that any of this is
happening because the global elite also control what we see, hear and think
about.
Today, there are
just six giant media corporations that control more than 90 percent of
the news and entertainment that you watch on your television in the United
States.
This is the insidious system that Karen Hudes is
seeking to expose.
