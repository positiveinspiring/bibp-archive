DARPA is sick and tired of waiting around for
Mother Nature.
Instead, it wants to take the life-making
business into its own hands - and manufacture new biological forms in a
factory of mix-and-match bio-bits. A
recent call for research by the Pentagons mad science agency proposes a
new program called Living Foundries.
The idea is to use biology as a manufacturing
platform to,
enable on-demand production of new and
high-value materials, devices and capabilities.
In other words, lets engineer life to make
stuff we want.
The fields of bioengineering and synthetic
biology have already produced some useful, scary and flat-out bizarre
entities. Besides renewable petroleum or
steel strong
spider silk, there are all sorts of potential
therapeutic, industrial and
agricultural purposes for reorganized DNA.
But DARPA thinks progress is too slow. Previous
projects (it calls them primitive) are ad hoc and labor intensive,
chugging along by trial and error in secretive silos.
Hence we are,
limited to producing only a small fraction
of the vast number of possible chemicals, materials and living systems
that would be enabled by the ability to truly engineer biology.
To jumpstart the process, DARPA wants to open
the playing field to people from outside the biological sciences, recruiting
designers, engineers, manufacturers, computer scientists, academics and
anyone else who has an idea.
By democratizing the biological design and
manufacturing process, they hope to speed up the development of a reliable
factory for all sorts of kind-of-living things.
One of the specifics theyre looking for?
Modular genetic parts. Kind of like Legos for biology, a standardized system
of bio-units capable of being assembled in any which way would explode the
possibilities for producing new materials and systems.
Something like this already exists - the
Registry of Standard Biological
Parts lists thousands of BioBricks,
or DNA modules that control everything from breaking down chemicals to
killing off cells.
Expanding this open source Williams-Sonoma
catalog of synthetic biology could lead to creations weve only ever
dreamed of.
DARPA is also looking for design tools to map
out individual projects, cell-like systems and chassis to use as templates,
new test platforms and DNA-assembly techniques, and methods for fine-tuning
and debugging.
Basically, they want a space for biological
innovation limited only by the creativity of the designer. And designers
have been known to get pretty
creative, so who knows what they could do with DARPA money.
I guess well see soon enough - they, along with
all other brave souls, have until June 21 to submit an idea.
