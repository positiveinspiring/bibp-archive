College education in the United States has
become a cruel joke.
We endlessly push our high school kids to invest
tens of thousands of dollars and at least four years of their lives to get a
college education because they wont have any sort of a "future" without it.
So they sign up for decades of debt slavery and spend years listening to
pompous windbags fill their heads with utter nonsense.
The sad truth is that most college courses are a
total joke and they do very little to actually prepare those students for
the real world. I know I attended public universities in the United States
for eight years.
Most college courses are so easy that the family
dog could pass them. When they finally graduate, our young people discover
that they were lied to all along.
The promised "good jobs" are not there for most
of them, but the huge debts that they committed themselves to will follow
them around permanently. When you are just starting out and you are not
making a lot of money, having to make payments on tens of thousands of
dollars of student loan debt can be absolutely crippling.
This is why I say that college education in
America is a giant money making scam.
Our young people are seduced by the idea of
college being a five year party that will provide an automatic ticket into
the middle class, but the reality is that the only guarantee is that it is a
ticket to serfdom unless you have wealthy parents that are willing to foot
the bill for you.
And bankruptcy laws have been changed to make it
incredibly difficult to get rid of student loan debt, so once you have
signed up for student loan debt slavery you are basically faced with two
choices: either you are going to pay it or you are going to die with it.
Yes, college graduates do make more money and
they do have a lower unemployment rate. But most of them are also burdened
by absolutely suffocating levels of student loan debt that will haunt them
for decades.
So who is really better off?
If you can get someone to pay for your college
education that is great. Because otherwise you are probably getting a rotten
deal.

When you are overwhelmed by nightmarish student
loan debt that you can never get away from, it can literally take over your
life.
A recent
Businessweek article shared some real life examples of this
If student loans are good debt, how do you
account for the reaction of Christina Mills, 30, of Minneapolis, when
she found out her payment on college and law school loans would be
$1,400 a month?
"I just went into the car and started
sobbing," says Mills, who works for a nonprofit. "It was more than
my paycheck at the time."
Medical student Thomas Smith, 25, of
Hamilton, N.J., is $310,000 in debt and is struggling to make ends meet
even before beginning to repay his loans.
"I dont even know what I eat," he says.
"I just go to the supermarket and buy the cheapest thing I can and
buy as much of it as I can."
Then theres Michael DiPietro, 25, of
Brooklyn, who accumulated about $100,000 in debt while getting a
bachelors degree in fashion, sculpture, and performance, and spent the
next two years waiting tables.
He has since landed a fundraising job in the
arts but still has no idea how he will pay back all that money.
"Ive come to the conclusion that its
an obsolete idea that a college education is like your golden
ticket," DiPietro says.
What about you...?
