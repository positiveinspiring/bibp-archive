# Clinton Cash

Nagging questions persist regarding
the trustworthiness of Democratic presidential candidate
Hillary
Clinton.
At the center of this debate are her
finances, and the inner workings of the popular Clinton
Foundation she co-founded with her husband, former President
Bill Clinton.
-
Has the enormous success of
the world-renowned philanthropic organization fattened
the wallets of this political power couple?
-
Have foreign governments
been given special privileges that are commensurate with
the magnitude of their donations?
Coinciding with the release of the
hotly anticipated expose of the same name by author Peter
Schweizer, the new documentary 'Clinton Cash' couldn't be timelier
in the heat of this tumultuous election season, and its
revelations are certain to rile voters from both sides of the
aisle.
Wherever the Clintons go, controversy ensues.
The film contends that their
improprieties begin with the questionable associations they
keep. Such is the case in the Republic of Congo, a devastated
region riddled with widespread human rights catastrophes.
According to the information contained in the film, the
foundation received $100 million dollars from that country's
dictator - Mobutu Sese Seko.
Following this generous donation,
then Secretary of State Clinton ended her public pleas for
freedom and democracy in the region.
The filmmakers detail similarly
shady incidents in the foundation's dealings with Nigeria,
Africa, Haiti and other ravaged regions of the world.
Also included in the discussion are Bill Clinton's astronomical
speaking fees, possible political favors that have transpired in
the wake of sizeable donations, charitable outreach efforts that
may have doubled for "pay and play" deals, and the couple's
mounting personal fortunes in the years since they first left
the Oval Office.
In each instance, the film charges
that these curious dealings and a significant lack of
transparency speak to a larger cover-up of global proportions.
-
Is Clinton Cash an honest
examination of corruption at the highest level?
-
Or is it merely one
component of a baseless, unsubstantiated smear campaign
meant to derail her current race to the White House?
Avid supporters of Clinton are
unlikely to be swayed by the barrage of accusations presented in
the film, but it may provide a convincing argument for those who
remain on the fence this election cycle.
