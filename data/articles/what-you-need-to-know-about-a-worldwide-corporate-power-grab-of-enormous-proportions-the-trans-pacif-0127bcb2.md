# What You Need to Know About a Worldwide Corporate Power Grab of Enormous 
Proportions - The Trans Pacific Partnership

As international trade negotiators
gathered this week at a posh golf resort in rural Virginia to
hammer out details of the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP),
they sought to project an image of inclusion and receptivity to
public input.
In reality, this high-stakes global
corporate pact, now in its 14th round of discussions,
is heavily guarded by paramilitary teams with machine guns and
helicopters as it is developed behind closed doors under a
dangerous and unprecedented veil of secrecy.
What the hell is the TPP,
you may ask?
While it is among the largest and
potentially most important free trade agreements the world has
ever seen, one can hardly be blamed for not being familiar with
it yet.
The corporate cabal behind it,
including names like,
...has done an exceptional job of
maintaining an almost total lack of transparency as they
literally design the future we will all inhabit.
While 600 corporate lobbyists have
been granted access and input on the draft texts from the
beginning, even
high-ranking members of Congress have been denied access to
the most basic content of what US negotiators are proposing in
our names.
Thankfully, draft texts of the
proposal have appeared on Wikileaks and the website
of Citizens Trade Campaign. It is difficult to overstate
the potential implications on the lives of people around the
world if anything like the agreement in these leaked documents
were to be implemented with the force of law.
The TPP is called a trade
agreement, but in actuality it is a long-dreamed-of template
for implementing a binding system of global corporate
governance as bold as anything the worlds wealthiest elite
has attempted before.
Of the 26 chapters under
negotiation, only a few have to do directly with trade.
The
other chapters enshrine new rights and privileges for major
corporations while weakening the power of nation states to
oppose them. The TPP essentially proposes to establish a
parallel system of justice where companies can sue countries
in a tribunal of judges composed of unaccountable international
trade lawyers with little to no process for appeal.
This wild bastardization of the
concept of justice endangers everything from affordable
medicines, internet freedoms and intellectual property rights to
democratically enacted labor laws and environmental protections.
And thats not to mention the massive outsourcing of middle
class jobs from the US to countries like Vietnam and Brunei.
This isnt just a bad trade
agreement, its a wish list of the 1% - a worldwide corporate
power grab of enormous proportions.
This week, in an empty warehouse on
the outskirts of downtown Baltimore, a group of activists from
around the US gathered to plan a spirited week of resistance to
the TPP. Finally, after three years of secret negotiations, the
momentum of an opposition movement is building.
On Sunday, a
diverse and raucous crowd of a couple hundred people descended
on this exclusive golf resort to demand their voices be heard,
chanting after each speaker:
Flush the TPP!
NAFTA was the last straw that sent
the Zapatistas into armed rebellion.
The WTO negotiations spawned a
robust and global anti-globalization movement the likes of which
the world had never seen. Even after 9/11, the FTAA elicited a
pushback of people power that even a fully militarized Miami
police force could not completely suppress.
But near as I can tell, even though
the TPP is bigger, bolder and badder than any trade agreement
before it, the small group gathered this week on a grassy
hillside in rural Virginia is the backbone of resistance to the
TPP today.
The elements are there:
-
a diverse coalition of wonky
NGOs
-
social justice and trade
policy experts
-
urban anarchists
-
Occupiers and suburban
activists painting banners and scheming pranks-labor
leaders
-
environmental groups and
representatives from Mexico, Peru and beyond,
...but the scale is so far totally
out of proportion to the threat were facing.
But this is beginning to change.
Speakers at Sundays rally included
key labor leaders from the Teamsters, and the Communications
Workers of America joined with the leaders of 'environmental
groups' from the
Sierra Club,
Friends of the Earth and
Rainforest Action Network.
The TPP was conceived under the
second
Bush
administration, but it has been embraced and nurtured
into maturity under Obamas watch.
The widespread belief among people
here opposing it is that the current Administration is in a race
to finish much of the negotiations while they can bank on the
fact that labor leaders and environmental and human rights
advocates will shy away from challenging a democratic president
in an election year.
Free trade agreements are
particularly unpopular in the key swing states Obama needs to
win this election - making right now a crucial moment of
opportunity to pull the TPP out of the shadows and leverage our
combined political power to kill it before it takes root any
deeper.
Stay tuned, one way or another
history will be made in the coming months and the outcome will
forever influence how our communities and countries relate to
each other in an ever-shrinking world.
