Chapter Eight
CIA, Governmental and Scholarship programming
Some systems will have internal CIA programming. Some of the methods
mentioned in earlier chapters, such as brain wave programming and color
coding were developed in part through funding by the CIA in the 1950's
and 1960's. Military intelligence officers working in Langley, Virginia,
used these government funds to conduct research on human subjects. They
reported what they were learning to trainers throughout the U.S. and
Europe.
CIA programming can include having alters in a system trained in different
techniques of both finding a target, and studying the target without
being detected. The end result of tagging the victim can include having
a sexual assignation with the target, or may involve having people inside
trained to assassinate a target.
These are complex programming sequences, and are put in over years
of training, with periodic reinforcement. Alters may be trained to become
hyper aware of their environment, and able to overhear conversations
that are whispered. Internal recorders are taught to download these
conversations, as well as other info. Photographic recall is emphasized,
as the person will be hypnotized or put into a delta state for "downloading"
information to the trainer or CIA operative.
The survivor with CIA programming will have been taught extensively
how to "drop a tag" (detect anyone following them, and ditch
them). This training will be begun in early childhood and built upon
as the child grows older. They will often be taken into a neutral colored
training room. They may be drugged, or hypnotized, usually a combination
of both.
They will be shown training films of how a CIA operative works. They
will be told that they are "special", "chosen",
"one in a thousand" who is the only one who can do this special
work. They are told that they get to be a secret agent for the CIA.
The young child, having no idea who the CIA is, focuses on the fact
that they have been chosen because they are special, needed, and will
be eager to please. The child will be taken to a dinner party, or a
drama set up by the trainer. There will be a group, anywhere from ten
to sixteen people at the "party". Afterwards, the child will
be questioned by the trainer extensively. Who was sitting where? What
were they wearing? What color were their eyes? Their hair? Who gave
the speech? What did they say? The child will be praised for correct
answers, but punished, shocked if unable to recall details. This is
to reinforce natural photographic memory, and assist the child with
recording details. The next few times, the child's abilities will improve,
as it wants to avoid punishment.
In the next level of training the child will be asked to observe, and
figure out: who is the most important person in the room? Why? They
will be taught body movements, and mannerisms, that give nonverbal clues
away. The child may be taught to approach important adults, or an assigned
target, first in role play, later in real life, and engage them in innocuous
conversation while looking for information they have been clued to get.
They may be taught to be innocently seductive, and will be dressed for
the part. They will frequently be taught to lure the target into having
intercourse with them.
An older youth, or adult, will also be taught not only how to lure
a target into bed, but later how to kill them, if they are an assassination
target, while they are asleep or relaxing after sexual relations. They
will be taught to go through the target's belongings for any information
needed by the trainer or cult leader. Often, before an assignment for
an assassination, the cult member will be indoctrinated with reasons
why killing the victim is a service to humanity. They will be lied to
and told that they are the head of a porno ring, a pedophile, or a brutal
villain. This will engage the assassin's natural anger towards the person,
and will motivate them, while helping to overcome their natural moral
reluctance and guilt at killing a human being.
They will be taught how to disguise themselves, with change of clothing,
sex (masquerading as the opposite sex), makeup, contact lenses, and
get out of the situation safely. They will be taught how to overcome
interrogation techniques with extensive training and hypnosis, in case
they are ever caught. They will be taught to self suicide with a pill
or dagger, if they are ever apprehended, in most cases.
Suggestions:
CIA programming will involve the use of sophisticated technology to
reinforce its effectiveness, and can be difficult to break. It may involve
the person being traumatized in isolation tanks (this will also be done
with brain wave programming). It may involve sensory deprivation, sensory
overload, isolation, sleep deprivation. It may involve hours of listening
to repetitive tapes on headphones. The subject is shocked, or severely
punished, if they try to remove the headphones. They will be hypnotized,
tortured; subjected to different drug combinations; they will be exposed
to harmonic tones, often in one ear or the other. They will be exposed
to flashing strobe lights,
which may induce a seizure, and alters will be programmed to cause seizures
if the subject tries to break programming. They will be shown high speed
films with different tracks, one for the left eye and one for the right
eye, to increase brain splitting or dichotomous thinking.
The survivor and therapist need to work slowly to undo the effects
of this trauma. The person will need to come to terms, slowly, and carefully,
with how the programming was done. They may need to learn their own
access codes (this will also be true of brain wave, and other sophisticated
programming techniques). They will need to communicate with the traumatized
alters and fragments inside, let them know they were used. They will
need to help the young alters, who were split to create the system,
and often underwent the worst traumas. Grieving for the abuse, the trauma,
the methodical calculation used and scientific methods used to put in
this programming, will take time. Venting feelings, including rage,
safely will be important. The survivor may be afraid of strong feelings
and will fear especially anger and rage, since they will associate those
feelings with having to kill, hurt, or assassinate others. Allowing
the feelings to be expressed slowly and carefully, being aware that
homicidal and suicidal feelings will probably come up, is important.
If there is a concern about the ability to control acting out, the
client may need to go inpatient in a safe facility that understands
mind control and cult programming. They will fear being labeled "psychotic"
since the programmers told them that they would be called this, and
locked up forever. The WORST thing a therapist or hospital can do in
a situation like this, is play into those fears, or label the person
psychotic. Constant grounding in reality, using grounding exercises;
slow, careful venting of rage and betrayal feelings; reinforcing over
and over that the survivor can remember, and NOT go psychotic, or die,
BELIEVING and VALIDATING the survivor, are all important. The survivor
may have unstable behavior at points, but this is not psychosis, but
rather, the natural reaction to extreme trauma. The survivor needs to
realize this, and that they can overcome its effects, with time and
good therapy. They will need hope, and a good support system.
Governmental Programming:
Governmental programming will involve the person being trained to take
leadership positions or administrative positions in the government.
They may be trained to network with others in governments, both local
, national, and international. The Illuminati's stated goal is to infiltrate,
and eventually cause the downfall of, all major governments in the world.
Government operatives are taught to do this by: infiltrating local political
parties running for leadership both locally and nationally working for
top leaders, as administrators, financial advisors funding governmental
races and backing the person sympathetic to the
Illuminati, or putting their person in to win, creating political chaos
and unrest with operatives trained in dissension. The people selected
for governmental programming are usually highly intelligent with native
charm, or charisma. They are also skilled people manipulators. These
abilities may be enhanced through programming, encouraging the person
to project a "persona" that will draw people to them.
They are also taught finances extensively. This programming is done
by: hypnotizing the person, whether child, youth, or adult (it is usually
initiated in late childhood in suitable candidates), and inducing deep
trance with drugs. The person is shocked, then told the trainer's and
cult agenda for the person. They are told that they are very special
to the Illuminati, and will be one of the people who helps change world
history. They are told they will be rewarded with wealth, popularity
and power for achieving the cult's agenda. They are told, and shown,
what the punishment for disobedience is. They are shown training films
about government, how it works, national and international affairs.
They will meet with special teachers, who coach them on the inner political
workings of the group they want to infiltrate, including the power structure
and strengths and weaknesses of key players.
They will learn any languages necessary for the position. They will
go to University, or get any training and education needed for credibility.
They will receive special scholarships to finance this, if needed. They
are given opportunities to practice their skills at infiltration, information
gathering, people manipulation, and politics in set ups, and later in
real situations. If they need to learn to control the media, they will
learn methods to do this. They will have extensive back up and coaching
during their entire career.
Suggestions:
Governmental programming is quite complex, since it ties in with the
person's natural abilities. They may not be able to separate themselves
easily from the role that they perform and often will only feel that
they are acceptable when they do their job. They may find it difficult
to believe that their career, friendships, marriage and contacts have
been secretly guided by the cult for most of their life. These parts
may feel offended, betrayed, or furious when this realization hits.
They will also find it difficult not to use the manipulation skills
that come so naturally, both on their therapist, and themselves, to
dull the pain that the truth may bring. The person and the alters that
have undergone this type of programming have a lot to lose if they give
up their roles and persona, and need to count the cost of getting out
and acknowledge the difficulty of doing so. They will need to grieve
over being used, and for the false interpretation of reality they have
believed all their lives. Listening to other parts inside and acknowledging
the reality of the cult abuse will be important steps in breaking free.
Success in a new career in the person's daily life will also help restore
a broken self image.
Scholarship training:
The Illuminati revere scholarship, especially oral tradition. Children
with good memories and native intelligence may undergo specific training
in the area of scholarship. This will include learning under trauma,
with praise for accomplishment. It will also mean punishment or being
shocked for poor performance. Some of the major areas of scholarship
include, but are not limited to:
Oral tradition: history of the Illuminati, especially the child's particular
branch, memorizing genealogies. Learning and becoming fluent in multiple
languages, both modern and ancient, including but not limited to: English,
French, German, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Egyptian
hieroglyphics; ancient Babylonian, ancient Chaldean and cuneiform writings.
Some revered ancient texts are written in very ancient languages, and
certain ceremonies may include rituals which utilize them. Learning
ancient and modern history and becoming adept at planning role plays
and dramatizations. Learning to teach others the above skills. The child
who becomes adept at scholarship will also be expected to become a skilled
teacher, and in turn, pass their knowledge down to others. They will
practice teaching in both classroom and individual sessions.
Suggestions:
Scholarship programming will involve alters who are intensely loyal
to the cult, since they believe they are related to a long, unbroken
line of people since earliest history. They will often be immersed in
cult philosophy, having read and memorized numerous esoteric volumes
related to it. Appealing to logic, intellect, having an open mind and
discussing the pros and cons of leaving the cult with them will often
be received the best. They despise open conflict, and prefer addressing
issues intellectually. They will be skilled debaters, and quite verbal.
Asking them to read books that address becoming free from the cult,
and asking them to sit in and listen to accounts from traumatized alters
both in their system and others inside, will often
help them make the decision to switch loyalties. Although they will
have been immersed in false ideologies and doctrines, they are frequently
willing to attempt to be intellectually honest. They will read and debate
both sides of an issue, and may become some of the first to make the
decision to leave the cult once convinced that it is abusive.
