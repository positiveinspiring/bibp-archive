Kissinger McLarty Associates
I have tried to ensure that all the information presented below is correct.
Much is written about Kissinger Associates, and not all of it can be proven. All of the sources given are corporate, governmental or from reliable media sources. If you find any errors, or indeed have more to contribute, please don’t hesitate to contact me. – JohnHorneUK@aol.com - otherwise, I hope this proves useful.
John Horne
***NEW*** Henry Kissinger has recently been appointed to head the 9-11 Commission. Everything else considered (like Kissinger being a war criminal & all) there is the serious question of his conflicts of interest. Take for example this exchange on CNN’s Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer:
BLITZER: Let me
then move on to a Los Angeles Times editorial which came up with a different
criticism of you, and I'll put that up on the screen as well. It says, "His
company, Kissinger Associates, is known for introducing U.S. firms looking for
business overseas to leaders of foreign governments. The company has not
disclosed all of its clients or detailed the work it does. There is the
possibility of a conflict of interest in investigating foreign governments that
can be beneficial to clients." What about that point, that your company,
Kissinger Associates, does not disclose its clients and there could be
potentially a conflict of interest?
KISSINGER: No law firm discloses its clients. I will discuss my clients fully with the counsel of the White House and with the appropriate ethics groups. And the possibility that the investigation of a commission that contains eight commissioners would be affected by any conceived commercial interests is outrageous. I have served six presidents, and I have never been accused of anything of this kind.

Before you go any further, I will direct you to the
company's
own site, which will explain why this site is necessary:
Have you ever seen a company so bereft of information? All of
the main sites for dispersing information about companies go dry when it comes
to Kissinger Associates – believe me, I’ve been through them all. The best I
mustered was this from Hoovers:
Kissinger Associates, Inc.
350 Park Avenue
New York, NY 10022
(212) 759-7919
From that I did manage to compile a list of
companies who share the same building as Henry.
In short, very little is known about this “International
Consulting Firm” other than a few press releases, or information culled from
other companies and corporate reports. I have no idea whose the firm has as
clients and have little idea of who works there. What follows is all I can find
about the company.
First, a small description, provided by David Rockefeller’s
“Council of the Americas”, of
which Kissinger Associates is a member:
“Kissinger Associates and
its affiliate, Kissinger McLarty Associates, provide strategic advisory and
advocacy services to a select group of U.S. and multinational companies. The
firms provide high-level intervention regarding special projects, assist their
clients to identify strategic partners and investment opportunities, and advise
clients on government relations throughout the world. KAI was founded in 1982 by
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. In 1999, former Clinton Chief of
Staff and Special Envoy for the Americas Thomas F. McLarty joined KAI as
Vice-Chairman, and established a Washington office of KAI known as Kissinger
McLarty Associates (KMA). The firm
does not, however, lobby the United States government or engage in conduct that
would require us to register as foreign agents under US law, nor do we accept
fees from foreign governments.” (source)
Since June 2001, we can also add Bill
Richardson to the dynamic duo as he became a senior managing director
following a three year tenure as U.S. Secretary of Energy.
Writing for the New York Times Magazine on April
20th, 1986, Leslie Gelb gave a small insight into the company: “[in]
25 to 30 corporations paid KA between $150,000 and $420,000 each per annum for
political influence and access. […] The superstar international consultants [at
KA] were certainly people who would get their telephone calls returned from high
American government officials and who would also be able to get executives in to
see foreign leaders.”
Back in 1989 it had five partners: Kissinger,
Brent
Scowcroft, Lawrence
Eagleburger, Alan Stoga, T. Jefferson Cunningham III. Power elite, each and
every one. We know this in part because of documents that were subpeonad by the
Committee on Foreign Relations in 1991, relating to the BCCI scandal.
For a comprehensive synopsis of Kissinger Associates and BCCI
see here.
(or here for the
entire report)
Kissinger Associates was also involved in the Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro (BNL) scandal (also known as `Iraqgate’) which can pretty much be
seen as another tentacle of the same illegal octopus. This scandal was
particularly at the heart of Kissinger Associates because of the more intimate
nature of the dealings that Kissinger, Scowcroft, Eagleburger and William Rogers
had with the various companies and entities involved – not least because BNL
hired Kissinger Associates. This scandal is perticularly pertinent given the
current warmongering climate which seeks to launch an all out offensive in Iraq
– these were the guys who armed the country in the first place. The best online
information on this scandal comes from Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (who died in 1998)
in a series of presentations given to the House of Representatives in
1991-2.
The key testimonies relating to Kissinger Associates: April
24th 1991, April
25th 1991, May
2nd 1991, April
28th 1992 (for the
rest: 1991, 1992)
Some of the information in the April
25th 1991 hearing may still be relevant. This concerns Volvo and
its then CEO Pehr Gyllenhammar. I have confirmed that up until 1997 he was still
a director of Kissinger Associates and it is quite possible that that
relationship still exists.
The investigation was
stonewalled from the highest corridors of power, especially because the
scandal went straight into the heart of the Bush Administration. Indeed, it
would appear that much of the key
evidence was shredded by the Department of Justice. In two speeches given in
July (1
2)
Gonzalez explains the explicit foreknowledge that the USG had of US corporate
interest in arming Iraq – the poiniant fact being therefore that Kissinger,
Scowcroft et al operated under a blanket of protection. Only time will tell what
Kissinger Associates have been doing in the past ten years – but the addition of
McLarty is ominous. If the Republicans help their own you can be sure that
Democrats will do similar.
Back then, Lloyd
Cutler, was (and may still be) the attourney for the company. He was also
Presidential Counsel to Carter and Clinton. Fickle – maybe – but I rest my
case.
We also know that companies who have used (& may way
still use) the services of Kissinger Associates include:
American
Express – Kissinger sits on the International Advisory Board
Arco (aka Atlantic
Richfield)
ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB)
the Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro – see above for info on the BNL scandal
Forstmann Little
& Co – of which Kissinger is a Director
Freeport McMoRan –
Kissinger is now a `Director Emeritus’ of the company earning himself
personally $400,000 in 1994.
JP Morgan Chase –
Kissinger also sits on its International Advisory Board
Shearson Lehman Hutton
Union Carbide –
now merged with Dow Chemical Company – Union Carbide is the company responsible
for the Bhopal disaster. Much more info on this here.

Hitchens The Trial of Henry Kissinger (Verso, 2002) p.121-126; Walter
Isaacson Kissinger:
A Biography p.733-734;
also Reuters
release 5/31/02)
Indeed, the small chapter in Christopher Hitchens book The
Trial of Henry Kissinger just hints at the utterly power centric and
compassionless nature of Kissinger Associates. An excerpt from the book,
predeminately focussing on Kissingers role with Freeport McMoRan (but also his
business interests in Iraq) can be found here.
The company has also met the wrath of Larry Klayman of
Judicial Watch:
“The firm of Kissinger,
McLarty & Richardson epitomizes Washington, D.C. at its worst – sleazy
ex-administration officials, feeding off special influence and power and then
pretending, with the help of their enablers, to be fine, upstanding and
respected gentlemen. Judicial Watch will `watch’ closely their activities and
take action whenever warranted. Today, we will be filing Freedom of Information
Act requests to learn about their activities in the recent past,” stated
Judicial Watch Chairman and General Counsel Larry Klayman. (source)
This announcement was made
in June 2001 – sadly there is no update of yet.
Kissinger McLarty Associates has a “strategic alliance” with
the Blackstone Group – seen by many as
nothing more than another arm of the Carlyle Group. The Blackstone Group
describes their relationship thus:
“Blackstone's alliance with Kissinger McLarty Associates is
designed to help provide financial advisory services to corporations seeking
high-level strategic advice. The relationship was announced in 2000 and recently
completed its first strategic advisory assignment on behalf of a NYSE-listed
company.” (source)
Infact the alliance also incorporates Maurice Greenberg’s American International Group, as per this press
release on February 21st 2000:
“American International Group, Inc. (AIG), The Blackstone
Group L. P. and Kissinger Associates Inc. announced the establishment of a new
venture to provide financial advisory services to corporations seeking
high-level independent strategic advice. […] The venture will operate globally
and will take advantage of the existing relationships between the partners:
- AIG has an ownership
interest in Blackstone and is an investor in several of Blackstone's private
equity funds;
- AIG and Blackstone have a
joint venture, specializing in restructuring and M&A advisory services in
selected Asian countries;
- Henry Kissinger chairs
both AIG's International Advisory Board and the advisory boards of several
AIG-sponsored Infrastructure Funds.
The AIG-Blackstone-Kissinger
Associates venture recently completed its first advisory assignment on behalf of
a New York Stock Exchange listed U.S. company.” (source)
(note: “M&A” means “Mergers and Acquisitions”)
Indeed: “In
1998, American International Group ("AIG") acquired a 7% non-voting interest in
The Blackstone Group for $150 million and committed to invest $1.2 billion in
future Blackstone-sponsored funds.” (source) And Maurice
Greenberg sits on Blackstone’s Domestic Advisory
Board.
In
1999 Kissinger Associates signed on SGV
& Co “Asia's largest accounting and consulting firm” to “further expand
its reach”. On June
6th 2002 SGV became an affiliate of Ernst & Young – prior to
that it was “a member firm of Arthur Andersen”
Kissinger McLarty has also worked / still works with Princeton Video Image to aid its expansion
into Latin America:
“Eduardo Sitt, Director of
Presencia en Medios and member of Princeton Video Image's Board of Directors,
said, "Publicidad Virtual has demonstrated to Latin America that Princeton Video
Image's technology is a viable
means to generate revenue and gross profit dollars through virtual advertising,
and we have just scratched the surface. We are taking our successful experience
in Mexico and expanding into Latin America's other key markets. To help us in
these efforts, we have retained the services of Kissinger McLarty
Associates, whose strategic expertise will help us in our expansion.” –
15th December 2000 (source)
And provides/d similar services
for GlobalNet:
“GlobalNet, Inc., a fast
growing telecommunications firm, today announced it has retained the strategic
consulting firm of Kissinger McLarty Associates to help execute its further
expansion into Latin America. GlobalNet currently provides customers in the
United States and Latin America with high-quality voice, fax, and other
value-added services through its growing internet-protocol based network. Bob
Donahue, GlobalNet CEO, said, "as we quickly continue to build our network and
customer base in Latin America, Kissinger McLarty Associates, with its political
savvy and contacts, will help us establish relationships and avoid pitfalls as
we enter new markets.''” - 31st July 2000 (source)
“GlobalNet is leveraging its
partnership model to expand into new areas of Latin America. It recently has
contracted with the strategic consulting firm of Kissinger McLarty Associates to
help establish alliances in new markets.” – January 2001 (source)
There was also some speculation of a deal with Excite:
“Kissinger McLarty
Associates […] has approached Excite@Home about buying a majority stake in the
company, The Wall St. Journal reports. The firm has been in discussions with
Excite@Home since May, according to the report.” - August 29, 2001 (source)
Another company is Prescott Enterprises (which is affiliated with the Business Strategy Group):
“[a] DC-based hospitality management and trade consulting
practice that provides strategic, technical, political counsel, and support
services to help clients achieve their near and long-term political and economic
objectives. Founded in 2001 by Tom Prescott, an experienced policy advisor with
roots in both the hospitality industry and government, the firm specializes in
addressing hospitality sector business challenges and provides international
trade policy services in agriculture, other commercial trade, and general
services. Prescott Enterprises facilitates and enables market expansion and
provides specialized representation in the federal legislative and regulatory
processes. The firm maintains a relationship with Kissinger McLarty Associates
and has developed extensive relationships in the United States, particularly on
Capitol Hill and within the executive branch, as well as in similar sectors of
the European Union and a number of Asian nations.”
To
fulfill the reciprocal relationship, McLarty sits on the board of
advisors for Prescott.
Another curious company is Zemi Communications. Kissinger serves as its Chairman
Emeritus, and the company cites `strategic relationships’ with both
Kissinger Associates & Kissinger McLarty Associates. The company develops
and manages “communications programs for clients--major corporations and
governments--from around the world, particularly those who raise capital, sell
goods and services, or are affected by developments in the United States.” It’s
founder and President, Alan
Stoga, used to be a managing director of Kissinger Associates and still
serves as a director there. “He is currently Vice Chairman of the Americas Society and
served as acting president and CEO from November 2001 through June 2002.” – That
good old Council of the Americas strikes again! More on Stoga
below.
Of all of these associations, the most `troubling’ is
the relationship between Kissinger Associates, the Blackstone Group and the
American International Group (under the auspices of financial giant JP Morgan
Chase and lobbying entity The Council of the Americas.) Indeed, as I intend to
later show, the power brokers behind and within these five entities crop up so
frequently it appears as one giant behomoth. This is not to ignore the role the
companies have outside of the American trading bloc, but the total
liberalisation of trade between North and South America is a jewel in the crown
of Kissinger, Peter Peterson & Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Maurice
Greenberg of AIG, the ubiqutous David Rockefeller and others. Members of all
also bathe in the corporate and governmental weight of The Council on Foreign
Relations and The Trilateral Group.
That said, the Kissinger-Blackstone-AIG combo may indeed
have some far darker sides to its story. All have provided a home for Republican
`Cold-War Warriors’, who have long been tight with the highest echelons of both
United States government and its intelligence community. Many, many questions
arise about foreknowledge of 9-11. Fingers pointed at this group may not simply
be an erroneous product of a paranoid imagination. When
7, World Trade Center
fell, it was dwarfed by the far greater tragedy and suffering that occurred on
that fateful day. But slowly some curious truths are emerging about that
building. The Blackstone Group acquired the mortgage to the property back in
2000. The building housed the CIA, the New York Office of Emergency Management
and the Secret Service Electronic Crime Fighting Task Force. Citigroup `lost’
key documents relating to its dealings with Worldcom. The Greenberg
family of business’ profiteered greatly from selling insurance against
terrorist acts – which, if deemed `an act of war’ by Bush, they will never have
to pay up anyway.
Did any of the people have foreknowledge of 9-11? Did
they Let It
Happen On Purpose? Or could there have been more intimate knowledge and even
planning?

“Political satire became
obsolete when Henry Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize.” – Tom
Lehrer
Attempting a biography on a page such as this is an
impossibility. The man has an eerie omnipresence in American & Global
history. Instead, I will focus on a rather staccato list of his current
affiliations & salient parts of his past. In 1977 he made this comment: “The
Trilateral Commission was a government in exile.” He wasn’t lying.
Dr. Kissinger was born in Fuerth, Germany, on May 27, 1923,
came to the United States in 1938, and was naturalised a United States citizen
on June 19, 1943. From 1943 to 1946 Dr. Kissinger served in the U.S. Army
Counter-Intelligence Corps and from 1946 to 1949 was a captain in the Military
Intelligence Reserve. He received the BA Degree Summa Cum Laude at Harvard
College in 1950 and the MA and PhD Degrees at Harvard University in 1952 and
1954 respectively.
From 1954 until 1971 he was a member of the Faculty of
Harvard University, both in the Department of Government and at the Center for
International Affairs. He was Associate Director of the Center from 1957 to
1960. He served as Study Director, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy, for the
Council of Foreign Relations from 1955 to 1956; Director of the Special Studies
Project for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund from 1956 to 1958; Director of the
Harvard International Seminar from 1951 to 1971, and Director of the Harvard
Defense Studies Program from 1958 to 1971. (He was on leave of absence from
Harvard from January 1969 to January 1971).
Dr. Kissinger was sworn in on September 22, 1973, as the 56th
Secretary of State, a position he held until January 20, 1977. He also served as
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs from January 20, 1969,
until November 3, 1975. In July 1983, he was appointed by President Reagan to
chair the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America until it ceased
operation in January 1985, and from 1984-1990 he served as a member of the
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
The most objective biography of Henry Kissinger to date is
Walter Isaacson’s Kissinger:
A Biography. That such, much has come to light since Isaacson’s book,
specifically connected to Kissingers criminality. The best book dealing with
this is Christopher Hitchens The
Trial of Henry Kissinger.
Although there is a general sense of foreboding around
anything that Henry Kissinger does, it is worth remembering the specific charges
of conspiracy and criminality which are levied against him. An indictment of
Henry Kissinger for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes would
include (but not be confined to) the following:
VIETNAM:
Kissinger scuttled peace talks in 1968, paving the way for Richard Nixon's
victory in the presidential race. Half the battle deaths in Vietnam took place
between 1968 and 1972, not to mention the millions of civilians throughout
Indochina who were killed.
CAMBODIA:
Kissinger persuaded Nixon to widen the war with massive bombing of Cambodia and
Laos. No one had suggested we go to war with either of these countries. By
conservative estimates, the U.S. killed 600,000 civilians in Cambodia and
another 350,000 in Laos.
BANGLADESH:
Using weapons supplied by the U.S., General Yahya Khan overthrew the
democratically elected government and murdered at least half a million civilians
in 1971. In the White House, the National Security Council wanted to condemn
these actions. Kissinger refused. Amid the killing, Kissinger thanked Khan for
his "delicacy and tact."
CHILE:
Kissinger helped to plan the 1973 U.S.-backed overthrow of the democratically
elected Salvador Allende and the assassination of General René Schneider.
Right-wing general Augusto Pinochet then took over. Moderates fled for their
lives. Hit men, financed by the CIA, tracked down Allende supporters and killed
them. These attacks included the car bombing of Allende's foreign minister,
Orlando Letelier, and an aide, Ronni Moffitt, at Sheridan Circle in downtown
Washington.
EAST TIMOR:
In 1975 President Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger met with Indonesia's
corrupt strongman Suharto. Kissinger told reporters the U.S. wouldn't recognize
the tiny country of East Timor, which had recently won independence from the
Portuguese. Within hours Suharto launched an invasion, killing, by some
estimates, 200,000 civilians.
WASHINGTON: Personal
involvement in a plan to kidnap and murder a journalist - Elias Demetracopoulos
- living in Washington DC.

Christopher Hitchens own

In late August 2002, the State Department finally released a
series of documents concerning Argentina, which further implicate Kissinger’s
role as the Argentina military believed that the US (primarily Kissinger) had
given the go ahead to their coup to “get the terrorist problem under control as
quickly as possible”.
The National Security Archive is hosting a selection of these
documents: here and here. And
once again, Kissinger has found himself in
the news for all the wrong reasons.

President Clinton and Mack McLarty met in kindergarten in
their native town of Hope, Arkansas. Since that time, they have stayed in touch,
personally as well as professionally, and have always referred to each other as
"my oldest friend."
Student body president at the University of Arkansas at
Fayetteville, McLarty, at age 23, was elected to the Arkansas House of
Representatives. One of the youngest people ever to be elected to the Arkansas
House, McLarty later went on to serve as chairman of the Arkansas State
Democratic Party from 1974 through 1976. He was also treasurer in the successful
gubernatorial elections of Senator David Pryor and President Clinton.
McLarty became the youngest person ever elected to the Arkla board in 1974, and was named
president of Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company in 1983. McLarty was named chairman
and chief executive officer of Arkla, Inc. in 1985 and held this position until
being asked to serve as White House Chief of Staff after the election of
President Clinton in 1992. During McLarty's tenure, Arkla was recognized by
Forbes and Financial World magazines, as well as the Wall Street Transcript, as
one of the nation's most innovative companies in the natural gas industry.
Additionally, he was personally recognized on several occasions as one of the
natural gas industry's most outstanding chief executive officers.
He was appointed by President George Bush to the National Petroleum Council and the National
Council on Environmental Quality. He was a member of the St. Louis Federal
Reserve Board from 1989 through 1992.
Beginning in 1992, he served President Clinton in several key
positions: Chief of Staff, Counselor to the President, and Special Envoy for the
Americas, with over five years of service in the President's Cabinet and on the
National Economic Council. He holds a degree in business administration from the
University of Arkansas.
Mr. McLarty is Vice Chairman and serves on the
Board of Directors of Asbury Automotive
Group, Inc., which is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United
States. The McLarty Companies is comprised of 11 automotive dealerships located
in two states that generate in excess of $600 million. Mr. McLarty began his
career building the company his grandfather founded, McLarty Leasing Systems,
into one of the nation's largest transportation companies. He is also Chairman
and CEO of McLarty Companies, Inc, McLarty AutoMall and McLarty
Management Company, Inc., of Little Rock, Arkansas, and is Vice Chairman of

Senior Managing Director - Kissinger McLarty Associates
His tenure with Kissinger McLarty Associates may be soon
ending as he is running for Governor for New Mexico in the
upcoming gubernational elections in November. Just what the country needs. On June
5th 2002 he resigned from the boards of ten companies. These
were: Diamond Offshore Drilling
(of which Alan
Batkin is still a director), Peregrine
Systems, City National Corporation, American Energy Group Inc., Energy Investors Fund Group, Valero Corp., Venoco, Hispanic Radio Network, Intellibridge
Expert Network (of which ex-Kissinger McLarty Associates managing director
David
Rothkopf is CEO) and TerraSolar. He
has decided to stay with Kissinger McLarty Associates (for now at least). Given
that half of these companies and oil and gas related, his
post 9-11 article about the oil market and the war on terror – concluding:
“We should understand the Realpolitik of the Middle East, realize that a diverse
and competitive global oil market reduces our economic vulnerabilities and
defend America's national security interests without fear of setting off an
energy crisis” - comes as no great surprise. His closest ties are with Veneco.
As the Albuquerque Journal reports:
“However, he said he has had
a long-standing relationship with Valero. He said he is good friends with Bill
Greehey, Valero's chief executive officer and chairman of the board. Valero
contributed to Richardson's congressional campaigns in the 1990s, and the
company contributed $15,000 to his race for governor, according to documents
filed with the Secretary of State's Office.” (source)
In January 2002, he became
co-chairman of the South Asia
Regional Energy Coalition (SAREC), which “represents private sector
interests in the South Asia Regional Initiative/Energy (SARI/Energy), which is a
project of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).” We
also know that he received money from Salomon Smith
Barney (subsiduary of Citigroup & once housed in WTC7) – a disclosure which
is listed as “financial services, investments”.
Following his
unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate, Bill Richardson spent nearly
two-and-a-half years – from 1998 to 2001 - as Secretary
of Energy. Prior to becoming Energy Secretary, Richardson served as U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations between 1997-1998. At the U.N., Richardson
addressed numerous difficult international negotiating challenges and crises all
over the world.
Bill Richardson was born in Pasadena, Los Angeles County,
California on November 15, 1947. He attended school in Mexico City, and in 1966
he graduated from
Middlesex School, in Concord, Massachusetts. He studied at
Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, where he earned a B.A. degree (1970)
and received an M.A. (1971) from its Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
During 1971 to 1978 he was a staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
In 1980 Richardson unsuccessfully challenged incumbent
Congressman Manuel Luján. Following the creation of northern New Mexico's Third
District, Richardson won the 1982 election with sixty-seven percent of the vote.
He ran a successful campaign visiting small towns and pueblos, and was elected
by a primarily Hispanic and Native American constituency. He has subsequently
been reelected with large margins, averaging seventy percent of the vote. He
served as the US Representative for New Mexico from January 3, 1983 to February
13, 1997.
During his first term in Congress, Richardson won a coveted
seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is of particular importance to
New Mexico. He balanced his agenda between the interest of environmentalists and
important oil, gas, and uranium industries in his state.
In the 101st Congress, Richardson supported a plan to promote
the use of non-gasoline cars, parts of which were included in the Clean Air Act
re-authorization. As a member of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, he
has supported expansion of national parks and the designation of wild and scenic
rivers.
By the 103rd Congress, Richardson had risen to the position
of Chief Deputy Whip and led the fight in the House for the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He wrote articles advocating NAFTA for important
national newspapers and encouraged President Clinton to work with Mexico on
improving the environmental portions of the agreement in order to gain support
for NAFTA in Congress. Richardson also played a key role in passing President
Clinton's 1993 Deficit Reduction package and the 1994 Crime Bill. In addition to
his seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Richardson was the second-ranking
Democrat on the Select Intelligence Committee and served on the Natural
Resources Committee, where he chaired the Native American Affairs Subcommittee
which was created in the 103rd Congress.
In late 1994, Richardson travelled to North Korea to discuss
a nuclear agreement. He arrived the same day a U.S. helicopter was shot down by
the North Koreans and thereby was thrust into the position of negotiating for
the release of two U.S. pilots. After five days of tense talks, Richardson left
North Korea with the remains of one pilot and a promise that the surviving pilot
would be released "very soon." He returned home the following week.
Richardson's highly successful, but unexpected, foray into
North Korea was actually his third high profile foreign affairs experience in
1994. In July, he laid the groundwork for a peaceful resolution to the growing
Haitian crisis when he held a five and a half hour meeting with Haitian leader
General Raoul Cedras in Haiti. In February, Richardson travelled to Burma to
meet with Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate, and leader of the persecuted
democracy movement, and then convinced military leaders to open talks about her
release. Richardson was the first non-family member allowed to visit the
dissident in her more than five years under house arrest.

also sits) and a director
of Phillips Petroleum. The merger of
Phillips with Conoco to create ConocoPhillips was created on August

On October 11th 2001, Ambassador Bremer became
chairman and chief executive officer of the Crisis Consulting Practice of Marsh
Inc., an operating company of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC).
Marsh's Crisis Consulting Practice provides services to corporations to help
them plan for, manage and recover from a full range of crises such as natural
disasters, product recalls, workplace violence and terrorism. Bremer also has
been responsible for Marsh's political risk business since he joined the firm in
October 2000.
Prior to joining Marsh, Bremer had been managing director at
Kissinger Associates, a strategic consulting firm headed by former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. He joined the Kissinger firm in 1989 after a
23-year career in the diplomatic service, which he left after attaining the rank
of ambassador-at-large.
Ambassador Bremer joined the Diplomatic Service in 1966. His
overseas assignments included service as political, economic and commercial
officer at the American Embassies in Afghanistan and Malawi. From 1976 to 1979,
he was the Deputy Ambassador and charge' d'affaires at the American Embassy in
Oslo, Norway. During his Washington assignments Ambassador Bremer served as
Special Assistant or Executive Assistant to six Secretaries of State. In 1981,
Secretary Haig appointed him Executive Secretary of the State Department and
Special Assistant to the Secretary of State. In this post, Ambassador Bremer
directed, among other things, the State Department's 24-hour a day crisis
management and emergency response center.
President Reagan named Ambassador Bremer as the United States
Ambassador to the Netherlands in 1983 where he served for over three years. In
1986, the President appointed him Ambassador-at-Large for Counter Terrorism
responsible for developing and implementing America's global policies to combat
terrorism. He served as top advisor to the President and Secretary of State on
terrorism for the next three years.
In September 1999, Speaker of the House of Representatives
Hastert appointed Ambassador Bremer Chairman of the National Commission on
Terrorism. The Commission's mandate was to review America's counter-terrorism
policies. The Commission reported its findings and recommendations to the
President of the United States and to the Speaker in June 2000.
Bremer is a director of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.,
Akzo Nobel NV and The Netherland-America Foundation. He is a Trustee of the

Bremer on 9-11: “"I am sort of agnostic at this point as to
whether we knew enough to stop" Sept. 11, said L. Paul Bremer, former ambassador
at large for counterterrorism during the Reagan administration.
But "as they go through this in the intelligence committees,
you're probably going to come up with other data points" like the Phoenix memo
and information in the CIA's files on the two hijackers, said Bremer.
"Then the question is, `Is there anybody who had access to
all of these data points so that he could have had a broader picture and taken
steps that actually would have made a difference?"' asked the former ambassador,
who now heads a crisis consulting firm in Washington.” (source)

Renato Ruggiero was born in Naples on 9 April 1930. After
graduating with a law degree from the University of Naples in 1953, he entered
the Italian diplomatic service.
His first posting abroad was to the Italian Consulate in Sao
Paolo, Brazil. In January 1959, he was assigned to the Italian Embassy in
Moscow, where he worked towards the normalisation of cultural and trade
relations between the Soviet Union and Italy during the years of
destalinisation, the confrontation in Berlin and the emerging Sino- Soviet
conflict. In 1962 he was posted to the Italian Embassy in Washington, where he
monitored the last phase of the Kennedy Administration, the development of the
Cuban Missile Crisis, East-West relations and the Vietnam War.
In 1964 he returned to Rome as Head of the Political Affairs
Secretariat of the Foreign Ministry. In 1966 he was assigned to the Italian
Embassy in Belgrade, where he monitored developments in the Cold Wad and the
events of the 1968 Prague Spring.
After a short interval in Rome, he began the second phase of
his diplomatic career in 1969. Posted to the Italian Mission to the European
Community in Brussels, he negotiated a fundamental agreement on social security
for migrant workers. In July 1970 he was appointed Chef de Cabinet of the
President of the European Commission, Franco Malfatti. In this role, he
participated in the negotiations that led to the accession of the United
Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland to the EEC, and in the development of the first
European Economic and Monetary Union project and in the official launch of the
European Union project at the European Summit in Paris in 1972.
After a brief period as Political Advisor to the President of
the European Commission, Sicco Mansholt, he was appointed Director General for
Regional Policy at the European Commission in Brussels. In this role he
negotiated and created, with Commissioner George Thomson, the European Regional
Development Fund, the most significant instrument of financial support for the
less developed regions in Europe.
In 1977 he was appointed Spokesman of the President of the
European Commission, Roy Jenkins, whom he assisted in the negotiations that led
to the launch of the European Monetary System.
Between 1978 – the year he returned to the Foreign Ministry
in Rome – and 1987 Ruggiero occupied several positions at the highest level of
the Italian diplomatic service: he negotiated Italy’s entry into the European
Monetary System, was the Diplomatic Advisor of the Prime Minister and the Chef
de Cabinet of two Foreign Ministers. In 1980, he was appointed Ambassador and
returned to Brussels as Italy’s Permanent Representative to the European
Community. After four years in that position, he was appointed Director General
for Economic Affairs at the Foreign Ministry in Rome (1984-1985) and then
reached the highest position in the diplomatic service when he became Secretary
General of the Foreign Ministry (1985- 1987). During this period he also was the
Personal Representative of the Prime Minister for six G7 summits, and the
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the OECD in Paris.
In 1987, Ambassador Ruggiero was appointed Italian Minister
for Foreign Trade, a post he held until 1991. During this period, he implemented
the programme of liberalisation of Italy’s foreign trade and capital
movements.
After his service in government, Renato Ruggiero left the
diplomatic service and joined the board of directors of FIAT and of several
other Italian, European and American companies, either as a director or as an
international consultant.
In 1995, Ambassador Ruggiero was elected Director General of
the World Trade Organisation in Geneva by its 130 member countries, and served
in that role until 1999. During this period, he promoted the implementation of a
trade dispute settlement system based on the rule of law and not on power. He
also promoted the further inclusion of developing countries in trade flows, and
the liberalisation of trade with the 48 least developed countries. In addition,
Ambassador Ruggiero began an institutional dialogue with the Non – Governmental
Organisations (NGOs). During his term at the WTO, telecommunications,
information technology and financial services were liberalised on a global
basis.
Following his tenure at the WTO, Ambassador Ruggiero was
appointed Chairman of ENI. He left that position in September 1999 and became
Vice-Chairman of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney International and Chairman of
Schroder Salomon Smith Barney Italy. He also served on the Board of Directors or
Advisory Boards of several important companies in Italy and the rest of the
world. [These included Kissinger Associates – the only
sources I have on this are frustratingly in Italian]
He has been appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in the
second Government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on 11 June 2001. He
resigned on January 6th 2002 following a
disagreement with Berlusconi over the Euro.
In recognition of his contributions to public life, the
President of the Italian Republic made Ambassador Ruggiero a Knight of the Grand
Cross. Foreign governments have also recognised his work in the cause of
international trade and diplomacy. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has bestowed
upon him the honorary award of Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and
St. George; His Majesty Emperor Hirohito of Japan has honoured him with the
Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure; and His Holiness John Paul II
has named him Knight Grand Cross of the equestrian order of St. Gregory the
Great. (source)
He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
