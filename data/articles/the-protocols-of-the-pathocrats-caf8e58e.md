In this week's podcast (see below) we discuss
what we have identified as the very first problem that must be solved in
order for positive changes to be undertaken in American and elsewhere in the
world: the Media.
Knowledge is power. Those who control information can control the masses;
it's that simple.
As we researched the subject of the media, we came across
The
Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. As everyone knows, this
is a vicious anti-Semitic hoax. We agree.
We do not for a minute think that
this represents Judaism or ordinary Jewish people.
What was shocking for us was our realization that the Protocols is being
implemented almost line by line by many of the members of the Bush
Administration and the various government 'think-tanks' that formulate
their policy. In other words, the Protocols is not a hoax because it is
nonsense, but rather it is only a hoax because it was attributed to Jews.
Here, we present the text of
Protocol 12 from which several excerpts were read on the podcast
and which we jokingly referred to as "The Gospel According to Karl Rove."
Read it and understand that this is, indeed, the number one issue that
America must deal with before they can do a single other thing.
PROTOCOL No. 12
Control of the Press
1. The word "freedom," which can be interpreted in various ways, is
defined by us as follows -
2. Freedom is the right to do what which the law allows. This
interpretation of the word will at the proper time be of service to us,
because all freedom will thus be in our hands, since the laws will
abolish or create only that which is desirable for us according to the
aforesaid program.
3. We shall deal with the press in the following way: what is the part
played by the press to-day? It serves to excite and inflame those
passions which are needed for our purpose or else it serves selfish ends
of parties. It is often vapid, unjust, mendacious, and the majority of
the public have not the slightest idea what ends the press really
serves. We shall saddle and bridle it with a tight curb: we shall do the
same also with all productions of the printing press, for where would be
the sense of getting rid of the attacks of the press if we remain
targets for pamphlets and books?
The produce of publicity, which nowadays is
a source of heavy expense owing to the necessity of censoring it, will
be turned by us into a very lucrative source of income to our State: we
shall lay on it a special stamp tax and require deposits of
caution-money before permitting the establishment of any organ of the
press or of printing offices; these will then have to guarantee our
government against any kind of attack on the part of the press.
For any attempt to attack us, if such still be possible, we shall
inflict fines without mercy. Such measures as stamp tax, deposit of
caution-money and fines secured by these deposits, will bring in a huge
income to the government. It is true that party organs might not spare
money for the sake of publicity, but these we shall shut up at the
second attack upon us. No one shall with impunity lay a finger on the
aureole of our government infallibility. The pretext for stopping any
publication will be the alleged plea that it is agitating the public
mind without occasion or justification.
I BEG YOU TO NOTE THAT AMONG THOSE MAKING
ATTACKS UPON US WILL ALSO BE ORGANS ESTABLISHED BY US, BUT THEY WILL
ATTACK EXCLUSIVELY POINTS THAT WE HAVE PRE-DETERMINED TO ALTER.
WE CONTROL THE PRESS
4. NOT A SINGLE ANNOUNCEMENT WILL REACH THE PUBLIC WITHOUT OUR
CONTROL. Even now this is already being attained by us inasmuch as all
news items are received by a few agencies, in whose offices they are
focused from all parts of the world. These agencies will then be already
entirely ours and will give publicity only to what we dictate to them.
5. If already now we have contrived to possess ourselves of the minds of
the GOY communities to such an extent the they all come near looking
upon the events of the world through the colored glasses of those
spectacles we are setting astride their noses; if already now there is
not a single State where there exist for us any barriers to admittance
into what GOY stupidity calls State secrets: what will our positions be
then, when we shall be acknowledged supreme lords of the world in the
person of our king of all the world....
6. Let us turn again to the FUTURE OF THE PRINTING PRESS. Every one
desirous of being a publisher, librarian, or printer, will be obliged to
provide himself with the diploma instituted therefore, which, in case of
any fault, will be immediately impounded.
With such measures THE INSTRUMENT OF THOUGHT
WILL BECOME AN EDUCATIVE MEANS ON THE HANDS OF OUR GOVERNMENT, WHICH
WILL NO LONGER ALLOW THE MASS OF THE NATION TO BE LED ASTRAY IN BY-WAYS
AND FANTASIES ABOUT THE BLESSINGS OF PROGRESS.
Is there any one of us who does not know
that these phantom blessings are the direct roads to foolish imaginings
which give birth to anarchical relations of men among themselves and
towards authority, because progress, or rather the idea of progress, has
introduced the conception of every kind of emancipation, but has failed
to establish its limits.... All the so-called liberals are anarchists,
if not in fact, at any rate in thought. Every one of them in hunting
after phantoms of freedom, and falling exclusively into license, that
is, into the anarchy of protest for the sake of protest....
FREE PRESS DESTROYED
7. We turn to the periodical press. We shall impose on it, as on all
printed matter, stamp taxes per sheet and deposits of caution-money, and
books of less than 30 sheets will pay double. We shall reckon them as
pamphlets in order, on the one hand, to reduce the number of magazines,
which are the worst form of printed poison, and, on the other, in order
that this measure may force writers into such lengthy productions that
they will be little read, especially as they will be costly.
At the same time what we shall publish
ourselves to influence mental development in the direction laid down for
our profit will be cheap and will be read voraciously. The tax will
bring vapid literary ambitions within bounds and the liability to
penalties will make literary men dependent upon us. And if there should
be any found who are desirous of writing against us, they will not find
any person eager to print their productions.
Before accepting any production for
publication in print, the publisher or printer will have to apply to the
authorities for permission to do so. Thus we shall know beforehand of
all tricks preparing against us and shall nullify them by getting ahead
with explanations on the subject treated of.
8. Literature and journalism are two of the most important educative
forces, and therefore our government will become proprietor of the
majority of the journals. This will neutralize the injurious influence
of the privately-owned press and will put us in possession of a
tremendous influence upon the public mind.... If we give permits for
ten journals, we shall ourselves found thirty, and so on in the same
proportion. This, however, must in no wise be suspected by the public.
For which reason all journals published by us will be of the most
opposite, in appearance, tendencies and opinions, thereby creating
confidence in us and bringing over to us quite unsuspicious opponents,
who will thus fall into our trap and be rendered harmless.
9. In the front rank will stand organs of an official character. They
will always stand guard over our interests, and therefore their
influence will be comparatively insignificant.
10. In the second rank will be the semi-official organs, whose part it
will be to attack the tepid and indifferent.
11. In the third rank we shall set up our own, to all appearance,
opposition, which, in at least one of its organs, will present what
looks like the very antipodes to us. Our real opponents at heart will
accept this simulated opposition as their own and will show us their
cards.
12. All our newspapers will be of all possible complexions --
aristocratic, republican, revolutionary, even anarchical - for so long,
of course, as the constitution exists.... Like the Indian idol "Vishnu"
they will have a hundred hands, and every one of them will have a finger
on any one of the public opinions as required.
When a pulse quickens these hands will lead
opinion in the direction of our aims, for an excited patient loses all
power of judgment and easily yields to suggestion. Those fools who will
think they are repeating the opinion of a newspaper of their own camp
will be repeating our opinion or any opinion that seems desirable for
us. In the vain belief that they are following the organ of their party
they will, in fact, follow the flag which we hang out for them.
13. In order to direct our newspaper militia in this sense we must take
special and minute care in organizing this matter. Under the title of
central department of the press we shall institute literary gatherings
at which our agents will without attracting attention issue the orders
and watchwords of the day.
By discussing and controverting, but always
superficially, without touching the essence of the matter, our organs
will carry on a sham fight fusillade with the official newspapers solely
for the purpose of giving occasion for us to express ourselves more
fully than could well be done from the outset in official announcements,
whenever, of course, that is to our advantage.
14. THESE ATTACKS UPON US WILL ALSO SERVE ANOTHER PURPOSE, NAMELY, THAT
OUR SUBJECTS WILL BE CONVINCED TO THE EXISTENCE OF FULL FREEDOM OF
SPEECH AND SO GIVE OUR AGENTS AN OCCASION TO AFFIRM THAT ALL ORGANS
WHICH OPPOSE US ARE EMPTY BABBLERS, since they are incapable of finding
any substantial objections to our orders.
ONLY LIES PRINTED
15. Methods of organization like these, imperceptible to the public
eye but absolutely sure, are the best calculated to succeed in bringing
the attention and the confidence of the public to the side of our
government. Thanks to such methods we shall be in a position as from
time to time may be required, to excite or to tranquillize the public
mind on political questions, to persuade or to confuse, printing now
truth, now lies, facts or their contradictions, according as they may be
well or ill received, always very cautiously feeling our ground before
stepping upon it....
WE SHALL HAVE A SURE TRIUMPH OVER OUR
OPPONENTS SINCE THEY WILL NOT HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSITION ORGANS OF THE
PRESS IN WHICH THEY CAN GIVE FULL AND FINAL EXPRESSION TO THEIR VIEWS
owing to the aforesaid methods of dealing with the press. We shall not
even need to refute them except very superficially.
16. Trial shots like these, fired by us in the third rank of our press,
in case of need, will be energetically refuted by us in our
semi-official organs.
17. Even nowadays, already, to take only the French press, there are
forms which reveal masonic solidarity in acting on the watchword: all
organs of the press are bound together by professional secrecy; like the
augurs of old, not one of their numbers will give away the secret of his
sources of information unless it be resolved to make announcement of
them. Not one journalist will venture to betray this secret, for not one
of them is ever admitted to practice literature unless his whole past
has some disgraceful sore or other.... These sores would be immediately
revealed. So long as they remain the secret of a few the prestige of the
journalist attacks the majority of the country - the mob follow after
him with enthusiasm.
18. Our calculations are especially extended to the provinces. It is
indispensable for us to inflame there those hopes and impulses with
which we could at any moment fall upon the capital, and we shall
represent to the capitals that these expressions are the independent
hopes and impulses of the provinces. Naturally, the source of them will
be always one and the same - ours.
WHAT WE NEED IS THAT, UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE
ARE IN THE PLENITUDE POWER, THE CAPITALS SHOULD FIND THEMSELVES STIFLED
BY THE PROVINCIAL OPINION OF THE NATIONS, I.E., OF A MAJORITY ARRANGED
BY OUR AGENTUR. What we need is that at the psychological moment the
capitals should not be in a position to discuss an accomplished fact for
the simple reason, if for no other, that it has been accepted by the
public opinion of a majority in the provinces.
19. WHEN WE ARE IN THE PERIOD OF THE NEW REGIME TRANSITIONAL TO THAT OF
OUR ASSUMPTION OF FULL SOVEREIGNTY WE MUST NOT ADMIT ANY REVELATION BY
THE PRESS OF ANY FORM OF PUBLIC DISHONESTY; IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE NEW
REGIME SHOULD BE THOUGHT TO HAVE SO PERFECTLY CONTENDED EVERYBODY THAT
EVEN CRIMINALITY HAS DISAPPEARED...
Cases of the manifestation of criminality
should remain known only to their victims and to chance witnesses - no
more.
Additional Analysis
The Protocols of The Pathocrats
by Laura Knight Jadczyk
19 February 2006
from
LauraKnightJadczykBlog Website
Over the last few weeks, as
the Cartoon Controversy has raged, bringing
death, destruction, and the collapse of diplomatic relations, we have been
watching and assessing the global situation. I find it quite fascinating
that such a thing as a few cartoons could trigger so much violence. Yes, I
know what all the pundits - both mainstream and alternative - are saying
about it.
On the one side, the mainstream depicts the
problem as the dangers of Islam, and on the other side, the more soothing
voices point out reasonably that everyones beliefs ought to be respected
and certainly anyone can see that right now - when there is an apparent War
on Islam and so many Muslims suffering oppression - it was a very, very bad
idea, if not entirely manipulative, to publish said cartoons.
And on and on it goes.
We then consider the fact that, while this is going on,
George Bush and his Neocon puppetmasters are breaking
the law and declaring dictatorial powers in exactly the same ways Hitler and
his Devils Disciples did, and the media is - for the most part - simply
doing nothing. Oh, sure, there is a surface appearance now and again that
maybe one or another media organ is "getting it" or has "courage" or
whatever. But it never amounts to anything.
An article or two is published, the alternative
media feels a flutter in the breast, gets some hope, and then it all dies
down and fades away in a day or two. Nothing changes, the Neocons continue
their jackbooted march across the globe, and we draw closer and closer to a
Nuclear Holocaust.
Looking back over history, again and again we see the same phenomenon and in
every single case we identify the same fact that enables the process: the
purveyors of information are the hands on the wheel that steer the masses of
people in whatever direction those in power wish.
And so, this issue of the Media as the number one problem we need to deal
with is what I want to talk about today.
Charles Sullivan writes in an article we carried yesterday, The
Making of a Zombie Culture:
My mother is a devotee of the CBS evening
news that was anchored by Dan Rather. I do not know who anchors the
program now. If my mother does not hear about something on the CBS
evening news, she does not believe it. On the other hand, I get none of
my news from the televised media, because I know they are not telling us
the truth either by content or by omission. When I discuss the issues
with my mother she is often incredulous about what I tell her, doubting
my authenticity. Like millions of other Americans, my mother fails to
grasp the extent of the propaganda that is used to manipulate and
misshape her views.
The effectiveness of the corporate propaganda campaign in accomplishing
this end is demonstrated by the following example. Millions of viewers
refuse to believe that the US engages in a world wide campaign of
torture and prisoner abuse. These viewers summarily reject the
documented evidence to the contrary, and the graphic testimony of the
gulag survivors themselves. This is news that CBS does not report.
Propaganda appeals to the emotional side of the human brain, while
circumventing the side that evokes critical thinking. Therefore, the
systematic torture of captives is a non-event for the consumers of the
corporate news, whose minds have been deftly manipulated to reach this
conclusion without their knowledge. This is only one of many incidents
that explain the appalling ignorance that characterizes the American
public. It is this kind of ignorance that allows the public to believe
the most horrendous lies, while coaxing them to act against their own
self interest.
None are more hopelessly enslaved than those
who think they are free.
Then, in another article from the current issue
of NewScientist, The secret to soap opera addiction, we learn:
WE REMEMBER juicy gossip about our friends
and acquaintances far more readily than more mundane details about their
lives - which may explain why people become so addicted to gossipy media
such as soap operas.
To find out whether gossip spreads through groups of people better than
other information about them, UK-based researchers Alex Mesoudi
and Andrew Whiten of the University of St Andrews and Robin Dunbar of
the University of Liverpool used a method akin to "Chinese whispers".
They gave 10 people four different passages to read and then asked them
to write down what they could remember. Their efforts were passed to
another set of volunteers as passages for them to learn, and the process
was repeated four times.
The researchers then tried to tally the original passages with the final
results. They found that gossip-like information involving deception and
infidelity, and details involving general information about the
interactions of third parties, were remembered and transmitted in
greater quantity and with greater accuracy than purely descriptive
information about individuals or their environment.
In short, lies - salacious, vicious,
life-destroying , people dividing, hate engendering - propagate more readily
than truth. That must be why it was seen as necessary, in ancient times, to
include a "law" about "bearing false witness against a neighbor" as is
included in the Ten Commandments.
Notice that there is no commandment against
lying, per se, only against "bearing false witness"! It was apparently
deemed to be so destructive to society - and obviously so rampant in that
specific society - that it had to be directly addressed in that short "law
code" that has been passed down to us.
But "bearing false witness" seems to be what the Media does best as anyone
who has been paying attention for a very long time will surely have noticed.
Charles Sullivan writes in the above
referenced article:
If we are to understand the current media
crisis, it is necessary to comprehend who the commercial media serves.
The corporate media exists to serve the status quo, not to inform the
people, as is widely assumed by its consumers. It serves the private
sector, the bottom line, not the public interest, or the Commonwealth.
The commercial media cooperates with those
in power to program the public mind by creating propaganda that in
essence engenders specific emotional responses, and creates a belief
system favorable to the status quo. In essence, the consumers mind is
programmed to accept the official version of events, without
consideration of any and all contradictory evidence.
Well crafted propaganda compels the people
to act in the corporate interest, even as they operate in ways harmful
to themselves and the public interest.
Even though we are small and poorly funded,
the SOTT team has a few advantages that larger, well funded, news
agencies have over most alternative news sites: multilingual participants
that make us able to scan the news in several languages. Sometimes, if we
find a story in a foreign language and cannot find an English translation
already prepared, we will translate it ourselves. In this way, we are able
to contrast and compare what news is being reported where, and most
importantly: HOW it is being reported.
We make note of variances and similarities and
try to analyze it in the context of the culture in which it is being
reported. There ARE variances and there ARE similarities, but generally they
do not depend on the culture or location so much as WHO OWNS the media
source that is reporting. That is the one thing that is most sharply
defined. It is also something that has led to certain observations and
conclusions.
I wrote in my editorial accompanying this weeks
podcast, The Protocols of the Pathocrats (report on top page):
In this weeks podcast we discuss what we
have identified as the very first problem that must be solved in order
for positive changes to be undertaken in America and elsewhere in the
world: the Media.
Knowledge is power. Those who control information can control the
masses; its that simple.
As we researched the subject of the media, we came across
The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. As everyone
knows, this is a vicious anti-Semitic hoax. We agree. We do not for a
minute think that this represents Judaism or ordinary Jewish people.
What was shocking for us was our realization that the Protocols is being
implemented almost line by line by many of the members of the Bush
Administration and the various government think-tanks that formulate
their policy. In other words, the Protocols is not a hoax because it is
nonsense, but rather it is only a hoax because it was attributed to
Jews.
Here, we present the text of Protocol 12 from which several excerpts
were read on the podcast and which we jokingly referred to as "The
Gospel According to Karl Rove."
Read it and understand that this is, indeed, the number one issue that
America must deal with before they can do a single other thing.
We then included the complete text of Protocol
12. Im not going to do that here because I want to talk about this subject
in a different way. What we are dealing with are two problems here:
(1) the lies of the Media (or
individuals)
(2) how they are received/assimilated by
masses of people (or individuals)
Let me try to deal with these issues by way of a
few quotes that I hope will convey the necessary information.
First, a quote from psychologist, Andrew
Lobaczewskis book,
Ponerology:
Schizoidia:
Schizoidia, or schizoidal psychopathy, was
isolated by the very first of the famous creators of modern psychiatry.
From the beginning, it was treated as a lighter form of the same
hereditary taint which is the cause of susceptibility to schizophrenia.
However, this latter connection could neither be confirmed nor denied
with the help of statistical analysis, and no biological test was then
found which would have been able to solve this dilemma.
Literature provides us with descriptions of several varieties of this
anomaly, whose existence can be attributed either to changes in the
genetic factor or to differences in other individual characteristics of
a non-pathological nature. Let us thus sketch these sub-species common
features.
Carriers of this anomaly are hypersensitive and distrustful, but they
pay little attention to the feelings of others, tend to assume extreme
positions, and are eager to retaliate for minor offenses.
Sometimes they are eccentric and odd.
Their poor sense of psychological situation and reality leads them to
superimpose erroneous, pejorative interpretations upon other peoples
intentions.
They easy become involved in activities which are ostensibly moral, but
which actually inflict damage upon themselves and others.
Their impoverished psychological worldview makes them typically
pessimistic regarding human nature. We frequently find expressions of
their characteristic attitudes in their statements and writings: "Human
nature is so bad that order in human society can only be maintained by a
strong power created by highly qualified individuals in the name of some
higher idea." Let us call this typical expression the "schizoid
declaration"
(Here I want to note that the Schizoidal type generally
believes that THEY are the carriers of the knowledge of how human
society can be "fixed" - and they alone.)
When they become wrapped up in situations of serious stress, however,
the schizoids failings cause them to collapse easily. The capacity for
thought is thereupon characteristically stifled, and frequently the
schizoids fall into reactive psychotic states so similar in appearance
to schizophrenia that they lead to misdiagnoses.
The common factor in the varieties of this anomaly is a dull pallor of
emotions and feeling for the psychological realities. This can be
attributed to the incomplete quality of the instinctive substratum,
which is working as though on sand. Low emotional pressure enables them
to develop proper speculative reasoning, which is useful in
non-humanistic spheres of activity. Because of their one-sidedness, they
tend to consider themselves intellectually superior to "ordinary"
people.
The quantitative frequency of this anomaly varies among races and
nations: low among Blacks, the highest among Jews. Estimates of this
frequency range from negligible up to 3 %. In Poland it may be estimated
as 0.7 % of population. My observations suggest this anomaly is
autosomally hereditary.
A schizoids ponerological activity should be evaluated in two aspects.
On the small scale, such people cause their families trouble, easily
turn into tools of intrigue in the hands of clever individuals
Their tendency to see human reality in the doctrinaire and simplistic
manner they consider "proper", transforms their frequently good
intentions into bad results. However, their ponerogenic role can take on
macro-social proportions if their attitude toward human reality and
their tendency to invent great doctrines are put to paper and duplicated
in large editions.
In spite of their typical deficits, or even an openly schizoidal
declaration, their readers do not realize what the authors characters
are like; they interpret such works in a manner corresponding to their
own nature. The minds of normal people tend toward corrective
interpretation thanks to the participation of their own richer,
psychological world-view. However, many readers critically reject such
works with moral disgust but without being aware of the specific cause.
An analysis of the role played by Karl Marxs works easily reveals all
the above-mentioned types of apperception and the social reactions which
engendered separations among people. [
]
During stable times which are ostensibly happy, albeit marked by
injustice to individuals and nations, [schizoidal] doctrinaire people
believe they have found a simple solution to fix such a world. Such a
historical period is always characterized by a generally impoverished
psychological world-view, and so a schizoidally impoverished
psychological world-view does not stand out during such times and is
accepted as legal tender.
These doctrinaire individuals characteristically manifest a certain
contempt with regard to moralists then preaching the need to rediscover
lost human values and to develop a richer, more appropriate
psychological world-view.
Schizoid characters aim to impose their own conceptual world upon other
people or social groups, using relatively controlled pathological
egotism and the exceptional tenacity derived from their persistent
nature.
They are thus eventually able to overpower another individuals
personality, which causes the latters behavior to turn desperately
illogical. They may also exert a similar influence upon the group of
people they have joined.
They are psychological loners who feel better in some human
organization, wherein they become zealots for some ideology, religious
bigots, materialists, or adherents of an ideology with satanic features.
If their activities consist of direct contact on a small social scale,
their acquaintances easily perceive them to be eccentric, which limits
their ponerogenic role. However, if they manage to hide their own
personality behind the written word, their influence may poison the
minds of society in a wide scale and for a long time.
The conviction that Karl Marx is the best example of this is correct as
he was the best-known figure of that kind. Frostig, a psychiatrist of
the old school, included Engels and others into a category he called
"bearded schizoidal fanatics". The famous utterances attributed to
Zionist wise men at the turn of the century start with a schizoidal
declaration.
The nineteenth century, especially its
latter half, appears to have been a time of exceptional activity on the
part of schizoidal individuals, often but not always of Jewish descent.
After all we have to remember that 97% of all Jews do not manifest this
anomaly, and that it also appears among all European nations, albeit to
a markedly lesser extent. Our inheritance from this period includes
world-images, scientific traditions, and legal concepts flavored with
the shoddy ingredients of a schizoidal apprehension of reality.
In spite of the fact that the writings of schizoidal authors contain the
above described deficiency, or even an openly formulated schizoidal
declaration which constitutes sufficient warning to specialists, the
average reader accepts them not as a view of reality warped by this
anomaly, but rather as an idea to which he should assume an attitude
based on his convictions and his reason. That is the first mistake.
The oversimplified pattern, devoid of psychological color and based on
easily available data, exerts an intense influence upon individuals who
are insufficiently critical, frequently frustrated as result of downward
social adjustment, culturally neglected, or characterized by some
psychological deficiencies. Others are provoked to criticism based on
their healthy common sense, also they fail to grasp this essential cause
of the error
.
We can distinguish two distinctly different apperception types among
those persons who accept the contents of such works: the
critically-corrective and the pathological.
People whose feel for psychological reality is normal tend to
incorporate chiefly the more valuable elements of the work. They
trivialize the obvious errors and complement the schizoid deficiencies
by means of their own richer world-view. This gives rise to a more
sensible, measured, and thus creative interpretation, but is not free
from the influence of the error frequently adduced above.
Pathological acceptance is manifested by individuals with diverse
deviations, whether inherited or acquired, as well as by many people
bearing personality malformations or who have been injured by social
injustice.
Schizoidia has thus played an essential role as one of the factors in
the genesis of the evil threatening our contemporary world. Practicing
psychotherapy upon the world will therefore demand that the results of
such evil be eliminated as skillfully as possible.
.
In the ponerogenic process of the pathocratic phenomenon,
characteropathic individuals adopt ideologies created by doctrinaire,
often schizoidal people, recast them into an active propaganda form, and
disseminate it with pathological egotism and paranoid intolerance for
any philosophies which may differ from their own.
Underneath the rulership of [a pathocracy] we can even discern a period
of hyperactivity on the part of schizoidal individuals mesmerized by the
vision of their own rule based on contempt for human nature, especially
if they are numerous within a given country.
In non-semitic nations, schizoidals are somewhat more numerous than
essential psychopaths; although highly active in the early phases of the
genesis of the phenomenon, they betray an attraction to pathocracy as
well as the rational distance of efficient thinking; Thus they are torn
between such a system and the society of normal people.
Lobaczewski is telling us that the people
who are easily taken in by Schizoidal propaganda are either normal people
who are insufficiently critical and who project onto the content their own
"interpretations", or they are, themselves, suffering from some sort of
psychological or character defect.
From other sources we discover that the average
number of character disordered individuals may be as high as 20 % of the
population. That means that 80 % of the population has the potential to wake
up and smell the coffee. Well come back to that.
For now, pay particular attention to the
described "driving mechanism" of the Schizoidal Psychopath:
Schizoid characters aim to impose their own
conceptual world upon other people or social groups..
In other words, they intend to "superimpose
erroneous, pejorative interpretations upon other peoples intentions" and
actions which then leads them to their "Schizoidal Declaration" that the
"other" (an individual or society) is "so bad" that they, (the schizoidal
psychopath) and they alone, are duty bound to fix this error and bringing
justice to that individual or society. And this is, of course, all framed in
the context of some "higher power." And the method by which they go about
this is truly astonishing to observe.
As Lobaczewski describes it:
"using relatively controlled pathological
egotism and the exceptional tenacity derived from their persistent
nature, they are eventually able to overpower another individuals
personality, which causes the latters behavior to turn desperately
illogical. They may also exert a similar influence upon the group of
people they have joined."
Careful reading of certain internet Bulletin
Boards will give the student of psychology ample, rich examples of this
activity.
In short, the Schizoidal Psychopath is a type of "bully."
The bullying of a schizoidal type is almost entirely psychological, taking
the form of trivial nit-picking criticism, constant fault-finding, citing
their version of reality as "fact," while omitting any real data, and
managing to persuade the listener or reader that they HAVE produced data
when, in fact, they have not; this, combined with a simultaneous refusal to
recognize, value or acknowledge anything anyone else does as even remotely
positive, (they are the "expert"), all serve to overpower the personality of
the listener.
The sheer, dogged, persistence, the repeated
claims of being right and only after "justice," eventually wear out the
listener or reader, especially if this is accompanied by co-horts who jump
in from time to time with violent or illogical claims which make the
Schizoidal psychopath seem all that much more sane when they reprove their
co-horts for such nasty behavior.
Such manipulation also includes feigning
victimhood or persecution, especially when called to account for their
nonsense or when actual data is demanded.
The objectives of schizoids are:
-
Power
-
Control
-
Domination
-
Subjugation
They go after their goals by a number of means
including verbal disempowerment of others, attempting to stimulate fear,
shame, embarrassment and guilt, humiliation and constant denial that this is
what they are doing. They are generally assisted by a "Greek Chorus" of
"clappers".
A favorite tactic of the schizoid is to set people against each other.
The benefits to the schizoid are that:
-
he/she gains a great deal of
gratification (a perverse form of satisfaction) from encouraging and
provoking argument, quarrelling and hostility, and then from
watching others engage in adversarial interaction and destructive
conflict
-
the ensuing conflict ensures that
peoples attention is distracted and diverted away from the cause of
the conflict. They can then come in and be the "calm voice of
reason," and thus subvert the logic and reason and emotions of the
target
Schizoids are adept at distorting peoples
perceptions with intent to engender a negative view of their target in the
minds of others; this is achieved through undermining, the creation of
doubts and suspicions by clever twisting of minor facts, and the sharing of
false concerns, etc.
This poisoning of peoples minds is difficult to
counter because it is often quite subtle. It often takes time and experience
for those taken in by the schizoid to see through the mask of deceit and to
understand how and why they are being used as pawns.
The schizoid often tries to establish an exclusive relationship (based on
apparent trust and confidence) with targeted individuals so that they (the
schizoid) are seen as the sole reliable source of information; this may be
achieved by portraying the target as irresponsible, unstable, undependable,
uncaring, unreliable and untrustworthy, perhaps by the constant highlighting
- using distortion and fabrication - of alleged failures, breaches of trust,
lack of reliability, etc. The process is reinforced by inclusion of the
occasional pieces of juicy allegations about the targets alleged
misdemeanors or untrustworthiness in respect of relationships and
communication with people.
This appeals to the "gossip tendency" of human
beings as identified in the article quoted above. Mostly this is projection.
The objective is to manipulate the listeners or readers perceptions and
create a dependency so that the target comes to rely exclusively on the
schizoid and see the schizoid as the sole source of reliable information
whilst distrusting everyone else. Any person who is capable of exposing and
breaking the dependency is targeted with venom and will find their name
blackened at every opportunity.
When close to being outwitted and exposed, the schizoid feigns victimhood
and turns the focus on themselves - this is another example of manipulating
people through their emotion of guilt, e.g. sympathy, feeling sorry, etc.
all the while portraying their target as the villain of the piece. When the
target tries to explain the game, they are immediately labeled "paranoid".
Now, that is the "human to human" technique of the Schizoidal Psychopath.
You can extrapolate this out a bit and see that this is exactly how the
Media operates on a larger scale. It is a tried and true, tested Protocol
for "steering" human beings in the direction you want them to go, to get
them to think what you want them to think and ultimately, to get them to do
what you want them to do.
With the description of how this mind manipulation works, lets now take a
look at Protocol 12 where we will see how the above process has been
implemented on an enormous social scale.
What is the part played by the press to-day?
It serves to excite and inflame those passions which are needed for our
purpose or else it serves selfish ends of parties. It is often vapid,
unjust, mendacious, and the majority of the public have not the
slightest idea what ends the press really serves. We shall saddle and
bridle it with a tight curb: we shall do the same also with all
productions of the printing press, for where would be the sense of
getting rid of the attacks of the press if we remain targets for
pamphlets and books?
Now, keep in mind that the "we" above does NOT
refer to Jews! It refers to Psychopaths, Schizoidal, Essential, and other
types.
I am reminded of Lobaczewskis remark in
Ponerology:
I had to study subjects bordering on
psychology and psychopathology in order to answer the questions arising
from our observations; scientific neglect in these areas proved an
obstacle difficult to overcome. At the same time, someone guided by
special knowledge apparently vacated the libraries of anything we could
have found on the topic.
To really get the sense of how psychopaths know
they are different almost from birth, that they are truly a "different type
of creature" from normal human beings, you will
need to read Ponerology.
For the moment, however, whenever you read "we"
in this text, just substitute "psychopaths" and you will have the correct
understanding.
The pretext for stopping any publication
will be the alleged plea that it is agitating the public mind without
occasion or justification. I beg you to note that among those making
attacks upon us will also be organs established by us, but they will
attack exclusively points that we have pre-determined to alter.
NOT A SINGLE ANNOUNCEMENT WILL REACH THE PUBLIC WITHOUT OUR CONTROL.
Even now this is already being attained by us inasmuch as all news items
are received by a few agencies, in whose offices they are focused from
all parts of the world. These agencies will then be already entirely
ours and will give publicity only to what we dictate to them.
And if there should be any found who are desirous of writing against us,
they will not find any person eager to print their productions.
Literature and journalism are two of the most important educative
forces, and therefore our government will become proprietor of the
majority of the journals. This will neutralize the injurious influence
of the privately-owned press and will put us in possession of a
tremendous influence upon the public mind
. If we give permits for ten
journals, we shall ourselves found thirty, and so on in the same
proportion. This, however, must in no wise be suspected by the public.
For which reason all journals published by us will be of the most
opposite, in appearance, tendencies and opinions, thereby creating
confidence in us and bringing over to us quite unsuspicious opponents,
who will thus fall into our trap and be rendered harmless.
In the front rank will stand organs of an official character. They will
always stand guard over our interests, and therefore their influence
will be comparatively insignificant.
In the second rank will be the semi-official organs, whose part it will
be to attack the tepid and indifferent.
In the third rank we shall set up our own, to all appearance,
opposition, which, in at least one of its organs, will present what
looks like the very antipodes to us. Our real opponents at heart will
accept this simulated opposition as their own and will show us their
cards.
All our newspapers will be of all possible complexions aristocratic,
republican, revolutionary, even anarchical - for so long, of course, as
the constitution exists
. Like the Indian idol "Vishnu" they will have
a hundred hands, and every one of them will have a finger on any one of
the public opinions as required. When a pulse quickens these hands will
lead opinion in the direction of our aims, for an excited patient loses
all power of judgment and easily yields to suggestion. Those fools who
will think they are repeating the opinion of a newspaper of their own
camp will be repeating our opinion or any opinion that seems desirable
for us. In the vain belief that they are following the organ of their
party they will, in fact, follow the flag which we hang out for them.
In order to direct our newspaper militia in this sense we must take
special and minute care in organizing this matter. Under the title of
central department of the press we shall institute literary gatherings
at which our agents will without attracting attention issue the orders
and watchwords of the day. By discussing and controverting, but always
superficially, without touching the essence of the matter, our organs
will carry on a sham fight fusillade with the official newspapers solely
for the purpose of giving occasion for us to express ourselves more
fully than could well be done from the outset in official announcements,
whenever, of course, that is to our advantage.
These attacks upon us will also serve another purpose, namely, that our
subjects will be convinced to the existence of full freedom of speech
and so give our agents an occasion to affirm that all organs which
oppose us are empty babblers, since they are incapable of finding any
substantial objections to our orders. only lies printed
Methods of organization like these, imperceptible to the public eye but
absolutely sure, are the best calculated to succeed in bringing the
attention and the confidence of the public to the side of our
government.
Thanks to such methods we shall be in a position as from time to time
may be required, to excite or to tranquillize the public mind on
political questions, to persuade or to confuse, printing now truth, now
lies, facts or their contradictions, according as they may be well or
ill received, always very cautiously feeling our ground before stepping
upon it
We shall have a sure triumph over our opponents since they will not have
at their disposition organs of the press in which they can give full and
final expression to their views owing to the aforesaid methods of
dealing with the press. We shall not even need to refute them except
very superficially.
Trial shots like these, fired by us in the third rank of our press, in
case of need, will be energetically refuted by us in our semi-official
organs.
Even nowadays, already, to take only the French press, there are forms
which reveal masonic solidarity in acting on the watchword: all organs
of the press are bound together by professional secrecy; like the augurs
of old, not one of their numbers will give away the secret of his
sources of information unless it be resolved to make announcement of
them. Not one journalist will venture to betray this secret, for not one
of them is ever admitted to practice literature unless his whole past
has some disgraceful sore or other
. These sores would be immediately
revealed.
So long as they remain the secret of a few
the prestige of the journalist attacks the majority of the country - the
mob follow after him with enthusiasm.
Notice again that the point I want to make here
is that the most Schizoidal thing about the above is that it was a
"doctrine" attributed to Jews when it is actually a document of
Psychopathy and depicts the thinking of such Characteropaths of
any race, creed, color, national or religious background, in any time or
place.
And our problem is that, at present, we have
just such individuals in positions of power in the United States and
possibly/probably other countries, though none so obvious and blatant at the
moment as the Neocons and their Zionist bedfellows.
The United States is a Pathocracy, pure and simple. It has been taken
over by individuals with clearly delineated psychological defects, and they
have been able to achieve these positions because the psychological
knowledge of the masses of Americans is deficient.
Let me quote Lobaczewski on this point:
The first researchers attracted by the idea
of objectively understanding this phenomenon initially failed to
perceive the role of characteropathic personalities in the genesis of
pathocracy. However, when we attempt to reconstruct the early phase of
said genesis, we must acknowledge that characteropaths played a
significant role in this process.
We already know
how their defective
experiential and thought patterns take hold in human minds, insidiously
destroying their way of reasoning and their ability to utilize their
healthy common sense. This role has also proved essential because their
activities as fanatical leaders or spellbinders in various ideologies
open the door to psychopathic individuals and the view of the world they
want to impose.
In the ponerogenic process of the pathocratic phenomenon,
characteropathic individuals adopt ideologies created by doctrinaire,
often schizoidal people, recast them into an active propaganda form, and
disseminate it with pathological egotism and paranoid intolerance for
any philosophies which may differ from their own. They also inspire
further transformation of this ideology into its pathological
counterpart. Something which had a doctrinaire character and circulated
in numerically limited groups is now activated at societal level, thanks
to their spellbinding possibilities.
It also appears that this process tends to intensify with time; initial
activities are undertaken by persons with milder characteropathic
features, who are easily able to hide their aberrations from others.
Paranoid individuals thereupon become principally active. Toward the end
of the process, an individual with frontal characteropathy and the
highest degree of pathological egotism can easily take over leadership.
And so, the conclusion is, at this point, that the Media must be retaken
before anyone can do anything at all. It is through the media that
America has been subjugated and it is through the Media that Normal
People can reclaim their minds.
How to do it?
Ah, thats an interesting question. Indeed,
we have ideas as I have mentioned before. But we cannot reveal all of
them or, of a certainty, the Pathocrats would find a way to circumvent
us. Let me just give a small hint: Remember the
Pentagon Strike Flash
Presentation? Well, by now it has been viewed by over 500 MILLION people
and still going like wildfire.
The reason for this was because the video
struck a chord of resonance in those millions of people. We intend, as
part of our Media Reclamation Project, to produce more and better videos
that can be quickly and easily shared person to person. But our plans
include more than this
and with funding, we can do it.
Again, please donate to this project today
because we dont have much time left before the Neocons take humanity
where none of us want to go.
