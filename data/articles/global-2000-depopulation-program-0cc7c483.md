How Global 2000 Came into Being
This Awareness indicates this as associated with the Global 2000 plan of diminishing the population on the Earth.
This Awareness indicates that this plan was devised some time back, approximately 10 years previously, and has been in development for some time. This Awareness indicates that this as having certain justification from a particular viewpoint, if entities can accept such justification.
This Awareness indicates that in looking at this from the viewpoint of the world planners, (those who manipulate the masses), to understand their thinking, (not to condone their thinking); this Awareness wishes you to give at this time, the scenario of why and how they came to this conclusion. This Awareness indicates that the resources of the Earth are quickly being depleted by the consumers of the Earth, who are multiplying at alarming rates, mushrooming in terms of population growth so that proportionally, they are increasing in numbers in quantum leaps. The resources on Earth, being in limited supply, are being depleted by these increasing number of entities, of hungry and desirous beings who, to the world planners, are of little more significance than numbers on a computer.
This Awareness indicates that the use of these entities, the labor force of millions and billions of laborers to create cities, highways, homes, parks, waterways, ships, trains, airplanes, vehicles, to service and create these systems; the use of these many laborers to create such wealth and civilization has essentially run its course, and now machines, or few laborers are necessary for the maintenance of that which has already been created; and further creations are only necessary to accommodate the increasing population which is depleting the resources, such as food and oil.
This Awareness indicates that these world planners, therefore, see that to now reduce the population, rid the Earth of approximately 3 billion entities, would be an economic move that would leave a kind of paradise for those remaining, whereby all the fruits of labor from those entities now removed would fall to those who remain, whereby each nation around the world would have its own cities, its own resources in plentiful supply, and the choice of many places to go and to be. This Awareness indicates these entities would inherit the Earth with all its goodies.
This Awareness indicates that these world planners see that the alternative would be to watch the population continue to grow, to develop from 4 billion (in 1984) to 7 billion within approximately 20 years, From 7 billion, the energies would be depleted much more quickly, starvation would follow, chaos and social strive would follow, and still population would continue to rise, unless some program were developed to stop the population growth.
This Awareness indicates that the world planners see the future as being black if they do not take some drastic action to limit population growth; and yet they see little efforts by those third world countries to take such action, to educate the people to limit the population growth. This Awareness indicates that therefore, they see the necessity to bring about the destruction of these entities through famine, pestilence, biological warfare.
This Awareness indicates that this concept was briefly mentioned in the movie called Executive Action, that which dealt with the fictionalized version of the assassination of John Kennedy, wherein it was described in terms of the necessity to rid the world of undesirables in the future. This Awareness indicates that this program as that which has been planned, and has been put into operation in various ways, and which is growing in momentum.
This Awareness indicates that the Medical Association is involved, the governments of many nations are involved.
