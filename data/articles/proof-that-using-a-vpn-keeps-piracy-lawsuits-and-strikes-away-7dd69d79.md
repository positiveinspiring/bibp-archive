VPNs are used by thousands of people every day
to keep their online activities private and as long as their provider
doesn't log, the theory is that no third party will be able to track a
person down from their IP address alone.
Thanks to information recently posted to the
ChillingEffects repository, we can now see real-life examples of VPN users
avoiding costly settlement disputes with anti-piracy companies.
US-based Internet service providers receive
DMCA
notices from movie and music companies when their customers share
copyrighted material without permission.
Since the ISPs are legally obliged to pass these
notices on to the supposed infringers, companies that try to turn piracy
into profit see this as a business opportunity.
One such outfit, US-based
Rightscorp, sends out
DMCA notices but tags settlement offers onto the end, thus managing to
request cash from an individual whose identity they do not know.
While this
helpfully circumvents the need to obtain a court order, as
reported yesterday Comcast has been stripping the settlement offers
away.
Another way people avoid these kinds of demands
is by using an anonymizing service such as a no-logging VPN service, such as
those
listed here. When these companies receive Rightscorp-style notices there
is nothing they can do with them, since they do not know the identity of the
user in question.
While VPNs work in theory, up until now there
has been little public proof that these services really do stop anti-piracy
outfits in their tracks. However, thanks to DMCA notices submitted to
Chilling Effects by
Proxy.sh, we now have evidence that users are avoiding
expensive copyright settlements by using a VPN.
The notice below shows a DMCA/settlement demand
from anti-piracy company CEG TEK sent on behalf of porn giant Manwin. In
addition to the standard takedown text it requires the user to log into
their systems and agree to a cash settlement to make a file-sharing lawsuit
disappear.
Of course, that's not going to happen because
the intended recipient was using
a no-log VPN.
After following the links and entering the
username and passwords detailed above, a TorrentFreak reader sent us the
following screenshots of the settlement offer itself.
At this point the user is given the opportunity
to enter more infringement notice details if they have them, with each
adding to the total settlement amount.
Once completed and following a click of the
'continue' button, a new page appears asking the alleged infringer to enter
his personal details and select a payment method.
Further settlement notices sent by CEG TEK on
behalf of other copyright holders including porn outfits Brazzers (1)
and Celestial (1), (2),
all reveal demands for cash.
Since none of these were passed onto the VPN
user, none of this companies will be receiving a penny.
Also of interest are several other notices sent
by,
...to VPN users.
While none of these ask for cash payment, these
companies are partners in the 'six
strikes' campaign currently underway in the United States. If the
individuals targeted by these notices had been using one of the
participating ISPs, they would have had a 'strike' placed against their
account.
Since they were using a no-logging VPN, the
notices dropped into a black hole.
