Introduction
A mysterious trillion dollar lawsuit filed on November 23, 2011 in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, claims that 134.5
billion dollars worth of gold was secretly given to the U.S. government in
the mid-1930s by the then Nationalist government of China for safekeeping.
[1]
The lawsuit claims that 1934 U.S. Federal Reserve notes were issued to
the Chinese government, and the gold transferred to the Federal Reserve
Bank. [2]
It is claimed that a total sum of almost one trillion dollars
representing both the principal and accumulated interest of the 1934 Federal
Reserve notes was fraudulently taken from the plaintiff, Neil Keenan, an
agent for the owners, a mysterious Asian entity called The Dragon Family.
What makes the lawsuit worth paying attention to is that involves the
unresolved June 2009 case of two Japanese citizens caught on a train in
Italy while traveling to Switzerland with 134.5 billion dollars in US
Federal Reserve notes, bonds and other financial instruments. [3]
The U.S. District Court lawsuit supports claims by
David Guyatt, author of
The Secret Gold Treaty, that missing World War II era national gold reserves
have been intentionally kept out of public circulation (black gold).
Furthermore, the lawsuit reveals a coordinated international effort to
launder, trade and defraud owners or investors of bonds and other financial
instruments issued against the black gold.
At the heart of this
internationally coordinated effort, according to Guyatt, is
the Bilderberg
Group - which in 1954 played a key role in the passage of a Secret Gold
Treaty. What this paper will show is that what lies behind the Bilderberg
Groups involvement with black gold is to provide long-term funding for a
globally coordinated second Manhattan Project.
The ultimate goal of this
globally coordinated project is to comprehensively deal with a subject so
vast and complex as to dwarf the resources of any one nation -
extraterrestrial life and technology.
U.S. District Court
Lawsuit involving the Dragon Family
The U.S. District Court lawsuit has aroused considerable controversy over
its authenticity and the ownership of the 134.5 billion in Federal Reserve
notes, bonds and other financial instruments.
The lawsuit was filed by
William Mulligan Jr and Justin Gardner from Bleakley Platt and Schmidt, a
reputable New York law firm. [4]
The principal plaintiff
in the lawsuit,
Neil Keenan, claims to have been defrauded by a number of official
government agencies and political figures including a little known
organization called the Office of International Treasury Control (OITC), and
its principal officers Dr
Ray Dam (President) and David Sale (Deputy Chief
of the Council for Cabinet of OITC).
On the other hand, Sale claims that
Keenan and his accomplices fraudulently gained possession of the bonds from
the OITC. Importantly, neither of the two parties contesting ownership of
the bonds dispute their validity.
Financial Instruments seized at Chiasso, Italy
The core claim of the November 2011 District Court filing is that the bonds
apprehended in Chiasso, Italy in June 2009 by the Italian financial police
were genuinely issued by the Roosevelt administration in exchange for gold
deposited by the Nationalist Government of China some time before the
Japanese invasion on July 7, 1937.
The lawsuit states:
Upon information and belief, between 1927 and 1938, as a result of
arrangements made between China and the United States, the United States
leased vast amounts of gold from the nationalist Chinese Government, known
as
Kuomintang.
During this period, China was partly occupied by Japanese
troops and there was a fear of China being overrun by the Japanese. [5]
The lawsuit goes on to claim that the 134.5 billion dollars of gold given to
the U.S. government was only a small percentage of the total gold held by
Chinas nationalist government, or the Kuomintang.
The total was estimated
to be thousands of trillions in value - which seems like an impossibly
high estimate given current knowledge of world gold reserves. According to
Wikipedia, 165,000 tons of gold are known to exist - at the current market
price of $1700 per ounce, this comes out to approximately 10 trillion U.S.
dollars.
Thousands of trillions would be gold reserves of approximately 20
million metric tons or more.
Whatever the total value of gold acquired during the millennia of Chinas
dynastic rulers it is reasonable to believe that much of it was successfully
hidden from Japan, and subsequently taken out of mainland China by the
Kuomintang prior to the Communist takeover in 1949.
According to
Benjamin Fulford (the former Asia bureau chief for Forbes Magazine from 1998-2005
before he became a spokesperson for the Dragon Family in 2007) the gold
transfer was secretly conducted by the U.S. Navy which in 1938 took
possession of the gold via seven destroyers to the U.S. mainland. [6]
These
events occurred in conformity with the 1934 Gold Act and President
Roosevelts 1933 Executive Order (6102) which prohibited private ownership
of gold, and instructed private citizens to sell all their gold to the
Federal Reserve Bank at a prescribed rate of $20.67.
Here is how the lawsuit describes the actual transfer of the gold and roles
played by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury in issuing the
financial instruments that were eventually seized in Chiasso, Italy:
following the promulgation in 1934 of the Gold Reserve Act, the law
required all bullion gold and gold coin to be surrendered to the Federal
Reserve
Foreign Gold held by the Treasury was also surrendered to and thus
leased to the Federal Reserve, which resulted in the issuance of the series
of 1934 Notes by the Federal Reserve.
These Dragon Family FRNs have never
been redeemed and, upon information and belief, the accrued interest was met
by the subsequent issue of certain 1968 series of Kennedy Bonds. [7]
The lawsuit then goes on to explain how Swiss banks acted as intermediaries:
this gold was documented into accounts through the Union Bank of
Switzerland, placed under protection of the Swiss Attorney General,
registered through the Swiss National Bank into the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) International Collateral Combined accounts and then from
within the BIS, blocked to form the Institutional Parent Registration
Accounts of the Federal Reserve System. [8]
Most important was the procedure for redeeming the Federal Reserve notes
which the lawsuit describes:
in order to effectuate this process, the Notes were printed to appear as
if they were not produced from official origin and bear obvious
imperfections, therefore easily deniable.
However, when proper procedures
are followed, the number of the Note and other linking identical data allows
ultimate authentication and verification through the Federal Reserve System
screening process
[9]
This apparently was why original press reports of the 134.5 billion seized
at Chiasso concluded they were forgeries.
The lawsuit describes the owners of the Federal Reserve bonds as follows:
The Dragon Family is, in fact, a highly secretive and informal organization
that operates between old families within China and Taiwan, above the
political divide of the two independent Chinese Governments. [10]
Later in the lawsuit, the old families are described as "group of Asians
of royal blood known as the Dragon Family - the remnants of Chinas former
Celestial Kingdom. [11]
The Dragon Family initially wanted to protect the
gold reserves entrusted to them from Japan and later communist authorities.
Currently headed by a mysterious General Haan, the Dragon Family had
unsuccessfully attempted to redeem the bonds over several years through
their signatory Yamaguchi.
The Dragon Family subsequently appointed
Neil
Keenan to take charge of the Bonds in early 2009 with the purpose of
lawfully redeeming them for,
a wide range of global humanitarian purposes.
At a certain point in complex negotiations, Keenan instructed the two
Japanese citizens - Akihiko Yamaguchi and Mitsuyoshi Watanabe acting as
couriers for The Dragon Family - to transport the bonds to the proper
Swiss banking authorities for their ultimate redemption.
The detention of
Watanabe and Yamagushi, and confiscation of the 134.5 billion in bonds by
the Italian financial police on the border town of Chiasso, according to the
lawsuit, was part of an elaborate attempt to steal the bonds by a host of
actors.
In addition to the Office of International Treasure Control and its
principal officers, the named targets of the lawsuit include,
-
the Italian
Financial Police
-
the Italian government and former Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi
-
the World Economic Forum and its banking head, Giancarlo Bruno
-
the
United Nations and its Secretary-General Ban Ki
Moon
David Sale and the
Office of International Treasury Control
The case outlined in the lawsuit is very complex and details what appears to
be an elaborate attempt to defraud Neil Keenan of bonds entrusted to him by
the Dragon Family.
Keenan is described as a US citizen currently residing in
Bulgaria who first come into contact with the Dragon Family in August 2008
due to his political connections, and assistance with bank contacts in
Cyprus.
The principal parties named in the lawsuit are,
-
Dr
Ray Dam and the
Office of International Treasury Control (OITC) which he founded
-
a senior OITC officer,
David Sale
-
Daniele Dal Bosco who is described as having gained
possession of the bonds in September 2009, and entering into an agreement
with the OITC
The lawsuit contests:
-
the execution of a written agreement between DAL BOSCO and defendants
OITC and SALE, with the full knowledge and authority of DAM, whereby DAL
BOSCO openly repudiated his duties as custodian of the DFFI [Dragon Family
Financial Instruments, e.g., Federal Reserve notes, etc., seized at Chiasso,
Italy];
-
the issuance of an illegal and utterly baseless Cease and Desist Order
under which OITC asserted the thoroughly and knowingly false proposition
that the DFFI was, in fact, in the lawful possession of the OITC, which has
acted for decades with impunity and under the asserted umbrella of
protection allegedly accorded by the United Nations. [12]
Prior to the lawsuit being filed in November 2011, David Sale gave a series
of interviews back on April 7, April 12 and May 10, 2011, on the popular
internet radio show, Rumormill News, Sale told the host Rayelan Allan, that
in 1995 the head of the OITC, Ray Dam, had been given exclusive rights to
the collateral accounts of all the gold secretly hidden during the World
War II era, by descendents of a world wide association of exiled royal
families - the Hierarchy. [13]
Included in the list of royal families
named by Sale are the descendents of the Hapsburgs, Savoy, Romanovs and many
other royal families who collectively owned, according to Sale, two million
metric tons of gold.
According to Sale, the Royal Families handed over
ownership of the collateral accounts once they realized that redemption of
the 50 year bonds making up the collateral accounts would be challenged by
powerful financial institutions from around the world.
Dr Ray Dam, also an
alleged royal family descendent, was tasked with the job of redeeming the
bonds for the purposes of world wide humanitarian projects.
The
OITC website
explains:
On January 20th 1995, Dr. Ray C. Dam was appointed International Treasury
Controller, and Legal Heir and Owner of the Combined International
Collateral Accounts [hidden national gold reserves] of the Global Debt
Facility, with full authority and dispositional control of same, under Legal
Decadency RCD 1088, executed by the Nations of the World.
Also established
on January 20, 1995 was The Office of International Treasury Control, as the
management, administrative and operations organization for His Excellency,
Dr. Ray C. Dam. [14]
According to Sale, the Federal Reserve bonds discovered at Chiasso Italy in
June 2009, are part of the collateral accounts entrusted to the OITC, and
were stolen by Keenan.
Sale further claims that he has documentation that
Neil Keenan is in fact a CIA official who in collaboration with another CIA
agent that had infiltrated the OITC, Keith Scott, had stolen the bonds from
the OITC.
How credible is David Sale?
His core claim that Ray Dam was entrusted with
all the collateral accounts of national gold reserves historically
taken/stolen from royal families sounds fanciful. Yet Sales credibility is
vouched for by Rayelan Allan who along with her ex-husband, Gunther
Russbacher, was involved in locating and repatriating missing national gold
reserves for several decades.
Russbacher is of Austrian descent and his
father was in Nazi Intelligence, and emmigrated to the US after the war, in
1954. Allan claims to have assisted Russbacher in the secret relocation of
Austrian national gold reserves looted by NAZI Germany, from the Philippines
back to Austria in 1994.
She provided documentation concerning the Austrian
gold transfer to the investigative journalist David Guyatt, author of the
first book dealing with looted and missing national gold reserves, The
Secret Gold Treaty (2000). [15]
Guyatt found Russbacher and Allan to be credible and described in some
detail their role in relocating Austrian gold reserves which he described as
a single transfer of 500 metric tons, though Allan claimed the total was
much higher with multiple transfers (totaling an astonishing 500,000 metric
tons).
According to Allan, the OITC is authentic and Sale is telling the
truth in exposing Neil Keenan as a CIA operative trying to steal the Federal
Reserve bonds discovered by Italian authorities in June 2009. [See
update 1/18/12 below]
What certainly doesnt help Keenans lawsuit is
the claim that somehow Dal Bosco gained possession of the Dragon Family
Financial Instruments (DFFI) in September 2009.
If the DFFI were seized by
the Italian authorities in June 2009, how did Dal Bosco gain possession
three months later before handing them off to the OITC?
This is not
explained in the lawsuit, and the reader is left to assume that the Italian
Financial police somehow handed the Federal Reserve notes and bonds seized
at Chiasso to Dal Bosco.
Why and how is not clearly explained in the
lawsuit, making it difficult to imagine that the lawsuit will succeed. So
while the lawsuit appears genuine enough and was lodged by a reputable law
firm, its failure to explain the alleged transfer of the financial
instruments seized at Chiasso into Dal Boscos possession does raise
questions over the legal strategy behind the lawsuit.
On the other hand, Keenans authenticity and the legitimacy of the lawsuit
is supported by Benjamin Fulford and D. Wilcock, who runs the blog site, Divine Cosmos.
[16]
In an interview, Fulford claimed
that 85% of the worlds gold was acquired over the millennia by Chinas
dynastic rulers. [17]
If the worlds known gold reserves of 165,000 metric
tones is 15% of the real figure, that means that approximately one million
metric tons of
missing gold reserves exist elsewhere. Much of this missing
gold allegedly remains under the control of the Dragon Family whose
interests Keenan was representing in the case of the Chiasso incident.
If
the Keenans account in the lawsuit is accurate, the Chinese gold
transferred to the US Federal Reserve Bank in the mid-1930s is only the tip
of the iceberg. Entrusting the Federal Reserve notes and bonds to Keenan
appears to have been calculated gamble.
In fact, Wilcock (and Fulford)
refers to the actions of the Dragon Family as being an elaborate sting
operation. [18]
They were fully aware that their bonds would very likely be
taken from Keenan at some point, but believed that the eventual lawsuit
would be the catalyst for the rest of the world learning about the way in
which Chinas and other national gold reserves have been secretly taken out
of circulation for decades.
As mentioned earlier, Keenans account is strongly challenged by David Sale,
Ray Dam, and the OITC who have been trying since 1995 to bring attention to
the way in which national gold reserves were secretly taken out of
circulation since the Second World War era.
Along with Rayelan Allan who
with her former husband, Gunther Russbacher, were also involved in efforts
to bring public attention to missing national gold reserves, it is very
possible that Keenan is part of an officially sanctioned attempt to co-opt
and publicize such efforts; or he may simply be part of a Dragon Family
sting operation to publicize the history behind the bonds as suggested by
Fulford.
The Secret Gold Treaty
& 1954 Bilderberg Meeting
Regardless of the controversy over ownership of Federal Reserve bonds behind
the trillion dollar lawsuit, both Keenan/Dragon Family and Sale/OITC agree
over the bonds authenticity.
Most importantly, both parties agree that the
bonds were issued by the US Federal Reserve bank against gold reserves
leased to it during the Second World War era.
The national gold reserves of
nationalist China, in Keenans/Dragon Family lawsuit version of historic
events (somewhere in the range from one to 20 million tons); or the gold of
most of the worlds exiled royal families in the Sale/OITC version of events
(two million tons) dwarf in size the known world gold reserves of 165,000
tons.
The most telling fact to emerge from the lawsuit is that the vast
majority of the worlds gold has been hidden away from public knowledge and
scrutiny for decades.
As David Guyatt explains it back in 2000:
the full story of the nature of gold has yet to be told, and my guess is
that it will remain hermetically sealed amongst the few for a very long time
to come. Two things are certain, however. The historical official mining
figures for gold are patently false and have been knowingly fabricated and
thrust on an unsuspecting public.
Second, and leading on from this, it is,
therefore, evident that gold is not at all rare. Current statistics show
above- ground stocks of the metal to total about 140,000 metric tones. The
reality is far, far higher and, in all probability, is well in excess of one
million tonnes.
I doubt anyone really knows for certain, owing to the fact
that so much is still buried in the Philippines and elsewhere in Southeast
Asia that tallying it all up is impossible - even to this day. [19]
his historic gold deception can only have been achieved by the concerted
efforts of central banks with the approval of senior government officials
from around the world in order to manipulate national monetary policies.
Guyatt succinctly describes the situation:
As we shall see, it is almost certainly the case that these "others" are a
group of nations who were party to a secret agreement to exert control over
plundered World War II gold and other assets and to ensure these did not
enter the banking system or otherwise be utilised without such nations
approval. [20]
After reviewing a number of documents describing the movement of Gold, David
Guyatt concludes that the secret agreement happened in 1954:
In the light of the foregoing, it is hard not to conclude that some form of
secret treaty may well have been signed in 1954 that involved the recovery
of World War II plunder - both European and Asian - and that a portion of
it was subsequently used in US military and intelligence "black operations."
[21]
As to where this secret treaty was negotiated and even signed Guyatt settles
on the first ever Bilderburg meeting:
Whatever else might have happened in 1954
one event cannot be overlooked.
This was the first ever meeting of the Bilderberg group during 29-31 May
1954. That first meeting was dominated by American, British and then German
participants who filled 36 of the available 67 slots. [22]
The 1954 Bilderberg meeting had multiple reasons to convene.
The public
justification was that it was held to promote political and economic
cooperation between Europe and North America as the best defense to what was
now perceived as the long term threat of communism. To that end, prominent
business and political leaders have been regularly invited to Bilderberg
Group on an annual basis to discuss ways of coordinating national policies
and anticipating global trends.
The annual meetings of some of the worlds
most powerful public figures has naturally led to much curiosity over the Bilderberg Groups origins and goals.
Here is how best selling author Daniel Estulin describes the Bilderberg Group:
In 1954, the most powerful men in the world met for the time under the
auspices of the Dutch royal crown and the Rockefeller family at the
luxurious Hotel Bilderberg in the small Dutch town of Oosterbeek. For an
entire weekend, they debated the future of the world.
When it was over, they
decide to meet once every year to exchange ideas and analyze international
affairs. They named themselves the Bilderberg Group. [23]
Estulin goes on to conclude that since 1954, the Bilderberg Group has become
a shadow world government:
they have gathered yearly in a luxurious hotel somewhere in the world to
try to decide the future of humanity
the Bilderberg Group has grown beyond
its idealistic beginnings to become a shadow world government, which decides
in total secrecy at annual meetings how their plans are to be carried out.
They threaten to take away our right to direct our own destinies. [24]
Among the many notable individuals involved with Bilderberg Group meetings
over the decades since its formation, Estulin gives special mention to the
role of
Henry Kissinger who was a protégé of
the Rockefeller brothers.
Estulin describes some of Kissingers work for the Rockefellers and the
Bilderberg Group since the 1960s:
As far back as the mid-1960s, the Bilderbergers placed Kissinger in charge
of a small group consisting of James Schlesinger, Alexander Haig and Daniel
Ellsberg. Working with them was the Institute of Policy Studies chief
theoretician, Noam Chomsky
In the 60s, Kissingers team and Chomsky were
creating the New Left" as a grassroots movement in the U.S. to engender
strife and unrest. [25]
Later in the 1970s, Estulin describes Kissingers role in the removal of
President Nixon:
Kissinger was responsible for brainwashing and confusing President Nixon
With Nixons resignation, the Bilderbergs finally saw their president,
Gerald Ford, move into the White House. The New World Orders yes man took
direct orders from Henry Kissinger, an agent of David Rockefeller, a servant
to the Bilderbergers. [26]
While Estulin identifies some of the Bilderberg Groups key players, he only
captures the surface layer of the Bilderberg Groups origins and goals.
The deeper secret justification for the Bilderberg Groups creation was to
encourage global cooperation in response to a perceived long term threat
known to the key actors in forming the Bilderberg Group: the Rockefeller
brothers; Prince Bernard of the Netherlands; and a key Rockefeller protégé,
Henry Kissinger.
This long term threat was only shared on a need-to-know
basis, and emanated from World War II events involving Nazi Germanys
advanced technology programs.
Events which Nelson Rockefeller and Kissinger
were deeply involved - the existence of extraterrestrial life and
technology.
Project Paperclip and
advanced Nazi technology
There is significant evidence that Nazi Germany had partially succeeded in
developing highly advanced technologies gathered from extraterrestrial
sources.
The first source were a number of expeditions by Nazi SS Ahnenerbe
research teams that searched for ancient advanced technologies buried remote
locations such as Tibet, or knowledge recorded in historical texts. [27]
Authors such as
Zecharia Sitchin,
Erich Von Daniken and others have cited
extensive historical evidence of ancient astronauts and the knowledge they
left behind. [28]
The second source was reverse engineering downed extraterrestrial craft that
had been discovered by Nazi authorities in the mid 1930s. [29]
Lt Colonel
Phillip Corso, who was a senior officer in charge of reverse engineering
extraterrestrial technology during the Eisenhower and Kennedy
administrations, gave support to such an event in an interview:
There were crashes elsewhere, and they [the Germans] gathered material too.
The Germans were working on it. They didnt solve the propulsion system.
They did a lot of experiments on flying saucers. They had one that went up
to 12,000 feet.
But where all, we and they, missed out was on the guidance
system. In R&D we began to realize that this being [an extraterrestrial] was
part of the guidance system, part of the apparatus himself, or itself, as it
had no sexual organs." [30]
The partly successful efforts by top Nazi scientists in understanding
ancient historical texts discussing advanced technologies, and reverse
engineering extraterrestrial technology was a major factor in
Nazi Germanys
advanced weapons technology program.
This led to the Nazis prolonging the
war effort in order to fully deploy these new weapons systems.
This is
confirmed by Captain Edward Ruppelt who was the initial Chief Investigator
for US Air Force Project Bluebook:
"When WWII ended, the Germans had several
radical types of aircraft and guided missiles under development. The
majority were in the most preliminary stages, but they were the only known
craft that could even approach the performance of objects reported to UFO
observers
" [31]
As the Second World War drew to a close with the inevitable defeat of Nazi
Germany, the Nazi SS began to secretly remove its most advanced
technologies, projects and scientists to sympathetic countries in Latin
America.
Importantly, the relocation of these advanced technology projects
was also accompanied by the movement of looted Nazi gold reserves, as David Guyatt explains in his book, The Secret Gold Treaty:
Russbacher told the BBC journalist that huge quantities of Nazi gold had
been shipped to South America, via Spain, just prior to the close of World
War II. The loot had sat in South America for a number of years, but as soon
as its existence became known to Israeli intelligence the plunder was
immediately transferred to the Philippines and hidden, Russbacher said. [32]
President Roosevelt appointed Nelson Rockefeller to the position of
Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in the Office of Inter-American
Affairs in 1940.
Rockefeller was responsible for a program of US cooperation
with South American nations, and to counter rising Nazi influence in the
region. With the help of the FBI which at the time had field offices in
South and Central America, Rockefeller led counter-intelligence operations
in order to find the relocated Nazi technology projects and the looted gold.
While Rockefeller was dealing with Nazis in South America during the Second
World War, in Europe, a top secret effort to repatriate Nazi scientists in
order to utilize their expertise was begun by US Armys Counter Intelligence
Corps.
Operation Paperclip involved the removal of hundreds of Nazi
scientists to the well funded military-scientific laboratories created to
produce weapons for the war effort. [33]
Henry Kissinger and
Operation Paperclip
A little known figure in Operation Paperclip was a young German speaking
US Army intelligence officer with a German Jewish background -
Henry
Kissinger.
Kissinger was born in Fuerth, Germany on May 27, 1923, and served
in the Army Counterintelligence Corps from 1943-46.
At the close of World
War II, he stayed on active duty in occupied West Germany.
He was assigned
to the 970th Counter Intelligence Corps Detachment, among whose official
functions included the recruitment of ex-Nazi intelligence officers for
anti-Soviet operations inside the Soviet bloc. [34]
Kissingers detachment,
in reality, was playing a key role in Operation Paperclip - a role that
would mark him out in military intelligence circles as someone who had the
keen intellect and strategic thinking abilities that could handle the most
important strategic policy issue facing the US - how best to respond to an
undisclosed extraterrestrial presence. [35]
Kissinger returned to the US, and in 1947 began his university education as
an undergraduate at Harvard University. Kissinger, however, retained his
ties to the military, as a Captain in the Military Intelligence Reserves.
This enabled him to continue to play a role in issues pertaining to the
extraterrestrial presence as the policy at the highest level of the Truman
administration was being developed.
By 1950, Kissinger was now a graduate
student and was working part time for the Department of Defense. He
regularly commuted to Washington - as a consultant to its Operations
Research Office which was under the direct control of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
The Operations Research Office officially conducted highly
classified studies on such topics as the utilization of former German
operatives and Nazi partisan supporters in CIA clandestine activities.
Kissingers official duties were once again a cover for his role in
coordinating the recruitment and utilization of former Nazi scientists in
clandestine projects involving the
reverse engineering of extraterrestrial
technology.
In I952, after completing his PhD, Kissinger became a consultant to the
director of the Psychological Strategy Board, an operating arm of the
National Security Council for covert psychological and paramilitary
operations.
Kissingers role expanded to dealing with the extensive policy
issues surrounding the
extraterrestrial presence. Kissingers inside
knowledge of Operation Paperclip and the extraterrestrial presence, combined
with his strategic thinking abilities, marked him as someone who would
rapidly assume a prominent position in the decision making hierarchy.
In 1953, President Eisenhower chose Nelson Rockefeller to be in charge of
reorganizing the U.S. Federal government.
Rockefeller from 1953-59 was
Chairman of the Presidents Advisory Committee on Government Organization.
In addition, in 1954 Eisenhower appointed Rockefeller his Special Assistant
for Cold War Planning, a position that officially involved the monitoring
and approval of covert CIA operations.
This was a cover for Rockefellers
true role in coordinating U.S. and allied response to the presence of
extraterrestrial life and technology. [36]
Soon after his appointments to the Eisenhower administration, Rockefeller
met with Kissinger and became greatly impressed by the latters intellect
and strategic insights.
This is what Kissinger said about his 1954 meeting
with Rockefeller 25 years later in a Eulogy Kissinger gave for Rockefeller
in 1979:
That Nelson Rockefeller is dead is both shattering and nearly inconceivable.
One thought him indestructible, so overpowering was he in his energy, warmth
and his deep faith in mans inherent goodness. For twenty-five years, he had
been my friend, my older brother, my inspiration and my teacher.
I first met Nelson Rockefeller when, as an assistant to the President, he
called me, a graduate student, to join one of the panels of experts he was
forever setting up to ponder the nations future. He entered the room
slapping backs, calling each of us by the best approximation to our first
name that he could remember, at once outgoing and remote.
Intoxicated by the
proximity of power, all of us sought to impress him with our practical
acumen and offered tactical advice on how to manipulate events. [37]
Kissingers role in the clandestine operations, his close relationship with
Nelson Rockefeller, his intellectual abilities, all combined to lead to a
steady increase in his influence.
Rockefeller and others running clandestine
organizations understood the danger in not coordinating clandestine policy
towards extraterrestrial life and technology, with the more conventional
foreign policy issues that were the focus of public attention. They were
acutely aware of the potential threat posed by an extraterrestrial presence
whose technological capacities far exceeded humanitys.
The very first Bilderberg meeting in May 1954 was set up with all these considerations in
mind. Most importantly, however, was the fact that the first Bilderberg
meeting occurred soon after another major event that is yet to be disclosed
to the public.
That is President
Eisenhowers alleged meeting with a
delegation of extraterrestrials at Edwards Air Force base in February 1954.
A number of whistleblowers have claimed to have either directly witnessed,
or seen documents/film of one of the most important diplomatic meetings ever
held in human history. [38] The core story is that President Eisenhower
secretly traveled to Edwards AFB to meet with a delegation of
extraterrestrials over the weekend of February 19-20, 1954 in a final
attempt by the latter to halt Americas thermonuclear weapons program.
Apparently, the extraterrestrial delegation wanted to persuade Eisenhower to
use his personal authority to put an end to the development of the Hydrogen
bomb whose destructive capacities far exceeded the more primitive nuclear
fission bombs used on Japan.
The extraterrestrials offered to help the U.S.
develop spiritually and ethically before introducing advanced technologies
that could also be used for weapons of mass destruction. Eisenhowers
national security team was firmly opposed to the extraterrestrials
overtures.
This is how one alleged witness described the scene and the
conflict between Eisenhowers national security advisors:
My dear friends:
I have just returned from Muroc [Edwards Air Force Base].
The report is true - devastatingly true!
When we were allowed to enter
the restricted section (after about six hours in which we were checked on
every possible item, event, incident and aspect of our personal and public
lives), I had the distinct feeling that the world had come to an end with
fantastic realism.
For I have never seen so many human beings in a state of
complete collapse and confusion, as they realized that their own world had
indeed ended with such finality as to beggar description. The reality of the
other plane aeroforms is now and forever removed from the realms of
speculation and made a rather painful part of the consciousness of every
responsible scientific and political group
President Eisenhower, as you
may already know, was spirited over to Muroc one night during his visit to
Palm Springs recently. And it is my conviction that he will ignore the
terrific conflict between the various 'authorities' and go directly to the
people via radio and television - if the impasse continues much longer.
From what I could gather, an official statement to the country is being
prepared for delivery about the middle of May. [39]
The date of May for Eisenhowers tentative extraterrestrial disclosure
announcement is an important clue to the timetable decision makers were
using to decide what to do about the extraterrestrials concerns over nuclear
weapons.
The diplomatic meeting failed and less than two weeks later,
America tested its largest ever hydrogen bomb on March 1, 1954 - the Bravo
Tests 15 megaton yield was 1000 times more destructive than the bomb used
at Hiroshima.
Rather than move forward with a May 1954 Disclosure
announcement, Eisenhower instead approved keeping the existence of
extraterrestrial life a closely guarded secret.
In May 1954, what happened
instead was approval for a meeting of global elites under the auspices of
the Rockefeller family - the very first Bilderberg meeting:
Recordings from the first Bilderberg meeting
Oosterbeek, Netherlands, 1954
Bilderberg Group and
Global Manhattan Project
The main task of
the Bilderberg Group was to coordinate the developed
nations of the world so that any information gained by any nation pertaining
to extraterrestrial life and technology was to be sent to the right place
for research and development.
A highly secretive second Manhattan project
that had begun in the United States under President Truman to deal with the
extraterrestrial presence was expanded to include other nations in a
globally coordinated effort.
Eisenhowers election in November 1952, offered
his chief supporters,
the Rockefeller Family, the opportunity to have
greater corporate involvement in the now secret Global Manhattan Project.
Nelson (left) & David Rockefeller
The Rockefeller brothers (Nelson and David) along with
Henry Kissinger, were
instrumental in shaping the Eisenhower governments response to the
extraterrestrial presence using Cold War covert operations as a cover, and
helping set up the Bilderberg Group for that purpose.
The Bilderberg Group
would meet to coordinate national policies so that humanity would have the
best chance of surviving the challenges posed by visitation of different
extraterrestrial factions with unknown agendas.
A vital part of the Bilderberg Group agenda was to ensure that the global
media and national legislatures would not learn about the extraterrestrial
presence, or of the coordinated national contributions to a globally
coordinated Manhattan Project. Funding a Global Manhattan Project, let alone
the U.S. element that was at its core would be a monumental task.
The Global Manhattan Project would cost hundreds of billions in the 1950s, and
eventually grow to trillions to fund each year.
It would have to be funded
in a way that the mass media and national legislatures would not discover
what was happening. More importantly, a funding mechanism would need to be
found that was reliable and could last for decades if some of the more
conventional sources were exposed and/or dried up.
Funding the Global
Manhattan Project entirely through national budgets would
not work since the enormous sums required would be too obvious for any
scrutinizing expenditures by public institutions. National budgets could
only supply a portion of the total funds committed by any nation to
the global Manhattan project.
[40]
Nor would funding the global Manhattan
project entirely from corporations controlled by political and social elites
from around the world suffice. Company shareholders would revolt if too much
money disappeared for development purposes into unknown corporate programs
thereby threatening dividends and stock value.
While extraterrestrial
technologies offered fantastic possibilities for future revenue, the market
release of these were subject to national security concerns that would
override company profit sheets.
Even the largest multinational corporations
where in no position to commit billions of dollars for research and
development purposes without any timetable for when their investments would
see the light of day in a market release.
The most plausible long term funding mechanism would have to be hidden or
black in the sense that it was not part of the publicly identified revenue
belonging to national governments or major multinational corporations. The
solution would be to significantly expand the unofficial black budget that
had been created during the Truman administration by the creation of the
CIA.
The CIA is unique among U.S. departments in that it can receive or
transmit revenue between U.S. departments without regard to law:
any other Government agency is authorized to transfer to or receive from
the Agency such sums without regard to any provisions of law limiting or
prohibiting transfers between appropriations.
Sums
transferred to the Agency in accordance with this paragraph may be expended
for the purposes and under the authority of sections 403a to 403s of this
title without regard to limitations of appropriations from which
transferred. [41]
Basically, the 1949 CIA Act gave the CIA the legal cover to launder money
through different government departments and agencies.
The CIA immediately
began setting up a host of unconventional funding sources for its covert
operations.
Over the decades, the CIAs unofficial black budget would grow spectacularly
to where in the years 1998-2000, an average of 1.7 trillion dollars was
being funneled into the U.S. Department of Defense for funding the deep
black projects set up to deal with extraterrestrial presence.
What follows
is a table summarizing the accounting irregularities found in the Dept of
Defense which are the tell-tale signs of CIA money laundered through the DoD
for deep black projects and covert operations.
Table 1

Entries 1998-2000
The funding strategies used by the CIA,
...were not a long term solution for funding the
Global Manhattan Project.
If any of these funding methods were publicly exposed or dried up
in some way, the Global Manhattan Project could be at risk. Nor were the
CIAs funding methods easily transferable to the intelligence agencies of
other nations. So a more long term global funding mechanism was developed at
the first ever Bilderberg Group meeting.
This is the Secret Gold Treaty
first exposed by David Guyatt in 2000, and linked to the Bilderberg Groups
establishment.
The enormous sums of gold that had been hoarded and moved during the Second
World War into different locations in Asia, Switzerland and South America
offered an almost unlimited means of international funding for a globally
coordinated Manhattan Project.
The Bilderberg Group was the forum whereby the Secret Gold Treaty was
negotiated and implemented so that a Global Manhattan Project in response to
the extraterrestrial presence could be funded for decades, if not centuries,
without the general public learning of its existence.
Guyatt reached a
similar conclusion about the purpose of the Gold Treaty negotiated in 1954,
most likely at the Bilderberg conference:
In the light of the foregoing, it is hard not to conclude that some form of
secret treaty may well have been signed in 1954 that involved the recovery
of World War II plunder - both European and Asian - and that a portion of
it was subsequently used in US military and intelligence "black operations."
[45]
Guyatt claims that in 1972, another secret meeting occurred to formalize the
1954 meeting given changes in the international system with the growing
international prominence of Asian economies:
The answer to this enigma appears to reside in a secret meeting held in 1972
in which 48 nations (or representatives from 48 nations) participated that
formalized an earlier informal agreement (dare I say a "Secret Treaty?") to
control and "use" the metal plundered during World War II.
By all accounts,
bullion banks, central banks, and also refineries have since joined in this
arrangement and have formed an unofficial "club" to police and control the
black gold that they henceforward designated as being on "vacation."
[46]
Basically, as Guyatt first revealed, the amount of publicly known and
tradable gold would be contrived by deflating the amount of historically
mined gold to the current estimate of 165 thousand tons.
In reality, the
amount of black gold greatly exceeded this by as much as a factor of a 100
or even more. Keeping Asias and Europes black gold off the books would
offer a cache of gold that could be moved, traded and/or liquidated in ways
that would generate enormous sums for different national intelligence
agencies.
According to Guyatt:
The amalgamated pool of funds created and now held in dormant and orphaned
bank accounts runs to trillions of dollars, according to insiders.
At the
low end of estimates, there is believed to be enough to pay off the US
national debt plus some change. At the higher end, estimates range up to
hundreds of trillions of dollars.
I have been repeatedly told, almost
matter-of-factly, that the higher estimates are closer to the truth. I
simply dont know how big the sums amount to, but I can document US$12
trillion. [47]
The CIA and other developed world intelligence agencies would cooperate with
the political and economic elites of different nations under the auspices of
the Bilderberg Group to ensure these enormous sums were directed into the
global Manhattan project.
The trillion dollar lawsuit introduced to the New York District court
involves only a small portion of what are large caches of black gold
hidden in Taiwan, China, Philippines, South America, Switzerland and
elsewhere.
Whenever the rightful owners, their descendents or
representatives, attempt to redeem the bonds issued against their gold, they
get caught up in a complex legal process that often results in charges of
financial fraud. This is what has happened with
the Chiasso Italy incident
which is the core of the New York lawsuit.
David Guyatt described a similar
incident that occurred in the 1990s in his ebook, The Secret Gold Treaty.
Ownership of the majority of black gold, however, is unclear due to the
twists and turns of historys wars where national treasures were looted and
hidden in secret locations by invading forces.
This historical process has
made black gold ideal collateral for long-term funding of a secret
Global Manhattan Project where bonds can be issued against the hidden gold by major
financial institutions. Organizations such as the Bilderberg Group help
coordinate international efforts to fund this global project through black
gold and other available funding revenues created by the CIA and other
intelligence agencies.
The ultimate goal of this globally coordinated
Manhattan Project is to comprehensively deal extraterrestrial life and
technology, the vastness and complexity of which would otherwise dwarf the
resources of any one nation.
Update - 1/18/12
I received the following email by French author
Jean-Marie Le Ray after publishing the above study.
"Now, the fact is that bonds seized by the
Italian authorities in June 2009 (134.5 billion $) are not the same than
bonds claimed by Keenan in his lawsuit (144.5 billion $), with different
serial numbers, as
I explain here".
Consequently, the financial instruments mentioned in Keenan's lawsuit are
different to those seized by the Italian authorities in June 2009. It
appears that Dal Bosco gained possession of another set of Dragon Family
Financial Instruments (DFFI) in September 2009 to those confiscated at
Chiasso.
This supports the claim by Keenan and the Dragon Family that the
bonds seized at Chiasso are only a portion of the total amount of bonds held
by the Dragon Family.
