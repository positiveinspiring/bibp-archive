The Enemy Struck America. But Who Is The Enemy?
Fabled Enemies is unlike any 9/11 documentary ever put together. Rather than
focusing on the physical anomalies at the World Trade Center and Pentagon,
this film follows the intelligence ties of
Osama Bin Laden, the alleged
hijackers, and those who were actually detained on 9/11.
The movie delves deeply into the roles of
separate Nations that were involved in supporting the 9/11 attacks. From
Israel to Saudi Arabia to Pakistan, and even the
United States itself, no
one is spared in this scathing expose that pulls no punches.
Sit back and get ready to learn how members of
the FBI had their investigations into Bin Laden obstructed and shut down,
how the hijackers were trained at US bases, that military drills crippled
our defense and facilitated the attacks, how the
Shadow Government was
actually activated that day, and much much more.
