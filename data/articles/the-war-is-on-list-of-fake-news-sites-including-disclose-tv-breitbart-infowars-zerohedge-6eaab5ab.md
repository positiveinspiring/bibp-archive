Internet giants proposed new regulations to crack down on content this week.
This comes one week after Hillary Clinton suffered a stunning loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Google, Facebook and Twitter announced changes this week.
Both Facebook and Google have announced that they are curbing the searchability of phony news across their platforms. Google said they would stop fake and misleading websites from utilizing the company's ad-selling software, stopping their revenue.
Twitter also announced Tuesday that it would update its "mute" function for users to hide content they do not want to see.
Now we have a rough idea who they are going to target
A far left Massachusetts professor has compiled a list of "fake and misleading" news websites.

I'm including them here, for now, because,
they have the potential to perpetuate misinformation based on different audience (mis)interpretations to make sure anyone who reads a story by The Onion, for example, understands its purpose
