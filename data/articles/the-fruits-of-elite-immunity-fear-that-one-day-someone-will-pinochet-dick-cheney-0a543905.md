Former Vice President Dick Cheney
Less than three years ago, Dick Cheney was
presiding over policies that left hundreds of thousands of innocent people
dead from a war of aggression, constructed a worldwide torture regime, and
spied on thousands of Americans without the warrants required by law, all of
which resulted in his leaving office as one of the
most reviled political
figures in decades.
But thanks to the decision to block all legal
investigations into his chronic criminality, those matters have been
relegated to mere pedestrian partisan disputes, and Cheney is thus now
preparing to be feted - and further enriched - as a Wise and Serious
Statesman with the release of his memoirs this week: one in which he
proudly
boasts (yet again) of the very crimes for which he was immunized.
As he
embarks on his
massive publicity-generating media tour of interviews, Cheney
faces no indictments or criminal juries, but rather reverent, rehabilitative
tributes, illustrated by this, from
Politico today:
The Arena:
Will memoire improve Cheney's Image? Has the
former vice president been proven right about the Iraq invasion and
other global issues?
That's what happens when the Government - marching under the deceitful
Orwellian banner of Look Forward, Not Backward - demands that its citizens
avert their eyes from the crimes of their leaders so that all can be
forgotten:
the crimes become non-crimes, legitimate acts of political
choice, and the
criminals become instantly rehabilitated by the message that
nothing they did warrants punishment.
That's the same reason people like
John Yoo and Alberto Gonzales are defending their torture and illegal spying
actions not in a courtroom but in a
lush conference of elites in Aspen.
The U.S. Government loves to
demand that other countries hold their
political leaders accountable for serious crimes,
dispensing lectures on the
imperatives of the rule of law.
Numerous states
bar ordinary convicts from
profiting from their crimes with books.
David Hicks, an Australian citizen
imprisoned without charges for six years at Cheney's Guantanamo, just had
$10,000
seized by the Australian government in revenue from his book about
his time in that prison camp on the ground that he is barred from profiting
from his uncharged, unproven crimes.
By rather stark contrast, Dick Cheney will prance around the next several
weeks in the nation's largest media venues, engaging in civil, Serious
debates about whether he was right to invade other countries, torture, and
illegally spy on Americans, and will profit greatly by doing so.
There are
many factors accounting for his good fortune, the most important of which
are the protective shield of immunity bestowed upon him by the current
administration and the more generalized American principle that criminal
accountability is only for ordinary citizens and other nations' (unfriendly)
rulers.
Speaking of that principle, Matt Taibbi
today explores the battle between
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the White House over
accountability for Wall Street's mortgage fraud schemes.
UPDATE
I'll be on MSNBC tonight at 8:10 pm EST or so, on Lawrence
O'Donnell's Last Word program, talking about these matters with guest-host
Chris Hayes.
