With the election over, theres no political
rationale for
the Fed printing another $600 billion.
Which can mean only one thing: What theyre
seeing must be terrifying enough to make another round of quantitative
easing seem like the least dangerous alternative.
Theyre wrong, says Prudent Bears Doug Noland in his latest
Credit Bubble Bulletin:
It seems again worth highlighting a couple
key sentences from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichets July 22, 2010
op-ed piece in the Financial Times,
Stimulate no more - it is now time for
all to tighten.
Given the magnitude of annual budget
deficits and the ballooning of outstanding public debt, the standard
linear economic models used to project the impact of fiscal
restraint or fiscal stimuli may no longer be reliable. In
extraordinary times, the economy may be close to non-linear
phenomena such as a rapid deterioration of confidence among broad
constituencies of households, enterprises, savers and investors.
The
Bernanke Fed is playing with fire here.
QE1 was implemented in an environment of
deleveraging, impaired global financial systems and acute economic
contraction. And, importantly, the dollar was enjoying strong performance in
the marketplace as global risk markets suffered from de-risking and general
outflows. QE1 had a stabilizing influence, as it worked to accommodate
financial sector de-leveraging.
The QE2 backdrop is altogether different.
Global markets are these days demonstrating
robust inflationary biases. Risk-embracement is back in vogue - speculation
is rife. The emerging economies and global risk markets have been on the
receiving end of massive financial (hot money) flows. Meanwhile, the
dollar has been under heavy selling pressure with heightened risk of a
crisis of confidence.
This weeks market activity supported my view
that the environment would seem to dictate that QE2 will only exacerbate
increasingly unwieldy financial flows and unstable global markets.
What does non-linear
mean when applied to financial markets?
It means were approaching a point when the
future doesnt emerge logically and consistently from the immediate
past. Instead of asset prices and interest rates moving by typical modest
increments, theyll gap one way or the other. Circuit breakers might close
the stock market while some commodities open lock limit up without even
trading.
Big banks or industrial companies will fail
without warning because their derivatives have blown up, while companies in
hot industries go public and double on their first day of trading. Some
currencies will plunge while others soar, leading disadvantaged countries to
impose capital controls and tariffs. And so on - with the US at the center
of the storm.
In a non-linear world, rational planning becomes impossible because no one
knows where lightning will strike next.
And the inflation/deflation debate loses its
meaning, says Noland:
In post-announcement analysis of the Feds
commitment to another $600bn of Treasury purchases, Bill Gross commented
on CNBC that,
the biggest risk is inflation down the
road.
I again disagree with Mr. Gross.
The greatest risk is a destabilizing crisis
of confidence for our nations debt obligations. Our system doubled
total mortgage debt in just over six years during the mortgage/Wall
Street finance Bubble. Washington is now on track to double the federal
debt load in just over 4 years.
Federal Reserve policy remains instrumental
in accommodating a precarious Credit Bubble at the heart of our monetary
system.
