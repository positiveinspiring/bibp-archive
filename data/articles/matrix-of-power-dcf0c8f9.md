# Matrix of Power

Part a
The seal that we have on the American dollar bill is an occult seal of an
occult society, pursuing an occult agenda. Most are not aware of that now,
however, we are hopeful that many of the people of our country will become
aware of it soon. We are optimistic that books like Fire in the Minds of Men
will help make the general population aware of the occult forces that are
mooing their government and their lives.
It is not our purpose to spend too much time on this particular order of
Freemasonry, or the Illuminati. But we do want to spend enough time so that
you understand how it worked, what its purposes were and how it affects the
world societies, because it is still with us today. It has taken on
different forms, in different countries, but is still basically the secret
ruling power in the world today.
Now, perhaps, some of you are aware of this material that we are discussing
right now, and maybe you are not. But, to show that this is not just our
understanding of things, we have gone as far back as the founding of the
United States. We have some comments from George Washington, which we are
going to share with you here. The following is an article from the Grand
Jury of the State of Pennsylvania, published in the 1800's, dealing with
Freemasonry and the Illuminati, and the problems they were confronting in
the State of Pennsylvania.
As we said, George Washington mentioned the Illuminati, and I mentioned the
Illuminati before in this book, in relation to the democratic societies that
were being founded in the United States. The Democratic Party today is an
outgrowth of what we call the democratic societies of Europe. The democratic
societies, on the surface, sound good. But when one looks further into what
democracy means and how it actually works, it does not seem to function too
well. And, there's a reason.
Let me first give you an example.
In the Eleventh Report, State
Investigations Committee on Education, published in 1953 by the California
State Senate, it talks about the Illuminati. If you go out and search for
it, a copy can be obtained for your further investigation. In dealing with
the subject of Communism and secret societies of Communism in 1953, on page
168, we will demonstrate further how important it is that you should know
about, as well as study this document. It says,
Since many intelligent persons, even those in high official positions do not
appear to have acquainted themselves with the real nature and seriousness of
Communism, it is perhaps appropriate to briefly provide you with some really
informative, authentic data concerning it. Communism and Russia are by no
means synonymous. Russia merely occupies the unfortunate position of being
Communism's first victim.
Communism is synonymous with world revolution and
seeks the destruction of all nations, the abolition of patriotism, religion,
marriage, family, private property and all political and civil liberties,
concerned with the establishment of a worldwide dictatorship of the
so-called proletariat, which is, in fact, an autocratic self-constituted
dictatorship by a small group of self-perpetuating revolutionaries....
A bit later on page 169, the document goes on to say, So-called modern
Communism is apparently the same hypocritical and deadly world conspiracy to
destroy civilization that was founded by the secret order of Illuminati in
Bavaria in May 1, 1776, and that raised its hoary head here in our colonies
at critical periods before the adoption of our Federal Constitution.
The
world revolution conspiracy appears to have been so well organized, and ever
continuing to be ever on the alert to take advantage of every opportunity
presenting itself, or that the conspirators could create. It is significant
in this connection that as early as 1783, when unsettled conditions and
dissatisfaction in some quarters had arisen in the American colonies,
subversive anonymous sermons were circulated among the colonial army to
incite dissatisfaction and rebellion.
George Washington immediately called
the army together and in addressing them used this significant language,
remembering that this is 1783.
George Washington, when addressing the army,
states,
"My God, what can this writer have in view
by recommending such measures? Can he be a friend to the army? Can he be
a friend of this country? Rather, is he not an insidious foe; some
emissary, perhaps, from New York...."
Then in the next paragraph, the California State
Senate report continues,
...it is plain that George Washington
believed that the then center of this secret conspiracy, so far as this
country was concerned, was to be located in the city of New York....
We now know that there has been some sort of a
manipulation of our government, our money, our institutions, and our lives,
by our government. But what we don't realize is that there is a covert
agenda. There is a method to the "madness."
We want to concertedly look into these secret movements of the world and
understand how they affect us and our private lives. Now, we may not think
they affect us on our private level, but they do.
They affect your children
in school, they affect what your children learn, they affect what you learn
from daily and nightly television. There have been many movies discussing
this publicly. Even George Washington in his personal letters mentions the
Illuminati and Freemasonry. George Washington himself was a Freemason.
In response to a letter sent to George Washington in 1798, warning him about
a Masonic movement operating in America, and this particular Masonic
movement referred to as the Illuminati, George Washington responded in a
letter to the person saying:
It was not my intention to doubt that the
doctrines of the Illuminati, the principles of Jacobinism, had not
spread into the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly
satisfied of that fact than I am. The idea that I meant to convey was
that I did not believe that the lodges of Freemasonry in this country,
as societies, have endeavored to promulgate the diabolical tenets of the
pernicious principles of the latter, if they are susceptible to
separation, but, that individuals of them may have done it, or that the
founder, or instrument founded, or the instrument employed to found the
democratic societies in the United States may have had these objects in
mind, and actually had the separation of the people from their
government in view, is too evident to question.
What George Washington was saying was the mere
fact that someone had charged that the Illuminati was operating in America.
George Washington said,
"On the contrary, no one is more satisfied
with that fact, than I am."
And then he proceeded to say that he did not
believe that all Freemasons were involved in this plot, but that the
founders of the democratic society in America, the Democratic Party, as we
call it today in America, had the object in mind of the Illuminati's
projects.
"And the Democratic Party," George
Washington said, "had the separation of the people from their government
in view. It is too evident to be questioned."
That may explain why today, in a democratic
country like America, when the people make certain demands on the
government, they experience no response. The people want this, the
government doesn't respond. The people demand that, the government doesn't
respond, because the whole concept of the democratic process in America was
purposely contrived to divide the people from their government, so that the
people could be out there working hard every day, taking care of their
lives, feeding their children, and sending their politicians to Washington
to look out for them.
When the politicians got there, they were already
members of certain fraternal organizations and all government was already
taken care of, so that the people had nothing to say about anything. And,
that's the point we're trying to make, that when you send politicians to
Washington, DC, they might just as well stay home, because the rhyme and
reason of government has already been decided by secret societies and
fraternal orders that you don't know anything about.
In our discussion of the Illuminati we want to also, when talking about the
dollar bill, and the symbol on the back of the dollar bill, share with you a
pertinent accounting from the Congressional Report, published by the
Congress of the United States.
This report talks about integral steps toward
a British Union, a world state, leading to international strife.
International strife is very much connected with a world state, and British
Union. As we revealed before, Britain is referred to as God's Kingdom, the
United Kingdom. International strife, which is happening throughout the
world, is part and parcel of preparing the world for God's United Kingdom,
and America is playing its critical part.
God's Kingdom is, of course, coming through Britain and America. England has
been chosen to sit on Jehovah's "ruling throne" until Jesus returns
(according to their rules of royalty), which provides the world with a
convenient racist philosophy. As I often mention, that provides the basis
for racism in the world today. And then, we wonder in this country why the
rest of the world doesn't seem to care for America very much.
There is a lot that we should know about concerning the symbols on the
dollar bill. Let me go through another Congressional Report, published back
in 1940.
It says on page 13:
Let me call to your attention the fact that on the reverse of the great seal
of the United States, which appears on our dollar bills, you will find the
exact symbol of the British/Israel World Federation. This symbol is also
carried on the literature of other organizations promoting a world
government, and a world religion. At the bottom of the circle surrounding
the pyramid you will find the wording Novus Ordo Seclorum. It was this new
order that was advocated by Clinton Roosevelt several hundred years ago, and
recently from Philip Drew, and now followed by the Executive.
We understand now that the whole concept of a new world order is a
revolutionary idea developed out of Freemasonry. I want to go back to the
Introduction in the book, Fire in the Minds of Men, and lay the foundation
for something I think you are going to find very interesting. Again, on page
6, we quote, from the Introduction:
A recurrent mythic model for revolutionaries early romantics, the young
Marx, the Russians of Lenin's time was Prometheus, who stole fire from the
gods for the use of mankind. The Promethean faith of revolutionaries
resembled in many respects the general modern belief that science would lead
men out of darkness and into light.
It is interesting that in New York City, the Empire State, in Rockefeller
Plaza, at the very entrance to Rockefeller Plaza is an enormous statue of
Prometheus. How appropriate, and when one understands how the Soviet
Communist Party was financed, organized, and directed out of New York, then
it will not be any great mystery as to why in front of Rockefeller Plaza we
have the figure of this Titan God, Prometheus.
James Billington explains in
his book, Fire in the Minds of Men, that that is a symbol of the world
revolutionaries. Then it goes on to say in the Introduction, that there was
a Millennium coming. A New World Order, a Millennium. A thousand year reign.
From Fire in the Minds of Men it says:
But there was also the more pointed, millennial assumption that, on the new
day that was dawning, the sun would never set. Early during the French
upheaval was born a "solar myth of the revolution," suggesting that the sun
was rising on a new era in which darkness would vanish forever.
This whole idea of the Sun rising on a new era, a new dawn, is the
Millennial assumption.
We can see this openly being used today by our former
President,
George Bush, in such newspaper clippings identified as
The New
World Order, and that the world is now being formed into a New World Order.
We want to talk about that, and what it means for you. The newspapers play a
big part in telling us only what those in power want us to hear.
You thought
this was only a communist idea or concept?
Think again.
We are grateful to The Washington Post, The
New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose
directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of
discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us
to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright
lights of publicity during those years.
But, the work is now much more
sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The
supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is
surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past
centuries.
David Rockefeller,
founder of the
Trilateral Commission, in
an address to a meeting of The Trilateral Commission, in June, 1991.
Control of America's newspapers goes back to the
beginnings of the industrial age, when vested interests with large sums of
cash moved in.
In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests,
the steel, shipbuilding, and powder interest, and their subsidiary
organizations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and
employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United
States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of
the daily press....
They found it was only necessary to purchase the
control of 25 of the greatest papers. An agreement was reached; the
policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor
was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information
regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies,
and other things of national and international nature considered vital
to the interests of the purchasers.
U.S. Congressman Oscar Callawayx,
1917
The point is, what we are being told is
controlled.
Controlled information.
And the New world Order idea is now
starting to be presented to us. As a matter of fact, reported previously in
the daily newspaper, during early 1992, Bush urged us to enter the Gulf War
crisis.
Beneath it, it says he sees the Gulf as a test of the New World
Order. That same "New World Order" is on the back of the dollar bill, it's
plainly written on the bottom of the pyramid that's on the dollar bill.
That's an interesting concept, and it's one that you should know about,
because what went on in the Middle East Gulf War was part and parcel of a
Freemasonic movement.
Freemasonry has made arrangements to organize and direct financial control
for different segments of society in our country and throughout the world.
They have realized that in this country black movements are moving within
mainstream America, therefore, the need arises for black leaders to be able
to fall in line, to go along, to get along.
Some of the black Freemasons that have finally
been accepted into the order, for instance, are:
-
Jesse Jackson
-
Andrew Young, Mayor of Atlanta
-
Kenneth Gibson, three-time Mayor of the City of Newark, New Jersey
-
the late
Harold Washington, the Mayor of Chicago
-
State Senator, Julian Bond
-
Supreme
Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall
-
Marion Barry, Mayor of District of
Columbia.
The five "circles" of Freemasonic friendship:
In addition to five certain
countries (Italy, France, Germany, England and America),
this symbol is more
recently said to represent the continents of the earth.
We see that Freemasonry uses all races to accomplish its
objectives.
In Freemasonry in Europe the groups were called circles. The circles were
called friends. There were five circle of friends, America being one of
them. Italy, France, Germany, England, and America are the five circles of
friends. They were called in European Freemasonry, the Olympiads, so that
today the Olympiad Organization's symbol is five circles, the five Masonic
circles of friends.
Of course, the Audi automobile has only four circles,
because America's not included in that project.
Only four circles?
Of course, America is not included in this project.
The circles were, to be
sure, the circle of friends within the Masonic league. The torch, of course,
the Olympic torch, is the torch of Prometheus, the God who stole fire for
the service of man. And, again, as we said, in New York in front of
Rockefeller Plaza you will see the statue of Prometheus, holding in his hand
aflame, the torch, the fire of revolution.
The dime, of course, on the
Mercury head dime, unscripted on the back of the dime you will find the torch
of illumination. It's still there today. The modern
American dime has the
torch of illumination. The Statue of Liberty has the torch. Of course, on
all universities and colleges we find in their symbols and emblems that they
have the torches, symbolically standing for illumination of the Illuminati.
As a matter of fact, when you are a graduate from a university you become an
Alumni, which is taken from, obviously, Aluminati, Illuminati. Emphasizing
that you become illuminated when you go to a university.
The torch is also used in the Amoco Oil logo. It is found many, many places.
Chevrolet, in 18 its Saffron Division of General Motors, is putting out its illuminum car, not aluminum, but an "illumined" car from the Illuminati.
Then when you go to college and a university, or even when you graduate from
high school you come out processionally with a black robe, which is black
for Saffron, the God of the Hebrews, requiring that you wear the square
mortarboard on top of your head.
The square mortarboards are, of course,
used by the Freemasons for their plaster, so that is why you wear a square
mortarboard when you graduate, ultimately becoming an Alumni.
It all has to
do with Freemasonry, it all has to do with the control of education in this
country, the control of our religious thinking, our government, our money,
our lives, everything.
Your corner drugstore is influenced by Freemasonry,
secret societies, occult orders, and politics of the scientific kind.
Our founding fathers are probably turning over in their graves as they see
what has happened to us, and how we have been deflected from our purpose and
our mission in the world, to ultimately become nothing but pawns in the
game.
Our liberty is threatened. Look at the liberty bell, the symbol of
liberty. An equal identical bell was found, with the same crack, in Moscow.
It's a very famous liberty bell, with the same crack.
It has becomes known
as a symbol, the symbol of the
Brotherhood of the Bell, Bell, being
Bel, the
ancient God in the Mesopotamian Valley, being the one that we call
Beelzebub, or
Yahweh.
There are way too many symbols, just too many things going on in our world
that we are not aware of in this busy time in which we live. That
incidentally, as I
mentioned before, provides the basis for racism in the
world today. Let us propose that it is high time we take time to look around
us and see the emblems of power, see the emblems and seals of our
government.
Look at the dollar bill, instead of trying to earn one. Just
look at one for a change, look on the front at the Masonic emblems on it,
look on the back for the Masonic emblems there. Ask yourself why it is that
our country operates the way it does and is there a rhyme or reason as to
the way things happen.
One should understand that General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and all the
other companies in the industrialized world have a specific agenda. They
don't just wake up every morning and decide what they are going to do.
Large, very large international corporations have to make plans for
tomorrow, for next week, for next year.
When you have hundreds of thousands
of people on a payroll, you can't afford to wait to the last minute to
decide what you are going to do. The ship of state is far too large to turn
around, just overnight.
It's like a giant ocean liner.
The ship of state is
a very large vessel. You have to make plans for it, you have to direct the
people. You have to concentrate your power, you have to concentrate the
people's attention on certain things, in order to get them to go in the
direction for which you want them to participate. We are a very large and
powerful people in America, so our masters have to direct our thinking for
us and prepare us in advance for their designated plans, for their hidden
agendas.
And, of course, like docile sheep we just go along to get along, because we
don't know anymore about it than what we see on television. It's about time
that we look into this enigmatic world that we live in and examine who we
are, why we are doing what we are doing, and notice just where we are going.
That's the purpose of what we are trying to do.
As we said before, we are
not trying to explain everything in detail, because we simply couldn't in
this short publication. But, we are trying to make you aware that there is
an enormous world of material out there that you should be concerned with
and know about, and it is our purpose to provide you with that material.
You
will find that the many things which we have invest world, are just
fascinating.
When we remember that Abraham Lincoln was the first President to
break all
diplomatic ties with
the Vatican, in the 1860's, we become even more aware.
Diplomatic ties continued broken with the United States until the coming of
President Ronald Reagan.
he reestablished full diplomatic ties with the
Vatican, the first President, since Lincoln, to do so. Reagan's next
official act was to travel to Europe, at least three times, to meet in
private with the Pope. We were not told what was discussed.
Later, the Pope
was a host to other summit meetings. And then, of course, Ronald Reagan
traveled to Europe to visit the war dead, or so we are told. he ended up at Bitsburg Cemetery, the burial spot for the Nazi SS Officers. We have to
wonder what was going on.
Did Ronald Reagan not know he was going to a Nazi
burial spot? Of course he did, he's not a fool.
There are no such things as
mistakes made by presidents. What they do and where they go is always well
planned and done for a reason.
When we see things happening on the world scene, and we say the President
made a mistake, the government made a mistake, you have to know that a
government the size of the United States doesn't make mistakes. They are
well calculated moves. They know what they are doing, and often times have a
hidden agenda that they simply cannot make public.
You would be amazed as to
how often this happens.
They have an idea, a purpose, so they don't make
mistakes. Ronald Reagan's going to Bitsburg was purposely contrived. It
signaled something to secret societies. The Gulf crisis, in the early 1990s,
was just another calculated planning the scheme of world agendas. There are
many innuendoes, and things that are being said, which lead one to
understand that there is more going on in the Middle East than what we were
told about, and as we said before, it has little to nothing to do with oil,
little to nothing to do with a threat against this country, because the
bottom line is that this country has very little it can be threatened with.
Threats certainly do exist, but not to the degree that one would think.
There are some interesting books out there which show many Freemasonic
connections to our societies, religions, and political leaders, including
connections 20 between the
Order of Malta with the Pope and Rome, and the
Freemasonic double headed eagle with England.
England and Rome use
Freemasonic symbols at the highest religious levels, elements in relation to
Christianity or should I say Jehovah Witness's brand of Christianity.
We
have such books as
Christian by Degrees, Masonic Revealed in the Light and
the Faith of Jehovah, Testament for a New World, The Seven Books Containing
a Sense of Spiritual Wisdom, given to us by the Knights Templar.
Therein,
the Table of Contents reveals a Book of Jehovah and the book of Jehovah's
Kingdom on Earth, with the Knights emblem. We see that Jehovah's Kingdom on
Earth is no more than a Masonic Kingdom, like the British United Kingdom.
Jehovah Witnesses, along with the
Mormons,
Seventh Day Adventists and, as we
said, all the other York Rite Masonic cults in America, are consistently
spreading.
They are the shock troops, so to speak, for Freemasonry, who
spread the message for the kingdom to the rest of us in this nation to
accept their Masonic Kingdom. They, unbeknownst to themselves, are the
forerunners for a New World Order. However, unfortunately, they have no idea
in this world, just what is coming. They have been duped, and the yare too
proud and arrogant to understand that duplicity.
We studied a book called the Teachings of Freemasonry, and on the book's
cover we found the Jewish Star of David, because, in fact, Freemasonry is
heavily Jewish. Freemasonry has always known that its greatest enemy in
Western Civilization is Rome. That's why there has always been this
animosity between the Catholic Church and Judaism.
There has always been
this animosity between the Catholic Church and Judaism. For centuries, the
Jews have been persecuted in the Old Country, in Europe, and there still
remains that animosity between Judaism and the Catholic movement today, but
not because of religion, but because of the secret societies that operate
behind the scenes of both of those organizations.
You might be interested to know that the Pope's headdress, the Papal
headdress, actually goes back to an ancient Jewish headdress. And, of
course, the Pope wears the yurmulke, and the highly ordained Catholic
Cardinals wear the yurmulke. But, notice in particular, that the Pope and
clergy wear a headdress
that is Freemasonic.
The breastplate and/or apron
are also frequently associated with freemasonry.
We have other Masonic garb
showing that when we see the Pope and we see the priest, we now know that
when we see other religious movements throughout the world, their garb it's
all representative of Freemasonry.
I think some of those now among us that are concerned with the race issue
throughout the world might be interested to know that there is another
Freemasonic brotherhood of power, which is presented as an expose of the
secret Afrikaner Brotherhood. So when we see what is happening in South
Africa, it is no great wonder that South Africa's greatest friend is Israel.
There is a famous song from the 1960's, entitled, Does Anyone Know What Time
It Is? We respectfully submit that it is time to wake up and face the most
serious problems that we face as a free society. It is high time, like the
owl, that we see things that have been kept in the dark from us.
This will
not be difficult, because the truth has been hiding in plain view all along.
In the Congress resides the American symbols of power, known in the
dictionary as the fasces. The fasces itself is nothing more than an ancient
symbol, of an ancient priesthood, from an ancient world. The ax explains
why, in the Second World War, the powers of Hitler were called the Axis
Powers.
The fasces was used by the Priesthood of the Ax in the ancient world
and by Adolph Hitler, General Franco, and Mussolini, and many other
underworld fascist movements, likened to Mafia-style organizations, commonly
understood to be called the "Untouchables."
As I said previously, and as even Time Magazine has obviously had to admit,
our leaders are the best that money can buy. They have sold you out to a
hidden agenda covertly kept behind the scenes from a long time ago. Now, you
have just seen the faint outline.
In the past, we have tried to enlighten
your mind to a subject that has not been adequately dealt with, and that is
the secret societies and subversive movements that are restructuring our
world, by using all sorts of guises and excuses for their subterfusive
profiles. Everything from the Jehovah Witnesses, to the Mormons, with their
Zion National Park, and the New World Order, the racist philosophies that
pervade the Western World.
It has imminently become an idea whose time has
come to speak of these subjects.
We have adequate documentation for the revelations exposed in this book, if
you would like to inquire further for corroboration of this mountain of
evidence. It is obvious that such a vastly controlled volume of research
cannot be adequately covered in this modest edition. We do sincerely hope
that we can present some of these broader concepts and ideas that could be
fresh and new for you to explore.
We at least want to impress on you this
thought.
This country was based on the premise that individual citizens have
a right to know the truth, as well as the right to understand and to expect
from our leaders to exemplify the truth.
We haven't received the truth from
our leaders, and it now appears conclusive that we are not going to be
guaranteed that unalienable right as American citizens. They have their own
agenda, and their own ideas about what they are going to do to continue this
world control and domination, and it apparently
doesn't include the opinions
of you, me, or our next door neighbors.
All that you are expected to do is
work hard and pay your taxes, be a capital product for their controlled
system, and not ever ask any questions! I think it is now high time that our
country does ask questions of its leaders its "misleaders." As I have stated
before, we have the best religious and political leaders that money can buy.
It is definitely time we begin to look at these subjects very deeply.
Churches, almost all churches that you will go to have a pointed arch, the
stained windows, or the pointed doors. Now, the pointed arch is because of
the female, that's the female womb. That is why for a couple of thousand
years now, Christian priests have always been officiating.
They have always
been in charge, after walking through those doors, and they don't want women
priests because it doesn't look right for a women to be "in" a women.
It has
to do with sex, and that's why the pointed door on the church has to do with
the pointed arch of the female. And, the man is said to be dominating, or
ruling over, commanding the pointed arch. he enters into the pointed arch,
and at that time is referred to in the ancient Hebrew as the holy of holies.
The holy of holies was always considered to be the womb, the holy arch, and
that's where life comes from, and that's as close to God as you are going to
get.
Therefore, the sex act was considered to be the closest way that man
and woman could get to God. It doesn't have a thing to do with being holy,
it has to do with life and the female womb.
The priest wears the long black robe, because he is wearing the garb of the
woman, the long black robe of the female.
It was always considered, from ancient times, that all Divine wisdom was in
the women, the female. She was called Sophia, which meant wisdom to the
Greeks. Another female word is nun. In Hebrew the word nun is for
fish, and
there were people in the Bible like Joshua, the son of nun, and also Jesus,
son of the fish.
So there were men connected with this nun/fish meaning in
the Bible.
In many cases,
Yahweh, or Jehovah, was an hermaphrodite the God
of the Hebrews
was both male and female. That's what the Hebrew word for the Tetragrammaton implied, that's why the Bible says that God made man in
his
own image, "made he male and female," because God was male and female.
The seven candle lamp stand was the seven lights of the ancient world.
A
candle is a light.
Churches traditionally have
an arched entryway,
representing the female,
which the priest enters into.
It is not a big light, but a little light, that
is why you had seven lights in the heavens. The seven polestars, the seven
great Gods of the ancient world, in the heavens. Today we hear that God is
love, but God is not "Jove." Somewhere along the line the "J" got changed to
"L," now God is Love. Originally, God was Jove.
Our system of numbering in
America goes to ten and stops, because ten is the holy number. The holy
number in ancient Egyptian, the number of God, was IO. The letter I, and the
letter O. Today we have 10 the number ten, which is the highest unit you can
go to, so it has nothing to do with God, it has to do with Egypt.
Our culture and our country today has its connections with England.
England's royal family comes from the original Egyptian divinities, which
were Isis, Osiris, and Horus. Those three divinities were called the holy
family, or the royal family, and of course, today, we have the royal family
in England. Believe it or not, that's where their royalty comes from black
Africa but we don't talk about that publicly because we don't want to bring
this subject up.
That royal family in England gets their lineage, and there
so-called royalty from actual divinities in Egypt. When you strip it all
down, you are going to find out that there is nothing royal about England. I
love England, and I love the English people, I am just telling you what my
investigation has revealed through years of study, from books, and other
academic sources.
The words British, in Hebrew, mean a contract, or writ, a
holy writ. So the word for Brit is contract, or covenant. And the word
in Hebrew for man is ish; therefore Brit ish is
the covenant man, or holy
man. That is where we get the idea that the King of England is so holy,
because he is Brit ish, or a "holy man." But that is Hebrew.
Then when you
find out where this whole idea of the holiness came from, and believe me,
this is considered a very serious thing, because the King of England is
considered to be one of the holiest men in the world. When you understand,
then there is something that you will want to watch.
And that is when Prince
Charles or Andrew or whoever is crowned King, the Archbishop of Canterbury
will read his initiation rites to the King, to the young man, and he will
recite his rites back.
When he is given those initiation rites to be King,
listen to the words that the Archbishop of Canterbury says to that new King.
he is saying something, and I am paraphrasing, something to the effect that,
"you are accepting this position as the King of England for Jehovah. You are
sitting on the throne of David. And this is Jehovah's throne, God's kingdom,
therefore, you are the Messiah over the United Kingdom God's united
kingdom."
Now, to truly understand God's "united kingdom," (and we're
talking about the Kingdom of God), we must go back to Egypt. Now, we have
some serious problems here.
The United States government is being ruled from the "White House," the
government of England is being ruled from what is called "Whitehall," and
Whitehall, like our White House, is the symbol of power because the hall is
like the Masonic hall, the lodge hall, the union hall.
For Jehovah's
Witnesses it is the Kingdom Hall, and it is the Kingdom because Jehovah's
Witnesses, like their Mormon brothers, the Seventh Day Adventist,
Christadelphians, World Wide Church of God, all of those groups are
British
Israelite Masonic cults.
Organized, directed and financed by 26 Freemasons
of the York Rite class. Freemasonry gave birth to the Mormon Church, Seventh
Day Adventist, Christadelphians, Jehovah's Witnesses, and a host of other
cults and groups which can be considered to be British Israel Masonic cults,
who are going about telling everyone that there is going to be a new kingdom
and a New World Order, and that white folks are going to rule the world.
That's why the blacks are not looked upon very highly in the Mormon Church,
or anywhere else in America, because this is a white man's country. It has
to do with where we come from in England, and with God's kingdom and the
United Kingdom, and the kingdom that is coming is going to be ruled by white
men.
This is the ideology coming through the New World Order, coming through the
secret societies, taking from the ancient religions and implementing their
diabolical agendas, through the secret societies, through the various
religious sects. The shock troupes, and the people who are introduced to the
Masonic Order, the religious groups are given the out of cover of Jesus, and
the wonderful story.
What you don't know is that this is just a story that
is actually being used to dupe and distract you from the truth. The whole
New World Order agenda is being used as a front for a very sinister movement
in the world, for world domination. It doesn't have a thing to do with
anything holy, it has to do with politics.
There are some very powerful families fighting to see who is going to own
you, that's about what it amounts to, who is going to own you and your
families. There is violent philosophy in Rome, as they want to continue
their world domination from the old world, in opposition to the New World
Order.
We have New York, the Empire State (like the Roman Empire), and
the
United Nations is based in New York.
Freemasonry, once it is totally
disassembled, and you look at all the parts, is nothing more than eclectic
Judaism. It is a form of Judaism, it is not Judaism at all, but a form of
Judaism that using Judaic symbols and emblems. So, it is not actually
Jewish, but is based on the old cabalistic Jewish system.
Again, I want to overemphasize here, that I am not talking about the
regular, normal Freemasonry here please keep this upper most in your mind
all the Masons I know are fine people. I am not talking about the Masons
that you live next door to. I am talking about a very secret occult society
that rules this world from behind the scenes. And, as I have said many times
before, don't look at the Mafia for being evil.
You had better look at the
real criminals, the real criminals are the ones you are never going to see.
You are never going to see them, hear them, or have anything to do with them
directly. They are so deeply embedded in the ancient world, and in the
modern day world you will never know who they are. You can
get a taste of
that from the movie JFK, but that doesn't even begin to tell the story.
Many
conflicts going on today in the Middle East have to do with the Masonic
Order, as King Hussein of Jordan is heavily into the Masonic Order.
One of
the groups is called the Cedars of Lebanon. It is a Masonic group. We have a
hospital in Los Angeles called the Cedars of Lebanon. In the Middle East
there is a secret society called the Cedars of Lebanon. It has nothing to do
with those pretty trees, it has to do with a secret group of men called the
Cedars of Lebanon (?).
Somebody is using us. The business of banking was set up in the year 1099.
An income tax form is a 1099. Who decided on that? Think about it.
What can we do about this?
William Randolph Hearst, the American newspaper publisher, said,
"Any man
who has the brains to think, and the nerve to act for the benefit of the
country, is always considered a radical by those who are content with
stagnation and willing to endure their own disaster."
I am not willing to
endure my own disaster. The things that are going down, like AIDS being a
blood born disease, the blessing in your blood, is the ideology from ancient
times.
In 1953, in the Fall, Norman Dodd was Director for the
Reese
Committee.
The
Reese Committee was set up to investigate the foundations,
those fine admirable foundations, like the Rockefeller Foundation and the
Warburg Foundation, and all those back East foundations, with their hundreds
of millions of dollars that we don't know anything about.
According to the
record, a man name Rowan Gaither, who was the President of the Ford
Foundation, met with Norman Dodd and told him this.
"Mr. Dodd, all of us at
the policy making level have had experience in the OSS or with the European
Economic Administration, with directives from the White House. We operate
here today under those directives from the White House."
When he was asked by Mr. Dodd, "What
directives have you been operating under?"
President Gaither replied, "The substance of
those directives as foundations, were that we shall use our grant making
powers to so alter our United States so that we can be comfortably
merged with the Soviet Union in the near future."
Is there something going on here
that we don't know about, in this
New World Order?
I would like to advise the reader to understand what we are not doing. We
are not trying to put down anyone's faith, or religion, what we are trying
to do is get to the bottom of what we are dealing with in the world today.
If whatever we believe is not true, then we had better find out and get to
the bottom line, because we are all on this planet together, and if we are
part of something that isn't true, it would behoove us to find out about it
now.
That is what I am hoping to be able to accomplish.
In 1959 I began a study of religio-political philosophy, which turned into a
lifetime of investigative research into this subject. When I was just a
little kid a member of my family was a part of the team at the Vatican in
the Vatican's Secretary of State Office. And, on occasion, when he would
come to the United States to visit our family he would sit and talk for
hours about all of the intrigue going on concerning world affairs of state.
So, as a little kid I was hearing this kind of material about the
fascinating subjects related to secret societies and fraternal orders.
I know a lot of people don't know very much about the Vatican, The Vatican
is a country unto itself. A very powerful country, politically speaking.
Heads of State from all over the world come to the Vatican to pay homage to
the Papacy. The Papacy plays a very, very important role in international
politics and it has always been able to demonstrate this immense power in
world affairs.
However, what is most interesting, is that a new development
has been emerging that concerns an occult Freemasonic order, operating under
the name of P-2,
or Propaganda Due.
It is made up of some of the most profoundly significant,
right wing, fascist, Freemasonic figures in all of Europe. This is actually
true, because the man who was the Grand Master of this Masonic order (P-2), Licio Gelli, was invited by Ronald Reagan's Presidential campaign to appear
at his inauguration.
There are pictures of Ronald Reagan with
Licio Gelli.
Gelli supported the fascist Mussolini in World War II, then was forced to
flee to Argentina, where he supported dictator Juan Peron. Gelli finally
returned to Italy in the 1960s and that is when he joined the Grande Oriente,
as it was known in Italy, meaning the Masonic Order of Freemasonry. With the
support of the Grande Oriente, Gelli was cleared for the his war crimes that
he'd been charged with.
Gelli, as Grand Master of P-2, made it the most
violent and powerful secret political organization in Italy. A former U.S.
intelligence officer who became involved with the group called P-2 "a state
within a state." Much like the Vatican. There are clearly "political ties"
between these organizations and world governments as evidenced by Gelli and
Reagan. We don't normally see them on the surface.
Europe is a very small
world and so is America. There are many important connections between Europe
and America, but they are often hidden, below the surface. I know. I grew up
listening to it among private family members.
Let me explain something that you might find quite interesting. We're
hearing a lot about this New World Order that former President
George Bush
originally kept talking about. Europe was the "Old World" and America, of
course, after it was discovered, was known as the "New World."
In the "Old
World," Europe was dominated by
the Vatican. The Vatican dominated Europe
and Europe dominated the world.
It was said that the power behind the
Vatican was an order of Freemasonry and believe me, the more one looks into
it, the more truth to this fact emerges. It was an occult order of
Freemasonry operating from behind the scenes, and thereby exercising
influence over European politics. Now, that was an old order, like the
Masonic Order, or an order of priesthood. It was commonly known as a
fraternal order.
This group, this very small group of people actually "ran
the show."
Yes, from behind the scenes, with the Vatican out in front as the
front organization. The Vatican representing religion would be untouchable.
And, of course you wouldn't want to do anything to harm or interfere with
God's will.
The power behind the Vatican throne for the past fifteen or sixteen hundred
years has been referred to in circles as the "Old World Order." It was the
"Order" of the "Old World." Then, when the United States was discovered
we've become know as the "New World." And, therefore there are now
religio-political
fraternal orders which dominate our country. And through us, dominate the
world.
And, that is a "New World Order." So, when
we hear the word "order," they are talking about
a fraternal order, like an order of priesthood, or a Masonic Order.
This "New World Order" is operating out of our country.
What you have to remember too, when you say religio-political movement,
there has never been a religious movement, throughout the world, that didn't
have a little politics involved in it. There has never been a political
movement that wasn't a little bit religious. As a matter of fact, at one
time in the ancient world, government was religion. And religion was
government.
Today, in our modern world we are not really aware of that. We
naively think that things have always been the way they are in the United
States. But, this is not so. There is a profound connection between religion
and politics, even in our country. We ostensibly say that we on the outside
of these powerful organizations, believe that there is a separation of
church and state. The American armed forces hire Chaplains. They become
officers in the military. Therefore, they are paid religious leaders to
represent God for the government.
You have to remember that when you get
married, you don't go before God for your marriage. You go before the State
and you get a license, before you can talk to God about marriage. And, if
your marriage doesn't work out, you don't go to God and talk to him about
it, you go to the courts, because that's where the real power is contained.
To draw the point out again, that there is a connection between church and
state, just think about the church arena. Inside of the church is just like
inside a courtroom.
Symbols are like letters of an alphabet. You put them together and they
spell a word, and you put enough of them together and you've got the story.
Today, we have the symbol of ARCO, which is the Masonic square, which goes
back to Jason and the ARCO-naughts (argonauts). These symbols are images
that we may not know the full story about.
But, look at these emblems in the
oil companies, on cigarette packages, and on food items, and automobile
emblems; they are all classic examples.
It has been said that the emblems and symbols dwell deep within the
collective unconscious. So, this is not just a coincidence that they happen
to be religious, and they also happen to be political. They are also used in
advertising campaigns. Everybody is using the same symbols. There are only a
finite number of symbols that make any sense, so everybody is going to use
them.
Governmental politics is actually a business, a business that has been
around a very long time. America is big business, originally founded as a
business corporation. The original thirteen colonies were not called
colonies. They were called companies. That's why in corporate law every
corporation must have a president and a vice president. And, we have a
president and a vice president of our corporation our country. This county,
the United States of America is a business.
Or, at least it was, as even the
U.S. business can show a loss, or whatever. So, there is much chicanery
going on both in politics and religion. When you have a financial loss, just
remember that there is just so much money out there out in the world. And,
if somebody is losing it, that means it is going somewhere.
Therefore,
someone is making it.
When you see a big stock market crash and everyone
loses their money, then somebody else just made a lot of money. Really all
that amounts to is that this huge amount of money just changed hands. That
is what is happening today.
Our country is in bad economic straits because
somebody is hoarding all the money.
I have an opinion as to who hoards all the money, but I am not going to
express it here. I don't feel I have to do that. I think we all understand
the Golden Rule,
"he who has all the gold makes the rules."
There is no real
power among the people of this country. There never has been. We understand
that the political setup in this country is identical to many in the ancient
world.
Just know that the movie being enacted on the screen of the world is
not actually what is going on, but that there are people behind the screen
behind the scenes, that are actually manipulating the play or movie that
most people do not know anything about.
Let's take some of the major religions and find out what is really going on.
Even our motion pictures reflect an occult story, they are telling this
story. For example, the ancient magical priests of the Celtics had magic
wands. And, the magic wands were used to dupe people or to work their magic
on them. Magic wands were always made out of holly wood. Consequently, our
masters still use Hollywood to manipulate our thinking and to tell us
stories.
There is a tremendous amount of symbolism in our motion pictures
today.
There was such a thing as the "Ark of the Law." It was a box with two
handles on it; it had the two winged angels on it, just as we see today in
pictures of the
Ark of the Covenant of the ancient Hebrews. But thousands of
years before the Hebrew nation ever existed we have the "Ark of the Law" of
ancient Egypt. That ark was symbolic for a very powerful force that Egypt
was able to dominate the world with.
With the coming of Western man, the
concepts and ideas coming out of Egypt were adopted.
The same magic is being used today, such as in
Washington, DC.
We see the
obelisk, right there in Washington, and it has a very profound meaning that
dates 32 back to ancient Egypt. And on the back of a one dollar bill we see
a pyramid with an all seeing eye. Pyramids are found in Egypt. Among
esoteric circles throughout the world today, America is referred to as the
new Egypt.
The coming of the new Egypt. All of American's political,
religious, and philosophical systems originated in Egypt. Most people are
not aware of that fact. There are some very important things going on that
we have just not been kept informed about.
Let me first say, that I am in no way finding fault with or knocking
Christianity. I am saying though, that the religious philosophy that we
refer to as Christianity was in fact, at one time already in existence. The
basic theme of Christianity was already in existence in all the ancient
empires especially Egypt. It is interesting to know that a man hanging on a
cross was never pictured in the first four hundred years of Christianity.
They never had a symbol, or an emblem, or a picture anywhere in Christianity
of a man hanging on a cross. It was always pictured as a lamb or a sheep
carrying a cross. It was not until the sixth century at one of the great
ecumenical councils that it was decided that we should have a man hanging on
the cross. That's where the concept of a man hanging on a cross was begun.
There was a man named Jesus. This is historical fact there was a man named
Jesus. His correct name in Hebrew was
Jehoshua Ben-Pandira, or Joshua, son
of the panther. he lived approximately one hundred years before the Jesus of
the Bible would have lived.
This man was a teacher of the Essene religion,
he was a great teacher. he was a healer, etc.
But, a religion grew up in the
Roman Empire that we have come to know today as Christianity. I am saying
that Christianity is, in fact, another expression of a far more ancient
religious philosophy that has all of the earmarks of being one more
retelling of the story. That's why the Bible is referred to as the Greatest
Story Ever Told.
Even the Babylonians had their holy man come down from the
holy mountain with their tablets of stone. They had their Messiah that died
on the cross and who died on the upright tree and who was buried and who was
born again after three days., etc...
This doesn't lessen or in any way take away from the story. No. Not in any
way. This is not saying that Jesus was not the Christ. What I am saying,
though, is that the story may not necessarily be exactly what we think it
is. There is a history to religion that we are not often treated to,
especially in America. We are fond of saying that we have the freedom to
think and have freedom of speech, etc.
That's true. We do have freedom of
speech up to a certain point. But there are certain things that arc not
accepted socially, that we just don't talk about. In my family, many years
ago, we just didn't talk about religion and politics.
Politics and religion
were off base and we simply weren't supposed to talk about them.
The Washington Monument in the District of Columbia.
The capstone of an
obelisk is known as a pyramidion.
Now that I am
much older, I understand why. Because religion and politics are very
volatile subjects, and a lot of political and religious leaders do not want
you to talk about politics and religion.
All of this material being covered
has been hotly debated. It's been debated to the point where most people
say, "Look, I don't care."
What's wrong with that?
Because the more people talk about something the
more they investigate it, the more a subject is discussed, the more it
causes other information comes out. I'm saying it's about time that we do
discuss religion and politics. I think there is a very important connection
between the two, and its about time we look at that connection.
I see
nothing wrong with the teachings of Christianity.
The all-seeing eye of the Illuminati,
as seen on the back of the U.S. dollar
bill.
In fact, I myself adhere and believe the teachings to be a very fine and
fundamental concept, concerning the way to lead one's life.
But you must
understand that it is a story that has been retold and retold and retold.
So, if you understand it correctly what I would call understanding
Christianity you would understand the basic principles that are being
discussed, rather than hanging everything on just a story.
Reason and logic
alone would tell you that you have to ask questions. Did all those people
back in biblical times go around with tape recorders or court stenographers,
and check every single word every prophet spoke, or check up on every
character in the Bible... what he did, where he went, and what he spoke?
Did they have tape recorders?
How do we know that every single word must be exactly that word? And, every
single event must coincide with every single word? There's only one way you
could get a book to coincide and fall in line completely as a beautiful
whole story, as if it was written as a story. So, that is what I'm saying,
the Bible was written as a very beautiful story if you understand that
that's all it was, a story.
Now, there's some good history in the Bible. I am not saying that the Bible
is not the word of God. I just don't believe that it is the only Divine book
written in the world.
If you understand that the world was, at one time, dominated by the Vatican
and there was a World War in fact, there have been two World Wars between
powerful secret societies for power on this Earth. One is the New World
Order as opposed to the old world order. I believe that is why the World
Wars have been fought.
That's why we're having skirmishes all over the
world.
We are not going to achieve a new world order without paying for it in blood
as well as in words and money.
Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in Foreign Affairs
(July/August 1995)
I have two books in my collection right now, one was printed in 1969,
another in 1972, or 1973... talking about how Yugoslavia was going to be
divided between the secret societies.
They were going to go in and cause a
lot of confusion and chaos and break up the status quo there purposely, in
relation to this New World Order coming. So, there's got to be some
connections here between what's happening today when there are very
knowledgeable people that have foretold that these things were going to
happen in Yugoslavia. Nothing happens by happenstance, but this is all being
orchestrated by some small group of people. I truly don't think that there
are a lot of things that happen by chance I don't think the important things
politically are allowed to happen by chance.
Keep in mind when you hear
government officials talk about crime and drugs, saying they can't seem to
get a handle on the drug traffic and they can't seem to get a handle on the
crime in the streets and they're just not able to get a handle on these
serious problems. Just remember that almost sixty years ago the United
States got a handle on Nazi Germany.
They did get control of the standing
army of Adolph Hitler on the other side of the world.
My point is that any crime that goes on or any drug trafficking that goes
on, it is going on with the knowledge and consent if not cooperation of a
very powerful group of people who have their reasons. It might just be to
keep you frightened to death and keep you worried about the future so that
you will accept anything that they give you any kind of idea they will come
up with to distract you from the real truth.
They have the power to shut
down anything they want anytime they please. So if something is going on, it
is going on with their help, or they're allowing it to happen politically.
This is the same thing that happened in Nazi Germany. Adolph Hitler told the
German people that in order to keep the crime off the streets, and avoid all
the trouble that was going on, the confusion, that all they would have to do
is elect him.
Let me just say that I don't believe that the whole world is totally
controlled. But reason and logic alone dictate the possibility of that
happening. Always, anytime a country goes to war or is building up for a
future war, all countries picture their coming enemy as a desperate
murderer, killing babies or whatever. You've got to generate that kind of
furor (Fuhrer!) in the people's minds so that it will justify going to war
with this terrible person or a whole body of people in any given country
like Saddam Hussein.
These hidden agendas are contrived by the media and the press. They led
America, if not instigated the energy, into war with Saddam. This could be
called outright propaganda. Although, it really is NEWS!
It is called the
evening news.
Of course, we see these terrible evil people (on the news).
Then, later on we'll hear that the President has made some kind of an
arrangement with that person and give him fifty billion dollars of our money
and then you see them patting each other on the back, to go off to their
local Masonic lodges together. But come to find out, this is a business
arrangement. Yesterday, this guy was our duplicable enemy and today he is
our friend and we are supporting his agenda.
We are being duped. Throughout
the history of humankind the vast majority of people have been duped by a
few that are in power. We sit here like sitting suckers, with a sign hung
out on our front American lawns, saying, "Come on, here is your next ready
made sucker!"
Today, the American public the plain old ordinary American
public, has been duped from day one. And, we continue to allow this
horrendous duplicity.
A few years ago a movie came out that was called Network. In it, the network
broadcaster said that the general view of the people was, "Just leave me
alone. I don't care about all of this. Just let me have my radial tires, my
beer, my remote control and television, and I'll be numbed-out happy."
Everyday the powers of government keep moving on you little by little, until
one day there is no more freedom.
And that is exactly what is happening in
our country today. In my opinion we have already lost most of our real
freedom to the federal government. What is it that might be coming?
Henry Kissinger said it best.
Today, America would be outraged if U.N.
troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA
Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they
were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an
"extraterrestrial" invasion], whether real or promulgated, that
threatened our very existence.
It is then that all peoples of the world
will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears
is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights
will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being
granted to them by the World Government.
Dr. Henry Kissinger,
Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991
I believe that real freedom is in the mind. In
the intellectual brain. That's where real freedom is happening. And there is
something to do with our spirituality in the mind which brings freedom. That
is the one place that the government fears most, you mind, your thinking.
You ability to be yourself and do your own thinking, call your own shots,
and be your own person.
That's exactly what governments do not want for every world citizen. They
try to keep you busy so that you can pay your bills, pay your taxes, take
care of your house, and when you finish taking care of all the details of
survival, the government hopes you will not have the time, or will try not
to think about some of the things that we have been talking about in this
book.
And, if there is leisure time among much of the population, they will
give you entertainment, to keep you completely distracted anything to
prevent you from thinking more deeply. Just make sure there is plenty of
drugs, plenty of entertainment, a little sex, drugs and rock and roll, and
that will keep the people happy keep them occupied so they will stay out of
the way controlled!
I am not saying that people should not be able to do this. But, it would
behoove you to get an education, read, study, investigate what I am saying
on your own. Take the responsibility to find these things out that I am
reporting here. Go to the library, check out and read something about the
occult world, about how we are manipulated, especially in our politics and
religion. I could provide you with a list of literally hundreds of very
informative and interesting volumes on these subjects.
Today, there are many secret fraternal organization that are interconnected.
They have a death grip on world power, behind the scenes. Our world and
lives are so full of symbolism. For example, once again, on the back of the
American dollar bill, the great seal of America. It is filled with occult
meaning. You will find on the dollar bill, the eagle, which comes from the
ancient concept of the Phoenix, and has thirteen stars above it.
The
thirteen stars are arranged in the configuration of the Star of David, or
the hexagram. Most people think the thirteen stars represent the original
thirteen colonies. In the first place, why did they have to have thirteen
colonies? Why couldn't they have twenty-seven, or four, or ten?
When one
understands that the number thirteen is a very important, profound Masonic
number, and that many of the founding fathers of this country were
Freemasons, as well as Rosicrucians, then you will follow this connecting
thread of material to see what was actually being created. They knew what
they were doing when they divided this country into thirteen colonies.
The
number thirteen is not an unlucky number for them. It is an unlucky number
for you.
The number thirteen comes from Jesus and his twelve apostles. The twelve
apostles were the cornerstones of the new era, and Jesus is referred to as
the "Chief Cornerstone that the builders rejected." Twice in the New
Testament Jesus is referred to as the Chief Cornerstone. Chief Cornerstone
is a Greek word that means "the peak of a pyramid."
That's why there is a
little pyramid on top of a big pyramid on the left-hand side on the back of
a dollar bill. That is a Chief Cornerstone.
It is symbolic of Jesus.
The pyramid also has thirteen layers. As a matter
of fact, thirteen is all over the back of the American one dollar bill. I
would have to say that the Illuminati, under their various guises and names,
run the affairs of the world. Freemasonry is a very ancient fraternal order.
For thousands of years it was made up of many different groups which loosely
fit into an association of builders, going back to the most ancient times in
which men built with bricks such as the pyramids of Egypt, and all the
ancient temples. They were brick builders.
Even today we refer to one
working with bricks as a brick mason. The trade of a mason, or the
conceptual idea of building with bricks, was a building trade. There were
men who did nothing but that, and they were referred to as brick masons.
They came down through ancient history and began to jealously guard each
other's work, and not let any newcomers come into the trade.
They had
"unions," so to speak. We do the same thing today. Later on in 1717 many
occult orders and many of the building trade orders of Freemasonry came
together in London and began what we call Freemasonry, on the modern-day
scale. Modern-day Freemasonry was started in 1717, but the idea goes back to
ancient Egypt and other ancient civilizations.
If you understand that the ancient masons built their world with brick, then
you understand why today's Freemasons say of themselves that they are the
modern day builders of the world. They not only build the building that you
live in and do business in, they are building the structure of the world, as
Freemasons. They are building your religions, your political establishments
all you have to do is go to the library and get reference books on flags,
national coats of arms, symbols and emblems of different countries, and
different international organizations.
They are all Freemasonic symbols.
Also interesting is the fact that a lot of the graffiti that is being seen
in large cities throughout this country are Masonic symbols. Only high
degree Freemasons would know that. A lot of the black gangs and the Mexican
gangs spread graffiti around our cities. Much of that graffiti is very
powerful Masonic symbolism.
This leads me to wonder how these kids know
those symbols. I am suggesting that there is some connection between occult
Freemasonry and the spread of violence and crime in our country. I think we
had better look at some very uncomfortable, but very positively important
connections that can be made between crime on the streets, and the elitist
people that run this country who are allowing it to happen. There's a
reason. I think that crime in this country is being allowed for a purpose.
A
lot of people may feel this way, but nobody is saying it publicly.
Now, we must ask, where is this going?
Where are the occult orders that
control most of the important political and religious events of this world
trying to lead this planet? I think that for hundreds of years there has
been a concerted effort to lead the world into a New World Order a
completely new civilization where human beings will no longer be the same
type of humans that they were in the past. We are being guided into a new
age.
There is a New World Order that is being orchestrated. All the violence
and destruction that we are seeing today is destroying the old order in
preparation for a new order. You cannot construct a high rise building where
there is an old shack, until you tear down the old shack.
Today, we are having wars and bloodshed everywhere so that we can destroy
the power base of "the good ol' boys" in different countries, then a "New
World Order" can be set up. I cannot escape the conclusion that there is
someone very, very high up and extremely wise and perceptive as to how to
make things happen to bring about a certain conclusion. I tend to believe
that that being or entity is something spiritual.
I believe there is
something spiritual happening in our world today. But it also uses men
powerful people. And these powerful men often get greedy, and may not follow
their "higher calling" properly. They are only human, and power is
intoxicating. I am concerned for the future because of the loss of
individuality and the loss of the human ability, freedom and the liberty to
think.
That is one thing about this country I am thankful for that we have
the opportunity to discuss things intelligently with each other and give
each other the opportunity to be heard because that is how we grow. However,
I think that personal evolution is being stifled.
More and more the governmental powers from behind the scenes are quietly
making sure that people don't talk too much about things that are
controversial. I think that human minds are being remolded, and reprogrammed
so that people don't really have to think a whole lot anymore. We just go
along to get along and whatever the government says, we do, whatever the
church says, we do, and whatever our assigned authorities say to do, we do.
I think that that is where the real problem is going to exist.
Let's step back a moment and consider the Vatican as it existed in the time
of A.D. 600's. The Earth was regarded as being the center of the Universe.
People were controlled by the Church. They lived for the Church. The only
hope they had was that they would go to heaven, and not to hell. And
everything else was basically business as usual. That worked quite well for
hundreds of years.
But this system became rather difficult to uphold when
people found out that the Earth wasn't the center of the Universe. Then the
Church began to lose a lot of its credibility and power. Now, I think a few
people are trying to gain similar power and control over people, but not
necessarily through the Church. They are trying to regain such power through
new secular means because the people have been infected with this idea of
freedom and liberty and individual rights to think for themselves.
Consequently, the Church is not going to operate well. Churches never
operate well in an environment where people are allowed to be themselves and
do their own thinking and call their own shots in their lives. So now,
instead of being afraid of going to hell, people are being conditioned
to be
afraid of total destruction through world wars, or environmental collapse,
or some other terrible catastrophe coming, even an alien invasion.
There is
enough out there that some very brilliant people can come up with something
that will scare the life out of all of us.
Not to mention that nature itself can be very frightening with such
phenomena as volcanoes, earthquakes, etc. And, I wonder how much of that is
man-made. There is a considerable high technology in this world that is
operational, too. The underlying agenda has been control, and more control
through fear. So one of the basic messages I am trying to get across is to
rid yourself of fear. Rid yourself of fear and educate yourself. Become
informed as broadly as you possibly can.
Go to the library and check out
books on the occult history of this world.
A word of warning. The word occult has been grossly misrepresented by the
media. Most people, when they hear the word occult, think immediately of
demons and the boogey man. This is yet another way we are being manipulated
because we are being told, over and over again, that there is something
mysterious and dark and unnerving, and something very fearful about the
occult.
Everything else is okay, we are told. Religion is fine. But the
occult offers something that is very dangerous. Once you understand what is
going on, you find out that some very crafty people have not told you what
they are doing and how they are doing it, and they are working some real
heavy duty magic upon you. You are nothing more than a sitting duck, because
you don't understand the process.
The word occult means hidden. That, simply, is all it means. Anything that
is hidden is occult. I'm talking about the hidden powers behind the throne;
the hidden powers behind religion; the hidden innuendoes behind everyday
symbolism. People who have accepted the authorities as the truth find it
very difficult to accept the truth as authority.
Authority does not always
come with the truth. And, truth does not always come with authority. The
bottom line is, no matter what you believe, there is a truth that resonates
with your heart and everyone else. There is a factual truth that can be
pointed out, but you have to look for it. If, however, you go along to get
along; if you accept your government's view of everything, and if you accept
your particular religious persuasion of things, then you are no different
than the Hindus, the Buddhists, the Muslims and all the other people we
condemn throughout the world or those silly radicals who follow the views of
their leaders and blow up buildings without asking questions.
We may, like
them, find ourselves being in wars and killing people without even
questioning this authority, because they are doing it for the Lord. In what
way are we any different if we do the same?
What is important is that you maintain your own individuality as an
intelligent human being, and do your own homework so your thinking becomes
grounded in the truth.
In this particular time in which we are living, to be able to speak freely,
is going to be very important in the very near future. Our freedoms are
being very closely watched, and are being monitored. There is the
possibility that we are going to lose our freedom of speech quite soon. On
this planet there are no passengers, we're all crew, so we all have a stake
in what is happening in this world. Whether we want to deal with it or not,
we have to face what is going on in the world around us, and especially with
our rights as free citizens.
H.G. Wells said that,
"Civilization is nothing more than a race between
education and catastrophe."
And, that is what we have coming. Catastrophe is
looking at us from all corners of the globe. Certainly, from the standpoint
of the New World Order.
The Talmud states that,
"If there is no knowledge,
then there is no understanding."
If there is no understanding, then there is
no knowledge, and that's what we have today. A whole lot of no
understanding. It is about time for people who do know, to speak up.
President Woodrow Wilson once said,
"If you want to make enemies, just try
to change something."
So, I know that anyone who tries to bring to the
public the facts behind the world that we live in, is going to be criticized
and condemned. I believe that there are enough people in this world who want
to know the truth and who want to be willing to stand and fight for it. Not
in the violent, literal sense, but with higher moral values, upholding free
ethical standards, and a deeper understanding to be well-informed.
Let me explain one of the main problems and tragedies in the world today. In
the case of one who knows, or has wisdom, he is usually aware that he
doesn't know everything. It is usually the man who thinks he knows
everything, who doesn't know anything. One of the most important ways of
learning anything today in our society is through symbols and emblems.
Emblems are like words. If you can't read the emblems or symbols, you don't
know what the story is revealing. This is especially true in religion. We
are seeing so much in what is said to be religion, and, in fact, it is
nothing more than politics. And, of course, politics are religion, and
religion is politics. There has never been a religious movement on Earth
that wasn't a little political.
And, there has never been a political
movement that didn't have a little religion involved in it.
I want to focus on the religion that is prominent in our country, and that
is Christianity. Before I get into this subject, I want to emphasize that I
don't appreciate anyone placing anyone else into a narrow box, or
pigeon-holing me and deciding who I am in my belief systems, or where I am
coming from. Because, if you don't know me, you don't know where I am coming
from. I am not a Communist.
I am not a Nazi, I am not a racist, I am just a
human being with something to say. I belong to no political party,
consequently, I am not coming from any particular place. I am just a human
being, a researcher, a teacher, and an investigative writer. I enjoy doing
what I do, and have been centered for over thirty-five years doing what I
do, and it's about time I bring my work to the public.
Now we see in this country, on television, a lot about Christianity. We see
Presidents, and Congressmen, and Senators, and everybody all the Civic
leaders are all into Christianity and going to church and being fine people.
However, for being fine people, we find that many are not really fine. As a
matter of fact, an honest politician, these days, is one who did not take a
bribe that he didn't earn. So, let's face it, our system of government has
fallen apart. It is collapsing all around us, and the reason why is that it
is built on lies. Perhaps one of the greatest lies, or misconceptions, and
let's be generous here to maybe identify some misunderstandings, is the
truth about Christianity.
I would like to deal with Christianity first and
get that out of the way, because until such time as the people understand
where Christianity came from, how it was organized, and why it teaches what
it does, you're not going to understand the mentality behind it. And, we are
talking about a white mentality.
If we go back, say ten to fifteen thousand years ago into the ancient world,
you should understand that they didn't have the modern-day conveniences that
we do. They didn't have the television to occupy their time and waste their
lives. They didn't have the nice warm homes and cars and all such things to
keep them occupied.
Those were very hostile times in an inhospitable world.
It was fearful and cold, and very difficult for human beings to survive.
Most especially in Europe. Most adults died from around twenty-five to
thirty years of age. It was a very hostile world for humans to live, to eke
out the barest of existence.
We are talking, again, about ten to fifteen thousand year ago. It was
obvious from the beginning, according to the best material that has been
provided to us from history, and that's the best we have from the ancient
records, that the first enemy for man, was darkness. The first thing man
realized that was frightening to his world, was just plain darkness.
It was
bad enough to live through the daytime, but when the sun went down it got
scary, because there were predator animals out there, there were enemies
lurking in the bush. So nighttime became very fearful to our first hominids.
When you understand that kind of a world, and those conditions, from there
you begin to appreciate how they perceived the coming of that orb of day, or
the Sun, as something to look forward to with relief. Because when the Sun
went down, you got nothing to look forward to but potentially frightful
problems.
And, of course, if you have ever been out on a cold night, you can
imagine what our first ancestors fifteen thousand years ago had to look
forward to when it got real cold at night. You can then appreciate why they
would look forward to the coming of the Sun, or the coming of that great orb
of day.
Now, if you begin to see how these philosophies would come into people's
minds and begin to grow, and their children growing up would begin to accept
the same philosophies and ideas and promote them to their children, and
their children to their children, you begin to see how the philosophy became
one of "war" between light and darkness. That which was light was good, of
course, because the light was usually peaceful, and it was good, and that
which was dark was bad.
Thereby, this primitive understanding was the basis for this animosity
between the light and darkness. Well, we know we have seen a lot of that,
because that is carried over into our society sociologically, regarding the
war between light and darkness. As I said, light was good, and dark was bad.
The Sun, of course, was the light of the world, and they understood that.
The ancients were not stupid.
They saw that the Sun was not God. They never
believed that the Sun was God, but they believed that it was the
reproduction of God, it was the offspring of God, it was the closest symbol
that they could grasp to represent deity in heaven. So they figured that
since your son looks a lot like you, well maybe God looks a lot like the
Sun, or that the Sun looks a lot like the Father.
So they realized this
about the Sun, and I am using the word as an Anglo-Saxon word today. The orb
in the sky, or whatever you want to call it, back then was understood to be
the descendant of the Father, who was the Creator of the Heavens. So,
therefore, they realized that this Sun did not belong to anyone, it belonged
to the heavens, or it belonged to God, so it was God's Son. Every morning it
was in the sky, or it was in heaven, so, therefore, God's Son was in heaven.
As I said, it was the Son, or the offspring of the Father.
They believed that no one has ever seen the Father. No one can see God, but
if the Sun looks like God, then maybe the Sun/Son mimicked God. So, when you
have
seen the Sun/Son, then maybe you have seen the Father.
Now, incidentally, it is interesting as to why the ancients believed that
God was a father, because in the most ancient world they associated the
creation of the humans, the creation on the Earth, with the Mother. It was
only until the coming of the early Roman Empire that the emphasis was put on
the male. As contrasted to the African, which is based on the female
principle.
And even the Greeks borrowed many things from Africa, with one
example being the Feast of Sophia, which was based on feminine wisdom. And,
as I said, the ancient people knew that no one had ever seen God, no one can
see God, but if you have seen the Sun/Son, you have seen the Father. The
reason why the ancients believed this postulate, as some of the ancient
people believed that God was a father, was because of rain.
Rain was
perceived to be the fluid from the Father that gives a life, or brings life
to Mother Earth. So, when Mother Earth is impregnated with the fluid from
the Father in Heaven, then the Mother gives birth to all life. So that is
where the concept of God the Father comes from, from rain.
The area that we call today, Israel, was in very ancient times called Cana.
The people there called Canaanites, and they celebrated the great marriage
feast, so to speak, between God, the Father, and Mother Earth, and all of
the light that the two of them produced for us.
This very ancient
celebration was in the Spring, and was called The Marriage Feast of Cana.
This was where God's Son was symbolically asked by Mother Earth to draw
water to make it rain, so that the grapes could grow and we could have a
wine feast, which was called The Marriage Feast of Cana. That's where that
comes from.
Of course, the sun gives life to us, and gives us our energy. It gives
energy to all living things. Then, we eat those living things to give us
energy, so the sun is giving up its energy for us to live. Just as the
ancients believed that God's Son gave His life, so that we may live. The
Sun/Son, of course, represented this, which is interesting, because the
ancient Egyptians said that as long as the sun comes up in the morning,
there is going to be life. There is obviously going to be life forever, as
long as the sun comes up!
Therefore, the sun gives everlasting life on the
Earth
but not for you, only on the Earth is there everlasting life. Of course,
God's Son is our Savior, in that he is risen. Moreover, the ancients said
that the sun, as wonderful as it was, was not going to save anybody if it
did not come up in the morning. If it doesn't come up in the morning, we are
dead. he is our Salvation, he is our Savior, only if he has risen.
And the
Egyptians called that risen sun in the morning, Horus. Horus was God's son,
that was the name they came up for him in Egypt. Horus. And, they said that
in the morning all Egyptians would get up to see the Sun come up, like an
Easter sunrise service, and they would see the Son/Sun come up as he was
rising. You would go out to see Horns, and he is risen. That's why even
today the sun comes up on the Horus-risen or the horizon.
You had better thank the Father for sending His Sun/Son, because he is your
life, and he is your salvation. Ancients breathed a sigh of relief when they
saw the sun come up, because they became more secure in their world. When
they saw the sun come up everything became clear, and they could see all the
animals, and they tion of the Prince of Peace, because everyone felt much
better when the sun came up.
So, he was then considered the Prince of Peace.
Now, as we've said, the sun in Egypt was called Horus when it rose in the
morning. And that is where he had twelve segments of his lifespan in the
daytime. Half of 24 hours, or 12 hours of light. That's where we get the
word hours, hours come from Horns. Hours, or Horus. So therefore, the sun
would come up on the horizon.
It is interesting, too, in the Egyptian way of
thinking, that there was a second Sun/Son. God had a second son, who was
equal to the first, but was bad. If you are familiar with Egyptian
mythology, you would know that his name was Set, and, of course, Set was the
evil son. he was dark, so that made him evil, and he would only come out as
the Prince of Darkness after dark at sun-set. So, of course it got dark
after the sun went down, so Set came out when it got dark and became the
boogey-man who was going to get you, since he was dark.
Therefore, that made
him bad.
Now you have the two brothers. Horus and Set, one was light and one was
darkness. The original trinity in Egypt was the three life spans of the sun,
or the
three life spans in life. Morning, noon, and night. With people we
have the newborn, the mature, and the dying. This is where we got the
original concept for the trinity. In Egypt, Horus was the beginning, the sun
coming up on the horizon, which was the newborn.
Then, at twelve noon, the
sun was high over the pyramid. There was no shadow on the pyramid, so they
knew it was twelve, therefore, he was called at
that point the "most high," as you couldn't go any higher in the sky.
So
Horus was called the most high. Therefore you have in the morning God's
Sun/Son, Horns, and then the "most high" at twelve noon, and then at night
you have Set. From there you have your original trinity.
The religion has taken all sorts of twists and turns coming down through
history, but this is the basis for what we call today, Christianity. If you
don't understand that, then you don't appreciate where the stories originate
from. It has always amazed me how many people will understand Christianity,
but not understand that Christianity is nothing more than a retelling of the
same age-old stories that have come down through time.
As a matter of fact,
the Bible is not called the greatest collection of facts ever assembled.
No,
it is called "the greatest story ever told."
The reason why it is the greatest story ever told is because if you do a
little homework, you're going to find out it is the oldest story ever told.
As a matter of fact, it is the only story ever told.
It is called astro-theology,
the study and the worship of the heavens.
If you go out in the night time and look into the sky, what are you looking
at? You are looking at the sky. What is another name for the sky. Another
word for sky, is heaven. Well, that is where the sun is at. At
twelve noon
the sun is high in heaven, so, therefore, they said that God's Sun/Son was
in heaven.
Of course, they never believed that when they died they would go
to heaven with God's sun.
At least, they knew that much. At twelve noon the
sun was the most high, consequently they said that God's Son was twelve when
he was in God's temple. God's temple was, of course, the heavens, and at
twelve noon he is in the temple. That is why he was twelve when he was in
the temple.
Everlasting life came from God's sun. And the sun was round. It was a circle
in the sky. So the ancients saw life as a round circle, "the circle of
life," which was pictured or represented by the sun. The way they kept time,
then, was on a round calendar. Today we call them sundials. That's where
they came from, the round calendars. As a matter of fact, the Aztecs, and
the Mayans, and the ancient Mexicans kept the round sun calendars.
Now the
sun calendars that were in Egypt were round and were divided into twelve
parts, just as all sun calendars are today, twelve parts, displaying not
only twelve hours, but twelve months. Each one of the months was called a
helper to the sun, because it helped the sun do his job on Earth in that
particular month.
Later on, those particular months were called houses, because in the
Babylonian scheme of things they began to develop what was called astrology.
So each one of the months became a house. Therefore, the Sun, God's Son, the
light of the world, who is our salvation, because he has risen, had twelve
helpers, or twelve apostles.
And the sun also enters into each one of those
houses of the zodiac, or each one of those constellations of the zodiac, at
the thirtieth degree, and it leaves at the thirty-third degree. Therefore,
they said that the Sun/Son begins His ministry at thirty and dies at
thirty-three. This is very, very old knowledge, as a matter of fact, there
are many books that trace at least fifteen other major religions that have
used God's Son as the "light of the world" in the same context, in the same
religious philosophy that was developed for the worship of God's sun.
Yes,
there were at least fifteen other major religions, ancient religions, that
used the story. One of the reference books that documents this, right off
the top of my head, is The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors, by Kersey
Graves.
The circled cross found on many church steeples represents the sun dying on
the cross of the zodiac.
The cycle of four seasons is also displayed.
The sun on the cross associated with bell symbolism within a sacred archway.
There are so many interesting points that I feel are valuable to bring out
in relation to the subject of religion. Christianity has always labeled
these ancient religions as being pagan, which gives a negative connotation.
The word pagan actually means someone who lives in the country, a mountain
dweller, or someone who lives outside of a city.
That name was given to
someone who lived up in the mountains, because in Rome, after Christianity
was adopted, the religion was thought to be sophisticated. There was little
sophistication to be found outside of the cities. Once Caesar became a
Christian then everybody could be a Christian, so therefore, it became the
State religion. So it was in high style to be a Christian. Consequently, you
were considered very intelligent if you became a Christian at that time, you
were very in, you were modern if you were a Christian in Rome.
Once it was
accepted fully, and then it became the thing to be. Of course, the people
out in the hills, the farmers, the poor people out in the country, on the
outside of Rome that have lived the same way for ten thousand years, well,
those were pagans. They didn't understand a new "take" on things.
So it
became a disparaging remark about poor people of the soil, people who were
farmers, people who didn't know all of this high-fangled, new religious
thing that Rome had come up with as a new belief system.
The cross with the circle of
the sun is a very common symbol,
in both ancient and modern
times.
They were just people, and the working class
people were called pagans. That is where the word came from in ancient
times. Anybody who wasn't with the "in" crowd in Rome, with the new
religion, was considered a pagan.
Now, let us get back to the sundial. The sundial was round because the sun
was round. It kept track of the months because it was divided into twelve
equal parts. While this might be dry religious philosophy being discussed,
it has a motive at the end, so I caution you to not disregard this
discussion too quickly, because it is going to get interesting very soon.
The connection with the rest of this material will be revealed.
Now, as we have said, the calendar was divided into twelve parts, or the
twelve helpers of the sun, and that is where we get the twelve apostles of
the Son. The ancient peoples came to notice something very interesting, as
they were very observant. Unlike us, we are too busy these days to observe
anything. The ancient people had time to observe, and they found out
something that is interesting during winter, on what we call the Winter
Solstice.
Up to December 22nd, the Sun had kept moving. Each day the sun
kept moving on a little portion of the sundial. You could tell each day that
the sun was moving by watching the sundial.
As the sun was moving further
and further South, bringing on our Winter, they would notice that it would
go further and further, until it stopped, and then they said,
"Thank God,
the thing has stopped, because if it keeps going its going to be gone
completely."
So, it stopped, and it stopped on December 22nd. Then they
noticed that for three days, on December 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, every morning
it was still sitting in the same place. It had not moved any further and
hadn't returned back the other way any further.
So, they figured that
anything that didn't move, must be dead. Consequently, they assumed that the
sun must be dead. On the 25th, they noticed that the sun had moved the
opposite way one degree, so again they assumed that the thing must be alive
now. Therefore, December 25th was the Sun/Son's birthday. But before that
they said that God's Sun/Son had died, and been dead for three days.
Of course, we have the big celebration of God's Son being born on December
25th, the sun's "birthday." So, now when you take that round calendar, with
twelve individual months, or twelve helpers, or apostles, you divide the
circle from the Winter Solstice, which is the middle of Winter, right down
through the circle and to the bottom, which would be the Summer Solstice.
You then draw another straight line from the other side and go across,
making a cross, that is when the Spring Equinox, occurs, and into the Autumn
Equinox. Now you've got a circle with a cross in it. That is why today
almost all churches that you drive by will have the circle in the cross,
mounted on the steeple. People normally don't notice, but look next time. It
is usually there.
The circle is the sun that dies on the cross of the zodiac. On the ancient
calendar, you divide the Winter and the Summer Solstice from the Autumn and
Spring Equinox, thereby creating a cross on the circle, and the circle is
the Sun/Son dying on the cross.
As we said, the sun was born on December 25th, and every year they said that
the sun was "born again." Now, for you to be born again, that means that you
have to go under water to be born again. Why? You know of the common
Christian religious ritual, that you must be baptized under water to be born
again. Where does that come from?
That comes from the fact that when you
were born the first time, your Mother broke water and you were submerged in
water for the first time.
So, if you are going to be born again, you have got to go back under the
water again. Nothing holy about it, just plain old life. And, that's the way
philosophies came about in the world. People just looked at the world around
them, watched the way things worked, and had to get in line with it. They
couldn't make the Universe do what they wanted, so they had to get in line
with it to form their religious philosophies and ideas from what was there.
So, the baptism had to do with the Mother's water, rather than the River
Jordan! It had nothing to do with the River Jordan (except in a symbolic
way).
Now for more on the sun. Light was always associated with truth and the lie
was always the work of darkness. Therefore, the Sun/Son was the light and
the truth. And, he brought the truth and the light. As a matter of fact, it
is said of the Son that he was the truth and the light. That is why,
incidentally, that we have in our jury system today in America twelve jurors
(or sun's "helpers"), who helped bring the truth to light.
Also, about Winter time. Winter was always associated with death, because in
the Winter everything dies. So Winter was always associated with death, and,
of course, the sun dies in Winter. And, this is a very important point. They
said of the sun that when it died on December 22nd, that it had "passed
over." We use that term today, that when you pass on, when you pass away,
you pass over. The sun had passed over to the death of Winter, to the coming
new life of Spring. So that in the Spring he came back to life. And also
brought life back to the Earth.
So he had passed over, he had passed on, or
passed away.
The ancient Egyptians had a celebration on the first day of Spring, and they
called it the Passover. They celebrated the Passover, because the sun had
passed over from the death of Winter, to the new life of Spring. That's
where the Passover ritual comes from. On the first day of Spring all of a
sudden everything that is dead, now comes alive again.
Therefore, God's
Sun/Son is bringing everything to life back on the Earth again, as he is the
symbol of everlasting life. And, as I previously said, that new life is for
the Earth, but not for you. The particular month that he comes back in the
Spring with new life was, in the most ancient calendars, in Virgo, the
Virgin. Therefore, it was said that God's Son/Son was born of a virgin.
That
is where that came from in our religious views.
The old Age of Pisces, or the old age of the fishes, when God's Son feeds
his people with the two fishes, is a little over two thousand years old in
length.
Each one of the constellations is two thousand years in length, in
the astrological scheme of things. So, the constellation of Pisces began
about two thousand years ago, with the rule of Rome. And Rome was said to
have ruled under the Age of Pisces, the two fishes, and that is why we get
the idea that God's Son fed the people with the two fishes.
The closing of this age also signifies why the
"New World Order" is taking power from the "Old World," or Rome, at the end
of this Piscean Age.
After the decline of Egypt, Rome came into power and picked up many Egyptian
ideas and customs. It's just like everything else, everyone borrows from
everybody else, we think we don't, but we do. One person comes out with a
smashing movie, and four others then come out with the same general movie.
So everyone borrows from everyone else, and that's true of religion.
The
only problem is understanding who had the original concept. All of this
began in Egypt. With Egypt we are talking about Africa, and in Africa we are
talking about black people.
So we have each one of those ages being about two thousand years long, each
one of the constellation ages, and we have God's Sun/Son, the light of the
world, coming into the Age of Pisces with the coming of the rule of Rome.
That is why the Pope has the fish's hat, the fish's miter.
The hat of the
Pope is actually the fish of Dagon, or the fish God of the two fishes.
Now,
we have been in that astrological period of time under which God's Sun/Son
has ruled the world in the Age of Pisces for right around two thousand
years. And an age, or eon, is a little over two thousand years in length.
That means we are just over two thousand years into the Age of Pisces. The
next age to come, if you look at any astrological chart, is the Age of
Aquarius.
Therefore, we are living in "the last days," of the Age of Pisces.
When the Messiah comes again, he is asked by his disciples in the Book of
Luke, 22:10, what he will come back as. he says to go into the town and go
into the house of the man with the water pitcher. So here is the Sun/Son,
symbolized in Pisces, and the rest of the astrological "signs" (12
"disciples") are asking him what he will do next, when he gets to the end of
Age of Pisces.
We are now going into the age of the man with the water
pitcher. The man with the water pitcher is the symbol for Aquarius. Again, I
have to say that the Bible is filled with astrology. It is not known for
astrology, and that is what we have to qualify. Once you look at it
differently, the symbolism becomes obvious and it is all over the place.
The
Bible writers knew exactly what they were doing.
Of course, ministers never point this out on Sundays in church. In
Christianity they denounce astrology as being evil. Christians say that
astrology is evil and bad, from the Devil. Add a "d" to evil, and you have
Devil. Take an "o" out of good, and you have God. In the Old Testament,
Moses says to God's people to have nothing to do with astrologers, with
those who can foretell the future by the stars. So we wouldn't want anything
to do with astrology either. Moses didn't, and demanded his people have
nothing to do with those people who could read the stars.
The understanding of that is this in the Old Testament, there are four
separate and distinct gods being discussed, but we've been unaware of that.
This is due to the priesthood who put that Old Testament together, and you
weren't there, so you don't know this fact. The priesthood knew that there
were four different deities.
One of the four deities was the Sun, or Solar. That is where we get Solomon,
King Solomon from. Sol being the Latin for the Sun, Om being Hindu for the
Sun, and On was the city of the Sun in Egypt. Sol Om On. Just three
different names for the same deity. Think of that next time you flip "on" a
light switch. So one of the gods in the Old Testament was the Sun.
The
others were approached through the predominant cults of the time. One was of
the stellar cult. The old Hebrew stellar group connected themselves with
their God through the stars. Then there was the moon cult, or the lunar
cult, of which Moses was the leader. So you have the solar cult, the star
cult, and the moon (or lunar) cult accounting for three of those Old
Testament gods (we'll get to the fourth one soon).
Moses was the Hebrew leader of the lunar cult, while Jehovah, or Yahweh, was
the lunar God. He was El before that, and that goes back into the ancient
Semitic, which in turn goes back to the planet Saturn.
But Moses, being a
worshipper of a
lunar God, El, or Jehovah, naturally would not want to have
anything to do with the other group across the street or down the block who
worshiped a different God, who worshiped the stars. That is why Moses would
tell his followers not to have anything to do with the star worshipers.
After sundown the moon comes out. That is why Moses would have all the holy
days at sundown, because that is when the moon comes out. One of the main
reasons why the moon, or the lunar, was worshiped by Moses' followers was
because the moon had control over the women's menstrual cycle. Since they
were into sex worship, that is one of the primary reasons why they worshiped
the moon. The old lunar cults were sex worshipers.
This brings us to the subject of circumcision.
Now, what does cutting the
foreskin off of a boy's penis got to do with the Lord? It doesn't have a
thing to do with the Lord, it has to do with sex. That is why you are
messing around with the boy's penis. They had the boys circumcised because
they found out that a man would get aroused quicker, without the foreskin
than he would with the foreskin. That was not new with the Hebrews, this
ritual goes way back to stone age man. The Egyptians did the same thing,
preparing boys for a little sex worship.
We now are faced with a new scripture, in the Christian context, with Jesus,
or God's Son, saying that in my house are many mansions. The problem with
this is that is not the exact translation in the Bible. The King James
version mistranslates the Bible a lot.
You have to understand why, because
the old British, the old Anglo-Saxon British, were not that keen on Hebrew
and Greek. They did the best they could, but they still mistranslated a lot.
They know that.
Originally translated, it should be,
"In my Father's abode
there are many houses."
Well sure, there are at least twelve that we know of
the twelve houses of the zodiac. So, in my Father's abode there are many
houses. That's what God's "Sun" was specifying. King James was a wonderful
man, I know, but his lackeys just didn't know Hebrew and Greek well enough
to translate things correctly.
Later on we see that the Son is betrayed, and of course, he is betrayed by
Judas, or Scorpio, being November, or in the Fall of the year. That is when
the rays are cut short. Samson's hair is cut short, or the Sun/Son's rays
are cut short in the winter, so he dies. What we are talking about, again,
is astrology.
We can go back into the ancient world for the understanding of many modern
day concepts, and to understand the Bible and the light of truth. We never
quite revealed in the Bible what was always associated with light.
The light
was also associated with telling the truth about something, and if you have
good knowledge on something, then people say that you are brilliant, you are
in the light, you are enlightened.
As the ancient Egyptians said, if you put
the truth out of your mind when someone is giving you the truth, and is
showing you the truth, what you are doing is killing the light of truth. It
is the same as killing God's Son, the light of truth, when you are killing
the truth in your head, in your brain. That is where you are cutting off the
light of truth in your mind.
Therefore, they said that God's Sun/Son was
killed, was put to death on Golgottha, "Skull Place," as they called it.
That's where the brain is, in your skull. Skull Place is where you put the
truth and the light to death. The light of truth, God's Son, has always been
impaled between two thieves. There is regret for the past and fear of the
future. We've always put the death of light between two thieves.
The sun has been used by Kings, rulers, potentates and every kind of ruler
and institution worldwide has used it on their flags, emblems, symbols,
police badges, just about everywhere. The sun symbol has been used by
everybody, that is why it is called King of Kings, Lord of Lords.
The sun was said also to have died with a crown of thorns. All you have to
do is fly over the Statue of Liberty to see the crown of thorns, because the
crown of thorns is nothing more than the sun's rays. When the sun is dying
in the evening you can go out to the ocean and see the sun walking on water.
What do you see? You see the sun rays, dying with a crown of thorns.
It is
also said that the way God's Sun/Son left, is the way that he is coming
back. On a cloud. That is usually the way the sun leaves, on a could,
normally, in the morning, if there are some clouds. He comes up on a cloud.
The way he left is on a cloud, and the way he returns is on a cloud. The
Bible says that every eye is going to see God's Son when he comes back.
Well, you have to be dead or blind not to see the sun.
There's a story about God's Son during a storm, the great tempest in the
Bible. God's Son was sleeping and the storm was so bad that the men on the
ship, the seasoned sailors, just wanted to die, commit suicide, because it
was so rough. But God's Son was downstairs in the ship sleeping. Everybody
else on the boat is going to die, they are scared to death, and he is
sleeping.
Now, I have heard about sound sleepers, but a man continues to
sleep right through this terrible storm, and he doesn't even hear it raging.
Just understand that the Sun does control weather, it controls the storms on
the sea because when it comes out, the storms leave.
The ancients knew this,
they knew that the sun controlled the seas.
So this is yet another story
about the physical sun, disguised as an interesting parable that will give
us all hope about the return of our "savior."
So we see ourselves coming to an end about what Christianity reveals.
I just
wanted to give a background, to show the astro-theology, or the astrological
aspects of the Bible taken from the ancient texts, Egypt in particular, and
how these symbols and sayings have developed right into modern day thinking.
Also, how this has developed into a political ideology, and leads into
some premises, views, and values, and of course, the associations around
secret societies.
