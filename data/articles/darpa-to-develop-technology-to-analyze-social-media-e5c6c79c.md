A contract proposal from the Defense
Departments
research arm DARPA revealed the
Pentagon is looking to develop computer algorithms which would mine data
from social media websites and use it to track and analyze the behavior of
various criminal and terrorist groups (h/t
Mashable).
In order to understand group dynamics and
forecast trends, the DOD hopes to understand how a group evolves,
interacts, recruits, influences other groups and affect the opinions of
individuals and communities.
In phase 1, DARPA wants a system developed which would first track groups
and their state changes and research key indicators of interactions.
In phase 2, the system developed would learn
the,
dynamics of group behavior and inter- and
intra-group interactions in an unsupervised manner,
...then achieve a 90% accuracy rate in detecting
state changes in 1,000 groups with a combined total of more than a million
members with 100,000 postings a day.
Phase 3, prototype development, would:
be of great interest to industrial
espionage prevention specialists, law enforcement, market analysts, and
polling organizations. This capability would be applicable to a broad
range of tactical as well as strategic military operations.
While only in the proposal phase, such desires
from the military should send chills down the spine of anyone interested in
protecting civil liberties.
The DOD might purport to be interested in using
such technology for the purposes of understanding terrorist or criminal
groups, weve already seen the
increased criminalization of dissent.
Many American law enforcement agencies
have had their eyes and ears on activist
groups that use Twitter, Facebook and other social media
outlets, cell phone carriers and other forms of electronic communication as
a way of spreading ideas and organizing protests.
Tracking and predicting group behavior in the
hands of any government or military entity is just another tool in an ever
increasing armory of weapons against dissenters.
