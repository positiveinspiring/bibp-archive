The Trilateral Commission
The Trilateral Commission was founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller and
Zbigniew Brzezinski. It has headquarters in New York, Paris, and Tokyo.
It is said to be funded by the tax-exempt giants
like Ford, Lilly Endowment, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the German Marshall
Fund, and corporations such as Time, Bechtel, Exxon, General Motors,
Wells-Fargo, etc.
Its membership is composed of past and present presidents, ambassadors,
secretaries of state, Wall Street investors, NATO and pentagon military
personnel, international bankers, foundation executives, media owners,
university presidents and professors, senators and congressmen, and wealthy
industrialists and entrepreneurs.
"The Trilateral Commission was formally
established in 1973 and consisted of leaders in business, banking,
government, and mass media from North America, Western Europe, and
Japan," wrote James Perloff.
"David Rockefeller was founding chairman and
Brzezinski founding director of the North American branch, most of whose
members were also in the CFR," he added. Author Jim Marrs announced,
"With the blessing of the Bilderbergers and the CFR, the Trilateral
Commission began organizing on July 23-24, 1973 at the 3,500-acre
Rockefeller estate at Pocantico Hills, a subdivision of Tarrytown, New
York."
Its existence is a proven fact as verified by
mainstream news sources such as Time Magazine, the Wall Street Journal, U.S.
News and World Report, and The Washington Post, as well as multiple books
including,
-
Trilaterals Over Washington, by
Professor Antony Sutton and Patrick M. Wood
-
America's Secret Establishment, by
Professor Antony Sutton
-
Dark Majesty by Professor Texe Marrs (no
known relation to Jim Marrs)
-
The Shadows of Power, by James Perloff,
...and others.
Professor Antony Sutton wrote,
"The organization is completely above
ground. In fact," he stated, "this author has openly debated with George
Franklin, Jr., ... of the Trilateral Commission on the radio. Mr.
Franklin did show a rather ill-concealed dislike of the assault on his
pet global New World Order - and made the mistake of attempting to
disguise this objective."
The Trilateral Commission has an official
publication called, Trialogue.
It also issues multiple Task Force Reports (also
called Triangle Papers) per year. Although its meetings are invitation-only,
its membership list is publicly available and can be obtained by contacting
them at: 345 East 46th Street, Suite 711, New York, NY 10017.
Authors Sutton and Wood comment about the seemingly innocent objectives of
the Trilateral Commission. Quoting from the objectives which appear in every
issue of Trialogue, they wrote,
"The Trilateral Commission was formed in
1973 by private citizens of Western Europe, Japan and North America to
foster closer cooperation among these three regions on common problems.
It seeks to improve public understanding of such problems, to support
proposals for handling them jointly, and to nurture habits and practices
of working together among these regions."
Sutton and Wood then explain that the rest of
their book is devoted to telling the truth about the commission.
Referring to the Task Force Report entitled, The Crisis of Democracy written
in part by Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, author Marrs
noted,
"The paper suggested that leaders with
'expertise, seniority, experience and special talents' were needed to
'override the claims of democracy.'"
He added,
"Three years after his paper was published,
Huntington was named coordinator of the 1979 presidential order creating
the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], a civilian organization
with the power to take totalitarian control of government functions in
the event of a national 'emergency.'"
Like the Council on Foreign Relations, the
Trilateral Commission has infiltrated the executive branch of the United
States government.
Regarding the beginning of this pattern of
infiltration into the White House, Sutton and Wood commented,
"On 7 January 1977 Time magazine, whose
editor-in-chief, Hedley Donovan, is a powerful Trilateral Commissioner,
named President Carter 'Man of the year.'"
They added,
"Carter had already chosen his cabinet.
Three of his cabinet members - Vance, Blumenthal, and Brown - were
Trilateral Commissioners... In addition, Carter had appointed another
fourteen Trilateral Commissioners to top government posts... These
presidential appointees represented almost one-third of the Trilateral
Commission members from the United States. Try to give odds to that!"
The January 16, 1977 issue of The Washington
Post expressed,
"Trilateralists are not three-sided people.
They are members of a private, though not secret, international
organization put together by the wealthy banker, David Rockefeller, to
stimulate the establishment dialog between Western Europe, Japan and the
United States. But here is the unsettling thing about the Trilateral
Commission.
The President-elect [Carter] is a member. So
is the Vice-President-elect Walter F. Mondale. So are the new
Secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury. So is Zbigniew Brzezinski,
who is a former Trilateral Director and Carter's National Security
Adviser, also a bunch of others who will make foreign policy for America
in the next four years."
The same issue of The Washington Post reported
that,
"At last count, 13 Trilateralists had gone
into top positions in the administration, not to mention six other
Trilateralists who are established as policy advisers, some of whom may
also get jobs. This is extraordinary when you consider that the
Trilateral Commission only has about 65 American members."
Author Perloff wrote,
"The new President [Carter] appointed more
than seventy men from the CFR, and over twenty members of the much
smaller Trilateral Commission.
Zbigniew Brzezinski acknowledges in his
White House Memoirs:
'Moreover, all the key foreign policy
decision makers of the Carter Administration had previously served
in the Trilateral Commission...'
"Brzezinski," stated Perloff, "of course,
became National Security Adviser, the same position Kissinger had held."
Commenting on a June 18, 1974 article in the New
York Times, which stated,
"the lives and fortunes of large numbers of
human beings hang upon the outcome of decisions taken by a small handful
of national leaders-on the Trilateral Commission," Gary Allen warned
that "it was time to pay more attention - a lot more attention - to the
group."
Regarding the consolidation process of the New
World Order, Sutton and Wood commented,
"In September 1974 Brzezinski was asked in
an interview by the Brazilian newspaper Vega, 'How would you define this
new world order?'"
Brzezinski answered,
"We need to change the international system
for a global system in which new, active and creative forces - recently
developed - should be integrated. This system needs to include Japan,
Brazil, the oil producing countries, and even the USSR..."
When asked if Congress would have an expanded or
diminished role in the new system, Brzezinski declared,
"The reality of our times is that a modern
society such as the U.S. needs a central coordinating and renovating
organ which cannot be made up of six hundred people."
This man is telling you that this New World
Order will be a consolidation of individual countries into a single world
government, which will be controlled by a small clique of insiders, who
believe they are fit to rule the planet. Anytime you have a consolidation of
the power such as this, you have a dictatorship.
Quoting from Brzezinski's book, Between Two Ages, Sutton and Wood wrote that
Brzezinski described Marxism as,
"a further vital and creative stage in the
maturing of man's universal vision... Tension is unavoidable as man
strives to assimilate the new into the framework of the old. But at some
point the old framework becomes overloaded."
Brzezinski continued,
"The new input can no longer be redefined
into traditional forms, and eventually it asserts itself with compelling
force. Today, though the old framework of international politics - with
... the fiction of sovereignty ... is clearly no longer compatible with
reality."
According to Sutton and Wood, when Brzezinski
uses the word "framework" he apparently means the U.S. Constitution; if this
is so, then what he told us in 1971 is that the Trilateral Commission plans
to make drastic changes to the U.S. Constitution.
"One of the most important 'frameworks' in
the world ... is the United States Constitution," exclaimed Sutton and
Wood.
So why is it so important to these elite
organizations that the Constitution be changed?
Well, they've admitted in their own publications that they tend to merge the
U.S. and other NATO countries into a single world government controlled by
the big corporations. Would a constitution which guarantees individual
freedom interfere with their plan? Before the amendments made by the U.S.
Patriot Act, and other anti-terror legislation, the constitution made it
impossible for a totalitarian regime to flourish in the United States.
Sutton and Wood wrote that the Trilaterals wanted to assemble,
"a national constitutional convention to
re-examine the nation's formal institutional framework," in order to
open up "a national dialog on the relevance of existing arrangements...
The needed change," said the Trilaterals "is more likely to develop
incrementally and less overtly."
Brzezinski himself declared,
"International banks and multinational
corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of
the political concepts of the nation-state."
Changing "existing arrangements" can be safely
translated to existing freedoms, such the Bill of Rights.
And "less overtly" means they'll be making these
changes without your approval using deception.
Sutton and Wood commented,
"When Brzezinski refers to "develop(ing)
incrementally and less overtly" he is specifically recommending a
deceptive... approach to abandonment of the Constitution."
After the current "framework" is removed, it
will apparently be replaced with a world constitution furnished by the UN,
which doesn't guarantee personal freedom as a human right, but makes it a
privilege, which is granted if possible.
When multinational corporations and banks run the planet, this is basically
global fascism. Whether it's called fascism, or communism, or socialism,
it's all the same, which is control by those in charge of the state, or
super-state, in the case of the New World Order.
Again Sutton and Wood warn,
"Those ideals which led to the heinous
abuses of Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, and Mussolini are now being accepted as
necessary inevitabilities by our elected and appointed leaders."
"Fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a
merger of state and corporate power."
-Benito Mussolini
In his bestselling book, With No Apologies,
Senator Barry Goldwater described the true intentions of the Trilateral
Commission as,
"a skillful, coordinated effort to seize
control and consolidate the four centers of power-political, monetary,
intellectual, and ecclesiastical [religious]."
He added,
"All this is to be done in the interest of
creating a more peaceful, more productive world."
In other words by using a big lie.
The Task Force report put out by the TC entitled, The Crisis of Democracy
stated,
"The democratic political system no longer
has any purpose. The concepts of equality and individualism give
problems to authority. The media is not sufficiently subservient to the
elite. Democracy has to be "balanced" (i.e., restricted). The authority
and power of the central government must be increased."
These people are telling you that they're going
to restrict your individual rights and centralize power into corporate
hands.
There can be no confusion over the objectives of
this group that has infiltrated the executive branch since the 1970s. They
are telling you in their own publications exactly what they intend to do.
They are setting up a worldwide fascist
dictatorship!
"Trilateralism is the current operational
vehicle for a corporate socialist takeover," advised Sutton and Wood.
Likewise, Senator Goldwater calls the Trilateral
Commission an "international cabal," which,
"is intended to be the vehicle for
multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by
seizing control of the political government of the United States."
This covert takeover has been done, not by a
civil war but by infiltration.
On July 23, 1976, the Greek newspaper Exormisis recognized this overthrow
when they wrote,
"A new kind of fascism emerges with Carter.
The oppression will not have the form we used to know, but it will be
the 'depoliticization' of all citizens in the U.S., and the generating
of all power in the executive branch, that is, the Presidency, without
the President giving any account to the Congress or anybody else except
the multinationals [Banks/Corporations], which have financed Carter's
campaign... The accession to power of Carter ... would mean a new era of
dictatorial policies."

Trilateral Commission chose fellow Trilaterals Zbigniew Brzezinski (center)
for National Security Advisor, and Cyrus Vance for Secretary of State.(*)
"Like sheep going to slaughter, our people
cannot smell the death that awaits them," warned Sutton and Wood. "If we
are about to be thrown into the pits of the dark ages, the most logical
catalyst, or motivator on the horizon is the TRILATERAL COMMISSION."
Summary
The Trilateral Commission presents itself as a humanitarian group, which
seeks to promote world peace through understanding and cooperation.
However, its publications indicate that it plans
to install a worldwide dictatorship, which will be dominated by the
multinational corporations. This is being accomplished using deception.
