# China and Russia Are Ruthlessly Cutting The Legs Out From Under The U.S. 
Dollar

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalbanking265.htm

The
mainstream media in the United States is
almost totally ignoring one of the most important trends in global
economics.
This trend is going to cause the value of
the U.S. dollar to fall dramatically and it is going to cause the cost
of living in the United States to go way up. Right now, the U.S. dollar
is the primary reserve currency of the world.
Even though that status has been chipped
away at in recent years, U.S. dollars still make up
more than 60 percent of all foreign currency reserves in the world.
Most international trade (including the
buying and selling of oil) is conducted in U.S. dollars, and this gives
the United States a tremendous economic advantage. Since so much trade
is done in dollars, there is a constant demand for more dollars all over
the globe from countries that need them for trading purposes.
So the Federal Reserve is able to flood our
financial system with dollars without it causing a tremendous amount of
inflation because the rest of the world ends up soaking up a lot of
those dollars. But now that is changing. China and Russia have been
spearheading a movement to shift away from using the U.S. dollar in
international trade.
At the moment, the shift is happening
gradually, but at some point a tipping point will come (for example if
Saudi Arabia were to declare that it will no longer take U.S. dollars
for oil) and the entire global financial system is going to change. When
that tipping point comes the global demand for U.S. dollars is going to
absolutely plummet and nightmarish inflation will come to the United
States.
If such a scenario sounds far out to you,
then you have not been paying attention. In fact, China and Russia have
been working very hard to move us toward exactly such a scenario.
China and Russia are not the "buddies"
of the United States. The truth is that they are both ruthless
competitors of the United States and leaders from both nations have been
calling for a new global currency
for years.
They don't like that the United States has a
built-in advantage of having the reserve currency of the world, and over
the past several years both countries have been busy making
international agreements that seek to chip away at that advantage.
Just the other day, China and Germany agreed
to start conducting an increasing amount of trade with each other in
their own currencies.
You would think that a major currency
agreement between the 2nd and 4th largest
economies on the face of the planet would make headlines all over the
United States.
Instead, the silence in the U.S. media was
deafening.
At least there were some reports in the
international media about this. The following is from
a Reuters article about this very important deal....
Germany
and China plan to conduct an increasing amount of their trade in
Euros and Yuan, the two nations said in a joint statement after
talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao in Beijing on Thursday.
"Both
sides intend to support financial institutions and companies of both
countries in the use of the Renminbi and euro in bilateral trade and
investments," said the text of the statement.
By itself, this deal would not be that
alarming.
However, the truth is that both Russia and
China have been making deals like this all over the globe in recent
years. I detailed 11 more major agreements like the one that China and
Germany just made in this article: "11
International Agreements That Are Nails In The Coffin Of The Petrodollar".
In that article I listed a few of the things
that will likely happen when the petrodollar dies...
-
Oil will cost a lot more.
-
Everything will cost a lot more.
-
There will be a lot less foreign
demand for U.S. government debt.
-
Interest rates on U.S. government
debt will rise.
-
Interest rates on just about
everything in the U.S. economy will rise.
So enjoy going to "the dollar store" while
you can.
It will turn into the "five and ten dollar
store" soon enough.
Okay, so if you are China and Russia and you
are working hard to undermine the dollar, how do you get prepared for
the fiat currency crisis that your hard work will eventually create?
You guessed it. You hoard gold and other
precious metals. And that is exactly what China and Russia has been
doing.
A recent
MarketWatch article detailed the massive hoarding of gold that
Russia has been doing...
I cant
imagine it means anything cheerful that Vladimir Putin, the Russian
czar, is stockpiling gold as fast as he can get his hands on it.
According
to the World Gold Council, Russia has more than doubled its gold
reserves in the past five years.
Putin has
taken advantage of the financial crisis to build the worlds
fifth-biggest gold pile in a handful of years, and is buying about
half a billion dollars worth every month.
Of course Russia is not alone in hoarding
gold.
According
to
Zero Hedge, China has quietly been importing gigantic mountains
of gold...
In
July, Chinese gold imports from HK, after two months of declines,
have picked up once more and hit a 3-month high of 75.8 tons.
While
it is notable that this number is double the 38.1 tons imported a
year prior, and that year-to-date imports are now a record 458.6
tons, well over four times greater than the seven month total in
2011 which was 103.9 tons.
What
is far more important is that in the first seven months of 2012
alone China has imported nearly as much gold as the total holdings
of the hedge fund at the heart of the Eurozone, elsewhere known
simply as the European Central Bank, and just as importantly
considering the import run-rate has hardly slowed down in August,
which data we will have in a few weeks,
it is now safe to
say that in 2012 alone China has imported more gold than the ECB's
entire official 502.1 tons of holdings.
And all over the world Chinese companies are
buying up gold producers.
China National Gold Group Corporation has
put in a
$3.9 billion bid to buy African Barrick Gold PLC, but that is only
one example.
A recent
Fox Business article listed a bunch of other similar transactions
that have taken place recently....
Zijin
Mining Group Co. (2899.HK), China's second-largest gold producer by
output, said last week that its subsidiary has acquired more than
50% of Kalgoorlie's Norton Gold Fields (NGF.AU).
That deal
gives it a foothold in the Australian market, the world's
second-largest source of gold output after China itself. In 2011,
Zijin bought 60% of Kazakhstan-based miner Altynken, which has
access to a gold mine in Kyrgyzstan.
Since
2008, Chinese companies have completed 10 US$20-million-plus
acquisitions of Australian gold assets, worth a combined $1.6
billion, according to Dealogic. Half were initiated since last year.
In
November, Shandong Gold-Mining Co. (600547.SH) launched a bid to
acquire Brazilian gold miner Jaguar Mining Inc. (JAG.T) for $1
billion.
You would have to be blind to not see what
is happening.
Other big names have been hoarding gold as
well. In a
previous article I detailed how George Soros, John Paulson and
central banks all over the planet have been hungrily accumulating gold.
So what does all of this mean for the price
of gold?
That's right - it is likely to keep heading
up. In fact, Citi analyst Tom Fitzpatrick believes that the price
of gold
will likely hit $2500 within 6 months.
Personally, I believe that there will be
times when precious metals both fall and rise in price dramatically. It
is going to be a wild ride. But in the long-term I
believe that all precious metals will be going up as fiat currencies
such as the U.S. dollar fail. Sadly, most Americans have no idea just
how incredibly vulnerable the U.S. dollar really is.
The following is an excerpt from a recent
piece
by investigative journalist Bob Woodward.
It shows just how worried our leaders are
about a crash of U.S. Treasuries....
Another
possible outcome, Geithner said, was perhaps worse. Suppose we have
an auction and no one shows up?
The
cascading impact would be unknowable.
The world
could decide to dump U.S. Treasuries. Prices would plummet, interest
rates would skyrocket. The one pillar of stability, the United
States, the rock in the global economy, could collapse.
What happens someday if the rest of the
world decides to reject our currency and our debt?
Right now we are able to trade our dollars
for the things that we "need" such as oil from the Middle East and cheap
plastic consumer products from China.
But what happens if the Federal Reserve
keeps printing and printing and printing and the rest of the world
eventually decides that the U.S. dollar is not even worth the paper it
is printed on?
The truth is that the amount of printing
the Federal Reserve has been doing and the amount of
borrowing the federal government has been doing are both completely and
totally unsustainable.
At this point, Moody's is threatening to cut
the credit rating of the federal government if a deal is not reached
soon to reduce our debt to GDP ratio. And Moody's is not the only one
concerned about
our exploding debt.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble
recently stated that he believes that,
"there is great uncertainty about the
course American politics will take in dealing the U.S. government's
debts, which are much too high".
Just because the economy is relatively
stable right now does not mean that it is always going to be that way.
If we keep debasing our currency like this,
at some point the rest of the world is going to decide that China and
Russia have been right all along and that we need
a new global reserve
currency.
That day is coming. It might not come
tomorrow or next week or next month but it is definitely coming.
Once the U.S. dollar loses reserve currency
status, that will be a major turning point in the history of our
country. We will never fully recover from that, and we will never get
back to the same level of prosperity that we are enjoying today.
So enjoy spending those dollars while you
can.
The party is almost over...
