On December 25 US authorities arrested a Nigerian named Abdulmutallab
aboard a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on charges of
having tried to blow up the plane with smuggled explosives.
Since then reports have been broadcast from CNN,
the New York Times and other sources that he was "suspected" of having been
trained in Yemen for his terror mission. What the world has been subjected
to since is the emergence of a new target for the US War on Terror,
namely a desolate state on the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen.
A closer look at the background suggests the
Pentagon and US intelligence have a hidden agenda in Yemen.
For some months the world has seen a steady escalation of US military
involvement in Yemen, a dismally poor land adjacent to Saudi Arabia on its
north, the Red Sea on its west, the Gulf of Aden on its south, opening to
the Arabian Sea, overlooking another desolate land that has been in the
headlines of late, Somalia.
The evidence suggests that the Pentagon and US
intelligence are moving to militarize a strategic chokepoint for the worlds
oil flows, Bab el-Mandab, and using the Somalia piracy incident, together
with claims of a new Al Qaeda threat arising from Yemen, to
militarize one of the worlds most important oil transport routes.
In addition, undeveloped petroleum reserves in
the territory between Yemen and Saudi Arabia are reportedly among the
worlds largest.
The 23-year-old Nigerian man charged with the
failed bomb attempt, Abdulmutallab, reportedly has been talking,
claiming he was sent on his mission by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
(AQAP), based in Yemen.
This has conveniently turned the worlds
attention on Yemen as a new center of the alleged Al Qaeda terror
organization.
Notably, Bruce Riedel, a 30-year CIA veteran who advised President
Obama on the policy leading to the Afghan troop surge, wrote in his blog of
the alleged ties of the Detroit bomber to Yemen,
"The attempt to destroy Northwest Airlines
Flight 253 en route from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day
underscores the growing ambition of Al Qaeda's Yemen franchise, which
has grown from a largely Yemeni agenda to become a player in the global
Islamic jihad in the last year...
The weak Yemeni government of President Ali
Abdallah Salih, which has never fully controlled the country and now
faces a host of growing problems, will need significant American support
to defeat AQAP." [1]
Some basic Yemen
geopolitics
Before we can say much about the latest incident, it is useful to look more
closely at the Yemen situation. Here several things stand out as peculiar
when stacked against Washingtons claims about a resurgent Al Qaeda
organization in the Arabian Peninsula.
In early 2009 the chess pieces on the Yemeni board began to move. Tariq
al-Fadhli, a former jihadist leader originally from South Yemen, broke a
15 year alliance with the Yemeni government of President Ali Abdullah
Saleh and announced he was joining the broad-based opposition coalition
known as the Southern Movement (SM).
Al-Fadhli had been a member of the Mujahideen
movement in Afghanistan in the late 1980s. His break with the government
was reported in Arab and Yemeni media in April 2009. Al-Fadhlis break with
the Yemen dictatorship gave new power to the Southern Movement (SM).
He has since become a leading figure in the
alliance.
Yemen itself is a synthetic amalgam created
after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, when the southern
Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) lost its main foreign
sponsor.
Unification of the northern Yemen Arab Republic
and the southern PDRY state led to a short-lived optimism that ended in a
brief civil war in 1994, as southern army factions organized a revolt
against what they saw as the corrupt crony state rule of northern President
Ali Abdullah Saleh.
President Saleh has held a one-man rule since
1978, first as President of North Yemen (the Yemen Arab Republic) and since
1990 as President of the unified new Yemen. The southern army revolt failed
as Saleh enlisted al-Fadhli and other Yemeni Salafists, followers of a
conservative interpretation of Islam, and jihadists to fight the formerly
Marxist forces of the Yemen Socialist Party in the south.
Before 1990, Washington and the Saudi Kingdom backed and supported Saleh and
his policy of Islamization as a bid to contain the communist south.[2]
Since then Saleh has relied on a strong
Salafist-jihadi movement to retain a one-man dictatorial rule. The break
with Saleh by al-Fadhli and his joining the southern opposition group with
his former socialist foes marked a major setback for Saleh.
Soon after al-Fadhli joined the Southern Movement coalition, on April 28,
2009 protests in the southern Yemeni provinces of Lahj, Dalea and Hadramout
intensified. There were demonstrations by tens of thousands of dismissed
military personnel and civil servants demanding better pay and benefits,
demonstrations that had been taking place in growing numbers since 2006.
The April demonstrations included for the first
time a public appearance by al-Fadhli. His appearance served to change a
long moribund southern socialist movement into a broader nationalist
campaign. It also galvanized President Saleh, who then called on Saudi
Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council states for help, warning
that the entire Arabian Peninsula would suffer the consequences.
Complicating the picture in what some call a failed state, in the north
Saleh faces an al-Houthi Zaydi Shiite rebellion.
On September 11, 2009, in an Al-Jazeera TV
interview, Saleh accused Iraqs Shiite opposition leader, Muqtada al-Sadr,
and also Iran, of backing the north Yemen Shiite Houthist rebels in an Al-Jazeera
TV interview.
Yemens Saleh declared,
"We cannot accuse the Iranian official side,
but the Iranians are contacting us, saying that they are prepared for a
mediation. This means that the Iranians have contacts with them [the
Houthists], given that they want to mediate between the Yemeni
government and them. Also, Muqtada al-Sadr in al-Najaf in Iraq is asking
that he be accepted as a mediator. This means they have a link."
[3]
Yemen authorities claim they have seized caches
of weapons made in Iran, while the Houthists claim to have captured Yemeni
equipment with Saudi Arabian markings, accusing Sanaa (the capital of Yemen
and site of the US Embassy) of acting as a Saudi proxy.
Iran has rejected claims that Iranian weapons
were found in north Yemen, calling claims of support to the rebels as
baseless. [4]
What about Al Qaeda?
The picture that emerges is one of a desperate US-backed dictator, Yemens
President Saleh, increasingly losing control after two decades as despotic
ruler of the unified Yemen.
Economic conditions in the country took a
drastic downward slide in 2008 when world oil prices collapsed. Some 70% of
the state revenues derive from Yemens oil sales. The central government of
Saleh sits in former North Yemen in Sanaa, while the oil is in former South
Yemen.
Yet Saleh controls the oil revenue flows. Lack
of oil revenue has made Salehs usual option of buying off opposition groups
all but impossible.
Into this chaotic domestic picture comes the January 2009 announcement,
prominently featured in select Internet websites, that Al Qaeda, the alleged
global terrorist organization created by the late CIA-trained Saudi, Osama
bin Laden, has opened a major new branch in Yemen for both Yemen and Saudi
operations.
Al Qaeda in Yemen released a statement through online jihadist forums Jan.
20, 2009 from the groups leader Nasir al-Wahayshi, announcing formation of
a single al Qaeda group for the Arabian Peninsula under his command.
According to al-Wahayshi, the new group, al
Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, would consist of his former Al Qaeda in
Yemen, as well as members of the defunct Saudi Al Qaeda group.
The press release claimed, interestingly enough,
that a Saudi national, a former Guantanamo detainee (Number 372), Abu-Sayyaf
al-Shihri, would serve as al-Wahayshis deputy.
Days later an online video from al-Wahayshi appeared under the alarming
title, "We Start from Here and We Will Meet at al-Aqsa." Al-Aqsa refers to
the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem that Jews know as Temple Mount, the
site of the destroyed Temple of Solomon, which Muslims call Al Haram
Al Sharif.
The video threatens Muslim leaders - including
Yemenis President Saleh, the Saudi royal family, and Egyptian President
Mubarak - and promises to take the jihad from Yemen to Israel to "liberate"
Muslim holy sites and Gaza, something that would likely detonate World War
III if anyone were mad enough to do it.
Also in that video, in addition to former Guantanamo inmate al-Shihri, is a
statement from Abu-al-Harith Muhammad al-Awfi, identified as a field
commander in the video, and allegedly former Guantanamo detainee 333.
As it is well-established that torture methods
are worthless to obtain truthful confessions, some have speculated that the
real goal of CIA and Pentagon interrogators at Guantanamo prison since
September 2001, has been to use brutal techniques to train or recruit
sleeper terrorists who can be activated on command by US intelligence, a
charge difficult to prove or disprove.
The presence of two such high-ranking Guantanamo
graduates in the new Yemen-based Al Qaeda is certainly ground for
questioning.
Al Qaeda in Yemen is apparently anathema to al-Fadhli and the enlarged
mass-based Southern Movement. In an interview, al-Fadhli declared,
"I have strong relations with all of the
jihadists in the north and the south and everywhere, but not with
al-Qaeda."[5]
That has not hindered Saleh from claiming the
Southern Movement and al Qaeda are one and the same, a convenient way to
insure backing from Washington.
According to US intelligence reports, there are a grand total of perhaps 200
Al Qaeda members in southern Yemen. [6]
Al-Fadhli gave an interview distancing himself from al Qaeda in May 2009,
declaring,
"We [in South Yemen] have been invaded 15
years ago and we are under a vicious occupation. So we are busy with our
cause and we do not look at any other cause in the world. We want our
independence and to put an end to this occupation."[7]
Conveniently, the same day, Al Qaeda made a
large profile declaring its support for southern Yemens cause.
On May 14, in an audiotape released on the internet, al-Wahayshi, leader of
al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, expressed sympathy with the people of the
southern provinces and their attempt to defend themselves against their
"oppression," declaring,
"What is happening in Lahaj, Dhali, Abyan
and Hadramaut and the other southern provinces cannot be approved. We
have to support and help [the southerners]."
He promised retaliation:
"The oppression against you will not pass
without punishment... the killing of Muslims in the streets is an
unjustified major crime." [8]
The curious emergence of a tiny but
well-publicized al Qaeda in southern Yemen amid what observers call a
broad-based popular-based Southern Movement front that eschews the radical
global agenda of al Qaeda, serves to give the Pentagon a kind of casus belli
to escalate US military operations in the strategic region.
Indeed, after declaring that the Yemen internal strife was Yemens own
affair, President
Obama ordered air strikes in Yemen.
The Pentagon claimed its attacks on December 17
and 24 killed three key al Qaeda leaders but no evidence has yet proven
this. Now the Christmas Day Detroit bomber drama gives new life to
Washingtons "War
on Terror" campaign in Yemen.
Obama has now offered military assistance to the
Saleh Yemen government.
Somali Pirates
escalate as if on cue
As if on cue, at the same time CNN headlines broadcast new terror threats
from Yemen, the long-running Somalia pirate attacks on commercial shipping
in the same Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea across from southern Yemen
escalated dramatically after having been reduced by multinational ship
patrols.
On December 29, Moscows RAI Novosti reported that Somali pirates seized a
Greek cargo vessel in the Gulf of Aden off Somalia's coast. Earlier the same
day a British-flagged chemical tanker and its 26 crew were also seized in
the Gulf of Aden.
In a sign of sophisticated skills in using
western media, pirate commander Mohamed Shakir told the British
newspaper The Times by phone,
"We have hijacked a ship with [a] British
flag in the Gulf of Aden late yesterday."
The US intelligence brief, Stratfor, reports
that The Times, owned by neo-conservative financial backer, Rupert
Murdoch, is sometimes used by Israeli intelligence to plant useful
stories.
The two latest events brought a record number of attacks and hijackings for
2009.
As of December 22, attacks by Somali pirates in
the Gulf of Aden and the east coast of Somalia numbered 174, with 35 vessels
hijacked and 587 crew taken hostage so far in 2009, almost all successful
pirate activity, according to the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy
Reporting Center.
The open question is, who is providing the
Somali "pirates" with arms and logistics sufficient to elude international
patrols from numerous nations?
Notably, on January 3, President Saleh got a phone call from Somali
president Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed in which he briefed president
Saleh on latest developments in Somalia.
Sheikh Sharif, whose own base in Mogadishu is so
weak he is sometimes referred to as President of Mogadishu Airport,
told Saleh he would share information with Saleh about any terror activities
that might be launched from Somali territories targeting stability and
security of Yemen and the region.
The Oil chokepoint and
other oily affairs
The strategic significance of the region between Yemen and Somalia becomes
the point of geopolitical interest. It is the site of Bab el-Mandab, one of
what the US Government lists as seven strategic world oil shipping
chokepoints.
The US Government Energy Information Agency
states that,
"closure of the Bab el-Mandab could keep
tankers from the Persian Gulf from reaching the Suez Canal/Sumed
pipeline complex, diverting them around the southern tip of Africa. The
Strait of Bab el-Mandab is a chokepoint between the horn of Africa and
the Middle East, and a strategic link between the Mediterranean Sea and
Indian Ocean." [9]
Bab el-Mandab, between Yemen, Djibouti, and
Eritrea connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea.
Oil and other exports from the Persian Gulf must
pass through Bab el-Mandab before entering the Suez Canal. In 2006, the
Energy Department in Washington reported that an estimated 3.3 million
barrels a day of oil flowed through this narrow waterway to Europe, the
United States, and Asia.
Most oil, or some 2.1 million barrels a day,
goes north through the Bab el-Mandab to the Suez/Sumed complex into the
Mediterranean.
An excuse for a US or NATO militarization of the
waters around Bab el-Mandab would give Washington another major link in its
pursuit of control of the seven most critical oil chokepoints around the
world, a major part of any future US strategy aimed at denying oil flows to
China, the EU or any region or country that opposes US policy.
Given that significant flows of Saudi oil pass
through Bab el-Mandab, a US military control there would serve to deter the
Saudi Kingdom from becoming serious about transacting future oil sales with
China or others no longer in dollars, as was recently reported by UK
Independent journalist Robert Fisk.
It would also be in a position to threaten Chinas oil transport from Port
Sudan on the Red Sea just north of Bab el-Mandab, a major lifeline in
Chinas national energy needs.
In addition to its geopolitical position as a major global oil transit
chokepoint, Yemen is reported to
hold some of the worlds greatest untapped oil
reserves. Yemens Masila Basin and Shabwa Basin are
reported by international oil companies to contain "world class
discoveries."[10]
Frances Total and several smaller international
oil companies are engaged in developing Yemens oil production.
Some fifteen years ago I was told in a private
meeting with a well-informed Washington insider that Yemen contained "enough
undeveloped oil to fill the oil demand of the entire world for the next
fifty years."
Perhaps there is more to Washingtons recent
Yemen concern than a rag-tag al Qaeda whose very existence as a global
terror organization has been doubted by seasoned Islamic experts.
