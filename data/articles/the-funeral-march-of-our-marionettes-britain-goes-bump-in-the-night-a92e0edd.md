People are not necessarily marionettes, but most
among our leading politicians and so-called economists, most of the time,
seem to be just that about now. The case of what is thought of as the
present Ireland crisis of the British imperial
Inter-Alpha Group, appears
to be just that at the present moment.
While only silly people actually believe in statistical economic
forecasting, and they are clearly in the majority currently, in reality,
there is systemic difference between competent economic forecasting, of
which most of the worlds economists are presently ignorant, and so-called
statistical forecasting.
Whereas, as I have demonstrated successfully,
repeatedly, in my own case, that the causes, probable form of, and
approximate timing of an oncoming threat of a crisis can be foreseen, the
way in which a probable economic, or related crisis in a nation, or among
nations will unfold, or might be averted, is understandable, but, in
principle, is not predictable in a statistical-mechanical way.
The very
essence of the distinction of the human species from the beasts, is the
voluntary factor uniquely specific to the creator, or to mankind.
A general economic crisis within a group of nations, or of some region of
the world, may be expressed in one or more of a variety of forms. What is
certain, is the fact that potential for such a crisis has assumed a systemic
form; however, even then, the choice of which among several forms might be
chosen, remains an open question within a narrowing range of options as a
critical point in that process is being approached.
Take two cases of leading significance for the cases immediate at hand now:
Currently, the trans-Atlantic economy has been dominated, increasingly, in a
manner as since the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.
The
foolish choice of the unnecessary U.S. engagement in a needless, decade-long
war in Indo-China, which was the undoing of the United States, is a leading
choice for an illustrative case in point.
The effects of that war led into
the British orchestration, under Prime Minister Harold Wilson, of the U.S.
crisis of February-March of 1968, and the social explosion of the 68ers
leading into the election of the U.S. Nixon Administration and the
British-directed virtual simultaneity of the mid-August 1971 wrecking.
A
wrecking, by that administration, of the stabilizing role of what had been
the fixed-exchange-rate system, by the virtually simultaneous launching of
the new world monetary system, the British empire-launched Inter-Alpha
Group.
That change which occurred during 1968-71, combined with the effect of the
Anglo-Dutch-Saudi petroleum hoax, led into the almost fatally ruinous U.S.
Carter Administration, and, thence, to the catastrophic intersection of what
I had forecast as the echo of the
1929 Stock Market Crash.
This was
combined with what was to prove itself to have been the wrecking of the U.S.
economy in favor of the hyper-inflationary potential of the policies under
Federal Reserve Chairman (and de facto
British empire asset) Alan Greenspan.
Greenspans long and ruinous reign overlapped, functionally, the 1989-1990
launching of the ruin of European economy through the effects of the
launching of what was to become the presently awful crash of the Euro system
through the joint actions of Englands Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
Frances President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, and U.S. President
George H.W. Bush.
That action, identified with the Maastricht agreements, has become the
keystone of the presently onrushing disintegration of Europe, including the
United Kingdom, in progress now.
For the purpose of achieving a competent understanding of the presently
onrushing breakdown-crisis of the present world monetarist system, it must
be emphasized, that there were crucial steps along the pathway from the
death of U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt through the present time,
occasions at which voluntary avoidance of each step of this crisis were
within the power of discretion of the United States, and each combination of
leading powers of the world at large.
Essentially, such options are
implicitly within the powers of the will of leading governments of the
world, as now.
The voluntary quality of the distinction of man from all beasts, lies in the
existence of options for changing the system which is the current carrier of
what had seemed, retrospectively, to have been a predictably inevitable
crisis.
The principal, and most frequent cause of all major crises of
civilization, has been the refusal of relevant powers to recognize, and to
eliminate the existing system which had maintained the policy-structure
under which the conditions for an existential quality of crisis had been
engendered.
The British system, with its perennially imperial influence on the leading
combination among the money-systems of the planet, has been, since the
accession of William of Orange and, then, since the death of Queen Anne, the
consistent, either direct, or contingent cause of all of the major economic
crises of the planet since the onset of the 1492-1648 launching of a
virtually permanent state of successive waves of mass-murderous warfare
within, and reaching beyond the European system.
The most notable of the
launching-pads for the reign of warfare centered upon the
British East India
Company and its outgrowths, has been what is called the Liberal system, the
system which bans actual truth in favor of the degraded system based on
pleasure and pain, the Liberal system rooted in the designs of Venices
Paolo Sarpi.
There lies the blame for the great, and accelerated rates of suffering
throughout the world presently, especially, for the present moment, in the
trans-Atlantic, near-Asia, and African sections of the planet.
Admittedly,
Asia contains some terrible poverty, but, excepting for the effects of the
collapse of the trans-Atlantic region, the threat to nations such as China
and India is located in the threat of the presently rather immediate,
post-August 2007 crash of the Trans-Atlantic world.
Thus, it is fair, and very useful to say, that the present world crisiss
roots are to be located in the trans-Atlantic system. The specific cause for
this pattern of accelerating ruin of the trans-Atlantic world lies within
the related influence of the British imperial system currently associated,
since August 1971, in the superseding, then, of the fixed-exchange-rate
system by the British imperial Inter-Alpha System.
The de facto bankruptcy
of that latter system, defines the immediate cause for the presently
onrushing and accelerating rate of collapse of the planet as a whole. The
removal of that bankrupt system of great monetarist fraud, is the certain
target which must be now removed from the worlds systems of economy and
international trade.
Even the survival of the British economy now depends upon a sudden and
ruthless debriding of the world economy from the rotting remains of that
monstrously bankrupt Inter-Alpha System and its Wall Street appendages.
A
return to an emergency mode of establishing a combination of a virtual
Glass-Steagall law and an associated emergency approach to a fixed
exchange-rate system of sovereign national currencies, is the absolute
precondition for preventing, now, an accelerating plunge into a planetary
new dark age which would be, most probably, of several generations.
There have been elements in British policy-shaping, which have relished the
prospect of destroying the United States through inducing a mentally ill,
Emperor Nero-like, U.S. President
Obama, to block a re-enactment of Glass
Steagall.
Ironically, that very blocking would ensure the doom of the United
Kingdom: British leading opinion is often not actual British interest.
What Will The British Do?
There are options for the British economy, on condition that it severs
itself from the Inter-Alpha System as a system, while turning to a
protectionist system which would nest the British economy within a
protectionist form of global fixed-exchange-rate system. Time to get back to
a certain starting-point!
At that point, the British economys revival and continued survival will
depend on some relatively painful, but nonetheless salutary adjustments.
The
most basic change in design under a fixed-exchange-rate reform, would be the
adoption of an economic platform of basic economic infrastructure of the
type which I have illustrated by the general, continental case of the
implementation of a
NAWAPA system for North America as combined, in an
integral fashion, with a vigorous program of both nuclear and thermonuclear
power development, and both high-speed, heavy-duty rail and maglev systems,
and other essential elements of manufacturing and agricultural development
which would be implicitly required sources for support of the NAWAPA
development.
Magnetic levitation transport-systems, rather than push-me,
pull-me rail systems, are most highly recommended, specifically, for heavy
freight delivery into the mountainous ranges which are at the core of a NAWAPA installation.
The increased rainfall patterns which NAWAPA brings to the North American
continent, and for the Russian, U.S.A. and Canadian leading role in
developing the great scientific and other potential of the Arctic, ensure
the revived agricultural productivity and relevant climate-change required
for sustaining even the existing levels of population at acceptable
standards of living.
To realize the types of objectives implied by these exemplary remarks
bearing on a British reform for survival and recovery, Britain, among other
nations, must rediscover the truly competent substitute for the popular, but
incompetent use of the term infrastructure.
This means that the
traditional, geopolitical notion of Britain as seated in a maritime power,
must be recognized as a piece of archaic folly.
It is the increase of
combined increase of physical-capital-intensity and intensity of the
Promethean excellence of rising energy-flux density into new goals for
mankinds place in not only its Solar System, but the galaxy on whose fringe
our Solar System is sustained by the medium of cosmic radiation, which must
be targets of our intentions as a human species.
If such are not the intentions, not only of Britain, but the world at large,
as we see the rise of such backward directions in intentions in certain
large but also smaller but ingenious nations in Asia today, then this planet
would be a damned poor planet on which to live for several generations just
ahead.
Unfortunately, it is the only planet currently available to us, and
that for a considerable amount of time still to come.
