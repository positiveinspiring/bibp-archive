Since 2010,
the United
Nations Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) have
stated that the rise in food prices is directly correlated to the 80
million people being added to the worlds population annually.
This fact, according to the globalists at the
UN, is beginning to,
tax both the skills of farmers and the
limits of the earths land and water resources.
Added to this problem are the 3 million people
who are moving up the food chain eating more than their share in
gluttonous nations like the United States and China.
While New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is
announcing that the city plan to ban sugary beverages larger than 16
ounces to curb the waistlines of the average New Yorker, the rest of the
world is wondering where their next meal may be coming from.
The UK, the average persons
weight continues to dramatically increase with the use of high fructose
corn syrup, increase consumption of processed foods and a lethargic
lifestyle. Their societal issues with food and weight are mirrored in
America. And if compared to other nations, the problem remains the same.
While some die of starvation, others are dying from over consumption. Both
the degenerative quality of the food being sold in the developed world and
the lack of food in the under-developed nations are causational to the same
end - population reduction.
To keep up appearances, the mainstream media
will dole out
ludicrous studies such as one published last month that reported men who
are stressed find heavier women more attractive.
Instead of facing the
health problems brought on by an industry that is designed to deplete the
human body of nutrition thereby causing disease and early death, the MSM
would have the American public considering their burgeoning waistlines as
trendy.
Meanwhile, the quest to become anorexic-esque thin is still en vogue
and sought after - ever leaving the average American confused about their
self-image.
Perhaps a portion of the problem facing
Americans and their eating habits stems from the use of
chemically enhanced food such as chocolate that is prescribed as a
mood-stabilizing drug. The brain manipulation by way of chemical inhibitors
comes from the use of valproic acid that acts as an anti-depressant; calming
moods and other related psychiatric conditions.
Pointing out the US investment in
ethanol is a drain on the worlds food stores; which allocates massive
amounts of food to the production of this plant-based fuel for cars.
The World Bank issued a statement of concern
last month for the coming food shortage due to the drought devastating the
US and Europe.
According to Jim Yong Kim, World Bank group president:
Food prices rose
again sharply threatening the health and well-being of millions of people.
Africa and the Middle East are particularly vulnerable, but so are people in
other countries where the prices of grains have gone up abruptly.
Because of the drought, Obama
offered, through the USDA, to purchase $170 million in pork, chicken,
lamb and catfish to stave off some of the financial burden of American
farmers.
The White House announced the use of this food in food-aid
programs.
Water resources are directly tied to global food
supplies. As more of the planets water is securitized by private
corporations and governments, some globalists suggest that the worlds
population may have to
become vegetarian in order to survive.
Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm
International Water Institute (SIWI) are responsible for a
report that explains,
there will not be enough water available on
current croplands to produce food for the expected 9 billion population in
2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western
nations.
The UN and Oxfam are warning nations that the
scarcity of water will limit food production dramatically and cause another
food crisis. Oxfam is predicting food prices to rise incredibly in developed
nations.
The globalist answer to the problem: by adopting
a global vegetarian diet, the worlds water supplies will be saved and the
erratic weather evidenced by the man-made climate change myth will simply
disappear. Miraculously, third world nations would have the arable land to
feed their populations which would increase trade and food surplus.
In April, S. Matthew Laio, bioethics professor
at New York University
proposed that the masses take a pill that would cause nausea when a
person ate meat. This would eventually create a lasting aversion to
meat-eating.
Laio had other ideas, like using genetic
engineering or hormone therapy to birth smaller babies that would be less
resource-intensive throughout their lifetime. Larger people consume more
food and energy over their life. Smaller people consume less. Liao believes
that human engineering would liberate a family to choose from two medium
sized children or three small sized children. Or they could choose one large
child.
The choice is theirs.
This bioethics professor also thinks very highly
of Chinas one child policy (that was first instituted by Mao, modeled after
Henry Kissingers work) and Britains advocators of a two-child maximum.
Competition for water will be the next Great
War. The International Water Management Institute (IWMI)
claims that food security
in Southeast Asia and the sub-Saharan Africa will be protected by investing
in small pumps because the world depends on their success.
The World Bank and the UN Population Fund have
issued ultimatums (referred to as guidelines) to under-developed nations to
either implement their plans for population reduction, or be withdrawn from
the international community.
According to the UNs
Reproductive Health Action Plan 2010-2015, adherence to the UNs
Millennium Development Goal number 5 is an imperative. This goal calls for a
75% reduction in maternal mortality and universal access to reproductive
health by 2015.
Melinda Gates, at the recent London Family
Planning Summit held in July, spoke of
preventing 40% of unwanted births in under-developed nations like Africa
and India to reduce the worlds human population growth significantly.
Population stabilization, the true
meaning behind family planning is evident in the World Bank and UN
Population Funds push against sovereign nations to reduce their populations
by rule of the global consensus which dictates human rights policy by
deeming some fit to live and others not.
Based on the Rockefeller Commission report,
population stabilization is an endeavor worth pursuing, although its success
would take decades because of the high incidents of reproduction by
marriage. However, with the destruction of the family, this problem could be
solved. Furthermore, the stabilization of the global population would
reallocate resources to be better spent in terms of quality versus quantity.
Concluding that the best way to achieve
population stabilization is to coerce the nations citizens that they freely
choose abortion and not having a child at all as part of an acceptable
societal norm. By way of implementation of social barrier and cultural
pressures, the average citizen would rather go with the flow and chose not
to procreate for the sake of being part of the herd.
Simultaneously, by reforming the acceptable
amount of children born into a married house-hold, the impact on population
growth would seem to be natural. And trends would take care of social
conformity. Those who had more children would be shunned.
Increasing access to abortion clinics with the
inception and popularity of Planned Parenthood would give unacceptable
pregnancies a viable solution. This would distract and control another Baby
Boom from occurring.
Using images on television, film and print media
to control the ideals of the modern family to fit the model of a population
stabilized by no longer being plagued with run-a-way births; but focusing
on the example of small-families as the best way to go.
Last month, eugenicists, Alberto Giubilini and
Francesca Minerva
proposed after-birth abortion for infants up to age 2 as they are a
threat to their parents and society because of the drain on resources,
time and energy expended to care for them.
Giubilini and Minerva continued
on to say that,
merely being human is not in itself a reason for ascribing
someone a right to life. Indeed, many humans are not considered subjects of
a right to life.
Droughts, lack of access to nutritional food and
an agenda of
the global Elite to
reduce the population are not conspiracy
theories.
Simply look at the data, the evidence being played out in real
time and their own publications where these concepts are outlined for
implementation.
They all connect together to form the basis of
the 90% human population reduction that is necessary for the global Elite to
control the worlds population as feudal serfs and slaves to
Global
Governance.
