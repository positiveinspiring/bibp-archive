The fight between
the CIA and the Senate
Intelligence Committee over the
Committee's Torture Report - which Dan
Froomkin
covered here - has now zeroed in on the White House.
-
Did the White House order the CIA to
withdraw 920 documents from a server made available to Committee
staffers, as Senator Dianne Feinstein
says the agency claimed in 2010?
-
Were those documents - perhaps thousands
of them - pulled in deference to a White House claim of executive
privilege, as Senator Mark Udall and then CIA General Counsel
Stephen Preston
suggested last fall?
-
And is the White House continuing to
withhold 9,000 pages of documents without invoking privilege, as
McClatchy
reported yesterday?
We can be sure about one thing:
The
Obama
White House has covered up the
Bush presidency's role in the torture
program for years.
Specifically, from 2009 to 2012, the
administration went to extraordinary lengths to keep a single short
phrase, describing President Bush's authorization of the torture
program, secret.
Some time before October 29, 2009, then National
Security Advisor Jim Jones
filed an ex parte classified declaration with the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York, in response to a FOIA request by the
ACLU seeking documents related to the torture program.
In it, Jones argued that the CIA should not be
forced to disclose the "source of the CIA's authority," as referenced in the
title of a document providing "Guidelines
for Interrogations" and signed by then CIA Director George
Tenet. That document was cited in two Justice Department memos at issue
in the FOIA.
Jones claimed that "source of authority"
constituted an intelligence method that needed to be protected.
The Obama Administration
successfully appealed a judge's ruling
to release the redacted part
of this title describing
under what authorities
torture was conducted.
Document obtained by ACLU
under FOIA.
As other documents and reporting have made
clear, the source of authority was a September 17, 2001 Presidential
declaration authorizing not just detention and interrogation, but a range of
other counterterrorism activities, including targeted killings.
Both former CIA Director
Michael Hayden and former CIA Acting
General Counsel
John Rizzo have made clear that the torture program began as a covert
operation.
"A few days after the [9/11] attacks, President Bush signed a
top-secret directive to CIA authorizing an unprecedented array of covert
actions against Al Qaeda and its leadership."
Rizzo
explained in 2011. One of those actions, Rizzo went on, was,
"the
capture, incommunicado detention and aggressive interrogation of senior Al
Qaeda operatives."
As Steven Aftergood, director of the
Federation
of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy,
noted
in 2009 - shortly after Hayden revealed that torture started as a covert
operation - this means there should be a paper trail implicating President
Bush in the torture program.
"[T]here should be a Presidential finding'
authorizing the program," he said, "and [] such a finding should have been
provided to Congressional overseers."
The
National Security Act dictates that every covert operation must be
supported by a written declaration finding that the action is necessary and
important to the national security.
The Congressional Intelligence committees - or
at least the Chair and Ranking Member - should receive notice of the
finding.
But there is evidence that those Congressional
overseers were never told that the finding the president signed on September
17, 2001 authorized torture.
For example, a
letter from then ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee,
Jane Harman, to the CIA's General Counsel following her first briefing on
torture asked:
"Have enhanced techniques been authorized and approved by the
President?"
The CIA's response at the time was simply that,
"policy as well
as legal matters have been addressed within the Executive Branch."
Nevertheless, the finding does exist.
The CIA
even
disclosed its existence in response to the ACLU FOIA, describing it as,
"a 14-page memorandum dated 17 September 2001 from President Bush to the
Director of the CIA pertaining to the CIA's authorization to detain
terrorists."
In an
order in the ACLU suit, Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein confirmed that the
declaration was "intertwined with" the administration's effort to keep the
language in the Tenet document hidden.
When the administration succeeded in
keeping that short phrase secret, all effort to release the declaration also
ended.
Enduring confusion about this particular finding
surely exists because of its flexible nature.
As Bob Woodward described in
Bush at War, CIA Director Tenet asked President Bush to sign,
"a
broad intelligence order permitting the CIA to conduct covert operations
without having to come back for formal approval for each specific
operation."
As Jane Mayer described in The Dark Side, such an order
not only gave the CIA flexibility, it also protected the President.
"To give
the President deniability, and to keep him from getting his hands dirty, the
finding called for the President to delegate blanket authority to Tenet to
decide on a case-by-case basis whom to kill, whom to kidnap, whom to detain
and interrogate, and how."
When George Tenet signed written guidelines for
the CIA's torture program in 2003, however, he appeared to have deliberately
deprived the President of that deniability by including the source of CIA's
authorization - presumably naming the President - in a document
interrogators would see.
You can't blame the CIA Director, after all; Tenet
signed the Guidelines just as CIA's Inspector General and DOJ started to
review the legality of the torture tactics used against detainees like Abd
al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who was threatened with a drill and a gun in violation
of DOJ's ban on mock executions.
Protecting the President?
The White House's fight to keep the short phrase
describing
Bush's authorization of the torture program hidden speaks to its
apparent ambivalence over the torture program.
Even after President Obama
released the DOJ memos authorizing torture - along with a damning CIA
Inspector General Report and a wide range of documents revealing
bureaucratic discussions within the CIA about torture - the White House
still fought the release of the phrase that would have made it clear that
the CIA conducted this torture at the order of the president.
And it did so
with a classified declaration from Jones that would have remained secret had
Judge Hellerstein not insisted it be made public.
As Aftergood noted, such White House
intervention in a FOIA suit is rare.
"The number of times that a national
security advisor has filed a declaration in a FOIA lawsuit is vanishingly
small," he said. "It almost never happens."
But as ACLU Deputy Legal
Director Jameel Jaffer noted of the finding,
"It was the original authority
for the CIA's secret prisons and for the agency's rendition and torture
program, and apparently it was the authority for the targeted killing
program as well. It was the urtext. It's remarkable that after all this
time it's still secret."
President Obama's willingness to go to such
lengths to hide this short phrase may explain the White House's
curious treatment of potentially privileged documents with the Senate now -
describing President Bush's authorization of the torture program and its
seemingly contradictory stance supporting publishing the Torture Report
while thwarting its completion by withholding privileged documents.
After
all, the documents in question, like the reference to the presidential
finding, may deprive the President of plausible deniability.
Furthermore, those documents may undermine one
of the conclusions of the
Torture Report.
According to Senator
Ron
Wyden, the Senate Torture Report found that,
"the CIA repeatedly provided
inaccurate information about its interrogation program to the White House."
Perhaps the documents reportedly withheld by the White House undermine this
conclusion, and instead show that
the CIA operated with the full consent and
knowledge of at least some people within the White House.
Finally, the White House's sensitivity about
documents involved in the torture program may stem from the structure of the
finding.
As John Rizzo made clear, the finding authorizes not just
torturing, but killing, senior al Qaeda figures. Bob Woodward even reported
that that CIA would carry out that killing using Predator drones, a program
CIA still conducts.
And in fact, when the Second Circuit ultimately
ruled to let the White House to keep the authorization phrase secret, it
did so because the phrase also relates to,
"a highly classified, active
intelligence activity" and "pertains to intelligence activities unrelated to
the discontinued [torture] program."
Given what we know about the September
17, 2001 finding, that may well refer to President Obama's still active
drone program.
In any case, the White House's seemingly
contradictory statements about the Torture Report might best be understood
by its past treatment of CIA documents.
By releasing the DOJ memos and other
materials, the White House provided what seemed to be unprecedented
transparency about what the CIA had done.
But all the while it was secretly
hiding language describing what the White House has done.
