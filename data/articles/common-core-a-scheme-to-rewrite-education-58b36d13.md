If something is not done soon, the vast majority
of American K-12 school children will be taught using dubious, federally
backed national education "standards" that have come under fire from across
the political spectrum.
America's kids, as well as their parents, will also
be monitored and tracked in unprecedented ways from early childhood into the
workforce. Opposition is growing by leaps and bounds, but government
officials are not yet backing down.
The controversial "standards" scheme, known
informally as "Common Core," is being foisted on state governments all
across the country with a combination of taxpayer-funded bribes, outright
deception, and federal bludgeoning. Despite America's long traditions of
local governance and separation of powers,
the Obama administration and its
establishment allies in both parties are determined to get the standards
rolled out nationwide.
So far, their progress has been remarkable.
Even with the backing of billionaire
Bill Gates
and the U.S. Department of Education, the entire "Common Core State
Standards Initiative," as it is referred to officially, was developed and
rolled out with almost no serious media attention.
The eerie silence, of
course, helped proponents avoid scrutiny in the early phases, when it would
have been much easier for critics to derail the scheme that will essentially
nationalize education - along with the minds of America's youth, and
therefore, the nation's future.
Education and policy experts who spoke with The
New American blasted the standards themselves, the centralization and
federalization of schooling, the long-term agenda behind the plan, and the
nefarious tactics used to advance it.
One critic, Tennessee Liberty Alliance
co-founder Glenn Jacobs, even suggested in a column that Common Core
proponents were seeking to produce what Russian communists referred to as
"New Soviet Men."
Others are calling the program "ObamaCore."
With the federal government handing out massive
grants only to state governments that comply, some 45 states and Washington,
D.C., have already signed up to implement the full plan. Among the few
states that have not jumped completely on the bandwagon, only Texas appears
to be standing firm, with Minnesota, Nebraska, Virginia, and Alaska all
reportedly flirting with various elements of the scheme.
Even the states that refuse to join - not to
mention homeschoolers and private schools - may find themselves ensnared in
the program due to national testing, college admission requirements, and
more.
However, experts expect resistance to accelerate.
The Standards
To avoid a national outcry, advocates of the
national standards started out by focusing just on mathematics and English,
two subjects expected to be the least controversial among the voting and
taxpaying public.
Even in those fields, however, critics have already
slammed the curricula as woefully inadequate and a step back in terms of
properly educating children. Meanwhile, standards for science and social
studies are already in the works.
Common Core proponents continually use vague
language about "excellence" in education, "raising the bar," and getting
America's children "ready for the workforce" as the reason the standards
should be implemented.
For critics, however, the standards, which are
copyrighted by the Washington, D.C.-based National Governors Association (NGA)
and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and were only
released in mid-2010, represent a major step backward. If something is not
done to stop it, opponents say, a vast educational experiment will begin
soon.
Among the most common criticisms leveled at the
English and Language Arts Common Core standards is the emphasis on reading
dry, technical writing - government documents and technical manuals, for
example - as opposed to literary classics. At least 50 percent of reading
assignments under the new standards will be "informational" texts.
Consider,
for instance, some of the "suggested" texts students are expected to read:
"Recommended Levels of Insulation" by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency/U.S. Department of Energy, or Executive Order 13423:
Strengthening
Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management.
While for some
students, such as those on a vocational track who will not go to college,
reading manuals may be appropriate, critics say a one-size-fits-all approach
for the nation is worse than counterproductive.
Opponents, even among those involved with the
standards, have been quick to lambaste the guidelines.
"The major problem is
the 50/50 division of reading instruction from K-12 - 10 standards for
informational text and nine for literature - meaning that literary study is
reduced and the opportunity for kids to develop critical thinking skills is
reduced," Dr. Sandra Stotsky, the 21st-century chair in teacher quality at
the University of Arkansas's Department of Education Reform, told The New
American about the new standards.
Dr. Sandra Stotsky, who refused to sign off on the
standards as a member of the largely for-show "Common Core Validation
Committee," said the English Language Arts (ELA) standards do not compare
well with existing standards in places such as Massachusetts, for example.
Numerous experts have pointed out that Massachusetts has actually been
forced to water down its existing, relatively successful standards to
conform with Common Core.
In English, an estimated 60 percent of the classic
literature, poetry, and drama previously required, such as Mark Twain's
Huckleberry Finn, has been stripped from the standards, according to
reports.
Despite all of the talk about "internationally
benchmarked" standards being met, Common Core falls short again.
Common Core
doesn't,
"compare with the kind of reading required for the Irish
school-leaving exam or for school exit literature exams in Alberta and
British Columbia," Dr. Stotsky continued, adding that the standards are
neither rigorous nor research-based.
"They were written hastily by people
who didn't care how poorly written they were so long as informational text
was about 50 percent of the reading curriculum."
While she is not opposed to national ELA
standards per se, assuming they are "first-class" and include
state-relevant material, the existing Common Core standards have got to go,
Stotsky said.
"They need to be drastically revised, and written by people
who have taught in K-12, know how to write ELA standards, and/or are
literary scholars or well-trained high-school English teachers," she
explained, adding that the standards should be "rejected."
Of course, criticism of the math standards has
been abundant as well. Another member of the Common Core Validation
Committee, Stanford professor Dr. James Milgram, refused to sign off on the
mathematics component.
"The Core Mathematics Standards are written to
reflect very low expectations," he said, calling them "as non-challenging as
possible" with "extremely serious failings."
In a letter outlining his
concerns, Dr. Milgram even pointed to "actual errors" in sixth- and
seventh-grade discussions about ratios and rates - "they are neither
mathematically correct nor especially clear."
Again, as with the English standards, some state
governments have had to lower their expectations to fall in line with Common
Core. In Minnesota, officials refused to adopt the math standards because,
"ours were more rigorous and matched where kids were mastering those
(skills) in their content areas," according to state Education Commissioner
Brenda Cassellius.
Because of Common Core in California, students will no
longer be required to take Algebra I by eighth grade.
Massachusetts will
also soon have students taking Algebra I in ninth grade or later rather than
eighth, as currently required.
While English and math are the first subjects to
be nationalized through Common Core, the aim is to eventually extend it to
other areas as well - social studies, science, history, and more.
High-school history teacher Thomas R. Eddlem
summarized some of the issues he sees with the scheme in a note to The
New American:
The real problem is that states have adopted
history standards that are entirely process standards, with no subject
content standards.
For example, there's nothing in Common Core about being
able to explain why America seceded from Britain, or how the Constitution
fulfills the ideal outlined in the Declaration of Independence of protecting
God-given rights.
It's all process, such as:
"Determine the meaning of words
and phrases as they are used in a text, including analyzing how an author
uses and refines the meaning of a key term over the course of a text."
As
well, nearly all of the curriculum map - the unit goals, essential
questions, resources used and assessment methods - is yet to be written.
States that have adopted the vaguely worded standards have done so without
the slightest clue as to how they will be implemented. Once the
"public-private partnership" that created the standards fills in the
details, that's where the bias of the authors will show their real teeth.
Some Common Core critics have found fault with
the "suggested" textbooks, as well.
In history, for example, is A
History of US, by Joy Hakim, a comprehensive textbook series on
American history almost universally regarded as having a strong liberal bias
- and worse.
"Examination of Hakim's material discloses many errors
(including errors of fact, of chronology and of terminology) as well as
unjustified assertions and some displays of bias," explained author and
historian Alice Whealey in a scathing analysis of the book series for the
Textbook League, which reviews educational material for accuracy.
"Joy Hakim
should not attempt to write about Western history, particularly the history
of Europe, because she obviously hasn't had enough training in these
subjects. It is a shame that Oxford University Press has let her get away
with so many falsehoods and with such extreme exhibitions of bias."
Soon,
however, children all across America will be reading the books.
In terms of science, the national standards'
shortcomings and controversies have received even more attention from
critics.
Known as the "Next Generation Science Standards," the scheme was
developed along with Common Core and managed by the same establishment-run
outfit. In essence, it will force American students to learn a steady stream
of controversial propaganda on everything from the theory of evolution to
largely debunked theories advanced by UN global-warming alarmists about
supposed human impacts on "climate change," opponents say.
"Human activities, such as the release of
greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current
rise in Earth's mean surface temperature (global warming),"
...the
elementary-school standards claim, despite the fact that even climate
alarmists admit there
has been no "global warming" in over 15 years and that
CO2 released from fossil fuels represents a tiny fraction of the greenhouse
gases present naturally in the atmosphere.
Evolution is also heavily
emphasized as "fundamental" in the controversial standards, even though more
than half of Americans reject the theory in scientific polls and, to date,
there is no fossil record showing one type of animal morphing into another,
despite millions of fossils collected.
Aside from the blatant propaganda and the
obvious political agenda in the standards, however, critics say the real
problem is in the centralization.
Even if the standards were
radically revised to be better than any in existence, or had been devised by
people with whom one may agree with politically, they can always be changed.
In fact, the organizations behind Common Core admit that explicitly:
"The
Standards are intended to be a living work: as new and better evidence
emerges, the Standards will be revised accordingly," says the official
website for the standards.
While proponents of Common Core point to some
countries with national standards that do better than the United States
academically as evidence of why the United States needs them as well, the
vast majority of nations where students perform more poorly than Americans
have nationalized education, too.
Top-down, one-size-fits-all education will
not improve outcomes, but it will almost certainly be used to control and
manipulate children, rewarding those who faithfully follow government dogma.
The problem with Common Core, then, aside from the poor standards
themselves, is largely philosophical and principled: Government should not
have such power in the first place.
The Real Agenda
Totalitarian leaders from Hitler to Stalin and
everywhere in between have always sought to centralize and control
education.
The reason is simple: Whoever molds the minds of the youth can
eventually dominate the population, even if it takes a generation or two.
That is why tyrants in recent centuries have demanded compulsory,
government-led education.
Hitler made clear that he wanted to use
"education" as a tool to mold German children in accordance with the
National Socialist regime's despotic and murderous ideology.
So did Stalin,
and numerous other infamous tyrants and mass-murderers.
As Karl Marx noted
in his Communist Manifesto,
government-controlled schooling is
essential to achieving the goals of socialism.
In his masterpiece On Liberty, renowned British philosopher and
parliamentarian John Stuart Mill succinctly explained the inherent problems
with government schools.
"A general State education is a mere contrivance
for molding people to be exactly like one another; and as the mould in
which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in the
government
it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading by natural
tendency to one over the body," he wrote.
In the United States, though, people are starting to wake up.
On the Left
and on the Right, criticism of Common Core standards, methods, and the
entire agenda continues to grow louder and louder. From the
libertarian-leaning Cato Institute to the establishment's liberal-oriented
Brookings Institution, the scheme is coming under assault. Increasing
numbers of teachers, experts, and more are speaking out, too.
Criticism of the standards and the expected results has grown so loud that
even some establishment media have finally been forced to report on the
controversies.
On April 6, for instance, the Washington Post
published a public-school teacher's resignation letter that lambasted the
program.
In his
now-public resignation letter to school officials, social
studies teacher Gerald Conti of New York said recent developments could no
longer be tolerated.
"Data driven' education seeks only conformity, standardization, testing and
a zombie-like adherence to the shallow and generic Common Core, along with a
lockstep of oversimplified so-called Essential Learnings," Conti wrote in
his letter, which has "gone viral" on the Internet.
"Creativity, academic
freedom, teacher autonomy, experimentation and innovation are being stifled
in a misguided effort to fix what is not broken in our system of public
education."
Even more alarming, perhaps, is what opponents of the plan say is an agenda
to essentially brainwash students.
Countless examples have been provided by
experts such as Dr. Stotsky and others on how texts and "analysis" are used
to guide students' thinking toward a pre-determined outcome.
Much of the
agenda involves what is euphemistically referred to as preparing students to
live in a "global community."
Mary Black, a veteran educator, has been sounding the alarm about Common
Core for months in public seminars about the standards.
Having spent almost
four decades teaching students of all ages before becoming curriculum
director at Freedom Project Education, an independent K-12 online classical
school, Black knows what works and what does not.
She warned that Common Core and its poor standards are part of a much broader
agenda, one that represents a "significant threat."
The standards, of course, are highly problematic in and of themselves.
"My
review of the Common Core standards indicated that they were designed to
teach students 'what' to think and not 'how' to think," Black said, echoing
concerns expressed by numerous analysts who have investigated the scheme.
"The literary classics have been stripped and replaced with books promoting
a socialist agenda... It is certain that it will leave students unable to
think for themselves."
However, there may be even more pressing problems, Black continued.
"As an
educator, I admit the poor standards are not my major concern," she said.
"It is what comes along with the standards that is most concerning."
Among
her examples, Black cited the fact that special interest groups, such as
tax-funded abortion giant Planned Parenthood, which participated in writing
the "National Sexuality Education Standards," will be given access to
American children.
Pointing to some of the controversial material - such as
asking students to identify different types of "family structures" and
discuss ways of "showing respect" toward them, for instance - she urged
parents with children in school to read the standards for themselves.
After
all, this goes against beliefs that both liberals and conservatives hold
dear.
For conservatives, such teaching will often fly in the face of moral
strictures they want to instill in their children. For liberals, the
standards, which require that teachers demean and belittle the beliefs of a
great majority of students, should smack of bullying and intolerance that
they so often preach against.
Black also noted that because Common Core is copyrighted, it cannot be
altered by anyone other than the owners of the copyright.
As such, any
special interest group that finds favor with those in charge will be able to
gain instant access to America's students. Concerned parents, meanwhile,
will be left with few-to-no options to prevent it.
According to Black and other experts, documentation also shows Common Core
is actually a step in the process toward achieving a longtime goal of the
United Nations and its supporters: a
one-world education system.
The UN, of
course, has long sought to harmonize global educational standards.
And billionaire Bill Gates
- one of the primary figures behind Common Core - has expressed
devotion to a similar agenda.
"Quite simply, control is the real goal," Black continued.
"Read about the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, David Coleman, Sir Michael Barber, Arne
Duncan, and the reality will become very clear. These people are socialists
and globalists. The goal is not education but the production of compliant,
dependent, uneducated citizens.
This is the citizenry needed to implement
the United Nation's Agenda 21 with the help of UNESCO's Education for All
program. Not surprisingly, Common Core and Education for All are very
similar because Bill Gates has been involved with both and is a proponent of
UN-directed education."
Indeed, Obama's Education Secretary Arne Duncan even admits openly that the
Department of Education is cooperating with groups such as the UN, often
dubbed a "dictators' club," to "improve" education in America.
Speaking to
UNESCO in late 2010, Duncan confirmed - albeit subtly and couched in
nice-sounding terms - elements of what he called the "cradle-to-career
education agenda" with goals that,
"can only be achieved by creating a strong
cradle-to-career continuum that starts with early childhood learning and
extends all the way to college and careers."
"Education is still the key to eliminating gender inequities, to reducing
poverty, to creating a sustainable planet, and to fostering peace," he said,
with "sustainability" being UN-speak for central planning and global
government.
"Today, education is a global public good unconstrained by
national boundaries.... It is no surprise that economic interdependence
brings new global challenges and educational demands."
Probably unintentionally, Duncan acknowledged against interest the top-down
structure of the new standardization, rather than bottom-up and directed by
parents.
He continued by telling UNESCO about the "unique opportunity to
transform our education system":
"I've said that America is now in the midst
of a quiet revolution' in school reform," Duncan continued.
"Before the
1960s, almost all policymaking and education funding was a state and local
responsibility. The Obama administration has sought to fundamentally shift
the federal role, so that the department is doing much more to support
reform and innovation in states, districts, and local communities."
Quoting former South African President Nelson Mandela, Duncan noted that
education,
"is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the
world."
"The United States provides over a billion
dollars annually to partner countries working on educational reform,"
Duncan boasted, as the federal government racks up trillions in debt.
"Our goal for the coming year will be to
work closely with global partners, including UNESCO, to promote
qualitative improvements and system-strengthening."
Non-CC States,
Homeschoolers, and Private Schools
Despite the growing outcry surrounding Common Core, analysts say that
without a significant change in course, it is only a matter of time before
the nationalized education scheme ensnares virtually every student in
America.
Homeschoolers, private-schooled children, and even kids in states
that have refused to participate will likely all be impacted by the
standards, sometimes without even being aware of it.
Consider, for example,
the rush by virtually all major publishers to align their textbooks with
Common Core. Most parents have no idea of the major changes taking place.
Meanwhile, a national testing regime based on the new standards is already
being rolled out, with the Common Core-aligned tests planned for
introduction by 2014.
Two "consortia" receiving hundreds of millions of
taxpayer dollars from the federal government, Smarter Balanced Assessment
Consortium (SBAC) and the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for
College and Careers (PARCC), were put in charge of developing standardized
tests to go along with Common Core.
Students will be tested regularly from
the third grade to ensure that their Common Core-based education is
proceeding smoothly. All of that private data will be available in
perpetuity to the federal government and other as-yet unknown parties.
Even students who do not live in one of the states using Common Core-aligned
standardized tests may ultimately be forced to learn from the same set of
standards.
Consultant David Coleman, widely regarded as the "architect" of
Common Core, became president of the College Board last year - all but
ensuring that the SATs, which are produced by the College Board, will be
aligned with the new standards. Of course, SATs are used nationwide in
admissions to higher-learning institutions.
If the testing regimes and the flood of Common Core-aligned textbooks are
not enough to guarantee that all American students learn from the same set
of controversial standards, there are other means being pursued as well.
While countless well-intentioned conservatives and libertarians have pushed
the idea of tax-funded "vouchers" for private schools, the use of taxpayer
money for private education may be a Trojan horse to ensure government
control.
In the state of Wisconsin's application for a waiver from
No Child
Left Behind, as just one example, that was illustrated clearly.
"The Accountability Design Team developed a statewide accountability
framework that specifically includes all state schools, including
traditional public schools and charter schools, regardless of Title funding,
as well as private schools participating in Parental Choice Programs
(PCP)," reads page 48 of Wisconsin's ESEA Flexibility Request.
"All
schools receiving state funds will be part of the state accountability and
support system."
Separately, Catholic schools across America are getting ready to deal with
Common Core as well. The National Catholic Education Association (NCEA) has
not "officially" endorsed the standards.
However, it is already working to
help Catholic schools prepare to implement the program, according to news
reports.
"What we have done at NCEA is develop what we call the Common Core
Catholic Identity Initiative," said Presentation Sister Dale McDonald,
director of public policy and educational research at the NCEA.
Critics say
despite not offering an "official endorsement" of the standards, the NCEA is
actively promoting Common Core. Other religious schools are reportedly
hopping on the bandwagon, too.
Even when state governments say no, that does not necessarily mean the end
of Common Core.
"In my home state where legislators responded to constituent
demand and halted implementation of CCSS [Common Core State Standards], some
teachers have publicly stated that they know best about education and
because they think it is best to teach to these standards, they intend to do
so," FPE's Mary Black said.
"The arrogance and elitism of the proponents of CCSS are apparent as they ignore the will of the people, including many
parents, which was duly exercised through legislative procedure."
While the controversial school-standardization scheme does not directly
apply to home educators yet, experts and advocates say the effects are
already starting to be felt.
The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA),
a non-profit organization dedicated to defending and advancing the
constitutional right of parents to direct the education of their children,
is on the front lines of the battle.
According to the HSLDA, which has been
expressing concerns about "Common Core" for years, the controversial scheme
is problematic for several reasons.
"Our concern with the Common Core is twofold," HSLDA Director of Federal
Relations William Estrada told The New American.
"The first is that the
success of homeschooling shows that kids do best when parents are in control
of educational decisions. Common Core centralizes what kids are taught, how
they are taught, and what they should learn, in the hands of a few
educational bureaucrats at the national level - completely cutting out
parents, teachers, and local school boards."
"The second major concern is that a national curriculum and national
standards will eventually be broadened to include homeschoolers, which would
eliminate the ability of parents to tailor their educational message to each
specific child," said Estrada.
A wide range of organizations and activists
have expressed similar fears about the national education scheme.
Indeed, the first symptoms of the "Common Core" problem are already being
felt by the homeschooling community.
Among the most serious: An increasing
number of home education-related companies have started aligning their
curricula and learning materials with the national program. In fact, at
least 10 popular homeschool curricula produced by various companies now
conform to the national scheme.
There are probably many more. With the
advent of testing next year, those numbers are expected to keep growing,
too.
How It Happened
The U.S. Department of Education was created by
an act of Congress and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in 1979,
and it has been gradually increasing in power since then.
Leaving centuries
of history aside, the modern effort to nationalize education picked up steam
in the 1990s, when a coalition of establishment-minded governors and
corporate titans came together to push the centralization agenda under the
guise of improving standards.
In 1996, Achieve, Inc. was born, giving a
major boost to the plan and to longtime proponents of smashing state and
local sovereignty in education, while centralizing control over schools at
the federal level through a byzantine "public-private partnership"
labyrinth.
The overarching agenda was summarized neatly in
a 2008 column on "education reform" for the Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) by former IBM CEO and current "Achieve" Chairman Emeritus Louis
Gerstner, Jr.
A prominent member of the
Council on Foreign Relations and a
Bilderberg summit attendee, Gerstner co-chaired Achieve until 2002, when he
formed the Teaching Commission with a list of prominent establishment
figures.
In the WSJ column, Gerstner offered
what he described as a,
"prescription for leadership from the Obama
administration."
Among the myriad recommendations: "abolish all local school
districts" and "establish a set of national standards for a core
curriculum." Also on the agenda were extending the school day and the school
year.
In 2009, the Washington, D.C.-based National
Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers - both
non-profit organizations despite official sounding names - quietly announced
their intent to create new standards. Achieve and its cohorts were put in
the driver's seat.
After hiring supposed "experts" to design the scheme, the
virtually unknown coalition quietly got to work drafting and pushing the
agenda to nationalize education.
Forces Behind Common
Core
That critics claim that one of the primary
agendas behind Common Core is not-before-seen social engineering should come
as no surprise, considering the process and forces behind the standards.
Laboring in secret, faceless bureaucrats with little to no experience in
relevant fields - identified publicly only after a major public outcry - put
together the scheme with funding from trade groups and massive tax-exempt
foundations.
A for-show "Validation Committee" was set up, though criticism
from the committee's experts was largely ignored.
The most high-profile foundation to bankroll
Common Core - and reportedly the biggest single source of funds - was the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a Rockefeller-allied organization with a
dubious history of financing everything from population control and
pro-abortion forces to various United Nations agencies and schemes.
In 2010,
the Gates Foundation even received the "Population Award" from the UN
Population Fund (UNFPA), which was exposed in Congress for facilitating the
Communist Chinese dictatorship's barbaric "one-child policy" and coerced
abortions.
Other UNFPA award winners include Planned Parenthood, also
financed by Gates.
Speaking to the National Conference of State
Legislators, billionaire
Bill Gates, who made his fortune in computer
software, explained one of the long-term goals of Common Core.
"We'll know
we've succeeded when the curriculum and the tests are aligned to these
standards," he said.
In a nutshell, that is the endgame:
a national
educational system run from the shadows by unaccountable forces that will
ultimately capture the minds of America's youth at an early age.
In addition to the Gates foundation, the Charles
Stewart Mott Foundation, also close to the United Nations and a big funder
of "sustainability" causes, helped fund the development of Common Core as
well.
Another controversial non-profit involved in
Common Core is the Carnegie Corporation of New York, an establishment
powerhouse that funds everything from the Council on Foreign Relations to
the Atlantic Council.
Unsurprisingly, the CFR itself has been a
staunch proponent of the standards.
Federal Carrots and
Sticks
Almost immediately following the public
announcement on Common Core, the Obama administration and the federal
leviathan it leads began the push to ensure compliance nationwide.
Indeed, widespread acceptance of Common Core
thus far has been almost exclusively attributed to the taxpayer largess
offered under various programs.
One key element in getting states to comply was
the $50 billion "State Fiscal Stabilization Fund," part of the 2009
"stimulus" bill, which distributed funds to state governments that agreed to
adopt Common Core and create or improve systems to track students (see "Orwellian
Nightmare: Data-mining Your Kids").
Obama's controversial and unconstitutional $10
billion "Race to the Top" program was also crucial. Billions of federal
dollars have been awarded to state governments from a fund for the scheme,
which was also established with $4.5 billion under the 2009 so-called
stimulus bill. With federal aid, of course, comes federal control.
And to be eligible for the massive grants, state
governments were forced to adopt Common Core or other "internationally
benchmarked standards" while creating "data systems" to track students.
Some $350 million was set aside,
"to help fund common assessments for states
that adopt common international standards," the Department of Education
announced, referring to the national testing regime set to be rolled out
as early as next year.
Unveiled at a 2009 event at U.S. Department of
Education headquarters was an array of other federal grants worth billions
of dollars - much of it from the "stimulus" bill - aimed at usurping control
over education and America's youth from families and communities.
Among the programs outlined in a Department of
Education press release: a $650 million "Investing in Innovation Fund," a
$297 million "Teacher Incentive Fund," and more. Another $3.5 billion
in "School Improvement Grants" was earmarked for states to support "efforts
to reform struggling schools."
Another key element in getting state governments
to agree to the national standards was the issuance of waivers from the
Bush-era "No Child Left Behind."
Without authority from Congress, the Department
of Education announced in 2011 that it would grant waivers from NCLB to
state governments in exchange for obedience to various federal decrees and
the adoption of Common Core or other standards approved by the
administration. Acceptance of Common Core-aligned testing was also required.
More than a few members of Congress and state
officials feigned outrage by the waiver-in-exchange-for-obedience-to-Obama
scheme, but the administration went forward anyway.
Local school districts are in the
administration's crosshairs as well.
In May of 2012, the U.S. Department of Education
began offering huge taxpayer-funded incentives to school districts that
adopted the controversial scheme.
"This district-level program is a full-scale
assault on state sovereignty," explains the group Truth in American
Education, which opposes the Common Core plan.
"It is a power-grab through which the
federal government will skirt citizens' elected statewide bodies and
negotiate directly with school districts to embrace federal policy.
It
will also undermine the state governmental structure by grouping school
districts together on policy decisions and thereby making it more
difficult for the group to disengage from federal programming."
Skirting the Law and the
People
Proponents of Common Core continue to downplay
concerns about the controversial scheme by incessantly parroting two primary
lines:
the standards are "state-led" and
"voluntary."
Because multiple federal laws specifically
prohibit any federal direction, control, or supervision of curricula,
programs of instruction, and instructional material in elementary or
secondary schools, the whole scheme would be unlawful - not to mention
unconstitutional - if the standards were not, in fact, "state-led" and
"voluntary."
However, the idea that Common Core is being
driven by state governments is easily shown to be bogus - neither
legislators nor elected officials played any significant role in developing
the scheme, and in fact, states had to agree to the standards in 2009,
before the standards were even published, to be eligible for federal bribes.
Instead, as even establishment analysts have
admitted, Common Core is a set of national standards pushed by the
federal government and created by "consultants" funded by unaccountable
billionaires.
Dr. Sandra Stotsky explained that when,
"states signed on to common core standards,
they did not realize
that they were transferring control of the school
curriculum to the federal government."
Even if it were truly a "state-led" initiative,
however, critics say it would still be a bad idea, as parents and local
school districts continue to lose control over education.
Are the standards voluntary? For now, the
argument could be made that they are technically not mandatory, since no
state government can be forced to comply.
However, the fact that the federal government is
bribing state governments with taxpayer money to go along with the plan -
not to mention the federally funded national testing regimes - virtually
ensures that American students will have to submit to some elements of
Common Core whether they want to or not.
Political Opposition
Despite the fact that Common Core has been in
the works for years and already spread its tentacles far and wide under the
radar, Americans are gradually waking up to the plot.
Opposition to the standards is soaring, as well.
In Congress, lawmakers are making various moves to stop the scheme. At the
state level, more than a few state governments are working on efforts to
withdraw.
The powerful Republican National Committee (RNC)
adopted a resolution calling on the GOP to stand firm against the
centralization plot.
Heavy-hitting organizations and grassroots
activists across America are getting fired up, too, organizing protests and
working with policymakers at all levels. Even Big Labor is calling for a
moratorium on implementing some parts of the scheme.
In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Charles Grassley
(R-Iowa) has been leading the opposition so far. With outrage growing
nationwide about Common Core, Grassley began circulating a letter among his
colleagues calling for a prohibition on the Department of Education's bribes
to state governments.
If approved, the proposed measure would also stop
federal funding of the nominally private entities working to develop the
standards. The Grassley letter, dated April 26, was sent to
the Senate Appropriations Committee's Education Subcommittee leadership.
It
was signed by eight other senators:
-
Mike Lee (R-Utah)
-
Tom Coburn (R-Okla.)
-
James Inhofe (R-Okla.)
-
Deb Fischer (R-Neb.)
-
Rand Paul (R-Ky.)
-
Pat Roberts (R-Kan.)
-
Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.)
-
Ted Cruz (R-Texas)
The coalition of senators sought an amendment to
the appropriations bill funding the Department of Education that would
restore state decision-making.
"The decision about what students should be
taught and when it should be taught has enormous consequences for our
children," the senators wrote.
"Therefore, parents ought to have a straight
line of accountability to those who are making the decisions. State
legislatures, which are directly accountable to the citizens of their
states, are the appropriate place for those decisions to be made, free
from any pressure from the U.S. Department of Education."
In the House of Representatives, lawmakers were
also working to stop Common Core.
Led by Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.), a
coalition including over 30 congressmen sent a letter to Education Secretary
Arne Duncan outlining their concerns.
The lawmakers also suggested that the Obama
administration was moving forward with "education policy reform" without
authorization or input from Congress.
"Such an action is, at best, in
contravention with precedent," the representatives wrote, noting that
the authority to move forward with some of the administration's schemes
ended in 2008 without congressional reauthorization.
"As representatives from states across the
nation, we understand the diverse cultures and state-specific education
needs that exist in America," the House letter to Secretary Duncan
explains.
"Moreover, we believe that state-based
education policies are vital to the successful education of a child. As
with most one-size-fits-all policies, Common Core standards fail to
address the specific needs of our states."
More recently, the House of Representatives
passed a bill on July 19 aimed at reducing the unconstitutional federal role
in education while restraining the administration's abuse of "No Child Left
Behind" waivers as a tool to coerce state governments.
However, the legislation is not expected to go
far in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Plus, Obama has reportedly already
threatened to veto the House measure, dubbed the Student Success Act, all
but ensuring its demise.
At the state level, policymakers in some 20
states are working to stop Common Core, too, according to data compiled by
researchers. Aside from all of the other major controversies surrounding the
centralization of education and the standards themselves, the expected costs
to taxpayers are reportedly starting to raise some eyebrows in state
capitols.
According to estimates cited by the
conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, which has blasted Common Core on
multiple fronts, the implementation of the new standards could cost
cash-strapped state governments some $16 billion.
More than a few states have started fighting
back. In Indiana, for example, the legislature passed a bill putting Common
Core implementation on "pause" pending a proper review of the standards, the
costs, and more.
"I have long believed that education is a
state and local function and we must always work to ensure that our
students are being taught to the highest academic standards and that our
curriculum is developed by Hoosiers, for Hoosiers," declared Republican
Gov. Mike Pence in May when he signed the legislation.
The state has also reportedly stopped
participating in the national testing regime, too - at least for now.
Michigan and South Carolina have targeted the scheme, as well.
Multiple other state legislatures also have
bills to withdraw from Common Core. Separately, several states have also
withdrawn from the national testing consortia. School districts, too, are
taking action, with the Douglas County, Colorado, district, for instance,
recently approving a resolution unanimously rejecting Common Core in favor
of its own higher-quality standards. Experts say this is just the beginning
of the resistance.
At the grassroots level, citizens all across
America are rallying to stop the new standards in their states. Online
rallies on Twitter organized by Parent Led Reform and Truth in American
Education in April and May reached millions of people.
With organizations nationwide such as,
...and countless others expressing firm
opposition, the groundswell of activism is expected to keep growing.
In the media, more than a few heavyweights, such
as Glenn Beck, have been helping to stir opposition as well.
In a series of interviews with The New American,
Joy Pullmann, education research fellow with the non-partisan
Heartland Institute, outlined resistance to Common Core.
In late July, she said that despite summer
typically being slow for legislation, there had been several noteworthy
developments.
Among the most important: The number of states
dropping or considering dropping Common Core tests is growing. In Florida,
for example, the state's top lawmakers issued a strongly worded letter
calling on the Sunshine State to quit the Common Core-aligned testing
consortium.
Oklahoma, Alabama, and Utah have already done
so, and North Dakota just dropped its membership in one of the testing
groups.
"Because the tests are the linchpin and
capstone of Common Core, and to me the very worst of the whole edifice,
I'd say this is a big deal and will accelerate," Pullmann concluded.
It appears to analysts that Common Core is the
final step in the decades-old process of nationalizing education - a
longtime goal of virtually every totalitarian regime in recent history.
With the minds of the youth and the future of
America at stake, it is time to turn the tide and get government out of the
way. With the groundswell of opposition continuing to expand, it is
certainly possible.
A good place to start would be getting the
federal government out of schools entirely and immediately by shutting down
the Department of Education.
