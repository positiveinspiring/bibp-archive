It may be a revelation to many people that the global drug trade is
controlled and run by the intelligence agencies. In this global drug trade
British intelligence reigns supreme.
As intelligence insiders know
MI-5 and
MI-6 control many of the other intelligence
agencies in the world (CIA, MOSSAD etc) in a vast web of intrigue and
corruption that has its global power base in the city of London, the square
mile. My name is James Casbolt, and I worked for MI-6 in 'black ops'
cocaine trafficking with the IRA and MOSSAD in London and Brighton between
1995 and 1999.
My father Peter Casbolt was also MI-6 and worked
with the CIA and mafia in Rome, trafficking cocaine into Britain. My
experience was that the distinctions of all these groups became blurred
until in the end we were all one international group working together for
the same goals. We were puppets who had our strings pulled by global puppet
masters based in the city of London. Most levels of the intelligence
agencies are not loyal to the people of the country they are based in and
see themselves as 'super national'.
It had been proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the CIA has been bringing
in most of the drugs into America for the last fifty years (see ex LAPD
officer Michael Rupert's 'From
the wilderness' website for proof).
The CIA operates under orders from
British intelligence and was created by British intelligence in 1947.
The CIA today is still loyal to the
international bankers based in the city of London and the global elite
aristocratic families like
the Rothschild's and
the Windsor's. Since it was first started,
MI-6 has always brought drugs into Britain. They do not bring 'some' of the
drugs into Britain but I would estimate MI-6 bring in around ninety percent
of the drugs in.
They do this by pulling the strings of many
organized crime and terrorist groups and these groups like the IRA are full
of MI-6 agents.
MI-6 bring in heroin from the middle east, cocaine from south America and
cannabis from morocco as well as other places. British intelligence also
designed and created the drug LSD in the 1950's through places like the
Tavistock Institute in London. By the 1960's MI-5, MI-6 and the
CIA were using LSD as a weapon against the angry protestors of the sixties
and turned them into 'flower children' who were too tripped out to organize
a revolution.
Dr
Timothy Leary the LSD guru of the
sixties was a CIA puppet. Funds and drugs for Leary's research came from the
CIA and Leary says that Cord Meyer, the CIA agent in charge of
funding the sixties LSD counter culture has "helped me to understand my
political cultural role more clearly".
In 1998, I was sent 3000 LSD doses on blotting
paper by MI-5 with pictures of the European union flag on them. The MI-5 man
who sent them told my father this was a government 'signature' and this LSD
was called 'Europa'.
This global drugs trade controlled by British intelligence is worth at least
500 billion a year. This is more than the global oil trade and the economy
in Britain and America is totally dependent on this drug money. Mafia crime
boss John Gotti exposed the situation when asked in court if he was
involved in drug trafficking.
He replied "No we can't compete with the
government".
I believe this was only a half truth because the
mafia and the CIA are the same group at the upper levels. In Britain, the
MI-6 drug money is laundered through the Bank of England, Barclays Bank and
other household name companies. The drug money is passed from account to
account until its origins are lost in a huge web of transactions.
The drug money comes out 'cleaner' but not
totally clean. Diamonds are then bought with this money from the corrupt
diamond business families like the Oppenheimers.
These diamonds are then sold and the drug money
is clean. MI-6 and the CIA are also responsible for the crack cocaine
epidemic in Britain and America. In 1978, MI-6 and the CIA were in south
America researching the effects of the natives smoking 'basuco' cocaine
paste. This has the same effect as crack cocaine. They saw that the strength
and addiction potential was far greater than ordinary cocaine and created
crack cocaine from the basuco formula.
MI-6 and the CIA then flooded Britain and
America with crack.
Two years later, in 1980, Britain and America
were starting to see the first signs of the crack cocaine epidemic on the
streets. On august 23, 1987, in a rural community south of Little Rock in
America, two teenage boys named Kevin Ives and Don Henry were
murdered and dismembered after witnessing a CIA cocaine drop that was part
of a CIA drug trafficking operation based at a small airport in Mena,
Arkansas.
Bill Clinton was the governor of Arkansas
at the time. Bill Clinton was involved with the CIA at this time and $100
million worth of cocaine was coming through the
Mena, Arkansas airport each month.
For proof see the books 'Compromise' and 'Dope
Inc'.
On my father's international MI-6 drug runs, whatever fell off the back of
the lorry so to speak he would keep and we would sell it in Britain. As long
as my father was meeting the speedboats from Morocco in the Costa del Sol
and then moving the lorry loads of cannabis through their MI-6, IRA lorry
business into Britain every month, British intelligence were happy.
As long as my father was moving shipments of
cocaine out of Rome every month, MI5 and MI6 were happy. If my father kept a
bit to sell himself no one cared because there was enough drugs and money to
go round in this Â£500 billion a year global drugs trade. The ones who were
really paying were the people addicted. Who were paying with suffering.
But karma always catches up and both myself and
my father became addicted to heroin in later years and my father died
addicted, and poor in prison under very strange circumstances. Today, I am
clean and drug-free and wish to help stop the untold suffering this global
drugs trade causes.
The intelligence agencies have always used
addictive drugs as a weapon against the masses to bring in their long term
plan for a one world government, a one world police force designed to be
NATO and a micro chipped population known as the
New
World Order. As the population is in a drug or alcohol-induced
trance watching 'Coronation Street', the new world order is being crept in
behind them.
To properly expose this global intelligence run drugs trade we need to
expose the key players in this area:
-
Tibor Rosenbaum, a MOSSAD agent
and head of the Geneva based Banque du Credit international. This
bank was the forerunner to the notorious Bank of Credit and
Commerce international (BCCI) which is a major intelligence drug
money laundering bank. 'Life' magazine exposed Rosenbaum's bank as a
money launderer for the Meyer Lanksky American organized crime
family and Tibor Rosenbaum funded and supported 'Permindex' the MI6
assassination unit which was at the heart of the John F. Kennedy
assassination.
-
Robert Vesco, sponsored by the
Swiss branch of the Rothchilds and part of the American connection
to the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia.
-
Sir Francis de Guingand, former
head of British intelligence, now living in south Africa (and
every head of MI5 and MI6 has been involved in the drug world before
and after him).
-
Henry Keswick, chairman of
Jardine Matheson which is one of the biggest drug trafficking
operations in the world. His brother John Keswick is chairman of the
bank of England.
-
Sir Martin Wakefield Jacomb,
Bank of England director from 1987 to 1995, Barclays Bank
Deputy Chairman in 1985, Telegraph newspapers director in 1986
(This is the reason why this can of worms doesn't get out in the
mainstream media. The people who are perpetrating these crimes
control most of the mainstream media. In America former director of
the CIA William Casey was, before his death in 1987, head of the
council of the media network ABC. Many insiders refer to ABC as 'The
CIA network.)
-
George Bush, Snr, former President and former head of
the CIA and America's leading drug baron who has fronted more wars
on drugs than any other president. Which in reality is just a
method to eliminate competition. A whole book could be written
on George Bush's involvement in the global drug trade but it is
well-covered in the book 'Dark
Alliance' by investigative journalist Gary Webb.
Gary Webb was found dead with two gunshot
wounds to the back of his head with a revolver. The case was declared a
'suicide'. You figure that out. Gary Webb as well as myself and other
investigators, found that much of this 'black ops' drug money is being used
to fund projects classified above top secret.
These projects include the building and
maintaining of
deep level underground bases in,
-
Dulce in New Mexico
-
Pine Gap in Australia
-
Snowy mountains in Australia
-
The Nyala range in Africa
-
west of Kindu in Africa
-
next to the Libyan border in Egypt
-
Mount Blanc in Switzerland
-
Narvik in Scandinavia
-
Gottland island in Sweden,
...and many other places around the world (more
about these underground bases in my next issue).
The information on this global drugs trade run
by the intelligence agencies desperately needs to get out on a large scale.
Any information, comments or feedback to help me
with my work would be greatly welcomed.
