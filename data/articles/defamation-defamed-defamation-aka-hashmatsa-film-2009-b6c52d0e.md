I dispute David Hirsh's
criticism of my film about antisemitism.
Far from
'easy targets', it is a difficult debate Israel must have.
In David Hirsh's critique of my film Defamation, he accused me of finding
"easy targets" as subjects for my film. I can only assume that "targets" is
common terminology for him; quite simply, all the subjects in my film
(including him) are people who willingly chose to participate.
Let me start with the first person he chose to label "an easy target": my
beloved 94-year-old grandmother.
My grandmother lost her husband, my
biological grandfather, in the 1948 war of independence, in which he served
as an officer with the forces defending Jerusalem; she was left with two
young children, my mother and her brother (he is the Israeli ambassador in
Germany).
She then married the man I knew as a grandfather, an Auschwitz
survivor who became a freedom fighter in
the Ezel - the underground movement
that operated alongside the Haganah and Lechi.
My grandmother loved the film and was proud to take part.
Hirsh sees her as
an "easy target", and although I personally completely disagree with what
she stated on camera, her perspective represents the very early Zionists
thinkers such as
Nordau, who wrote Degeneration, and Herzel,
"the visionary
of the [Jewish] state".
This small and marginal group (representing less
than 3% of the entire Jewish population at the time) were young, secular,
socialist Jews who wanted to create a "muscle" Jew; a Jew who would be
different from all of what they resented in their parents' generation.
My
grandmother is a genuine representative of this school of thought. She opens
the film, not only because she is a great character who expresses what many
people of her generation and, in fact, many Israelis feel toward diaspora
Jews, but she is a reminder of the vicious cycle that Zionism became caught
in - the state that was supposed to be a cure for what antisemitism started,
as both Foxman and Finkelstein are actually saying, has ended up generating
antisemitism.
The next "easy target" is
the ADL.
I don't see how an organization operating
on $70,000,000 a year can be considered an easy target.
Abe Foxman, whom I
actually like and have a great sympathy for, is one of the most influential
figures in the Jewish world of diplomacy, who meets with world leaders,
heads of states and foreign ministers.
When I approached the ADL, I came
with the intention of learning, and after spending many hours with Foxman
and key members of the ADL, I believe that they are doing what they are
doing because of their true concern for Israel, and a real wish to help the
Jewish state. Unfortunately, even though I can understand their drive, I
totally disagree with it.
A scene that I witnessed, at the end of their Auschwitz visit, is a sort of
game in which each of the ADL members has to name five non-Jewish friends
who would hide him if someone came knocking at their door - with reference
to the Nazis passing from house to house looking for Jews.
As the game
continued and none of them could think of five gentiles who would protect
them, they then go down to three, then one
and sadly, they cannot think of
a one righteous soul who would come to their aid.
The lesson is, as Foxman's
book is appropriately titled, "never again".
I am happy to say that, at
least in in my Tel Aviv social circle, this is not a very popular game; in
fact, I was quite shocked to have witnessed it in Auschwitz. But it was a
great insight into that mindset.
In their blind support of Israel, which is the supposed means for fulfilling
this "never again" dictum, they are contributing to a place that is driving
itself towards the edge of a cliff. Thanks to US support, the drive is a
very smooth, air-conditioned and fast.
But, nevertheless, it is headed
towards a cliff.
I can only encourage every Jew living in the western world, when next
visiting Israel, to detour from
the 433 Highway into the capital and
accompany an Arab Israeli in his search for an apartment in one of the
Jewish cities (such as Tel Aviv, Holon and Petach Tikva) and to take a short
trip into Nablus or Ramallah.
If they have any sense of human dignity, it
will change the way they look at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
But I am sure that most of the educated, liberal and mostly very pleasant
people I met in my travels with the ADL are blinded by a false image of
Israel.
An image that blinds them as they travel from Ben Gurion airport to
the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, to the many empty holiday apartments they
keep in Jerusalem, which they occupy maybe one week a year; on
the 443
Highway, which is prohibited for the Palestinians to travel, although it
passes right through the middle of their land.
No "easy targets" here, but
simply a group of very influential group of people who will go to great
lengths defending and securing their "insurance policy" - Israel.
David Hirsh also referred to the interviews with the group of black
residents whom I met in Crown Heights, where both blacks and Jews live,
although in fairly segregated circumstances. In this scene, a local Jewish
reporter claims that if a (black) robber wanted to rob someone, he would
choose a Jewish person, because "a Jewish person would be an easier target".
The black residents replied that,
"actually, if they got caught robbing a
Jewish guy, the judges would sentence them to more [prison] time because
they would classify it as a hate crime".
They went on, expressing many
stereotypes about Jews, ending up with a sad reference to the Protocols of
the Elders of Zion.
Is this antisemitism? Of course it is.
The question is,
what would be the best way to deal with it? A wise local rabbi acknowledged
the problem but blames the ADL for inflaming situations like these, because,
as he says,
"Foxman needs a job."
Finally, we come to the group of "15-year-old Israeli students on their trip
to Poland", as Hirsh says (in fact, the students were between 17 and 18
years old during the filming, and as you are reading these lines many of
them have enlisted in the Israeli army).
When the film came out in Israel, I
invited the whole class and their parents to the premiere at
Doc Aviv
documentary film festival. These intelligent young high school students
responded very openly and honestly to the film. Adi, the young woman who is
one of the main protagonists in the class, told me that it gave her a lot to
think about and thanked me for making the film.
Their teacher, Assaf,
responded in a similar way.
I don't blame these kids for acting the way they did. Most of them were
flying out of Israel for the first time, and being brought up thinking that
everybody hates them, find themselves in a cycle that is very hard to break.
I could go on further to address the rest of these "easy targets" Hirsh
accuses me of taking advantage, such as Norman Finkelstein, a bestselling
author and academic; Dina Porat, head of the center for research on
antisemitism at Tel Aviv university; or Charles Jakob, who is very active
online, but I think the point is clear: these are people who are passionate
about their views and are very happy to share them with me.
I am a filmmaker
who simply gave them the floor.
Hirsh wonders why is my narration in English? This is a version narrated for
an English-speaking audience, and obviously my narration is in Hebrew for
the version shown in Israel. In Germany, it will probably be dubbed into
German; in France, into French, and so on. There is no hidden agenda about
the intended audience, simply basic requirements set by different
broadcasters.
Hirsh concludes his article by regretting that he was not invited to speak
at this year's conference about how to combat antisemitism convened by the
Israeli foreign office, which he attributes as probably caused by his
appearance the film.
But I can inform him that, at this year's conference,
Abe Foxman stated that the situation of antisemitism is the worst since the
second world war, just as he had said last year and just as he will probably
say next year, too.
At the conference I filmed, Hirsh regrets he came out as a hero - his
interpretation, of course, as I never declared him one. But in that year, he
was the only one speaker who said anything disputing the general consensus
and for that, I thought he deserved credit.
It is true there are many Israelis who oppose the occupation and other
violations of human rights; but unfortunately, there are not enough.
The
current Israeli government is the most nationalist, rightwing government in
the history of the state of Israel. Those few who oppose and fight against
racism, and violations of human rights, risking their freedom - last week,
the head of the Israeli human rights association was arrested for
demonstrating against the taking over of Palestinian homes in east Jerusalem
- those I consider heroes.
In fact, my new film is about these unsung
heroes.
Defamation is the personal quest of an Israeli Jew trying to understand
certain aspects of his society and raising issues that I, living in Israel,
don't think are discussed enough.
I am very happy to read all the comments
and debates the film has started in the UK:
starting a discussion around
this subject is something I was waiting for and the many responses here just
prove that it is a discussion many are interested in.
As for David Hirsh, I
warmly invite him, next time he is in Israel, to join me for a tour of the
occupied territories.

Israeli director Yoav Shamir embarks on a
provocative - and at times irreverent - quest to answer the question,
-
"What is anti-Semitism today?"
-
Does it remain a dangerous and immediate threat?
-
Or
is it a scare tactic used by right-wing Zionists to discredit their critics?
Speaking with an array of people from across the political spectrum
(including the head of the Anti-Defamation League and its fiercest critic,
author Norman Finkelstein) and traveling to places like Auschwitz (alongside
Israeli school kids) and Brooklyn (to explore reports of violence against
Jews), Shamir discovers the realities of anti-Semitism today.
His findings
are shocking, enlightening and - surprisingly - often wryly funny.
