The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
has again delayed the introduction of position limits required under the
Dodd-Frank Act.
These limits are intended to prevent speculation
in (among other things) agricultural commodities, speculation which, many
critics argue, have driven up the price of food worldwide and plunged
millions into hunger.
In late 2006, the price of food and other commodities began rising
precipitately, continuing throughout 2007 and peaking in 2008. Millions were
cast below the poverty line and food riots erupted across the developing
world, from Haiti to Mozambique.
While analysts initially framed the crisis in
terms of market fundamentals (such as rising population, increased demand
for resource-intensive food, declining stockpiles, biofuel and agricultural
subsidies, and crop shortfalls from natural disasters), a growing number of
experts have tied the massive spikes to financial intermediation.
As economist Jayati Ghosh explains:
It is now quite widely acknowledged that
financial speculation was the major factor behind the sharp price rise
of many primary commodities , including agricultural items over the past
year...
Even recent research from the World Bank (Bafis
and Haniotis 2010) recognizes the role played by the financialisation
of commodities in the price surges and declines, and notes that price
variability has overwhelmed price trends for important commodities.
Trading Regulation for
Financialisation
This kind of speculation was made possible by deregulation in the US
financial sector, in particular the Commodity Futures Modernization Act
2000 (CFMA),
exempting commodity futures trading from regulatory oversight.
Crucially for our narrative, this removed limits
on the number of contracts that could be held at any one time (called
position limits) from the equation.
Firms like,
-
Goldman Sachs
-
Morgan Stanley
-
Barclays,
...began developing index funds (collective
investment schemes) based on these commodities, specializing in buying
futures contracts in the belief that the future price will be higher than
the present price.
Journalist Fred Kaufman eloquently stated
this in his Harpers article The Food Bubble:
Goldman Sachs envisioned a new form of
commodities investment, a product for investors who had no taste for the
complexities of corn or soy or wheat, no interest in weather and
weevils, and no desire for getting into and out of shorts and longs -
investors who wanted nothing more than to park a great deal of money
somewhere, then sit back and watch that pile grow.
All manner of institutional investors began
dumping capital into these funds, driving prices, and profits, through the
roof:
As the global financial system became
fragile with the continuing implosion of the US housing finance market,
large investor, especially institutional investors such as hedge funds
and pension funds and even banks, searched for other avenues of
investment to find new sources for profit.
Commodity speculation
increasingly emerged as an important area for such financial
investment.
Traditionally, futures contracts play an
important role in price discovery, reducing the price risk of the commodity
itself.
However without a limit to the number of
commodity futures contracts that could be held, investors were able to
withhold huge amounts of food from entering the market. When combined with
the real supply and demand factors mentioned above, this spelt volatile
price spikes; between 2005 and 2008 the price of maize nearly tripled, wheat
prices increased by 127%, and rice by 170%.
Throughout the crisis, at least 40 million
people went driven into hunger, and the number of people driven into extreme
poverty rose from 130 to 150 million.
And worse, this speculation wasnt limited to the 2007-2008 period. While
commodity prices fell again in 2009, the latter half of 2010 saw them again
skyrocket, reaching an all-time high at the end of that year, and remaining
high into this year.
Today, over a billion people remain hungry,
while wealthy investors continue to reap huge profits by gambling on the
stomachs of the worlds most vulnerable.
Dodd-Frank Reform
Following the global financial crisis, Representative Barney Frank and the
Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Chris Dodd proposed
legislation to boost US financial stability.
The
Dodd-Frank Act provided sweeping financial
reforms to the US financial sector, including reforms to commodity futures
regulation.
Section 737 (4) requires the CFTC
to,
establish limits on the amount of
positions, as appropriate, other than bona fide hedge position, that may
be held by any person with respect to contracts of sale for future
delivery or with respect to options on the contracts or commodities
traded on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market.
These limits should,
"to the maximum extent practicable...
diminish, eliminate, or prevent excessive speculation... [and] deter and
prevent market manipulation, squeezes and corners...
So far so good right, problem solved? Think again...
The legislation provided a 270-day
window in which position limits were to be put in place, meaning that by the
17th of April this year, this problem should have been solved, or, at the
very least, ameliorated. However that date came and went, and the CFTC
failed to reach agreement. A new date was set for the 4th of
October, however that date also came and went with no further advance.
CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler responded,
saying,
Were not trying to do this against a
clock. Were trying to do this in a way that gets it right. So a few
more weeks is a small thing for us to be concerned with if were going
to get it thought through in a better way.
The rules have now been delayed until October
18.
The Speculators Fight
Back
The CFTC isnt so much concerned with world hunger as its reason for
regulating commodity futures, and has hardly addressed the issue in public
statements. However futures trading also affects other commodities such as
oil, gold and silver, all of which have risen sharply over the past few
years.
Robert Pollin and James Heintz of
the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts
calculate that,
...the average US consumer paid a
83-cent-per-gallon premium in May for their gasoline purchases due to
the huge rise in the speculative futures market for oil. Considering the
US economy as a whole, this translates into a speculation premium of
over $1 billion for May alone.
Of the May price were to hold for a year,
that would mean that the speculative premium would total $12 billion.
The price of oil seems to be the CFTCs main
focus regarding position limits.
And its something that is hotly contested, as
speculative investors recoil in horror at the idea of their profit blade
being diminished. Their effect is indeed being felt, as Reuters reported in
mid-September that internal strife at the CFTC had slowed the progress of
the position limits rule, and they were struggling to harmonize it with
other regulations required under Dodd-Frank.
Leaked documents give us a picture of what the final regulation might look
like. The CFTC has proposed a limit of 25% of the deliverable supply of the
underlying commodity, a pitifully weak threshold that would allow four
financial entities to dominate an entire commodity market.
Indeed these limits might even encourage
speculation, while other proposed rules would allow companies to avoid
aggregating positions in different trading accounts, provided accounts are
independently controlled and firewalls are imposed between trading desks.
This would be very difficult to regulate, and provides banks with a set of
loopholes big enough to drive a Wall Street bailout or bonus through.
Traders who exceed futures limits would also be
able to use swaps (derivatives that allows parties to exchange benefits of
their respective financial instruments) to reduce their net position.
Asleep at the Wheel?
Lets see whos driving...
Still, it should come as no real surprise that the limits being toyed with
by the CFTC
fail to address the problem of excessive speculation.
CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler himself spent
18 years at Goldman Sachs, had made partner by the time he was 30, and
eventually became the companys co-head of finance. He subsequently worked
as the undersecretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department during
the Clinton era, during which time he advocated the passage of the CFMA
mentioned above.
Commissioner Jill E Sommers also worked
closely with congressional staff on the drafting of the CFMA, while another
Comissioner, Scott D OMalia, lobbied for the repeal of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act, legislation that was directed at curbing
speculation by energy and water utilities.
These viewpoints dominate the CFTC, and they represent the extent of
regulatory capture that the finance industry holds over Washington.
In light
of this, it is little wonder that the proposed limits leaked from the CFTC
do little to rein in excessive speculation. Added to this is the fact that
the CFTCs funding hangs in the balance.
While the Senate Appropriations Committee
recently approved a bill raising the CFTC budget (from $202 million to $240
million for 2012), it is unclear how this will be reconciled with a House
bill that cuts the CFTCs funding to $171.9 million.
Still, all is not lost. Within the CFTC, the other camp is headed by
Commissioner Bart Chilton, a vocal supporter of position limits, who
has spoken out strongly against speculation in commodity markets, especially
the silver market (in late 2010 he revealed that a single trader controlled
40% of the market).
Anti-Excessive
Speculation Act 2011
More promising is the Anti-Excessive Speculation Act of 2011, intended to,
prevent excessive speculation in commodity
markets and excessive speculative position limits on energy
contracts...
Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida and
Representative Peter Welch introduced matching bills in late September 2011
to cap position limits at a level that reflects market fundamentals of
supply and demand.
Section 5(7) of that Act defines an excessive speculative position as a
position that affects,
more than 5 percent of the estimated deliverable
supply of the same commodity,
...a drastic reduction on the amount of a
commodity than can be gambled on than under either the present scenario or
the leaked regulations from the CFTC.
While a number of Democrats support the
initiative, the massive support the Democratic Party has received from the
finance industry would likely mitigate its passage in the Senate, or in the
Republican-led House of Representatives for that matter. Indeed, it is would
be unlikely that Congress would bother intervening while the CFTC, a
supposedly expert, non-partisan body, is still busy delaying in this area.
And all the while as Washington and Wall Street bounce back and forth on
this issue, commodity prices hover just below their all-time high and over a
billion people continue to starve.
While the zombie bankers and blood-sucking speculators mightnt realize it,
food is a human right, and we need to recognize that the rights of humanity
are far too important to be left to the market.
