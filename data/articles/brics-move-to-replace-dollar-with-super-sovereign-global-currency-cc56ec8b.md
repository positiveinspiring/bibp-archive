Move To Replace Dollar With
Chinese Denominated
Single Super-Sovereign Global
Currency
As China is expected to rise to the status of a
financial superpower within the next 8 years and eclipse the US economy by
2020, Africa becomes center stage in the greatest currency war the world has
seen since the 1930s, which is now shifting into overdrive.
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, collectively known as
the BRICS nations, are moving forward with their plan to unseat the US dollar
from its throne as the global trade currency and to replace it with a
Chinese-denominated super-sovereign international currency.
This Geo-political game to establish global monetary dominance is by no
means limited to the attack on the US dollar. Instead this is merely the
first strike of a concerted campaign of worldwide economic warfare that will
soon follow which seeks to bring the United States and its western allies to
their knees.
Ultimately the BRICS collective is staging a coup to overthrow the current
global financial regime that has been dominated by the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund since the last global currency war was won at
the end of World War II.
The attack comes partially in retaliation for the latest round of
quantitative easing in which we witnessed
the Federal Reserve deliberately
printing trillions of dollars in an attempt to jump-start the U.S. economy
by forcing investors back into the U.S. stock market by devaluing the US
dollar.
Of course, this came with the (un)intended consequence that devaluing the
U.S. dollar erased the profits that nations such as China would have
otherwise gained from the trillions of dollars of U.S. Treasury securities
they have purchased.
Nations have gone to war for far less than trillions of dollars of bad debt,
but at the end of the day it's less about the loss of profit on an
investment and more about the economic sovereignty of the BRICS nations
being threatened.
The devaluation of the dollar translates into real and direct economic
impacts on the economies of the BRICS nations by making their products
relativity more costly and in turn harder to sell at a lower profit margin.
Clearly devaluing the dollar forces the BRICS nations to pay the tab for the
economic and debt woes of the United States and Europe, while destroying the
economies BRICS nations in the process.
Quite frankly, the BRICS nations are pissed about all of this and China has
been the most outspoken nation about it in the past.
China has already
issued calls for international supervision over the US and
issue demands for a single global currency due the combination of the United
States debt problems and currency devaluations.
More recently attention has been placed on the
escalating trade war between
China and the United States, as the United States lives in a glass house
while throwing stones at China for being a currency manipulator.
President Obama has even hypocritically signed an executive order creating
an
Inter-agency Trade Enforcement center to make China
play by the rules.
Then there is the recent focus on the
Rare Earth Trade war.
But in the meantime very few have paid attention to Africa which has now
become ground zero for the BRICS attack to take down the global banking
cartel.
In South Africa the collective is pushing the Chinese currency,
the renminbi,
as part of a pilot program to make the currency the new standard de facto
for international trade in emerging markings, which they plan on turning
into a single super-sovereign global currency.
The hope is that this new currency will strip the global financial regime of
its power and hence relieve the United States of its role of imposing its
political and economic views on the rest of the world.
Clearly the United States is well aware of this plan and has been making
preparations to head off the attack for years through
AFRICOM.
This is obviously apparent in the
use of USAFRICOM to militarize the entire
continent of Africa to fight off Chinas imminent economic encroachment.
While we consider all of this, let us not forget that the currency war of
the 1930s ended with the greatest military war ever fought - World War II.
For more, The Daily Paul points us to an article which informs us that
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are taking the next step to
rid the world of the the US Dollar as the global trade currency.
BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa
...Move to Unseat US
Dollar as Trade Currency
South Africa will this week take some initial steps to unseat the US dollar
as the preferred worldwide currency for trade and investment in emerging
economies.
Thus, the nation is expected to become party to endorsing the Chinese
currency, the renminbi, as the currency of trade in emerging markets.
This means getting a renminbi-denominated bank account, in addition to a
dollar account, could be an advantage for African businesses that seek to do
business in the emerging markets.
The move is set to challenge the supremacy of the US dollar. This, experts
say, is the latest salvo in the greatest worldwide currency war since the
1930s.

The post cites the following City Press Article which explains how the world
is currently in the midst of the greatest currency war since the 1930s.
It then goes onto explain how the move to unseat the dollar is part of the
BRICS plan to create a super-sovereign international reserve currency and
overthrow the current global financial regime.

The move is set to challenge the supremacy of the US dollar. This, experts
say, is the latest salvo in the greatest worldwide currency war since the
1930s.
In the 1930s, several nations competitively devalued their currencies to
give their domestic economies an advantage over others.
And this led to a worldwide decline in overall trade volumes at the time.
The north will be pitted against the entire south in a historic competitive
currency battle - whose terrain has moved to the Indian capital New Delhi - where the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations will
assemble next week.
China seeks to find new markets for its currency and to lobby to
internationalize it throughout the Brics states.
For China this is not a new game. In 2009, senior Chinese banking officials
issued a statement that the international monetary system was flawed owing
to an unhealthy dependence on the US dollar and called for a
'super-sovereign' international reserve currency.
Experts say Beijings first step is to internationalize its currency (by
expanding its reach beyond China), liberalize it (to allow its value to be
determined by the market instead of actively managing it as they currently
do) and then make it a reserve currency for many nations in the developing
world.
Africas largest bank, Standard Bank, says in a research document:
'We
expect at least $100bn (about R768bn) in Sino-African trade - more than the
total bilateral trade between China and Africa in 2010 - to be settled in
the renminbi by 2015.'
[...]
Not only will the US dollar be challenged, but also the entire international
financial regime - led by
the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund
- which has been dominant since the end of World War II.
[...]
The demand for greater political say in international affairs dovetails with
Chinas expected rise as a financial superpower in the next eight years.
Vargas showed the preparatory meeting projections indicating that Chinas
economy will have eclipsed that of the US by 2020, hence the promotion of
the renminbi as the preferred currency of the south.
The renminbi has traditionally traded at a deliberately lower exchange rate,
which gave a huge boost to Chinas domestic economic sectors and enabled its
booming industrialization and growth.
The US and other trading partners have long accused China of being a
'currency manipulator'.
Last week, Brazil declared its commitment to keep its own currency
- the
real - low. Its Finance Minister, Guido Mantega, reiterated his November
2010 declaration that a global currency war has broken out.
He said:
'We do not want to lose our manufacturing sector. We will not sit back and watch while other countries devalue their
currencies.'
Brazil and China cried foul last year when, through a slew of initiatives
dubbed QE2 - quantitative easing Two - the US indirectly devalued its
currency by pumping about $600bn into its economy to protect the economy
from sliding back into recession.
