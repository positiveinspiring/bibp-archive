When is a whistleblower not a whistleblower?
When he's a scapegoat.
Pfc.
Bradley Manning is an unfortunate -
and challenging - case in point, and to understand why, we need to see his
situation in context.
The military and large corporations - two institutions that play defining
roles in our industrial civilization - tend to drape themselves in the legal
fiction that a person can pass his or her responsibility off on others. In
the military, the concept of "just following orders" is still invoked,
though it was discredited by the Nuremberg trials.
In traditional corporations with publicly traded
exposure, not only are employees required to follow a similar chain of
command, but shareholders invest capacity into the entity without being
legally accountable for any misdeeds it carries out in the course of its
activities.
The equivalent of "Inc." in German, "GmbH," stands for "group
with limited responsibility."
But we lose something of ourselves, something
essentially human, when we give away responsibility for our own actions - or
think we can. In our case, we now have a bizarre situation in which
corporations are considered "legal persons" while actual persons are
deprived of their humanity by an established fiction!
The possibilities for abuse are endless.
The need for this legerdemain is inherent in the purposes of these two
institutions. The military, tasked with carrying out society's "legitimate"
violence, and the corporation, designed to generate material profits, need
to pretend that they can reassign responsibility, since one cannot make
oneself an instrument of violence and/or greed without committing misdeeds,
whether or not they are recognized as such in law.
I am not saying that this is all that
corporations, or even, I suppose, the military, do, but they do enough of it
to constitute dangers that we have to address, and the fiction of
transferred responsibility prevents us from addressing them. If these two
institutions cannot operate without this legal fiction and all the violence
that fiction enables, we may have to find entirely different ways of doing
business and defense.
To be sure, the need for this pretense says something positive about human
nature.
It is like the phenomenon that psychologist
Rachel MacNair calls perpetration-induced traumatic stress, the
phenomenon that is tormenting so many troops who are returning from Iraq and
Afghanistan only to commit suicide at home.
As David Swanson recently wrote in "War
is a Lie," those,
"who survive war are far more likely now to
have been trained and conditioned to do things they cannot live with
having done."
But neither that remorse nor the legal fiction
that they were not responsible for what they did can, by themselves, save
the soldiers or the society they serve.
We have to learn the lesson of that remorse and
that need to dissemble. We have to realize that they are telling us to find
alternatives to the abusive systems that caused them - alternatives like
nonviolent defense, needs-based rather than consumption-oriented economies
and so forth.
It may seem absurd to us that the sins of a
community could be loaded onto a goat and driven out into the wilderness,
but the Israelites needed to believe it, and so they did.
No doubt the idea that a close subordinate can
be designated to "take the heat" or be "thrown under the bus" whenever a
president is caught doing certain types of misdeeds (the particular types
that matter can vary erratically - this is how
Bill Clinton was hung for
doing something that had been passed over in silence since the beginning of
the republic) will be just as absurd to future, hopefully more enlightened,
generations.
Rene Girard has devoted his career to exposing the dynamic of
scapegoating:
its dire presence in many cultural forms
from antiquity onwards (or much earlier, if you look at some primate
behaviors), the characteristic signs of the designated scapegoat (they
turn out to be remarkably uniform across many cultures - incest or other
sexual irregularities show up everywhere) and how, as civilization
progresses, institutions like law and monotheistic belief systems were
created as, among other things, attempts to replace the scapegoat
response.
He notes that in Jewish law, for example, if a
person is accused by everyone in the community he must be set free.
This counterintuitive prescription was
introduced because "unanimous violence" is a telltale sign that what's going
on is scapegoating, and it is better to let a few guilty ones go free than
give rein to a system that destroys so many innocents - to so little good.
For scapegoating at best can defuse or deflect violence without resolving
it. In itself, it can at best bring some conflicts to a stalemate while
dangerously inflaming others. It can never bring peace. It is time to move
on.
If Girard's historical reconstruction and interpretation of
Judeo-Christian experiences is correct, it has been time for two thousand
years.
The reason modern examples of scapegoating have
been so violently destructive on such a huge scale (think of
the Holocaust)
is precisely that they belong to a bygone era and should have been outgrown
long before.
(The very term "holocaust" comes from the ancient Greek word
for the kind of sacrifice in which the victim is completely consumed by fire
- if you believe it, dedicated to the gods.)
One of Girard's more brilliant discoveries was that to maintain the fiction
of its efficacy, the scapegoating system must conceal the inconvenient fact
that the victim had nothing to do with the problem.
Scapegoat literature never allows the victim to
speak, unless it puts convenient confessions of guilt into their mouth, as
in the case of Sophocles' Oedipus, who not only admits that he is guilty of
incest but punishes and expels himself so that the community is spared the
trouble - and the pollution that can accrue to sacrificers.
You could not ask for a "better" victim. Job, on
the other hand, introduces a new moral era. When he refuses, in the text we
now have, to admit that he is guilty because he in fact isn't, he breaks the
cycle, and God responds entirely differently than the pagan
consumer-gods who "accept" the sacrifice.
This is now the critical point: do we? Do we know what we are doing when we
let military "justice" subject Manning to the inhumane punishment of
solitary confinement - the equivalent of expulsion from the land of the
living - for almost a year now, on the grounds of "prevention of injury" for
which there is no psychiatric justification?
Manning's attorney David E. Coombs,
writing in
The Washington Post on January 21, said,
"The fact that they won't articulate any
basis for it leaves you with no other conclusion than it must be
punitive"... or that no articulate basis is needed when your thinking is
not really legal, but mythic.
There is such a thing as moral progress.
That is why the suicide rate among combatants
has steadily increased with Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan - because the
moral awareness that war is a very wrong thing to do is increasing.
As the social evangelist Kirby Page said
in the simplest terms at the beginning of the last century,
"War is a sin. It is the greatest social sin
we are responsible for."
Our refusal to come to use that awareness
becomes steadily more problematic, throwing us back onto progressively more
outmoded forms of coping. War is becoming an outdated institution. So is
scapegoating. The more outdated, the more destructive they become.
Some praise the likes of Manning and
Julian Assange for their
courage, while others hate and fear them. Both reactions are understandable.
But if, as a society, we scapegoat them, we are
only trying to shift our own burden of guilt onto their shoulders, and to
think we can get away with that for very long is a dangerous delusion.
