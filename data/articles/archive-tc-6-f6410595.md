This Awareness indicates that the trees are having what may be
termed a kind of blind awareness of each other, whereby they know of
each other's presence, even without having eyes to see, or ears to
hear. This Awareness indicates it is similar to entities who, in a
dark room, without being able to hear, wherein each is totally
quiet, entities may still perceive the presence of another being.
This Awareness indicates that trees have this same extrasensory
perception, whereby they are aware of each other, and also are aware
of other beings in their presence, such as an intruding hunter or
forester.
This Awareness indicates that trees stand for many years, sometimes
for centuries in the same place. Their lives are essentially slow,
quiet, peaceful and dull. This Awareness indicates that their
experiences are few and far between. This Awareness indicates that
the most exciting experience a tree can expect to have is a storm,
wherein the winds blow the limbs violently.
This Awareness indicates
that trees love these storms, for it wakens them to their own living
self. This Awareness indicates that another experience which trees
enjoy is that of a soft breeze blowing through the branches of one
tree, carrying the scent or energies, the pollen or other chemicals
and substances from a nearby tree, to this tree.
This Awareness indicates that trees also enjoy little boys and girls
who climb on them. This Awareness indicates that trees essentially
enjoy stimulation, but they do not enjoy being cut down, although it
is not a great traumatic experience to them. This Awareness
indicates that the attitude of those who cut the tree as that which
determines the extent of the trauma which the tree would experience.
This Awareness indicates for example, a tree being cut for
Christmas, wherein entities look at the tree and love the tree, and
want to take the tree home; this tree actually enjoys the experience
and feeling of being involved in those festive energies.
This Awareness indicates that as its energies begin to fade, the
tree slowly loses its concept of self and eventually diminishes as a
being. This Awareness indicates that a raging forest fire passing
through forests is that which creates great anticipation in a nearby
tree. The tree knows of the fire long before it approaches. The tree
feels the anguish of other trees as this fire approaches and burns
them.
This Awareness indicates that the tree however, accepts this
as part of its existence, knowing that it has a long life, but that
even its long life must eventually end, and this slumber of being a
tree, the peace of being left silently alone as that which must come
to an end.
This Awareness indicates that when the energies of the tree are
freed, it may move on into other directions. Generally these
energies will go into other plants, or into animals or into people
as emotions.
This Awareness indicates that these energies are
essentially magnetic, psychic-magnetic energies which are capable of
remaining intact, though moving from place to place, and as a kind
of psychic-magnetic force, the energies of a tree or plant may move
from being to being. The entity who eats the tomato, or the fruit of
a tree is the entity who absorbs the essence, the psychic-magnetic
energy of that plant.
This Awareness indicates that once this energy is absorbed, much of
it remains with the entity for a period, and a portion will always
remain, even though it diminishes as time passes. This Awareness
indicates this is similar to the concept of a sound which never
ceases to be, even though the human ear can no longer hear it.
This
Awareness indicates that the chemicals which... The essences which
trees give off to other trees as warnings of that which is
occurring, do help to trigger protective mechanisms within the tree,
so that the tree under attack can exert certain chemical reactions
in its leaves and bark, whereby it serves as a protection against
many of the attacking insects.
This Awareness indicates that a tree
is not designed, in most cases, to protect itself from extremely
harsh and violent chemicals, such as herbicides, or certain types of
fungus which may attack in such quantities as to destroy the tree.
This Awareness indicate that however, it is capable of protecting
itself to some degree against natural forces such as the attacks by
insects, particularly those trees which have developed certain types
of immunity systems whereby they may insert energies into their
leaves or branches that will serve as a poisoning mechanism to those
insects.
This Awareness indicates that this depends on the species
of trees and the species on insects involved, as to the
effectiveness of their defense mechanism.
