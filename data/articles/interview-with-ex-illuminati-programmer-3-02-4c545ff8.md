Q: Can the Illuminatis family trees be traced back to specific
towns in Europe?
A: Yes, and this depends on the branch. There is the
German branch,
the French branch, the UK branch, and the Russian branch. Each has
roots in different areas of Europe. The towns of central Germany and
Austria were the beginning for the German branch. They trace their
roots from the Knights Templar who united the European nations
during the crusades.
Q: Do they consider the
Christian God real, but a liar?
A: The
Illuminati believe in the deification of men through
knowledge. They know that there are supernatural beings who help
them in this process, but they dont necessarily divide things into
"good and bad", rather "enlightened" or "unenlightened". They
believe that the Christian God is real, but that adherents of
Christianity are one step short of enlightenment, that they do not
know the "full picture" as they do. They see Christians as sheep who
follow a nice story created to help them feel better, because they
are "too weak" to want to know the "full truth". (This is what an
illuminist would say in describing the difference). They tend to be
cynical towards the Christian God, to see him as a placebo for the
weak.
Q: Do they consider their own god a liar, even if for "good"? If so,
how do they trust their god?
A: They do not consider their gods (they have several) as liars.
These "gods" have given them power, wealth, status, and everything
that they have asked for. Yes, at a price, a horrible price, but
they believe that nothing comes cheaply, and the higher the price
they have paid, the more they value the gift. It is hard to explain
this type to thinking to someone outside the group, because
mainstream society wants to see them as evil Satanists, and opposed
to Christianity. They themselves wouldnt put it quite that way. Oh,
they will mock and downgrade Christianity, but only because they
want its followers to see that they are the deceived ones". The god
of this world has truly blinded their eyes. Do they "trust" their
gods? As much as they trust anything. Remember, trust is not a
concept in this group, where "betrayal is the greatest good" is a
maxim taught since childhood. If you asked them, do you "trust" your
deity, they would look puzzled, and say, "only a foolish person
trusts what they cannot know" or some other maxim.
Q: Do they consider the
Christian God to be a God of naive love?
A: Yes, yes, very naive, and setting His followers up for a fall.
This is the extent of their arrogance.
Q: If they use torture and terror on those they love who are of
lower rank, how do they distinguish between love and hate?
A: They dont. They tell their children as they are torturing them,
"I am doing this because I love you." To them, the greatest love is
to make a child strong, and fit to lead or to move higher in the
group, by whatever means it takes.
If a leader sees a child, and wants it as a prostitute, the loving
parents will give it away, happy that their child will rise in
status. Also, again, they view betrayal as the greatest good. They
will do set up after set up to teach their children to never openly
trust others.
I remember hundreds of agonizing set ups and betrayals, and hearing
when I was betrayed or wounded, "And such is the heart of man."
Those doing this to me thought they were teaching me something of
value, that would help me. And because of the vicious and political
nature of the group, in one sense they were right; the naive get
stepped on and wounded. I have known parents who tried to spare
their children some of this out of love, but often they were
overruled by other family members, who viewed these parents as
"weak" and "unfit" to teach their child.
Q: Can you list their religious beliefs in some detail? e.g.
re-incarnation? Heaven and hell? Sin? Absolution? Elves?
A: Which part? Spiritual has many branches, including:
A child will have to learn each
of these disciplines, and others, as part of their training. They
also have theta, or psychic training, as well.
The Illuminati have taken the best (or worst) of each of these
religions, and incorporated them. Also, there is NOT just ONE
religion that every group follows. In Washington DC, my main
trainers were Celtic druids and adherents of Babylonian mystery
religion. In San Diego, the Egyptian mystery religion is emphasized,
in part because Col. Aquinos oversees that group, and is heavily
into Temple of Set.
Here is a brief overview, doing my best to incorporate these
beliefs. They believe that reincarnation is possible, because of the
time travel that they do, but they dont emphasize it in their
teachings. They believe in a final sphere of white light, which to
them is total enlightenment, and their concept of heaven. They
believe that they are immune from hell, which is for the
unenlightened. Their concept of hell is different than the Bibles;
they believe that it means being lower and never reaching higher in
the afterlife (they believe there are levels there, too, determined
by how one progresses here on earth).
To them, sin is being weak or stupid, and not using the intelligence
or abilities you were given, or failing to progress. I never heard
any discussion of absolution. If you fail, you are punished or
killed. That simple. There is some belief in elves, sprites, and
other small beings in the druidic branch, who also see life in each
of natures creations.
Q: Some researchers claim that various items that people are
commonly exposed to in society are part of the means to weaken their
enemies. Therefore, I wonder if the Illuminati allow their own
leading members to be exposed to these, i.e. the following:
a. chlorine and
fluoride in water and foods
b. vaccines
c.
medical drugs
d. junk food
e.
micro-waved food
f. dietary supplements
g.
biochips
h. mercury fillings
i.
HAARP
j. Chemtrails
A: In general, true leadership is protected from much of the above.
They are ORDERED to not: drink, do drugs, or anything harmful to
themselves. They dont go as far as junk food or micro-waved food,
since they dont worry about that, but at meetings, healthy food
such as granola or trail mix are given out during exercises, and
they know the importance of good nutrition.
They will NOT put their top leaders through the extensive use of
mind control experimentation, or implants, etc. because of the risk
involved. These children and adults ARE dissociative, but they go
through a special program that is different than for the lower
levels. They do get vaccines, since even if the child became ill, a
healer could fix them. And they do take medications if needed, such
as antibiotics, etc.
Do they claim to use vaccines or medical drugs for genocide? I had
not heard that when I was in the group. Everyone I knew was
vaccinated and took medications, although vitamins and good diet
were also important.
Q: Some claim that Mormons,
Jehovahs Witnesses,
Charismatics,
Pagans, the New Age Movement, Satanists, etc. were founded by the
same plotters. Are these groups, or at least their leaders,
considered allies of the Illuminati by their members?
A: Some of these groups have affiliated themselves secretly with
the
Illuminati (because of the money and free training offered), others
are sympathetic, or at the least, respectful of them. The Mormons
affiliated years ago in a meeting with Illuminati leadership in the
1950s. The same with the Jehovahs Witnesses. I have not heard that
Charismatics or Pagans were affiliated, the pagans are considered
"dabblers" by the Illuminati. The New Age and
Satanists are
sympathetic to them.
Q: Do they respect real science or history in favor of "faith" in
their own beliefs?
A: No. They will respect science, but they will try to rewrite
history in set ups and dramas for children (where they purport to
show them "real history" behind the scenes). Also, they will do time
travel through portals, but I cannot say how accurate what occurs
is, since I believe it is facilitated demonically.
The Illuminati teach their children that powerful occultists who
were enlightened have been secretly behind the thrones of Europe,
and down the ages behind the kingdoms of this world, since time
began. True or propaganda? I dont know. They teach their children
that underneath Stonehenge there is a great room filled with the
skeletons of sacrifices. Fact or fiction? I dont know, and cannot
fund the archeological expedition it would take to verify this or
not.
How accurate their teachings are, I do question, since they also
leave out the role of faith in God, and His ability to hold back
evil. I believe that ultimately, God has been in control of human
history, not evil.
