Well, it's nice work if you can get it. Florida
is set to privatize all of its prisons south of Orlando - 20% of its total -
according to
a report issued by Chris Kirkham for Huffington Post.
Getting rich off taxpayers by
building cages
The for-profit prison scheme is a case study in
crony capitalism, as it involves private prison corporations donating to the
politicians best in position to grant them lucrative contracts.
Cenk Uygur,
in the video below, breaks down this "cherry picking" strategy that sets up
FL taxpayers to carry the burden of failure, while corporate/government
interests land another windfall; in this case, the largest procurement
contract in the industry's history:
Beyond this single blatant example of lobbying by private interests in the
state of Florida, the trend of privatizing prisons has been ongoing since
the first business was established in 1984,* (1984...???) and is slated to rise in coming
years.
* Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) was awarded a contract to take
over a facility in Hamilton County, Tennessee. This marked the first time
that any government in the country had contracted out the complete operation
of a jail to a private operator. (Source)
Furthermore, the implications of what it means that private companies
are taking over captive populations should also be examined.
The U.S. prison population continues to explode, as America plunges headlong
into becoming a bona fide police state. The federal policies of
criminalizing just about everything, offer a built-in growth sector for any
corporation that can capture it. No wonder, then, that companies like GE
have gotten in on the action, while the nation's largest private
contractors, Corrections Corporation of America and GEO (formerly
Wackenhut), have combined revenues well into the billion of dollars per
year. And they are international in scope.

America already holds 25% of the world's prison population, and the number
of these prisoners held in private prisons has risen dramatically over the
past 10 years from 2,000 housed in 5 private prisons, to more than 60,000
housed in 100; and is a number expected to rise to 360,000 prisoners over
the next decade.

Logically, such growth would only encourage the same collusion and
revolving-door policies that we see in the weapons and security industries,
for example, where government officials who craft legislation and award
contracts end up working for, or heading up, private companies that are
well-positioned to reap the rewards.

This strategy has even found its way into immigration policy, as it has been
revealed that the private prison industry helped to draft Arizona's
immigration law.
SB1070 was created in a hand-holding session between
Corrections Corporation of America and State Senator Russell Pearce in
another blatant example of corporatism.
This should anger those on either
side of the immigration debate, as it completely excluded the voting public:
According to Corrections Corporation of America reports reviewed by NPR,
executives believe immigrant detention is their next big market. Last year,
they wrote that they expect to bring in 'a significant portion of our
revenues' from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that detains
illegal immigrants.

The "next big market" is something that is normally reserved for a new
product designed to be desirable to its target audience, whether through
novelty or efficiency.
Turning human beings into that product is nothing
short of a type of human trafficking and slavery, as discussed in the video
below:
As the economy declines, there has even been a revival in
debtors' prisons,
formally abolished in the early 1800s.
Perhaps this is the crux of the
message: real pressure is mounting on local governments to trim costs in a
difficult economic environment. An empathetic public is primed to be swayed
by that argument. However, Kirkham clearly demonstrates in his article that
even this reasoning is completely fallacious:
Proponents have advanced the move as a cost-saving measure, a
business-minded response to the state's budget shortfall.
But a series of
studies and the experiences of several other states that have experimented
with privatizing prison systems raise significant doubts about the cost
savings that are supposed to accrue: Private prisons have tended to take
control of the lowest-cost inmates, those lacking health problems and posing
less risk of violence, while leaving states to contend with the harder
cases.

Perhaps most worrisome about the growth of private control over an
increasing "human product" cherry picked from the public is that it seems to
be
no longer reserved only for adults.
A heightening wave of arresting
children, some
as young as five, might be tempting to corporate interests
that have proven themselves to be more than happy to expand their product
line and reap profits... even from the most innocent among us.
