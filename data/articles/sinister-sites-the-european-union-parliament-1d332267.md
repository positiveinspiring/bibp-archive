Ever since its completion on December 14 1999,
the EU parliament has raised eyebrows and questions regarding its structure.
The main tower, called the Louise Weiss building, looks peculiar and
modernist.
Why does it look unfinished?
Promoters say it reflects the unfinished nature
of Europe. However, some research on the subject reveals the dark and deep
symbolism of the building. Exposing the real source of inspiration behind
the Louise Weiss building is exposing the esoteric beliefs of the world
elite, their dark aspirations and their interpretation of ancient
scriptures.
Well go straight to the point: the Louise Weiss building is meant to look
like painting The Tower of Babel by Pieter Brueghel the Elder in 1563.
Story says that the Tower of Babel was never completed.
So, the UN Parliament is basically continuing
the unfinished work of Nimrod, the infamous tyrant, who was building the
Tower of Babel to defy God.
Do you think this is a good source of
inspiration for a democratic institution?
Nimrod and the Tower
of Babel
The story of
Nimrod and the
Tower of Babel
appears in numerous texts of ancient cultures including Hebrew, Islamic,
Greek and Kabbalah.
Nimrod is said to be the founder and the the
king of the first empire after the Flood. His realm includes Babylon
(Babel), Uruk, Akkad and Calneh. He is known to be a king that brought
tyranny to the people while seeking to eliminate religious beliefs.
"Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such
an affront and contempt of God. He was the grandson of Ham, the
son of Noah, a bold man, and of great strength of hand. He persuaded
them not to ascribe it to God, as if it were through his means they were
happy, but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that
happiness.
He also gradually changed the government
into tyranny, seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God,
but to bring them into a constant dependence on his power
Now the
multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod, and to
esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God"
According to biblical accounts, Babel was city
that united humanity, all speaking a single language and migrating from the
East.
It was the home city of Nimrod. He decided that the city should have a
tower so immense that its top should be in the heavens. That tower was
however not for worship and praise of God, but was dedicated to the glory of
man with a motive of making a name for the builders.
The Midrash version
of the story even adds that the builders of the Tower said:
God has no right to choose the upper world
for Himself, and to leave the lower world to us; therefore we will build
us a tower, with an idol on the top holding a sword, so that it may
appear as if we intended to war with God".
God, seeing the blasphemous nature of the Tower,
gave each person a different language to confuse them.
Unable to continue
the work, the people scattered throughout the world.
Symbolism of the EU
Parliament
So the construction of the EU Parliament in the image of the Tower of Babel
sends the message that Nimrod had the right philosophy and his Tower of
Babel was a good idea.
So we are looking for:
-
A gradual introduction of tyranny
-
The elimination of the worship of God to
introduce dependence on power
-
All people speaking the same language
and the same religion
-
Rejecting God while trying to become
Gods
You know what? Those are major precepts of the
esoteric beliefs of the world elite. Their belief system is based on the
Mystery Religions (pagan rituals, worship of the Sun, considering Lucifer as
the one who gave light to the human race, seeing God as a force wanting to
keep humans in the dark).
Their
New World Order will have evacuated all
worship of God, introduced a single language and changed democracy to
tyranny.
The Banned Poster
Do I sound a little out there? Did I read too much into this building?
Answer is: NO.
Here is the OFFICIAL poster promoting the EU
Parliament:
We see the people of Europe rebuilding the
Tower of Babel.
Heres some points to note:
-
First, we have a confirmation that the
Louise Weiss building was truly inspired by the
Tower of Babel. The poster
recreated the exact tower on Pieter Brueghels painting, even making
sure to include the broken part of the foundation. There is NO
question there.
-
Second, the slogan: Europe: Many
Tongues One Voice refers to God confusing the people with many
languages.
-
Third, look closely at the stars at the
top. Do they look strange? They are upside down aka reversed
pentagrams.
The symbolism behind pentagrams is extremely
deep and complex but we can say that a regular pentagram refers to Good
Ruling and a reverse pentagram refers to Evil Ruling.
This poster has been banned due to protests by
numerous groups. It is however extremely revealing and proves the esoteric
mindset of the builders of the European Unions Parliament.
The Abduction of
Europa
This statue, standing in front of the Winston
Churchill building, refers to ancient mythology and depicts one the most
ancient representation of Europe.
Its based on a story where Zeus disguised
himself as a white bull in order to seduce the princess Europa who was
gathering flowers. When she approached the bull and got on its back, the
bull seized the occasion to run away with her and eventually rape her (Im
giving you the non-censored version of the story).
So the woman (who represents Europe) on top of this bull is about to get
raped. OK, weird. Anyways, it represents Good vs Evil, Sun vs Moon
and all of that. An integral part of the Mystery Religions.
Learn about this.
To conclude
The European Union is a superstate that currently includes 27 countries
(more in the future).
The same faith awaits American and Asian
countries, who are bound to unite under the same flag and currency to create
other superstates. Those are the building blocks towards a Single World
Government, a goal actively sought by the world elite.
The EU Parliament is the first monument
representing a superstate and reveals, through its intense symbolism, hatred
of religion, plans for a
New World Order and their subtle
endorsement of tyranny.
