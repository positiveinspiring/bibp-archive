It appears that President Lula of Brazil has
decided to shine some light on the
Obama administration's
machinations on
Iran.
He has finally released the full text of Obama's 20th April letter to
Brazil about the proposed TTR fuel swap deal and
the entire thing appears
today in Brazilian Foreign Policy.
The letter reads, in part:
The letter also specifically mentions the
compromise of using Turkey as the location for Iran's fuel to be held "in
escrow".
I would urge Brazil to impress upon Iran the opportunity presented by this
offer to "escrow" its uranium in Turkey while the nuclear fuel is being
produced.
This letter's authenticity is not disputed by the White House.
It exposes
the Obama administration's forked-tongue response to the Brazil and Turkey
brokered swap. The White House is now in full spin mode, but the spin has
already been undercut by the release of the letter's full text.
Of late,
Hilary Clinton has been the main vehicle for the White House's double-talk,
which is now entirely aimed at closing down opportunities to find a
negotiated settlement to the Iran nuclear issue no matter what the new
National Security Strategy might say.
But Obama must also bear the burden of blame,
his is the desk where the buck stops.
