Deleveraging"

One of the populist buzzwords of the past 5
years, particularly in Europe, has been "austerity".
As we have said for the roughly the same past 5
years, is simply a synonym for "deleveraging"
but one which carries just the right amount of negative connotations, and is
used by crafty politicians to shift blame from their own failure to enact
proper policy (which over the past 30 years has merely meant to borrow
growth from future political cycles, aka, issue debt) onto a "technical"
word conceived by Ph.D.-clad economists, who too, are looking for a passive
victim on which to project their failure of enacting a voodoo economic
theory.
There is one problem with all of the above. As
we have also been saying for the past five years, the
austerity deleveraging
myth is one big lie.
We are setting the record straight below with
facts and figures.
We would be delighted if some politician, somewhere,
could disprove these facts, which essentially imply that the world is now in
a global recession, having experienced no growth as the recent 100% contractionary PMI print of all major economies confirms, yet without any
country actually having implemented austerity, pardon deleveraging to have
at least a modest justification for this failure of growth.
Finally, this article proves that the European
chorus screaming for "growth" when everyone knows it demands merely more of
the same drug - debt - is 100% wrong, and that while the underlying
causes of "growth" are there, the only thing missing are the symptoms.
DB's Jim Reid provides the charts and
facts:
Figure 37 shows the combined Debt to GDP of the
EU-12 (excluding Luxembourg), the U.S., UK, Japan and Australia.
This debt includes Governments, Financials,
Corporates and Households. Irelands small economy and large financial
system (domestic and foreign), ensures an outsized reading which we cut off
in the chart.
Figure 38 then shows:
-
how this ratio has changed from the end
of 2007 to the end of 2011
-
what the trend was in the 1-year to the
end of 2011 to see momentum
-
where the ratio is from the peak point
The data is represented in percentage point
moves.
As can be seen, only the U.S. and Australia have
seen their overall economy Debt to GDP fall since the end of 2007 and for
both these the fall is negligible.
The U.S. has gone from around 348% to 345% on
this measure. From the peak the U.S. has fallen from the 366% seen in 2009
and the 353% seen in 2010 but few other countries are seeing their debt/gdp
ratio move in the right direction.
Many are currently at their peak overall
economy wide leverage number and as already discussed when looked at from
the start of the crisis all but the U.S. and Australia have seen this ratio
rise. Interestingly as well see below Australia and the U.S. have still
seen debt rise but Nominal GDP has risen by a higher amount, thus helping
them see leverage ratios decline slightly.
It shows how important growth and inflation are
if you want to delever.
Deleveraging problems
from both the debt and growth side
The deleveraging problem comes from both sides.
As we saw in Figure 36 in the previous section,
growth has struggled to eclipse its peak levels across a number of countries
with only inflation allowing many to surpass their peak activity levels. In
terms of debt, Figure 39 shows the growth of an index of economy wide
liabilities from our DW sample rebased at 100 at the end of 2007.
We have gone back as far as the full data starts
for each country.
Figure 40 then shows a simple un-weighted
average and median of this basket and shows that debt is still increasing in
the developed world.
Figure 41 then looks at the numbers for each
country again from the end of 2007 to Q1 2012, since the end of 2010 and
also from the peak.
Debt hasn't started to turn down anywhere in the
Developed World since the end of 2007. As already discussed, those that have
seen their debt/GDP ratios stabilize (e.g. U.S. and Australia) have required
some nominal GDP growth.
So debt is still climbing in most countries.
Clearly the splits are changing with more
emphasis on public over private debt but there's little evidence that the DM
deleveraging trend has started yet.
Given such an unparalleled run up in debt over
the last few years and decades, will we be able to de-lever naturally and
without defaults? If we can find a higher pace of growth and inflation than
debt accumulation then we can.
But can every country succeed? The reality is
that we would make a strong argument suggesting that the high debt burdens
are actually holding growth back thus ensuring a problem of circularity.
As a minimum it likely ensures that these
economies remain fragile and vulnerable to shocks for many years to come.
Note: So
in aggregate the DM post-GFC world can be characterized by a No
Growth, No Deleveraging mantra and one where we are still in a
similar situation to where we were five years ago.
