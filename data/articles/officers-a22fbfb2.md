The Asia
Foundation
http://www.asiafoundation.org/
“Utilizing its 47-year presence throughout Asia, The Asia Foundation collaborates with partners from the public and private sectors to build leadership, improve policy and regulation, and strengthen institutions to foster greater openness and shared prosperity in the Asia Pacific region.”
http://www.asiafoundation.org/about/abou_over.html
The curious
beginnings of “The Asia Foundation” are just coming out with the release of LBJ
Presidential documents. For example, this memo from June 22nd 1966
from the CIA to the 303 Committee:
“SUBJECT: The
Asia Foundation: Proposed Improvements in Funding
Procedures
1.
Summary
The Asia
Foundation (TAF), a Central Intelligence Agency proprietary, was established in
1954 to undertake cultural and educational activities on behalf of the United
States Government in ways not open to official U.S. agencies. Over the past
twelve years TAF has accomplished its assigned mission with increasing
effectiveness and has, in the process, become a widely-known institution, in
Asia and the United States. TAF is now experiencing inquiries regarding its
sources of funds and connections with the U.S. Government from the aggressive
leftist publication, Ramparts. It is conceivable that such inquiries will lead
to a published revelation of TAF's CIA connection. In the present climate of
national dissent and in the wake of recent critical press comment on CIA
involvement with American universities, we feel a public allegation that CIA
funds and controls TAF would be seized upon, with or without proof, and
magnified beyond its actual significance to embarrass the Administration and
U.S. national interests at home and abroad. Some immediate defensive and
remedial measures are required [2-1/2 lines of source text not
declassified].
[3 paragraphs
(11 lines of source text) not declassified]
In the long
run, we feel TAF's vulnerability to press attack can be reduced and its
viability as an instrument of U.S. foreign policy in Asia can be assured by
relieving it of its total dependence upon covert funding support from this
Agency. In the belief that TAF contributes substantially to U.S. national
interests in Asia, and can continue to contribute if its viability is sustained,
CIA requests the Committee's study and attention to possible alternative means
of supporting it.”

Former Chairman of the Board, Retired President and CEO, BankAmerica Corporation
San Francisco, California
Rudolph Peterson, BS 25, joined the banking industry when
consumer financing was a pioneering idea. He worked at Commercial Credit
Corporation, the first bank to offer automobile financing for dealer inventories
and consumer purchases, before Bank of America hired him in 1936 to start their
consumer credit business. The great success of consumer financing launched the
career of Peterson, who was named CEO and president of BankAmerica Corporation
in 1961. A loyal alumnus, Peterson was Cal’s 1967 Alumnus of the Year and
received the Chancellor’s Award in 1991. His 1997 gift endowed the school’s
Peterson Program in Business Ethics. (source)
He is a trustee of the Committee for Economic Development and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He was an alumni of Delta Sigma Pi fraternity and is a life trustee of the California Institute of Technology
“Forty-two years ago Bank of Hawaii was a stodgy operation
that waited for customers to bring in their money so the bank could lend it out
and make a profit. On the diagonally opposite corner at Bishop and King Streets
in the center of Honolulu its rival, Bishop National Bank, was much the
same.
Then at the end of 1955 disgruntled Bank of Hawaii directors
brought in a young, aggressive financial services man, Rudolph A. Peterson, from
the West Coast to shake things up.
Peterson began scouring for customers instead of waiting for
them to come. He began the expansion of services that culminated in last week's
name change. He also started a 39-year-long dynasty of officers with similar
philosophies. Johnson is the first CEO not from the Peterson dynasty but this
month got a letter from Peterson, now 92, and retired as Bank of America CEO,
applauding his course.
The Peterson gang plus Johnson have grown the company's assets to $14 billion compared to $8 billion for its rival, First Hawaiian, formerly Bishop, which was No. 1 in 1955. Diversification and good management made the difference, Johnson says” Honolulu Star, April 29, 1997 (this would make Rudolph now 97(!).
Indeed, in 1970 he wrote: “When I speak of the Pacific Rim, I am putting the broadest possible construction on the term–the western coasts of South America, Central America, our own continent, and extending beyond Australia and the Far East to India. There is no more vast or rich area for resource development or trade in the world today than this immense region, and it is virtually our own front yard…Were we California businessmen to play a more dynamic role in helping trade development in the Pacific Rim, we would have giant, hungry new markets for our products and vast new profit potentials for our firms.” (source)
Nixon wrote this his 1970 “The United States Foreign Policy for the 1970's Building for Peace”:
“Therefore, in 1969-after developing the principles of our overall foreign policy-I appointed a distinguished task force of experts from the business and academic communities, chaired by Mr. Rudolph Peterson, to make comprehensive and detailed recommendations on our foreign assistance programs. On the basis of their work and our subsequent analysis in the National Security Council system, I proposed a sweeping change in our foreign assistance policy in a message to Congress on September 15, 1970. “ (Chapter 11, p.3)
He gave a couple of press briefings in 1971.
We also see him turning up in these Nixon recording of August 6th, 1971, October 19th, 1971,
From 1971-1982 he was a director of the James Irvine Foundation.
From 1st January 1972 to15th January
1976, Rudolph Peterson headed the United Nations
Development Programme.
“An aging Paul Hoffman finally retired in 1971. Rudolph
Peterson, the recently retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank
of America, then the world's largest commercial bank, was the United States'
choice to head UNDP. Peterson had a reputation for "no-nonsense" toughness
and ruthlessness-qualities which had brought him to the top at the bank that he
had built into the world's largest.* He did not mask his disdain for the
backward ways of the UN nor his preconceived notions of how UNDP should be run.
Soon after his arrival, he noted that he had special experience, knowledge and
advisers on two important areas -personnel and finance- which he would apply to
UNDP. He left no doubt that there would be major changes.
Peterson, however, immediately encountered a sticky problem:
Owen had left UNDP, and there was no Deputy Administrator. C.V. Narasimhan, who
was U Thant's Chef de Cabinet and the second most powerful man in the UN
Secretariat, decided to double up as Deputy Administrator, probably to test the
waters for a possible shift to UNDP, since Thant had announced that he would
step down as Secretary-General. After an uncomfortable period, Narasimhan left
UNDP. (Ironically, Peterson himself was a part-time Administrator, retaining his
residence in San Francisco, where he continued as Chairman of the Executive
Committee of his bank.) Peterson arranged for Cohen to be appointed Deputy
Administrator, at the Under-Secretary- General level, to the consternation of
governments and the diplomatic community-since they were both US nationals, this
arrangement ran counter to the principle of geographic balance in staffing.
Cohen, however, soon retired and was given an evening farewell party in the UN
Delegates Dining Room, with the new Secretary-General, Kurt Waldheim, in
attendance.
Peterson, who had announced that he needed two deputies,
pressed for and obtained Governing Council approval. He recruited I.G. Patel of
India and Bert Lindstrom of Sweden for what he must have conceived as the
equivalent of executive vice-president posts at commercial banks. It was
probably a mistake for Peterson not to give his deputies any specific divisions
clearly reporting to them. This might work in commercial banking, but not in a
bureaucracy, where staff customarily work with clear lines of authority and neat
administrative compartments. Patel managed very well. He was a highly capable
economist, planner, economic diplomat and seasoned public servant, having been
Economic Adviser to the Planning Commission and Permanent Secretary of the
Finance Ministry of India. (He later went on to become Governor of the Reserve
Bank of India and Director of the London School of Economics.) Lindstrom, who
was from the private sector, never seemed to find his sea-legs.
The Peterson years saw the further development of country
programming, which had started during the late Hoffman years. Under Patel's
leadership, a set of "New Dimensions" was adopted. They did not sound as earth
shaking as the Capacity Study, but they introduced a new modality of government
(now "national") execution of projects. This detracted from the monopoly
hitherto enjoyed by the Agencies and gave recipient governments a greater sense
of ownership of the projects. That UNDP was able to carry it off despite the
Agencies is a tribute to Patel's diplomatic skills.
Another accomplishment of the Peterson administration was the
establishment of an "Office of Project Execution" (OPE). Peterson wanted,
rightly, to speed up project implementation. The problem was that this function
was a monopoly of the specialized agencies, which, true to monopolistic form,
were slow, inefficient, and often arrogant and uncooperative. A small in-house
executing agency was therefore established. It would implement projects rapidly,
with a minimum of red tape and through the extensive use of subcontracting to
private firms. Because of OPE's convenience, speed, and efficiency the project
officers of UNDP arranged increasingly to assign projects to OPE for
implementation. Renamed "Office of Project Services" (UNOPS), it has grown into
UNDP's largest executing agency and has also been given contracts by bilateral
assistance agencies, the World Bank, and other agencies of the UN
system.
Peterson tried unsuccessfully to introduce other organizational changes, including the splitting of the Africa Bureau in two and others intended to reduce the power base of the regional bureau heads. He also introduced private sector personnel administration methods and quickly accepted recommendations for "overprogramming" to compensate for slippage in the delivery of assistance, which proved disastrous. Partly because of communication failures, and a lack of understanding of public sector finance and personnel, Peterson failed in precisely those two areas in which he had claimed expertise: personnel and finance. After campaigning hard but unsuccessfully for a renewal of his term-he had learned to like his job- Peterson had an inglorious exit in January 1976: the UNDP Staff Council was up in arms, and UNDP was in a financial crisis.”
*On a flight from Honolulu to Fiji, shortly after Peterson's appointment, the author was seated next to a California lady journalist who told him: "So, your boss is Rudolph Peterson! Some time ago, there was a problem at the Honolulu branch of the Bank of America. A young, up-and-coming officer at the bank's headquarters in San Francisco, named Rudolph Peterson, was sent to look into the matter. And there's still blood in the streets!"
