Abstract
This report highlights a tremendous discovery of vital importance to all the
people Republic of the United States of America, and also the various
peoples of the entire world.
This discovery is presented in the form of a 51
page book which the world's people will most likely reject for the time
being, and then later at some point this report will be generally accepted
as pure factual truth as well as a massively unheeded warning.
This
information will likely be dramatically spoken of widely in the year 2011.
This
Global Elite's, the ultra-rich class, dramatic ongoing manipulation, or
manufacturing, of world history was independently discovered in mid-2005 and
published in 168 pages,
The Freemasonic Architecture of History. This more
recent freely-distributable, copyright-free, summary report (PDF) was
produced in August 2007.
This is no normal book. It is 100% unique and factual and very up to date.
It breaks free and liberates the mind from the establishment mind control
spell that most of global society has long been placed under. It reveals how
the world has long been operated as a theater, and how high level
politicians in the USA and elsewhere have been hired and placed into
position as only puppets of a secretive elite power-mad cult of
international currency, banking, & finance pirates commanding deceptively
and generationally for centuries.
I have known about this mass world governmental depravity for about 3 years.
What has been reported here together with supporting evidence presented by
others such as Mr. Alex Jones, of prisonplanet.com, does not
disappear by simply not paying attention to the problem. I tried that. I
personally lived in self-exile in Guatemala from March 2006 - July 2007. It
just doesn't work. I wish it did, but it doesn't. I wouldn't be composing
this letter and potentially putting myself in crosshairs of danger if the
global mega-problem had evaporated instead of further metathesizing.
But I think and feel: Why should I try to preserve my own little life, by
hiding like the "illuminati", the word given for the global elite class, do
- when millions, or even billions, of lives of others worldwide, potentially
hang in the balance? - (even in the light of the Biblical prophecies of
Daniel & John) Surely truth has value on its face, and the surfacing of it
may help alleviate some measure of future suffering in the world. So I do
this out of love I have for others. In the light of prophecy, I also deeply
consider Hosea 4:6, Ezekiel 33:6, and Psalms 94:16.
So denial doesn't work. I have even tried it myself once as a last resort.
Still yet today, the world just becomes more of war-zone and state of hell.
And it is rooted in people simply not understanding that all of North
America and Europe and Asia are dominated by a secret government comprised
of world elites, and those in DC and on TV are just their hired actors
carrying out their assigned scripts. (Seemingly an easy enough problem for
everyone to pitch in and help fix; potentially in less than a year's time.)
Yet it appears The People will continue to be
subjugated to the insanity of unchecked tyranny. And all the dissent and
patriotism and activism of the various people with all their many assorted
"No More War!" signs and songs will be entirely compartmentalized &
terminally suppressed; especially by the myriad of hired-to-lie "nightly
news" presstitutes and cover-up artists of today's tightly controlled
globalized mass media complex; ad-nauseam.
Tens of millions of citizens and handfuls of celebrities and even some Wall
Street brokers will just be endlessly labeled by "the president" as
"conspiracy theorists', cordoned off to their "free-speech zones", miles
away from any microphones or news cameras, and the sick & demented saga will
be allowed to continue. Metaphorically, The Emperor of the dark side, known
as "Lucifer" to the body of the United Nations and the elite, will soon have
his long scheduled Death Star completed. Amongst this group of one world
fascist revolutionaries, you'll even see the names of people such as George
Lucas, the director of movie Star Wars.
Most everyone society looks up to from Madonna to the Fed's spokesman, will
go down ultimately in world history as being members of a gigantic fraud
against the rest of humanity.
The main point of this report and book is:
Our World is Being Governed by an Orwellian
Elite-Class Administered "Cryptocracy"
From:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocracy
"Cryptocracy, from the ancient Greek (kryptos,
hidden) and (kratein, to rule), refers to a type of government where the
real leaders are hidden, or merely unknown. A puppet government or
figurehead, whether aware or not of their status as such, usually
figures into this type of government in concept. It can also be used
when referring to similar arrangements in organizations, orders, sects
and cults. As such governments are, by definition, secret."
And the proof is written right onto the DATES &
TIMES of all global terror events. (Believe it or not!)
All the major crimes of world history have all been linked together by a
distinct and distinguishable process. and this report solves all the major
crimes of world history, in one simplified analysis, through an analytical
reverse engineering of the signature 'new world order1 global takeover
process, over the last century.
Again, the definition of a Cryptocracy is a
secret government that rules by cryptic methods to obscure its existence;
thereby lending more power to them and safeguarding them as untouchables.
Their minions in the public's eyes, such as the
Fed chairman, are generally highly respected in the business world and they,
their elite puppet-masters, remain generally unknown by the majority of
society. The surnames Rothschild and Rockefeller top the secret government
org chart. They are the principle "casino owners" of the world's current
economic order. Fascinating?
Let us all hope so, because knowledge of Harry
Potter will get us all nowhere but into a relocation, "rest & relaxation",
or concentration camp. But a mass awakening or renaissance about reality may
just help preserve freedom in the world by helping to open most everyone's
eyes and mind widely. And henceforth uniting the people worldwide in a
common cause of communication, investigation, truth, love, peace, justice,
economic & political reform, and ultimately mass freedom.
This should be The People's hope.
The elite class have fashioned themselves over the course of history as
psychopathic madmen/women to the extent by conspiring together they have
repeatedly scarred the world into the giant unnecessary mess that it is
currently in. Currently the elite are buying mass acquiescence until they
can hire enough low-IQ micro-chipped soldiers to attempt to suppress any
future mass uprising against governmental tyranny.
The elite have even fooled themselves into
thinking they are doing good. They are the ones pulling the strings behind
the large-scale terrorism, the wars, the
chemtrails, the new
deadly diseases
and all the atrocities against mankind.
And they get
away with all this, mostly because most people don't think such a hidden,
yet dominating elite class, actually rules the world from behind the scenes
- contrary to what the mass media
projects to us: a media complex which artificially defines the perception
and rigid mindset that most people have of how they think the world is
(democratically??? no. demoniacally?, yes - big difference) managed.
Please examine this discovery thoroughly, and please share it with others;
or who-else will help? There is no other more concise, telling, and
foretelling assemblage of unmistakable proof of tyranny.
There will never be more of a concise analysis
or unmistakable proof provided or ever available than what is provided in
this report: barring all the global elite one day deciding to gather in one
stadium for a press conference admitting their secretive control over all
the existing puppet governments and mass media of nearly the whole world
-and begging their forgiveness from the world's people. They are likely not
going to come clean easily.
Please forward this letter to everyone in your address books. Assemble web
pages to inform others.
I, as just one person, never wanted to be a one-man-band fruitlessly sharing
this knowledge. If you will not be willing to take at least 2 hours now to
understand what is at stake for the rest of your own life, and the lives of
your children, and share this, surely everyone will regret the mass
ignorance of this warning later.
I am asking all the world's people to try and prove that:
I, all 911 truth
reporters, all the protesters of The Federal Reserve and IRS, all the
protesters of the elite sponsored implementation of the North American
Union, and all peace and anti-war activists worldwide are all nuts and still
worthy of the mass media's continued ridicule and the rest of the global
public's oversight and/or silent condemnation.

(Reminder: the overall discovery presented
by this report and all these
facts contained within, validated, and analyzed are in no wav affiliated
with or based on my personal character and personal history. I'm simply not
the world's greatest financial success story. Making sense of the world
around me has always meant more to me than making more paper money or
pocketing a Gold Card status credit card.
The trials I have been through
attempting to educate the world have pretty much completely broken me. So the vital truth that could help save everyone
a lot of chaos and
trouble in the future is now in your hands today. Only a public that is
intelligent enough to educate themselves and others has any potential
against such deceptive control tactics of the existing tyrannical world
government system.
And my advice is for you to get out of paper investments
and into silver or gold.)
A hidden form of government termed a "Cryptocracy" has
taken over America.
Get to know Aaron: Historic Interview with Aaron Russo, Fighting Cancer
and the New World Order
This book is especially dedicated to the memory of
Aaron Russo, Fighter for
American's Future Freedom. (1943-2007) Aaron passed away two days before
this information was re-published on August 25th, 2007.
Thankfully forwarded to you by a good friend through an email attachment and
presented here highlights unmistakable PROOF that a horrible DECEPTION.
rather than a democracy, has long governed America.
The American people should now unite for JUSTICE!
There is a hidden language abound in the mainstream press. This language is
a coded language of world government numerics, originally derived from an
ancient mystery religion. This is what is uncovered.
If you ever read George Orwell's
1984, you should have no problem
understanding the message of this report. Beware, it is much scarier than a
Steven King
novel a more occultic than Harry Potter.
A hidden class of psychopathic
elites are running the world.
There will soon likely be a nuclear "911"-style terror event. The only
evidence left over about WHO DID IT a WHY will be by what is detailed in
this accurate report. The event will be falsely blamed on another group,
likely Iran.
There is a plan for a world government. Your government officials are for it
although they don't openly speak of it. They love their big money government
jobs, want to be a part of the a new world government 8: know of plans for
creating another huge terror event. And this is how.
Examine global terror
FACTS closely:
The remaining date is in the near future:
This terror ideology is: a world government dictatorship can only be founded
on the ruins of today's established order. Can you see the
psychotic serial killing pattern being applied? Terrorism is being used as a
tool to fool society into a dictatorship. It's that
simple. It is massive trickery. False blame (Iran) is then used for war
propaganda.
It's all based on lies.
Again, Current list of World's largest terror events & terror meetings
resorted by month [ 3, 6,9, ... ]:
-
2004-"3"-11, March 11th, 2004 Madrid
commuter train blast massacring "191"
-
2007-"6"-11 June 11th, 2007 11:30am
FBI/UN conference on nuclear terror [Please view the blue link provided
paragraphs above, right now, if you haven't verified this fact yet, It is a
fact. All of this is real. )
-
2001-"9"-11 September 11th, 2001 New York
City/World Trade Center > therefore the date [2010-"12"- 11 December 11th,
2010] comes next in the serial scripted sequence.
A "pre-planned" horrific
terror event to come that the insiders already know about.
"Fascinated by symbolism and numerology, the globalists" favorite tactic is
to leave blueprints to their plans "hidden in plain view." From messages
delivered to the masses through the media and films to Time Warner's
all-seeing eye, we are repeatedly reminded by the illuminati themselves that
they are controlling us and are omnipresent. World leaders from Clinton to
Prince William have been photographed proudly flashing the sign of the
devil.
Architecture around the globe is laid out to represent their occult
icons or structured based on occult numerology (like the pyramid Mitterrand
had constructed at the Louvre, which is made of 666 pieces of gold glass).
The New World Order's symbolism is everywhere and there are globalist
fingerprints all over the September 11th attacks as well as the Madrid train
bombing. "
- Alex Jones, of www.infowars.com, April 18th, 2004
Why a
possible Chicago terror event?
Examine the 110-story Sears Tower purchase by
Larry Silverstein (the 9-11 backstage creep who gave the command to demolish
WTC Building #7 on 9-11) & Partners on "3/11"/2004, bought the same day as
the Madrid Spain Train blasts: therefore not reported. The deal was valued
at $"911" million but finally sold for $835 million (Sears Tower purchase details)
Let's closely look how the global criminal class operates more in detail
using this reverse engineering of the elite agenda (using real history) &
rigorously verified numerical analysis used; expressed in the chart
following this factual historical survey of events - events that have gotten
the world to the state of where it is today:
Now this pattern is obvious, let's unfold actual world terror history
according to this same numerical patterning. The following chart absolutely
displays, unmistakably, the same mass serial killing pattern!
Summary of ALL large world government global terror events; each visibly

It is entirely obvious.
The course of world history has been dramatically
patterned and consistently marked with (3, 7, 11, 13), and (21, 33, 39), and
(9-11, 11-9) numerics over the past century. All major global terror events
and the biggest political assassinations have employed this pattern. There
isn't a single large terror event that hasn't been fit into this highly
structured, otherwise impossible, serial pattern. No person can disprove
what is clearly obvious. And there simply is not a group of Arabic people
behind it all. World History has been masterminded by the elite faction, and
the great majority have been been consistently lied to.
Will you ever need even more proof that the whole world needs to start
waking up to this psychotically administered world tyranny?!?!?!?! It's
not politics, it is not boring or futile, it is all pure global theater and
tyranny!!!! And it has everything to do with the future of your life.
Or is it better if you St all of us do nothing?
See, if you can't make the conscious decision to act and help inform others
- others won't for you. And EVERYONE is needed! EVERYONE must do a little
work! Everyone will either choose to continue to go into the temporary bliss
of denial, or everyone will decide to wake up to this and make this world a
much better place for themselves and for their children.
If everyone ( in the whole world ) doesn't decide to wake up to this - as it
isn't too difficult to recognize the huge problem given the analysis on
global terrorism provided in this report, things will just get much worse
for every common person in the entire world. Society will be intentionally
plagued with more staged terrorism and with a pandemic disease, put under
quarantine, and/or martial law.
Such a global atrocity is now in the works
as the analysis in this report proves. Regardless, your paper savings &
stocks will be constantly reduced in value and you might even find it
difficult to keep the system from seizing your home. Ultimately the plans
would be carried out to the extent of extermination of billions of adults
and subsequently your children would be enslaved even more than your life
has become.
For this to be stopped and reversed, the world's people must
rise to replace the entire global political system, rendering Washington DC,
the
British monarchy, the
United Nations,
The Fed,
The IMF, and
The World
Bank, entirely defunct. (The entire existing "Creep-tocracy" must be
replaced by a sane and humane system.)
Since about 50% of the world's wealth is owned by less than 1% of the
population, and 50% of the world's population owns less than 1% of the
world's wealth, the many national militaries would need to simultaneously
reverse their orders and course and unify together to stop firing on poor
hapless common people and instead establish control over and seize the
assets of the elite class for a subsequent wealth redistribution
commissioned by a newly reformed People's government.
Such elite owned
assets include:
This will only occur if The People WISE UP, agree to all RISE UP and support
such military action, and if God in Heaven is willing to allow for a,
maximally peaceful, Global People's Revolution. Clearly the current clan of
criminals corrupting this world, the entire cult of elite personality, must
all go, and be put on trial for their long list of crimes against humanity.
All major terror is signed by the elite. Will the next world government
terror event occur before 2010? Currently unknown. All of this is NO
coincidence beloved friends. It is no less than unmistakable proof that deniars always complain doesn't exist! Well, the facts are clear.
This is
how the elites
have carried out their agenda: their plans for a 'New World Order" corrupt
one world government.
This now obvious communication methodology through occultic numeric
signatures is the world government current open communication standard
amongst the dark freemasonic brotherhood & their darker, even lesser known,
"illuminati" grand masters of Orwellian/Machiavellian theatrics & mass mind
control high up in the capstone of the establishment pyramid of
manipulation.
There is no room for any doubt left: a "Cryptocracy" of
psychopathic ruling elites exist.
"Cryptocracy" is the term for "Shadow
Government".
Who are these unelected criminals running the world? They are the
wealthiest. Just follow the money.
This evidence glaringly displays not only the century long compromization of the world's mass media. but literally the complete modern day
abolition of a free press worldwide. The World's People are only receiving a
layer of carefully crafted THEATER placed on top of any existing randomly
occurring or staged big events, such as the staged event of 9-11.
And events
continue to happen frequently where the death counts reported in the
mainstream press are typically set (somehow) to a patterned number: "11"
and
reductions to "13" are the most frequent. "11, 911, 191, & 119" are the
signature marks of the events carried out by Western intelligence agencies
(pronounced by patriots across America: "al-CIAda':), and 13s appear to be
the marks of world government/UN/black operations/world military. And in
that regard it is by no coincidence why the United Nations building in New
Your City has exactly "39" floors, the triple 13 count! Yes, it is all
psychotic in nature.
So, maybe now you will never read or look at "the news" the same way again,
whether the 1984ish Orwellian/controlled media is reporting on Gl death
counts in Iraq or staged car/"suicide" bombings such as this example which
is rife with psychotic masonic numerology.
Do some quick homework!
Just look
at the facts.
(3/29 is the other 3/11' date as 2 + 9 sums to 11 - this event killed 119 - 911 reversed
- Iraqi citizens.)
Again, expressed most simply, this is how the insiders involved in global
terrorism communicate using the mainstream press; expressed in the headlines
in plain view, previously understandable only to insiders.
And this is how those involved in the world government Cryptocracy often
stroll down memory lane together. A masonic federal judge gave my friend &
fellow researcher
Fritz Springmeier, author:
The 13 Bloodlines of the
Illuminati, a "3x3" (9-year) sentence on "11/"13"/03:
FRITZ NEEDS TO BE FREED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!
Future global government conspiratorial mass serial patterning events
revealed in these observed sequences:

"3-11 "-04, "6-11"-07, "9-11 "-01 global serial patterned terror sequence
yields 12-11-2010 (December 11th): future day of preprogrammed mass chaos in
some kind of World War lll-ish context.

United Nations Superflu Pandemic surveillance system meeting.
More to come...
Please avoid worthless denial!
This global government researcher could write
a report 25 times longer than this one! I already have previously have
detailed this pattern and more in a 2005 ebook, entitled
The Freemasonic Architecture of History. I am just reporting on this horror show.
Where everyone else can help out
is with informing others. It is clearly & entirely obvious to dozens of New
World Order conspiracy researchers so far and they can't all be wrong about
this. All the world's people should become aware of the nature of the
deception that they are under. There is more power in numbers (of people)
for the people. I already have realized Homeland [In] security might jail or
kill me for this, but I am willing to soon be captured or killed to help end
this mass murdering insanity, to help save lives, to help restore peace,
through education.
You can help too! It's is not TOO LATE for anyone to help educate others,
even after the next staged "false flag" "inside-job" attack or even after
the Internet backbone has been disabled 'to keep us safe" as part of the
corrupt government's "Martial Law" plan for America. So, just PRINT this
short report out. Xerox copies. Sell booklets on the street or in stores for
a few dollars apiece! Most everyone can join together for this. The last
Amendment the criminals can remove is the 1st Amendment of free speech.
Therefore I am copying this information out over the internet in hopes to
save many lives. Now, it's up to you and everyone else to help, just a little
bit, put a stop to this madness, first by helping to educate others.
You can
help by fearlessly emailing/mailing/handing out this report to all your
friends, even the hard-headed, or people who think of themselves as "history

"A truth's initial commotion is directly proportional to how deeply the lie
was believed. When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to
the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and
its speaker a raving lunatic."

A visit with Congressman Ron Paul
the afternoon of 9/22/2007
Downtown
Chicago Illinois
The pleasure of meeting Dr. Ron Paul was mine today. He was at the Hyatt
Regency in Chicago at 3-5pm after a street rally on Michigan Ave. of
thousands marching and chanting "Who you going to call? Ron Paul!" and other
choruses.
When I entered the foyer, I just felt the door was wide open with
friendly supporters of Ron Paul mingling about, with lots of eye contact
from everyone and smiling faces. I suddenly felt like I didn't have enough
time to meet everyone I cared to meet, as my first priority was to compose a
note to Dr. Paul to insert into the book I wished to hand to him before the
end of the assembly.
We watched a video on the tremendous, huge, grassroots following he is
getting nationally, and even internationally. Then Ron Paul came to the
podium amidst persistent cheering.
For the next hour Ron Paul spoke about
Liberty, abolishing the Federal Reserve and IRS, an idea for new gold and
silver money, bringing the troops home, minding our own business, getting
out of the UN, retaining our privacy, stopping the National ID and forced
vaccinations, putting a road-block in any plans for a North American Union,
keeping the internet open, unregulated, and untaxed, going back to strict
constitutional law after repealing the 16th and 17 amendments, keeping
campaign promises, and many other good points.
He's talking about serious
change, and it took him an hour just to outline all the steps to get the US
back to being a free and prosperous and non-aggressive nation for at least
one more time around.
After his speech, the crowd poured in around him, most everyone desiring his
autograph and photos taken with the kind and gentle straight talking
statesman. As I had my new book this I wished to give him, his staff members and business suit
dressed security guards were fully supportive and gave me the red carpet to
meet him. I made a joke to the security guards, "I see no Tazers here thank
goodness!".
They all laughed in a slightly perplexed fashion.
I felt like I was at a public event like no other. Thousands of people were
in the giant conference room, all in perfect agreement and harmony. There
was warmth and a general feeling of abounding peace and a very natural sense
of security in the room, almost like being at home with family. There were
people with newborns wanting their babies to be photographed in Ron Paul's
arms. One time I was close in line to meeting him, and as he handed a
newborn back to his/her mom, I said "Oh, that makes 4000 and 1 now!" Dr. {of
Obstetrics} Ron Paul looked right into my eyes as I said that, got my little
joke, and warmly laughed back.
I waited patiently about a half hour as he
signed many hundreds of autographs. As I was standing amidst the crowd many
people took interest in the book I was holding... many Ron Paul supporters.
I was real hesitant to give this book away as it with the first copy printed
and the only copy I had and I am rather poor these days on top of that.
However one supporter who wanted to buy the book from me, changed his mind
and urged me to give it to him, as he felt it was important for the cause. I
suddenly agreed with him 100% that it was the right thing to do. (I was
actually going to ask him to buy it, but I just considered the gift a
campaign contribution.)
We shook hands. He remembered my initial question to him in 2003 at a
Bastrop Texas Ron Paul convention.
Well, I gave him an update on that question with giving Him a fresh
full-color hardcover copy of the new book and copies for his staff members
too...
He might be reading it and looking at all David Dee's incredible artwork too
right now as I am writing this, the day after, 9/23/2007... Could this be a
start of a historical healing process? A possible new Nuremberg in the name
of justice for those hidden criminal dynasties that sponsored the original
trial itself (to only cast all WW II blame just on certain Nazi leaders)?
That is what is needed if all the positive changes he was talking about is
really going to take place in the USA. I hope he will understand that from
analyzing the research contained in this new book. Ron Paul radiates Hope
and the message of Liberty, something I hope will begin re-stimulating the
most constitutionally comatose of countrymen and women from sea to shining
sea.

What are the goals of the New World Order Elite Run Cult Conspiracy?
-
Consolidate everything.
-
Commercialize everything.
-
Classify everything.
-
Claim everything.
-
Control everything.
-
Murder 2/3rds of your family to bring the population down by billions.
-
Microchip the remaining depopulation plague & World War III survivors.
-
Maintain humanity under 500 million.
-
Regulate reproduction.
-
Rule passion - faith - tradition - and all things.
-
Protect the state with corrupt courts.
-
Track and trace everyone except the elites, everywhere, all the time.
-
Get everyone speaking English and everyone worshiping Lucifer.
-
Establish up a world court and execute dissidents.
-
Avoid useless officials.
-
Create a communist superstate with a socialist appearance.
-
Suppress truth. Continuously have the dark deeds of history overwritten.
-
Be a parasitic elite class cancer on the earth.
We know who's really behind the Shadow Government, the New World Order, or
the Global Union.
They're all one and the same:
And this cult has already infil"trait(or)"ed all
of the three letter government institutions and the owned and controlled
mass media.
"So do not be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed that will not be
disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known What I tell you in the
dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from
the roofs."
St. Matthew, 10-26 & 27
By establishing a private bank that can openly
counterfeit America's
currency in 1913, the elite bankers have had access to endless supply of
excess money to buy off any number of people in an attempt to constantly
suppress truth about the New World Order plan.
By controlling American's
entire money supply and the interest it is loaned out to the government and
other entities, they affect if the stock market will rapidly plummet or
rise, and they always know in advance, so the insiders can profit even more
by playing the "business cycle"; while the millions of little investors
always lose in the long run.
Its a Giant Fraud!
The whole existing system is
run more corrupt than a Las Vegas casino! What a scam! On top of that, the DJIA might go up, but the value of the dollar is always being reduced. There
is no "gain" over time, just taxes.
When the DJIA, was at 7,000 the dollar
was worth double what it buys today.
A gallon of gas cost half, for example.

because they need external enemies to exert internal control over their own
people." - Richard Perle

"Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear kept us in a

- General Douglas
Macarthur, 1957
-

But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy,
and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is
a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist
dictatorship ... Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to

survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less
formidable, for he is known and he carries his banners openly. But the
traitor moves among those within the gate freely, his sly
whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of
government itself. For the traitor appears not traitor, he
speaks in the accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and
their garments, and he appeals to the baseness that
lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works
secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the
pillars of a city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer
resist. A murderer is less to be feared." - Cicero, 42 B.C.

"Violence does not and cannot exist by itself; it is invariably
intertwined with the lie." - Alexander Solzhenitsyn

war, who prepare for it, and who, by holding out vague promises of future

does away with good men, forbids education and light, controls every
movement of the citizens and, keeping them under a perpetual servitude,
wants them to grow accustomed to baseness and cowardice, has his spies
everywhere to listen to what is said in the meetings, and spreads dissension
and calumny among the citizens and impoverishes them, is obliged to make war
in order to keep his subjects occupied and impose on them permanent need of
a chief." - Aristotle

come to believe it." - Goebbels

people from the political, economic and/or military

greatest enemy of the State." - Goebbels

program who demonstrated a radio controlled bull

"There is no such thing, at this date of the world's history, in America, as
an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who
dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand
that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest
opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid
similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish
as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another
job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper,
before twenty four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the
Journalist is to destroy truth; To lie outright; To pervert; To vilify; To
fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his
daily bread. You know it and I know it and what folly is this toasting an
independent press? We are the tools and vassals for rich men behind the
scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our
talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men.
We are intellectual prostitutes."

"The mass media is itself part of the same power structure that plunders the
planet and inflicts human rights abuses on a massive scale" - David Cromwell

free. The truth has been kept from the depth of
their minds by masters who rule them with lies. They feed them on falsehoods
till wrong looks like right in their eyes." - Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe

own fund raising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of
national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law
itself." - Senator Daniel K. Inouye
-
"The real rulers in Washington are invisible, and exercise power from
behind the scenes." - Supreme Court Justice Felix
Frankfurter, 1952
-
"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of
unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the
military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of
misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of
this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should
take nothing for granted." - Dwight D. Eisenhower
-
"Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government
owing no allegiance and acknowledging no
responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to
befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and
corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day."
-
Theodore Roosevelt
-
"Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me
privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the Field of
commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a
power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so
complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when
they speak in condemnation of it."
- Woodrow Wilson, The New Freedom (1913)
-
"A power has risen up in the government greater than the people
themselves, consisting of many and various powerful
interests, combined in one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of
the vast surplus in banks." - John C. Calhoun, Vice
President of the United States
-
"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties
than standing armies...The issuing power should be taken from the banks and
restored to the Government, to whom it properly belongs."
- Thomas Jefferson

"If the people only understood the rank injustice of our Money and Banking
system, there would be a revolution before
morning." - Andrew Jackson
-
"There is an evil which ought to be guarded against in the indefinite
accumulation of property from the capacity of holding it in perpetuity
by... corporations. The power of all corporations ought to be limited in this
respect. The growing wealth acquired by them never fails to be a source of
abuses." - James Madison
-
"In this point of the case the question is distinctly presented whether
the people of the United States are to govern through
representatives chosen by their unbiased suffrages or whether the money and
power of a great corporation are to be secretly
exerted to influence their judgment and control their decisions."
- Andrew
Jackson
-
"I am more than ever convinced of the dangers to which the free and unbiased
exercise of political opinion -- the only sure foundation and safeguard of
republican government -- would be exposed by any further increase of the
already overgrown influence of corporate authorities."
- Martin Van Buren,
Eighth President of the United States
-
"As we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the
existence of trusts, combinations, and monopolies, while
the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an
iron heel. Corporations, which should be the
carefully restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people,
are fast becoming the people's masters."
- Grover
Cleveland, 22nd and 24th President of the United States
-
"I again recommend a law prohibiting all corporations from contributing to
the campaign expenses of any party.... Let individuals contribute as they
desire; but let us prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from
making contributions for any political purpose, directly or indirectly."
Teddy Roosevelt added, "The fortunes amassed through corporate organization
are now so large, and vest such power in those that wield them, as to make
it a
matter of necessity to give to the sovereign -- that is, to the
Government, which represents the people as a whole -- some effective
power of supervision over their corporate use. In order to insure a
healthy social and industrial life, every big corporation should be held
responsible by, and be accountable to, some sovereign strong enough to
control its conduct." - Theodore
Roosevelt
-
"It was natural and perhaps human that the privileged princes of these new
economic dynasties, thirsting for power, reached
out for control over government itself. They created a new despotism and
wrapped it in the robes of legal sanction. ...And as a result the average
man once more confronts the problem that faced the Minute Man...."
- Franklin Roosevelt
-
"A small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete
control over other people's property, other people's money, other people's
labor -- other people's lives. For too many of us life was no longer free;
liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of
happiness." - Franklin Roosevelt
-
"These economic royalists complain that we seek to overthrow the
institutions of America. What they really complain of is that
we seek to take away their power. Our allegiance to American institutions
requires the overthrow of this kind of power. In vain
they seek to hide behind the flag and the Constitution. In their blindness
they forget what the flag and the Constitution stand
for." - Franklin Roosevelt

"It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history
is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the
lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny
ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of
energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the
mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."
- Robert F. Kennedy

"Truth always rests with the minority, and the minority is always stronger
than the majority, because the minority is generally
formed by those who really have an opinion, while the strength of a majority

minority is the stronger) assume its opinion ...while Truth again reverts to a new minority."

" When, in the course of human events, it
becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which
have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the
earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of
nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the
separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are
created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain
inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted
among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed;
that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends,
it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute
new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect
their safety and happiness." -

OUR PREDICAMENT
" Quigley confirms that a network of banking dynasties has, in Skousen's
words, "acquired a Inform others choke-hold on the affairs of practically
the entire human race."
According to Quigley, they include Baring, Lazard,
Erlanger, Warburg, Schroder, Selingman, the Speyers, Mirabaud, Malet, and
above 11 Rothschild and Morgan."
(Citations are from Tragedy & Hope , 51-52)
Quigley confirms that, starting with the Bank of England in 1694, these
dynasties organized themselves in a system of central banks that charge
their respective nations billions of dollars in interest for the privilege
of using currency backed by the nations' own credit. In other words, they
have carried off a swindle of monstrous proportions.
Quigley quotes William
Gladstone who as Chancellor of the Exchequer said in 1852:
"The government
itself was not to be a substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to
leave the Money Power supreme and unquestioned."
(325)
Put another way, a private credit monopoly controls the governments' purse
strings. Able to create money out of nothing, they naturally grabbed as much
of the world's real wealth as they could.
Quigley writes about the formation
of their American cartels:
"The period 1884-1933 was he period of financial
capitalism in which investment bankers moving into commercial banking and
insurance on the one side, and into railroading and heavy industry on the
other were able to mobilize enormous wealth and wield enormous economic,
political and social power." (71)
Indeed their representatives, the "Eastern Establishment" i.e. the Morgans
and now
the Rockefellers run the United States.
(72) The principle mechanism
is the
Council on Foreign Relations.
According to Quigley, the ultimate goal
is,
"nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in
private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the
economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled ...by the
central banks...acting in concert."
(324)
Quigley confirms that the bankers
have usurped mankind's collective instincts by financing the Socialist and
Communist movements. Bankers love big government because the ultimate
monopoly is the State. Through it, they take over their competition and
control debt, resources, market demand and labor.
Speaking of the Communist takeover of the US government in the 1930s and
1940's, Quigley writes,
"it must be understood that the power that these
energetic left-wingers exercised was never their own power of Communist
power but was ultimately the power of the international financial coterie."
In other words, millions of idealists committed to human brotherhood and
equality were (and are) duped into advancing a totalitarian scheme to
concentrate the world's wealth and power into the hands of the superrich.
More opportunistic Leftists, Communists, Feminists and Globalists prosper
while piously pretending to serve humanity.
"The Money Power controls the
debate and encourages gridlock by backing all shades of the political
spectrum and marginalizing anyone who shines the spotlight on them. (Ever
wonder why the word "Rothschild" has never crossed Noam Chomsky's lips? Or
why the John Birch Society debunks the obvious fact that
9-11 was an "inside
job?") The
media is controlled through direct ownership and advertising."

" The problem is mass murdering counterfeiters (international bankers) run
this world. And if the world was a tree, that would be the trunk of the
world's problem. All the branches and everyone who supports the problem is
just as much a part of problem as the core problem itself. The answer to the
problem is The People allowing for a system of currency regulated by The
People.
As long as mass murdering counterfeiters are running the world, high
crimes will run rampant, and the people who speak the truth of it will
continue to be regarded by society as lunatics or criminals by the way of
psychologically projecting their association with and individual culpability
of the problem onto such freedom lovers. "

" I think myself that we have more machinery of government than is
necessary, too many parasites living on the labor of the industrious.
Government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take
everything you have ... The course of history shows that as a government
grows, liberty decreases. The two enemies of the people are criminals and
government, so let us tie the second down with the chains of the
constitution so the second will not become the legalized version of the
first. "
