Leon Edward Panetta
President Elect Obama did more than just play golf and relax at his
exclusive Kailua beachfront rental during his end of year Hawaii holiday. He
spent time deciding on who would fill one of his key national security
positions Director of the CIA. His choice of an outsider to the
intelligence community, Leon Panetta, has been
both welcomed and
criticized by intelligence experts.
Panetta achieved prominence as President Clintons Chief of Staff
(1994-1997). He is a veteran political insider and his supporters hope he
can rebuild morale in the CIA which was badly tarnished by faulty
intelligence assessments that led to the Iraq war.
Significantly, Panetta is close to John Podesta who served as Panettas
deputy during the Clinton Administration. Podesta eventually became
Clintons Chief of Staff from 1998-2001. Podesta currently serves as
co-chair of Obamas transition team, and the selection of Panetta reflects
Podestas influence.
Podesta has been an outspoken advocate of increased declassification of
government documents. Both Panetta and Podesta were in key positions to
support President Clintons
Executive Order 12958 passed on April 17 1995. EO 12958 made it easier to declassify national security information that had
been unnecessarily classified for decades.
Among the many classified national security files targeted for
declassification were those related to FBIs X-Files The X-Files was a term
that could be traced to the FBIs historic efforts to get to the bottom of
the UFO phenomenon. These files were often categorized under "Flying Discs:
Security Matter-X". The X-Files became immortalized in the hit television
series of the same name.
During the Clinton administration, Podesta was open about his interest in
the X-Files television series. This led to his support for declassification
of many national security files, especially those concerning UFOs. On
October 22, 2002, Podesta made a statement at the National Press Club
concerning the legality of UFO information that has not been released to the
public on national security grounds.
He said:
"I think it's time to open the
books on questions that have remained in the dark on the question of
government investigations of UFOs.
Interest in finding about UFOs in the Clinton administration wasnt just
limited to Podesta.
Webster Hubble was a personal friend of President Clinton who had appointed
him as associate attorney general of the Justice Department. In his
autobiography,
Hubble wrote:
"Clinton had said, 'If I put you over at
Justice I want you to find the answers to two questions for me. One, who
killed JFK? And two, are there UFOs?'... Clinton was dead serious. I had
looked into both, but wasn't satisfied with the answers I was getting."
Clintons interest in finding the truth of UFOs very likely influenced his
choice of the last Intelligence Community outsider, who like Panetta, was
asked to head the CIA. Former CIA Director James Woolsey was very interested
in finding out about any UFO information secretly kept at the CIA.
In fact, Woolsey was given
an informal
briefing by Dr
Stephen Greer in 1993 who told him what civilian
researchers had discovered about UFOs. Woolsey then ordered the CIA to
prepare a report on all its information about UFOs. Woolsey was part of a
hushed up effort by the Clinton administration to find the truth about UFOs.
The choice of Panetta as CIA Director signals that the Obama administration
is also interested in the declassification of files concerning UFOs. Panetta
will likely spearhead efforts by the Obama administration to pressure the
CIA to release its deepest held secrets the CIAs X-Files.
