Chances are, if youve ever sent a package
overnight, bought a PC or a can of soda, youve paid your hard-earned money
to a major Pentagon contractor.
While large defense corporations that make
fighter jets and armored vehicles garner the most attention, tens of
thousands of civilian companies, from multi-national corporations hawking
toothpaste and shampoo to
big oil behemoths and even
local restaurants
scattered across the United States, all supply the Pentagon with the
necessities used to carry on day-to-day operations and wage Americas wars.
And theyve made a killing doing it
since 9/11.
In 2001, the massive arms dealers Lockheed
Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman ranked one, two and five among
Department of Defense contractors, raking in $14.7 billion, $13.3 billion
and $5.2 billion, respectively, in contracts.
Last year, Lockheeds contract dollars were
almost double their pre-9/11 level, clocking in at $28 billion, while
Boeings had jumped to almost $19 billion and Northrop Grumman, still in the
five spot, had more than doubled its 2001 take, with $12.8 billion in
contracts.
Americas recent wars have obviously been good to these companies.
On
September 10, 2001, Lockheeds
share price was $38.32. Today, it tops $70
per share. In 2001, the companys net sales reached
$24 billion. Last year,
they were almost
$46 billion. Likewise, Northrop Grummans net income has
more than quadrupled in the last decade, according to the investment
analysis website,
Seeking Alpha.
Still, these corporations are just a fraction of
the story when it comes to the massive sums of money made by the military
contractors since September 11, 2001.
Chris Hellman of the National Priorities Project, writing recently at
TomDispatch.com, noted that since the 9/11 attacks, the United States has
spent about $8 trillion on national security.
Even accounting for all the funds paid out for
troop salaries,
overseas bases construction and the training and equipping
indigenous allies in Iraq and Afghanistan, among many other costs, its
clear that vast sums of Pentagon money are flowing somewhere other than to
the top weapons-makers. Unknown to most U.S. taxpayers and even many
Pentagon-watchers, some of the largest and most recognizable corporations in
the world have also been getting rich on Americas wars.
Below are five examples of civilian companies
that have reaped major rewards from the Pentagon during its last decade at
war:
-
BP
The oil giant, perhaps most famous for
dumping
206 million gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico last
year, is also a
perennial power when it comes to Pentagon contracts.
Back in 2001, BP nabbed a cool $357
million in contracts from the Department of Defense. Last year, the
number hit $1 billion and its no secret why.
As defense-tech writer Noah Shachtman noted at
Foreign Policy last year, the U.S. military
burns 22 gallons of diesel [fuel] per soldier per day in
Afghanistan, at a cost of more than $100,000 a person annually.
-
FedEx
The overnight shipping giant is a
long-time defense-contracting powerhouse that has also seen an
exponential increase in contract dollars since September 10, 2001,
when its stock was trading at just under
$40 per share.
By the end of that year, FedEx had been
awarded about $211 million in contracts from the Pentagon. In 2010,
the company received $1.4 billion from the Department of Defense and
this year, with its stock closing in on $80 per share, has already
passed the $1 billion mark, again.
This includes a
$182 million deal, inked
in August, to pack and ship fresh fruit and vegetables to U.S.
military bases overseas and a
joint agreement, which also includes
United Parcel Service (UPS) and Polar Air Cargo, which could last up
to five years and potentially net the companies a combined $853
million.
-
Dell
If youre in the military and you want
to pilot a drone, transfer supplies or write a memo, you need a
computer.
Thats just what Dell provides. The
desktop- and laptop-maker has been plying the Pentagon with
computers for many years and, just like Lockheed, Boeing and
Northrop Grumman, has done especially well by the Department of
Defense since 2001.
That year, Dell was awarded $65 million
in Pentagon contracts. By 2009, that number had jumped to $731
million and, over the course of the decade, has added up to a total
of $4.3 billion in contracts for the PC manufacturer.
-
Kraft
From A-1 steak sauce, their signature
mayonnaise and Oreo cookies to Oscar Meyer hot dogs, Planters
peanuts and Wheat Thins crackers, this company ranks as one of the
largest and best known food concerns in the world.
Not surprisingly, it also does a brisk
business with the Pentagon which has grown ever larger during the
last decade. Back in 2001, Kraft inked $148 million in deals with
the Department of Defense, by 2010, its yearly take had risen to
$373 million.
-
Pepsi
Once upon a time it was the choice of a
new generation.
These days, its the choice of the
Pentagon. In 2010, PepsiCo washed down $217 million in Defense
Department contract dollars, compared to the mere $61 million in
deals it inked back in 2001.
Earlier this year, the company continued
the trend by signing a multi-million dollar deal to provide the
Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps with bag-in-box beverages.
(That very same day, Coca-Cola also received a slightly larger
contract to provide drinks for the military.)
Other big-name firms that are regularly awarded
large, lucrative deals from the Defense Department include:
-
tire titans Goodrich and Goodyear
-
oil giants Shell and Exxon Mobil
-
big food suppliers like Nestle, General
Mills, Tyson, ConAgra and Campbell's Soup
-
tech and telecom stalwarts including
AT&T, Oracle, Sony and Verizon
A decade of
waging wars abroad, from Iraq and
Afghanistan to Pakistan and Libya to Yemen and Somalia hasnt been kind to
average Americans.
As the United States poured nearly
$8 trillion
into national security spending, and the national debt ballooned from
$6
trillion to $14.3 trillion, the official unemployment rate has more than
doubled - from
4.5% to
9.1%.
Meanwhile the number of children living in
poverty in the U.S. has jumped nearly 20% since 2000, according to the
National Center for Children in Poverty. And for older Americans, the risk
of hunger has spiked almost 80% since 2001, according to
a recent report by
AARP. But from car companies to candy makers and even the
biggest brands in
organic food, so many of the worlds favorite companies have, over these
years, cashed in on Americas wars.
In his famous
1961 farewell address, President Dwight Eisenhower warned of
the,
"acquisition of unwarranted influence" by
what he called the "military-industrial complex.
Today, however, the "large arms industry" that
Eisenhower warned about is only part of the equation.
Civilian firms such as FedEx and PepsiCo form
the backbone of what more accurately can be described as a
military-corporate complex of civilian businesses that enable the Pentagon,
Almost a decade after Eisenhower's farewell address, there were still only
about
22,000 prime contractors doing business with the Department of
Defense. Last year, according to U.S. government records, the number stood
at almost 135,000.
The reasons why are simple. Big war budgets and
ever-increasing national security spending have made the Pentagons deep,
taxpayer-filled pockets especially attractive as a stable source of income
in economically uncertain times.
Most Americans will never buy anything directly from Lockheed Martin, Boeing
or Northrop Grumman, but many have spent money on,
...or paid for cell phone service from AT&T or
Verizon - all of them big-time defense contractors.
These and other large corporations have done
very well, reaping rewards not only from Americans at the checkout counter
but from their tax dollars by way of the Pentagon.
Meanwhile, halfway across the planet, large
numbers of Afghans and Iraqis - who have seen their lives upended, their
homes destroyed, and their family members killed and wounded - have suffered
as a direct result of the efforts of these and other members of the
military-corporate complex.
Even with the specter of only modest growth (or even cuts) in defense
spending on the horizon, the number of companies seeking the stability of a
Pentagon paycheck is likely only to rise.
And with it, the U.S. civilian economy is sure
to become further militarized by stealth corporations cashing in on a state
of permanent war, while the American public remains largely oblivious to
their role in the military-corporate complex and Americas war-making
overseas.
