NSA surveillance controversy
centered on U.S.
fear that Europe's economic powerhouse
will dump the dollar
Financial analyst Jim Willie sensationally
claims that Germany is preparing to ditch the unipolar system backed by NATO
and the U.S. in favor of joining the BRICS nations, and that this is why the
NSA was caught spying on Angela Merkel and other German leaders.
In an
interview with USA Watchdog's Greg
Hunter, Willie, a statistical analyst
who holds a PhD in statistics, asserted that the real reason behind the
recent NSA surveillance scandal targeting Germany was centered around the
United States' fear that Europe's financial powerhouse is looking to escape
from an inevitable dollar collapse.
"I think they are looking for details on
assisting Russia on dumping the dollar. I think they are looking for details
for a secret movement for Germany to get away from the dollar and join the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.) This is exactly what
I think they are going to do," said Willie.
Earlier this month,
the BRICS nations (Brazil,
Russia, India, China and South Africa),
announced the creation of a new $100 billion dollar anti-dollar
alternative IMF bank to be based in Shanghai and chaired by Moscow.
Putin launched the new system by saying it was
designed to,
"help prevent the harassment of countries that do not agree
with some foreign policy decisions made by the United States and their
allies," a clear signal that Russia and other BRICS countries are moving to
create a new economic system which is adversarial to
the IMF and the World
Bank.
Offering an insight into the attitude of the
western elite towards Russia, comments made by the likes of former US
ambassador to Iraq Christopher R. Hill suggest that Moscow is increasingly
being viewed as a rogue state.
Back in April, Hill said that Russia's response to the Ukraine crisis
meant that Moscow had betrayed the "new world order" it has been a part of
for the last 25 years.
In another sign that BRICS nations are moving to
create an entirely new multi-polar model adversarial to the west, the five
countries are also
constructing an alternative Internet backbone which will circumvent the
United States in order to avoid NSA spying.
Willie also ties the Germany's move into last
week's
shoot down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which has been exploited
by the U.S. and Britain to push for more stringent sanctions on Russia
despite the fact that they have had little effect so far and only appear to
be harming the trade interests of countries in mainland Europe.
"Here's the big, big consequence. The U.S.
is basically telling Europe you have two choices here.
Join us with the
war against Russia. Join us with the sanctions against Russia. Join us
in constant war and conflicts, isolation and destruction to your economy
and denial of your energy supply and removal of contracts. Join us with
this war and sanctions because we'd really like you to keep the dollar
regime going.
They are going to say were tired of the dollar... We are
pushing Germany. Don't worry about France, don't worry about England,
worry about Germany. Germany has 3,000 companies doing active business
right now.
They are not going to join the sanctions -
period."
