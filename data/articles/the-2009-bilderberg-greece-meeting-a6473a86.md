Are the People Who 'Really Run The World' Meeting This Weekend? by Adam Abrams 14 May, 2009
from Haaretz Website

currently working as an intern at Haaretz.com
The Bilderberg group, the topic of many conspiracy theories, is now meeting behind closed doors in Greece. From today until May 17, approximately 150 of the most influential members of the world's elite will be meeting behind closed doors at a hotel in Greece. They are called the Bilderberg Group or the "Bilderbergers," and you have probably never heard of them. The group, co-founded by Prince Bernard of the Netherlands, has been meeting in secret every year since 1954. This year, says the British broadsheet The Times, they are meeting at the Nafsika Astir Palace in Vouliagmeni. The individuals at the meeting come from such power houses as Google and the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Senate and European royalty. Governments, the banking industry, big oil, media and even the world of academia are amongst the Bilderberg ranks. Those reportedly in attendance at last year's conference in Virginia include:
former U.S. senator Tom Daschle Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner and his predecessor Henry M. Paulson former U.S. secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice Microsoft executive Craig Mundie senior Wall Street Journal editor Paul Gigot World Bank President Robert Zoellick Google CEO Eric Schmidt
former U.S. senator Tom Daschle
Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner and his predecessor Henry M. Paulson
former U.S. secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice
Microsoft executive Craig Mundie
senior Wall Street Journal editor Paul Gigot
World Bank President Robert Zoellick
Google CEO Eric Schmidt
There is no official list of who's who in Bilderberg and there are no press conferences about the meetings. This is because the group operates under the "Chatham House Rule," and no details of what goes on inside are released to the press. This secrecy has led to many claims that the Bilderberg Group are the world's real "kingmakers," and, some even suggest, behind the global financial crisis. There are also rumors concerning Bilderberg's 2008 conference in Virginia, claiming that the recent U.S. presidential election was decided upon in a secret meeting between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, courtesy of Bilderberg. Those involved in Bilderberg reject such claims outright, arguing that the forum offers a chance for world leaders to discuss international affairs openly and honestly. Former British cabinet minister, Lord Denis Healey, who was one of the founders of the group, branded assumptions of world domination as "crap!" and said that the group's aims were much purer. In an interview to journalist Jon Ronson of the Guardian, Healey said:
"Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn't go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing."
Veteran Bilderberg-watcher Daniel Estulin says that the big topic on the agenda for this year is the global depression. Estulin quotes sources connected to the group as saying that the group is looking at two options,
"either a prolonged, agonizing depression that dooms the world to decades of stagnation, decline, and poverty... or an intense-but-shorter depression that paves the way for a new sustainable economic world order, with less sovereignty but more efficiency."
As the BBC's Jonathan Duffy noted in 2004, the air of mystery has fueled the increasingly popular conspiracy theory that the Bilderberg meetings are where decisions affecting the entire world are made.
"No reporters are invited in and while confidential minutes of meetings are taken, names are not noted," Duffy wrote. "In the void created by such aloofness, an extraordinary conspiracy theory has grown up around the group that alleges the fate of the world is largely decided by Bilderberg."
Recently, mainstream press coverage of the Bilderberg meeting has grown, largely due to the internet.
This year's conference may have been covered by British broadsheets, but don't expect to see any coverage from U.S. news outlets such as The Wall Street Journal or the Washington Post - they will most likely be at the conference.
Our Man at Bilderberg - I'm Ready to Lose Control, But They're Not by Charlie Skelton 15 May 2009
from TheGuardian Website
Charlie Skelton feels a sudden need to apologize for the trouble he's caused, swiftly followed by a rush of revolutionary rage against the powers that be being so, well, powerful
I want to talk about Bilderberg 2009.
But beyond a simple "yes, it's happening, it's real, the leaders of the world are hanging out here for the weekend", what can I say?
It's a private meeting. I don't know if they're discussing global financial unification or the season finale of Grey's Anatomy over their prawn cocktails. I don't even know what the vegetarian option is for starters. Butternut squash? You're going to have to forgive me for speculating, but that's all I can do. I'm not a proper reporter. I don't have the foggiest of my rights (if any) to stand on public footpaths and point cameras. I don't even have a proper camera. But what I do have is this: a sense of something rotten in the state of Greece. To my nose, there's not a healthy smell wafting down from the Astir Palace. Or maybe that was the egg and pepper roll I had for breakfast. Sorry if some of these speculations are wrongheaded, but I'm doing a lot of this thinking for the first time and I've only just shaken off my police escort. Sorry if I sound shrill or petulant, self-righteous or precious, sorry if my perceptions have been tilted by anger sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry for bothering you Mr Bilderberg. I've spent the last three days apologizing to everyone.
Sorry to the staff at my hotel for having plainclothes officers loafing around in their lobby. Sorry to the plainclothes officers themselves for having to drag them around Vougliameni on a wild goose chase (I bought them some chilled water, and took it to them while they shuffled awkwardly behind a tree).
Sorry then to the desk sergeant for bothering her with my predicament:
"I'm being followed around like a criminal, I wonder if you wouldn't mind asking them to stop? I'm not doing anything wrong, and it's getting well a bit annoying."
I'm going to stop apologizing now.
I'm going to try and make sense of my experiences. It's not easy; I don't want to sound feeble-minded, but this has been a lot to take in. I feel a bit like I've driven down the wrong alley and suddenly don't recognize anything, and people are staring at me and not simply to admire my hair. I'm jumpy. I think someone has been in my room and moved my laptop. I know this sounds bonkers, I know it does, but I took a photo of it before I left the room and it wasn't where I left it. Listen to me. I sound like a fruitcake. Three days and I've been turned into a suspect, a troublemaker, unwanted, ill at ease, tired and a bit afraid. And I haven't even walked up the road to the Bilderberg hotel since the whole "get in the car!" incident. I've been trying to stay out of trouble, but trouble has followed me down the hill. So to make sense of it. I'm going to begin here: with the face of the first Bilderberg delegate I saw in the flesh. I was trying, lamely, to get a snap of some delegates as they swooshed through Vougliameni in their mirrored limos with their plainclothes motorcycle outriders and police escorts. And one of them had their window open. I was so excited I forgot to bring the camera to my face and took a photo of the hubcap. What I saw I won't forget.
It was a 40-something man with his head thrown back, laughing and laughing, the perfect photograph that only my retina will ever see. And you know what: no wonder he was happy. It must be WAY COOL to be sirened through Greek streets in the back of bulletproof limo on your way to the COOLEST party in the world. You've been invited by the coolest of the cool kids to hang out for the weekend.
Your cool cousin's über-cool older brother and his way cool friends have got a keg of beer and a pool in the yard, and their parents are away and you think Jessica might be going. THIS IS THE BEST PARTY EVER! Turn on the sirens! We're coming through! Woohoo! And your life is already pretty cool. You already own a newspaper or head a thinktank, or you're the UK secretary of state for business, enterprise and regulatory reform, or you run Fiat, or you're chairman of the Federal Reserve or Queen of the Netherlands, or president of Shell Oil. You run stuff. You have big ideas. You're in control, and control is fun. Bilderberg is all about control. It's about "what shall we do next?"
We run lots of stuff already, how about we run some more? How about we make it easier to run stuff? More efficient. Efficiency is good. It would be so much easier with a single bank, a single currency, a single market, a single government. How about a single army? That would be pretty cool. We wouldn't have any wars then. This prawn cocktail is GOOD.
How about a single way of thinking? How about a controlled internet? How about not. I am so unbelievably back-teeth sick of power being flexed by the few. I've had it flexed in my face for three days, and it's up my nose like a wasp. I don't care whether the Bilderberg Group is planning to save the world or shove it in a blender and drink the juice, I don't think politics should be done like this. This might be a facile point, but if they were organizing a charity snooker league, they could do it upstairs at Starbucks. If they were trying to cure cancer they could do it with the lights on. Innocent thoughts can be minuted. Or maybe they're simply swingers. Maybe that's why the curtains are drawn. Imagine chucking your key in the tub and pulling out Ken Clarke. Sorry Timothy Geithner, that's the cost of doing business. I have a confession. (I'm not a swinger, that's not it.) My confession is that being tailed today by Greek special branch, and doubling back through a cafe and catching them out, and buying them chilled water on a hot day like in Beverley Hills Cop, when Eddie Murphy has room service sent to their car all this was pretty exciting. It's was my own little episode of the Equaliser. (The Greequaliser? No, really no, I'm tired).
Being tailed was exciting and funny and absurd and confusing and terrifying and utterly, utterly wrong. And I know this sounds pathetic but I got a bit teary in the police station when I was telling the nice desk sergeant lady that I'm not a bad person and not a threat to anyone, and it would be nice if someone could call off the goons. I don't like to be made to feel like this.
I've been "put" in this position, and I haven't deserved it. Bilderberg is about positions of control. I get within half a mile of it, and suddenly I'm one of the controlled. I'm followed, watched, logged, detained, detained again. I'd been put in that position by the "power" that was up the road. Likewise, the Bilderberg delegates occupy a position of power over the bobbing ignorance of the people patting beach balls in the sea, and me with my crappy little camera and my curiosity and my ill-formed sense of citizenship. I may not be very good at bearing witness here, but I'm doing my best. I haven't shinned over the fence and shoved a camera in David Rockefeller's face but I don't want to be shot in the forehead. A final thought for the day. In the fable, the men may have been blind but they did at least get to grope the elephant before trying to describe it. Now shove that elephant in the back of a blacked-out Mercedes S600, whisk it off into a luxury Greek resort, circle it with heavily armed guards and helicopters, hand it a Martini, and pay the local police to harass, detain and follow anyone showing even the slightest interest of grabbing a flank.
That, my friend, is the beast that is Bilderberg 2009.
Shadowy Bilderberg Group Meet in Greece - And Heres Their Address
May 14, 2009
from TheTimes Website
Bavarian illuminati Roger Boyes and John Carr in Athens
Dont tell anyone, dont breathe a word, but the worlds most powerful men are meeting secretly again to save the planet from economic catastrophe.
Oh, and their address, should you want to send them your opinions, is:
c/o Nafsika Astir Palace Hotel Apollonos Avenue 40 16671 Vouliagmeni Greece
c/o Nafsika Astir Palace Hotel
Apollonos Avenue 40
16671 Vouliagmeni
Greece
Bed space is a bit tight there for the next two days while the Bilderberg illuminati hold their private conclave in the five-star Greek hotel.
Every year since 1954 a club of about 130 senior or up-and-coming politicians gather at the fireside of a secluded hotel with top bankers and a sprinkling of royalty to discuss burning issues, to trade confidences and just stay abreast of the I-know-something-you-dont-know circuit. No lists of participants are disclosed, no press conferences are held; spill the beans and youre out of the magic circle. For those of us standing outside the locked gates all that is left is to hope that they will sleep well, avoid jet ski injury and solve our problems for us.
For the Bilderbergers it is a little like that recent MI5 recruitment ad:
See all your best work go unnoticed!
Each country delegates two people to the steering committee that is the intellectual hub of Bilderberg. In the past Kenneth Clarke, the Shadow Business Secretary, and Martin Taylor, formerly head of Barclays Bank, have had their hand on the British tiller. This year the club is going to talk about depression.
According to the pre-meeting booklet sent out to attendees, Bilderberg is looking at two options, says the Bilderberg-watcher Daniel Estulin - either a prolonged, agonizing depression that dooms the world to decades of stagnation, decline and poverty - or an intense but shorter depression that paves the way for a new sustainable economic world order, with less sovereignty but more efficiency.
Since Bilderberg does not officially exist, it cannot deny anything and is therefore manna from heaven for the conspiracy theorist.
Euro-skeptics are convinced that the future development of the European Union was plotted here - EU commissioners have always been welcomed into the coven, with Peter We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich Mandelson a particular favorite.
Margaret Thatcher, it is said, was a shy debutante at a Bilderberg meeting in 1975. Jim Tucker, veteran stalker of the Bilderberg club meetings, claims that Mrs Thatcher was ordered,
to dismantle British sovereignty, but she said, no way, so they had her sacked.
Left-wing conspiracy theorists believe that Bilderbergers form a capitalist nucleus, and there is a germ of truth in this.
The meetings were started in the Netherlands, in the Hotel de Bilderberg, near Arnhem, by the Polish exile Joseph Retinger. He was worried about growing anti-Americanism and the advance of Communism in Western Europe. Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands agreed to sponsor the idea, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Walter Bedell Smith, threw his weight behind it and so did the White House. The Bilderberg consensus is that national problems are best solved by an internationally oriented elite, that a global network of decision-makers should have a common language and that the boundaries are fluid between the monied and the political classes. And so there has been a natural bias towards inviting conservatives and market liberals. The only socialists invited are those who understand money. Ed Balls has taken part and the most indiscreet Bilderberger of all time was Denis Healey, the former Labour Chancellor and fierce Atlanticist.
To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair, Lord Healey told the author Jon Ronson for his book Them: Adventures with Extremists. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldnt go on for ever fighting one another for nothing. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing.

Another way of viewing the club is that of Metropolitan Seraphim, the bishop of Piraeus, who said that the Bilderbergers represented a,
criminal cabal of world Zionism and its efforts to set up a cruel world dictatorship under the headship of Lucifer.
This line is quite common on the blogosphere, where the clubs secrecy is taken as evidence of evil intentions. Whether Lucifer will be down there on the sun-loungers remains to be seen.
But what we have been able to establish from a World Bank spokesman, Alexis OBrien, is that the organization's president, Robert Zoellick, will be in Athens on unspecified business on May 14. And that US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithners public schedule is mysteriously empty for the next two days. Jo Ackermann, head of Deutsche Bank, will be traveling somewhere in Europe. Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the European Central Bank, will not be around until the end of the week.

You get the drift. Something is going on.
If only somebody would let us in on the secret.

In Grecia il Conclave Dei Potenti di Enrico Piovesana
18 Maggio, 2009
peacereporter.net
dal Sito Web MegaChip
In riva allEgeo la riunione annuale del Bilderberg Group E' iniziato ieri in Grecia, in un'esclusiva località balneare alle porte di Atene, l'annuale conclave dell'élite politico-economia-militare occidentale riunita nel Bilderberg Group: il più potente e riservato organo decisionale del pianeta che dal 1954 si riunisce ogni anno a porte chiuse per concertare le linee guida a cui tutti i governi, le banche centrali e gli organismi internazionali devono poi attenersi.
I lavori si concluderanno domenica.
Si parla di crisi economica
Centotrenta tra capi di Stato e di governo, ministri economici, banchieri centrali, economisti, amministratori delegati delle principali multinazionali, capi di Stato Maggiore, responsabili delle agenzie d'intelligence e direttori dei grandi netowork televisivi ed editoriali di Europa e Nord America sono arrivati nel lussuoso di Vouliagmeni, una ventina di chilometri a sud di Atene, in un susseguirsi di limousine blindate con vetri oscurati.
Giornalisti e curiosi sono tenuti a debita distanza dalla polizia greca e da guardie private e agenti servizi segreti di diversi Paesi.
Non sono previste conferenze stampa o comunicati ufficiali per sapere gli argomenti in discussione (solo nel 2006 gli organizzatori diramarono un documento in cui si rendeva noto che si sarebbe parlato di guerra al terrorismo, fonti energetiche, finanza e immigrazione).
Ma quest'anno lo scrittore russo Daniel Estulin (che da anni indaga e pubblica libri sul Bilderberg Group) ha dichiarato di essere riuscito a ottenere per vie traverse una copia dell'ordine del giorno dei lavori del summit greco, che sarebbe:
Il futuro dell'economia USA e del dollaro La disoccupazione Usa: soluzioni e previsioni Depressione o stagnazione prolungata? La ratifica del Trattato di Lisbona
Il futuro dell'economia USA e del dollaro
La disoccupazione Usa: soluzioni e previsioni
Depressione o stagnazione prolungata?
La ratifica del Trattato di Lisbona
Massimo riserbo anche sui partecipanti.
Secondo le informazioni raccolte dal quotidiano londinese Times, è certa la presenza,
del presidente della Banca Mondiale, Robert Zoellick del segretario al Tesoro USA, Tim Geithner del direttore della Banca Centrale Europea, Claude Trichet di quello della Banca Centrale Tedesca, Jo Ackermann

Una classe dirigente globale
Per avere un'idea degli altri partecipanti bisogna rifarsi alle foto rubate' dai teleobiettivi dei paparazzi ai precedenti incontri, alle informazioni trapelate in passato su singoli partecipazioni e soprattutto all'unica lista resa pubblica dal Bilderberg Group nel 2006 (immagine destra).
Il risultato è un elenco che comprende sempre:
i vertici dell'amministrazione Usa (in passato Henry Kissinger, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz) il grande banchiere David Rockefeller i dirigenti: della Federal Reserve di Credit Suisse della Rothschild Europe (il vice presidente Franco Bernabè) delle compagnie petrolifere Shell, Bp e Eni (Paolo Scaroni) della Coca Cola della Philips della Unilever di Time Warner di AoL della Tyssen-Krupp della Fiat (il vicepresidente John Elkann rappresentanti, della Nato dell'Onu della Banca Mondiale e della Ue i direttori e corrispondenti, del Times di Londra del Wall Street Journal del Financial Times dell'International Herald Tribune di Le Figarò del Globe and Mail del Die Zeit economisti (tra cui Giulio Tremonti e Mario Monti) molti ministri dei governi occidentali (Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa)
