Obama's "War on Ebola" or War for Oil?
Sending 3000 Troops to African "Ebola" Areas
that Happen to Export Oil to China
For a Nobel "Peace" Prize President, Barack Obama seems destined to go down in history books as the President who presided over one of the most aggressive series of wars ever waged by a bellicose Washington Administration.
Not even George Bush and Dick Cheney came close.
First, before the ink was even dry on his Nobel Prize certificate, Obama announced the Afghanistan "surge", pouring another 30,000 US military into that destroyed part of the world.
Then came Obama's war against Libya's Qaddafi, followed rapidly by his war to try to topple Syria's Bashar al Assad.
Soon after came Obama's "war for democracy in Ukraine," otherwise better called Obama's attempt to provoke Russia into a new war confrontation with NATO by backing a gaggle of Ukrainian oligarchs, criminals and outright neo-nazis in Kiev.
In July of this year, Obama's Administration was pushing the President to launch a second try at bombing Syria back to the Stone Age, allegedly to destroy ISIS, a looney Jihadist Sunni sect that was said to be a joint venture of the CIA and Israeli intelligence.
Now Obama's advisers, no doubt led by the blood-thirsty National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, have come up with a new war. This is the War Against Ebola.
On September 16, President Obama solemnly declared the war. He announced, to the surprise of most sane citizens, that he had ordered 3,000 American troops, the so-called "boots on the ground" that the Pentagon refuses to agree to in Syria, to wage a war against a virus?
In a carefully stage-managed appearance at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Obama read a bone-chilling speech. He called the alleged Ebola outbreaks in west Africa,
"a global threat, and it demands a truly global response. This is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security. It's a potential threat to global security, if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic," Obama continued, conjuring images that would have made Andromeda Strain novelist Michael Chrichton drool with envy.
Obama added,
"That has profound effects on all of us, even if we are not directly contracting the disease. This outbreak is already spiraling out of control."
With that hair-raising introduction, the President of the world's greatest Superpower announced his response.
In his role as Commander-in-'Chief' of the United States of America announced he has ordered 3,000 US troops to west Africa in what he called,
"the largest international response in the history of the CDC."
He didn't make clear if their job would be to shoot the virus wherever it reared its ugly head, or to shoot any poor hapless African suspected of having Ebola.
Little does it matter that the US military doesn't have anywhere near 3,000 troops with the slightest training in public health.
Before we all panic and line up to receive the millions of doses of untested and reportedly highly dangerous "Ebola vaccines" the major drug-makers are preparing to dump on the market, some peculiarities of this Ebola outbreak in Africa are worth noting.
CERTIFIED EBOLA DEATHS?
The World Health Organization, under the Director, Dr Margaret Chan, in a press conference on September 13, sounded the alarm, warning that Ebola in west Africa was surging out of control.
"In the three hardest hit countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of new patients is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them," Chan claimed.
WHO claims that almost half of 301 health-care workers dealing with alleged Ebola patients have themselves died, and that 2,400 people out of 4,784 cases in Africa have died of Ebola.
On August 8, Chan declared the African Ebola situation a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern," whatever that is supposed to mean. A major problem for Chan and her backers, however, is that her Ebola statistics are very, very dubious.
For those whose memory is short, this is the same Dr Margaret Chan at WHO in Geneva who was guilty in 2009 of trying to panic the world into taking unproven vaccines for "Swine Flu" influenza, by declaring a Global Pandemic with statistics calling every case of symptoms that of the common cold to be "Swine Flu," whether it was runny nose, coughing, sneezing, sore throat.
That changed WHO definition of Swine Flu allowed the statistics of the disease to be declared Pandemic.
It was an utter fraud, a criminal fraud Chan carried out, wittingly or unwittingly (she could be simply stupid but evidence suggests otherwise), on behalf of the major US and EU pharmaceutical cartel.
In a recent Washington Post article it was admitted that sixty-nine percent of all the Ebola cases in Liberia registered by WHO have not been laboratory confirmed through blood tests.
Liberia is the epicenter of the Ebola alarm in west Africa. More than half of the alleged Ebola deaths, 1,224, and nearly half of all cases, 2,046, have been in Liberia says WHO. And the US FDA diagnostic test used for the lab confirmation of Ebola is so flawed that the FDA has prohibited anyone from claiming they are safe or effective. That means, a significant proportion of the remaining 31 % of the Ebola cases lab confirmed through blood tests could be false cases.
In short, no one knows what 1,224 Liberians in recent weeks have died from. But WHO claims it to be Ebola. Note that the countries affected by the Ebola alarm are among the poorest and most war-torn regions in the world. Wars over blood diamonds and colonial genocidal tribal wars have left a devastated, mal-nourished population in its wake.
WHO's official fact sheet on Ebola, which now they renamed EVD for Ebola Virus Disease, claims,
"The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests, but the most recent outbreak in west Africa has involved major urban as well as rural areas "
WHO further notes that,
"It is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts. Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest."

Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest."
Then the official WHO Ebola Fact Sheet dated September, 2014, states,
"It can be difficult to distinguish EVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis."
Excuse me, Dr Margaret Chan, can you say that slowly?
It can be difficult to distinguish EVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis? And you admit that 69% of the declared cases have never been adequately tested? And you state that the Ebola symptoms include "sudden onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat? This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding"?

In short it is all the most vague and unsubstantiated basis that lies behind President Obama's new War on Ebola.
War on Ebola or War for Oil?
One striking aspect of this new concern of the US President for the situation in Liberia and other west African states where alleged surges of Ebola are being claimed is the presence of oil, huge volumes of untapped oil.
The offshore coast of Liberia and east African 'Ebola zones'
conveniently map with the presence of
vast untapped oil and gas resources.
The issue of oil in west Africa, notably in the waters of the Gulf of Guinea have become increasingly strategic both to China who is roaming the world in search of future secure oil import sources, and the United States, whose oil geo-politics was summed up in a quip by then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the 1970's:
'If you control the oil, you control entire nations.'
Obama Administration and Pentagon policy has continued that of George W. Bush who in 2008 created the US military Africa Command or AFRICOM, to battle the rapidly-growing Chinese economic presence in Africa's potential oil-rich countries.
West Africa is a rapidly-emerging oil treasure, barely tapped to date. A US Department of Energy study projected that African oil production would rise 91 percent between 2002 and 2025, much from the region of the present Ebola alarm.
Chinese oil companies are all over Africa and increasingly active in west Africa, especially Angola, Sudan and Guinea, the later in the epicenter of Obama's new War on Ebola troop deployment.
If the US President were genuine about his concern to contain a public health emergency, he could look at the example of that US-declared pariah Caribbean nation, Cuba.
Reuters reports that the Cuban government, a small financially distressed, economically sanctioned island nation of 11 million people, with a national budget of $50 billion, Gross Domestic Product of 121 billion and per capita GDP of just over $10,000, is dispatching 165 medical personnel to Africa to regions where there are Ebola outbreaks.
Washington sends 3,000 combat troops.
Something smells very rotten around the entire Ebola scare...
