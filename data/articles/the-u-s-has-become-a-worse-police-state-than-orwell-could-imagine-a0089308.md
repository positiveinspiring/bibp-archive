Putting Big Brother in the
Driver's Seat:
V2V Transmitters, Black Boxes & Drones
The United States
pretends to be a home of 'freedom' and 'democracy.'
In fact, the US is rapidly
degenerating into a police state and a worse dystopia
than George Orwell imagined in his book,
1984.
John W. Whitehead describes below the prison that is
being constructed for all of us.
This prison is the work of
many of our fellow citizens including scientists and
entrepreneurs who have gained fame and fortune creating
a prison for mankind.
What were they thinking as
they threw their energy and their lives into
constructing a police state dystopia?
Paul Craig Roberts

"It's a future where you don't forget
anything
In this new future you're never lost
We will know your position
down to the foot and down to the inch over time
Your car will drive itself, it's a bug that
cars were invented before computers
you're never lonely
you're never
bored
you're never out of ideas
We can suggest where you go next, who
to meet, what to read...
What's interesting about this future is that
it's for the average person, not just the elites."
Google CEO Eric Schmidt on his vision
of the future
Time to buckle up your seatbelts, folks. You're
in for a bumpy ride.
We're hurtling down a one-way road toward the
Police State at mind-boggling speeds, the terrain is getting more
treacherous by the minute, and we've passed all the exit ramps.
From this point forward, there is no turning
back, and the signpost ahead reads "Danger."
Indeed, as I document in
A Government of Wolves - The Emerging American Police
State, we're about to enter a Twilight Zone of sorts,
one marked by,
drones, smart phones, GPS devices, smart
TVs, social media, smart meters, surveillance cameras, facial
recognition software, online banking, license plate readers and
driverless cars,
...all part of the interconnected technological
spider's web that is life in the American police state, and every new gadget
pulls us that much deeper into the sticky snare.
In this
Brave New World awaiting us, there will be
no communication not spied upon, no movement untracked, no thought unheard.
In other words, there will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.
We're on the losing end of a technological
revolution that has already taken hostage our computers, our phones, our
finances, our entertainment, our shopping, our appliances, and now, it's
focused its sights on our cars.
As if the government wasn't already able to
track our movements on the nation's highways and byways by way of
satellites, GPS devices, and real-time traffic cameras, government officials
are now pushing to require that all new vehicles come installed with black
box recorders and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, ostensibly to
help prevent crashes.
Yet strip away the glib Orwellian doublespeak,
and what you will find is that these black boxes and V2V transmitters, which
will not only track a variety of data, including speed, direction, location,
the number of miles traveled, and seatbelt use, but will also transmit
this data to other drivers, including the police, are little more
than Trojan Horses, stealth attacks on our last shreds of privacy, sold to
us as safety measures for the sake of the greater good, all the while poised
to wreak havoc on our lives.
Black boxes and V2V transmitters are just the
tip of the iceberg, though.
The 2015 Corvette Stingray will be outfitted
with a performance data recorder which,
"uses a camera mounted on the windshield and
a global positioning receiver to record speed, gear selection and brake
force," but also provides a recording of the driver's point of view as
well as recording noises made inside the car.
As journalist Jaclyn Trop reports for the
New York Times,
"Drivers can barely make a left turn, put on
their seatbelts or push 80 miles an hour without their actions somehow,
somewhere being tracked or recorded."
Indeed, as Jim Farley, Vice President of
Marketing and Sales for Ford Motor Company all but admitted, corporations
and government officials already have a pretty good sense of where you are
at all times:
"We know everyone who breaks the law, we
know when you're doing it. We have GPS in your car, so we know what
you're doing."
Now that the government and its corporate
partners-in-crime know where you're going and how fast
you're going when in your car, the next big hurdle will be to know,
-
how many passengers are in your car,
-
what contraband might be in your car
(and that will largely depend on whatever is outlawed at the moment,
which could be anything from Sudafed cold medicine to goat cheese)
-
what you're saying and exactly what
you're doing within the fiberglass and steel walls of your vehicle
That's where drones come in.
Once drones take to the skies en masse in 2015,
there will literally be no place where government agencies and private
companies cannot track your movements. These drones will be equipped with
cameras that provide a live video feed, as well as heat sensors, radar and
thermal imaging devices capable of seeing through the walls of your car.
Some will be capable of peering at figures from
20,000 feet up and 25 miles away.
They will be outfitted with infrared cameras and
radar which will pierce through the darkness. They can also keep track of 65
persons of interest at once. Some drones are already capable of hijacking
Wi-Fi networks and intercepting electronic communications such as text
messages.
The Army has developed drones with facial
recognition software, as well as drones that can complete a target-and-kill
mission without any human instruction or interaction.
These are the ultimate killing and spying
machines. There will also be drones armed with "less-lethal" weaponry,
including bean bag guns and tasers.
And of course all of this information, your
every movement - whether you make a wrong move, or appear to be doing
something suspicious, even if you don't do anything suspicious, the
information of your whereabouts, including what stores and offices you
visit, what political rallies you attend, and what people you meet - will be
tracked, recorded and streamed to a government command center, where it will
be saved and easily accessed at a later date.
By the time you add self-driving cars into the
futuristic mix, equipped with computers that know where you want to go
before you do, you'll be so far down the road to Steven Spielberg's
vision of the future as depicted in
Minority Report
that privacy and autonomy will be little more than distant mirages in
your rearview mirror.
The film, set in 2054 and based on a short story
by Philip K. Dick, offered movie audiences a special effect-laden
techno-vision of a futuristic world in which the government is all-seeing,
all-knowing and all-powerful. And if you dare to step out of line, dark-clad
police SWAT teams will bring you under control.
Mind you, while critics were dazzled by the
technological wonders displayed in Minority Report, few dared to
consider the consequences of a world in which Big Brother is, literally and
figuratively, in the driver's seat. Even the driverless cars in Minority
Report answer to the government's (and its corporate cohorts') bidding.
Likewise, we are no longer autonomous in our own
cars. Rather, we are captive passengers being chauffeured about by a robotic
mind which answers to the government and its corporate henchmen.
Soon it won't even matter whether we are seated
behind the wheel of our own vehicles, because it will be advertisers and
government agents calling the shots.
Case in point:
devices are now being developed for European
cars that would allow police to stop a car remotely, ostensibly to end
police chases.
Google is partnering with car manufacturers in
order to integrate apps and other Smartphone-like technology into vehicles,
in order to alert drivers to deals and offers at nearby businesses.
As Patrick Lin, professor of Stanford's
School of Engineering, warns, in a world where third-party advertisers and
data collectors control a good deal of the content we see on a daily basis,
we may one day literally be driven to businesses not because we wanted to go
there, but because someone paid for us to be taken there.
Rod Serling, creator of the beloved
Sci-Fi series Twilight Zone and one of the most insightful
commentators on human nature, once observed,
"We're developing a new citizenry. One that
will be very selective about cereals and automobiles, but won't be able
to think."
Indeed, not only are we developing a new
citizenry incapable of thinking for themselves, we're also instilling in
them a complete and utter reliance on the government and its corporate
partners to do everything for them - tell them,
-
what to eat
-
what to wear
-
how to think
-
what to believe
-
how long to sleep
-
who to vote for
-
whom to associate with,
...and on and on.
In this way, we have created a welfare state, a
nanny state, a police state, a surveillance state, an electronic
concentration camp - call it what you will, the meaning is the same:
in our quest for less personal
responsibility, a greater sense of security, and no burdensome
obligations to each other or to future generations, we have created a
society in which we have no true freedom.
Pandora's Box has been opened and there's no way
to close it.
As Rod Serling prophesied in a Commencement
Address at the University of Southern California in March 17, 1970:
"It's simply a national acknowledgement that
in any kind of priority, the needs of human beings must come first.
Poverty is here and now. Hunger is here and now. Racial tension is here
and now. Pollution is here and now.
These are the things that scream for a
response. And if we don't listen to that scream - and if we don't
respond to it - we may well wind up sitting amidst our own rubble,
looking for the truck that hit us - or the bomb that pulverized us.
Get the license number of whatever it was
that destroyed the dream. And I think we will find that the vehicle was
registered in our own name."
You can add the following to that list of needs
requiring an urgent response:
-
Police abuse is here and now.
-
Surveillance is here and now.
-
Imperial government is here and now.
Yet while the vehicle bearing down upon us is
indeed registered in our own name,
we've allowed Big Brother to get behind the wheel, and there's no
way to put the brakes on this runaway car.
