Over one million North American Satanists are seeking refuge outside of
North America sources with direct access to a former US president, a source
close to
David Rockefeller and a member of the
Japanese cabinet say.
The reason they are seeking a refuge is that
they fear the reaction of the American people when they find out what was
done to them. So far the Japanese, Philippine and Israeli governments have
all refused to give the Satanists shelter.
The Satanists are mostly but not exclusively of
Khazarian descent but they pretend to be Jews,
Christians and Moslems in order to hide their affiliation. The
Satanists are the people who were participating in the plot to enslave
humanity.
The US military and intelligence agencies, as well as the enraged US
public are in the process of forcing the corrupt Washington politicians to
audit the Federal Reserve Board. When this happens the investigative trail
will lead to the horrific story of how Americans were slowly, slowly
enslaved during the 20th century by these Satan worshippers.
Once they got control of the right to print money in 1916, they immediately
started to buy up all the newspapers, then the radio stations, the TV
stations, the movie industry and trade journals. Their biggest coup was to
take over the text book publishing industry in order to be able to brainwash
generations of children.
They then took over most of industry, the various professional
organizations, the Washington establishment, the medical establishment and
much of the court system as well.
Here
is a link to the confessions of one Satan worshipper that
is well worth reading though very disturbing.
The Hidden Tyranny
Their plan was to kill at least 4 billion people and permanently enslave the
rest of humanity.
There is so much evidence for this now that only
the fools still relying on Satanic corporate propaganda do not realize it
yet. The plan involved a fake alien invasion, germ warfare, starvation,
atomic war and artificially generated disasters like tsunamis and
earthquakes.
There are now enough whistleblowers and evidence to show they engaged in
human sacrifice, pedophilia and enslavement of children.
The extent of this problem may be so bad that many good hearted people will
react with denial and horror. According to the US Justice Department
797,500 children go missing every year in
the United States.
Of these 203,900 are abducted by family members
and 148,000 are found and returned to their families.
That means close to 450,000 children go
missing in the US every year.
That is well over ten times the rate children go
missing in Japan or South Korea. Even if you assume there are runaways who
never contact their families again, there is a vast and growing pool of
evidence that many of these children have been killed or turned into sex
slaves by the Satanists.
They were also responsible for
World Wars,
genocide and the impoverishment of large swathes of humanity during the 20th
century.
Of course when they start auditing the Federal Reserve Board the
investigation will not immediately uncover all of this.
Instead they will be concentrating on locating all the money and property
stolen from the American people by the owners of the Federal Reserve Board,
according to my sources. The plan is to use the money to pay back US
external debt.
The entire TARP exercise and the Lehman shock, were really a case of the
Chinese, Russians and others demanding the Federal Reserve Board pay the
money they owed to them. They did this by passing a bill to steal from the
American people rather than pay out of their own pocket. Unfortunately for
them this brazen act meant their cover was going to be blown.
My family is one of the greatest victims of the Satanic Federal Reserve
Board. My great grandfather was the largest holder of General Electric
shares and was getting ready to buy General Motors when he died in a
suspicious car accident.
His son in law, the Sheriff of Brockville Ontario died shortly afterwards.
The Fulford GE shares were then taken by a corrupt trust fund and ended up
in the hands of the Rockefellers. Almost all American families have suffered
similar losses, if not necessarily on the same scale.
The Satanists, of course, do not plan to slink off quietly into the night
and will try everything they can to prevent their exposure.
Fortunately for the American people,
...have now reached a consensus that they will
take no military action against the American people on behalf of the
Satanists.
Instead, the plan is to decapitate the snake by confiscating the
fortunes stolen by the Satanists. One of them,
Henry
Kissinger, was recently stopped from leaving the country with
two large suitcases filled with cash. He is now a very scared man as well he
should be.
It is very unlikely the one million Satanists will find any refuge on this
planet so it will probably be up to the American people to deal with them.
The best solution would probably be the arrest of their leaders and the
re-education of the rest of them.
All of this information is not going to be known to the general public for a
while yet.
However, for those who are outside of the
system, we see a slow motion train wreck in progress that nothing is
going to stop. The participation of 40% of the Greek population in
anti-bank demonstrations is just an early indicator of what is to come.
There will be revolution throughout the West against all dishonest
bankgsters.
Finally, we are once again hearing that vast amounts of funding will soon be
made available to humanity.
There is much we cannot disclose in order to
prevent
Federal Reserve Board sabotage but we
remain optimistic. Although many deadlines have come and gone, it is
mathematically impossible for the Feds to dig themselves out of the hole
they are now in.
Finally, remember it is not over until it is over so keep alert and focus on
what is closest and most important to you as the storm approaches its
climax.
