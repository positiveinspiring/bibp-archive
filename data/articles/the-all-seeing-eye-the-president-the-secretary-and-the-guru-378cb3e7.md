Wallace's reasons for wanting to
introduce the Great Seal onto the American currency were based on
his belief that America was reaching a turning point in her history
and that great spiritual changes were imminent.
He believed that the 1930s represented a
time when a great spiritual awakening was going to take place which
would precede the creation of the one-world state.

The Occult Conspiracy, p.95
Reverse of the Great Seal:
All Seeing Eye
If you live in the United States of America,
then from the time you become conscious of money, the Great Seal
becomes a part of your psyche - whether you realize it or not. Moreover,
since U.S. dollars are, in effect, standard international currency, this
Great Seal infiltrates the minds of men the world over - both free and bond.
The centerpiece of this mandala is the All-Seeing Eye - an
important symbol within freemasonry and rosicrucian traditions for
hundreds of years.
So it is not surprising to find pride among
occultists who understand the significance of this emblem:
Our beautiful seal is an expression of
Freemasonry, an expression of occult ideas.
(Wyckoff, H. S. The Great American Seal.
The Mystic Light, the Rosicrucian Magazine, p.56)
1
The first attempts at including the
All-Seeing Eye on the seal were not successful. The first die of the
Great Seal was cut from brass in 1782. In 1825, 1841, 1877, 1885, and 1902,
new dies were cut, but each time the reverse went uncut and unused... the
Illuminati's plan for the
New World Order had not been advanced far
enough, yet, to be announced.
The New World Order is an expression that has been used by
illuminized Freemasonry since the days of
Weishaupt to signify the coming world
government.
It is necessary to establish a universal
regime over the whole world, Weishaupt had said.
(Writings of the Illuminati, 1780)
During the first part of the 20th century and up
to the time the reverse of the seal was first used, a series of victories
over the sovereignty of the United States had already been won.
Illuminist agents committed to the one-world
interests of the
Rothschild-Warburg-Rockefeller
cartel had accomplished some important stepping stones to this
New
World Order:
-
Federal Reserve System (1913)
-
League of Nations (1920)
-
Royal Institute of International
Affairs, and Council on Foreign Relations (1920-21)
-
the Stock Market Crash of 1929
The consolidation of power was complete and the
reverse side of the seal, which remained largely unknown to the American
people for more than 150 years, could now be placed.
The Intervention by
the Masonic-Rosicrucian-Illuminati
In 1934, Secretary of Agriculture, soon-to-be Vice-President (1940-44) and
32nd degree freemason Henry Wallace submitted a proposal to the
president to mint a coin depicting the seal's obverse and reverse. President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, also a 32nd degree freemason, liked the idea
but opted to instead place it on the dollar bill.
According to Henry Wallace, in a letter dated
February 6, 1951,
the Latin phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum
impressed me as meaning the 'New Deal' of the Ages.
Roosevelt as he looked at the colored reproduction of the Seal was
first struck with the representation of the 'All-Seeing Eye,' a Masonic
representation of Great Architect the Universe. Next he was impressed
with the idea that the foundation for the new order of the ages had been
laid in 1776 (May 1st, 1776, founding of the Illuminati) but would be
completed only under the eye of the Great Architect. Roosevelt like
myself was a 32nd degree Mason. He suggested that the Seal be put on the
dollar bill rather that a coin.
Besides being a high ranking freemason and
having the distinction of introducing socialism into the American political
system, Roosevelt was a member of a secret society called the Ancient
Arabic Order of Nobles of the Mystics Shrine (Shriners), attaining the
grade of a Knight of Pythias.
The Order of Nobles and Mystics claimed to be an
offshoot of the Illuminati.
Freemasons, Walter Flemming and William Florence founded an
American branch in New York, 1872. Membership in the order was open only to
Freemasons who had reached the 32nd degree of the Ancient and Accepted
Scottish Rite or those who've attained the last degree of the York Rite, the
thirteenth degree (Knight Templar).
The Order of Nobles and Mystics have origins which date back to the
seventh century - apparently founded by a descendent of Mohammed.
Author Michael Howard describes the
Order's symbols.
Symbol
of the Order
The symbol of the Order is a crescent moon,
made from the claws of a Bengal tiger, engraved with a pyramid, an urn
and a pentagram. The crescent is suspended from a scimitar and in the
Order is a representation of the Universal Mother worshipped in ancient
times as Isis.
The horns of the crescent point downwards
because it represents the setting moon of the old faith at the rising of
the Sun of the new religion of the brotherhood of humanity.
- The Occult Conspiracy, p.93
According to Anton LaVey, founder of the
Church of Satan, Roosevelt's Shriner's have
a ritual similar to a satanic ritual called "The Ceremony of the Stifling
Air", or better known as "L'air Epais."
LaVey says that this rite was originally
performed "when entering the sixth degree of the Order of the Knights
Templar." Remember that if the Masonic candidate chooses to follow the
York Rite, after he completes the 13th degree called the Knight
Templar, he can apply to become a Shriner.
LaVey describes the Templars' ritual thus:
The original Templars' rite of the Fifth
degree symbolically guided the candidate through the Devil's Pass in the
mountains separating the East from the West (the Yezidi domain). At the
fork of the trail the candidate would make an important decision: either
to retain his present identity, or strike out on the Left-Hand Path
to Shambhala, where he might dwell in Satan's household, having
rejected the foibles and hypocrisies of the everyday world.
A striking parallel to this rite is enacted within the mosques of the
Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, an order
reserved for thirty-second degree Masons. The Nobles have gracefully
removed themselves from any implication of heresy by referring to the
place beyond the Devil's Pass as the domain where they might "worship
at the shrine of Islam."
Once the celebrant has taken this degree, he embarks upon the Left Hand
Path and chooses Hell in place of Heaven.

Pretty powerful stuff for sure, and not what you
would expect of the "merry old men" wearing "fez-hats" and tending to burn
victims!
One part of LaVey's interpretation I find
interesting is the choice the candidate makes in following the "Left-Hand
Path to Shambhala." 2
In esoteric doctrine the principle city of the
underground world is
Shambhala. In this subterranean kingdom
presides an all-powerful and All-Seeing ruler - The King of the
World.
Some have called him Sanat Kumara 3,
others, King Satan. This may not be as far fetched as it seems. The Bible
clearly states that Satan is the "prince" and "lord" of this world - John
12: 31 & 14: 30, Eph. 6: 12, Luke 4: 6-7, and 2 Cor. 4: 4 - and in fact has
dominion over this fallen world.
This King of the World, according to
Eastern tradition, has a rule and influence which stretches to the surface
by means of trusted emissaries who carry out specific tasks and duties -
including a secret 8 million who carry out his tasks unbeknownst to us all.

As we shall see, one such "emissary" had a
considerable influence with Roosevelt's Secretary of Agriculture.
Wallace's Occult
Connections
Many of Henry Wallace's ideas originated with his guru, the Russian mystic
and artist
Nicholas Roerich. He was an
adventurer/occultist in the tradition of Madame Blavatsky,
Aleister
Crowley and G.I. Gurdjieff.
Roerich spent many years traveling through Nepal
and Tibet studying with the lamas in the Buddhist monasteries of those
countries. Roerich was searching for the lost city of Shambhala.
In esoteric circles Shambhala is the home
of the Ascended Masters, Secret Chiefs, or the
Great White Brotherhood - the hidden
hand behind the formation and guidance of:
Both Wallace and Roerich were members of the
Theosophical Society, this is how Wallace met his Master.
Roerich seems to have been an emissary of sorts for the Great White
Brotherhood - even bringing a mysterious stone to guide the League of
Nations on behalf of the Masters. According to legend, the 'Chintamani
Stone' was believed to be a part of a magical meteorite
from a solar system in
the Orion constellation. This Chintamani
Stone is sent wherever a spiritual mission vital to humanity is set up, and
is returned when that mission is completed. 5
A mysterious stone was indeed mentioned by Wallace in one of his typical
'Dear Guru' letters to Roerich:
And I have thought of the admonition 'Await
the Stone.' We await the Stone and we welcome you again to this glorious
land of destiny. 6
Not surprisingly, occultists regard Roerich as
the guiding hand behind the placement of America's Great Seal and the
All-Seeing Eye, and matter-of-factly state that it was at Roerich's
insistence that Wallace approach Roosevelt about finally printing the
All-Seeing Eye on the dollar bill.
Henry Wallace was well versed in occult knowledge himself.
In a letter to Roerich he stated,
the search - whether it be for the lost
word of Masonry, or the Holy Chalice, or the potentialities of the age
to come - is the one supremely worthwhile objective. All else is karmic
duty. But surely everyone is a potential Galahad? So may we strive for
the Chalice and the flame above it.
The chalice he refers to, according to
Michael Howard, is the Holy Grail, regarded by the Rosicrucians
as a feminine symbol for perfection, and 'the age to come' is the dawning of
the Aquarian Age. This I agree with, and further, "the age to come" is
synonymous with Aleister Crowley's "New Age of Horus" - a Roerich
occult contemporary.
It seems that Novus Ordo Seclorum and
Annuit Coeptis (he has blessed our beginning) has even deeper occult
meanings than we're led to believe.
Illuminist Conspiracy?
Well, yes!
These three "wise men" - by placing the reverse
of the Great Seal on the dollar bill - succeeded in announcing to the world
that America is on "the path", and is the world's best hope for the
spiritual (occult) evolution of the planet.
Considering how deep into the occult both
Roosevelt and Wallace were already - and Wallace's connections to Theosophy
- they had to of known that the most esteemed Theosophist of her time,
Alice Bailey, had already declared that the Aquarian Age
had begun in 1932. The whole symbology of the reverse is meant to be a
mandala announcing this "New Age of Horus."
They could not help but see the significance of
this. And giving that their fellow illuminists in
the
Federal Reserve had now taken control of America's currency, it
was a shoo-in.
As for Roerich, he was only doing the Hierarchy's bidding for he was also a
channeler of the Ascended Master
El Morya - a major avatar in the pantheon
of Theosophy. Roerich, after his death, apparently succeeded in joining the
Hierarchy, and has now become the occult equivalent of a catholic saint
himself - an "Ascended Master."
His messages are now channeled by Elizabeth
Clare Prophet and one such message was "received", ironically enough, on
October 28, 1990 at The Roosevelt Hotel.
Symbolism is the language of the
Mysteries... By symbols men have ever sought to communicate to each
other those thoughts which transcend the limitations of language.
Rejecting man-conceived dialects as inadequate and unworthy to
perpetuate divine ideas, the Mysteries thus chose symbolism as a far
more ingenious and ideal method of preserving their transcendental
knowledge.
In a single figure a symbol may both reveal
and conceal, for to the wise the subject of the symbol is obvious, while
to the ignorant the figure remains inscrutable. Hence, he who seeks to
unveil the secret doctrine of antiquity must search for that doctrine
not upon the open pages of books which might fall into the hands of the
unworthy but in the place where it was originally concealed.
Manly P. Hall,
The Secret Teachings of All Ages, p. 20
These considerations lead us to an interesting topic, the Eye of Mind
or the Eye of Horus... and conveying the idea of the 'All seeing Eye'.
The end set before the Egyptian neophyte was illumination, that is to be
'brought to light'. The Religion of Egypt was the Religion of the
Light.
- Thomas Milton Stewart, Symbolism
of the Gods of the Egyptians and The Light They Throw on Freemasonry,
London, England, Baskerville Press, Ltd., 1927, p. 5
On the reverse of our nation's Great Seal is an unfinished pyramid to
represent human society itself, imperfect and incomplete. Above floats
the symbol of the esoteric orders, the radiant triangle with its
all-seeing eye... There is only one possible origin for these symbols,
and that is the secret societies which came to this country 150 years
before the Revolutionary War... There can be no question that the great
seal was directly inspired by these orders of the human Quest, and that
it set forth the purpose for this nation...

Destiny of America, pp. 174, 181.
End Notes
-
The Wyckoff quote was reproduced on page
59 of Robert Hieronimus' America's Secret Destiny: Spiritual Vision
& the Foundation of a Nation.
Dr. Robert R. Hieronimus is the world's foremost authority on the
reverse of the Great Seal. In October 1981 he received a doctorate
for his work on the history and meaning of the Great Seal: An
Historical Analysis of the Reverse of the American Great Seal and
Its Relationship to the Ideology of Humanistic Psychology.
Much of the material in his PhD dissertation is reproduced in
America's Secret Destiny. Having researched a wide array of
occult/esoteric literature and studying the Rosicrucian/Freemasonic
views of the American forefathers, he comes to the conclusion that
the Great Seal is an initiatory mandala, in part, for the
purpose of "national and global transformation."

Sanat Kumara was made popular by
the channelings of
Alice Bailey. The origin stems from
Hinduism, where Sanat Kumara is revered as one of the four or seven
sons of Brahma.

Many stories about
Shambhala and the "King of the
World" circulated widely in Theosophical circles around the turn of
the 20th century. A great deal of this material is reproduced on the
web, as well: In Search of Shambhala, An Excerpt From - Beasts, Men
and Gods and Mystery of Shambhala with an account of Nicholas
Roerich's involvement.

The Black stone of the Ka'aba of
Mecca and that of the Ancient Shrine of Cybele, the goddess
mother of the Near East are both believed by some occultists to
be pieces of the magical meteorite (called the Chintamani
Stone) which is alleged to have come from a solar system in
the constellation Orion, probably Sirius...according to Lamaist
lore, a fragment of this stone...is sent wherever a spiritual
mission vital to humanity is set up, and is returned when that
mission is completed. Such a stone was said to be in possession
of the failed League of Nations, it's return being entrusted to
[Nicholas] Roerich.

The famous "Dear Guru" letters fell into
the hands of Wallace's political foes. They were kept secret in 1940
when he ran as Vice President for Roosevelt's third term in office.
But in 1948, when Wallace ran for president as candidate of the
newly formed Progressive Party, the letters were leaked to the
press. See American Dreamer: A Life of Henry A. Wallace for a
thorough study on the controversial, and often perplexing, man.
The Occult Meaning of
the All-Seeing Eye
Lieutenant
C.A.L. Totten, to Secretary of
Treasury Charles J. Folger, on February 10, 1882:
The All-Seeing Eye is one of the oldest
hieroglyphics of the Deity. The triangle also is a cabalistic symbol
of the most remote antiquity...
The descent of the mystic eye and triangle in the form of a capstone
to this mysterious monument [the Great Pyramid of Gizeh] of all
times and nations, is to us as a people most pregnant with
significance. The motto, Novus Ordo Seclorum, is a quotation from
the 4th Ecologue and was borrowed in turn by Virgil from the mystic
Sylbylline records.
The entire quotation is as follows: Novus Ordo Seclorum altered
from Magnus Soeclorum Ordo, a mighty order of the ages born anew.
Both the prophetic Virgin and Saturnian kingdoms now return. Now a
new progeny is let down from the heavens. Favor, chaste Lucina, the
boy soon to be born in whom the iron age shall come to an end, and
the golden one shall arise again in the whole earth.

...the All-Seeing Eye, ...to the Egyptian
initiates was the emblem of Osiris, the Creator.
... His [Osiris] power was symbolized by an Eye over a Sceptre. The Sun
was termed by the Greeks the Eye of Jupiter, and the Eye of the World;
and his is the All-Seeing Eye in our Lodges.

Known as the 'Eye of Horus' or 'Utchat Eye', it is associated with both
the Egyptian God Horus and his father Osiris.

Called the 'mal ochio' (evil eye), this object is regarded by all
Satanists as the symbol of Lucifer.

Spencer Whited Sepulchers, p. 20
The Serpent promised Adam and Eve that their eyes would 'be opened' if
they ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The key
word in this passage is eyes, which in Hebrew can be translated
'knowledge.' Opened can be translated 'broadened.' What the Serpent
promised Adam and Eve was that knowledge would be broadened if they ate
of the forbidden fruit.
But the most foreboding aspect of this
scripture emerges from the fact that the Hebrew word for 'eyes' is not
plural, but singular. What the Serpent actually told Adam and Eve was
that their 'eye' would be broadened by knowledge. The 'eye' that
Scripture wants us to consider is not the physical organ of sight, but
the eye of the mind or the soul.
This singular 'eye' is called the 'third
eye' of clairvoyance in the Hindu religion, the eye of Osiris in Egypt,
and the All-Seeing Eye in Freemasonry.

Beast: A History of the War Between English and French Freemasonry, Vol.
III, pp. 6-7 (Source: Misc Study - The All-Seeing Eye)
Many modern groups, though not related...claim to be offshoots of the
original so-called Mystery Religion. They all carry the same symbols,
such as the All-Seeing Eye, and believe in the same so-called Secret
Doctrine. The symbol may represent a god, but it is not the God of the
Bible. It is a human eye indicating that man is god.

Grail: And the Men Who Plan to Rule the World, p. 165
...the phrase so often employed, `the All-Seeing Eye.' This refers to
the planetary Logos to see all parts, aspects and phases (in time and
space) of his planetary vehicle,...

Bailey's "planetary Logos" is a satanic trinity, the scheme is as
follows,
-
Shamballa: Ruler - Sanat (Satan) Kumara
-
Hierarchy: Ruler - The [Anti] Christ

Humanity: Ruler - Lucifer
The eye of Shiva - the All-Seeing Eye, the
eye which directs the will and purposes of Deity.

Roerich knew what he was doing as the symbol represents the spiritual
future of the United States of America. The 'All-Seeing Eye' signifies
the Spiritual Hierarchy of Light, the 'Silent Watchers' over humanity's
spiritual development.
The Secrets Of The Great Pyramid
It is through the medium of this 'all-seeing eye' that the Adept can at
any moment put Himself in touch with His disciples anywhere; that He can
communicate with His compeers on the planet, and on the third planet
which, with ours, forms a triangle...

One of the four Lipka Lords, Who stand nearest to our planetary Logos,
is called 'The Living Serpent,' and His emblem is a serpent of blue with

Shiva' which sees and knows all...
