# Ex-Bush Official Willing to Testify - Bush, Cheney Knew Gitmo Prisoners 
Innocent

Former Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld once declared that individuals captured by the US
military in the aftermath of 9/11 and shipped off to the Guantanamo
Bay prison facility represented the "worst of the worst."
During a radio interview in June 2005,
Rumsfeld said the detainees at Guantanamo,
"all of whom were captured on a
battlefield," are "terrorists, trainers, bomb makers,
recruiters, financiers, [Osama Bin Laden's] body guards,
would-be suicide bombers, probably the 20th hijacker, 9/11
hijacker."
Listen to Truthout's Jason Leopold
discuss this story on The Peter B. Collins show:
But Rumsfeld knowingly lied, according
to a former top Bush administration official.
And so did then Vice President
Dick
Cheney when he said, also in 2002 and in dozens of public statements
thereafter, that Guantanamo prisoners,
"are the worst of a very bad
lot" and "dangerous" and "devoted to killing millions of Americans,
innocent Americans, if they can, and they are perfectly prepared to
die in the effort."
Now, in a
sworn declaration obtained exclusively by Truthout, Col.
Lawrence Wilkerson, who was chief of staff to former Secretary of
State Colin Powell during
George W. Bush's first term in office,
said,
Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld knew the "vast majority" of
prisoners captured in the so-called
War on Terror were innocent,
...and
the administration refused to set them free once those facts were
established because of the political repercussions that would have
ensued.
"By late August 2002, I found that of
the initial 742 detainees that had arrived at Guantánamo, the
majority of them had never seen a US soldier in the process of their
initial detention and their captivity had not been subjected to any
meaningful review," Wilkerson's declaration says.
"Secretary Powell
was also trying to bring pressure to bear regarding a number of
specific detentions because children as young as 12 and 13 and
elderly as old as 92 or 93 had been shipped to Guantánamo. By that
time, I also understood that the deliberate choice to send detainees
to Guantánamo was an attempt to place them outside the jurisdiction
of the US legal system."
He added that it became,
"more and more
clear many of the men were innocent, or at a minimum their guilt was
impossible to determine let alone prove in any court of law,
civilian or military."
For Cheney and Rumsfeld, and "others,"
Wilkerson said,
"the primary issue was to gain more intelligence as
quickly as possible, both on Al Qaeda and its current and future
plans and operations but increasingly also, in 2002-2003, on
contacts between Al Qaeda and Saddam Husseins intelligence and
secret police forces in Iraq."
"Their view was that innocent people
languishing in Guantánamo for years was justified by the broader war
on terror and the capture of the small number of terrorists who were
responsible for
the September 11 attacks, or other acts of
terrorism," Wilkerson added.
"Moreover, their detention was deemed
acceptable if it led to a more complete and satisfactory
intelligence picture with regard to Iraq, thus justifying the
Administrations plans for war with that country."
Documents have been released over the
past year that showed how in 2002 several high-value detainees were
tortured and forced to make statements that linked Iraq to al-Qaeda
and 9/11, which the Bush administration cited as intelligence to
support its invasion of the country in March 2003.
But the
confessions were utterly false.
Wilkerson's declaration was made in
support of a
lawsuit filed by
Adel Hassan Hamad, a 52-year-old former
Guantanamo detainee who is suing Defense Secretary Robert Gates,
former Joint Chief of Staff Richard Myers, and a slew of other Bush
administration officials for wrongfully imprisoning and torturing
him.
Hamad was arrested in his apartment in
Pakistan in July 2002, rendered to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan
for three months, where he says he was tortured, and then
transferred to Guantanamo, where he was interrogated daily and
subjected to even more torture by US military personnel.
At Bagram, according to Hamad's lawsuit,
"dogs were set upon [him] while watching United States military
personnel laughed and mocked him."
Moreover, he was forced to stand
for three days without "sleep or food" and eventually collapsed.
He
was then sent to a hospital where it took him two weeks to recover.
"Mr. Hamad was not given notice of the
basis for his detention until more than two years after first being
detained, when a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) was
convened in November 2004," according to the lawsuit, filed in US
District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle
earlier this week.
"Not until March 2005, nearly three full years
after initially being detained, was Mr. Hamad officially labeled an
'enemy Combatant' by the flawed CSRT process," according to the
lawsuit.
"However, this determination drew a rare
dissenting opinion that acknowledged his enemy combatant status
determination was unwarranted and, as such, would have
'unconscionable results,'" the lawsuit states.
"The basis for Mr. Hamad's enemy combatant determination was simply because of his
association as an employee of two organizations for whom he had done
humanitarian and charity work (one of which he had left years
before), and nothing more."
"In fact, a second CSRT was ordered for
Mr. Hamad in November of 2007, one month before he was ultimately
released to the Sudan. This was unusual, and indicates that the
government recognized that the initial CSRT determination of Mr.
Hamad was not accurate."
While Hamad was detained, his wife gave
birth to a daughter who died some time later because the family did
not have any money to pay for medical care. He has five other
children.
Since he has been released, Hamad says
he suffers from emotional, physical and psychological injuries and
he is seeking undisclosed compensatory and punitive damages.
Similar
lawsuits against former Bush administration officials, however, have
been dismissed in other jurisdictions.
Wilkerson said he,
"made a personal
choice to come forward and discuss the abuses that occurred because
knowledge that I served in an Administration that tortured and
abused those it detained at the facilities at Guantánamo Bay and
elsewhere and indefinitely detained the innocent for political
reasons has marked a low point in my professional career and I wish
to make the record clear on what occurred."
"I am also extremely concerned that the
Armed Forces of the United States, where I spent 31 years of my
professional life, were deeply involved in these tragic mistakes. I
am willing to testify in person regarding the content of this
declaration, should that be necessary," he added.
Gwynne Skinner, an assistant professor
of clinical law at Willamette University College of Law in Salem,
Oregon and a member of Hamad's legal team, said Wilkerson's
declaration was originally intended to be filed in support of
Hamad's habeas corpus case, which was still pending in federal court
in Washington, DC, along with more than 100 others, even though
Hamad and the other former Guantanamo prisoners have already been
released.
But US District Court Judge Thomas Hogan
dismissed the cases, stating the former prisoners' transfers
rendered their habeas lawsuits moot.
Attorneys for the detainees
were upset because they had hoped the court would make a decision
that would ultimately clear the petitioners' names, lift travel
restrictions, and the stigma that comes from being detained at
Guantanamo.
Still, Skinner said Wilkerson's
declaration is significant because it marks the first time a Bush
administration official is willing to state, under oath, that
Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and others knew many of the prisoners were
innocent when they were sent to Guantanamo.
Wilkerson said detainees like Hamad were
of little concern to Cheney.
The Office of Vice President
Dick Cheney,
"had absolutely no concern that the vast majority of Guantanamo
detainees were innocent, or that there was a lack of any useable
evidence for the great majority of them," Wilkerson said in the
9-page declaration.
Cheney's position, Wilkerson asserted,
"could be
summed up as 'the end justifies the means'."
Cheney, and his daughter Liz, have been
vocal critics of President Obama's efforts to shut down Guantanamo.
Obama signed an executive order immediately after he was sworn into
office and set a one-year deadline to close the facility. But he
missed the date, due in part, to Congress' refusal to earmark funds
that would have allowed the administration to close the prison and
move some detainees to a supermax prison in Illinois.
Cheney
said last year
that the only alternative the Bush administration had to setting up
Guantanamo was to kill the prisoners detained there.
"If you don't have a place where you can
hold these people, the only other option is to kill them, and we
don't operate that way," Cheney said.
It is not news that the majority of the
initial 742 prisoners who were detained at Guantanamo were innocent
of the crimes that they were accused of.
Indeed, in February of 2006, the
National Journal reviewed the case files of 132 prisoners who filed
habeas corpus petitions and the redacted CSRT transcripts of 314
others and concluded that,
"most of the 'enemy combatants' held at
Guantanamo... are simply not the worst of the worst of the terrorist
world" as Cheney, Rumsfeld and Bush had claimed.
"Many of them are not accused of
hostilities against the United States or its allies," according to
an
investigative report published by the National Journal.
"Most,
when captured, were innocent of any terrorist activity, were Taliban
foot soldiers at worst, and were often far less than that. And some,
perhaps many, are guilty only of being foreigners in Afghanistan or
Pakistan at the wrong time. And much of the evidence - even the
classified evidence - gathered by the Defense Department against
these men is flimsy, second-, third-, fourth- or 12th-hand.
It's
based largely on admissions by the detainees themselves or on
coerced, or worse, interrogations of their fellow inmates, some of
whom have been proved to be liars."
The Journal noted that a common thread
among many of the detainees is that a majority of them,
"were not
caught by American soldiers on the battlefield. They came into
American custody from third parties, mostly from Pakistan, some
after targeted raids there, most after a dragnet for Arabs after
9/11."
That's a point Wilkerson made in his
declaration and said it likely applied to Hamad's case as well.
"With respect to the assertions by Mr.
Hamad that he was wrongfully seized and detained, it became apparent
to me as early as August 2002, and probably earlier to other State
Department personnel who were focused on these issues, that many of
the prisoners detained at Guantanamo had been taken into custody
without regard to whether they were truly enemy combatants, or in
fact whether many of them were enemies at all," Wilkerson said in
his declaration.
"I soon realized from my conversations with
military colleagues as well as foreign service officers in the field
that many of the detainees were, in fact, victims of incompetent
battlefield vetting.
"There was no meaningful way to
determine whether they were terrorists, Taliban, or simply innocent
civilians picked up on a very confused battlefield or in the
territory of another state such as Pakistan. The vetting problem, in
my opinion, was directly related to the initial decision not to send
sufficient regular army troops at the outset of the war in
Afghanistan, and instead, to rely on the forces of the Northern
Alliance and the extremely few US Special Operations Forces (SOF)
who did not have the necessary training or personnel to deal with
battlefield detention questions or even the inclination to want to
deal with the issue.
"A related problem with the initial
detention was that predominantly US forces were not the ones who
were taking the prisoners in the first place. Instead, we relied
upon Afghans, such as General [Abdul Rashid] Dostums forces, and
upon Pakistanis, to hand over prisoners whom they had apprehended,
or who had been turned over to them for bounties, sometimes as much
as $5,000 per head.
"Such practices meant that the
likelihood was high that some of the Guantanamo detainees had been
turned in to US forces in order to settle local scores, for tribal
reasons, or just as a method of making money. I recall conversations
with serving military officers at the time, who told me that many
detainees were turned over for the wrong reasons, particularly for
bounties and other incentives."
In Hamad's case, Wilkerson said that he
has,
"no reason to believe that any more thorough process was used to
determine whether his seizure or transfer to Guantanamo was
justified."
Wilkerson said that he discussed the
Guantanamo detainees issue regularly with Powell and, based on those
discussions, Wilkerson discovered that,
"President Bush was involved
in all of the Guantanamo decision-making."
"My own view is that it was easy for
Vice President Cheney to run circles around President Bush
bureaucratically because Cheney had the network within the
government to do so," Wilkerson said.
"Moreover, by exploiting what
Secretary Powell called the presidents 'cowboy instincts,' Vice
President Cheney could more often than not gain the President's
acquiescence."
Wilkerson said issues revolving around
efforts to repatriate individuals wrongfully detained at Guantanamo
came up during the morning briefings chaired by Powell that he and
about 50 to 55 senior State Department officials attended beginning
in August 2002 after the prison facility was opened.
"At the briefing, Secretary Powell would
question Ambassador Pierre Prosper (Ambassador-at-Large for War
Crimes), Cofer Black (Coordinator for Counter Terrorism), and Beth
Jones (Assistant Secretary for Eurasia), or other senior personnel
for information about specific progress in negotiating detainee
releases," Wilkerson said.
"A number of these conversations arose
because Secretary Powell received frequent phone calls from British
Foreign Minister Jack Straw, who had consulted with Secretary Powell
frequently about repatriating the British Guantánamo detainees...
"I also know that several other foreign
ministers spoke with Secretary Powell urging him to repatriate their
countries' citizens. During these morning briefings, Secretary
Powell would express frustration that more progress had not been
made with detainee releases."
During one particular meeting, Wilkerson
said, Ambassador (Pierre-Richard)
Prosper, the point person on negotiating the
transfer of detainees to other countries,
"would discuss the
difficulty he encountered in dealing with the Department of Defense,
and specifically Donald Rumsfeld, who just refused to let detainees
go."
Wilkerson said it was "politically
impossible" to release detainees, even the ones Bush, Cheney,
Rumsfeld and other senior officials knew were innocent.
"The concern expressed was that if they
were released to another country, even an ally such as the United
Kingdom, the leadership of the Defense Department would be left
without any plausible explanation to the American people, whether
the released detainee was subsequently found to be innocent by the
receiving country, or whether the detainee was truly a terrorist
and, upon release were it to then occur, would return to the war
against the US," he said.
"Another concern was that the detention
efforts at Guantánamo would be revealed as the incredibly confused
operation that they were. Such results were not acceptable to the
Administration and would have been severely detrimental to the
leadership at DOD."
A spokesman for Rumsfeld said
Wilkerson's claims are untrue.
Peggy Cifrino, Powell's spokeswoman,
said the former Secretary of State,
"has not seen Colonel
Wilkerson's declaration and, therefore, cannot provide a comment."
Still, what Wilkerson described may have
very well been an issue in Hamad's case, although as Jim White
pointed out in
a blog post, the Pentagon appears to have had a policy in place
to,
"justify the long-term detention and interrogation of innocent
civilians."
According to Hamad's lawsuit, the
Pentagon had cleared him for release in November 2005, according to
a redacted copy of his clearance decision his attorneys cited in
their complaint.
But he was not freed from Guantanamo
until December 2007. His attorneys said they were notified via email
in March 2007 that Hamad was eligible to be sent back home to Sudan
and it was during negotiations with the Sudanese government that
they discovered he was eligible for release a full two years
earlier.
About 183 detainees, many of whom have
already been cleared for release, remain at Guantanamo.
A majority
of them have never been charged with a crime.
