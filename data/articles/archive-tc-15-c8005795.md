Question from JD in New York: She sent this question in before
Awareness discussed this particular book. She writes:
"I have just
finished reading
Trance Formation of America, the true-life story of
a CIA mind-control slave, by Cathy O'Brien, with Mark Phillips. It
is the most disturbing book I have ever read, due in part to the
chillingly unemotional manner in which the victims detail the most
hideous and revolting physical, mental, emotional abuse and tortures
to which she was repeatedly subjected.
In the past, Awareness has indicated that certain things were or are
done by
the New World Order cabal which sounded so outrageous and
improbable that I had great difficulty regarding them as likely
fact. In addition, I had accumulated other snatches of purported
information from seemingly reliable sources, including my own
deductive and noetic faculties.
The cumulative total of these had not even vaguely prepared me for
the shocking horrifying picture given in revolting detail in this
account of the heartless, ruthless, arrogant, power-drunk
machinations. It names names -- intimate details specified -- of the
New World Order planners.
This extensive first-hand account of trauma-induced mind control
wove the previous fragments into a coherent and totally credible
picture of vulnerable persons, mostly female, often juvenile, --
abused skillfully, mentally fragmented, trained and controlled for
use in political and lucrative operations including prostitution,
pornography, blackmails, secret communications, drug and money
running, and as programmed sex toys at the beck and call of
handlers, pedophiles, sadists and even murderers.
The programming designation is given as "MK-Ultra Project Monarch."
First, can Awareness confirm the contents of this book as
essentially factual?"
A:
This is in the affirmative. This awareness indicates the entity
presented the information as clearly, as concise and as accurately
as she could. The problem was there was so much more that she could
have inserted that was not inserted because of the lack of room.
There was much that could have been emphasized further which was
often understated.
THE SEARCH FOR CHILD PORNOGRAPHERS
Question: "Is the primary purpose of the heralded search for child
pornographers primarily in fact a search for sexual abused children
who can be acquired for this mind control slavery program, using as
leverage the threat of prosecution of the porn vendor who is usually
the child's parent?"
A:
This awareness indicates that this is correct in regard to the
Monarch project -- that not all efforts to prevent child pornography
are linked to the Monarch project.
HOW MANY HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED?
Question: "When did this project gear up? And how many people to
date have been thus victimized?"
A:
This awareness indicates this began in the late fifties and early
sixties. It became conceived during that time and became active in
the mid-sixties. There rest of the question be repeated please.
Question: "How many people to date have been thus victimized?"
A:
This awareness sees this as having been several thousand, but most
were not prominently known. Most are anonymous persons. Many of the
missing children on milk cartons are victims of such programming.
This awareness indicates there is a joke among these entities,
wherein they refer to these abductees as the 'milk carton kids'.
Question: "What percentage of these are female?"
A:
This awareness indicates this approximately two thirds.
Question: "What percentage of these began their victimization at government
hands while still children?"
A:
This awareness suggests this as approximately 80% or more. It is
relatively rare that the government agencies use adult entities for
such purposes, unless they have already some history in being the
victims of pornography. This awareness indicates that in many cases
the intelligence agencies use these entities for spying or for
international intrigue operations in which the entity would be
subjected to using sex to lure some foreign official into action
that would be promoted for the purpose of espionage or some other
activity.
Question: "What percentage came from child care institutions?"
A:
This awareness suggests this being approximately twenty percent;
that the child care institutions involved in such activity would be
those specifically set up for this kind of action or which had been
perverted from their original intent, such as Boy's Town in
Nebraska.
This awareness indicates that most child care institutions have been
given a bad rap, being blamed for things which give the government
the appearance of trying to protect children, when in most cases,
the institution was not guilty of any such crime.
Question: "What percentage were simply abducted from their families, if any."
A:
This awareness indicates this being approximately 50%. There are
certain networks wherein abductees are moved and brought into
centers for further processing into these government agencies for
the further indoctrination into the pornographic industry.
Question: "Were these victims exclusively Americans?"
A:
This is negative.
Question: "How many have been killed, as Cathy O'Brien was slated to have
been?"
A:
Over the past 40 years, this is seen as approximately 4,000, though
not all of these 4,000 were in the Monarch program itself, some
being on the fringe, or used without being fully involved in the
program.
HOW MANY U.S. CITIZENS KNOWINGLY PARTICIPATE?
Question: "Approximately how many U.S. citizens are knowingly
involved in the training, handling and use of these slaves?"
A:
The term 'knowingly' is a limiting term. This awareness suggests
this as being less than 2,000 entities.
IS "PROJECT MONARCH" STILL OPERATING?
Question: "Ms. O'Brien was rescued by Mark Phillips in 1988. Has the
"program" continued unabated since those days?"
A:
This as in the affirmative. She has been struggling to free her
daughter from the program. As of now she has not been successful in
totally freeing her daughter in spite of efforts in courts and in
spite of the work and effect of her book.
WHAT CAN BE DONE TO STOP THIS PROJECT?
Question: "Although the account would not be believable by most, nor
would most care to wade through such repulsive details, the book has
been published in two editions thus far, and undoubtedly discussed
on the Internet. What else can be done to put an end to this
shameful and horrible situation which is being kept secret?
Investigations are stonewalled under the National Security Act."
A:
This awareness indicates entities could purchase copies of the book,
send them to their Congressional and Senatorial leaders with the
demand that this be investigated by Congress and that the entities
involved be investigated. This Awareness suggests also copies to be
sent to, or summaries of the book to be sent to news media outlets,
to churches and to various officials, locally and nationally and in
this manner, entities can begin to stir up more and more concern.
This awareness suggests also that those groups that are looking out
for children should be given copies with questions:
"What are you
doing about this kind of thing? If you can't do something about it,
why do you exist as a group, taking donations for the sake of
missing children?"
Put people on the spot. Get people to buy two
books every time they want to order one, and have them send a copy
to someone in a prominent position who might do something.
Put information on the Internet about this. Put information in your
newspapers editorials about this. Get information out as far and
wide as possible. This awareness indicates that once the New World
Order is set up, it will be impossible to bring up such a topic.
Likewise, more and more of the children will officially be taken
from families with the statement that they have been abused or
neglected, and these children will be put into situations of what is
termed 'white slavery' -- being sent to foreign countries for
further pornographic use.
This awareness indicates that this is part of the agenda in the
final outcome of the New World Order's plans -- to use people as
commodities and to use them as slaves. Indoctrinating and training
the young people into being used will be brought into play in the
early days of the New World Order, but not likely before "the mark"
has been installed in the use of the chip implantations, and not
likely will there be any opportunity for such activity prior to the
removal of guns from the American people.
This awareness indicates at present, the proliferation of hand guns
among the American people is the greatest deterrent to hinder and
hold back the New World Order from implementing its complete control
over the lives of the masses of people. There is very little respect
for the masses. They are seen as likened unto possessions from the
viewpoint of these world elite planners and corporate executives,
and therefore, they do not have a compassion or respect for the
people. They are seen simply as excessive resource.
There is too much of humanity, in their mind, and they have little
concern for individuality, or the feelings of entities. They are
seen as 'consumers' or in many cases 'useless consumers',
particularly if they cannot earn their own consumption value. If
they consume more than they produce for the government or the
corporations, they are seen as strictly useless meat on the hoof.
This awareness indicates that attitude is that which is of no
respect to individuality, and therefore, these entities see that
they can do anything they want if they can simply get by with it,
and the New World Order is being used to set up the situations so
that they can get by with anything they want in order to utilize
human resources, just as they would utilize mineral resources or
vegetation resources and timber resources, et cetera.
The value system in the last 30 years has been altered so greatly
that there is little value left in regard to human values or
spiritual values. The making of money is the bottom line value in
the modern society, and everyone is more interested in "How can
money be made?"
Taking organs from this person to give to that person is not for
life saving, it is for the money that comes from such cannibalism of
the various organs, and likewise, with all of the other aspects of
the human resources, the bottom line is "Can money be made off of
this activity? What other activities can be encouraged that will
make money?"
Thus, prostitution and pornography will become an even greater and
more open industry after the New World Order is fully implemented.
At present it is an industry that is hidden behind the scenes.
This awareness indicates that generally, when something of this
nature is implemented into society, there is a way of impressing
society that it is necessary for the security of the nation or of
the people, and when this is used as an argument, in most cases, the
people will accept it.
This awareness indicates however, as has been said, entities who put
too much value on security open themselves to become victims of
maximum security, thus, slavery and bondage becomes the outcome of
excessive security and entities give up freedoms and the right to
express themselves, or the desire to have decency at representing
their governments and leaders.
At this time, the value of decency has eroded so greatly that most
politicians can be indecent and still win the election if they can
show how they are helping the masses improve their lifestyle and
their security in their lives.
There are many entities who have been
conditioned to think that money gives them freedom, that money and
security are the bottom line for a happy life. They have not fully
thought through how much value there is in being free or in being
able to go from one place to another without having to get
permission from some authority.
As entities become more dependant on government it puts them back
into the situation they experienced as children when their parents
were overbearing, over-controlling, and when as children, they could
only dream of growing up and becoming independent adults. But many
adults do not know what to do with their freedom and thus enjoy
subjecting themselves to an overbearing government and are willing
to lose their freedoms in order to have greater protection and
greater benefits from the governments that they choose to serve
them.
When this becomes the greater value, they can be persuaded to remain
placid and quiet and silent and go along, to get along, even when
the government begins to raid their neighbor's home, take the
neighbor's children, et cetera, and they will not ask:
"What
happened? Where did they go?" or if they do, and the government
simply says: "We are taking care of the entity's family. The entity
committed crimes and we have moved the family to a safe place", the
masses will say "Oh! That's good!", without further investigation.
This awareness indicates if they did attempt to investigate, they
would run into those who stopped them from going further in their
investigation. They would run into stories and statements to assure
them that,
"All is well, the entity will get a fair trial, the family
is relocated to a nice place, in a nice home, and therefore, you
need not worry about their safety and their welfare any further."
Meanwhile, the family may be up on the blocks being sold into white
slavery or shipped to another country for further use as human
resources in slavery or in prostitution or some other money-making
activity.
This awareness indicates that this book by Cathy O'Brien is a
powerful, ugly, disturbing book that discloses first-hand the inner
workings of the New World Order and those entities who are so well
known, whose names are household names, so that entities upon
reading this book will be disturbed, will be upset, angered,
frustrated, but they will as least not be led like sheep or cattle
to the slaughter without knowing who is behind this project.
This awareness indicates if there are enough people who awaken to
this diabolical activity that is now progressing, it may not be
possible for these entities to continue their program. They are
really a relatively small group when compared to the millions of
people in the world. It is just that they have control over the
media, and because they have control over the media and over money,
they are able to keep others quiet and to intimidate the masses.
This awareness indicates once the masses awaken like a giant mob or
a giant army of citizens, these entities would have absolutely no
chance of ruling a new world government to subject the masses to
slavery.
HOW CAN CATHY GET HER DAUGHTER BACK?
Question: "Cathy's daughter Kelly is being held as a mental patient
by the state of Tennessee, "for reasons of national security", to
prevent Mark and Cathy from deprogramming and rehabilitating her, as
Mark has done with Cathy. Please tell us what Cathy can do to get
her daughter back?"
A:
This awareness indicates that one of the things that readers of the
book can do is to send messages and demands, flooding the state of
Tennessee, in terms of its governor, in terms of its governing
officials and in terms of the institute that holds this entity,
demanding that they free her, demanding that newspapers and media
take the story, go to this entity, and interview the entity, attempt
to tell the story on some of the tabloid shows on television.
It is unlikely that this will actually occur, but the pressure may
grow sufficiently to cause these entities to eventually want to
quietly usher her out into her mother's care. This awareness
indicates at least they will know that the public is aware of what
is happening to this child and they will be aware that if they
simply elect to kill the child, then they will also be thrown into
the spotlight, because so many entities are aware of the situation
of the child being thus held.
WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP THE NEW WORLD ORDER?
(KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. SPREAD THE KNOWLEDGE!)
Question: "Whereas the New World Order planners have cornered drug
markets, petroleum supplies, weapons and economies, "black wealth"
-- what can be done to stop them?"
A:
This awareness indicates this is the big $64.00 question. There is
no sentence, there is no paragraph, there is no reading that this
awareness can give that will serve as an answer to that question.
This awareness indicates what is stopping them right now is the fact
that the masses still have some 75 million guns and that the masses
do not fully trust the government, do not trust the government to
represent the people, and the patriot groups are growing stronger.
These are the main things that are stopping the New World Order
planners. They are desperately trying to find ways to defuse the
information coming out against them. They are also trying to find
ways to disarm the militias and the citizens of this country. This
awareness indicates that it is still a struggle, and it cannot
simply be answered by a question to this awareness. It is something
that is happening.
This awareness indicates this is likened unto asking during the
middle of World War II: "What can be done to end this war?" The
question seems to be meaningful, but there is not some answer for
such a question. The answer that, "Well, they're working on an
atomic bomb" would not actually answer the question as it was
intended, for the ending of World War II, because it is not a
question of what will end this war, or what will be done in the
conclusion of this war; it is a Question: "What can be done to end
this war?" with the implication being: "What can we as entities do?"
This awareness indicates that each entity, by being aware, adds to
the power of the masses. Entities who are not aware are simply
uninvolved bodies, human meat on the hoof, as they would say, and
they contribute nothing to, or nothing of value to the ending of the
crisis, or to the resolution of the crisis. They are simply there,
like a tree, like a bush. The bushes and the trees in battle do not
play much of a part. They may be used for entities to hide behind,
or they may be slaughtered during the war, but the bush and the tree
have no motivation to do anything in regard to a battle.
Likewise,
entities who do not know what is going on, who are not
aware, are much the same. They may be used, and they may be
slaughtered or victimized, but they do not know why, and they do not
know what they are doing, if they do anything. If they hide the
enemy, if they help the enemy, if they fight the enemy, then
perhaps, out of personal frustration, they may end up doing
something to support the masses, but they may also just as easily
support the enemy because they do not know what is going on.
This awareness indicates what entities can do is spread the
information. This book itself (Trance Formation of America) is a
very powerful weapon against the New World Order, and the more
entities have this in their hands, it is actually more powerful than
the gun, and if entities have this information then they can do more
for the prevention of the New World Order than if they have never
heard or witnessed or understood these things.
This awareness indicates it is not the first time that writing --
the pen -- is used to win a victory. Thomas Paine and his writings
helped to win the Revolutionary War, helped to turn the tide against
the supporters of Britain, and in favor of the colonies and their
independence. This awareness indicates that this book (Trance Formation of America) can do much the same.
This awareness reminds you of two other books: "Treason: The New
World Order" by Gurudas, and the book by
David Icke: "And The Truth
Shall Set You Free" - these two books also have powerful
information. Knowledge is power, and knowledge can help entities to
better improve their lives, and with these books, entities can be
much more powerful as individuals and can help others to have more
power also, and the empowerment of the masses is essential in
throwing off the yoke of tyranny.
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OFFICIALS ARE PART OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER?
Question: "What percentage, approximately, of the United States
government upper level officials, Congress persons et cetera, are
part of the New World Order cabal?"
A:
This awareness indicates that there are many entities in the upper
echelon that have some connections. Those who are part of the
Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), and those who are in
the Bilderbergs, and those media personnel who are also involved in
those organizations, and
the Trilateralists - these entities are
more or less in what the entity refers to as the 'cabal'.
The entities work to some extent with a certain amount of
understanding for the New World Order. To some degree they are not
completely informed, partly because their focus is not so much on
bringing off the New World Order -- they are most interested in
being elected and in enhancing their own power and prestige. They
see the cooperation with the New World Order agenda as benefiting
their position, their personal position, and therefore, they go
along, to get along.
Many of these entities, if the tide turned suddenly, would also turn
their allegiance to the winning side, to become more of a patriot,
if they saw that would enhance their personal prestige and better
their status. This awareness suggests that approximately half of the
government in legislature and in the executive branch and the Senate
would be considered as part of the cabal.
The entities in the Justice Department appear to be even
more so,
more than half as working in this direction. For one thing, those in
the Justice Department are more controlled by their Freemasonry
backgrounds and these entities being more influenced by Freemasonry
- because Freemasonry is a major player in
the New World Order -
will have an influence through the use of the courts and the law,
and the judicial department will have an effect on many individuals
and situations, so that these entities, while perhaps being
approximately 60 to 65% involved in the New World Order, can in some
ways have an even greater than 60% to 65% effect on the outcome.
This awareness indicates, however, none has as much potential as the
millions of entities who make up the masses, the citizens of the
country. If this citizenry ever fully awakens, it will be impossible
for the New World Order to gain any degree of power. It will
crumble, and many of these entities will scramble to hide and deny
their involvement.
This awareness indicates that this book (Trance Formation of
America), and these other two, and any other similar books, do
indeed constitute some extremely powerful weapons in the struggle
against tyranny. How long these books will be available is of course
an issue of great concern.
They should be purchased and spread far
and wide as quickly as possible. If entities could spare $300.00 to
purchase copies of these books to send to others, to awaken them, it
would be a great move on the part of entities, in the preservation
of decency and of the values that have made this country an ideal,
likened unto a modern-day Camelot, in which legends are made.
OTHER MIND-CONTROLLED SLAVES ARE
SUDDENLY WAKING UP: WHY?
Question: "I have corresponded with the author, and read additional
evidence she sent me. It appears that numerous mind control victims
have recently begun having conscious recall of memories, supposedly
effectively suppressed. What caused this? Is it due to the nearing
Photon Belt energies? Or the waxing energies in our world of the
spirit of truth? Or perhaps waxing Aquarian Age energies, or some
other astrological influence?"
A:
This awareness indicates these are influences -- they are not the
only cause however, they are contributing causes. Another cause is
that the mind itself, the very nature of the human spirit is such
that it tends to examine its own programming from time to time, and
entities who developed as children will eventually, at some time in
their life, begin to examine their childhood, those feelings, those
thoughts, those experiences that have disturbed them, and they may
begin to unravel certain insight that help them better understand
what occurred, and memories will flash back to them, things they had
suppressed and forgotten for many years.
It is the human spirit that does not accept slavery, even of the
mind, does not accept being enslaved, nor does it accept the
enslavement of consciousness, and the human spirit eventually begins
to seek freedom and find a way out of its programming and
conditioning into slavery, and thus, there were, in the sixties and
seventies, statements suggested by
Dr. Beter, in his contacts with
CIA agents, that many of these entities were programmed to forget
what they knew, but were beginning to remember, and had begun to
inform him of information that was not intended for the public.
Likewise, the same thing occurs today, with many of these Monarch
programmed people. It was assumed that
the mind control could be
used to totally create new areas in a person's mind so that they
could be totally controlled. But this awareness indicates there are
many, many cases of the controlled mind breaking free and recalling
things that had been suppressed, either by drugs and hypnosis, or by
trauma.
This is the result of the human spirit and its need to be free.
DURING THE 60'S, PSYCHEDELICS AWAKENED THE MASSES
A:
This awareness indicates in the 1960's, when
the MKULTRA programming
was first brought into experimental stage and the use of LSD and hallucinogenics and psychedelics was introduced into groups, the
intent of the CIA was to find out what effect it would have in
helping to control the masses, but they suddenly found that it was
causing the masses to awaken and to throw off programmings that had
been put in place over many decades, so that suddenly they had
people in the streets objecting to the war in Vietnam because they
had taken some LSD, or some peyote, or some other psychedelic, and
had seen that the war was just a designed program to help the
corporations gain greater powers, to help the munitions people to
get greater wealth, and they began to protest the war and seek to
save the lives of entities in that war, and stop the government from
sending young boys into battle for a war that served only the
corporations.
These entities, having used these particular types of drugs that
awakened their consciousness, instead of being guinea pigs to find a
way to control the masses, became free of mind control that had been
put upon them since childhood. Many threw off the mind control from
their childhood religions.
Many threw off the mind control from
their parents. Many threw off the mind control from government
propaganda and tradition, and sought new ways of doing things, and
sought ways to find greater freedom, and to spread that freedom to
others.
This awareness indicates that the weird dress was simply a rebellion
against the mind control of fashion, and of traditional dress. And
these entities wanted to show themselves to be free of that kind of
social control, and this awareness indicates that essentially, those
psychedelics helped entities to free their spirit, to become more
free than they had ever imagined possible, and this awareness
indicates that this is again the dream of the current day user of
drugs.
They want to find freedom. But today, the drugs have been
more selectively introduced into the country -- drugs that tend to
enslave entities, rather than free them.
Even the current drugs of a psychedelic nature are not as pure, or
are not as freeing as the ones used in the sixties. There are many
entities who think that cocaine, which gives them a feeling of
power, is actually a drug that is freeing them of their weakness. It
does not free them of their weakness, it simply creates another form
of dependency.
They depend on the use of the drug to feel good, to feel important,
to feel that they have some kind of personal power, and thus, they
become more enslaved by the drugs that are being brought into this
country by certain shadow government agencies, such as that which
was run by
George H.W. Bush and Clinton, and others through Mena,
Arkansas, in the last decade.
This awareness indicates that these same forces are still bringing
in drugs to the country to seduce and lure the youth into thinking
they find freedom through the use of these drugs, when in actuality,
the drugs being issued into this country today are simply adding to
the controls on the minds of people.
THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL
A:
This awareness indicates that entities should not despair, for there
is an enormous numbers of people whose interests lie in preserving
the good life for each other, and those who would enslave the masses
are very few, and though they have many who work for them, do so
more out of fear than out of desire. They do not desire to enslave
their fellow associates, but will do so because they are afraid that
if they do not, they themselves will suffer greater ills.
This awareness indicates that gradually, as the masses awaken, they
begin to recognize who their true enemies and oppressors are, and as
these masses awaken, those who reside in positions in between will
come to recognize the power of the masses as being greater than that
of the masters, and their allegiance will change, not to support the
masters, but to work for the masses.
This awareness indicates that therefore, it does appear, although it
is perhaps too early to say, it does appear that the masses in the
end will remain in charge and regain the power that has been
designed to them by the Constitution, and those who would destroy
the Constitution and enslave the masses will be out of luck, and
will have exposed themselves for what they are.
A WAR OF INFORMATION IS OCCURRING
A:
This awareness indicates that it does appear that this should not be
construed as telling entities that they can forget it and relax,
that all is well, for all is not well yet. You are involved in a war
of information -- it is not as of yet a shooting war. It may never
become a shooting war, for the information that is spread to awaken
the masses may be sufficient to ward off any shooting war, and to
keep the masses free from oppression.
This awareness indicates changes occur, decade after decade. They
occur so slow and so subtly, that sometimes entities are not even
aware of the changes until they look back over months, years or
decades and see how much has occurred in the way of change.
This
awareness indicates that entities should not be discouraged, should
not be depressed by the continual threats of conquest by those who
would subjugate the masses, for this has always gone on in humanity,
but there are always those thrilling moments and pages in history
where entities have thrown off the yoke of oppression and found
moments, glory and freedom and expression, and these have grown more
and more frequent as the centuries have passed.
YOU ARE THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF THE FUTURE GENERATIONS
A:
This awareness indicates that the threat is one thing, and needs to
be observed and needs to be given attention, but a threat, while it
may continue to exist, does not necessarily result in oppression.
The resulting oppression is that which comes when entities do not
heed or watch and become aware of the threats.
Therefore, this
awareness suggests that you continue to be awakened and alarmed, but
you appreciate the moments wherein you are free, and use those
moments to help preserve future freedom, to help defuse that threat
that might otherwise impinge on your future.
This awareness indicates that you think not only of your own
freedom, but also of the freedom of your children and the future
generations, for you are the founding fathers of the future
generations. You are the heroes of tomorrow's generations, and if
you fail these future generations, these children of your children
may curse you and rightly so.
