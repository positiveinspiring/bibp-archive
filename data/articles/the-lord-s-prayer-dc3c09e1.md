The Lord's Prayer
Prayer
Vs Meditation--which is more spiritual?
This Awareness indicates that "meditation"
relates to the word "medium", and "medium" is like that
which is a yoke or connection force. The word 'Yoga' or 'yoke', hooking together
two aspects. This Awareness indicates the medium, in terms of the seance and
the spiritual world; the medium between two forces or between two entities,--this
as always seen as a connecting energy or force. This Awareness indicates that
the meditation is an action which links one with that which is focussed upon.
This Awareness indicates that wherein
you meditate on water, you will find yourself experiencing qualities of water.
This Awareness indicates wherein you meditate on rocks, you will find yourself
experiencing the qualities of a rock, or of rocks. This Awareness suggests
when meditating upon trees, you will feel yourself experiencing the qualities
of trees. This Awareness suggests when meditating upon the Father in heaven,
you will find yourself feeling the qualities of the Father in Heaven. This
Awareness indicates that when you meditate on the Kingdom Within, you will
feel yourself experiencing feelings of the Kingdom Within.
The meaning of: "I and the Father are one"
This Awareness indicates that the entity
Christ stated, "I and the Father are one." This Awareness indicates
this as the Christ Light and the speaker, unified in one as a kind of oneness
that was brought on by the medium or meditation of uniting or at-one-ment
or the atonement of the surrender of the self to the Divine Within.
This Awareness indicates that in
the action of prayer, wherein one asks for something of a superior being,
or one who can provide that,--whether this as a prayer in
a court of law, asking the judge to grant the favor, whether this as a prayer
by a child to the mother, a pleading to receive some request as granted, whether
this is a petition to society, or whether this is a petition to God, asking
for some blessing, some reward, some favor, asking for forgiveness, or something
of benefit,--this Awareness indicates that whatever the action, in terms of
prayer, there always must be that feeling of separation, whereby the entity
requesting is beneath and lower than that which may provide. This Awareness
indicates that there is nothing wrong with praying and asking for help.
This Awareness indicates that entities
who are in need, should in fact ask for assistance, should in fact ask for
help, particularly when they cannot help themselves. This Awareness indicates
however, praying or pleading is not the most efficient and rewarding state
of consciousness, is not the highest state of action, is not the most spiritual
thing an entity can do. Praying, pleading, petitioning, begging of Divine
Forces, of higher forces, of friends or associates: this kind of dependency,
while sometimes necessary, is not the most spiritual action that an entity
can engage in. The most spiritual action occurs when the entity
surrenders to the Will of the Divine, trusts the Divine to supply whatever
is the Will of the Divine, and accepts whatever the Will of the Divine may
provide.
The most spiritual action is surrendering to the Will of the Divine
This Awareness indicates the entity Christ in his prayer, asked that the cup be taken from him, but acknowledged a willingness to accept the cup if it turned out to be the Will of the Divine: "Thy Will be done". This Awareness indicates therefore, the entity gave a prayer, then surrendered his own will to the Will of the Divine, allowing It to determine, and accepting whatever judgment would be rendered in that determination.
"Thy Will
be done"
This Awareness indicates that this
action as a form of meditation, whereby the entity surrenders to the Will
of the Divine, becomes One with that Will of the Divine. This Awareness indicates
that in this manner the entity gave forth the Lord's Prayer which was in fact,
an action that linked the concept of prayer to the concept of surrender to
the Divine. This Awareness indicates that action of surrendering to the Divine
is in fact the meditation, is in fact the purpose and goal and result of true
meditation.
This Awareness indicates that the
action of opening oneself up to receive is an action of prayer. The action
of receiving the Will of the Divine is the action of meditation. This Awareness
indicates essentially, the process which entities use in terms of meditation
includes both the willingness to be open to receive, which is a quest or prayer
for unity with the Divine; and that unity is the meditation, the medium by
which the entities merge,--the physical being and the spiritual Divine Force
merging together through the medium of atonement or meditation.

81-21)
A count of 144
This Awareness indicates also
that It wishes you to not only meditate, 15 minutes daily, at times you set
for yourself, but to begin each meditation with a count of 144. This being
a mystical number associated with Light frequencies.
This Awareness indicates the aliens
are well aware of the power of Light. They use it in their technology, but
they are not used to using it in drawing in spiritual Light. By counting 144
with the intention of drawing in spiritual Light to this planet, it will have
a profound and powerful effect in reducing the strength of negative technology
used by the aliens, and it will strengthen the spirituality of humans so that
they can find for themselves the inner guidance, and inner strength and spiritual
unity to deal with the difficulties that are coming. This Awareness indicates
it will also diminish much of the violence that is occurring on Earth in your
cities, streets and in the areas of conflict around the world conflict around
the world.
"This Awareness wishes entities
to look toward each other and cease finding the flaw in each other's eyes
and look for the Divine Light that rests behind those eyes, that you may communicates
with one another as gods. This Awareness wishes entities to cease being gods
of power and begin being gods of mercy and love."
