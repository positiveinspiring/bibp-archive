One of the more bizarre aspects of the last nine
months of Snowden revelations is how top political officials in other
nations have repeatedly demonstrated, or even explicitly claimed, wholesale
ignorance about their nations' cooperation with the National Security
Agency, as well as their own spying activities.
This has led to widespread speculation about the
authenticity of these reactions:
Were these top officials truly unaware, or
were they pretending to be, in order to distance themselves from
surveillance operations that became highly controversial once disclosed?
In Germany, when Der Spiegel
first reported last June that the NSA was engaged in mass spying aimed
at the German population, Chancellor Angela Merkel and other senior
officials publicly expressed outrage - only for that paper to then reveal
documents
showing extensive cooperation between
the NSA and the German spy agency BND.
In the Netherlands, a cabinet minister was
forced to survive a
no-confidence vote after he admitted to having
wrongfully attributed the collection of metadata from 1.8 million calls to
the NSA rather than the Dutch spying agency.
In the UK, Chris Huhne, a former cabinet
minister and member of the national security council until 2012,
insisted that ministers were in "utter ignorance" about even the largest
GCHQ spying program, known as
Tempora,
"or its US counterpart, the
NSA's Prism," as
well as "about their extraordinary capability to hoover up and store
personal emails, voice contact, social networking activity and even
internet searches."
A similar controversy arose in the U.S., when
the White House
claimed that President Obama
was kept 'unaware' of the NSA's surveillance
of Merkel's personal cell phone and those of other allied leaders.
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne
Feinstein
claimed the same ignorance, while an
unnamed NSA source told a German newspaper that
the White House knew.
A new NSA document published today by The
Intercept sheds considerable light on these questions. The classified
document contains an internal NSA interview with an official from the SIGINT
Operations Group in NSA's Foreign Affairs Directorate.
Titled "What
Are We After with Our Third Party Relationships? - And What Do They Want
from Us, Generally Speaking?", the
discussion explores the NSA's cooperative relationship with its surveillance
partners.
Upon being asked whether political shifts within
those nations affect the NSA's relationships, the SIGINT official explains
why such changes generally have no effect:
because only a handful of military officials
in those countries are aware of the spying activities. Few, if any,
elected leaders have any knowledge of the surveillance.
Are our foreign intelligence
relationships usually insulated from short-term political ups and
downs, or not?
(S//SI//REL) For a variety of reasons, our
intelligence relationships are rarely disrupted by foreign political
perturbations, international or domestic.
First, we are helping our
partners address critical intelligence shortfalls, just as they are
assisting us. Second, in many of our
foreign partners' capitals, few senior officials outside of their
defense-intelligence apparatuses are witting to any SIGINT connection to
the U.S./NSA.
The official adds that there,
"are exceptions, both on the positive and
negative sides."
He gives two examples:
"For instance, since the election of a
pro-American president, one European partner has been much more open to
providing information on their own capabilities and techniques, in hope
of raising our intelligence collaboration to a higher level.
Conversely, another of our partnerships has
stalled, due largely to that country's regional objectives not being in
synch with those of the U.S."
In general, however, many of these
"relationships have, indeed, spanned several decades" and are unaffected by
changes due to elections, in large part because the mere existence of these
activities is kept from the political class.
The implications for democratic accountability
are clear.
In
an October Guardian op-ed, Huhne, the British former cabinet
minister, noted that,
"when it comes to the secret world of GCHQ and
the [NSA], the depth of my privileged information' has been dwarfed by
the information provided by Edward Snowden to the Guardian."
Detailing what appears to be the systematic
attempt to keep political officials in the dark, he wrote:
"The Snowden revelations put a giant
question mark into the middle of our surveillance state. It is time our
elected representatives insisted on some answers before destroying the
values we should protect."
The dangers posed by a rogue national security
state, operating in secret and without the knowledge of democratically
elected officials, have long been understood.
After serving two terms as president, Dwight
D. Eisenhower famously worried in
his 1961 Farewell Address about the
accumulated power of the,
"conjunction of an immense military
establishment and a large arms industry," warning of what he called the
"grave implications" of "the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex."
He urged citizens:
"The potential for the disastrous rise of
misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of
this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes."
A secret GCHQ memo,
reported by the Guardian in October, demonstrates that the
agency's primary motive for concealing its surveillance activities is that
disclosure could trigger what it called "damaging public debate," as well as
legal challenges throughout Europe.
Those fears became realized when, in the wake of
Snowden revelations, privacy
lawsuits against the agency were filed in Europe, GCHQ officials were
forced to
publicly
testify for the first time before Parliament, and an EU Parliamentary
inquiry earlier this year concluded NSA/GCHQ
activities were likely illegal.
The British agency was also concerned about,
"damage to partner relationships if
sensitive information were accidentally released in open court,"
...given that such disclosures could make
citizens in other countries aware, for the first time, of their government's
involvement in mass surveillance.
The revelations of a global system of blanket
surveillance have come as a great surprise to hundreds of millions of
citizens around the world whose governments were operating these systems
without their knowledge.
But they also came as a surprise to many
high-ranking political officials in countries around the world who were
previously ignorant of those programs, a fact which the NSA seems to view as
quite valuable in ensuring that its surveillance activities remain immune
from election outcomes and democratic debate.
