Is To Own A Bank.
The big investment banks that have promoted the deregulation of the economy,
and ultimately created the conditions for the Great Recession, are now
bigger and richer than ever.
In 1995, the six largest US banks,
-
Goldman Sachs
-
Bank of America
-
JP Morgan Chase
-
Citigroup
-
Wells Fargo
-
Morgan Stanley,
...declared assets equivalent to less than 20%
of the United States (U.S.) gross domestic product GDP.
By 2009, this figure increased to about 60% of
the U.S. GDP. [1]
After the crisis, the US government has not only failed to reduce their
size, and regulate their activities, but has also provided them with large
sums of taxpayers money (bailouts) making them even more powerful.
These firms are now advocating for austerity
and budget cuts on Medicaid, Medicare and Social security to prevent
the so-called fiscal cliff they have created.
They literally feel invulnerable. They know that, if they cause another
crisis, the U.S. government will bail them out (once again):
they are too big to fail.
They also know that, if their CEOs will engage
in even more financial fraud and insider trading, none of them will be
convicted:
they are too big to jail.
Has your blood started boiling already?
If so, you should see a cardiologist. If not, a
psychologist would work.
