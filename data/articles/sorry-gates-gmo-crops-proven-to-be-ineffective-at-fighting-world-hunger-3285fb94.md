Monsanto shareholder
Bill Gates has argued that
GMOs are the solution to world hunger, going as far as to say that they are
actually needed to fight worldwide starvation.
Unfortunately for Gates, who
back in 2010
bought 500,000 shares of the company he is now promoting in
mainstream media as the solution to the worlds problems, a team of 900
scientists have found that
GMO crops are actually not effective at fighting
world hunger.
In fact, the massive team found that Monsantos seeds, which
have lead to thousands of farmer suicides due to excessive costs and failure
to yield crops, were outperformed by traditional agro-ecological farming
practices.
Funded by the
World Bank and
United Nations, an organization was created
known as the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and
Technology for Development (IAASTD).
Consisting of 900 scientists and
researchers, they set out to examine the complex issue of world hunger.
While the issue of world hunger may be quite complex, their results were
not.
Quite plainly, the group found that genetically modified crops
were not
a meaningful solution to the problem. In other words, the expert team showed
through rigorous analysis and repeated study that the claims made by Bill
Gates are completely inaccurate.
Perhaps what is most compelling, though, is the fact that Bill Gates was
fully aware of these findings before going on air to inform the public that
GMOs are the solution to world hunger.
The same GMOs that have been linked
to
organ damage,
mutated insects, and a host of other issues.
Bill Gates Knew of These Findings Beforehand
The findings of the IAASTD regarding the ineffectiveness of GMO crops were
published on April 15, 2008. That is long before Bill Gates address to the
public in late January of this year.
Did Monsanto stockholder Gates ignore
this information, or does he believe the 900 scientists to be incorrect? Perhaps the evidence generated from the expert team is not enough.
In that
case, then Gates should look no farther than the Union of Concerned
Scientists.
Another massive research organization, the
Union of Concerned Scientists
also examined the true yield of GMO crops, only to find that the altered
crops do not produce increased yields over the long run - despite their
excessive cost and extreme danger to health and environment.
The lack of
scientific support behind the GMO crops was so startling to the Union that
they documented all the details in a
2009 report entitled Failure to
Yield.
GMO crops are not only ineffective at fighting world hunger, but are a
genuine threat to public health. Even if they were effective at feeding more
individuals than traditional farming practices, would they really want to
consume it?
Bill Gates appears to have the interests of massive corporations
in mind when perpetuating the myth that GMOs are the answer to fighting
starvation.
