Yesterday, I carried a story on a crash between
a French Air Force Mirage and a Royal Saudi Air Force F-15.
The story confirmed that the Saudi pilot and the
two French pilots were safe. Little additional information was available.
Today, I am able to report that the two-seat Mirage was in fact either a
French Air Force
Mirage 2000-D or a 2000-N.

Both aircraft, in their later variants are
virtually identical and are used for the long-range nuclear strike role by
the French Air Force.
This begs the question,
Is NATO preparing to 'go nuclear' in the
coming General Middle East War against Iran and Syria?
There are hundreds of allied fighter-bombers
available in the Middle East that can hit targets in Iran and Syria. Why
bring in the specialized long-range nuclear capable Mirages?
Currently, within the last week or so, the following battle forces have been
assembled by NATO in the Middle East.
A massive war armada is sitting just south of
the Strait of Hormuz, it consists of three US Navy super-carrier battle
groups:
-
the USS Carl Vinson
-
the USS John C. Stennis
-
the USS Abraham Lincoln
Each battle group generally has four or five
Aegis air defense cruisers and destroyers, and usually one to three other
destroyers and/or frigates, plus a large support ship and one or two
hunter-killer nuclear submarines.
Additionally, there are up to three other large flat-tops, US Navy assault
carriers and their battle groups.
These include the
USS Makin Island with its USMC Harriers and
various Marine attack and assault helicopters. The Makin Island has the
capability to off load Marine amphibious assault crafts and its battle group
is accompanied by the USS New Orleans and the USS Pearl Harbor, both very
powerful assault ships capable of launching large numbers of Marine
amphibious crafts.
Additionally, the French Navy has brought in its top-of-the-line nuclear
carrier, the Charles DeGaulle, with its battle group.
The British Royal Navy has added to its local
fleet its most powerful warship the Type 45 Air Defense Destroyer the HMS
Daring. The combination of the French carrier and the US super-carriers
means that fully one-third of all the nuclear powered aircraft carriers on
Earth are now assembled near the Strait of Hormuz!
In addition to all of this, the US Army has rushed into Kuwait three combat
brigades. Two are powerful mechanized brigades (one from the First Cavalry
Division; the other from the MN National Guard) and the third is a Army
aviation brigade with its vast numbers of attack and assault helicopters.
Thousands of USAF troops were airlifted into Israel along with the most
advanced anti-missile technology that America has over the last two weeks.
Both Russia and China have been very vocal in opposing any new war in the
Middle East. However,
Russian warnings have been very clear,
stating that any attack on Tehran would be considered an attack on Moscow.
To make this point crystal clear, the Russian
Strategic Missile Forces have suddenly begun a 'High Alert Drill' according
to
RiaNovosti this "drill" involves the latest
and most dangerous nuclear-armed Russian ICBMs:
Russias Strategic Missile Forces are
holding a series of exercises to practice putting road-mobile missile
systems on high alert, SMF spokesman Col. Vadim Koval said.
The exercises involve Topol (SS-25 Sikle), Topol-M (SS-27 Sickle B) and
Yars (RS-24) mobile systems stationed in central Russia and Siberia.
SMF units armed with Topol, Topol-M and
Yars road-mobile missile systems will practice patrolling,
camouflaging and launch preparation procedures during high alert
drills from January 16 to February 3, Koval told reporters on
Monday.
While the world's attention is on the GOP
Presidential race and the Eurozone crisis, war clouds are gathering in the
Middle East and the entire planet is at risk.
A risk that is greater than that it faced almost
half a century ago with the Cuban Missile Crisis.
