A New Global Economic Restructuring

James Martinez reads a
statement from representatives of a new global currency
that is being announced and slowly integrated into our
consciousness as a way to end the tyranny of the current
banking systems.
Conscious Media Network (CMN) has been approached by a
representative of global leaders and financiers from 130 nations to
broadcast a statement about a new global economic restructuring arising in
2012.
The statement is delivered via a video-taped interview with a layperson on
behalf of the consortium that has been working behind the scenes, on the
problem of the unsustainable global economy for the past 8 years.
The party who drafted this statement has stated,
in response to conspiracy concerns, that,
The usual suspects are not the suspects,
...and that
the Global Elite also understand
that the unsecured, digital money system has failed us all, including
themselves.
This announcement is to serve as the introduction of a New Global Economic
Structure that will begin surfacing in 2012.
Those involved in this plan are calling it the
greatest humanitarian effort in modern history. It will be for each of us
to determine over time if this is a truthful statement.
CMN is serving as a neutral party for this broadcast and what it claims, as
the economic consortium does not wish to break this news through mainstream
media at this time. Please give this your serious attention, as it may be
heralding a new way of conducting commerce on the planet that will effect us
all well into our future. It will be through our understanding and
acceptance that this will happen.
A portion of this plan does include a dissolution of debt in a carefully
considered and planned way. The plan itself is paradigm shattering, and only
hinted at in this above video-taped statement.
There will be more to come throughout the year.
Read the announcement below:
Neither banks nor public authorities (or
mainstream academics, for that matter) calculated the economys
realistic ability to pay - that is, to pay without shrinking the
economy.
Through their media and think tanks, they
have convinced populations that the way to get rich most rapidly is to
borrow money to buy real estate, stocks and bonds rising in price -
being inflated by bank credit - and to reverse the past centurys
progressive taxation of wealth.
To put matters bluntly, the result has been junk economics. Its aim is
to disable public checks and balances, shifting planning power into the
hands of high finance on the claim that this is more efficient than
public regulation.
Government planning and taxation is accused
of being the road to serfdom, as if free markets controlled by
bankers given leeway to act recklessly is not planned by special
interests in ways that are oligarchic, not democratic.
Governments are told to pay bailout debts
taken on not to defend countries in military warfare as in times past,
but to benefit the wealthiest layer of the population by shifting its
losses onto taxpayers.
The failure to take the wishes of voters into consideration leaves the
resulting national debts on shaky ground politically and even legally.
Debts imposed by fiat, by governments or
foreign financial agencies in the face of strong popular opposition may
be as tenuous as those of the Habsburgs and other despots in past
epochs. Lacking popular validation, they may die with the regime that
contracted them.
New governments may act democratically to
subordinate the banking and financial sector to serve the economy, not
the other way around.
Debt Slavery - Why It Destroyed Rome, Why It Will
Destroy Us Unless It's Stopped - Hammurabi Knew Better
Voluminous media reports of ongoing global
economic carnage may lead one to take the view that our world does not
understand the fundamentals of economics that ancient world leaders such as
Hammurabi, Egyptian Pharoahs, and even Roman Emperors knew very well.
The truth is quite simply that debt based economies - money as debt with all
its intrinsic inequality and poverty - is eternally fated for destruction.
Ancient despots were anything but humanitarians. Like all despots throughout
history they were driven by self interest.
But did they recognize at least that a fair
economic system is in everyones best interest?
Given our dire economic circumstance it is forgivable that we little people
despair and wring our hands. The prevailing view of the little people is
that we are powerless to effect great change. We may feel that we have
awoken only in enough time to spectate as world leaders stare
uncomprehendingly at yet another inevitable global collapse.
It is not that world leaders or financial leaders and economists too
numerous to even mention have failed to notice the collapse of the current
financial system.
In this regard, refer to the comments of Sir Mervyn King, Governor
the Bank of England, and the comments of Stephen Green as HSBC
Chairman, and the comments of
the Pope, and the very recent
comments of President
Barack Obama plus many, many others.
All of these views are from the unique
perspective of each individual but there is a common thread.
The comments of Stephen Green are of particular interest. Mr. Green remarks
that Milton Friedman was completely wrong (profit only - nothing else
matters) but Mr. Green is still compelled to support free market economics.
He quotes Sir Winston Churchill who
famously stated:
The market is the worst system of economic
and social development - except for all the others that have been tried
from time to time.
So the thought is that although free market
capitalism is the very worst system, nothing else works either. Socialism,
capitalism, communism all fail. There are no credible working isms then.
Churchills comments should be acknowledged by
all of us.
-
So what can we do?
-
Can we only create more debt and
accelerate the decline?
-
Are we all - governments, little
individuals, and institutions - powerless?
The solution is the creation of a new financial
system that that is endowed with the most powerful economic tools the world
has ever known.
It is not an ism. It is commerce aimed at the
creation of scalable affluence for the greatest number of people within a
sustainable, asset backed bubble up global economy.
It is an institution for the purpose of providing benevolence for all of
humanity, regardless of color, worldview or place on earth. All of this
without the creation of debt and without causing harm to the interests of
others, no matter if they are great or small.
Although it is known today only by a handful of people throughout the world
it nevertheless exists within a mighty and powerful new system that has been
created and managed by little people.
It has already begun with little people. Little people are the most powerful
force on earth.
Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, states,
of all the many ways of organizing banking
the worst is the one we have today

Extract from article on speech of Stephen Green:
"American free market economics guru Milton
Friedman was wrong to assert that companies should focus on shareholder
value above all other considerations," HSBC Chairman Stephen Green
declared.

Extract of article from speech of Barack Obama
in Kansas:
Now, just as there was in Teddy Roosevelts
time, there is a certain crowd in Washington who, for the last few
decades, have said, lets respond to this economic challenge with the
same old tune.
The market will take care of
everything, they tell us.
If we just cut more regulations and cut more
taxes - especially for the wealthy - our economy will grow stronger.
Sure, they say, there will be winners and
losers. But if the winners do really well, then jobs and prosperity will
eventually trickle down to everybody else. And, they argue, even if
prosperity doesnt trickle down, well, thats the price of liberty.
Now, its a simple theory. And we have to
admit, its one that speaks to our rugged individualism and our healthy
skepticism of too much government. Thats in Americas DNA. And that
theory fits well on a bumper sticker.
But heres the problem: It doesnt work. It
has never worked. It didnt work when it was tried in the decade before
the Great Depression. Its not what led to the incredible postwar booms
of the 50s and 60s. And it didnt work when we tried it during the last
decade.
I mean, understand, its not as if we
havent tried this theory.

Extract of article concerning Popes 2009
encyclical urging an ethical financial system:
The economy needs ethics in order to
function correctly, not any ethics, but an ethics which is people
centered, the Pope says.
Above all, the intention to do good must not be considered incompatible
with the effective capacity to produce goods, the Associated Press
quotes him saying.
Financiers must rediscover the genuinely ethical
foundation of their activity so as to not abuse the sophisticated
instruments which can serve to betray the interests of savers.

A CMN viewer spotted a German video with
subtitles that may help to understand the changes that are being considered
(these are not the same people as being spoken of in the video above):
Important Clarification on Global Currency
January 5, 2012
We have learned from the source of the video statement on a new global
economic restructuring that there is no intention or requirement to
substitute national currencies with a single new one.
They are simply saying that a new secured type of currency that does not
include traditional compound interest bearing debt will be made available
that is to be used for the purposes of initiating a larger plan.
The currencies that currently exist are going to succeed or fail on their
own merits. Many of the major currencies have already shown signs of their
lack of structural integrity.
It is said to be based on a new system of doing business that allows for the
support of the 99% of human beings who have not had the necessary support
from traditional banking institutions.
He says that the initial introduction of some elements of the plan should
become visible in the near future.
We will post this and more updates as we receive them.
In the frenzy of news of such magnitude, assumptions are made and mistaken
perspectives occur. After communication amongst the global alternative news
community, a consensus appears to be emerging.
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING:
January 9th 2012
Announcement from Benjamin Fulford
Weekly Geopolitical News and Analysis20120109
The Feds have sued for peace and detailed settlement
negotiations have begun
In a very major development, the Federal Reserve Board faction that is
in de-facto control of the Obama regime and Israel has approached the
White Dragon Society to negotiate a way to unfreeze their funds.
They have promised to use any released funds
for humanitarian projects and to develop hitherto forbidden technology.
The 130-nation group that announced a new financial system through the
Conscious Media Network on January 1st also contacted the White Dragon
Society and said they will prove with action, and not words, that they
represent extremely powerful interests.
This writer initially, and apparently
incorrectly, denounced the announcement as a psy-ops because this group
was not identical to the 117 nation Monaco group previously reported
about in this newsletter.
All of these major factions will now have to reach an agreement.
There will some serious horse-trading over
the coming weeks before any sort of agreement is reached or public
announcement is made but it appears a solution to the financial crisis
is now on the horizon.
