Were people consciously aware something
was about to change in a very bad way just before Lenin and Trotsky
appeared on the scene in Petrograd in the spring of 1917?
-
Did the German people realize accepting
the 'hope' of Hitler would result in something so hideous and evil
that tens of millions of people would die and a permanent bloodstain
would appear on the history of Germany?
-
What was life like months or years
before the Armenians suffered genocide at the hands of the Turks,
did they know that government imposed gun control was really
disarmament before extermination?
-
How about the Chinese before the tyrant
Mao, or the North Koreans before the Kim Jung il family infestation?
-
Did these people know what was coming,
but didn't know what they could do?
Most of written history is written on pages of
blood.
I think today, right now, is another one of
those moments just before something very bad is about to happen. And, this
time, we have the written historical records of bad news to learn
potentially lifesaving, culture-rescuing information before we slip into
another example of blood and carnage insanity.
Although Sigmund Freud introduced the world to the word psychopath
in his book Psychopathology of Everyday Life, published in 1901, it
wouldn't be until forty years later that a true definition of
psychopathology was developed to include the personality type of psychopath:
a scientific understanding that sheds light on past and current events.
One of the first researchers to study and document the nature of personality
types called psychopaths was Hervey Cleckley, MD, in his book
The Mask of Sanity, published in 1941.
In this classic work, Cleckley spent
considerable time with prison inmates in Georgia; prisoners that,
"little agreement was found as to what was
actually the matter with them."
And, according to Cleckley,
"[the prisoners] continued, however, to
constitute a most grave and a constant problem to the hospital and to
the community."
In addition to Cleckley, others in the time
since 1941 have contributed significantly to our understanding of the
psychopathic personality type.
One such heroic researcher was Andrew M.
Lobaczewski, born 1921 in Poland.
After suffering Nazi occupation during WWII, and
Russian occupation after Germany's defeat, Lobaczewski entered college to be
trained as a psychologist, and soon thereafter began research into the
nature of the psychopath. Lobaczewski and his colleagues risked severe
penalties, including death, for documenting their research and
experimentation.
Many decades would pass trying to get the work published (and many attempts
were made by groups to destroy it).
But, finally, in 1998, circumventing
attempts of
Zbigniew Brzezinski
to stop the publication, Lobaczewski's book
Political Ponerology - A science on the nature of evil
for political purposes was published.
The book begins with an examination of
prisoners, much like Cleckley's work covers, but this time scientists
correlated the behavior of psychopaths with the depravity of massively
oppressive political regimes; the results of which culminated in a new
science he called Ponerology, the study of evil in man. Political Ponerology,
then, is the nature of evil in politics.
According to Lobaczewski, organizations can become infested with
psychopathic personality types who, if given the proper amount of time and
growing conditions, will busily fill all positions of power within it.
In the case of governments, what emerges is
defined as a pathocracy:
tyranny at the hand of psychopaths.
Lobaczewski defined governance by a pathocracy
as a macrosocial disease, something unhealthy and brutally deadly if
untreated.
The book Political Ponerology provides a scary explanation for
periodic times of brutal insanity in the history of the world. It is a light
to scientifically expose a particular personality type within populations -
a type, if left alone, will infest positions of power, pushing out normal
personalities until they dominate the power structure.
From a position of total domination, psychopaths
will aggressively and brutally protect the power they have gained. In the
case of government, that means taking steps to eradicate any perceived
opposition to their control and authority.
Since true psychopaths are emotionally dead, and
work empathy-free (see Dr. Robert Hare's book Without Conscience; The
Disturbing World of Psychopaths), the task of cleaning house to prevent
loss of control can quickly evolve into the 20-million-plus killed in the
Russian Holocaust, the 60-million-plus killed in the Chinese Holocaust, or
the extermination camps of the Jewish Holocaust.
Although not on the same scale, recent mass
murders such as the Waco Texas massacre, the Oklahoma City bombings, or the
9-11 false flag terror-murders should sound the warning alarms. Psychopaths
are afoot.
This brings me to the deplorable historical events in the United States,
especially since 1913. Are psychopaths running the show? Lets look at some
facts.
To set the stage, in 1912 bankers rig the presidential election and Woodrow
Wilson, the bankers president, moves into the White House. This is a
strategic move to ensure prompt penmanship on banker bills.
Then, two days before Christmas, while Congress was conveniently low on
members gone for the break, a private banking cartel shrewdly gave the
Federal Reserve control over the issuance of United States currency.
The finagling was done using deception and
bribery, and the trick of bringing bills to vote when congressional
attendance was very low. As of today, 'banker currency' has lost 98 percent
of its original purchasing power; purchasing power lost by dollar holders
was transferred as wealth to government and owners of the Federal Reserve.
Since 1913, the United States has started or insinuated (through false flag
events) itself in non-retaliatory wars on the average of one every 15 years
including:
-
WWI
-
WWII
-
the Korean Conflict
-
the Vietnam War
-
the first Gulf War
-
the second Gulf War
All of these wars were funded with borrowed
money from the very same banks issuing the currency, thus saddling tax
payers with interest and principal in addition to the cost of lives.
Even after the wars, US underwriters have funded
the continued exportation of war and empire through occupation, building
more than 1000 military bases in over 150 nations around the world.
In addition to the offshore wars, the United States has prosecuted an ever
increasing war on its citizens, including,
-
relentless assaults on freedoms provided
by the Constitution and Bill of Rights
-
the effective disempowering of congress
via geometric growth in governance by Executive Order
-
continuing attempts to disarm citizens,
using deception and fear to legislate away the right to keep and
bear arms
The war on US citizens is prosecuted around the
clock with assaults on many fronts, including,
-
a deliberate effort to dumb down
the educational system
-
debasing health through
contamination of foods (hormones,
pesticides,
GMOs, chemically adulterated water,
cancerous additives such as
aspartame)
-
protecting food cartels that provide
fewer food choices while controlling your right to grow food
Healthcare choices are restricted by legal
protection of
pharmaceutical cartels marketing drug and
medical procedures responsible for hundreds of thousands of needless deaths
each year.
The government directly attacks the individual
immune system by mandating and promoting criminally contaminated vaccines -
immune system damaging vaccines that may also cause long term brain
dysfunction or damage, or result in delayed cancer.
Personal finances are attacked with,
-
escalating tax rates levied by
exponentially growing mega-state(s)
-
taxes draining the vital economic blood
needed for growth, while shackling citizens to increasing hours of
work
-
depreciating dollars and falling wages
And don't expect any help from the free market;
it's been outlawed.
The government (federal, state, local) is now
the largest employer in the nation and private manufacturing is deliberately
off-shored to foreign countries. Open borders inviting the deliberate influx
of millions of illegal aliens are overwhelming social service and legal
systems and pressuring wages lower as illegals compete with unfair wage
advantages.
Financial disaster is manufactured, as private
bankers in charge of our monetary system invent and market fraudulent
financial products, encourage fraudulent loans, and produce a false bubble
in home prices. Then, as the deflating bubble exposes the fraud, ownership
becomes uncertain when we learn property titles were criminally misplaced.
Finally, let's note the 2 million homes in
foreclosure or foreclosed upon since the housing bust, and another 2 million
in the pipe.
Most of these properties are held off market by
banks and government agencies (Fannie and Freddie). That puts the government
and the Federal Reserve in charge of the largest real estate holdings in the
country.
Disturbing fact: Socialist and Communist regimes
provide no right of private property - the state owns it all.
Americans are deliberately terrified as government, controlled by bankers,
creates false terror and criminally incites fear to restrict travel, destroy
privacy, control the Internet and news content, manipulate the voting
process, and silence free speech. Americans are assailed by false government
promises made during elections and by a growing prison-police-industrial
cartel incarcerating growing numbers of citizens, while using prisoners as
slaves.
More people are incarcerated in the United
States than any other nation on earth and the rate of incarceration is
growing.
Prison manufacturing now constitutes 35% of
total United States manufacturing. Autogenous terror is no less scary or
health disturbing than real terror - a deliberate assault on the American
psyche.
For the elderly and persons of retirement age, the assault has just begun -
pensions and retirement accounts are being gutted and stolen by bankers and
a bankrupt government. Just as the baby boomers are hitting retirement age
their pensions and retirement investments are stolen, squandered and
deflated.
Promises made while stealing your income will
never be kept, as the economic life blood is sucked dry by bankers and
criminally bankrupt governments from the many states to Washington DC.
Finally, the assault continues as the USG,
slowly dying from bankruptcy and rampant corruption, relentlessly (and
against popular support) continues to prosecute two illegal, non
retaliatory, wars six thousand miles from home.
These wars support a growing worldwide hatred of
the insane, brutal and irrational acts of the United States, while
exploiting Americans through promotion of illegal drugs mainlined through
government transportation and distribution; drugs sold at monopoly prices
because of the deliberate
War On Drugs, resulting in the prosecution
of drug users to fill prisons at an increasing rate.
Just when you think it couldn't get more in your face comes the outright
theft in broad daylight of TRILLIONS of dollars through pretended efforts to
'save the economy.'
Most of the money has been created from nothing
only to reduce purchasing power of the dollar and simultaneously create a
need to raise taxes to cover interest on the newly minted debt.
The
stolen TRILLIONS are hastily sent to crony banks both at home and
off shore. When Americans asked, "Where did the money go?" the arrogant
criminals-in-charge continue to flatly refuse to reveal the recipients.
This crime against all Americans is deliberate
and aggressive, as it is done in the light of day, taunting anyone to try
and stop it.
The financial crisis has been prosecuted deliberately for so long now that
the economy likely is only one major economic shock away from several
possible financial catastrophes - the most likely being a debt-related
collapse, say, an insolvent and bankrupt large corporation (GE) or bank (BAC)?
The result would be a financial derivatives
chain reaction leaving a slew of companies around the world in financial
ruin, while those events cause a run on the dollar or a move to dump
treasuries; the last manufactured bubble popping like faulty rivets
exploding as the Titanic bobs for the last time, slipping terminally into
the sea.
After that, the crisis would take on a life of
its own with food and oil prices skyrocketing and Homeland Security rounding
up early discontents for incarceration in already pre-planned and ready-made
prisons strategically located throughout the United States.
Since 1913 bankers and crony corporations have consolidated and now control
all mainstream media. TV, satellite, radio, newspapers and magazines - all
controlled by the same 5 or 6 corporate media companies. Can we expect
truthful news and responsible journalism?
Taken individually it may be possible to argue that mistakes in thinking
resulted in poor choices giving license to bad endings, but the history of,
-
deliberate lies
-
endless bloodshed in manufactured wars
-
aggression against people using food,
health, and finances
-
the non-stop assault on personal
liberties
using false flag terror,
...is a plain-as-day indication that Americans
will face a deadly crisis in the near future.
For the record: moves to disarm citizens always
precede escalating physical control by a maniacal state. Always...
I submit that the United States government is under the control of
psychopaths, and the infestation is nearing completion; the point at which
nothing can stop the oncoming violence.
But that's not all, because above the federal
government is a ruling cartel of off-shore psychopaths that have secretly
been planning a one-world tyranny for more than 100 years. This is not a
rant; it is a plea: take time to read the material.
According to Lobaczewski:
In a pathocracy, all leadership
positions, (down to village headman and community cooperative managers,
not to mention the directors of police units, and special services
police personnel, and activists in the pathocratic party) must be filled
by individuals with corresponding psychological deviations, which are
inherited as a rule.
However, such people constitute a very small
percentage of the population and this makes them more valuable to the
pathocrats.
Their intellectual level or professional
skills cannot be taken into account, since people representing superior
abilities (who are also psychopaths) are even harder to find.
After such a system has lasted several
years, one hundred percent of all the cases of essential psychopathy are
involved in pathocratic activity; they are considered the most loyal,
even though some of them were formerly involved on the other side in
some way.
Under such conditions, no area of social life can develop normally,
whether in economics, culture, science, technology, administration, etc.
Pathocracy progressively paralyzes everything.
Normal people must develop a level of
patience beyond the ken of anyone living in a normal man's system just
in order to explain what to do and how to do it to some obtuse
mediocrity of a psychological deviant who has been placed in charge of
some project that he cannot even understand, much less manage.
This special kind of pedagogy - instructing
deviants while avoiding their wrath - requires a great deal of time and
effort, but it would otherwise not be possible to maintain tolerable
living conditions and necessary achievements in the economic area or
intellectual life of a society.
Even with such efforts, pathocracy
progressively intrudes everywhere and dulls everything. [...]
Therefore, to mitigate the threat to their
power, the pathocrats must employ any and all methods of terror and
exterminatory policies against individuals known for their patriotic
feelings and military training.
Other, specific "indoctrination" activities such
as those we have presented are also utilized.
Individuals lacking the natural feeling of being
linked to normal society become irreplaceable in either of these activities.
Again, the foreground of this type of activity is occupied by cases of
essential psychopathy, followed by those with similar anomalies, and finally
by people alienated from the society in question as a result of racial or
national differences.
The phenomenon of pathocracy matures during this period: an extensive and
active indoctrination system is built, with a suitably refurbished ideology
constituting the vehicle or Trojan horse for the purpose of pathologizing
the thought processes of individuals and society.
The goal - forcing human minds to incorporate
pathological experiential methods and thought-patterns, and consequently
accepting such rule - is never openly admitted.
This goal is conditioned by pathological
egotism, and the possibility of accomplishing it strikes the pathocrats as
not only indispensable, but feasible.
From the murder of John F. Kennedy to the trail of dead bodies
uncovered during the
Clinton and
Bush regimes,
and now
Obama - the sanity of
American government has taken a terrible turn toward Pathocracy.
Normal Americans have to stop making excuses for
what is plain view.
It is time that humanity faces what it already knows: Historic suffering
throughout the ages is related to
the evil of the psychopath. We must never
consent to being disarmed.
Thomas Jefferson said:
"No free man shall ever be debarred the use
of arms. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep
and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against
tyranny in government."
Next, I call on psychology and psychiatry
professionals to make claims regarding the mental health of members of
government - it is incumbent on those qualified to take a stand against a
rising, bloody, tyranny.
The facts speak for themselves: mental health
must be called into consideration based on the actions of our leaders in
recent years.
Finally, there are other powerful, peaceful ways to reign in the power of
psychopaths.
First and foremost, remember that it is the
overwhelming numbers of normal people that enable their power, working and
slaving away in a system designed as life support for a class of vampires. I
submit that we can stop paying their bills.
Start by cutting off the fuel supply, i.e., their funding. Banks are power
lines connected directly to the coven of vampires; currency is the current
flowing through the power lines. Begin today by removing any savings you
might have in banks and in various investment markets (stocks, bonds, hedge
funds, etc. ), then use those dollars to buy physical gold and silver and
long term food supplies.
These commodities hold their value in the face
of deliberately depreciating currency.
Next - this is the interesting part - never
convert your gold and silver back into dollars. Instead, when the time comes
spend your silver and gold. Go out and find small local stores that will
trade gold and silver for supplies.
Remember, if you convert your gold and silver
back into money the vampires get power - the IRS will tax your trade, and
the banks end up with money streaming down the power lines to the coven of
vampires.
Moving out of the banking matrix toward barter and transactions based in
real money will protect your privacy and purchasing power, while decreasing
energy available for evil. A grade 'A' investment for the average American
(aside from food) is silver; silver is the currency of the little man - it
is the silver bullet against the vampire of psychopathic government.
This is a critical time in the history of humanity; a time when you have to
educate yourself and have courage to take non-violent action against a very
violent infestation of the worst possible personality types.
Think about the Russians, Germans, Chinese and
so many others that might have been able to prevent a blood bath of agony
with just some responsible action prior to the onslaught.
I would also say it is important to understand
that psychopaths have no emotions and no empathy. Think about what kind of
person would order the deliberate down-the-pants aggression of "security"
agents.
These people are not protecting you - they are
groping you like animals; animals that have no future other than food for
the psychopaths.
Take action today...
