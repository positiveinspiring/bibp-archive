The vision of Googles future, according to Google co-founder, Sergey
Brin, is,
"it would be like the mind of God".
And its a future that theyre working
feverishly to make a reality today.
While that quote was in reference to the ultimate search engine, this
analysis is going to make it more than clear that he was in fact
referring to Google in particular. In doing so, well see numerous other
quotes demonstrating their intentions, what they mean by all of the worlds
information, how theyre on precisely the right path to achieve their goal
with the U.S. military in this vast project that is set to change
humanity forever.
AI (artificial intelligence) is actually too narrow of a term for
a cognitive system, but a broad cognitive system would contain many narrow
AI parts. To even contemplate the notion of cognitive Artificial General
Intelligence one must first embrace emergence. Emergence is the key
to all complex systems that could be considered in attempting to create a
model for an AGI system.
Googles methodology in their quest is to
exploit and harness the powers of emergence, while adding parts
that perform cognitive tasks in their own right. The idea is to push the
term super-organism to the fullest potential. The insights are the
ant colony, and the beehive.
The models are the Internet, and the
human brain. The entire premise of emergence is the sum is greater than
its parts.
Ants are abysmally stupid, in our terms, yet the colony as a super-organism
often gives rise to give the impression of the individual ants being
intelligent. With beehives this feature expands even further. Under the
right conditions, a complex systems analysis of the collective can be
indistinguishable from that as a single organism. Compare this to cells in
the human body, or brain alone.
Each human mind is a hive, of neurons; a
hivemind.
Each neuron is abysmally stupid, and each brain
part is nearly worthless alone, yet the interconnected cells of each part
and each part interconnected give rise to consciousness and higher brain
functions.
Then theres the Internet, with its millions of routers and billions of
computers all interconnected as one that is already evolving into a smart
semantic web on its own. Its no wonder that philosophers often compare the
Internet - as a complex system - to the brain, and many thinkers argue that
at some point the Internet itself may become unintendedly conscious via
emergence.
But what if a collective of intelligent beings
harnessing global scale supercomputers armed with state of the art
algorithms made the goal of turning their symbiotic co-evolving component of
the Internet their lifes work?
Enter Google: Google seeks to gather & organize, in their words, all of
the worlds information.
Its the company slogan, and when you hear them
speak it they place much emphasis on all. But whats more, according to
both co-founders of the company, they intend for it to understand what all
of the worlds information means. In many cases, theyre going to extremes in
order to gather all of it, but theyre lettings us do the work for them
wherever they can.
A look over their Product list is as far as
one must go to get an idea, yet it goes further than that.
But first, the main search feature must be
highlighted.
Google, like other search engines, crawls the Internet. That is,
their algorithm laden interconnected supercomputer automatons scour the
Internet, link-by-link literally archiving the entire history of the
Internet, page by page, day by day. A page changes and Google finds the
change and adds it to its own archives. It then saves these archives for all
time.
This includes content from social networks,
blogs, news sites, and so forth. Feeding a link into
Archive.orgs Wayback Machine paints a
candid picture of this process. Their urgency to archive all possible
acquirable data also extends to other areas, such as your personal life
via Gmail, Health, Calendar & Google Desktop (which scans all of the
files in your personal computer) .
Another technique is the transfer of human intelligence, which involves
monitoring our behavior as we surf the Web and more. This is achieved via
many routes, such as the standard Google Search, Google cookies, Google
Toolbar (that embeds in most web browser programs), Google Desktop, sites
with AdSense integrated, Powered by Google complete site integration, and
last-but-not-least their new Google Chrome web-browser.
Add to that
Docs and Knol.
There isnt even room in this article to explain the ramifications that each
one of their Products poses in what its set to understand about
yourself & your habits, and everything about the human race from the genetic
to the social scale.
But note their new Android mobile device
service, which has 2 alarming features.
-
First, is one app that records the users
iris scan, for login purposes.
-
Second, nearly every other app
encourages the use of real-time navigational GPS tracking.
So on one hand it conditions you to submit your
eye iris scans, and on the other it conditions you to embrace constant
real-time GPS tracking of your every move. The latter is dually striking as
virtually all modern cell phones already embody GPS tracking, except most
people arent yet aware of that.
In other cases they go out of their way to acquire their data: Google
Books, Patent Search, Scholar, Maps & Street View, Earth, Translate, Finance
and now even Newspaper (archiving the history of all possible print
newspapers).
For some insight into the implications of their
machine eventually having in its intellectual possession virtually the
entire history of humanitys books, newspaper, scholarly academic papers and
so forth, consider the statement from a Google Factory Tour guide:
We are not scanning all those books to be
read by people, we are scanning them to be read by an AI.
The point is proven in the fact that theyre
scanning the entire books whether or not the entire contents will be
browsable online. Perhaps my publishing of this article online is giving the
Machine even more focused insight into itself?
Then theres the darker side.
-
First, they intend to - if not already -
use your PCs microphone to monitor background audio in order to
listen to TVs and so forth to garner better ads for the user. As
US intelligence agencies already monitor subjects via their
cell phone microphones, which can only be prevented by removing the
phones battery, you can expect Google equipped mobile devices
and automobiles to do the same.
-
Second, another goal is acquiring every
persons DNA code, and then making it searchable online as
another Product. This could prove to be their most challenging
ambition, but in Google tradition theyve rolled out the (on the
surface) independent 23andMe
social networking personalized genome service which is already
showing signs of targeting children for systematic indoctrination in
DNA databanks.
Much of their epic archiving quest wont even
immediately pay off, but its being kept as fruit waiting to ripen, or
rather waiting for their conscious entity to ripen to be able to harness it.
By this point many would declare that AGI isnt possible, but regardless of
beliefs and possibilities (external possibilities arent dependent on one
persons beliefs), the stated goal exists.
Peter Norvig, former head of the now Intelligent Systems Division
at NASAs ARC, and now Googles Director of Research, in 2007,
claimed that Google is already co-evolving with the Internet.
We hadnt expected that, he said.
But the Googlers seem to be right on course to
reach their ambitions by conscious direction of that delves beyond mere
emergence alone. There are many cases of the 2 Google co-founders going on
the record about AI, and between them and their related medias, its
quite clear that their intentions arent merely narrow AI nor is any of it
mere accident.
Take for instance machine vision.
Begin with Google Video and shortly
afterwards they acquired Youtube. These are both sites where the user
does the work in providing the profitable content for them. For some it was
neat for Youtube results to appear in Google Video searches, but then Google
began crawling most of all other streaming video hosts including many of
their competitors.
During that shuffle, Google acquired Neven
Vision, the worlds most advanced machine vision firm. One desirable
prospect for Google was that NVs technology was already geared for mobile
devices. Another was that it was designed for both still photos and videos.
It can be understood as advanced biometrics thats designed to recognize all
types of objects, not just human faces.
So while youre walking around your neighborhood waving your GPS equipped
Google mobile device around, its possible that Google is storing your
cameras data in building Googles omnipresent worlds eye.
But I see a scarier side: When their infantile
systems grow conscious enough, not only would they - or It - know and
understand everything humanity has ever written, it would also have to a
certain degree all of our videos from film to personal cams.
One side is it helps it become sentient, the
other is it accelerates its ability to understand humans individually and
socially. After all, you couldnt expect a machine to become conscious &
intelligent without vision, nor could it understand humans without
seeing them in action.
An intelligent thinking machine would also needs ears, and ears they are
giving it. Make a call to 1-800-GOOG411 and experience their speech
recognition algorithms for yourself. No surprise that the service is free,
because the more people use it the more you help them reach their goal of
omniscience. And its safe to assume to this technology is busy helping
it listen to all of the videos its looking at.
Meanwhile, their Translate efforts has
their system rapidly learning how to translate any language from any
language, guided by a handful of engineers who in most cases dont even know
the languages themselves. You can see this by doing the typical search, and
you can bet theyre already working on integrating the technology into audio
speech recognition.
Above we have the perfect outline of inherent rise of sentience via
emergence, but they arent leaving it to just that.
In May of 2008, Google hosted their own Machine
Learning Summit, of which,
most of the material covered (documents,
videos, presentations) at these types of events is confidential and
proprietary and cant be released.
Prior to that, in 2006, internal documents
leaked stating their plans the build the worlds largest AI laboratory.
That lab might be already existent somewhere in their own properties, or it
might be in or set to be in a government / military facility.
The facility could be in one of their many data-centers or other secretive
locations. A secretive data-center of public fame is known best as PROJECT02,
which has direct access to cheap power via a hydroelectric damn owned and
operated by the US Army Corp of Engineers.
Being the size of 2 football fields, it sounds
reminiscent of what everyone used to say in reference to the NSAs
Echelon
system that was and is used to monitor virtually every form of
telecommunications in the US and much of the Earth.
Theres no telling how many Google facilities exist, but is can be said that
they wouldnt need one centralized location for the worlds largest AI lab.
With global telecommunications now being radically different than 60 years
ago, private intranets can connect up any remote office or personal computer
as a collective. This means that a modern day Manhattan Project could be
operated across the planet in secret with great ease.
This would especially be the case if you had
literally a million or more parallel platformed CPUs at your disposal (like
Google does). Consider that computing power per $1000 is literally less than
millionth what was during the Manhattan Project, and that project only cost
about US$24 billion.
Anything even resembling a modern semiconductor
computer hadnt even been invented yet. Meanwhile, every year their
capabilities expand as CPU prices drop and work gets easier, exponentially,
thanks to
Moores Law and the
Law of Accelerating Returns.
On the surface, Google seems to be poised to be able go it alone in their
effort, yet they are in deep cahoots with the US militarys parallel
initiative.
Since the US military maintains global
supremacy via its Navy, one could almost Google to roll out plans for
naval data-centers (which they have). The full scope of government &
military involvement with Googles AGI project goes well beyond the
scope of this analysis, but suffice to say that Google have in 2008 signed a
40-90 year lease, with their geographical neighbors, at NASAs Ames
Research Center (ARC), in Silicon Valley, for a 1.2 million
square feet collaborative research facility.
But not only does Google get to build on the
government land there, they already have exclusive access to land and park
their private Google jumbo jets on ARCs Moffitt Field.
Moffitt Field.
ARC is historically NASAs prime hub of AI & AGI research, so its of
little surprise that Sergey Brin, when asked about the partnership,
repeatedly mentioned AI as the primary strategic interest. Also relevant
in this summary, is the fact that Google was initially funded by
DARPA,
NASA, and the
National Science Foundation.
Its also been alleged by a former CIA
agent that not only did the CIA fund them during their earlier years, but
that the CIA has an actual office in the main Googleplex headquarters,
while its a fact that Google hardware runs the US Intelligence Communitys
spy
wikipedia. DARPA claims the fame of inventing the Internet, and
by visiting their website you can browse through their extensive list of
various inter-related cognitive self-aware artificial intelligence
projects.
Vint Cerf, Googles Chief Internet
Evangelist VP, invented the Internet together with Bob Kahn via
DARPA. Vint still works with NASA on the Interplanetary Internet, as well
as on other projects for the United States military.
Lastly, in terms of a so-called god on earth status, Larry Page has
stated the desires to get started on climate
modification, a dream of military strategists since ancient
times. Fostering such a sentiment with Googles de-facto
government-operation status via NASA & DARPA, humanity doesnt just face
whatever typically assumed degrees of computer control by the omnipresent
and omniscient Machine, the Machine is on the path of geophysical
omnipotence.
NASA, in recent years, has pursued the perfect
program to mesh with this. The goal of the Intelligent Archives sounds
familiar to everything Google is doing in terms of understanding massive
amounts of data. They even used the phrases self-aware and cognitive.
The projects webpage now speak in the past tense, and its unclear its true
status after its parent division became the Intelligent Systems Division.
In any case, with deep integration with NASA and
their Earth sciences, and the military and their hundreds of top secret
satellites, and AI all in-between, Id say Page has found the perfect
scenario to pursue this dream.
In closing, lets just say that Google manages to actually understand what
the data in its own text data-holdings means. This could be kept simply
between webpages and books. Consider hundreds of thousands of texts related
to related to programming languages and software engineering (essentially
everything on the subject).
By using Google Search we can tell the
system is very much in perpetual tune with its own complete data-holdings.
One could argue that theyre flirting with
hard-takeoff AGI emergence on this front alone. And if you spend enough
time putting complex worded search strings into
Google Calculator and Code Search you might
help make that a reality.
Imagine what it would mean if the Google co-founders get their wish of
Google being directly connected to human minds via neural interface.
That might make people reconsider that Google
fought for the new wireless Internet spectrum, and are working to bring 3
billion new people the Internet, good things.
