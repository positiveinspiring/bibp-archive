President Obama, during his election campaign in
2008, was focused on the promise that America would
lead the world on climate change.
Obama declared that the US would
reduce CO2 emissions by 2050 and invest $150 billion in green technologies.
At the heart of his agenda was a cap-and-trade bill.
One of Obamas
endeavors was allocating $60 million of taxpayer money to
Abound Solar,
a bankrupt solar energy corporation out of Colorado owned by Valerie
Jarrett.
Jarrett is currently under criminal investigation and Abound Solar
is out of business which means she took the money and left town.
To show his support for the globalist schemes
concerning global warming, Obama
attended the 2009 UN Copenhagen Climate Summit and gave a speech about
converging the US to bow down to international mandates on climate change.
In a
study
from an eco-fascist outfit called Surging Seas, areas along coastal lines in
the continental US are under threat of rising sea levels which threaten the
populations living in states such as Florida, Louisiana, California, New
York and New Jersey.
Another alarmist
study focusing on cities across the globe that are endanger of coastal
flooding due to climate change assesses financial risks associated with
allowing urban populations to live along coasts in various countries and
governmental protection measures that should be enacted to mitigate further
damage caused by the reckless attitude
toward global 'warming.'
Coastal cities are expected to witness the most
incredible surge in population due to consistent urbanization and the advent
of
megaregions.
With the implementation of decentralization, megaregions
are the preferred answer by the global Elite for controlling citizens of
former sovereign nations.
Eco-fascists are calling for debates about what
to do with coastal population after disasters like Katrina and Sandy. In
2011, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
admits that studying hurricanes
is a complicated science and they have not been able to definitively prove
that humans are effecting tropical storm patterns.
However, the IPCC warned
that tropical storms will continue to intensify as the temperature of the
planet continues to warm.
Mainstream propaganda
claims that coastal populations should abandon those cities and
retreat inland. However, as unlikely as this solution is, the answer would
be to convert these coastal cities into megaregions where CO2 emissions
could be controlled under Agenda 21 protocols.
Acclimating humans to a social-ecological
system of co-evolving with natural systems would
eliminate the possibility of human destruction to biodiversity.
In fact,
they that our impact is a,
shock [to] a system [that cannot] absorb before
it transforms into something fundamentally different? That, in a nutshell,
is the essence of resilience.
Setting aside,
green spaces, both natural and
man-made, can buffer a city against change and megacities can recondition
future generations to become core contributors for future
sustainability.
The C40
Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) are an interconnected group of
megacities that promise to adhere to UN mandates on climate change.
In 2007, mayors from 40 major cities across the
world collaboratively decided to alter the landscape of their cities to
reflect globalists answers to global warming by implementing Agenda 21
incrementally.
Back in July, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg
announced the construction of 275 to 300 square foot
micro-apartments in Kips Bay in a beta-test to coerce New Yorkers into
living in tight-knit, purposefully dense areas to alter the psychological
landscape toward conversation globalist style.
In San Francisco single individuals are
rent their very own 1st generation
Agenda 21 two hundred and twenty-two
square foot apartment (if the closet and bathroom are factored into the
allocated living space).
The intention of these shoe box homes are to
house marginalize the general public and train them to accept less living
space in the name of affordability.
In Boston, one developer exclaims that renters
only need 450 square feet to live in and anything else is a waste of space.
In the Seaport District Mayor Thomas M. Menino says that young professionals
will want to live in these mini-apartments because of their exceptional
waterfront views.
Meninos $100 million endeavor
called the Boston Wharf Tower is a,
project will help turn this
neighborhood into a vibrant, 24-hour mixed-use community.
In these units there is barely room for
furniture, so designers made sure that there would be a pull-out couch and a
comparatively small monthly rental to justify asking the Bostonian public to
live in a personal Agenda 21 prison.
The C40 has expanded to 58 cities that use
UN
Agenda 21 regulations to monitor global populations, decrease CO2 emissions
and affect the global gross domestic product (GDP). Being major cities, they
have a tremendous influence over setting the standard for a low carbon
economy.
In a
case study produced by C40, the outline for 4,734 procedures currently
in action are explained which gives credence to local leaders becoming a
collective for the alarmists and eco-fascists.
C40 seeks to control cities because they,
consume over two-thirds of the worlds energy and account for more than 70%
of global CO2 emissions.
Being influential, the
example that can be set in urbanized areas will eventually trickle into
rural areas; with the eventuality of returning those areas to their natural
state and moving massive populations into megaregions.
Christopher Kennedy, author of The Evolution of
Great World Cities and professor at the University of Toronto
states that redefining the infrastructure of megacities must include new
rules, codes and social norms to recondition citizens into the new structure
of how cities will be governed in the future.
A global corporate dominance
will purvey the landscape as well as mandating new building technologies
that maximize urban space.
