As the financial oligarchs of the West push
forward in their year-long
global geopolitical reordering of North Africa,
the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, the globe is being divided into
two primary camps:
-
those behind the West, or the
"Washington-London consensus"
-
those behind what might be described as
a combination of the BRICS nations and the Shanghai Cooperative
Organization (SCO)
Ideally, what the countervailing forces against
the West claim to represent is a multipolar world order built upon mutual
benefit and solidarity, preserving the traditional concept of the
nation-state rather than one of neo-imperial domination and
supranational-consolidation under a one-world financier oligarchy.
However, the people of the world in general must recognize corruption,
monopolies, and imperialism in all of its forms, regardless of what flag is
being flown and be ever vigilant against these dangers.
While geopolitical analysts today may consider
BRICS and the SCO as essential for maintaining a multipolar balance of power
against the West, the risk of a strategy of tension creating increasingly
centralized supranational blocs "facing off against each other" may leave
whomever prevails with the capacity to carry out global despotism on an even
grander scale.

assured destruction - the ultimate balance of power -
that prevented catastrophic war from breaking out
between East and West.
Balancing power, offering deterrence against aggression
and exploitation has been the study of tacticians for
thousands of years and is a subject the global elite are
well versed in.
The
masses must also familiarize themselves with such
concepts and formulate their own means of balancing
power locally and nationally to keep in check powers
both foreign and domestic that seek domination through
exploiting economic, social, and tactical disparity.

Worldwide, people must begin
identifying
national and international special interests, and rejecting them all
entirely.
They must begin devising local alternatives by
leveraging technology and collaboration where possible, and realizing that
nationalism, localism, and borders in general represent indispensable
protective bulkheads with which to stop the spread of abuse of power,
exploitation, military aggression, corruption of all kinds, and both social
and financial dysfunction.
Like a fleet of compartmentalized ships, a world of nation-states is able to
cooperate, communicate, and collaborate efficiently, "traveling together"
when desired, but maintains the option of changing course to avoid
collisions, and "sealing off" sections internally to prevent a single hole
from compromising an entire vessel.
Global cooperation, communication, and
collaboration does not require "globalization"
and foolish interdependencies that leave all nations vulnerable and at risk
when any single point falters or if globalization's centralized institutions
become corrupted.
We need not pick between "isolationism" and
"globalization," we can meet in the middle and enjoy the benefits of both,
afforded to us by the modern nation-state and traditional diplomacy, while
hedging against the risks each option represents individually.
An Informed, Active, &
Vigilant Citizenry Is Needed
The world must perform a careful balancing act to ensure Western financier
oligarchy is kept in check, or ideally rolled back, while ensuring in our
haste or zeal we do not create its replacement in the process.
An international, multipolar balance of power
requires that each nation-state acquires, maintains, and continuously
expands a certain degree of independence in terms of economics and defense.
Within a nation and its provinces, to achieve such balance, a certain degree
of independence amongst individuals and their communities is required.
To enhance individual and local independence, we
can do everything from being responsible firearms owners, growing a garden,
patronizing local businesses and industry, learning a trade, and simply
learning how to organize and work with our neighbors to solve our own
problems.
While we are faced with immense, overwhelming global problems stemming from
monolithic powers - these powers are fed by each and every one of us
individually when we pay into multinational corporations and their contrived
institutions, laws, and regulations.
If our collective actions can create and
compound these problems,
surely they can solve them.
It is disparity that is used to sell globalization:
disparity in climate, in the resources
present within one's borders, of the quality and education of one's work
force, and the disparity between nations in their ability to defend
themselves.
These are all factors that govern the form
globalization takes, including all of its supposed benefits and the serial
exploitation it leaves behind.
We are told that globalization's interdependent
relationships governed by centralized international institutions are the
keys to solving these disparities. This is not true.
Policy never has and never will solve our problems as a species. Instead, it
is through technological research and development, innovation and invention,
investment in defense, infrastructure, and education that these disparities
can truly be reduced or all together eliminated, creating stronger
communities and in-turn a stronger nation-state while deterring aggression
and exploitation at our borders.
Trade and collaboration with one's neighbors
becomes a supplement to a strong independent nation, not a necessity and
certainly not a liability in a time of crisis.
We must ask our elected representatives why these obvious measures are not
being taken to address these disparities.
-
Why are we exploiting poorly educated
workforces for cheap labor instead of leveraging technology and
education to create the same products domestically, better and
cheaper?
-
Why are we importing certain goods
instead of devising ways to produce them locally?
-
Why are we struggling for fuel abroad
instead of making a serious effort to develop alternatives at home?
The questions could go on ad infinitum and
illustrate just how globalization has been sold as a ready-made solution to
artificially created and/or perpetuated problems.
It also illustrates the necessity for regular
people to boycott the corporations and institutions perpetuating such flawed
policy, and devise solutions themselves.

(below video) seeks
to provide modern manufacturing technology to people
around the world to solve local problems with local,
technological solutions.
Fab
Labs and "maker spaces" are turning up in communities
around the world, literally putting the means of
production into the masses' hands, and are a good place
to start for people interested in organizing locally,
sharing knowledge, and collaborating on projects that
leverage technology to the benefit of everyone.
Balancing power need not involve weapons of mass
destruction or violent uprisings - an informed,
educated, technically competent self-sufficient
population starves the forces of parasitic elitism out
of existence.
It is essential to examine the state of modern
technology today, from communication and education, to manufacturing
technology, to see what can be leveraged by people on a local level so that
communities can not only devise their own programs to address their
problems, but so that they can begin implementing solutions on their as
well.
As communities grow stronger, their ability to
influence pragmatic positive change provincially and nationally will
increase and a balance of power may be struck.
Demanding change from a position of weakness, without even the means of
sustaining one's existence without the very corporations, institutions, and
governments change is being demanded from, is strategically untenable.
Individuals and local communities must build-up their capacity in terms of
education, economics, politics, and their ability to provide for themselves
adequate order and security (through effective Constitutional sheriffs for
instance).
Only then will the people possess a sufficient
deterrence against exploitation, as well as possess the leverage needed to
make demands or simply achieve on their own what they desire.
Conclusion
There is already the European Union and the African Union.
There exists an informal
North
American Union and a transatlantic partnership. The excuse of a
rising China has spurred Southeast Asia into forming the ill-advised ASEAN
bloc, complete with European Union-style institutions, ready to fail just as
spectacularly both politically and economically.
Even the Shanghai Cooperation Organization comes
with it the potential of consolidating the "other side" of the world into a
growing supranational bloc.
People must inform themselves of the differences between international
cooperation, and recklessly lashing their ships together while gutting the
watertight compartments within their own hulls. Generally, such
self-defeating exercises are coordinated by piratical elements who find such
consolidation and the removal of obstructions convenient for subsequent
plundering - as the banks in America and Europe are currently doing to
Western nation-states.
Recent tensions with Russia herald the rise of not individual superpowers
this time, but the rise of "superpower blocs."
We must ensure we do not fall for a strategy of
tension that leaves us all at the mercy of a terribly powerful,
supranationally-consolidated victor, be it East or West. Alliances that pose
as anti-fascism or anti-imperialism must make the appropriate assurances
that a multipolar world order will prevail, strengthening the nation-state
and the individual, not undermining them.
Simultaneously, we as individuals must be resolved to taking our fates into
our own hands,
taking back the responsibilities demanded of a free citizenry
that we have long ago traded in for the convenience offered by monopolies of
all kinds.
It has been our collective negligence that has
led to a world of such disparities - it must be our collective resolve that
rectifies them.
