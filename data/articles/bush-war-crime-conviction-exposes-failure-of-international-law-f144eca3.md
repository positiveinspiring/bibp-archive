A historic ruling handed down by the
Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Tribunal found
former-US President George W. Bush and his associates
guilty of war
crimes including torture.
Using standards provided by the International
Criminal Court (ICC) and based on the precedent set by the Nuremberg trials,
the tribunal succeeded in observing existing international standards in
reaching its verdict before forwarding the results to the ICC and
the United
Nations.

Nile Bowie reports on the conclusion of the Kuala
Lumpur War Crimes Tribunal held in Malaysia earlier this
month, which found former-US President George W. Bush
and his associates guilty of war crimes. Those involved
in the trial are under no illusions that the ICC and UN
will most likely do nothing regarding very real war
crimes, but recognize the importance of the trial in
exposing this fact.
However, for those involved, they are under no
illusions that the ICC or the UN will take actions against the accused.
As
noted by Professor Michel Chossudovsky of the Centre for Research on
Globalization, the very institutions charged with maintaining international
rule of law, have been in fact instrumental in facilitating its violation by
the hands of powerful Western nations.
Professor Chossudovsky stated,
"the
fact that if war criminals are not prosecuted by the domestic and
international legal system, that means that the legal apparatus, the
judicial system is turned upside down and is serving the interests of the
war criminals who actually call the shots."
Indeed, it is clear, as in Libya, genocidal terrorist organizations, stated
as such on both US and British terror organization lists, were empowered by
this very upturning of "international law," where baseless claims of "human
rights" violations were not only used to accuse and undermine leaders of
sovereign nation-states, but used to justify acts of war in deposing
targeted governments.
In Libya, not only were militants led by terrorist
organizations like the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group committing very real
atrocities, but NATO itself did as well. Militants on the ground
purposefully blockaded entire cities, cutting off food, water, electricity,
and medical supplies while NATO flattened the city with daily airstrikes.
In
other words, NATO did demonstratively before the eyes of the world what it
accused the Libyan government of doing used to justify its military
intervention in the first place.
We see a similar scenario unfolding in Syria, however, now,
the US has
already admitted that despite a UN brokered ceasefire, it is arranging the
arming of militants now exposed as having direct ties to Al Qaeda and other
extremist organizations, admittedly carrying out a campaign of terror across
Syria, specifically targeting civilian populations. The US has also
admitted, in the midst of an alleged UN ceasefire, that it is attempting to
trigger a violent Kurdish uprising.
As Professor Chossudovsky has
illustrated, "international law" has clearly been turned upside down to the
benefit of real, demonstrative war criminals.
So then, the tribunal held in Malaysia successfully exposed "international
law" as dysfunctional and in fact, counter productive - enabling, not
deterring gross acts of global injustice, wars of aggression, and the
systematic abuse of human rights and freedom in nation after nation by an
expanding international criminal cartel centered on Wall Street and London.
And while this is useful in and of itself, the tribunal and those involved,
by extending convictions beyond figure heads like George Bush and Richard
Cheney to include advisers and policy makers of corporate-funded
think-tanks, a wider network of criminality has been exposed as well.
The ICC and UN will predictably do nothing regarding this ruling.
This
should not even be expected. Instead, the tribunal should be understood in
the context as not only a form of protest, but the boycotting of a corrupt
system and the creation of a viable, more inclusive alternative. Legal
proceedings are designed to examine evidence and convict guilty parties,
then determining appropriate and practical punitive measures.
Those involved in the crimes described by the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes
Tribunal are but a small proportion of a much larger international criminal
cartel representing the largest corporate-financier powers on earth.
While
imprisonment may be the most ideal punishment to level against those
convicted in Malaysia, it is not currently practical.
Instead,
identifying the individuals, corporations, and institutions
directly responsible and in fact harboring many of those convicted, and
imposing "sanctions" on them, is not only practical, but will help erode the
unwarranted base of power from which these global elite operate with
absolute impunity.
Eventually, if the silent majority finds the resolve to
act on the tribunal's ruling,
and impose "sanctions" on the special
interests driving these criminal acts, and should this atmosphere of
impunity be eroded, imprisoning international war criminals may eventually
become a practical reality.
