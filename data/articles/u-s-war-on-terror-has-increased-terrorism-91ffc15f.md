Charts Show that U.S. Policy Has Increased Terror Attacks
The National Consortium for the Study of
Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) Global Terrorism Database -
part of a joint government-university program on terrorism - is hosted at
the University of Maryland.
START is the most comprehensive open source
terrorism database, which can be viewed by journalists and civilians lacking
national security clearance.
A quick review of charts from the START database
show that terrorism has increased in the last 9 years since the U.S. started
its "war on terror".
This chart shows the number of terror attacks
conducted in,
Iraq:
Afghanistan:
The
Middle East:
Asia:
Africa:
Indeed,
global terrorism had been falling from 1992 until 2004
but has been
skyrocketing since 2004:
Our Wars In the Middle East Have Created More Terrorists
Security experts - including both conservatives
and liberals - agree that waging war in the Middle East weakens
national security and increases terrorism.
See
this,
this,
this,
this,
this,
this,
this and
this. Ooops...
Killing innocent civilians is one of the main
things which increases terrorism.
As one of the top counter-terrorism experts (the
former number 2 counter-terrorism expert at the State Department)
told me, starting wars against states which do not pose an imminent
threat to Americas national security increases the threat of terrorism
because:
One of the principal causes of terrorism is
injuries to people and families.
The Iraq war
wasnt even fought to combat terrorism. And
Al Qaeda wasnt even in Iraq until
the U.S. invaded that country.
And top CIA officers say that
drone strikes increase terrorism (and
see this).
Furthermore, James K. Feldman - former professor
of decision analysis and economics at the Air Force Institute of Technology
and the School of Advanced Airpower Studies - and other experts say that
foreign occupation is the main cause of terrorism.
University of Chicago professor Robert A. Pape -
who specializes in international security affairs -
points out:
Extensive research into the causes of
suicide terrorism proves Islam isnt to blame - the root of the problem
is foreign military occupations.
***
Each month, there are more suicide
terrorists trying to kill Americans and their allies in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and other Muslim countries than in all the years before 2001
combined.
***
New
research provides strong evidence that suicide terrorism such as that of
9/11 is particularly sensitive to foreign military occupation, and not
Islamic fundamentalism or any ideology independent of this crucial
circumstance. Although this pattern began
to emerge in the 1980s and 1990s, a wealth of new data presents a
powerful picture.
More
than 95 percent of all suicide attacks are in response to foreign
occupation, according to
extensive research [co-authored by James K. Feldman - former
professor of decision analysis and economics at the
Air Force Institute of Technology and
the School of Advanced Airpower Studies] that we conducted at
the University of Chicagos Project on Security and Terrorism, where we
examined every one of the over 2,200 suicide attacks across the world
from 1980 to the present day.
As the United States has occupied
Afghanistan and Iraq, which have a combined population of about 60
million, total suicide attacks worldwide have risen dramatically - from
about 300 from 1980 to 2003, to 1,800 from 2004 to 2009. Further, over
90 percent of suicide attacks worldwide are now anti-American.
The vast majority of suicide terrorists hail
from the local region threatened by foreign troops, which is why 90
percent of suicide attackers in Afghanistan are Afghans.
Israelis have their own narrative about
terrorism, which holds that Arab fanatics seek to destroy the Jewish
state because of what it is, not what it does. But since Israel withdrew
its army from Lebanon in May 2000, there has not been a single Lebanese
suicide attack.
Similarly, since Israel withdrew from Gaza
and large parts of the West Bank, Palestinian suicide attacks are down
over 90 percent.
***
The first step is recognizing that
occupations in the Muslim
world dont make Americans any safer -
in fact, they are at the heart of the problem.
Our Program of Torture Created Terrorists
In addition, torture
creates new terrorists:
"Torture puts our troops in danger, torture makes
our troops less safe, torture creates terrorists. Its used so
widely as a propaganda tool now in Afghanistan. All too often,
detainees have pamphlets on them, depicting what happened at
Guantanamo."
"The administrations policies
concerning [torture] and the resulting controversies
strengthened the hand of our enemies."
-
And the
reporter who broke Iran-Contra and other stories
says that torture actually helped Al Qaeda, by giving false
leads to the U.S. which diverted its military, intelligence and
economic resources into wild goose chases
So the widespread program of torture under the
Bush administration didnt help.
Nice Job
Creating More Terrorists, You Morons
Additionally - in the name of fighting our
enemies - the U.S. has directly been supporting Al Qaeda and other terrorist
groups for the last decade.
See
this,
this,
this,
this and
this.
Why Have We
Given Up Our Rights If the Government Cant Keep Us Safe?
We have
given up the fundamental rights which make
us American.
The government
insisted that - if we gave up our liberties - it would keep us safe.It has failed to do so, and has instead
squandered our national treasure, our resources and our troops on efforts
which have only increased the risk of terrorism.
Wasted Defense Spending
A
large amount of the
homeland security spending has been
wasted
producing
"a bunch of crap".
For example, spending money on
zombie apocalypse training or other
silly programs is
a
bad investment which led to a
false sense of security. Spending defense money on a workshop called
"Did Jesus die for Klingons too?"
and DOD-run microbreweries is probably
not helping stop terrorist attacks.
Moreover,
using homeland security resources to
spy on average Americans or crack down on
peaceful protesters or government critics distracts from getting the actual bad guys.
At the same time, both the Bush and Obama
administrations have
slashed funding for programs which would actually help prevent terror
attacks.
Heck of a job, guys
The Real Agenda
Regime change was planned throughout the Middle
East and North Africa were
planned
20 years ago
long before 9/11.
As just one example,
-
U.S. Secretary of Defense
Chuck Hagel
-
4-Star General (and CENTCOM commander with responsibility for
Iraq) John Abizaid
-
key war architect John Bolton, a high-level National
Security Council officer
-
President George W. Bush
-
Bush speech writer David Frum
-
Senator John McCain
-
Fed boss Alan Greenspan
-
Sarah Palin,
...all
say that
the Iraq war was about oil.
Documents from Britain
show the same thing.
Much of the war on terror is really a
fight for natural gas. Or to force the last few hold-outs into
dollars and private central banking.
Senior government officials have described
terrorist attacks as a "small
price to pay for being a superpower". And while politicians talk about
ending the war on terror, endless war is a
feature - not a bug - of our foreign policy.
Whatever the real agenda one thing is clear
In the same way that
NSA spying isnt about preventing terrorism (proof
here,
here,
here and
here), the war on terror is cover for other shenanigans.
