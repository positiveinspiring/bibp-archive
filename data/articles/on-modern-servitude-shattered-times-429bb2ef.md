# On Modern Servitude - Shattered Times

Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
William Shakespear
King Lear, Act IV, scene 1
Modern servitude is voluntary, endorsed by those slaves who crawl on the
surface of the Earth. They buy the merchandises that enslave them every day
more. Slaves run after alienating jobs that are gently given to them if they
prove to be tamed enough.
They choose the masters they will obey. For this
absurd tragedy to happen, it has been necessary to dispossess slaves from
the awareness of their own exploitation and their alienation. Here is the
bizarre modernity of our time. Contrary to slaves from antiquity, servants
from the Middle Ages or the working-class from the first industrial
revolutions, today we are contemplating people that are totally enslaved.
The difference is that they are unaware of their enslavement and those who
are aware, choose to ignore it. They ignore rebellion which should be the
only genuine reaction of the exploited ones. Slaves accept without question
the pitiful life that was planned for them.
Renouncing and resignation are
the sources of their misfortune.
