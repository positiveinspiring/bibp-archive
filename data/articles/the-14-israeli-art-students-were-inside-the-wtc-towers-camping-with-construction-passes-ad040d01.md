The 14 Art Students, it has now been confirmed, were in the World Trade Center Towers with Construction Passes, Connection to Mossad Spy Ring
Part I
October 12, 2009
I was contacted by an individual who led me to this information about the art students living in WTC Tower 1 before 9/11.
In fact, in May of 2000, they were living on the 91st floor where they were doing construction and sleeping in tents. They did have construction passes. I do believe that ACE Elevator and Securicom, as well as Kroll Associates should be focused on, however, this is important information that has never been confirmed, until now. These art students were apart of the art group, gelitin, and were pulling off a large stunt in the name of art, at least that is the official story. Gelatin is notorious for encouraging and participating in various stunts and elaborate adventures to push art into the pop culture by performing publicity stunts.
The project these art students from Austria and Germany were apart of was called, "The B-Thing."
I am in the process of uploading all of the photos and information to make available to everyone online, so be looking for that soon. In the meantime, I broke the story on Kevin Barret's radio show, "Truth Jihad" which airs every Saturday on American Freedom Radio. The audio from that interview is in the Youtube clip at the top of this post, but if you want to download it, it is at the following link: http://radiodujour.wordpress.com/2009/10/10/art-students-camping-on-the-90th-floor/ The art students released a book about their art event out of Austria and the book is extremely hard to come by. IN fact, it is limited release and most copies are sold, I had to search very hard to find a copy but I found one. Here is a link to one of the stores that used to sell it: http://www.artbook.com/3883755079.html The New York times did an article on the Gelatin crew made up of up to 14 Austrian and German students. You can view the original New York Times article here: http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/18/nyregion/balcony-scene-unseen-atop-world-episode-trade-center-assumes-mythic-qualities.html
Again, stay tuned for more on this coming in the near future and also sign up on my newsletter here at CoreOfCorruption.com to receive the update on the sequel in the series titled, "Core of Corruption - Echoes of Treason" which is soon to be released (below video):
Background
Don't read this until you have viewed the above. Here is the older information regarding this Israeli agents who laughed and danced and high-fived when the towers collapsed - for those who still think Arab terrorists with box-cutters did 9-11 - note too the articles of mine (further down) including the Israelis infiltrated at Dulles and Reagan airports on 9-11, each with illegal top security clearances - whom Attorney General Ashcroft quietly sent back home to Israel after holding them, without Guantanamo-style interrogation, for 3 months.
They later were on Israeli radio and mentioned, in Hebrew, having been there to record the event. The Israeli "art student" story, which first surfaced in 2001 in news reports, has yet to be explained by U.S. authorities.
A memorandum sent to the 9/11 Commission, and Senate and House intelligence committees in September 2004, suggests that young Israelis who canvassed dozens of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) offices in 2000 and 2001 trying to sell paintings to federal workers, may have been spying not only on the DEA, but also on Arab extremists in the United States - including the Sept. 11 hijackers who were living in Florida and New Jersey. Many reports describe incidents of government employees spotting individuals in office hallways or elevators carrying large art portfolio cases. The art sellers would typically make a pitch to sell paintings, but if they were told that soliciting in government offices was prohibited, some replied that the art wasn't actually for sale but was promoting a future art show, the DEA report said. During the first five months of 2001, according to Shea's memorandum, the "Israeli DEA Groups" visited a total of 57 DEA locations - 28 offices and 29 private residences Other individuals that Shea calls the "Israeli New Jersey Group" were based in Bergen and Hudson counties, in New Jersey, according to the well-annotated memorandum that also cites the 9/11 Commission report, the 2002 congressional intelligence committees' joint inquiry into the terrorist attacks, newspaper and magazine reports, Fox News telecasts, 9/11 hijacker timelines, FBI suspect lists, and an East Rutherford (New Jersey) Police Department report. Dozens of the more than 100 Israelis were stopped and questioned by DEA agents, and other federal government authorities.
The individuals were vague about why they were in the U.S. or what their purpose was for being here. Dozens were arrested for visa violations and deported, according to the memorandum. Many in the groups had served in the military, which is compulsory for Israeli citizens, and group leaders had been in intelligence and electronic communications units.
With such expertise, it strikes many as odd that the Israelis would be hawking inexpensive artwork. In the report, the DEA concluded that the agency was being spied on by the Israelis. In 2001, a Fox News report by Carl Cameron laid out the Israeli spy scenario, however, the story was short-lived, and Shea was told by a representative at the news organization that there was outside pressure to kill the story.
Wayne Madsen Online Journal Friday, July 17, 2009 The way the corporate media would have it believed is that Israeli "art students" who aggressively sell cheap art door-to-door, usually at federal office buildings and the houses of government employees, are merely traveling abroad after their military service in Israel to "see the world." In fact, these "art students" are classic intelligence operatives who have appeared before and after major terrorist events and covert operations conducted by the Mossad. WMR has learned that an Israeli art student cased the offices of an investigator of the suspicious February 26, 2004, death of Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski. Trajkovski's Beechcraft King Air 200 crashed near Stolac, Croatia, in southern Bosnia while en route to an investors' conference in Mostar. After the crash, U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia Lawrence Butler quickly met with Nikolai Gruevski, the minister of finance in the VMRO-DPMNE government. Gruevski was an ardent supporter of denationalization, a globalist, and supporter of NATO membership for Macedonia. Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, although a Social Democrat, was also seen as close to the globalists. Although Trajkovski, a Methodist minister, was also a member of the VMRO-DPMNE party he was viewed as less accommodating to international demands for privatization of state enterprises in Macedonia. After Trajkovski and his party were killed in the plane crash, Macedonian and Bosnian authorities complained that NATO's investigation of the plane crash was secretive and the two countries' aviation authorities were kept in the dark. Many Macedonian officials were opposed to allowing the United States to investigate the crash and there was confusion about who had access to the two "black boxes" on Trajkovski's plane. NATO troops stationed in Bosnia were the first to arrive at the crash scene. HUNDREDS OF MOSSAD AGENTS CAUGHT RUNNING WILD IN AMERICA by Warren Royal We spoke earlier about the five celebrating Israeli "movers", (Mossad agents), who were arrested and placed in solitary confinement for weeks after they were spotted in a white van suspected of attempting to blow up the George Washington Bridge. We also reviewed how the Israeli owner of Urban Moving Systems - Dominick Suter - then suddenly abandoned his "moving company" and fled for Israel on 9-14. But there were still more Israeli "movers" and other Israelis whose actions raise serious suspicions. Even more suspicious is how they are always quietly released and deported. In October of 2001, three more Israeli "movers" were stopped in Plymouth, PA because of their suspicious behavior. These "movers" were seen dumping furniture near a restaurant dumpster! When the restaurant manager approached the driver, a "Middle Eastern" man later identified as Moshe Elmakias fled the scene. The manager made note of the truck's sign which read "Moving Systems Incorporated" and called the police. When the police spotted the truck, two other Israelis - Ayelet Reisler and Ron Katar began acting suspiciously. The Plymouth police searched the truck and found a video. The Israelis were taken into custody and the video tape was played at the police station. The video revealed footage of Chicago with zoomed in shots of the Sears Tower. The police quickly alerted the FBI and it was also discovered that the Israelis had falsified travel logs and phony paperwork on them. (1) They were also unable to provide a name and telephone number for the customer that they claimed to have been working for. These Israelis were up to some sort of dirty business, and you can be sure it had nothing to do with moving furniture. These Israeli spies may have had a dark sense of humor. The name of their "moving company" actually contained the word MOSSAD embedded inside. Moving Systems Incorporated. MOving SyStems IncorporAteD...MOSSAD On October 10, 2001, CNN made a brief mention of a foiled terrorist bomb plot in the Mexican Parliament building. They promised to bring any further developments of this story to their viewers, but the incident was never heard of again in America. But the story appeared in bold headlines on the front page of the major Mexican newspapers (2) and was also posted on the official website of the Mexican Justice Department. (3) Two terror suspects were apprehended in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies. Caught red-handed, they had in their possession a high powered gun, nine hand grenades, and C-4 plastic explosives (great stuff for demolishing buildings!) Within days, this blockbuster story not only disappeared from the Mexican press, but the Israelis were quietly released and deported! The two terrorists were Salvador Gerson Sunke and Sar ben Zui. Can you guess what their ethnicity was? Sunke was a Mexican jew and Zui was a colonel with the Israeli special forces (MOSSAD). (4) The story in El Diario de Mexico went on to reveal that the Zionist terrorists had fake Pakistani passports on them. Can you say "false flag operation?" The probable motive of this particular botched terrorist operation was to involve oil rich Mexico in the "War on Terrorism". (The War on Israel's enemies would be a more accurate description). Mexico is no military power, but the psychological trauma of an "Arab" attack on Mexico would surely have induced Mexico to provide unlimited cheap oil to her American "protector". With cheap oil flowing to America at low prices from Mexico, the US could better afford to break off relations with the oil rich Arab states in general and Saudi Arabia in particular. That's why the planners chose 15 Saudi identities to steal for the 9-11 operation. Many Mexicans expressed shock at the release of the two Israelis. But when you learn that Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Relations is a Zionist named Jorge Gutman, it's not surprising! The Zionist tentacles reach even into Mexico! La Voz de Aztlan (Mexican-American news service), in it's excellent investigative report revealed: "La Voz de Aztlan has learned that the Israeli Embassy used heavy handed measures to have the two Israelis released. Very high level emergency meetings took place between Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Jorge Gutman, General Macedo de la Concha and a top Ariel Sharon envoy who flew to Mexico City specially for that purpose. Elías Luf of the Israeli Embassy worked night and day and their official spokeswoman Hila Engelhart went into high gear after many hours of complete silence. What went on during those high level meetings no one knows, but many in Mexico are in disbelief at their release." (5) In November of 2001, 6 more suspicious Israelis were detained in an unspecified mid-eastern state. They had in their possession box cutters, oil pipeline plans, and nuclear power plant plans. (6) The local police called in the Feds and Immigration officials took over the scene and released the men without calling the FBI. The Jerusalem Post, the Miami Herald, (7) and the Times of London (8) all carried this amazing story and all revealed how furious FBI officials were that these terror suspects with nuclear power plant plans were allowed to go free. Of course, the corruption riddled FBI would only have caved into Zionist pressure from the Justice Department's Criminal Division boss, Michael Chertoff, and also from the ADL's "partner", FBI boss Robert Mueller - who would no doubt have found a way to eventually release those Israeli terror suspects too. In December, 2001, the Los Angeles Times published the story of how two jewish terrorists were arrested by the FBI for plotting to blow up the office of US Congressman of Arab descent - Darrell Issa (R- CA), and a California mosque. (9) Irv Rubin and Earl Kruger of the Jewish Defense League (JDL) were charged with conspiracy to destroy a building by means of explosives. This story got brief national coverage but quickly disappeared too. These Zionists sure love blowing up buildings and killing innocent people don't they? In May of 2002, yet another moving van was pulled over in Oak Harbor, Washington near the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. Fox News reported that the van was pulled over for speeding shortly after midnight. The passengers told the police they were delivering furniture, but because it was so late at night, the police weren't buying the story. A bomb sniffing dog was brought in and the dog detected the presence of TNT and RDX plastic explosives in the truck (great stuff for demolishing buildings!) Both Fox News (10) and the Ha'aretz newspaper of Israel (11) reported that the two "movers" were Israelis. In December, 2002, Ariel Sharon made the amazing claim that Al-Qaeda agents were operating inside of Israel. But when Palestinian authorities apprehended the suspects, they turned out to be Palestinian traitors impersonating Al-qaeda agents for the MOSSAD! From the Sydney Morning Herald of Australia: "Palestinian security forces have arrested a group of Palestinians for collaborating with Israel and posing as operatives of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda terrorist network, a senior official said yesterday. ..The arrests come two days after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon charged al-Qaeda militants were operating in Gaza and in Lebanon. It was considered a surprise because the Gaza Strip is virtually sealed off by Israeli troops. The hard-line Israeli leader also charged other members of the terror group were cooperating with Lebanon's Shi'ite militia Hizbollah" (12) You know, if Sharon wasn't so dangerous, I'd almost be amused by his bullshit! According to FOX news, throughout late 2000 and 2001, a total of 200 Israeli spies were arrested. (13) It was the largest spy ring to ever be uncovered in the history of the United States. The Washington Post also reported that some of these Israelis were arrested in connection with the 9-11 investigation. (14) US. Carl Cameron of FOX News Channel did a excellent four part, nationally televised, series of investigations into this blockbuster scandal. But FOX pulled the investigative series after Zionist groups complained to FOX executives. FOX even went so far as to remove the written transcripts of the series from its website! In it's place was posted a chilling, Orwellian message which reads: "This story no longer exists." (15) Fortunately for the sake of history, the FOX transcripts were copied onto to many other websites and all four parts are available for your review. (see footnotes.) The FOX series and other mainstream news media sources revealed that many of these Israelis were army veterans with electronics and explosives expertise. Many of them failed lie detector tests. FBI agents told FOX that some of their past investigations were compromised because suspects had been tipped off by Israeli wiretapping specialists. It was discovered that Israeli companies such as Comverse and Amdocs have the capability to tap American telephones (great for blackmailing all those wife-cheating politicians!) FBI agents also told FOX they believed the Israelis had advance knowledge of the 9-11 attacks. (which certainly would explain why no Israelis died in the WTC) Still another US official informed FOX that some of the detained Israelis actually had links to 9-11, but he refused to describe the nature of those links. The FBI official told FOX's Carl Cameron: "Evidence linking these Israelis to 9-11 is classified. I cannot tell you about the evidence that has been gathered. It is classified information." (16) Then there was that small army of Israeli "art students" who were arrested for trying to sneak into secured US Federal buildings and staking out 36 Department of Defense sites. Some of these suspicious "art students" even showed up at the homes of Federal employees. (17) Ron Hatchett, a Department of Defense analyst, told Channel 11, KHOU news in Houston that he believed that the "art students" were gathering intelligence for future attacks. Here's an excerpt from the October 1, 2001 KHOU investigative report by Anna Werner: "Could federal buildings in Houston and other cities be under surveillance by foreign groups? That's what some experts are asking after federal law enforcement and security officials - nationally and in Houston - described for the 11 News Defenders a curious pattern of behavior by a group of people claiming to be Israeli art students." "Hatchett says they could be doing what he would be doing if he were a terrorist, sizing up the situation: "We need to know what are the entrances to this particular building. We need to know what are the surveillance cameras that are operating. We need to know how many guards are at this operation, when do they take breaks?" Says Hatchett: This is not a bunch of kids selling artwork." "A former Defense Department analyst, Hatchett believes groups may be gathering intelligence for possible future attacks. "Some organization, thinking in terms of a potential retaliation against the U.S. government could be scouting out potential targets and . looking for targets that would be vulnerable." And a source tells the Defenders of another federal memo, stating that besides Houston and Dallas, the same thing has happened at sites in New York, Florida, and six other states, and even more worrisome, at 36 sensitive Department of Defense sites. "One defense site you can explain," says Hatchett, "well that was just a serendipitous,...Thirty-six? That's a pattern." (18) A Federal memo stated that these "art students" may have had ties to an "Islamic terror group". More likely, they were the "Islamic terror group"! Remember the bombing of the King David Hotel in 1946, and how the "Arab terrorists" were actually Irgun terrorists? Remember the Zionist terrorists caught in Mexico with Arab passports? Remember the official motto of the Mossad - By Way of Deception Thou Shalt Do War. Are you getting the picture? Can you say "false flag operations"? In a follow up report a few days later, KHOU Channel 11 revealed that Dallas was also targetted: "11 News reported how people claiming to be "Israeli art students" might be trying to sneak into federal buildings and defense sites, and even doing surveillance. And at least one expert said he thought it could all be preparation for an attack. Well, now federal sources say they are not ruling out that all of this could be connected with the hijackings on September 11, because of events in another Texas city. In Dallas, the so-called students hit early this year at the city's FBI building, the Drug Enforcement Administration and at the Earle Cabell Federal building, where guards found one student wandering the halls with a floor plan of the building. So the Dallas INS went on the alert, finding and arresting 15 people in March. Thirteen claimed to be Israelis and two are professed Colombians. But according to sources, once again their passports were phony. And another federal source says some of those arrested also appeared to have lists of federal employees and their home addresses. All 15 "students" have now been deported. Now, since our first story ran Sunday night, some viewers called who said that they've been visited by people who claim to be Israeli students selling art." (19) Absolutely mind boggling! Why were Israeli explosives experts, posing as "art students" roaming the halls of US Federal buildings? Why were Israeli army vets, armed with explosives and detonators, roaming the halls of the Mexican Congress? Why were Israeli "movers" caught invans with explosives residue ? Might some of these shady characters have once also "roamed the halls" of the World Trade Center prior to 9-11? Why aren't "60 minutes", "Nightline", "20/20", and the rest of the Zionist media aggressively pursuing the story behind the Israeli "art students" and "movers" with 1/1,000th the zeal that they pursued Martha Stewart over allegations of insider trading (who cares?), or 1/10,000th the zeal that they pursued the Catholic Church over an occasional pedophile priest? Funny how we never hear about the documented cases of pedophile rabbis!, or 1/100,000th the zeal that they pursue the Muslim bogeyman on a daily basis? Something smells rotten here! One would think that these intriguing mysteries would have great TV audience appeal, especially in light of the fact that the Oklahoma Federal building was blown up in 1995 by the since executed Timothy McVeigh (dead men tell no tales), and a "John Doe # 2" of "Middle- Eastern appearance", who was never tracked down or pursued despite numerous eye-witness accounts and despite an FBI All Points Bulletin which clearly described him as such. Of America's major networks, only FOX News made a meager attempt to investigate these mysteries, but FOX was quickly silenced by Zionist pressure. This alone is evidence of criminal activity! Before his excellent work was silenced, FOX's Carl Cameron reported this amazing bit of information: "Investigators within the DEA, INS, and FBI have all told FOX News that to pursue or even suggest Israeli spying is considered career suicide."(20) Did you catch that? If a Federal investigator dares to "even suggest" Israeli spying, he has committed "career suicide"! And if a journalist like FOX's Cameron dares to bring this scandal to light, he is told to shut his mouth. If they persist, they may even be called "anti-Semitic" - a label which has served as the kiss of death for many a career. This means that Zionist Mafia can do whatever it wants, whenever it wants, and however it wants - including orchestrating, financing, executing, and covering up the true story of events in the Middle East, the 9-11 massacre, and the ensuing "War on Terrorism" (war on Israel's enemies). Now do you remember the Mossad's "warning" about the 200 "Al-Qaeda terrorists" said to have been preparing major attacks in the US? (21) At the time of this writing, we are one year into the largest investigation in American history, and not one of these 200 "terrorists" has yet to be uncovered. (22) But 200 Israeli spies were uncovered, among them many military members, electronics experts, wiretapping and phone tapping specialists, and explosives experts with the skill to bring down tall buildings. (23) Logic and common sense leads to the conclusion that the "200 Al Qaeda terrorists" were in reality, 200 Zionist terrorists sent to frame the Arabs for terrorist attacks and drag America into a war. On December 11, 2002, Senator Bob Graham (D-FL), a leading member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, appeared as a guest on the PBS Newshour with Gwen Ifill. Graham surprised Ifill by expressing his belief that a foreign government or governments had to have funded and supported the hijackers. Here's part of the exchange: IFILL: "Are you suggesting that you are convinced that there was a state sponsor behind 9/11?" GRAHAM: "I think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted not just in financing - although that was part of it - by a sovereign foreign government and that we have been derelict in our duty to track that down, make the further case, or find the evidence that would indicate that that is not true and we can look for other reasons why the terrorists were able to function so effectively in the United States." IFILL: "Do you think that will ever become public, which countries you're talking about?" Now listen to Graham's bombshell.........: GRAHAM: "It will become public at some point when it's turned over to the archives, but that's 20 or 30 years from now. And, we need to have this information now because it's relevant to the threat that the people of the United States are facing today." (24) Senator Graham is suggesting that US intelligence knows which foreign government helped the terrorists, but the government isn't going to tell us for another 30 years! Given the current state of anti-Muslim war hysteria being promoted by the media and government, common sense dictates that if an Arab government was ever discovered to have sponsored 9-11, we'd be seeing the evidence night and day on the controlled media, and hearing about it non-stop from all the President's warmongers as well as the Israeli-occupied US Congress and Senate. This alone is evidence that no Arab government was involved in 9-11. It can't be an Arab government. Why would any Arab government sponsor "Al-qaeda", an organization dedicated to overthrowing what it sees as corrupt, US-backed Arab governments? What Arab government would have incentive to attack America- its best oil purchasing customer? What Arab government would have the ability to shield itself from US media exposure? What Arab government would be so suicidal, so hell-bent on its own destruction, as to attack a mighty nuclear superpower like the United States? So who, if not an Arab government could be the chief sponsor of 9-11? Again, let's go back to FOX News quoting an FBI official. Pay close attention to the specific language used: "Evidence linking these Israelis to 9-11 is classified. I cannot tell you about the evidence that has been gathered. It is classified information." (25) In order for evidence "linking these Israelis to 9-11" to become classified, the evidence has to have existed in the first place! Furthermore, but it must have been very, very serious stuff indeed. Only the really ugly stuff merits the distinction of being "classified!" It may be possible that the good Senator doesn't know himself which country or countries are involved. Graham may still be under the delusion that it's an Arab government. Or, perhaps he's a disgusted patriot just trying to throw a subtle shot at Israel in his own little way, without actually having to commit "career suicide" as so many other anti-Zionist politicians have in the past. History will reveal the truth one day, just as it did for Pearl Harbor. The trouble is, by that time, no one will care about 9-11 and this phony war "War on Terrorism" anymore. The American attention span does not reach "20-30 years". It's closer to 20-30 minutes, about the length of an average Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, or Tom Brokaw infomercial. If even that! History always repeats itself. But who will teach this history to the American people when the Zionists control the information industry? The Zionist Mafia and their ass-kissing careerist henchmen in media, government, academia, and business have all of the bases covered. The Five Dancing Israelis Arrested On 9-11 On the day of the 9-11 attacks, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked what the attacks would mean for US- Israeli relations. His quick reply was: "It's very good. Well, it's not good, but it will generate immediate sympathy (for Israel)" A Mossad surveillance team made quite a public spectacle of themselves on 9-11. The New York Times reported Thursday that a group of five men had set up video cameras aimed at the Twin Towers prior to the attack on Tuesday, and were seen congratulating one another afterwards. (1) Police received several calls from angry New Jersey residents claiming "middle-eastern" men with a white van were videotaping the disaster with shouts of joy and mockery. (2) "They were like happy, you know They didn't look shocked to me" said a witness. (3) [T]hey were seen by New Jersey residents on Sept. 11 making fun of the World Trade Center ruins and going to extreme lengths to photograph themselves in front of the wreckage. (4) Witnesses saw them jumping for joy in Liberty State Park after the initial impact (5). Later on, other witnesses saw them celebrating on a roof in Weehawken, and still more witnesses later saw them celebrating with high fives in a Jersey City parking lot. (6) "It looked like they're hooked in with this. It looked like they knew what was going to happen when they were at Liberty State Park." (7) One anonymous phone call to the authorities actually led them to close down all of New York's bridges and tunnels. The mystery caller told the 9-1-1 dispatcher that a group of Palestinians were mixing a bomb inside of a white van headed for the Holland Tunnel. Here's the transcript from NBC News: Dispatcher: Jersey City police. Caller: Yes, we have a white van, 2 or 3 guys in there, they look like Palestinians and going around a building. Caller: There's a minivan heading toward the Holland tunnel, I see the guy by Newark Airport mixing some junk and he has those sheikh uniform. Dispatcher: He has what? Caller: He's dressed like an Arab. (8) * Writer's note: Why would this mystery caller specifically say that these "Arabs" were Palestinians? How would he know that? Palestinians usually dress in western style clothes, not "sheikh uniforms" Based on that phone call, police then issued a "Be-on-the-Lookout" alert for a white mini-van heading for the city's bridges and tunnels from New Jersey. White, 2000 Chevrolet van with 'Urban Moving Systems' sign on back seen at Liberty State Park, Jersey City, NJ, at the time of first impact of jetliner into World Trade Center Three individuals with van were seen celebrating after initial impact and subsequent explosion. FBI Newark Field Office requests that, if the van is located, hold for prints and detain individuals. (9) When a van fitting that exact description was stopped just before crossing into New York, the suspicious "middle-easterners" were apprehended. Imagine the surprise of the police officers when these terror suspects turned out to be Israelis! According to ABCs 20/20, when the van belonging to the cheering Israelis was stopped by the police, the driver of the van, Sivan Kurzberg, told the officers: "We are Israelis. We are not your problem. Your problems are our problems. The Palestinians are your problem." (10) Why did he feel Palestinians were a problem for the NYPD? The police and FBI field agents became very suspicious when they found maps of the city with certain places highlighted, box cutters (the same items that the hijackers supposedly used), $4700 cash stuffed in a sock, and foreign passports. Police also told the Bergen Record that bomb sniffing dogs were brought to the van and that they reacted as if they had smelled explosives. (11) The FBI seized and developed their photos, one of which shows Sivan Kurzberg flicking a cigarette lighter in front of the smoldering ruins in an apparently celebratory gesture. (12) The Jerusalem Post later reported that a white van with a bomb was stopped as it approached the George Washington Bridge, but the ethnicity of the suspects was not revealed. Here's what the Jerusalem Post reported on September 12, 2001: American security services overnight stopped a car bomb on the George Washington Bridge. The van, packed with explosives, was stopped on an approach ramp to the bridge. Authorities suspect the terrorists intended to blow up the main crossing between New Jersey and New York, Army Radio reported. (13) "...two suspects are in FBI custody after a truckload of explosives was discovered around the George Washington Bridge... The FBI... says enough explosives were in the truck to do great damage to the George Washington Bridge." WMV video download (545kB) It was reported the van contained tonnes of explosives.(14) What's really intriguing is that ABC's 20/20 (15), the New York Post (16), and the New Jersey Bergen Record (17) all clearly and unambiguously reported that a white van with Israelis was intercepted on a ramp near Route 3, which leads directly to the Lincoln Tunnel. But the Jerusalem Post, Israeli National News (Arutz Sheva) (18), and Yediot America, (19) all reported, just as clearly and unambiguously, that a white van with Israelis was stopped on a ramp leading to the George Washington Bridge, which is several miles north of the Lincoln Tunnel. It appears as if there may actually have been two white vans involved, one stopped on each crossing. This would not only explain the conflicting reports as to the actual location of the arrests, but would also explain how so many credible eye-witnesses all saw celebrating "middle-easterners" in a white van in so many different locations. It also explains why the New York Post and Steve Gordon (lawyer for the 5 Israelis) originally described how three Israelis were arrested but later increased the total to five. Perhaps one van was meant to drop off a bomb while the other was meant to pick up the first set of drivers while re-crossing back into New Jersey? If a van was to be used as a parked time-bomb on the GW Bridge, then certainly the drivers would need to have a "get- away van" to pick them up and escape. And notice how the van (or vans) stayed away from the third major crossing -the Holland Tunnel- which was where the police had originally been directed to by that anti-Palestinian 9-1-1 "mystery caller". A classic misdirection play. From there, the story gets becomes even more suspicious. The Israelis worked for a Weehawken moving company known as Urban Moving Systems. An American employee of Urban Moving Systems told the The Record of New Jersey that a majority of his co-workers were Israelis and they were joking about the attacks. The employee, who declined to give his name said: "I was in tears. These guys were joking and that bothered me." These guys were like, "Now America knows what we go through." (20) A few days after the attacks, Urban Moving System's Israeli owner, Dominick Suter, dropped his business and fled the country for Israel. He was in such a hurry to flee America that some of Urban Moving System's customers were left with their furniture stranded in storage facilities (21). Suter's departure was abrupt, leaving behind coffee cups, sandwiches, cell phones and computers strewn on office tables and thousands of dollars of goods in storage. Suter was later placed on the same FBI suspect list as 9/11 lead hijacker Mohammed Atta and other hijackers and suspected al-Qaeda sympathizers, suggesting that U.S. authorities felt Suter may have known something about the attacks. (22) The Jewish weekly The Forward reported that the FBI finally concluded that at least two of the detained Israelis were agents working for the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that Urban Moving Systems, the ostensible employer of the five Israelis, was a front operation. This was confirmed by two former CIA officers, and they noted that movers' vans are a common intelligence cover. (23) The Israelis were held in custody for 71 days before being quietly released. (24) "There was no question but that [the order to close down the investigation] came from the White House. It was immediately assumed at CIA headquarters that this basically was going to be a cover-up so that the Israelis would not be implicated in any way in 9/11." (25) Several of the detainees discussed their experience in America on an Israeli talk show after their return home. Said one of the men, denying that they were laughing or happy on the morning of Sept. 11, "The fact of the matter is we are coming from a country that experiences terror daily. Our purpose was to document the event." (26) How did they know there would be an event to document on 9/11? It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to connect the dots of the dancing Israeli Mossad agents - here's the most logical scenario: The Israeli "movers" cheered the 9-11 attacks to celebrate the successful accomplishment of the greatest spy operation ever pulled off in history. One of them, or an accomplice, then calls a 9-1-1 police dispatcher to report Palestinian bomb-makers in a white van headed for the Holland Tunnel. Having thus pre-framed the Palestinians with this phone call, the Israeli bombers then head for the George Washington Bridge instead, where they will drop off their time-bomb van and escape with Urban Moving accomplices. But the police react very wisely and proactively by closing off ALL bridges and tunnels instead of just the Holland Tunnel. This move inadvertently foils the Israelis' misdirection play and leads to their own capture and 40 day torture. To cover up this story, the U.S. Justice Department rounds up over 1000 Arabs for minor immigration violations and places them in New York area jails. The Israelis therefore become less conspicuous as the government and media can now claim that the Israelis were just immigration violators caught in the same dragnet as many other Arabs. After several months, FBI and Justice Department "higher-ups" are able to gradually push aside the local FBI agents and free the Israelis quietly. Osama bin Laden was immediately blamed for the 9/11 attacks even though he had no previous record of doing anything on this scale. Immediately after the Flight 11 hit World Trade Center 1 CIA Director George Tenet said, "You know, this has bin Laden's fingerprints all over it." (27) The compliant mainstream media completely ignored the Israeli connection. Immediately following the 9-11 attacks the media was filled with stories linking the attacks to bin Laden. TV talking- heads, "experts", and scribblers of every stripe spoon-fed a gullible American public a steady diet of the most outrageous propaganda imaginable. We were told that the reason bin Laden attacked the USA was because he hates our "freedom" and "democracy". The Muslims were "medieval" and they wanted to destroy us because they envied our wealth, were still bitter about the Crusades, and were offended by Britney Spears shaking her tits and ass all over the place! But bin Laden strongly denied any role in the attacks and suggested that Zionists orchestrated the 9-11 attacks. The BBC published bin Laden's statement of denial in which he said: "I was not involved in the September 11 attacks in the United States nor did I have knowledge of the attacks. There exists a government within a government within the United States. The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity. That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.... The American system is totally in control of the Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States." (28) You never heard that quote on your nightly newscast did you? [A] number of intelligence officials have raised questions about Osama bin Laden's capabilities. "This guy sits in a cave in Afghanistan and he's running this operation?" one C.I.A. official asked. "It's so huge. He couldn't have done it alone." A senior military officer told me that because of the visas and other documentation needed to infiltrate team members into the United States a major foreign intelligence service might also have been involved. (29) Bin Laden is not named as the perpetrator of 9/11 by the FBI: When asked why there is no mention of 9/11 on Bin Ladens Most Wanted web page (30), [Rex Tomb, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI] said, The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Ladens Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11. (31) "So we've never made the case, or argued the case that somehow Osama bin Laden [sic] was directly involved in 9/11. That evidence has never been forthcoming" - Dick Cheney. (32) To date, the only shred of evidence to be uncovered against bin Laden is a barely audible fuzzy amateur video that the Pentagon just happened to find "lying around" in Afghanistan. How very convenient, and how very fake. (33) There is no evidence, be it hard or circumstantial, to link the Al Qaeda "terrorist network" to these acts of terror, but there is a mountain of evidence, both hard and circumstantial, which suggests that Zionists have been very busy framing Arabs for terror plots against America. "I think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted not just in financing - although that was part of it - by a sovereign foreign government... It will become public at some point when it's turned over to the archives, but that's 20 or 30 years from now" - Senator Bob Graham. (34) If the sovereign foreign government mentioned by Senator Graham was an enemy of the United States the "compelling evidence" would not be kept secret for 20+ years. One final point; at 09:40 on 9-11 it was reported that the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for the attacks (35). This claim was immediately denied by the DFLP leader Qais abu Leila who said it had always opposed, "terror attacks on civilian targets, especially outside the occupied territories." (36) Why would a Palestinian organization comprising of less than 500 people (37) make the suicidal move of immediately claiming responsibility for the attacks? Sharon and the other Israeli leaders aspire to fulfill what the goals of the political Zionist movement have been since its origin a century ago: to turn all of historic Palestine into an exclusively Jewish state. A central tenet of the Zionist ideology is expressed in the racist slogan, "A land without people for a people without a land." (38) The implication of Palestinians in the 9/11 attacks would have handed Zionists a golden opportunity to achieve the above because all Palestinians would have been labeled terrorists. "Evidence linking these Israelis to 9/11 is classified. I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered. It's classified information." US official quoted in Carl Cameron's Fox News report on the Israeli spy ring. "By way of deception, thou shalt do war" Motto of the Mossad This story is so complicated and long, I've tried to break it into threads of different colors to make it easier to digest, as well as the main page, the page for the day of September 11, and the abridged timeline.
Wayne Madsen Online Journal
Friday, July 17, 2009 The way the corporate media would have it believed is that Israeli "art students" who aggressively sell cheap art door-to-door, usually at federal office buildings and the houses of government employees, are merely traveling abroad after their military service in Israel to "see the world." In fact, these "art students" are classic intelligence operatives who have appeared before and after major terrorist events and covert operations conducted by the Mossad. WMR has learned that an Israeli art student cased the offices of an investigator of the suspicious February 26, 2004, death of Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski. Trajkovski's Beechcraft King Air 200 crashed near Stolac, Croatia, in southern Bosnia while en route to an investors' conference in Mostar. After the crash, U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia Lawrence Butler quickly met with Nikolai Gruevski, the minister of finance in the VMRO-DPMNE government. Gruevski was an ardent supporter of denationalization, a globalist, and supporter of NATO membership for Macedonia. Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, although a Social Democrat, was also seen as close to the globalists. Although Trajkovski, a Methodist minister, was also a member of the VMRO-DPMNE party he was viewed as less accommodating to international demands for privatization of state enterprises in Macedonia. After Trajkovski and his party were killed in the plane crash, Macedonian and Bosnian authorities complained that NATO's investigation of the plane crash was secretive and the two countries' aviation authorities were kept in the dark. Many Macedonian officials were opposed to allowing the United States to investigate the crash and there was confusion about who had access to the two "black boxes" on Trajkovski's plane.
NATO troops stationed in Bosnia were the first to arrive at the crash scene.
HUNDREDS OF MOSSAD AGENTS CAUGHT RUNNING WILD IN AMERICA by Warren Royal We spoke earlier about the five celebrating Israeli "movers", (Mossad agents), who were arrested and placed in solitary confinement for weeks after they were spotted in a white van suspected of attempting to blow up the George Washington Bridge.
We also reviewed how the Israeli owner of Urban Moving Systems - Dominick Suter - then suddenly abandoned his "moving company" and fled for Israel on 9-14. But there were still more Israeli "movers" and other Israelis whose actions raise serious suspicions. Even more suspicious is how they are always quietly released and deported. In October of 2001, three more Israeli "movers" were stopped in Plymouth, PA because of their suspicious behavior. These "movers" were seen dumping furniture near a restaurant dumpster! When the restaurant manager approached the driver, a "Middle Eastern" man later identified as Moshe Elmakias fled the scene.
The manager made note of the truck's sign which read "Moving Systems Incorporated" and called the police. When the police spotted the truck, two other Israelis - Ayelet Reisler and Ron Katar began acting suspiciously.
The Plymouth police searched the truck and found a video. The Israelis were taken into custody and the video tape was played at the police station. The video revealed footage of Chicago with zoomed in shots of the Sears Tower. The police quickly alerted the FBI and it was also discovered that the Israelis had falsified travel logs and phony paperwork on them. (1)
They were also unable to provide a name and telephone number for the customer that they claimed to have been working for. These Israelis were up to some sort of dirty business, and you can be sure it had nothing to do with moving furniture.
These Israeli spies may have had a dark sense of humor. The name of their "moving company" actually contained the word MOSSAD embedded inside. Moving Systems Incorporated. MOving SyStems IncorporAteD...MOSSAD On October 10, 2001, CNN made a brief mention of a foiled terrorist bomb plot in the Mexican Parliament building. They promised to bring any further developments of this story to their viewers, but the incident was never heard of again in America.
But the story appeared in bold headlines on the front page of the major Mexican newspapers (2) and was also posted on the official website of the Mexican Justice Department. (3)
Two terror suspects were apprehended in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies. Caught red-handed, they had in their possession a high powered gun, nine hand grenades, and C-4 plastic explosives (great stuff for demolishing buildings!) Within days, this blockbuster story not only disappeared from the Mexican press, but the Israelis were quietly released and deported!
The two terrorists were Salvador Gerson Sunke and Sar ben Zui. Can you guess what their ethnicity was? Sunke was a Mexican jew and Zui was a colonel with the Israeli special forces (MOSSAD). (4) The story in El Diario de Mexico went on to reveal that the Zionist terrorists had fake Pakistani passports on them. Can you say "false flag operation?" The probable motive of this particular botched terrorist operation was to involve oil rich Mexico in the "War on Terrorism".
(The War on Israel's enemies would be a more accurate description).
Mexico is no military power, but the psychological trauma of an "Arab" attack on Mexico would surely have induced Mexico to provide unlimited cheap oil to her American "protector".
With cheap oil flowing to America at low prices from Mexico, the US could better afford to break off relations with the oil rich Arab states in general and Saudi Arabia in particular. That's why the planners chose 15 Saudi identities to steal for the 9-11 operation. Many Mexicans expressed shock at the release of the two Israelis. But when you learn that Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Relations is a Zionist named Jorge Gutman, it's not surprising!
The Zionist tentacles reach even into Mexico! La Voz de Aztlan (Mexican-American news service), in it's excellent investigative report revealed:
"La Voz de Aztlan has learned that the Israeli Embassy used heavy handed measures to have the two Israelis released. Very high level emergency meetings took place between Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Jorge Gutman, General Macedo de la Concha and a top Ariel Sharon envoy who flew to Mexico City specially for that purpose. Elías Luf of the Israeli Embassy worked night and day and their official spokeswoman Hila Engelhart went into high gear after many hours of complete silence. What went on during those high level meetings no one knows, but many in Mexico are in disbelief at their release." (5)
"La Voz de Aztlan has learned that the Israeli Embassy used heavy handed measures to have the two Israelis released. Very high level emergency meetings took place between Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Jorge Gutman, General Macedo de la Concha and a top Ariel Sharon envoy who flew to Mexico City specially for that purpose.
Elías Luf of the Israeli Embassy worked night and day and their official spokeswoman Hila Engelhart went into high gear after many hours of complete silence. What went on during those high level meetings no one knows, but many in Mexico are in disbelief at their release." (5)
In November of 2001, 6 more suspicious Israelis were detained in an unspecified mid-eastern state. They had in their possession box cutters, oil pipeline plans, and nuclear power plant plans. (6)
The local police called in the Feds and Immigration officials took over the scene and released the men without calling the FBI. The Jerusalem Post, the Miami Herald, (7) and the Times of London (8) all carried this amazing story and all revealed how furious FBI officials were that these terror suspects with nuclear power plant plans were allowed to go free.
Of course, the corruption riddled FBI would only have caved into Zionist pressure from the Justice Department's Criminal Division boss, Michael Chertoff, and also from the ADL's "partner", FBI boss Robert Mueller - who would no doubt have found a way to eventually release those Israeli terror suspects too. In December, 2001, the Los Angeles Times published the story of how two jewish terrorists were arrested by the FBI for plotting to blow up the office of US Congressman of Arab descent - Darrell Issa (R- CA), and a California mosque. (9) Irv Rubin and Earl Kruger of the Jewish Defense League (JDL) were charged with conspiracy to destroy a building by means of explosives. This story got brief national coverage but quickly disappeared too.
These Zionists sure love blowing up buildings and killing innocent people don't they? In May of 2002, yet another moving van was pulled over in Oak Harbor, Washington near the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. Fox News reported that the van was pulled over for speeding shortly after midnight. The passengers told the police they were delivering furniture, but because it was so late at night, the police weren't buying the story.
A bomb sniffing dog was brought in and the dog detected the presence of TNT and RDX plastic explosives in the truck (great stuff for demolishing buildings!) Both Fox News (10) and the Ha'aretz newspaper of Israel (11) reported that the two "movers" were Israelis. In December, 2002, Ariel Sharon made the amazing claim that Al-Qaeda agents were operating inside of Israel. But when Palestinian authorities apprehended the suspects, they turned out to be Palestinian traitors impersonating Al-qaeda agents for the MOSSAD!
From the Sydney Morning Herald of Australia:
"Palestinian security forces have arrested a group of Palestinians for collaborating with Israel and posing as operatives of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda terrorist network, a senior official said yesterday. ..The arrests come two days after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon charged al-Qaeda militants were operating in Gaza and in Lebanon. It was considered a surprise because the Gaza Strip is virtually sealed off by Israeli troops. The hard-line Israeli leader also charged other members of the terror group were cooperating with Lebanon's Shi'ite militia Hizbollah" (12)
You know, if Sharon wasn't so dangerous, I'd almost be amused by his bullshit! According to FOX news, throughout late 2000 and 2001, a total of 200 Israeli spies were arrested. (13) It was the largest spy ring to ever be uncovered in the history of the United States. The Washington Post also reported that some of these Israelis were arrested in connection with the 9-11 investigation. (14)
US. Carl Cameron of FOX News Channel did a excellent four part, nationally televised, series of investigations into this blockbuster scandal. But FOX pulled the investigative series after Zionist groups complained to FOX executives. FOX even went so far as to remove the written transcripts of the series from its website! In it's place was posted a chilling, Orwellian message which reads:
"This story no longer exists." (15)
Fortunately for the sake of history, the FOX transcripts were copied onto to many other websites and all four parts are available for your review. (see footnotes.) The FOX series and other mainstream news media sources revealed that many of these Israelis were army veterans with electronics and explosives expertise. Many of them failed lie detector tests.
FBI agents told FOX that some of their past investigations were compromised because suspects had been tipped off by Israeli wiretapping specialists. It was discovered that Israeli companies such as Comverse and Amdocs have the capability to tap American telephones (great for blackmailing all those wife-cheating politicians!)
FBI agents also told FOX they believed the Israelis had advance knowledge of the 9-11 attacks. (which certainly would explain why no Israelis died in the WTC) Still another US official informed FOX that some of the detained Israelis actually had links to 9-11, but he refused to describe the nature of those links.
The FBI official told FOX's Carl Cameron:
"Evidence linking these Israelis to 9-11 is classified. I cannot tell you about the evidence that has been gathered. It is classified information." (16)
Then there was that small army of Israeli "art students" who were arrested for trying to sneak into secured US Federal buildings and staking out 36 Department of Defense sites. Some of these suspicious "art students" even showed up at the homes of Federal employees. (17)
Ron Hatchett, a Department of Defense analyst, told Channel 11, KHOU news in Houston that he believed that the "art students" were gathering intelligence for future attacks.
Here's an excerpt from the October 1, 2001 KHOU investigative report by Anna Werner:
"Could federal buildings in Houston and other cities be under surveillance by foreign groups? That's what some experts are asking after federal law enforcement and security officials - nationally and in Houston - described for the 11 News Defenders a curious pattern of behavior by a group of people claiming to be Israeli art students." "Hatchett says they could be doing what he would be doing if he were a terrorist, sizing up the situation: "We need to know what are the entrances to this particular building. We need to know what are the surveillance cameras that are operating. We need to know how many guards are at this operation, when do they take breaks?" Says Hatchett: This is not a bunch of kids selling artwork." "A former Defense Department analyst, Hatchett believes groups may be gathering intelligence for possible future attacks. "Some organization, thinking in terms of a potential retaliation against the U.S. government could be scouting out potential targets and . looking for targets that would be vulnerable."
And a source tells the Defenders of another federal memo, stating that besides Houston and Dallas, the same thing has happened at sites in New York, Florida, and six other states, and even more worrisome, at 36 sensitive Department of Defense sites.
"One defense site you can explain," says Hatchett, "well that was just a serendipitous,...Thirty-six? That's a pattern." (18)
A Federal memo stated that these "art students" may have had ties to an "Islamic terror group".
More likely, they were the "Islamic terror group"! Remember the bombing of the King David Hotel in 1946, and how the "Arab terrorists" were actually Irgun terrorists? Remember the Zionist terrorists caught in Mexico with Arab passports?
Remember the official motto of the Mossad - By Way of Deception Thou Shalt Do War. Are you getting the picture? Can you say "false flag operations"? In a follow up report a few days later, KHOU Channel 11 revealed that Dallas was also targetted:
"11 News reported how people claiming to be "Israeli art students" might be trying to sneak into federal buildings and defense sites, and even doing surveillance. And at least one expert said he thought it could all be preparation for an attack. Well, now federal sources say they are not ruling out that all of this could be connected with the hijackings on September 11, because of events in another Texas city. In Dallas, the so-called students hit early this year at the city's FBI building, the Drug Enforcement Administration and at the Earle Cabell Federal building, where guards found one student wandering the halls with a floor plan of the building. So the Dallas INS went on the alert, finding and arresting 15 people in March. Thirteen claimed to be Israelis and two are professed Colombians. But according to sources, once again their passports were phony. And another federal source says some of those arrested also appeared to have lists of federal employees and their home addresses. All 15 "students" have now been deported. Now, since our first story ran Sunday night, some viewers called who said that they've been visited by people who claim to be Israeli students selling art." (19)
Absolutely mind boggling!
Why were Israeli explosives experts, posing as "art students" roaming the halls of US Federal buildings?
Why were Israeli army vets, armed with explosives and detonators, roaming the halls of the Mexican Congress?
Why were Israeli "movers" caught invans with explosives residue ?
Might some of these shady characters have once also "roamed the halls" of the World Trade Center prior to 9-11?
Why aren't "60 minutes", "Nightline", "20/20", and the rest of the Zionist media aggressively pursuing the story behind the Israeli "art students" and "movers" with 1/1,000th the zeal that they pursued Martha Stewart over allegations of insider trading (who cares?), or 1/10,000th the zeal that they pursued the Catholic Church over an occasional pedophile priest?
Funny how we never hear about the documented cases of pedophile rabbis!, or 1/100,000th the zeal that they pursue the Muslim bogeyman on a daily basis? Something smells rotten here! One would think that these intriguing mysteries would have great TV audience appeal, especially in light of the fact that the Oklahoma Federal building was blown up in 1995 by the since executed Timothy McVeigh (dead men tell no tales), and a "John Doe # 2" of "Middle- Eastern appearance", who was never tracked down or pursued despite numerous eye-witness accounts and despite an FBI All Points Bulletin which clearly described him as such. Of America's major networks, only FOX News made a meager attempt to investigate these mysteries, but FOX was quickly silenced by Zionist pressure. This alone is evidence of criminal activity!
Before his excellent work was silenced, FOX's Carl Cameron reported this amazing bit of information:
"Investigators within the DEA, INS, and FBI have all told FOX News that to pursue or even suggest Israeli spying is considered career suicide."(20)
Did you catch that? If a Federal investigator dares to "even suggest" Israeli spying, he has committed "career suicide"!
And if a journalist like FOX's Cameron dares to bring this scandal to light, he is told to shut his mouth. If they persist, they may even be called "anti-Semitic" - a label which has served as the kiss of death for many a career.
This means that Zionist Mafia can do whatever it wants, whenever it wants, and however it wants - including orchestrating, financing, executing, and covering up the true story of events in the Middle East, the 9-11 massacre, and the ensuing "War on Terrorism" (war on Israel's enemies). Now do you remember the Mossad's "warning" about the 200 "Al-Qaeda terrorists" said to have been preparing major attacks in the US? (21) At the time of this writing, we are one year into the largest investigation in American history, and not one of these 200 "terrorists" has yet to be uncovered. (22)
But 200 Israeli spies were uncovered, among them many military members, electronics experts, wiretapping and phone tapping specialists, and explosives experts with the skill to bring down tall buildings. (23)
Logic and common sense leads to the conclusion that the "200 Al Qaeda terrorists" were in reality, 200 Zionist terrorists sent to frame the Arabs for terrorist attacks and drag America into a war. On December 11, 2002, Senator Bob Graham (D-FL), a leading member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, appeared as a guest on the PBS Newshour with Gwen Ifill. Graham surprised Ifill by expressing his belief that a foreign government or governments had to have funded and supported the hijackers.
Here's part of the exchange:
IFILL: "Are you suggesting that you are convinced that there was a state sponsor behind 9/11?" GRAHAM: "I think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted not just in financing - although that was part of it - by a sovereign foreign government and that we have been derelict in our duty to track that down, make the further case, or find the evidence that would indicate that that is not true and we can look for other reasons why the terrorists were able to function so effectively in the United States." IFILL: "Do you think that will ever become public, which countries you're talking about?"
Now listen to Graham's bombshell.........:
GRAHAM: "It will become public at some point when it's turned over to the archives, but that's 20 or 30 years from now. And, we need to have this information now because it's relevant to the threat that the people of the United States are facing today." (24)
Senator Graham is suggesting that US intelligence knows which foreign government helped the terrorists, but the government isn't going to tell us for another 30 years!
Given the current state of anti-Muslim war hysteria being promoted by the media and government, common sense dictates that if an Arab government was ever discovered to have sponsored 9-11, we'd be seeing the evidence night and day on the controlled media, and hearing about it non-stop from all the President's warmongers as well as the Israeli-occupied US Congress and Senate.
This alone is evidence that no Arab government was involved in 9-11. It can't be an Arab government.
Why would any Arab government sponsor "Al-qaeda", an organization dedicated to overthrowing what it sees as corrupt, US-backed Arab governments?
What Arab government would have incentive to attack America- its best oil purchasing customer?
What Arab government would have the ability to shield itself from US media exposure?
What Arab government would be so suicidal, so hell-bent on its own destruction, as to attack a mighty nuclear superpower like the United States?
So who, if not an Arab government could be the chief sponsor of 9-11?
Again, let's go back to FOX News quoting an FBI official. Pay close attention to the specific language used:
"Evidence linking these Israelis to 9-11 is classified. I cannot tell you about the evidence that has been gathered. It is classified information." (25)
In order for evidence "linking these Israelis to 9-11" to become classified, the evidence has to have existed in the first place! Furthermore, but it must have been very, very serious stuff indeed.
Only the really ugly stuff merits the distinction of being "classified!" It may be possible that the good Senator doesn't know himself which country or countries are involved. Graham may still be under the delusion that it's an Arab government. Or, perhaps he's a disgusted patriot just trying to throw a subtle shot at Israel in his own little way, without actually having to commit "career suicide" as so many other anti-Zionist politicians have in the past.
History will reveal the truth one day, just as it did for Pearl Harbor. The trouble is, by that time, no one will care about 9-11 and this phony war "War on Terrorism" anymore. The American attention span does not reach "20-30 years".
It's closer to 20-30 minutes, about the length of an average Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, or Tom Brokaw infomercial. If even that! History always repeats itself.
But who will teach this history to the American people when the Zionists control the information industry? The Zionist Mafia and their ass-kissing careerist henchmen in media, government, academia, and business have all of the bases covered.
The Five Dancing Israelis Arrested On 9-11
On the day of the 9-11 attacks, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked what the attacks would mean for US- Israeli relations. His quick reply was: "It's very good. Well, it's not good, but it will generate immediate sympathy (for Israel)"
A Mossad surveillance team made quite a public spectacle of themselves on 9-11. The New York Times reported Thursday that a group of five men had set up video cameras aimed at the Twin Towers prior to the attack on Tuesday, and were seen congratulating one another afterwards. (1)
Police received several calls from angry New Jersey residents claiming "middle-eastern" men with a white van were videotaping the disaster with shouts of joy and mockery. (2)
"They were like happy, you know They didn't look shocked to me" said a witness. (3)
[T]hey were seen by New Jersey residents on Sept. 11 making fun of the World Trade Center ruins and going to extreme lengths to photograph themselves in front of the wreckage. (4) Witnesses saw them jumping for joy in Liberty State Park after the initial impact (5).
Later on, other witnesses saw them celebrating on a roof in Weehawken, and still more witnesses later saw them celebrating with high fives in a Jersey City parking lot. (6)
"It looked like they're hooked in with this. It looked like they knew what was going to happen when they were at Liberty State Park." (7)
One anonymous phone call to the authorities actually led them to close down all of New York's bridges and tunnels. The mystery caller told the 9-1-1 dispatcher that a group of Palestinians were mixing a bomb inside of a white van headed for the Holland Tunnel.
Here's the transcript from NBC News:
Dispatcher: Jersey City police. Caller: Yes, we have a white van, 2 or 3 guys in there, they look like Palestinians and going around a building. Caller: There's a minivan heading toward the Holland tunnel, I see the guy by Newark Airport mixing some junk and he has those sheikh uniform. Dispatcher: He has what? Caller: He's dressed like an Arab. (8)
Dispatcher: Jersey City police.
Caller: Yes, we have a white van, 2 or 3 guys in there, they look like Palestinians and going around a building.
Caller: There's a minivan heading toward the Holland tunnel, I see the guy by Newark Airport mixing some junk and he has those sheikh uniform.
Dispatcher: He has what?
Caller: He's dressed like an Arab. (8)
* Writer's note: Why would this mystery caller specifically say that these "Arabs" were Palestinians? How would he know that? Palestinians usually dress in western style clothes, not "sheikh uniforms" Based on that phone call, police then issued a "Be-on-the-Lookout" alert for a white mini-van heading for the city's bridges and tunnels from New Jersey. White, 2000 Chevrolet van with 'Urban Moving Systems' sign on back seen at Liberty State Park, Jersey City, NJ, at the time of first impact of jetliner into World Trade Center Three individuals with van were seen celebrating after initial impact and subsequent explosion. FBI Newark Field Office requests that, if the van is located, hold for prints and detain individuals. (9)
When a van fitting that exact description was stopped just before crossing into New York, the suspicious "middle-easterners" were apprehended. Imagine the surprise of the police officers when these terror suspects turned out to be Israelis!
According to ABCs 20/20, when the van belonging to the cheering Israelis was stopped by the police, the driver of the van, Sivan Kurzberg, told the officers:
"We are Israelis. We are not your problem. Your problems are our problems. The Palestinians are your problem." (10)
Why did he feel Palestinians were a problem for the NYPD? The police and FBI field agents became very suspicious when they found maps of the city with certain places highlighted, box cutters (the same items that the hijackers supposedly used), $4700 cash stuffed in a sock, and foreign passports. Police also told the Bergen Record that bomb sniffing dogs were brought to the van and that they reacted as if they had smelled explosives. (11) The FBI seized and developed their photos, one of which shows Sivan Kurzberg flicking a cigarette lighter in front of the smoldering ruins in an apparently celebratory gesture. (12)
The Jerusalem Post later reported that a white van with a bomb was stopped as it approached the George Washington Bridge, but the ethnicity of the suspects was not revealed. Here's what the Jerusalem Post reported on September 12, 2001:
American security services overnight stopped a car bomb on the George Washington Bridge. The van, packed with explosives, was stopped on an approach ramp to the bridge. Authorities suspect the terrorists intended to blow up the main crossing between New Jersey and New York, Army Radio reported. (13) "...two suspects are in FBI custody after a truckload of explosives was discovered around the George Washington Bridge... The FBI... says enough explosives were in the truck to do great damage to the George Washington Bridge." WMV video download (545kB) It was reported the van contained tonnes of explosives.(14)
What's really intriguing is that ABC's 20/20 (15), the New York Post (16), and the New Jersey Bergen Record (17) all clearly and unambiguously reported that a white van with Israelis was intercepted on a ramp near Route 3, which leads directly to the Lincoln Tunnel. But the Jerusalem Post, Israeli National News (Arutz Sheva) (18), and Yediot America, (19) all reported, just as clearly and unambiguously, that a white van with Israelis was stopped on a ramp leading to the George Washington Bridge, which is several miles north of the Lincoln Tunnel. It appears as if there may actually have been two white vans involved, one stopped on each crossing.
This would not only explain the conflicting reports as to the actual location of the arrests, but would also explain how so many credible eye-witnesses all saw celebrating "middle-easterners" in a white van in so many different locations. It also explains why the New York Post and Steve Gordon (lawyer for the 5 Israelis) originally described how three Israelis were arrested but later increased the total to five. Perhaps one van was meant to drop off a bomb while the other was meant to pick up the first set of drivers while re-crossing back into New Jersey? If a van was to be used as a parked time-bomb on the GW Bridge, then certainly the drivers would need to have a "get- away van" to pick them up and escape.
And notice how the van (or vans) stayed away from the third major crossing -the Holland Tunnel- which was where the police had originally been directed to by that anti-Palestinian 9-1-1 "mystery caller". A classic misdirection play. From there, the story gets becomes even more suspicious. The Israelis worked for a Weehawken moving company known as Urban Moving Systems. An American employee of Urban Moving Systems told the The Record of New Jersey that a majority of his co-workers were Israelis and they were joking about the attacks. The employee, who declined to give his name said:
"I was in tears. These guys were joking and that bothered me."
These guys were like,
"Now America knows what we go through." (20)
A few days after the attacks, Urban Moving System's Israeli owner, Dominick Suter, dropped his business and fled the country for Israel. He was in such a hurry to flee America that some of Urban Moving System's customers were left with their furniture stranded in storage facilities (21). Suter's departure was abrupt, leaving behind coffee cups, sandwiches, cell phones and computers strewn on office tables and thousands of dollars of goods in storage. Suter was later placed on the same FBI suspect list as 9/11 lead hijacker Mohammed Atta and other hijackers and suspected al-Qaeda sympathizers, suggesting that U.S. authorities felt Suter may have known something about the attacks. (22)
The Jewish weekly The Forward reported that the FBI finally concluded that at least two of the detained Israelis were agents working for the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that Urban Moving Systems, the ostensible employer of the five Israelis, was a front operation. This was confirmed by two former CIA officers, and they noted that movers' vans are a common intelligence cover. (23)
The Israelis were held in custody for 71 days before being quietly released. (24)
"There was no question but that [the order to close down the investigation] came from the White House. It was immediately assumed at CIA headquarters that this basically was going to be a cover-up so that the Israelis would not be implicated in any way in 9/11." (25)
Several of the detainees discussed their experience in America on an Israeli talk show after their return home. Said one of the men, denying that they were laughing or happy on the morning of Sept. 11,
"The fact of the matter is we are coming from a country that experiences terror daily. Our purpose was to document the event." (26)
How did they know there would be an event to document on 9/11?
It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to connect the dots of the dancing Israeli Mossad agents - here's the most logical scenario:
The Israeli "movers" cheered the 9-11 attacks to celebrate the successful accomplishment of the greatest spy operation ever pulled off in history.
One of them, or an accomplice, then calls a 9-1-1 police dispatcher to report Palestinian bomb-makers in a white van headed for the Holland Tunnel.
Having thus pre-framed the Palestinians with this phone call, the Israeli bombers then head for the George Washington Bridge instead, where they will drop off their time-bomb van and escape with Urban Moving accomplices.
But the police react very wisely and proactively by closing off ALL bridges and tunnels instead of just the Holland Tunnel. This move inadvertently foils the Israelis' misdirection play and leads to their own capture and 40 day torture.
To cover up this story, the U.S. Justice Department rounds up over 1000 Arabs for minor immigration violations and places them in New York area jails. The Israelis therefore become less conspicuous as the government and media can now claim that the Israelis were just immigration violators caught in the same dragnet as many other Arabs.
After several months, FBI and Justice Department "higher-ups" are able to gradually push aside the local FBI agents and free the Israelis quietly.
Osama bin Laden was immediately blamed for the 9/11 attacks even though he had no previous record of doing anything on this scale.
Immediately after the Flight 11 hit World Trade Center 1 CIA Director George Tenet said,
"You know, this has bin Laden's fingerprints all over it." (27)
The compliant mainstream media completely ignored the Israeli connection. Immediately following the 9-11 attacks the media was filled with stories linking the attacks to bin Laden. TV talking- heads, "experts", and scribblers of every stripe spoon-fed a gullible American public a steady diet of the most outrageous propaganda imaginable. We were told that the reason bin Laden attacked the USA was because he hates our "freedom" and "democracy". The Muslims were "medieval" and they wanted to destroy us because they envied our wealth, were still bitter about the Crusades, and were offended by Britney Spears shaking her tits and ass all over the place! But bin Laden strongly denied any role in the attacks and suggested that Zionists orchestrated the 9-11 attacks.
The BBC published bin Laden's statement of denial in which he said:
"I was not involved in the September 11 attacks in the United States nor did I have knowledge of the attacks. There exists a government within a government within the United States. The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity. That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.... The American system is totally in control of the Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States." (28)
"I was not involved in the September 11 attacks in the United States nor did I have knowledge of the attacks. There exists a government within a government within the United States. The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity.
That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.... The American system is totally in control of the Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States." (28)
You never heard that quote on your nightly newscast did you? [A] number of intelligence officials have raised questions about Osama bin Laden's capabilities.
"This guy sits in a cave in Afghanistan and he's running this operation?" one C.I.A. official asked. "It's so huge. He couldn't have done it alone."
A senior military officer told me that because of the visas and other documentation needed to infiltrate team members into the United States a major foreign intelligence service might also have been involved. (29) Bin Laden is not named as the perpetrator of 9/11 by the FBI: When asked why there is no mention of 9/11 on Bin Ladens Most Wanted web page (30), [Rex Tomb, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI] said,
The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Ladens Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11. (31) "So we've never made the case, or argued the case that somehow Osama bin Laden [sic] was directly involved in 9/11. That evidence has never been forthcoming" - Dick Cheney. (32)
The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Ladens Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11. (31)
"So we've never made the case, or argued the case that somehow Osama bin Laden [sic] was directly involved in 9/11. That evidence has never been forthcoming" - Dick Cheney. (32)
To date, the only shred of evidence to be uncovered against bin Laden is a barely audible fuzzy amateur video that the Pentagon just happened to find "lying around" in Afghanistan. How very convenient, and how very fake. (33) There is no evidence, be it hard or circumstantial, to link the Al Qaeda "terrorist network" to these acts of terror, but there is a mountain of evidence, both hard and circumstantial, which suggests that Zionists have been very busy framing Arabs for terror plots against America.
"I think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted not just in financing - although that was part of it - by a sovereign foreign government... It will become public at some point when it's turned over to the archives, but that's 20 or 30 years from now" - Senator Bob Graham. (34)
If the sovereign foreign government mentioned by Senator Graham was an enemy of the United States the "compelling evidence" would not be kept secret for 20+ years. One final point; at 09:40 on 9-11 it was reported that the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for the attacks (35).
This claim was immediately denied by the DFLP leader Qais abu Leila who said it had always opposed,
"terror attacks on civilian targets, especially outside the occupied territories." (36)
Why would a Palestinian organization comprising of less than 500 people (37) make the suicidal move of immediately claiming responsibility for the attacks?
Sharon and the other Israeli leaders aspire to fulfill what the goals of the political Zionist movement have been since its origin a century ago: to turn all of historic Palestine into an exclusively Jewish state.
A central tenet of the Zionist ideology is expressed in the racist slogan,
"A land without people for a people without a land." (38)
The implication of Palestinians in the 9/11 attacks would have handed Zionists a golden opportunity to achieve the above because all Palestinians would have been labeled terrorists.
"Evidence linking these Israelis to 9/11 is classified. I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered. It's classified information."
US official quoted in Carl Cameron's Fox News report on the Israeli spy ring.
"By way of deception, thou shalt do war" Motto of the Mossad
This story is so complicated and long, I've tried to break it into threads of different colors to make it easier to digest, as well as the main page, the page for the day of September 11, and the abridged timeline.

Ajaj is arrested at Kennedy Airport in New York City. Ramzi Yousef is not arrested, and later masterminds the 1993 bombing of the WTC (see February 26, 1993). "The US government was pretty sure Ahmad Ajaj was a terrorist from the moment he stepped foot on US soil," because his "suitcases were stuffed with fake passports, fake IDs and a cheat sheet on how to lie to US immigration inspectors," plus "two handwritten notebooks filled with bomb recipes, six bomb-making manuals, four how-to videotapes concerning weaponry and an advanced guide to surveillance training." However, Ajaj is only charged with passport fraud, and serves a six-month sentence. From prison, Ajaj frequently calls Ramzi Yousef and others in the WTC bombing plot, but no one monitors or translates the calls until long after the bombing. [Los Angeles Times, 10/14/01] An Israeli newsweekly later reports that the Palestinian Ajaj may have been a mole for the Israeli Mossad. The Village Voice has suggested that Ajaj may have had "advance knowledge of the World Trade Center bombing, which he shared with Mossad, and that Mossad, for whatever reason, kept the secret to itself." Ajaj was not just knowledgeable, but was involved in the planning of the bombing from his prison cell. [Village Voice, 8/3/93] Ajaj is released from prison three days after the WTC bombing, but is later rearrested and sentenced to more than 100 years in prison. [Los Angeles Times, 10/14/01] One of the manuals seized from Ajaj is horribly mistranslated for the trial. For instance, the title page is said to say "The Basic Rule," published in 1982, when in fact the title says "Al-Qaeda" (which means "the base" in English), published in 1989. Investigators later complain that a proper translation could have shown an early connection between al-Qaeda and the WTC bombing. [New York Times, 1/14/01] February 26, 1993 An attempt to blow up the WTC fails. Six people are killed in the misfired blast. Analysts later determine that had the terrorists not made a minor error in the placement of the bomb, both towers could have fallen and up to 50,000 people could have been killed. The attempt is organized by Ramzi Yousef, who has close ties to bin Laden. [Congressional Hearings, 2/24/98] The New York Times later reports on Emad Salem, an undercover agent who ends up being the key government witness in the trial against the bomber. Salem testifies that the FBI knew about the attack beforehand and told him they would thwart it by substituting a harmless powder for the explosives. However, this plan was called off by an FBI supervisor, and the bombing was not stopped. [New York Times, 10/28/93] Why did the FBI seemingly let the terrorists go ahead with the bombing? Others suspects are ineptly investigated before the bombing (see July 1990 and November 5, 1990). Several of the bombers were trained by the CIA to fight in the Afghan war, and the CIA later concludes in internal documents that it was "partly culpable" for this bombing attempt. [Independent, 11/1/98] Ahmad Ajaj, an associate of Yousef, may have been a mole for the Israeli Mossad, and the Mossad may have had advanced knowledge of the bombing (see September 1, 1992). US officials later state that the overall mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, is a close relative of Ramzi Yousef, [Independent, 6/6/02] probably his uncle. [Los Angeles Times, 9/1/02] One of the attackers even left a message found by investigators stating, "Next time, it will be very precise." 9/11 can be seen as a completion of this failed attack. [AP, 9/30/01] January 2000 (B) A DEA government document later leaked to the press [DEA report, 6/01] suggests that a large Israeli spy ring starts penetrating the US from at least this time, if not earlier. This ring, which will later become popularly known as the "art student spy ring," is later shown to have strange connections to the events of 9/11. [Insight, 3/11/02] February 6, 2000 India's largest newsweekly reports that it appears a recent Mossad attempt to infiltrate al-Qaeda failed when they were stopped by Indian customs officials on their way to Bangladesh. These 11 men appeared to be from Afghanistan, but had Israeli passports. One expert states, "It is not unlikely for Mossad to recruit 11 Afghans in Iran and grant them Israeli citizenship to penetrate a network such as Bin Laden's. They would begin by infiltrating them into an Islamic radical group in an unlikely place like Bangladesh." [The Week, 2/6/00] If this shows that Mossad was trying to infiltrate al-Qaeda, did they make other attempts that succeeded, and if so, is this how they learned enough to know where to trail al-Qaeda in the US via the "art student spy ring"? April 19, 2000 USA Today states that "Israeli crime groups... dominate distribution" of Ecstasy. [USA Today, 4/19/00] The DEA also states that most of the Ecstasy sold in the US is "controlled by organized crime figures in Western Europe, Russia and Israel." [UPI, 10/25/01] According to DEA documents, the Israeli "art student" spy ring" has been linked to several ongoing DEA [Ecstasy] investigations in Florida, California, Texas and New York now being closely coordinated by DEA headquarters." [Insight, 3/11/02] In addition to 9/11 connections explored later, was this spy ring meant to obstruct DEA prosecution of Israeli organized crime? December 2000-April 2001 According to later German reports, "a whole horde of Israeli counter-terror investigators, posing as students, [follow] the trails of Arab terrorists and their cells in the United States... In the town of Hollywood, Florida, they [identify]... Atta and Marwan Alshehhi as possible terrorists. Agents [live] in the vicinity of the apartment of the two seemingly normal flight school students, observing them around the clock." Supposedly, around April, the Israeli agents are discovered and deported, terminating the investigation. [Der Spiegel, 10/1/02] However, 80 additional agents are apprehended between June and December 2001 [Fox News, 12/12/01] and even more have been uncovered since (see May 7, 2002). Did the surveillance of Atta and others in fact end in April? Other reports have implied the story and connection (see March 5, 2002). Supposedly, the Mossad waits until late August 2001 before informing the CIA what it learns, and the CIA doesn't take the warning seriously (see August 23, 2001). January 21, 2001 George Bush Jr. is inaugurated as the 43rd US President, replacing Clinton. The only major figure to permanently remain in office is CIA Director Tenet, appointed in 1997 and reputedly a long time friend of Bush Sr. FBI Director Louis Freeh stays on until June 2001. March 23, 2001 The Office of National Drug Control Policy issues a National Security Alert describing "apparent attempts by Israeli nationals to learn about government personnel and office layouts." This later comes to light through a leaked Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) document called "Suspicious Activities Involving Israeli Art Students at DEA Facilities." A crackdown ensues and by June around 120 Israelis are apprehended. More are apprehended later. [Read the document here: DEA report, 6/01] June 2001 (G) A 60-page internal memo on the Israeli "art student" spy ring is prepared by the DEA's Office of Security Programs. [Read the memo here: DEA report, 6/01] The memo is a compilation of dozens of field reports, and was meant only for the eyes of senior officials at the Justice Department (of which the DEA is adjunct), but it is leaked to the press around December 2001. The report connects the spies to efforts to foil investigations into Israeli organized crime activity involving the importation of the drug Ecstasy. The spies also appear to be snooping on top secret military bases. For instance, on April 30, 2001, an Air Force alert was issued from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City concerning "possible intelligence collection being conducted by Israeli Art Students." Tinker AFB houses AWACS surveillance craft and Stealth bombers. By the time of the report, the US has "apprehended or expelled close to 120 Israeli nationals" but many remain at large. [Le Monde, 3/5/02, Salon, 5/7/02] An additional 20 or so Israeli spies are apprehended between June and 9/11. [Fox News, 12/12/01] August 8-15, 2001 At some point between these dates, Israel warns the US that an al-Qaeda attack is imminent. [Fox News, 5/17/02] Two high ranking agents from the Mossad come to Washington and warn the FBI and CIA that from 50 to 200 terrorists have slipped into the US and are planning "a major assault on the United States." They say indications point to a "large scale target", and that Americans would be "very vulnerable." They add there could be Iraqi connections to the al-Qaeda attack. [Telegraph, 9/16/01, Los Angeles Times, 9/20/01, Ottawa Citizen, 9/17/01] The Los Angeles Times later retracts the story after a CIA spokesman says, "There was no such warning. Allegations that there was are complete and utter nonsense." [Los Angeles Times, 9/21/01] In light of later revelations of a Mossad spy ring trailing numerous Muslim terrorists in the US, it is easy to see that Mossad would have known this info. Could this be later disinformation by the Mossad to spin the spy ring story and blame Iraq for 9/11, or it is another smoking gun showing extensive US foreknowledge? August 23, 2001 According to German newspapers, the Mossad gives the CIA a list of terrorists living in the US and say that they appear to be planning to carry out an attack in the near future. It is unknown if these are the 19 9/11 hijackers or if the number is a coincidence. However, four names on the list are known and are names of the 9/11 hijackers: Nawaf Alhazmi, Khalid Almihdhar, Marwan Alshehhi, and Mohamed Atta. [Die Zeit, 10/1/02, Der Spiegel, 10/1/02, BBC, 10/2/02, Haaretz, 10/3/02] The Mossad appears to have learned about this through its "art student" spy ring (see for instance, March 5, 2002). Yet apparently this warning and list are not treated as particularly urgent by the CIA and also not passed on to the FBI. It's not clear if this warning influenced the adding of Alhazmi and Almihdhar to a terrorism watch list on this same day, and if so, why only those two. [Der Spiegel, 10/1/02] Israel has denied that there were any Mossad agents in the US. [Haaretz, 10/3/02] The US has denied knowing about Atta before 9/11, despite other media reports to the contrary (see January-May 2000). September 4, 2001 (D) Zim-American Israeli Shipping Co. moves their North American headquarters from the 16th floor of the WTC to Norfolk, Virginia, one week before the 9/11 attacks. The Israeli government owns 49 percent of the company. [Virginian-Pilot, 9/4/01] Zim announced the move and its date six months earlier. [Virginian- Pilot, 4/3/01] More than 200 workers had just been moved out; about 10 are still in the building making final moving arrangements on 9/11, but escape alive. [Jerusalem Post, 9/13/01, Journal of Commerce, 10/18/01] The move leaves only one Israeli company, ClearForest, with 18 employees, in the WTC on 9/11. The four or five employees in the building at the time manage to escape. [Jerusalem Post, 9/13/01] One year later, a Zim ship is impounded attempting to ship Israeli military equipment to Iran; it is speculated that this is done with the knowledge of Israel. [AFP, 8/29/02 (B)] Given the Israeli government ties, the Odigo warning (see September 11, 2001 (C)), and the Israeli art student spy ring (see December 2000-April 2001), some have speculated that the move was more than just lucky. September 10, 2001 (B) An Army School of Advanced Military Studies issues a report written by elite US army officers, which is made public just prior to 9/11. The report gives the following description for the Mossad: "Wildcard. Ruthless and cunning. Has capability to target US forces and make it look like a Palestinian/ Arab act." [Washington Times, 9/10/01] After 9/11 and revelations of a large Mossad spy ring operating mysteriously in the US, some suggest that the Mossad did in fact do just that on 9/11. September 11, 2001 (C) Two employees of Odigo, Inc., in Israel, receive warnings of an imminent attack in New York City around two hours before the first plane hits the WTC. Odigo, one of the world's largest instant messaging companies, has its headquarters two blocks from the WTC. The Odigo Research and Development offices where the warnings were received are located in Herzliyya, a suburb of Tel Aviv. Israeli security and the FBI were notified immediately after the 9/11 attacks began. The two employees claim not to know who sent the warnings. "Odigo service includes a feature called People Finder that allows users to seek out and contact others based on certain interests or demographics. [Alex] Diamandis [Odigo vice president of sales and marketing] said it was possible that the attack warning was broadcast to other Odigo members, but the company has not received reports of other recipients of the message." [Ha'aretz, 9/26/01, Washington Post, 9/27/01 (C)] FTW Odigo claims the warning did not specifically mention the WTC, but the company won't say what was specified, claiming, "Providing more details would only lead to more conjecture." [Washington Post, 9/28/01] Odigo gave the FBI the internet address of the message's sender so the name of the sender could be found. [Deutsche Presse-Agentur, 9/26/01] Two months later it is reported that the FBI is still investigating the matter, but there have been no reports since. [Courier Mail, 11/20/01] Could the message have been a mass e-mail sent to a large group? Could this be related to the "art student spy ring"? Did the original senders directly inform the FBI as well, and if not, why not? September 11, 2001 (G) The 9/11 attack: four planes are hijacked, two crash into the WTC, one into the Pentagon, and one crashes into the Pennsylvania countryside. At least 3,000 people are killed. A more detailed timeline focusing on the hours of this attack appears on a separate page. September 11, 2001 (W) Five Israelis are arrested for "puzzling behavior" related to the WTC attacks. They are arrested around 4:30 P.M. after having filmed the burning WTC from the roof of their company's building near Liberty State Park, then shouting in what was interpreted as cries of joy and mockery. They were spotted by a neighbor who called the police and the FBI. The police tracked them down in a van with the words "Urban Moving Systems" written on the side. [Bergen Record, 9/12/01, Ha'aretz, 9/17/01] One man was found with $4,700 in cash hidden in his sock, another had two passports on him, and a box cutter was found in the van. [ABC News, 6/21/02] Investigators say that "There are maps of the city in the car with certain places highlighted... It looked like they're hooked in with this. It looked like they knew what was going to happen." [Bergen Record, 9/12/01] One of these Israelis later says, "Our purpose was to document the event." [ABC News, 6/21/02] The FBI later concludes at least two are Mossad agents and that all were on a Mossad surveillance mission. The FBI interrogates them for weeks. [Forward, 3/15/02] They are held on immigration violation charges and released 71 days later. [ABC News, 6/21/02] Their names are later identified as Sivan and Paul Kurzberg, Oded Ellner, Omer Marmari and Yaron Shmuel. [Forward, 3/15/02] September 11 , 2001 (X) An FAA memo written on the evening of 9/11 suggests a man on Flight 11 was shot and killed by a gun before the plane crashed into the WTC. [See the leaked FAA memo, originally posted at World Net Daily] The "Executive Summary," based on information relayed by a flight attendant to the American Airlines Operation Center, stated "that a passenger located in seat 10B shot and killed a passenger in seat 9B at 9:20 A.M. [since Flight 11 crashed at 8:46, the time must be a typo, probably meaning 8:20]. The passenger killed was Daniel Lewin, shot by passenger Satam Al Suqami." The FAA claims that the document is a "first draft" and declines to release the final draft, calling it "protected information." A report in Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz on September 17 identifies Lewin as a former member of the Israel Defense Force Sayeret Matkal, Israel's most successful special-operations unit. [UPI, 3/6/02]. Sayeret Matkal is a deep-penetration unit that has been involved in assassinations, the theft of foreign signals- intelligence materials, and the theft and destruction of foreign nuclear weaponry. Sayeret Matkal is best known for the 1976 rescue of 106 passengers at Entebbe Airport in Uganda. [New Yorker, 10/29/01] Officials later deny the gun story and suggest that Lewin was probably stabbed to death instead (which would still be very interesting). [UPI, 3/6/02, Washington Post, 3/2/02] Note that Lewin founded Akamai, a successful computer company, and his connections to Sayeret Mat'kal remained hidden until the gun story came to light. [Guardian, 9/15/01] Perhaps Lewin just happened to be there, and, with his past training, tried to be a hero and stop the hijack? What are the odds that an Israeli counter-terrorist expert would not only be on this hijacked flight, but also have terrorists sitting in the seats directly in front and behind him? September 11, 2001 (BB) Former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, when asked what the 9/11 attacks mean for relations between the US and Israel, replies, "It's very good." Then he edited himself: "Well, not very good, but it will generate immediate sympathy." [New York Times, 9/12/01] A week later, the Village Voice states, "From national networks to small-town newspapers, the view that America's terrible taste of terrorism will finally do away with even modest calls for the restraint of Israel's military attacks on Palestinian towns has become an instant, unshakable axiom.... Now, support for Israel in America is officially absolute, and Palestinians are cast once again as players in a global terrorist conspiracy." [Village Voice, 9/19/01] September 14, 2001 (approx.) According to Seymour Hersh of the New Yorker, a few days after 9/11 members of the elite Israeli counter- terrorism unit Sayeret Matkal arrive in the US and begin training with US Special Forces in a secret location. The two groups are developing contingency plans to attack Pakistan's military bases and remove its nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government or the nuclear weapons fall into the wrong hands. [New Yorker, 10/29/01] There may have been threats to enact this plan on September 13, 2001 (see September 11-16, 2001). The Japan Times later notes that this "threat to divest Pakistan of its 'crown jewels' was cleverly used by the US, first to force Musharraf to support its military campaign in Afghanistan, and then to warn would-be coup plotters against Musharraf." [Japan Times, 11/10/01] Note the curious connection between Sayeret Matkal and one of the 9/11 passengers on Flight 11 (see September 11, 2001 (X)). September 14, 2001 (K) Dominick Suter, owner of the company Urban Moving Systems, flees the country to Israel. The FBI later tells ABC News that "Urban Moving may have been providing cover for an Israeli intelligence operation." Suter has been tied to the five Israeli agents caught filming the WTC attack. The FBI had questioned him around September 12, removing boxes of documents and a dozen computer hard drives. But when they returned a few days later, Suter is gone (see September 11, 2001 (W)). [Forward, 3/15/02, New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, 12/13/01, ABC News, 6/21/01] September 29-30, 2001 Police in the Midwest stop six men carrying suspicious documents. They possess photos and descriptions of a nuclear power plant in Florida and the Trans-Alaska pipeline, and also have "box cutters and other equipment." All six have Israeli passports. They are let released the same day after their passports are shown to be valid, but before anyone interviews them. The FBI is reportedly furious about their release. [Miami Herald, 10/3/01, Knight Ridder, 10/31/01, London Times, 11/2/01] The six men may have been Mossad agents. In addition to snooping on the DEA and Muslim terrorists, some Mossad agents in the "art student" spy ring have been caught trying to break into military bases and other top secret facilities. [Salon, 5/7/02] Perhaps they were gathering information, not planning a hijack? October 16, 2001 (C) Two men, Moshe Elmakias and Ron Katar, are arrested after being found with a detailed video of the Sears Tower in Chicago. In addition, a woman named Ayelet Reisler is found with them, carrying conflicting identification information. They are arrested for illegal dumping, using a van with the name Moving Systems Incorporated. The video contains extensive zoom in shots of the Sears Tower; it is not known when the video was filmed. [Philadelphia Mercury, 10/18/01] Given the moving van cover (see September 11, 2001 (W) and [DEA report, 6/01]), and the Jewish names, it is likely these three are part of the Israeli spy ring. Could they have been videotaping the Sears Tower on 9/11 in the expectation that it would be hit by a plane? Had Flight 93 not been delayed 40 minutes on the runway and stayed on course, it would have been near Chicago at the same time as the other attacks, and it turned towards Washington 20 minutes after the FAA informed the military that the plane had been hijacked. November 20, 2001 The five Israelis arrested on 9/11 for videotaping the WTC attack and then cheering about it (see September 11, 2001 (W)) are released and return to Israel. Some of the men's names appeared in a US national intelligence database, and the FBI concluded that at least two of the men were working for the Mossad, according to ABC News. But the FBI says that none of them had any advanced knowledge of the 9/11 attacks, and they were released as part of a deal between the US and the Israel government. After their release they claim to have been tortured. [Forward, 3/15/02, ABC News, 6/21/02] November 23, 2001 (B) The Washington Post reports, "At least 60 young Israeli Jews have been arrested and detained around the country on immigration charges since the Sept. 11 attacks, many of them held on US government officials' invocation of national security." An INS official who requested anonymity says the use of the term "special interest" for Israelis being held in Cleveland, St. Louis and other places means the case in question is "related to the investigation of September 11th." [Washington Post, 11/23/01] Could this be more "art school" spy ring activity? December 12-15, 2001 Fox News broadcasts a remarkable series about the Israeli "art student" spy ring. The report mentions that at least 60 more Israelis have been detained or arrested since 9/11. "There is no indication that the Israelis were involved in the 9/11 attacks, but investigators suspect that the Israelis may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance, and not shared it." When a government source is asked if the Israeli spies knew about the 9/11 attacks before they happened, he responds, "The principal question is 'how could they have not known?'" "Investigators within the DEA, INS and FBI have all told Fox News that to pursue or even suggest Israeli spying... is considered career suicide." A highly placed investigator says there are 'tie- ins' between the spy ring and 9/11. But when asked for details, he flatly refuses to describe them, saying, "evidence linking these Israelis to 9-11 is classified. I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered. It's classified information." The report also reveals that Amdocs, an Israeli company, is recording virtually every phone call in the US and could be passing information on to the Israeli government (similar claims were first raised in 2000 [Insight, 5/29/00]). Fox News suggests they might be using this position to impede the 9/11 investigation. [Fox News, 12/12/01] December 16, 2001 Fox News removes its series on the "art student" spy ring (see December 12-15, 2001) from its website after only two days, in response to pressure from the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) and others. (see for instance, [CAMERA, 12/12/01, CAMERA, 12/13/01]). CAMERA for instance, suggests the reporter "has something, personally, about Israel... Maybe he's very sympathetic to the Arab side." [Salon, 5/7/02] The head of the ADL calls the report "sinister dangerous innuendo which fuels anti-Semitism." [Forward, 12/21/01] Yet there doesn't appear to be any substance to these personal attacks (and Forward later reverses its stance on the spy ring. [Forward, 3/15/02]). Fox News also never makes a formal repudiation or correction about the series. The contents of the series continues to be mostly ignored by the mainstream media, but it makes a big impact inside the US government. For instance, an internal DEA communiqué from December 18 mentions the Fox report by name, and warns of security breaches in telecommunications as described in the Fox report. [Salon, 5/7/02] March 5, 2002 It is reported that many spies in the uncovered Israeli spy ring seemed to have been trailing the 9/11 hijackers. For instance, five Israeli spies are intercepted in the tiny town of Hollywood, Florida, and four 9/11 hijackers are known to have spent time in Hollywood, Florida. [Le Monde, 3/5/02, Reuters, 3/5/02, Jane's Intelligence Digest, 3/15/02] In one case, some Israeli spies lived at 4220 Sheridan Street, only a few hundred feet from where Atta was living at 3389 Sheridan Street. Israeli spies appear to have been close to at least 10 of the 19 9/11 hijackers. [Salon, 5/7/02] March 6, 2002 A Washington Post article completely denies the existence of any Israeli spy ring. A "wide array of US officials" supposedly deny it, and Justice Department spokeswoman Susan Dryden says: "This seems to be an urban myth that has been circulating for months. The department has no information at this time to substantiate these widespread reports about Israeli art students involved in espionage." [Washington Post, 3/6/02] The New York Times fails to cover the story at all, even months later. [Salon, 5/7/02] By mid-March, Jane's, the respected British intelligence and military analysis service, notes: "It is rather strange that the US media seems to be ignoring what may well be the most explosive story since the 11 September attacks - the alleged breakup of a major Israeli espionage operation in the USA." [Jane's Intelligence Digest, 3/13/02] March 11, 2002 A newspaper reports that the DEA study on Israeli "art students" determined the "students" all had "recently served in the Israeli military, the majority in intelligence, electronic signal intercept or explosive ordnance units." [Palm Beach Post, 3/11/02] March 15, 2002 Forward, a US publication with a large Jewish audience, admits that there has been an Israeli spy ring in the US. This is a reversal of their earlier stance. (see [Forward, 12/21/01]) But, "far from pointing to Israeli spying against US government and military facilities, as reported in Europe last week, the incidents in question appear to represent a case of Israelis in the United States spying on a common enemy, radical Islamic networks suspected of links to Middle East terrorism." [Forward, 3/15/02] May 7, 2002 In the middle of the night a moving truck is pulled over for speeding in Oak Harbor, Washington, near the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. The base is the home of the advanced electronic warfare Prowler jets. A bomb-sniffing dog detects explosives on one of the men and inside the truck. High-tech equipment is then later used to confirm the presence of TNT on the gearshift and RDX plastic explosive on the steering wheel. Both men turn out to be Israeli (one with an altered passport), and in the country illegally. [Fox News, 5/13/02] However, later the FBI clears the two men, saying both the dog and the tests just detected false positives from "residue left by a cigarette lighter." [Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 5/14/02, Jerusalem Post, 5/14/02] The "art student spy ring" frequently uses moving vans as cover, and has been caught spying on the most top secret military bases. [Salon, 5/7/02] In a possibly related story, the Seattle FBI office that handled this case appears to have been broken into a few weeks later, and even a room containing evidence was penetrated. [Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 7/29/02] Does it not appear that the spy ring is still active, and the FBI is covering up for them and releasing them, no matter what they're caught doing? Why? May 7, 2002 (B) Salon reports on the Israeli "art student" ring. All the "students" claim to have come from either Bezalel Academy, or the University of Jerusalem. A look in the Bezalel database shows that not a single one of them appear to have attended school there. There is no such thing as the University of Jerusalem. In fact, the article points out that the sheer sloppiness and brazenness of the spy operation appears to be a great mystery, especially since the Mossad is renowned as one of the best spy agencies in the world. One government source suggests a theory to Salon that the "art students" were actually a smoke screen. They were meant to be caught and connected to DEA surveillance so that a smaller number of spies also posing as art students could complete other missions. One such mission could have been the monitoring of al-Qaeda terrorists. [Salon, 5/7/02] Shortly afterwards, a major Israeli newspaper publishes a story about the spy ring, but doesn't come to any conclusions. [Ha'aretz, 5/14/02] Could it be that Israel assisted the US in keeping an eye on the terrorists, thus allowing the US to maintain plausible deniability and a detachment if there were investigations on what the US knew? November 2002 Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef blames Zionists and Jews for the 9/11 attacks. He tells journalists, "Who has benefited from Sept. 11 attacks? I think [the Jews] were the protagonists of such attacks." Nayef is in charge of the Saudi investigation into the attacks, and some US congress-people respond to the comments by questioning how strongly Saudi Arabia is investigating the involvement of the 15 Saudi 9/11 hijackers.

Terrorists Ahmad Ajaj and Ramzi Yousef enter the US together. Ajaj is arrested at Kennedy Airport in New York City. Ramzi Yousef is not arrested, and later masterminds the 1993 bombing of the WTC (see February 26, 1993).
"The US government was pretty sure Ahmad Ajaj was a terrorist from the moment he stepped foot on US soil," because his "suitcases were stuffed with fake passports, fake IDs and a cheat sheet on how to lie to US immigration inspectors," plus "two handwritten notebooks filled with bomb recipes, six bomb-making manuals, four how-to videotapes concerning weaponry and an advanced guide to surveillance training."
However, Ajaj is only charged with passport fraud, and serves a six-month sentence. From prison, Ajaj frequently calls Ramzi Yousef and others in the WTC bombing plot, but no one monitors or translates the calls until long after the bombing.
[Los Angeles Times, 10/14/01]
An Israeli newsweekly later reports that the Palestinian Ajaj may have been a mole for the Israeli Mossad. The Village Voice has suggested that Ajaj may have had "advance knowledge of the World Trade Center bombing, which he shared with Mossad, and that Mossad, for whatever reason, kept the secret to itself." Ajaj was not just knowledgeable, but was involved in the planning of the bombing from his prison cell.
[Village Voice, 8/3/93]
Ajaj is released from prison three days after the WTC bombing, but is later rearrested and sentenced to more than 100 years in prison.
One of the manuals seized from Ajaj is horribly mistranslated for the trial. For instance, the title page is said to say "The Basic Rule," published in 1982, when in fact the title says "Al-Qaeda" (which means "the base" in English), published in 1989. Investigators later complain that a proper translation could have shown an early connection between al-Qaeda and the WTC bombing.
[New York Times, 1/14/01]
February 26, 1993
An attempt to blow up the WTC fails. Six people are killed in the misfired blast. Analysts later determine that had the terrorists not made a minor error in the placement of the bomb, both towers could have fallen and up to 50,000 people could have been killed. The attempt is organized by Ramzi Yousef, who has close ties to bin Laden.
[Congressional Hearings, 2/24/98]
The New York Times later reports on Emad Salem, an undercover agent who ends up being the key government witness in the trial against the bomber. Salem testifies that the FBI knew about the attack beforehand and told him they would thwart it by substituting a harmless powder for the explosives. However, this plan was called off by an FBI supervisor, and the bombing was not stopped.
[New York Times, 10/28/93]
Why did the FBI seemingly let the terrorists go ahead with the bombing? Others suspects are ineptly investigated before the bombing (see July 1990 and November 5, 1990). Several of the bombers were trained by the CIA to fight in the Afghan war, and the CIA later concludes in internal documents that it was "partly culpable" for this bombing attempt.
[Independent, 11/1/98]
Ahmad Ajaj, an associate of Yousef, may have been a mole for the Israeli Mossad, and the Mossad may have had advanced knowledge of the bombing (see September 1, 1992). US officials later state that the overall mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, is a close relative of Ramzi Yousef, [Independent, 6/6/02] probably his uncle.
[Los Angeles Times, 9/1/02]
One of the attackers even left a message found by investigators stating, "Next time, it will be very precise." 9/11 can be seen as a completion of this failed attack.
[AP, 9/30/01]
January 2000 (B)
A DEA government document later leaked to the press [DEA report, 6/01] suggests that a large Israeli spy ring starts penetrating the US from at least this time, if not earlier. This ring, which will later become popularly known as the "art student spy ring," is later shown to have strange connections to the events of 9/11.
[Insight, 3/11/02]
February 6, 2000
India's largest newsweekly reports that it appears a recent Mossad attempt to infiltrate al-Qaeda failed when they were stopped by Indian customs officials on their way to Bangladesh. These 11 men appeared to be from Afghanistan, but had Israeli passports.
One expert states,
"It is not unlikely for Mossad to recruit 11 Afghans in Iran and grant them Israeli citizenship to penetrate a network such as Bin Laden's. They would begin by infiltrating them into an Islamic radical group in an unlikely place like Bangladesh."
[The Week, 2/6/00]
If this shows that Mossad was trying to infiltrate al-Qaeda, did they make other attempts that succeeded, and if so, is this how they learned enough to know where to trail al-Qaeda in the US via the "art student spy ring"?
April 19, 2000
USA Today states that "Israeli crime groups... dominate distribution" of Ecstasy.
[USA Today, 4/19/00]
The DEA also states that most of the Ecstasy sold in the US is "controlled by organized crime figures in Western Europe, Russia and Israel."
[UPI, 10/25/01]
According to DEA documents, the Israeli "art student" spy ring" has been linked to several ongoing DEA [Ecstasy] investigations in Florida, California, Texas and New York now being closely coordinated by DEA headquarters."
In addition to 9/11 connections explored later, was this spy ring meant to obstruct DEA prosecution of Israeli organized crime?
December 2000-April 2001
According to later German reports,
"a whole horde of Israeli counter-terror investigators, posing as students, [follow] the trails of Arab terrorists and their cells in the United States... In the town of Hollywood, Florida, they [identify]... Atta and Marwan Alshehhi as possible terrorists. Agents [live] in the vicinity of the apartment of the two seemingly normal flight school students, observing them around the clock."
Supposedly, around April, the Israeli agents are discovered and deported, terminating the investigation.
[Der Spiegel, 10/1/02]
However, 80 additional agents are apprehended between June and December 2001 [Fox News, 12/12/01] and even more have been uncovered since (see May 7, 2002). Did the surveillance of Atta and others in fact end in April? Other reports have implied the story and connection (see March 5, 2002). Supposedly, the Mossad waits until late August 2001 before informing the CIA what it learns, and the CIA doesn't take the warning seriously (see August 23, 2001).
January 21, 2001
George Bush Jr. is inaugurated as the 43rd US President, replacing Clinton. The only major figure to permanently remain in office is CIA Director Tenet, appointed in 1997 and reputedly a long time friend of Bush Sr. FBI Director Louis Freeh stays on until June 2001.
March 23, 2001
The Office of National Drug Control Policy issues a National Security Alert describing "apparent attempts by Israeli nationals to learn about government personnel and office layouts." This later comes to light through a leaked Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) document called "Suspicious Activities Involving Israeli Art Students at DEA Facilities." A crackdown ensues and by June around 120 Israelis are apprehended. More are apprehended later.
[Read the document here: DEA report, 6/01]
June 2001 (G)
A 60-page internal memo on the Israeli "art student" spy ring is prepared by the DEA's Office of Security Programs.
[Read the memo here: DEA report, 6/01]
The memo is a compilation of dozens of field reports, and was meant only for the eyes of senior officials at the Justice Department (of which the DEA is adjunct), but it is leaked to the press around December 2001. The report connects the spies to efforts to foil investigations into Israeli organized crime activity involving the importation of the drug Ecstasy.
The spies also appear to be snooping on top secret military bases. For instance, on April 30, 2001, an Air Force alert was issued from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City concerning "possible intelligence collection being conducted by Israeli Art Students." Tinker AFB houses AWACS surveillance craft and Stealth bombers. By the time of the report, the US has "apprehended or expelled close to 120 Israeli nationals" but many remain at large.
[Le Monde, 3/5/02, Salon, 5/7/02]
An additional 20 or so Israeli spies are apprehended between June and 9/11.
[Fox News, 12/12/01]
August 8-15, 2001
At some point between these dates, Israel warns the US that an al-Qaeda attack is imminent.
[Fox News, 5/17/02]
Two high ranking agents from the Mossad come to Washington and warn the FBI and CIA that from 50 to 200 terrorists have slipped into the US and are planning "a major assault on the United States." They say indications point to a "large scale target", and that Americans would be "very vulnerable." They add there could be Iraqi connections to the al-Qaeda attack.
[Telegraph, 9/16/01, Los Angeles Times, 9/20/01, Ottawa Citizen, 9/17/01]
The Los Angeles Times later retracts the story after a CIA spokesman says, "There was no such warning. Allegations that there was are complete and utter nonsense."
[Los Angeles Times, 9/21/01]
In light of later revelations of a Mossad spy ring trailing numerous Muslim terrorists in the US, it is easy to see that Mossad would have known this info. Could this be later disinformation by the Mossad to spin the spy ring story and blame Iraq for 9/11, or it is another smoking gun showing extensive US foreknowledge?
August 23, 2001
According to German newspapers, the Mossad gives the CIA a list of terrorists living in the US and say that they appear to be planning to carry out an attack in the near future. It is unknown if these are the 19 9/11 hijackers or if the number is a coincidence. However, four names on the list are known and are names of the 9/11 hijackers: Nawaf Alhazmi, Khalid Almihdhar, Marwan Alshehhi, and Mohamed Atta.
[Die Zeit, 10/1/02, Der Spiegel, 10/1/02, BBC, 10/2/02, Haaretz, 10/3/02]
The Mossad appears to have learned about this through its "art student" spy ring (see for instance, March 5, 2002). Yet apparently this warning and list are not treated as particularly urgent by the CIA and also not passed on to the FBI. It's not clear if this warning influenced the adding of Alhazmi and Almihdhar to a terrorism watch list on this same day, and if so, why only those two.
Israel has denied that there were any Mossad agents in the US. [Haaretz, 10/3/02] The US has denied knowing about Atta before 9/11, despite other media reports to the contrary (see January-May 2000).
September 4, 2001 (D)
Zim-American Israeli Shipping Co. moves their North American headquarters from the 16th floor of the WTC to Norfolk, Virginia, one week before the 9/11 attacks. The Israeli government owns 49 percent of the company. [Virginian-Pilot, 9/4/01] Zim announced the move and its date six months earlier.
[Virginian- Pilot, 4/3/01]
More than 200 workers had just been moved out; about 10 are still in the building making final moving arrangements on 9/11, but escape alive. [Jerusalem Post, 9/13/01, Journal of Commerce, 10/18/01] The move leaves only one Israeli company, ClearForest, with 18 employees, in the WTC on 9/11. The four or five employees in the building at the time manage to escape.
[Jerusalem Post, 9/13/01]
One year later, a Zim ship is impounded attempting to ship Israeli military equipment to Iran; it is speculated that this is done with the knowledge of Israel.
[AFP, 8/29/02 (B)]
Given the Israeli government ties, the Odigo warning (see September 11, 2001 (C)), and the Israeli art student spy ring (see December 2000-April 2001), some have speculated that the move was more than just lucky.
September 10, 2001 (B)
An Army School of Advanced Military Studies issues a report written by elite US army officers, which is made public just prior to 9/11. The report gives the following description for the Mossad: "Wildcard. Ruthless and cunning. Has capability to target US forces and make it look like a Palestinian/ Arab act."
[Washington Times, 9/10/01]
After 9/11 and revelations of a large Mossad spy ring operating mysteriously in the US, some suggest that the Mossad did in fact do just that on 9/11.
September 11, 2001 (C)
Two employees of Odigo, Inc., in Israel, receive warnings of an imminent attack in New York City around two hours before the first plane hits the WTC. Odigo, one of the world's largest instant messaging companies, has its headquarters two blocks from the WTC. The Odigo Research and Development offices where the warnings were received are located in Herzliyya, a suburb of Tel Aviv.
Israeli security and the FBI were notified immediately after the 9/11 attacks began. The two employees claim not to know who sent the warnings. "Odigo service includes a feature called People Finder that allows users to seek out and contact others based on certain interests or demographics.
[Alex] Diamandis [Odigo vice president of sales and marketing] said it was possible that the attack warning was broadcast to other Odigo members, but the company has not received reports of other recipients of the message."
[Ha'aretz, 9/26/01, Washington Post, 9/27/01 (C)]
FTW Odigo claims the warning did not specifically mention the WTC, but the company won't say what was specified, claiming, "Providing more details would only lead to more conjecture."
[Washington Post, 9/28/01]
Odigo gave the FBI the internet address of the message's sender so the name of the sender could be found.
[Deutsche Presse-Agentur, 9/26/01]
Two months later it is reported that the FBI is still investigating the matter, but there have been no reports since.
[Courier Mail, 11/20/01]
Could the message have been a mass e-mail sent to a large group? Could this be related to the "art student spy ring"? Did the original senders directly inform the FBI as well, and if not, why not?
September 11, 2001 (G)
The 9/11 attack: four planes are hijacked, two crash into the WTC, one into the Pentagon, and one crashes into the Pennsylvania countryside. At least 3,000 people are killed. A more detailed timeline focusing on the hours of this attack appears on a separate page.
September 11, 2001 (W)
Five Israelis are arrested for "puzzling behavior" related to the WTC attacks. They are arrested around 4:30 P.M. after having filmed the burning WTC from the roof of their company's building near Liberty State Park, then shouting in what was interpreted as cries of joy and mockery. They were spotted by a neighbor who called the police and the FBI. The police tracked them down in a van with the words "Urban Moving Systems" written on the side.
[Bergen Record, 9/12/01, Ha'aretz, 9/17/01]
One man was found with $4,700 in cash hidden in his sock, another had two passports on him, and a box cutter was found in the van.
[ABC News, 6/21/02]
Investigators say that "There are maps of the city in the car with certain places highlighted... It looked like they're hooked in with this. It looked like they knew what was going to happen."
[Bergen Record, 9/12/01]
One of these Israelis later says, "Our purpose was to document the event."
The FBI later concludes at least two are Mossad agents and that all were on a Mossad surveillance mission. The FBI interrogates them for weeks.
[Forward, 3/15/02]
They are held on immigration violation charges and released 71 days later.
Their names are later identified as Sivan and Paul Kurzberg, Oded Ellner, Omer Marmari and Yaron Shmuel.
September 11 , 2001 (X)
An FAA memo written on the evening of 9/11 suggests a man on Flight 11 was shot and killed by a gun before the plane crashed into the WTC.
[See the leaked FAA memo, originally posted at World Net Daily]
The "Executive Summary," based on information relayed by a flight attendant to the American Airlines Operation Center, stated "that a passenger located in seat 10B shot and killed a passenger in seat 9B at 9:20 A.M.
[since Flight 11 crashed at 8:46, the time must be a typo, probably meaning 8:20].
The passenger killed was Daniel Lewin, shot by passenger Satam Al Suqami." The FAA claims that the document is a "first draft" and declines to release the final draft, calling it "protected information." A report in Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz on September 17 identifies Lewin as a former member of the Israel Defense Force Sayeret Matkal, Israel's most successful special-operations unit.
[UPI, 3/6/02].
Sayeret Matkal is a deep-penetration unit that has been involved in assassinations, the theft of foreign signals- intelligence materials, and the theft and destruction of foreign nuclear weaponry. Sayeret Matkal is best known for the 1976 rescue of 106 passengers at Entebbe Airport in Uganda.
[New Yorker, 10/29/01]
Officials later deny the gun story and suggest that Lewin was probably stabbed to death instead (which would still be very interesting).
[UPI, 3/6/02, Washington Post, 3/2/02]
Note that Lewin founded Akamai, a successful computer company, and his connections to Sayeret Mat'kal remained hidden until the gun story came to light.
[Guardian, 9/15/01]
Perhaps Lewin just happened to be there, and, with his past training, tried to be a hero and stop the hijack? What are the odds that an Israeli counter-terrorist expert would not only be on this hijacked flight, but also have terrorists sitting in the seats directly in front and behind him?
September 11, 2001 (BB)
Former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, when asked what the 9/11 attacks mean for relations between the US and Israel, replies, "It's very good." Then he edited himself: "Well, not very good, but it will generate immediate sympathy."
[New York Times, 9/12/01]
A week later, the Village Voice states, "From national networks to small-town newspapers, the view that America's terrible taste of terrorism will finally do away with even modest calls for the restraint of Israel's military attacks on Palestinian towns has become an instant, unshakable axiom.... Now, support for Israel in America is officially absolute, and Palestinians are cast once again as players in a global terrorist conspiracy."

According to Seymour Hersh of the New Yorker, a few days after 9/11 members of the elite Israeli counter- terrorism unit Sayeret Matkal arrive in the US and begin training with US Special Forces in a secret location. The two groups are developing contingency plans to attack Pakistan's military bases and remove its nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government or the nuclear weapons fall into the wrong hands.
There may have been threats to enact this plan on September 13, 2001 (see September 11-16, 2001). The Japan Times later notes that this "threat to divest Pakistan of its 'crown jewels' was cleverly used by the US, first to force Musharraf to support its military campaign in Afghanistan, and then to warn would-be coup plotters against Musharraf."
[Japan Times, 11/10/01]
Note the curious connection between Sayeret Matkal and one of the 9/11 passengers on Flight 11 (see September 11, 2001 (X)).

Dominick Suter, owner of the company Urban Moving Systems, flees the country to Israel. The FBI later tells ABC News that "Urban Moving may have been providing cover for an Israeli intelligence operation." Suter has been tied to the five Israeli agents caught filming the WTC attack. The FBI had questioned him around September 12, removing boxes of documents and a dozen computer hard drives. But when they returned a few days later, Suter is gone (see September 11, 2001 (W)).

Police in the Midwest stop six men carrying suspicious documents. They possess photos and descriptions of a nuclear power plant in Florida and the Trans-Alaska pipeline, and also have "box cutters and other equipment." All six have Israeli passports. They are let released the same day after their passports are shown to be valid, but before anyone interviews them. The FBI is reportedly furious about their release.
[Miami Herald, 10/3/01, Knight Ridder, 10/31/01, London Times, 11/2/01]
The six men may have been Mossad agents. In addition to snooping on the DEA and Muslim terrorists, some Mossad agents in the "art student" spy ring have been caught trying to break into military bases and other top secret facilities.
[Salon, 5/7/02]
Perhaps they were gathering information, not planning a hijack?

Two men, Moshe Elmakias and Ron Katar, are arrested after being found with a detailed video of the Sears Tower in Chicago. In addition, a woman named Ayelet Reisler is found with them, carrying conflicting identification information. They are arrested for illegal dumping, using a van with the name Moving Systems Incorporated. The video contains extensive zoom in shots of the Sears Tower; it is not known when the video was filmed.
[Philadelphia Mercury, 10/18/01]
Given the moving van cover (see September 11, 2001 (W) and [DEA report, 6/01]), and the Jewish names, it is likely these three are part of the Israeli spy ring. Could they have been videotaping the Sears Tower on 9/11 in the expectation that it would be hit by a plane? Had Flight 93 not been delayed 40 minutes on the runway and stayed on course, it would have been near Chicago at the same time as the other attacks, and it turned towards Washington 20 minutes after the FAA informed the military that the plane had been hijacked.
November 20, 2001
The five Israelis arrested on 9/11 for videotaping the WTC attack and then cheering about it (see September 11, 2001 (W)) are released and return to Israel. Some of the men's names appeared in a US national intelligence database, and the FBI concluded that at least two of the men were working for the Mossad, according to ABC News.
But the FBI says that none of them had any advanced knowledge of the 9/11 attacks, and they were released as part of a deal between the US and the Israel government. After their release they claim to have been tortured.

The Washington Post reports, "At least 60 young Israeli Jews have been arrested and detained around the country on immigration charges since the Sept. 11 attacks, many of them held on US government officials' invocation of national security." An INS official who requested anonymity says the use of the term "special interest" for Israelis being held in Cleveland, St. Louis and other places means the case in question is "related to the investigation of September 11th." [Washington Post, 11/23/01] Could this be more "art school" spy ring activity?
December 12-15, 2001
Fox News broadcasts a remarkable series about the Israeli "art student" spy ring. The report mentions that at least 60 more Israelis have been detained or arrested since 9/11.
"There is no indication that the Israelis were involved in the 9/11 attacks, but investigators suspect that the Israelis may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance, and not shared it."
When a government source is asked if the Israeli spies knew about the 9/11 attacks before they happened, he responds,
"The principal question is 'how could they have not known?'" "Investigators within the DEA, INS and FBI have all told Fox News that to pursue or even suggest Israeli spying... is considered career suicide."
"The principal question is 'how could they have not known?'"
"Investigators within the DEA, INS and FBI have all told Fox News that to pursue or even suggest Israeli spying... is considered career suicide."
A highly placed investigator says there are 'tie- ins' between the spy ring and 9/11. But when asked for details, he flatly refuses to describe them, saying,
"evidence linking these Israelis to 9-11 is classified. I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered. It's classified information."
The report also reveals that Amdocs, an Israeli company, is recording virtually every phone call in the US and could be passing information on to the Israeli government (similar claims were first raised in 2000 [Insight, 5/29/00]). Fox News suggests they might be using this position to impede the 9/11 investigation.
December 16, 2001
Fox News removes its series on the "art student" spy ring (see December 12-15, 2001) from its website after only two days, in response to pressure from the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) and others.
(see for instance, [CAMERA, 12/12/01, CAMERA, 12/13/01]).
CAMERA for instance, suggests the reporter "has something, personally, about Israel... Maybe he's very sympathetic to the Arab side."
The head of the ADL calls the report "sinister dangerous innuendo which fuels anti-Semitism."
[Forward, 12/21/01]
Yet there doesn't appear to be any substance to these personal attacks (and Forward later reverses its stance on the spy ring.
[Forward, 3/15/02]).
Fox News also never makes a formal repudiation or correction about the series. The contents of the series continues to be mostly ignored by the mainstream media, but it makes a big impact inside the US government. For instance, an internal DEA communiqué from December 18 mentions the Fox report by name, and warns of security breaches in telecommunications as described in the Fox report.

It is reported that many spies in the uncovered Israeli spy ring seemed to have been trailing the 9/11 hijackers. For instance, five Israeli spies are intercepted in the tiny town of Hollywood, Florida, and four 9/11 hijackers are known to have spent time in Hollywood, Florida.
[Le Monde, 3/5/02, Reuters, 3/5/02, Jane's Intelligence Digest, 3/15/02]
In one case, some Israeli spies lived at 4220 Sheridan Street, only a few hundred feet from where Atta was living at 3389 Sheridan Street. Israeli spies appear to have been close to at least 10 of the 19 9/11 hijackers.
March 6, 2002
A Washington Post article completely denies the existence of any Israeli spy ring. A "wide array of US officials" supposedly deny it, and Justice Department spokeswoman Susan Dryden says: "This seems to be an urban myth that has been circulating for months. The department has no information at this time to substantiate these widespread reports about Israeli art students involved in espionage."
[Washington Post, 3/6/02]
The New York Times fails to cover the story at all, even months later.
By mid-March, Jane's, the respected British intelligence and military analysis service, notes: "It is rather strange that the US media seems to be ignoring what may well be the most explosive story since the 11 September attacks - the alleged breakup of a major Israeli espionage operation in the USA."

Forward, a US publication with a large Jewish audience, admits that there has been an Israeli spy ring in the US. This is a reversal of their earlier stance.
(see [Forward, 12/21/01])
But, "far from pointing to Israeli spying against US government and military facilities, as reported in Europe last week, the incidents in question appear to represent a case of Israelis in the United States spying on a common enemy, radical Islamic networks suspected of links to Middle East terrorism."

In the middle of the night a moving truck is pulled over for speeding in Oak Harbor, Washington, near the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. The base is the home of the advanced electronic warfare Prowler jets. A bomb-sniffing dog detects explosives on one of the men and inside the truck. High-tech equipment is then later used to confirm the presence of TNT on the gearshift and RDX plastic explosive on the steering wheel. Both men turn out to be Israeli (one with an altered passport), and in the country illegally.
[Fox News, 5/13/02]
However, later the FBI clears the two men, saying both the dog and the tests just detected false positives from "residue left by a cigarette lighter."

The "art student spy ring" frequently uses moving vans as cover, and has been caught spying on the most top secret military bases.
In a possibly related story, the Seattle FBI office that handled this case appears to have been broken into a few weeks later, and even a room containing evidence was penetrated.
[Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 7/29/02]
Does it not appear that the spy ring is still active, and the FBI is covering up for them and releasing them, no matter what they're caught doing? Why?

Salon reports on the Israeli "art student" ring. All the "students" claim to have come from either Bezalel Academy, or the University of Jerusalem. A look in the Bezalel database shows that not a single one of them appear to have attended school there. There is no such thing as the University of Jerusalem.
In fact, the article points out that the sheer sloppiness and brazenness of the spy operation appears to be a great mystery, especially since the Mossad is renowned as one of the best spy agencies in the world. One government source suggests a theory to Salon that the "art students" were actually a smoke screen.
They were meant to be caught and connected to DEA surveillance so that a smaller number of spies also posing as art students could complete other missions. One such mission could have been the monitoring of al-Qaeda terrorists.
Shortly afterwards, a major Israeli newspaper publishes a story about the spy ring, but doesn't come to any conclusions.
[Ha'aretz, 5/14/02]

Indications of Israeli Involvement on 9/11 posted by Kevin Barrett, Part III From: Dick Eastman Sent: Monday, July 14, 2008 1:20 AM Subject: JEWS DID 9-11 - NOW YOU CAN BE SURE - Air Traffic Controller Pete Zalewski was responsible for both New York Tower crashes - and also was controller for Egypt 990 crash in 1999 Israel Defense Force Sayeret Matkal Branch - Sayeret Matkal is a deep-penetration unit that has been involved in assassinations, the theft of foreign (US) defense, financial, industrial and diplomatic secrets and the theft and destruction of foreign weapons and research facilities. They did 9-11. Air Traffic Controller Pete Zalewski was responsible for both New York Tower crashes - and also was controller for Egypt 990 crash in 1999, a plane loaded with the highest Egyptian military brass (see below) They were tough enough, bold enough, ruthless enough, and Jewish- supremacist-racist enough to do 9-11 and lie to our faces and mock us for suspecting them ever since. They are tough enough to destroy our economy and end our threat as a source of law and justice which they are doing very successfully right now. They are determined to finish us off before we can take in the facts and develop an organized response. But don't mind me - you just go on attending those Ron Paul, Bob Barr and Barrack Obama rallies - after all it doesn't matter whether Moslems or Jews did 9-11does it, so why should you care, right? TAfter all crime is not Jews doing 9-11, the crime in this country today is daring to point out what they have done. Ain't that right? Well forgive me, but you have to know. Wake up, damn it, and see who has you by the throat. Dick Eastman Yakima, Washington Air Traffic Controller Pete Zalewski was responsible for both New York Tower crashes - and also was controller for Egypt 990 crash in 1999 911 False Flag From this video: At 8:13 Pete Zalewski sees the information on his radar screen that the transponder is no longer transmitting, that the pilot of American Airlines flight 11 is no longer responding and that the flight route has been changed.Instead of immediately sounding the alarm we hear that he attempted repeatedly to contact the aircraft. From 8:13 to 8:24 a.m., this Pete Zalewski supposedly called the captain of AA11, "Hello.. please respond," as opposed to the necessity of securing the airspace he has nothing better to do than try to restore contact. No! I cannot believe that. That cannot be true. If I were the head of an air traffic control center, I would replace the person when I ascertained, that an aircraft that he was responsible for just disappeared into the World Trade Center. He was also responsible for the second aircraft, United Airlines flight 175. The most interesting thing yet, which has been reported by another air traffic controller, is that he was responsible for a third plane - Egypt Airlines flight 990, two years prior, that was packed to the brim with Egyptian military officials of the highest rank. It executed a strange maneuver near the coast then sank into the Atlantic...... After watching this video listen to the details how the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that EgyptAir 990 was taken over by remote control in the early hours of Oct. 31, 1999. I was interviewed by Giuliani here in 2006 but also by Tom Valentine's program where I was interviewed along with Chris Bollyn. I had no idea until seeing the above German clip that the same JEWISH air traffic controller happened to be assigned to be ATC for Egypt Air and both WTC tower planes. Charles Giuliani talking with Dick Eastman about 9-11 research "Remote-Control Crash-Bombings" by Dick Eastman 16 July 2008 Add to this the news stories of the 94 Israelis at Reagan and Dulles airports, each with illegal top security passes at the time of 9-11 - and each quietly deported by Attorney General Ashcroft a few months after the attack. - Dick Eastman Also: "Chris Bollyn has established that there is a connection between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Menachem Atzmon, the man who oversaw passenger screening and airport security at Boston's Logan Airport on 9/11 - Olmert and Atzmon are truly very close political allies and co-defendants in old Likud crimes.""...there is the very bizarre and suspicious Israeli link to the security of U.S. military computers that goes back to the early 1990s. (Remember the reports of Ptech and MITRE engaged in the basement of the FAA before 9/11?)... One must also keep in mind that 9/11 was primarily a computer crime, just like the stealing of our elections. Long before 9/11, a germ was planted in the U.S. defense computer system which allowed for a "super-user" to control the network and create the miscommunications that prevented the U.S. military from defending New York and Washington on that terrible day."As I have written earlier, the members of the YORAN family from Israel are among the key suspects, along with Michael Chertoff and others. I consider the YORANS to be high-ranking Israeli moles who infiltrated the most sensitive computer networks in the U.S. government and military - Zionest agents who facilitated the terror attacks of 9/11."The YORAN family includes, Dr. Chaim Yoran (a.k.a. Elad Yoran), his wife Ruth Lubelski Yoran, and their three sons: Amit Y. Yoran, Dov Yoran, and Naftali Elad Yoran."...The Yoran sons, Amit and Naftali Elad, are graduates of Westpoint. From this U.S.-based launching pad they went on to take over computer security for Dept. of Defense computer networks." For example, Forbes Magazine, in December 2001, wrote this about Amit Yoran: "Yoran, 32, earned degrees in computer science from West Point and George Washington University before joining the U.S. Air Force (?), where he took a job overseeing the emergency response team at the Defense Information Systems Agency ( ??). DSIA runs all military networks (!!!)." Chamish: "Menachem Atzmon... was Likud Treasurer along with Olmert in the late 80s," I answered. Then he playfully announced, "Did you know he was personally responsible for security at Logan and Newark Airports on 9/11?" That I DIDN'T know. Here is Bollyn's report: OLMERT AND ATZMON Olmert, who has long been tarnished by allegations of financial crimes, was implicated in a financial scandal involving forged receipts for donations to the 1988 Likud campaign, of which he was co-treasurer. This affair culminated in the March 1996 conviction of three other Likudniks, including Menahem Atzmon, the Likud treasurer. Olmert was also later indicted in the Likud affair, but was acquitted.During the 1970s Olmert had worked in the law firm owned by another Atzmon, Uzi Atzmon.Menahem Atzmon, convicted in Israel, went on to become the founder and head of International Consultants on Targeted Security (ICTS), the parent company of Huntleigh USA, the airport security firm that ran passenger screening operations at the airports of Boston and Newark on 9/11.Huntleigh USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of an Israeli company called International Consultants on Targeted Security (ICTS) International N.V., a Netherlands-based aviation and transportation security firm headed by "former [Israeli] military commanding officers and veterans of government intelligence and security agencies."Menachem Atzmon, convicted in Israel in 1996 for campaign finance fraud, and his business partner Ezra Harel, took over management of security at the Boston and Newark airports when their company ICTS bought Huntleigh USA in 1999. UAL Flight 175 and AA 11, which allegedly struck the twin towers, both originated in Boston, while UAL 93, which purportedly crashed in Pennsylvania, departed from the Newark airport.The convicted Israeli criminal Atzmon also controls and operates the German port of Rostock on the Baltic Sea.Some 9/11 victims' families brought lawsuits against Huntleigh claiming the security firm had been grossly negligent on 9-11. While these relatives have a right to discovery and to know what Huntleigh did or did not do to protect their loved ones on 9-11, Huntleigh, along with the other security companies, was granted complete congressional protection in 2002 and will not be called to account for its actions on 9-11 in any U.S. court.Atzmon, a convicted criminal, political ally and co-defendant of Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert, was directly responsible for passenger and airline security at Boston's Logan Airport....Menachem Atzmon resigned as president of Friedman's IDF following his 1996 conviction for Israeli election campaign finance fraud. But his later U.S. activities would prove to be much more disturbing.Atzmon and his business partner Ezra Harel are the majority owners (57%) of ICTS-International Consultants on Targeted Security, run by "former [Israeli] military commanding officers and veterans of government intelligence and security agencies" according its Web site. In 1999, Atzmon's Netherlands-based firm took over management of security at Logan Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, through ICTS' subsidiary Huntleigh USA.This convicted Likud criminal's firm was in charge of security at Logan Airport-inspecting the validity of passports and visas, searching cargo, screening passengers-when two airliners were hijacked from there on Sept. 11, 2001, and demolished the World Trade Center towers in New York.[...] 94 Israelis at Reagan and Dulles airports, each with illegal top security passes at the time of 9-11 - and each quietly deported by Attorney General Ashcroft a few months after the attack. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 100 employees at two major Washington-area airports have been arrested on fraud charges in obtaining restricted airport security badges, government sources said on Tuesday.The arrests will be announced by Attorney General John Ashcroft later in the day in Alexandria, Virginia, officials said.The arrests mark a continuing post Sept. 11 crackdown by U.S. law enforcement and transportation authorities on airport security lapses. Many of the charges - including those being brought against workers at Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport outside the capital involve allegations that suspects violated immigration and Social Security laws.Also, the government alleges that many arrested on Tuesday in the greater Washington area lied about criminal records while applying for security badges, the sources said.It was unclear initially what jobs those employees performed. As of last week, more than 250 people had been arrested at 11 U.S. airports on charges they fraudulently obtained credentials for access to sensitive airport areas like ramps, gates and aircraft.Roughly half have pleaded guilty or have plea arguments pending, authorities said. More than 70 have been deported or are awaiting deportation proceedings, 94 foreigners in the country illegally with top-security badges were at Dulles and Reagan airports on 9/11/01 From "Zacheim - Following Zakheim and Pentagon trillions to Israel and 9-11" July 31, 2006 Most people familiar with the 9/11 cover-up have a fair idea of some of the key players in the monumental 9/11 crime. Rabbi Dov Zakheim, one of the central figures in this vile operation, isn't as well known because he's one who has always lurked in the shadows. Zakheim is as powerful as he is inconspicuous, and a man of many talents: Graduate of the prestigious London School of Economics (PhD), and the University of Oxford (National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow) Former CEO of Systems Planning Corporation, a highly specialized defense technology company that manufactures a one-of-a-kind remote-piloting system for aircraft, including commercial airliners (see below) Senior Fellow for Asian Studies of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Member of the Task Force on Defense Reform (appointed by Secretary of Defense Cohen) Senior Advisor at the Center for International and Strategic Studies Former Under Secretary of Defense (appointed by George W.

Rumsfeld, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton, and Comptroller Dov Zakheim; on Monday, July 16, 2001./ [NB: Dr. Zakheim resigned as Pentagon Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer at the beginning of March when it was revealed that the he is unable to account for the disappearance of $2.6 trillion(its unlikely this will receive much coverage in the mainstream media). Zakheim has since taken a lucrative position as a vice president of the mega-consultancy Booz, Allen, & Hamilton (one that also works closely with DARPA). Rabbi Zakheim is also Chief Executive Officer of SPC International Corporation (a subsidiary of the aforementioned remote-flight-control-technology firm), a company that specializes in political, military, and economic consulting, and international sales and analysis. In addition, Dr. Zakheim serves as Consultant to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. As the Rabbis record clearly shows, he has serious tenure in the US defense establishment: more than 30 years of holding assorted senior positions at the Pentagon.] [2] Dov Zakheim is the co-author of that singularly sinister-and chillingly ominous-statement contained in Rearming Americas Defenses (RAD) re the plan for American global domination [through galvanizing American emotional support for full-scale war against oil-rich Arab states]: ...the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, /absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event-like a new Pearl Harbor/. The PNAC document also expressly recommends the US should seize Iraq /even if Saddam Hussein were deposed through a military coup/. [So much for bringing freedom and democracy to the people of that country.] The good Rabbis involvement with PNAC, his previous directorship of a corporation that manufactures remote control flight systems, and his inability to document how the Pentagon has spent TRILLIONS of American taxpayers dollars suggests that real investigations into the crimes of 9/11 and the US invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq would put Mr. Zakheim near the top of the witness list for interrogation and potential prosecution. SYSTEMS PLANNING CORPORATION Dr. Dov Zakheim was the former CEO of Systems Planning Corporation, a company that designs and manufactures extremely sophisticated control/guidance technology that enables an external operator to fly, and land, aircraft by remote control. One of the company's principal products is the Command Transmitter System (CTS), a fully redundant, self-contained, solid-state platform capable of providing totally programmable remote flight control capability, including high- precision electronic navigation. The company's parallel product, the Flight Termination System (FTS), enables system-equipped aircraft to be safely landed on any suitable runway in the world-regardless of the availability of ground-based navigational or landing aids (VOR, ILS, MLS, etc.). Such total independence in all flight regimes is achieved through a variety of ultra-sophisticated space-based technologies, including Mil-spec DGPS (Differential GPS, using extremely precise encrypted military "P" Code transmissions), and is accurate to within /one foot/ of the runway centerline during landing. * The CTS/FTS remote-control system is capable of controlling up to 8 airborne vehicles-including airliners-simultaneously from ground-based or airborne (AWACS) positions. * ["Coincidence": Operation Vigilant Guardian, one of five NORAD "war game exercises" underway on the morning of 9/11 and orchestrated byDick Cheney, involved the *simulated hijacking of commercial airliners*. At one point during the exercises, while the four "real" hijacked aircraft were airborne, as many as TWENTY-TWO independent radar blips representing "hijacked" aircraft were simultaneously displayed on FAA radar screens along the Eastern seaboard. This, obviously, created total pandemonium. Air traffic controllers who had been advised beforehand by NORAD of the "simulated hijackings", began frantically calling NORAD to determine which of the twenty-two targets were "real" and which were "exercise." All indications are that whatever it was that happened to the four real "hijacked" airliners occurred during this purposefully orchestrated melee while the order was given for the US Air Force to "stand down".] The CTS/FTS system (subsequently improved, tested and implemented by Raytheon) allows specialist ground controllers to listen-in on cockpit conversations on the target aircraft, then take absolute control of its computerized flight control system by remote means and safely land the aircraft at any airport within range. In other words, this technology was designed to empower "law enforcement agencies" to hijack hijackers. [NB: The ground station technology for CTS/FTS was developed by Raytheon under an Air Force contract for the Joint Precision Approach and Landings System (JPALS) program. A government-industry team accomplished the first precision approach/auto-land by a civil aircraft using this system on August 25, 2001 at Holloman AFB, NM. 'A FedEx Express 727-200 aircraft demonstrated hundred percent system proficiency by executing six full auto-lands using the JPALS ground station'.] "HOME RUN" In partnership with Raytheon, System Planning Corporation also supplies CTS/FTS technology to commercial airplane manufacturers for installation in airliners (Boeing: confirmed; Airbus: undetermined, but highly probable given the consortium's connection to BAE, a US military contractor.) It has been reported that DARPA's codename for the CTS/FTS system was "Home Run". Former German Secretary of Defense Andreas Von Buelow may have alluded to foreknowledge of Home Run technology in an interview he gave the German daily "Tagesspiegel" on January 13th, 2002: "There is also the theory of one British flight engineer: according to this, the steering of the planes was perhaps taken out of the pilots' hands, from outside. The Americans had developed a method in the 1970s, whereby they could rescue hijacked planes by intervening into the computer piloting [automatic pilot system]. This theory says this technique was abused in this case [9/11]..." Upon deeper scrutiny this may not appear quite so much a "theory" as might first seem. It's been reported that the German national carrier Lufthansa, seriously concerned that one of its own aircraft might be "rescued" by the Americans without its authority, had every one of its Home Run-equipped Boeing aircraft stripped of the American flight control computers. It's reasonable to presume that Herr Von Buelow - the Secretary of Defense and Minister of Science and Technology at the time-would have known all about this mammoth but secretive task (how very clever-and discreet-of Von Buelow to "drop" the information into the middle of an interview about the 9/11 attacks). Lufthansa aircraft (and possibly others) are now effectively impervious to Home Run take-overs, but that is more than can be said for the American aircraft fleet. In order to make Home Run truly effective, it had to be completely integrated with all onboard systems, and this could only be accomplished with a new aircraft design, several of which were on the drawing boards at that time. Under cover of extreme secrecy, the multinationals and DARPA went ahead on this basis and built "back doors" into the new computerized flight control systems. There were two very obvious hard requirements at this stage: 1) a primary control channel for use in taking over the flight control system and flying the aircraft back to an airfield of choice, and 2) a covert audio channel for monitoring flight deck conversations. Once the primary channel was activated, all aircraft functions came under direct ground (or AWACS) control, permanently removing the hijackers and pilots from the control loop. It needs mention that this was not a system designed to "undermine" the authority of the flight crews, but rather, implemented as a "doomsday" device in the event the hijackers began to shoot passengers or crew members, possibly including the pilots. Based on the reasonable assumption that hijackers only carry a limited number of rounds of ammunition, and many modern airliners carry in excess of 300 passengers, Home Run was envisaged as a system that could be used to fly all the survivors to a friendly airport for a safe landing. System Activation Activating the primary Home Run channel is reportedly fairly straightforward. A transponder, as many readers know, is a combined radio transmitter and receiver which operates automatically-in the case of 9/11, relaying data between the four aircraft and air traffic controllers on the ground. The transmitted signals represent a unique "identity" for each aircraft, essential in crowded airspace to avoid midair collisions-and equally essential for Home Run controllers trying to lock onto the correct aircraft. Once the correct target aircraft is located by radar, the Home Run duplex data bus "piggy backs" the transponder channel and assumes direct control from the ground. This could explain why NONE of the four aircraft sent the special "I have been hijacked" transponder code (7500), despite 'multiple activation points' for this distress transmission on all four aircraft-and despite being flown by combat-hardened ex-fighter pilots. Because the transponder frequency had already been piggy-backed by Home Run, transmission of the special hijack code was rendered impossible. This was the first hard proof that the target aircraft had been hijacked electronically from the ground, rather than by Arab patsies toting box-cutters. The Home Run listening device on the flight deck utilizes the cockpit microphones that normally feed the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), one of two black boxes armored to withstand heavy impact and thereby later provide investigators significant clues to why the aircraft crashed. However, once plugged into Home Run, the CVRs are bypassed, and voice transmissions are no longer recorded on the 30minute continuous-loop recording tape. If Home Run is active for more than thirty minutes, there will therefore be no audible data on the Cockpit Voice Recorders. Crash investigators are said to have recovered the CVRs from the Pentagon and Pittsburg aircraft, and publicly confirmed that both are completely blank. The only possible reason for this is data capture by Home Run, providing the final hard proof that the attack aircraft were hijacked electronically from the ground, rather than by "Arab terrorists". Discussion It is not being suggested that remote circumvention and take-over of the four airliners' controls is definitely what happened on 9/11. But if this scenario seems improbable, one must necessarily consider the probability of four airliners being taken over simultaneously, casually flown around a large swath of the country for almost two hours under the vigilant eye of NORAD, and then used as missiles-all without a single fighter being scrambled to intercept any of them. Since this is what actually happened, we have no choice but to consider other "implausible" scenarios. And since the official scenario is itself an unsubstantiated-and truly farfetched-"conspiracy theory," other competing scenarios should also receive serious attention. The public's reluctance to question official doctrine on this matter is a symptom of the societal role for which most of us have been bred and trained: to be ever-faithful hounds, tails thumping the floor as we contentedly slurp the hand of class authority. Such credulity also becomes inevitable when the alternative is so unbearable: if someone in Bush's position is capable of lying to us about something as huge, as gut-wrenchingly horrible as 9/11, then everything we believe about this country-about the nature of civilization itself-might just be childish nonsense. Most people simply don't have the guts to go there. Given a desperate enough need to sustain the childish belief in government-as-benevolent-father, a person will adapt that belief to any circumstance. The behavioral end result can resemble courage; indeed, we are taught to regard it as the DEFINITION of courage. Actually, it's one of cowardice's darkest moments. Even a casual examination of Nazi Germany, where this phenomenon was rampant, will drive this point home. It's almost funny, the way people readily see the threat of technological circumvention presented by Diebold's electronic voting machines, yet when the subject switches to Systems Planning Corporation's Flight Termination System, which is every bit as real, and to the exactly parallel possibilities it represents vis-a-vis 9/11, they suddenly retreat into profound and combative denial. It's as if a threshold has been crossed into a realm of possibilities too vile to entertain, so they simply don't. Never mind that this country's operatives have been traveling the world, perpetrating similar horrors, for all of the past century. Rather than acknowledge the possibility of a unifying pattern, Joe Sixpack would much rather 'shoot the messenger.' Every so often, such people establish a new high-water mark for cowardice and facultative stupidity, and the present is definitely one of those times. After all, the official 9/11 scenario they cling to with such desperate faith comes from only one source: the Western "intelligence community"-the most brazen, systematic, resourceful, and interlocked association of habitual liars this world has ever seen. As should have been made clear by any number of intelligence scandals over the years, the credibility of this bunch goes past zero into the negative: pending airtight proof, anything they say should be reflexively deemed a lie. You may remember that the FBI also provided the identities of "the 19 hijackers" within hours-information that soon also became quite suspect, especially considering there was NOT ONE Arab name on any of the flight manifests (miraculously, they even found paper passports that had survived fireballs, Arabic flight manuals conveniently left in the trunks of cars, etc., etc.) At least seven of the hijackers are still alive in the Middle East-a pretty good alibi, wouldn't you say? Several of these ex-suspects had their passports or other IDs stolen from them over the years, and it's entirely possible that all 19 hijackers had stolen identities, meaning they could have come from anywhere-or been absent altogether. Our media were pretty slack about acknowledging this at the time, and since then have dropped this ball entirely. What's really amazing is that not one mainstream journalist has asked how these 19 alleged hijackers boarded their aircraft when their names were not on any of the passenger manifests. Rather than allow the "intelligence community" to render every detail of our comprehension on this matter, we would be much wiser to carefully identify and discard every assumption they hand us.

From: Dick Eastman To: Undisclosed-Recipient Sent: Thursday, May 29, 2008 11:50 PM Subject: Chertoff, Zakheim, Perle, Wolfowitz and a hundred others in high places have Dual US-Israeli Citizenship - where does their loyalty lie? (UK Telegraph blog) Dual Citizenship - where does the loyalty lie? UK Telegraph blog 17 May 2008 In this increasingly mobile world more and more people are acquiring dual citizenship. Usually it's simply their adopted country and their native country but in some cases, particularly in the USA, there is another motive for duality. Take a look at these people who currently or have recently held positions of great influence and power in the American administration and ask yourself where do their loyalties lie? Puzzling too is the fact that under US law if you take up the citizenship of another country you relinquish your US citizenship. So how do these people achieve the impossible? If you are a supporter of the Israeli state how do you feel about the USA being infiltrated and usurped by its friend 'ally'? Dual Citizenship - Loyal to Whom? (With all acknowledgements to Dan Eden who has produced a very comprehensive and revealing article) Michael Mukasey Recently appointed as US Attorney General. Mukasey also was the judge in the litigation between developer Larry Silverstein and several insurance companies arising from the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11/2001. Michael Chertoff Former Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, at the Justice Department; now head of Homeland Security. Richard Perle One of Bush's foreign policy advisors, he is the chairman of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board. A very likely Israeli government agent, Perle was expelled from Senator Henry Jackson's office in the 1970's after the National Security Agency (NSA) caught him passing Highly-Classified (National Security) documents to the Israeli Embassy. He later worked for the Israeli weapons firm, Soltam. Perle came from one the above mentioned pro-Israel thinktanks, the AEI. Perle is one of the leading pro-Israeli fanatics leading this Iraq war mongering within the administration and now in the media. Paul Wolfowitz Former Deputy Defense Secretary, and member of Perle's Defense Policy Board, in the Pentagon. Wolfowitz is a close associate of Perle, and reportedly has close ties to the Israeli military. His sister lives in Israel. Wolfowitz came from the above mentioned Jewish think-tank, JINSA. Wolfowitz was the number two leader within the administration behind this Iraq war mongering. He later was appointed head of the World Bank but resigned under pressure from World Bank members over a scandal involving his misuse of power. Lawrence (Larry) Franklin The former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst with expertise in Iranian policy issues who worked in the office of Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith and reported directly to Feith's deputy, William Luti, was sentenced January 20, 2006, "to more than 12 years in prison for giving classified information to an Israeli diplomat" and members of the pro-Israel lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Franklin will "remain free while the government continues with the wider case" and his "prison time could be sharply reduced in return for his help in prosecuting" former AIPAC members Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman, [who] are scheduled to go on trial in April [2006]. Franklin admitted that he met periodically with Rosen and Weissman between 2002 and 2004 and discussed classified information, including information about potential attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq. Rosen and Weissman would later share what they learned with reporters and Israeli officials." (source: sourcewatch.com). Douglas Feith Under Secretary of Defense and Policy Advisor at the Pentagon. He is a close associate of Perle and served as his Special Counsel. Like Perle and the others, Feith is a pro-Israel extremist, who has advocated anti-Arab policies in the past. He is closely associated with the extremist group, the Zionist Organization of America, which even attacks Jews that don't agree with its extremist views. Feith frequently speaks at ZOA conferences. Feith runs a small law firm, Feith and Zell, which only has one International office, in Israel. The majority of their legal work is representing Israeli interests. His firm's own website stated, prior to his appointment, that Feith "represents Israeli Armaments Manufacturer." Feith basically represents the Israeli War Machine. Feith also came from the Jewish thinktank JINSA. Feith, like Perle and Wolfowitz, are campaigning hard for this Israeli proxy war against Iraq. Feith was investigated by the FBI under suspicion of leaking classified information to Israel, being that he was Larry Franklin's boss when Franklin leaked those documents to Rosen and Weissman of AIPAC. For that he was forced to leave the National Security Council. Feith was also investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee for sexing up 'intelligence' that was used to justify invading Iraq. Edward Luttwak Member of the National Security Study Group of the Department of Defence at the Pentagon. Luttwak is reportedly an Israeli citizen and has taught in Israel. He frequently writes for Israeli and pro-Israeli newspapers and journals. Luttwak is an Israeli extremist whose main theme in many of his articles is the necessity of the U.S. waging war against Iraq and Iran. Henry Kissinger One of many Pentagon Advisors, Kissinger sits on the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board under Perle. For detailed information about Kissinger's evil past, read Seymour Hersch's book (Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House). Kissinger likely had a part in the Watergate crimes, Southeast Asia mass murders (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos), Installing Chilean mass murdering dictator Pinochet, Operation Condor's mass killings in South America, and more recently served as Serbia's Ex-Dictator Slobodan Milosevic's Advisor. He consistently advocated going to war against Iraq. Kissinger is the Ariel Sharon of the U.S. Unfortunately, President Bush nominated Kissinger as chairman of the September 11 investigating commission. It's like picking a bank robber to investigate a fraud scandal. He later declined this job under enormous protests. Dov Zakheim Dov Zakheim is an ordained rabbi and reportedly holds Israeli citizenship. Zakheim attended Jew's College in London and became an ordained Orthodox Jewish Rabbi in 1973. He was adjunct professor at New York's Jewish Yeshiva University. Zakheim is close to the Israeli lobby. Dov Zakheim is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and in 2000 a co-author of the Project for the New American Century's position paper, Rebuilding America's Defenses, advocating the necessity for a Pearl-Harbor-like incident to mobilize the country into war with its enemies, mostly Middle Eastern Muslim nations. He was appointed by Bush as Pentagon Comptroller from May 4, 2001 to March 10, 2004. At that time he was unable to explain the disappearance of $1 trillion dollars. Actually, nearly three years earlier, Donald Rumsfeld announced on September 10, 2001 that an audit discovered $2.3 trillion was also missing from the Pentagon books. That story, as mentioned, was buried under 9-11's rubble. The two sums disappeared on Zakheim's watch. We can only guess where that cash went. Despite these suspicions, on May 6, 2004, Zakheim took a lucrative position at Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the most prestigious strategy consulting firms in the world. One of its clients then was Blessed Relief, a charity said to be a front for Osama bin Laden. Booz, Allen & Hamilton then also worked closely with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is the research arm of the Department of Defense. Judicial Inc's bio of Dov tells us Zakheim is a dual Israeli/American citizen and has been tracking the halls of US government for 25 years, casting defense policy and influence on Presidents Reagan, Clinton, Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. Judicial Inc points out that most of Israel's armaments were gotten thanks to him. Squads of US F-16 and F-15 were classified military surplus and sold to Israel at a fraction of their value. Kenneth Adelman One of many Pentagon Advisors, Adelman also sits on the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board under Perle, and is another extremist pro-Israel advisor, who supported going to war against Iraq. Adelman frequently is a guest on Fox News, and often expresses extremist and often ridiculous anti-Arab and anti-Muslim views. Through his racism or ignorance, he actually called Arabs "anti-Semitic" on Fox News (11/28/2001), when he could have looked it up in the dictionary to find out that Arabs by definition are Semites. I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby Vice President Dick Cheney's ex-Chief of Staff. As chief pro-Israel Jewish advisor to Cheney, it helps explains why Cheney is so gun-ho to invade Iran. Libby is longtime associate of Wolfowitz. Libby was also a lawyer for convicted felon and Israeli spy Marc Rich, whom Clinton pardoned, in his last days as president. Libby was recently found guilty of lying to Federal investigators in the Valerie Plame affair, in which Plame, a covert CIA agent, was exposed for political revenge by the Bush administration following her husband's revelations about the lies leading to the Iraq War. Robert Satloff U.S. National Security Council Advisor, Satloff was the executive director of the Israeli lobby's "think tank," Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Many of the Israeli lobby's "experts" come from this front group, like Martin Indyk. Elliott Abrams National Security Council Advisor. He previously worked at Washington-based "Think Tank" Ethics and Public Policy Center. During the Reagan Administration, Abrams was the Assistant Secretary of State, handling, for the most part, Latin American affairs. He played an important role in the Iran-Contra Scandal, which involved illegally selling U.S. weapons to Iran to fight Iraq, and illegally funding the contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government. He also actively deceived three congressional committees about his involvement and thereby faced felony charges based on his testimony. Abrams pled guilty in 1991 to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service. A year later, former President Bush (Senior) granted Abrams a full pardon. He was one of the more hawkish pro-Israel Jews in the Reagan Administration's State Department. Marc Grossman Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. He was Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources at the Department of State. Grossman is one of many of the pro-Israel Jewish officials from the Clinton Administration that Bush has promoted to higher posts. Richard Haass Director of Policy Planning at the State Department and Ambassador at large. He is also Director of National Security Programs and Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). He was one of the more hawkish pro-Israel Jews in the first Bush (Sr) Administration who sat on the National Security Council, and who consistently advocated going to war against Iraq. Haass is also a member of the Defense Department's National Security Study Group, at the Pentagon. Robert Zoellick U.S. Trade Representative, a cabinet-level position. He is also one of the more hawkish pro-Israel Jews in the Bush (Jr) Administration who advocated invading Iraq and occupying a portion of the country in order to set up a Vichy-style puppet government. He consistently advocates going to war against Iran. {now head of the World Bank - Peter M.} Ari Fleischer Ex- White House Spokesman for the Bush (Jr) Administration. Prominent in the Jewish community, some reports state that he holds Israeli citizenship. Fleischer is closely connected to the extremist Jewish group called the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidics, who follow the Qabala, and hold very extremist and insulting views of non-Jews. Fleischer was the co-president of Chabad's Capitol Jewish Forum. He received the Young Leadership Award from the American Friends of Lubavitch in October, 2001. James Schlesinger One of many Pentagon Advisors, Schlesinger also sits on the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board under Perle and is another extremist pro-Israel advisor, who supported going to war against Iraq. Schlesinger is also a commissioner of the Defense Department's National Security Study Group, at the Pentagon. David Frum White House speechwriter behind the "Axis of Evil" label. He lumped together all the lies and accusations against Iraq for Bush to justify the war. Joshua Bolten White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Bolten was previously a banker, former legislative aide, and prominent in the Jewish community. John Bolton Former UN Representative and Under-Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. Bolton is also a Senior Advisor to President Bush. Prior to this position, Bolton was Senior Vice President of the above mentioned pro-Israel thinktank, AEI. He recently (October 2002) accused Syria of having a nuclear program, so that they can attack Syria after Iraq. He must have forgotten that Israel has 400 nuclear warheads, some of which are thermonuclear weapons (according to a recent U.S. Air Force report). David Wurmser Special Assistant to John Bolton (above), the under-secretary for arms control and international security. Wurmser also worked at the AEI with Perle and Bolton.

Eliot Cohen Member of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board under Perle and is another extremist pro-Israel advisor. Like Adelman, he often expresses extremist and often ridiculus anti-Arab and anti-Muslim views. More recently, he wrote an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal openly admitting his rascist hatred of Islam claiming that Islam should be the enemy, not terrorism.

Subject: JEWS DID 9-11 - NOW YOU CAN BE SURE - Air Traffic Controller Pete Zalewski was responsible for both New York Tower crashes - and also was controller for Egypt 990 crash in 1999
Israel Defense Force Sayeret Matkal Branch - Sayeret Matkal is a deep-penetration unit that has been involved in assassinations, the theft of foreign (US) defense, financial, industrial and diplomatic secrets and the theft and destruction of foreign weapons and research facilities. They did 9-11. Air Traffic Controller Pete Zalewski was responsible for both New York Tower crashes - and also was controller for Egypt 990 crash in 1999, a plane loaded with the highest Egyptian military brass (see below) They were tough enough, bold enough, ruthless enough, and Jewish- supremacist-racist enough to do 9-11 and lie to our faces and mock us for suspecting them ever since. They are tough enough to destroy our economy and end our threat as a source of law and justice which they are doing very successfully right now. They are determined to finish us off before we can take in the facts and develop an organized response. But don't mind me - you just go on attending those Ron Paul, Bob Barr and Barrack Obama rallies - after all it doesn't matter whether Moslems or Jews did 9-11does it, so why should you care, right? TAfter all crime is not Jews doing 9-11, the crime in this country today is daring to point out what they have done. Ain't that right? Well forgive me, but you have to know. Wake up, damn it, and see who has you by the throat. Dick Eastman Yakima, Washington
Air Traffic Controller Pete Zalewski was responsible for both New York Tower crashes - and also was controller for Egypt 990 crash in 1999 911 False Flag
From this video:
At 8:13 Pete Zalewski sees the information on his radar screen that the transponder is no longer transmitting, that the pilot of American Airlines flight 11 is no longer responding and that the flight route has been changed.Instead of immediately sounding the alarm we hear that he attempted repeatedly to contact the aircraft. From 8:13 to 8:24 a.m., this Pete Zalewski supposedly called the captain of AA11, "Hello.. please respond," as opposed to the necessity of securing the airspace he has nothing better to do than try to restore contact. No! I cannot believe that. That cannot be true. If I were the head of an air traffic control center, I would replace the person when I ascertained, that an aircraft that he was responsible for just disappeared into the World Trade Center. He was also responsible for the second aircraft, United Airlines flight 175. The most interesting thing yet, which has been reported by another air traffic controller, is that he was responsible for a third plane - Egypt Airlines flight 990, two years prior, that was packed to the brim with Egyptian military officials of the highest rank. It executed a strange maneuver near the coast then sank into the Atlantic......

After watching this video listen to the details how the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that EgyptAir 990 was taken over by remote control in the early hours of Oct. 31, 1999. I was interviewed by Giuliani here in 2006 but also by Tom Valentine's program where I was interviewed along with Chris Bollyn.
I had no idea until seeing the above German clip that the same JEWISH air traffic controller happened to be assigned to be ATC for Egypt Air and both WTC tower planes.

Also:
"Chris Bollyn has established that there is a connection between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Menachem Atzmon, the man who oversaw passenger screening and airport security at Boston's Logan Airport on 9/11 - Olmert and Atzmon are truly very close political allies and co-defendants in old Likud crimes.""...there is the very bizarre and suspicious Israeli link to the security of U.S. military computers that goes back to the early 1990s. (Remember the reports of Ptech and MITRE engaged in the basement of the FAA before 9/11?)... One must also keep in mind that 9/11 was primarily a computer crime, just like the stealing of our elections. Long before 9/11, a germ was planted in the U.S. defense computer system which allowed for a "super-user" to control the network and create the miscommunications that prevented the U.S. military from defending New York and Washington on that terrible day."As I have written earlier, the members of the YORAN family from Israel are among the key suspects, along with Michael Chertoff and others. I consider the YORANS to be high-ranking Israeli moles who infiltrated the most sensitive computer networks in the U.S. government and military - Zionest agents who facilitated the terror attacks of 9/11."The YORAN family includes, Dr. Chaim Yoran (a.k.a. Elad Yoran), his wife Ruth Lubelski Yoran, and their three sons: Amit Y. Yoran, Dov Yoran, and Naftali Elad Yoran."...The Yoran sons, Amit and Naftali Elad, are graduates of Westpoint. From this U.S.-based launching pad they went on to take over computer security for Dept. of Defense computer networks."
For example, Forbes Magazine, in December 2001, wrote this about Amit Yoran:
"Yoran, 32, earned degrees in computer science from West Point and George Washington University before joining the U.S. Air Force (?), where he took a job overseeing the emergency response team at the Defense Information Systems Agency ( ??). DSIA runs all military networks (!!!)."
Chamish:
"Menachem Atzmon... was Likud Treasurer along with Olmert in the late 80s," I answered. Then he playfully announced, "Did you know he was personally responsible for security at Logan and Newark Airports on 9/11?"
That I DIDN'T know.
Here is Bollyn's report:
OLMERT AND ATZMON Olmert, who has long been tarnished by allegations of financial crimes, was implicated in a financial scandal involving forged receipts for donations to the 1988 Likud campaign, of which he was co-treasurer. This affair culminated in the March 1996 conviction of three other Likudniks, including Menahem Atzmon, the Likud treasurer. Olmert was also later indicted in the Likud affair, but was acquitted.During the 1970s Olmert had worked in the law firm owned by another Atzmon, Uzi Atzmon.Menahem Atzmon, convicted in Israel, went on to become the founder and head of International Consultants on Targeted Security (ICTS), the parent company of Huntleigh USA, the airport security firm that ran passenger screening operations at the airports of Boston and Newark on 9/11.Huntleigh USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of an Israeli company called International Consultants on Targeted Security (ICTS) International N.V., a Netherlands-based aviation and transportation security firm headed by "former [Israeli] military commanding officers and veterans of government intelligence and security agencies."Menachem Atzmon, convicted in Israel in 1996 for campaign finance fraud, and his business partner Ezra Harel, took over management of security at the Boston and Newark airports when their company ICTS bought Huntleigh USA in 1999. UAL Flight 175 and AA 11, which allegedly struck the twin towers, both originated in Boston, while UAL 93, which purportedly crashed in Pennsylvania, departed from the Newark airport.The convicted Israeli criminal Atzmon also controls and operates the German port of Rostock on the Baltic Sea.Some 9/11 victims' families brought lawsuits against Huntleigh claiming the security firm had been grossly negligent on 9-11. While these relatives have a right to discovery and to know what Huntleigh did or did not do to protect their loved ones on 9-11, Huntleigh, along with the other security companies, was granted complete congressional protection in 2002 and will not be called to account for its actions on 9-11 in any U.S. court.Atzmon, a convicted criminal, political ally and co-defendant of Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert, was directly responsible for passenger and airline security at Boston's Logan Airport....Menachem Atzmon resigned as president of Friedman's IDF following his 1996 conviction for Israeli election campaign finance fraud. But his later U.S. activities would prove to be much more disturbing.Atzmon and his business partner Ezra Harel are the majority owners (57%) of ICTS-International Consultants on Targeted Security, run by "former [Israeli] military commanding officers and veterans of government intelligence and security agencies" according its Web site. In 1999, Atzmon's Netherlands-based firm took over management of security at Logan Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, through ICTS' subsidiary Huntleigh USA.This convicted Likud criminal's firm was in charge of security at Logan Airport-inspecting the validity of passports and visas, searching cargo, screening passengers-when two airliners were hijacked from there on Sept. 11, 2001, and demolished the World Trade Center towers in New York.[...]

94 Israelis at Reagan and Dulles airports, each with illegal top security passes at the time of 9-11 - and each quietly deported by Attorney General Ashcroft a few months after the attack.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 100 employees at two major Washington-area airports have been arrested on fraud charges in obtaining restricted airport security badges, government sources said on Tuesday.The arrests will be announced by Attorney General John Ashcroft later in the day in Alexandria, Virginia, officials said.The arrests mark a continuing post Sept. 11 crackdown by U.S. law enforcement and transportation authorities on airport security lapses. Many of the charges - including those being brought against workers at Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport outside the capital involve allegations that suspects violated immigration and Social Security laws.Also, the government alleges that many arrested on Tuesday in the greater Washington area lied about criminal records while applying for security badges, the sources said.It was unclear initially what jobs those employees performed. As of last week, more than 250 people had been arrested at 11 U.S. airports on charges they fraudulently obtained credentials for access to sensitive airport areas like ramps, gates and aircraft.Roughly half have pleaded guilty or have plea arguments pending, authorities said. More than 70 have been deported or are awaiting deportation proceedings, 94 foreigners in the country illegally with top-security badges were at Dulles and Reagan airports on 9/11/01
From "Zacheim - Following Zakheim and Pentagon trillions to Israel and 9-11"
July 31, 2006 Most people familiar with the 9/11 cover-up have a fair idea of some of the key players in the monumental 9/11 crime.
Rabbi Dov Zakheim, one of the central figures in this vile operation, isn't as well known because he's one who has always lurked in the shadows.
Zakheim is as powerful as he is inconspicuous, and a man of many talents:
Graduate of the prestigious London School of Economics (PhD), and the University of Oxford (National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow)
Former CEO of Systems Planning Corporation, a highly specialized defense technology company that manufactures a one-of-a-kind remote-piloting system for aircraft, including commercial airliners (see below)
Senior Fellow for Asian Studies of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)
Member of the Task Force on Defense Reform (appointed by Secretary of Defense Cohen)
Senior Advisor at the Center for International and Strategic Studies
Former Under Secretary of Defense (appointed by George W. Bush)
Comptroller of the Pentagon (see [1] below for performance report)
Pioneer and prime architect of /Project for the New American Century /(PNAC), the neo-con cabal that authored /Rearming Americas Defenses/ (RAD), the bible for American global domination [2]
Author of Flight Of The Lavi: Inside A US-Israeli Crisis (Brasseys, 1996)
Long-time Bush associate, having served as a policy advisor to the governor during the 2000 campaign
Columnist for The Jerusalem Post
Editorial Board member of Israel Affairs
Ordained Rabbi
Citizen of the State of Israel
[How a citizen of Israel can serve as Comptroller of Americas central defense establishment is a question I shall leave to others for comment. While they ponder this perturbing oddity, perhaps they could also shed light on why every one of the following kingpins of the Bush administration are also Israeli citizens: Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Douglas Feith, Michael Chertoff, George Tenet, Elliot Abrams, Donald Kagan, Richard Haas, Kenneth Adelman, Edward Luttwak, Robert Satloff, David Frum, David Wurmser, Steve Goldsmith, and MarcGrossman.]
[1] I know Dr. Zakheim has been trying to hire CPAs because the financial systems of the department are so snarled up that we cant account for some /_$2.6 TRILLION_/ in transactions that exist... - Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, during testimony before the House Appropriations Committee: Fiscal Year 2002 Defense Budget Request, as given by Secy. Rumsfeld, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton, and Comptroller Dov Zakheim; on Monday, July 16, 2001./ [NB: Dr. Zakheim resigned as Pentagon Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer at the beginning of March when it was revealed that the he is unable to account for the disappearance of $2.6 trillion(its unlikely this will receive much coverage in the mainstream media). Zakheim has since taken a lucrative position as a vice president of the mega-consultancy Booz, Allen, & Hamilton (one that also works closely with DARPA). Rabbi Zakheim is also Chief Executive Officer of SPC International Corporation (a subsidiary of the aforementioned remote-flight-control-technology firm), a company that specializes in political, military, and economic consulting, and international sales and analysis. In addition, Dr. Zakheim serves as Consultant to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. As the Rabbis record clearly shows, he has serious tenure in the US defense establishment: more than 30 years of holding assorted senior positions at the Pentagon.]
[2] Dov Zakheim is the co-author of that singularly sinister-and chillingly ominous-statement contained in Rearming Americas Defenses (RAD) re the plan for American global domination [through galvanizing American emotional support for full-scale war against oil-rich Arab states]: ...the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, /absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event-like a new Pearl Harbor/. The PNAC document also expressly recommends the US should seize Iraq /even if Saddam Hussein were deposed through a military coup/. [So much for bringing freedom and democracy to the people of that country.]
The good Rabbis involvement with PNAC, his previous directorship of a corporation that manufactures remote control flight systems, and his inability to document how the Pentagon has spent TRILLIONS of American taxpayers dollars suggests that real investigations into the crimes of 9/11 and the US invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq would put Mr. Zakheim near the top of the witness list for interrogation and potential prosecution.
SYSTEMS PLANNING CORPORATION
Dr. Dov Zakheim was the former CEO of Systems Planning Corporation, a company that designs and manufactures extremely sophisticated control/guidance technology that enables an external operator to fly, and land, aircraft by remote control.
One of the company's principal products is the Command Transmitter System (CTS), a fully redundant, self-contained, solid-state platform capable of providing totally programmable remote flight control capability, including high- precision electronic navigation. The company's parallel product, the Flight Termination System (FTS), enables system-equipped aircraft to be safely landed on any suitable runway in the world-regardless of the availability of ground-based navigational or landing aids (VOR, ILS, MLS, etc.). Such total independence in all flight regimes is achieved through a variety of ultra-sophisticated space-based technologies, including Mil-spec DGPS (Differential GPS, using extremely precise encrypted military "P" Code transmissions), and is accurate to within /one foot/ of the runway centerline during landing. * The CTS/FTS remote-control system is capable of controlling up to 8 airborne vehicles-including airliners-simultaneously from ground-based or airborne (AWACS) positions. * ["Coincidence": Operation Vigilant Guardian, one of five NORAD "war game exercises" underway on the morning of 9/11 and orchestrated byDick Cheney, involved the *simulated hijacking of commercial airliners*. At one point during the exercises, while the four "real" hijacked aircraft were airborne, as many as TWENTY-TWO independent radar blips representing "hijacked" aircraft were simultaneously displayed on FAA radar screens along the Eastern seaboard. This, obviously, created total pandemonium. Air traffic controllers who had been advised beforehand by NORAD of the "simulated hijackings", began frantically calling NORAD to determine which of the twenty-two targets were "real" and which were "exercise." All indications are that whatever it was that happened to the four real "hijacked" airliners occurred during this purposefully orchestrated melee while the order was given for the US Air Force to "stand down".] The CTS/FTS system (subsequently improved, tested and implemented by Raytheon) allows specialist ground controllers to listen-in on cockpit conversations on the target aircraft, then take absolute control of its computerized flight control system by remote means and safely land the aircraft at any airport within range. In other words, this technology was designed to empower "law enforcement agencies" to hijack hijackers. [NB: The ground station technology for CTS/FTS was developed by Raytheon under an Air Force contract for the Joint Precision Approach and Landings System (JPALS) program. A government-industry team accomplished the first precision approach/auto-land by a civil aircraft using this system on August 25, 2001 at Holloman AFB, NM. 'A FedEx Express 727-200 aircraft demonstrated hundred percent system proficiency by executing six full auto-lands using the JPALS ground station'.]
"HOME RUN"
In partnership with Raytheon, System Planning Corporation also supplies CTS/FTS technology to commercial airplane manufacturers for installation in airliners (Boeing: confirmed; Airbus: undetermined, but highly probable given the consortium's connection to BAE, a US military contractor.) It has been reported that DARPA's codename for the CTS/FTS system was "Home Run". Former German Secretary of Defense Andreas Von Buelow may have alluded to foreknowledge of Home Run technology in an interview he gave the German daily "Tagesspiegel" on January 13th, 2002:
"There is also the theory of one British flight engineer: according to this, the steering of the planes was perhaps taken out of the pilots' hands, from outside. The Americans had developed a method in the 1970s, whereby they could rescue hijacked planes by intervening into the computer piloting [automatic pilot system]. This theory says this technique was abused in this case [9/11]..."
Upon deeper scrutiny this may not appear quite so much a "theory" as might first seem.
It's been reported that the German national carrier Lufthansa, seriously concerned that one of its own aircraft might be "rescued" by the Americans without its authority, had every one of its Home Run-equipped Boeing aircraft stripped of the American flight control computers. It's reasonable to presume that Herr Von Buelow - the Secretary of Defense and Minister of Science and Technology at the time-would have known all about this mammoth but secretive task (how very clever-and discreet-of Von Buelow to "drop" the information into the middle of an interview about the 9/11 attacks).
Lufthansa aircraft (and possibly others) are now effectively impervious to Home Run take-overs, but that is more than can be said for the American aircraft fleet. In order to make Home Run truly effective, it had to be completely integrated with all onboard systems, and this could only be accomplished with a new aircraft design, several of which were on the drawing boards at that time. Under cover of extreme secrecy, the multinationals and DARPA went ahead on this basis and built "back doors" into the new computerized flight control systems. There were two very obvious hard requirements at this stage: 1) a primary control channel for use in taking over the flight control system and flying the aircraft back to an airfield of choice, and 2) a covert audio channel for monitoring flight deck conversations. Once the primary channel was activated, all aircraft functions came under direct ground (or AWACS) control, permanently removing the hijackers and pilots from the control loop. It needs mention that this was not a system designed to "undermine" the authority of the flight crews, but rather, implemented as a "doomsday" device in the event the hijackers began to shoot passengers or crew members, possibly including the pilots.
Based on the reasonable assumption that hijackers only carry a limited number of rounds of ammunition, and many modern airliners carry in excess of 300 passengers, Home Run was envisaged as a system that could be used to fly all the survivors to a friendly airport for a safe landing.
System Activation
Activating the primary Home Run channel is reportedly fairly straightforward.
A transponder, as many readers know, is a combined radio transmitter and receiver which operates automatically-in the case of 9/11, relaying data between the four aircraft and air traffic controllers on the ground. The transmitted signals represent a unique "identity" for each aircraft, essential in crowded airspace to avoid midair collisions-and equally essential for Home Run controllers trying to lock onto the correct aircraft. Once the correct target aircraft is located by radar, the Home Run duplex data bus "piggy backs" the transponder channel and assumes direct control from the ground. This could explain why NONE of the four aircraft sent the special "I have been hijacked" transponder code (7500), despite 'multiple activation points' for this distress transmission on all four aircraft-and despite being flown by combat-hardened ex-fighter pilots.
Because the transponder frequency had already been piggy-backed by Home Run, transmission of the special hijack code was rendered impossible. This was the first hard proof that the target aircraft had been hijacked electronically from the ground, rather than by Arab patsies toting box-cutters. The Home Run listening device on the flight deck utilizes the cockpit microphones that normally feed the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), one of two black boxes armored to withstand heavy impact and thereby later provide investigators significant clues to why the aircraft crashed. However, once plugged into Home Run, the CVRs are bypassed, and voice transmissions are no longer recorded on the 30minute continuous-loop recording tape. If Home Run is active for more than thirty minutes, there will therefore be no audible data on the Cockpit Voice Recorders. Crash investigators are said to have recovered the CVRs from the Pentagon and Pittsburg aircraft, and publicly confirmed that both are completely blank.
The only possible reason for this is data capture by Home Run, providing the final hard proof that the attack aircraft were hijacked electronically from the ground, rather than by "Arab terrorists".
Discussion
It is not being suggested that remote circumvention and take-over of the four airliners' controls is definitely what happened on 9/11.
But if this scenario seems improbable, one must necessarily consider the probability of four airliners being taken over simultaneously, casually flown around a large swath of the country for almost two hours under the vigilant eye of NORAD, and then used as missiles-all without a single fighter being scrambled to intercept any of them. Since this is what actually happened, we have no choice but to consider other "implausible" scenarios. And since the official scenario is itself an unsubstantiated-and truly farfetched-"conspiracy theory," other competing scenarios should also receive serious attention. The public's reluctance to question official doctrine on this matter is a symptom of the societal role for which most of us have been bred and trained: to be ever-faithful hounds, tails thumping the floor as we contentedly slurp the hand of class authority.
Such credulity also becomes inevitable when the alternative is so unbearable: if someone in Bush's position is capable of lying to us about something as huge, as gut-wrenchingly horrible as 9/11, then everything we believe about this country-about the nature of civilization itself-might just be childish nonsense. Most people simply don't have the guts to go there. Given a desperate enough need to sustain the childish belief in government-as-benevolent-father, a person will adapt that belief to any circumstance. The behavioral end result can resemble courage; indeed, we are taught to regard it as the DEFINITION of courage. Actually, it's one of cowardice's darkest moments. Even a casual examination of Nazi Germany, where this phenomenon was rampant, will drive this point home. It's almost funny, the way people readily see the threat of technological circumvention presented by Diebold's electronic voting machines, yet when the subject switches to Systems Planning Corporation's Flight Termination System, which is every bit as real, and to the exactly parallel possibilities it represents vis-a-vis 9/11, they suddenly retreat into profound and combative denial.
It's as if a threshold has been crossed into a realm of possibilities too vile to entertain, so they simply don't. Never mind that this country's operatives have been traveling the world, perpetrating similar horrors, for all of the past century. Rather than acknowledge the possibility of a unifying pattern, Joe Sixpack would much rather 'shoot the messenger.' Every so often, such people establish a new high-water mark for cowardice and facultative stupidity, and the present is definitely one of those times.
After all, the official 9/11 scenario they cling to with such desperate faith comes from only one source: the Western "intelligence community"-the most brazen, systematic, resourceful, and interlocked association of habitual liars this world has ever seen. As should have been made clear by any number of intelligence scandals over the years, the credibility of this bunch goes past zero into the negative: pending airtight proof, anything they say should be reflexively deemed a lie.
You may remember that the FBI also provided the identities of "the 19 hijackers" within hours-information that soon also became quite suspect, especially considering there was NOT ONE Arab name on any of the flight manifests (miraculously, they even found paper passports that had survived fireballs, Arabic flight manuals conveniently left in the trunks of cars, etc., etc.) At least seven of the hijackers are still alive in the Middle East-a pretty good alibi, wouldn't you say? Several of these ex-suspects had their passports or other IDs stolen from them over the years, and it's entirely possible that all 19 hijackers had stolen identities, meaning they could have come from anywhere-or been absent altogether.
Our media were pretty slack about acknowledging this at the time, and since then have dropped this ball entirely. What's really amazing is that not one mainstream journalist has asked how these 19 alleged hijackers boarded their aircraft when their names were not on any of the passenger manifests. Rather than allow the "intelligence community" to render every detail of our comprehension on this matter, we would be much wiser to carefully identify and discard every assumption they hand us.

Subject: Chertoff, Zakheim, Perle, Wolfowitz and a hundred others in high places have Dual US-Israeli Citizenship - where does their loyalty lie? (UK Telegraph blog) Dual Citizenship - where does the loyalty lie? UK Telegraph blog 17 May 2008 In this increasingly mobile world more and more people are acquiring dual citizenship. Usually it's simply their adopted country and their native country but in some cases, particularly in the USA, there is another motive for duality. Take a look at these people who currently or have recently held positions of great influence and power in the American administration and ask yourself where do their loyalties lie? Puzzling too is the fact that under US law if you take up the citizenship of another country you relinquish your US citizenship. So how do these people achieve the impossible?
If you are a supporter of the Israeli state how do you feel about the USA being infiltrated and usurped by its friend 'ally'?
Dual Citizenship - Loyal to Whom? (With all acknowledgements to Dan Eden who has produced a very comprehensive and revealing article)
Michael Mukasey Recently appointed as US Attorney General. Mukasey also was the judge in the litigation between developer Larry Silverstein and several insurance companies arising from the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11/2001.
Michael Chertoff Former Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, at the Justice Department; now head of Homeland Security.
Richard Perle One of Bush's foreign policy advisors, he is the chairman of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board. A very likely Israeli government agent, Perle was expelled from Senator Henry Jackson's office in the 1970's after the National Security Agency (NSA) caught him passing Highly-Classified (National Security) documents to the Israeli Embassy.
He later worked for the Israeli weapons firm, Soltam. Perle came from one the above mentioned pro-Israel thinktanks, the AEI. Perle is one of the leading pro-Israeli fanatics leading this Iraq war mongering within the administration and now in the media.
Paul Wolfowitz Former Deputy Defense Secretary, and member of Perle's Defense Policy Board, in the Pentagon. Wolfowitz is a close associate of Perle, and reportedly has close ties to the Israeli military. His sister lives in Israel. Wolfowitz came from the above mentioned Jewish think-tank, JINSA. Wolfowitz was the number two leader within the administration behind this Iraq war mongering.
He later was appointed head of the World Bank but resigned under pressure from World Bank members over a scandal involving his misuse of power.
Lawrence (Larry) Franklin The former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst with expertise in Iranian policy issues who worked in the office of Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith and reported directly to Feith's deputy, William Luti, was sentenced January 20, 2006,
"to more than 12 years in prison for giving classified information to an Israeli diplomat" and members of the pro-Israel lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Franklin will "remain free while the government continues with the wider case" and his "prison time could be sharply reduced in return for his help in prosecuting" former AIPAC members Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman, [who] are scheduled to go on trial in April [2006]. Franklin admitted that he met periodically with Rosen and Weissman between 2002 and 2004 and discussed classified information, including information about potential attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq. Rosen and Weissman would later share what they learned with reporters and Israeli officials."

(source: sourcewatch.com).
Douglas Feith Under Secretary of Defense and Policy Advisor at the Pentagon. He is a close associate of Perle and served as his Special Counsel. Like Perle and the others, Feith is a pro-Israel extremist, who has advocated anti-Arab policies in the past.
He is closely associated with the extremist group, the Zionist Organization of America, which even attacks Jews that don't agree with its extremist views. Feith frequently speaks at ZOA conferences. Feith runs a small law firm, Feith and Zell, which only has one International office, in Israel.
The majority of their legal work is representing Israeli interests. His firm's own website stated, prior to his appointment, that Feith "represents Israeli Armaments Manufacturer." Feith basically represents the Israeli War Machine. Feith also came from the Jewish thinktank JINSA. Feith, like Perle and Wolfowitz, are campaigning hard for this Israeli proxy war against Iraq. Feith was investigated by the FBI under suspicion of leaking classified information to Israel, being that he was Larry Franklin's boss when Franklin leaked those documents to Rosen and Weissman of AIPAC. For that he was forced to leave the National Security Council. Feith was also investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee for sexing up 'intelligence' that was used to justify invading Iraq.
Edward Luttwak Member of the National Security Study Group of the Department of Defence at the Pentagon. Luttwak is reportedly an Israeli citizen and has taught in Israel. He frequently writes for Israeli and pro-Israeli newspapers and journals. Luttwak is an Israeli extremist whose main theme in many of his articles is the necessity of the U.S. waging war against Iraq and Iran.
Henry Kissinger One of many Pentagon Advisors, Kissinger sits on the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board under Perle. For detailed information about Kissinger's evil past, read Seymour Hersch's book (Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House). Kissinger likely had a part in the Watergate crimes, Southeast Asia mass murders (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos), Installing Chilean mass murdering dictator Pinochet, Operation Condor's mass killings in South America, and more recently served as Serbia's Ex-Dictator Slobodan Milosevic's Advisor.
He consistently advocated going to war against Iraq. Kissinger is the Ariel Sharon of the U.S. Unfortunately, President Bush nominated Kissinger as chairman of the September 11 investigating commission. It's like picking a bank robber to investigate a fraud scandal. He later declined this job under enormous protests.
Dov Zakheim Dov Zakheim is an ordained rabbi and reportedly holds Israeli citizenship. Zakheim attended Jew's College in London and became an ordained Orthodox Jewish Rabbi in 1973. He was adjunct professor at New York's Jewish Yeshiva University. Zakheim is close to the Israeli lobby. Dov Zakheim is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and in 2000 a co-author of the Project for the New American Century's position paper, Rebuilding America's Defenses, advocating the necessity for a Pearl-Harbor-like incident to mobilize the country into war with its enemies, mostly Middle Eastern Muslim nations.
He was appointed by Bush as Pentagon Comptroller from May 4, 2001 to March 10, 2004. At that time he was unable to explain the disappearance of $1 trillion dollars. Actually, nearly three years earlier, Donald Rumsfeld announced on September 10, 2001 that an audit discovered $2.3 trillion was also missing from the Pentagon books. That story, as mentioned, was buried under 9-11's rubble. The two sums disappeared on Zakheim's watch. We can only guess where that cash went. Despite these suspicions, on May 6, 2004, Zakheim took a lucrative position at Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the most prestigious strategy consulting firms in the world. One of its clients then was Blessed Relief, a charity said to be a front for Osama bin Laden. Booz, Allen & Hamilton then also worked closely with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is the research arm of the Department of Defense.
Judicial Inc's bio of Dov tells us Zakheim is a dual Israeli/American citizen and has been tracking the halls of US government for 25 years, casting defense policy and influence on Presidents Reagan, Clinton, Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. Judicial Inc points out that most of Israel's armaments were gotten thanks to him.
Squads of US F-16 and F-15 were classified military surplus and sold to Israel at a fraction of their value.
Kenneth Adelman One of many Pentagon Advisors, Adelman also sits on the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board under Perle, and is another extremist pro-Israel advisor, who supported going to war against Iraq. Adelman frequently is a guest on Fox News, and often expresses extremist and often ridiculous anti-Arab and anti-Muslim views.
Through his racism or ignorance, he actually called Arabs "anti-Semitic" on Fox News (11/28/2001), when he could have looked it up in the dictionary to find out that Arabs by definition are Semites.
I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby Vice President Dick Cheney's ex-Chief of Staff. As chief pro-Israel Jewish advisor to Cheney, it helps explains why Cheney is so gun-ho to invade Iran. Libby is longtime associate of Wolfowitz. Libby was also a lawyer for convicted felon and Israeli spy Marc Rich, whom Clinton pardoned, in his last days as president.
Libby was recently found guilty of lying to Federal investigators in the Valerie Plame affair, in which Plame, a covert CIA agent, was exposed for political revenge by the Bush administration following her husband's revelations about the lies leading to the Iraq War.
Robert Satloff U.S. National Security Council Advisor, Satloff was the executive director of the Israeli lobby's "think tank," Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Many of the Israeli lobby's "experts" come from this front group, like Martin Indyk.
Elliott Abrams National Security Council Advisor. He previously worked at Washington-based "Think Tank" Ethics and Public Policy Center. During the Reagan Administration, Abrams was the Assistant Secretary of State, handling, for the most part, Latin American affairs. He played an important role in the Iran-Contra Scandal, which involved illegally selling U.S. weapons to Iran to fight Iraq, and illegally funding the contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
He also actively deceived three congressional committees about his involvement and thereby faced felony charges based on his testimony. Abrams pled guilty in 1991 to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service. A year later, former President Bush (Senior) granted Abrams a full pardon. He was one of the more hawkish pro-Israel Jews in the Reagan Administration's State Department.
