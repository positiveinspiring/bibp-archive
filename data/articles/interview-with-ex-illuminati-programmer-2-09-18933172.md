Q: Svali, earlier on you talked about
sacrifices. You are talking
about animal sacrifices, right? Give me a bit more details about
that, please.
A: I hate to sensationalize things by going into gruesome
particulars, but I will share a little.
First, please remember that
the Illuminati have SIX branches of
learning, and the spiritual (where the sacrifices are done) is only
ONE part of what they do. I was in Sciences, and used to make fun of
people who specialized in spiritual. Yes, everyone has to go to
spiritual rituals during certain high days, but I tried to stay as
far from it as I could. It's ugly, crude, and gross, but considered
important.
1. The celtic branch of
spiritual believes that power is passed at
the moment between life and death. They will do rituals with
children, or even older adherents, where the person is tied down,
and an animal is bled to death on top of them. The belief is that
the person receives power from the departing spirit, which "enters"
the person. It is also highly traumatizing and horrible to have an
animal go through its death throes on top of you. Throw in a few
threats that "this will happen to you if you ever tell," and a quite
strong impression is made on small children.
2. Opening portals and dimensions: I know, this sounds like stuff
from a sci-fi film, but these people really believe that there are
other spiritual dimensions, and that to pass into them, first a
major sacrifice is done to "open a portal", usually several animals.
I have also seen animal sacrifices done to protect from the demonic,
or blood used to "close a circle" so the demonic cannot penetrate
it.
The Illuminists very much believe in the spiritual realm, and have
codified practiced over hundreds of years from ancient occultic
rituals. They believe they can control these powers (I believe they
are deluded).
Sacrifices are also done on high holy days. I have seen an animal
"psychically killed" in front of me, and have no way to explain what
I saw. I have also seen human sacrifice, but these were very rare (I
believe I have seen two or three real ones in my life, the rest were
set-ups).
They really don't want to kill off their children, they want a new
generation to grow up and continue the practices. I have also heard
of them buying children from other countries, and using them, or the
homeless, but never witnessed it myself.
More often, I saw
animals used in sacrifices and rituals. Other loss
of life, rare but horrible, I saw as a head trainer because of my
job. Rarely, a trainer would push a person too far, and didn't check
for signs of stress. Especially with some of the newer medications
used to create trance states, their meds covered the more obvious
signs of trauma and stress (elevated heart rate, rapid breathing,
tremors, pupil size changing), or blunted them.
Inexperienced trainers would miss more subtle signs, and basically
screw a person up. It is horrible to work with a person, and they
NEVER COME BACK. They become a vegetable, or worse, they scream and
scream for hours without end.
We occasionally had to "put down" these training failures, by using
a lethal injection of air, or insulin. The person was then set up in
a "fatal crash" or "fire" to dispose of the body. May God forgive me
for the few times this happened and I was forced to act. I so regret
it now. A person cannot be kind or sympathetic. And, the trainer
always knows that it could be them next on the table, screaming, so
they do their jobs well.
Any failures are heavily punished, to say the least. One of my jobs
was teaching younger trainers the masking effects of hypnotic drug
combinations, and how to recognize subtle clues of distress. Sigh.
Do the failures count as "sacrifices" to a horrible evil that is
perpetrated on others? I think so, even though there was no ritual
about it at all, it was all done in a training room with lab coats
and needles.
Q: Svali, I have to ask you this: There are stories floating around
on the internet about the Illuminati (and other agencies) being run
by extra-terrestrials, ET's, in particular a reptilian race,
operating from a higher dimension. Any thoughts on that?
A: My answer will probably cause a lot of anger, and it's not meant
to step on any toes. Here it goes.
I have never seen an alien or extra-terrestial. I have seen some
programming to make people THINK they saw aliens, as a cover story
for programming, if they remembered. None of the head trainers I
knew, or others on leadership council, believed in aliens, although
I never asked them.
I personally believe that the reptilian stuff is actually the
demonic at work. I have seen shape-shifting and other stuff because
of demonic influence (okay, so here some will say, gee, she believes
in demons, that's as far out as aliens).
Well, this is what
the Illuminati certainly believe in. They KNOW
there are spiritual realities, and think they can control them.
Those of a more cynical bent would say the shape shifting was a drug
induced hallucination and group hysteria in the context of a ritual
setting. I will let each reader decide based on their personal
comfort zone. But no, absolutely no reptiles or aliens seen in
Washington, DC, or San Diego, Ca. as of 5 years ago, at least I
never saw them.
