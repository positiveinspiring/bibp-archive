Extensive war crimes have been committed.
NATO has blood on its hands. The heads of
government and heads of state of NATO member countries are responsible for
extensive war crimes
The "pro-democracy" rebels are led by Al Qaeda paramilitary brigades under
the supervision of NATO Special Forces. The "Liberation" of Tripoli was
carried out by "former" members of the Libya Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG).
The jihadists and NATO work hand in glove. These "former" Al Qaeda
affiliated brigades constitute the backbone of the "pro-democracy"
rebellion.
NATO special forces with "boots and the ground" pass unnoticed. Their
identity is not known or revealed. They blend into the Libyan rebellion
landscape of machine guns and pickup trucks. They are not highlighted in the
photo ops.
Special forces composed of US Navy SEALS, British Special SAS Forces and
French legionnaires, disguised in civilian rebel garb, are reported to be
behind major operations directed against key government buildings including
Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound in central Tripoli.
Reports confirm that British SAS were on the ground in Eastern Libya prior
to the onset of the air campaign.
Special Forces are in close coordination with
NATO air operations.
"Highly-trained units, known as Smash
teams for their prowess and destructive ability, have carried out secret
reconnaissance missions to provide up-to-date information on the Libyan
armed forces."
(SAS 'Smash' squads on the ground in
Libya to mark targets for coalition jets, Daily Mirror, March 21, 2011)
NATO special forces and the CIA sponsored
Islamic brigades under the command of "former" jihadists constitute the
backbone of combat capabilities on the ground, supported by the air
campaign, which now includes Apache helicopter raids.
The remainder of the rebel forces include untrained trigger happy gunmen
(including teenagers) (see photo below), which serve the function of
creating an atmosphere of panic and intimidation.
What we are dealing with is a carefully planned military intelligence
operation to invade and occupy a sovereign country.

Killing the Truth -
The Role of the Western Media
The Western media constitutes a major instrument of war.
NATO war crimes are
obfuscated. Popular resistance to the NATO led invasion is not mentioned.
A narrative of "liberation" and "opposition pro-democracy rebel forces" is
instilled in the inner consciousness of millions of people. Its called the
"NATO Consensus".
"The NATO Consensus" which upholds the "humanitarian mandate" of the
Atlantic alliance cannot be challenged. The bombings of civilian areas as
well as the role of a terrorist militia are either trivialized or not
mentioned.
Killing the truth is an integral part of the military agenda.
Realities are turned upside down.
The lie becomes the truth.
Its an inquisitorial doctrine. The NATO consensus dwarfs the Spanish
Inquisition by a long shot.
The criminal invasion and occupation of Libya is not mentioned. The lives of
independent journalists in Tripoli who report on what is actually happening
are threatened. The catch words are "Liberation" and "Revolution" with
NATO's mandate limited to R2P ("Responsibility to Protect").
Liberation or Invasion?
By camouflaging the nature of the military
operation, not to mention NATO atrocities, the Western media has contributed
to providing the Transitional Council with a semblance of legitimacy and
international recognition. The latter would not have been forthcoming
without the support of the Western media.
NATO special forces and intelligence operatives on the ground are in
permanent liaison with military planners involved in coordinating NATO
strike sorties and bombing raids on the Libyan capital.
Intensive Bombing
Raids over Tripoli
On August 27, NATO acknowledged the conduct of 20,633 sorties since March
31st, and 7,768 strike sorties. (These figures do not include the intensive
bombing raids conducted in the two weeks prior to March 31st).
Each fighter jet or bomber carries numerous
missiles, rockets, etc. depending on the ordnance specification of the
aircraft.
Multiply the number of strike sorties (7768 since March 31) by the average
number of missiles or bombs launched by each of the planes and you get a
rough idea of the size and magnitude of this military operation. A French
Dassault Mirage 2000, for instance, can transport 18 missiles under its
wings.
America's B-2 Stealth bombers are equipped with
bunker buster bombs.

Pursuant to NATO's humanitarian mandate, we are
informed by the media that these tens of thousands of strikes have not
resulted in civilian casualties (with the exception of occasional
"collateral damage").
Not surprisingly, already in mid April, three weeks into the bombing
campaign, the Atlantic Alliance announced that,
"NATO planes flying combat missions over
Libya are starting to run out of bombs."
(UPI, April 16, 2011)
"The reason we need more capability isn't because we aren't hitting what
we see - it's so that we can sustain the ability to do so," one NATO
official told the Post. "One problem is flight time, the other is
munitions."
(Ibid)
The bombing raids over Tripoli were intensified
in the course of the last two weeks.
They were intended to support ground operations
led by NATO special forces and the Islamic paramilitary brigades. With
limited NATO ground force capabilities, NATO strategists decided to
intensify the bombing raids.
Global Research's Correspondent in Tripoli, whose life was threatened for
revealing NATO war crimes described a shift in the pattern of bombing,
starting in mid-July, with increasingly intensive air raids leading up to
the ground invasion on August 20th:
"Until approximately 2:35 a.m EET [July 17],
the strident noises of fighter jets over Tripoli could be heard.
The
bomb blasts triggered an atmosphere of fear and panic over the entire
city, a poignant psychological and emotional impact on tens of thousands
of people, from the young to the elderly. It also alerted people and
brought them out onto their balconies while they witnessed the bombing
of their country.
One of the explosions resulted in a huge mushroom cloud, pointing to the
possible use of bunker buster bombs... There was something unusual in
the pattern of this NATO bombing operation.
The bombings tonight were not like other nights. The sounds were
different. The smoke plumes were different. In previous bombings the
smoke would usually go up vertically like a fire, but tonight the smoke
plumes were horizontal and hovering above Tripoli with a white cloud in
the horizon.
People who were not directly affected by the bombs, within a radius of
15 kilometers experienced burning eyes, lower back pain, headaches."
(Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya,
NATO Launches
Bombing Blitzkrieg over Tripoli hitting Residential Areas , Global
Research, July 17, 2011)
The mass killing of civilians in a Blitzkrieg
environment as well as the creation of a generalized atmosphere of panic is
intended to curtail the population's resistance to the NATO-led invasion.
The Death Toll
According to sources from our correspondent in Tripoli, the death toll in
the course of the last week (20-26 August) is of the order of 3000.
The hospitals are in a state of turmoil, unable
to come to the rescue of the wounded. The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) confirms that medical supplies are in short supply
throughout the country.
In recent developments UNICEF has warned of shortages of water due to the
NATO bombing of water infrastructure throughout the country.
"This could turn into an unprecedented
health epidemic said Christian Balslev-Olesen of UNICEF's Libya Office.
NATO warplanes deliberately targeted the
peaceful vigil of tents in front of the Gadhafi compound in a gruesome
massacre. The
mainstream media acknowledges the massacre, while stating that
gun wounds are the cause of death in crossfire between loyalist and rebel
forces.
The victims are:
"The identities of the dead were unclear,
but they were in all likelihood activists who had set up an impromptu
tent city in solidarity with Gadhafi in defiance of the NATO bombing
campaign."
(Forbes.com, August 25, 2011)
We are not dealing with collateral damage.
Extensive war crimes have been committed. NATO has blood on its hands.
The heads of government and heads of state of
NATO member countries are war criminals.
The Central Role of Al
Qaeda Operatives in the "Liberation of Tripoli"
According to CNN, in a twisted logic, the terrorists have repented:
"former
terrorists" are no longer "terrorists".
The LIFG is said to have been disbanded.
Following their disavowal of violence, these former LIFG leaders created a
new political organization called the Islamic Movement for Change,
which according to CNN,
"is committed to working within a future
democratic process".
"The Libyan Islamic Movement for Change (Al-Haraka
Al-Islamiya Al Libiya Lit-Tahghir), is made up of former members of the
now defunct [CIA supported] Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG)"
(Reuters, August 26, 2011)
In a contradictory about turn, former "bad guys"
(terrorists) are heralded as "good guys" committed to "combating terrorism".
The "former" members of the Libya Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) are
now portrayed as,
"pro-democracy activists" who "have assumed
leadership positions in several rebel brigades".
Labels have been switched:
the CIA supported Al
Qaeda affiliated LIFG has been transformed into the CIA sponsored Islamic
Movement for Change (IMC), which supports the pro-democracy rebellion.
When was the LIFG disbanded?
In a bitter irony, the Libya Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) was
listed until June 2011 by the United Nations Security
Council (see pag. 77) as a bona fide terrorist organization.
On June 21 2011,
The Listing of Terrorist Organizations,
conveniently vanished from the UN Security Council website pending the
revamping of the website. (below insert)
Who Leads Libya's Islamic
Brigades?
Recent reports confirm what was known and documented from the outset of the,
"rebellion" in mid-March: The key military
command positions of the rebellion are held by the "former" commanders
of the Libya Islamic fighting Group (LIFG)".
The commander of the assault on Tripoli is Abdel
Hakim Belhadj, (also known as Abu Abdullah al-Sadeq, Hakim al-Hasidi).
He has been entrusted, with NATO's approval, of,
"one of the most powerful rebel brigades in
Tripoli [which] took charge of successful rebel efforts earlier this
week to storm Gadhafi's Bab al-Azziziyah compound, further bolstering
his prominent position in rebel ranks."
(CNN, op cit)
"Sadeeq was a well-known figure in the
jihadist movement. He fought the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan
and helped found [with the support of the CIA] the Libyan Islamic
Fighting Group there."
(Ibid)
But Saddeeq, according to CNN has repented.
He
is no longer a terrorist (i.e. a bad guy),
"but a powerful voice against Al Qaeda's
terrorism".
(Ibid)
"In 2009, Sadeeq and other senior LIFG leaders formally repudiated al
Qaeda style terrorism and disbanded their campaign to overthrow the
Libyan regime."
The breakthrough was the result of a two-year dialogue with the regime
brokered by Benotman [a former LIFG commander now in the employ of the
London based Quilliam Foundation] with a mandate in conflict resolution.
CNN interviewed leading figures of the LIFG in Abu Salim prison in
Tripoli in September 2009, shortly before the group's leaders were
released.
Although they were then behind prison bars,
the leaders' disavowal of violence appeared genuine."
(Ibid)
According to DebkaFile (Israeli intelligence
online report), the "pro-Al Qaeda brigades" led by LIFG Commander Abdel
Hakim Belhadj constitute the dominant force of the rebellion, overriding the
authority of the Transitional Council.
They are in control of strategic buildings
including Gadhafi's compound.
"The LIFG chief [Abdel Hakim Belhadj] now
styles himself 'Commander of the Tripoli Military Council'."
Asked by our sources whether they plan to hand
control of the Libyan capital to the National Transitional Council, which
has been recognized in the West, the jihadi fighters made a gesture of
dismissal without answering. (Debka, Pro-Al Qaeda brigades control Qaddafi
Tripoli strongholds seized by rebels, August 28, 2011)
Abdul Hakim Belhhadj received military training in CIA sponsored guerrilla
camp in Afghanistan. He constitutes a CIA "intelligence asset" in the Lybian
war theater.
An earlier report suggests that he has some
1,000 men under his command.
(Libyan rebels at pains to distance
themselves from extremists - The Globe and Mail, March 12, 2011)
The US-NATO coalition is arming the
Jihadists. Weapons are being channeled to the LIFG from Saudi Arabia,
which historically, since the outset of the Soviet-Afghan war, has
covertly supported Al Qaeda. The Saudis are now providing the rebels, in
liaison with Washington and Brussels, with anti-tank rockets and
ground-to-air missiles.
(See Michel Chossudovsky
"Our Man in
Tripoli" - US-NATO Sponsored Islamic Terrorists Integrate Libya's
Pro-Democracy Opposition, Global Research, 3 April 2011)
A "Democracy" run by
Terrorists
Reports also confirm that large numbers of terrorists imprisoned in Abu
Salim jail were released by rebel forces. They are now being recruited by
the former LIFG Islamic brigades, led by "former" jihadists pro-democracy
commanders.
So all ends well in the smooth transition towards a democracy run by
terrorists.
NATO's Islamic Jihad
There is indications that NATO, in coordination with Western intelligence
agencies (including Israel's Mossad), is involved in recruiting Islamist
fighters.
Israeli intelligence sources confirm that NATO
in cooperation with Turkey, is now directly training and recruiting in
several Muslim countries a new jihadist generation of "Freedom Fighters".
The Mujahideen after undergoing training are slated to participate in NATO's
"pro-democracy" "humanitarian" military campaigns.
The Israeli report by Debka pertains to Syria,
which is next in line on the NATO military roadmap:
"Our sources report, is a [NATO] campaign to
enlist thousands of Muslim volunteers in Middle East countries and the
Muslim world to fight alongside the Syrian rebels..."
(Debka File August 15, 2011
http://www.debka.com/article/21207/)
The NATO led invasion and occupation of Libya is
using Islamic fighters as the backbone of an alleged transition to
democracy.
Concluding Remarks
The tragic
events of 9/11 have played a key role in developing a massive
propaganda campaign geared towards justifying a "war on terrorism" directed
against Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda.
In a bitter twist, throughout the Middle East and Central Asia, the Western
military alliance is using Islamic brigades, trained and groomed by the CIA,
MI6 and Mossad, to wage its "Global War on Terrorism".
The war on terrorism constitutes a broad consensus instilled in the minds of
millions of people. What is not known to Western public opinion is that the
West's holy crusade against Islamic terrorism rather than targeting
terrorists actually includes terrorists in his ranks, i.e. Al Qaeda "freedom
fighters" have been integrated into the ranks of US-NATO led military
operations.
Rest assured, in the case of Libya, the rebels are "the good guys": they are
"former" rather than "active" members of Al Qaeda.
The Western media has not reported on NATO war crimes. It has casually
dismissed NATO atrocities: 8000 strike sorties represents more than 50,000
missiles and bombs dropped on the Libyan people.
There are various ways of concealing the truth. From the outset of the air
campaign, the media has denied the existence of a war.
Its causes and
consequences are distorted. In turn, an effective propaganda campaign
requires targeting people's mindset in newspapers, network TV and online.
People must be distracted from an understanding of
the war on Libya.
Atrocities committed by NATO with the support of
the United Nations is
rarely front-page news. How best to camouflage the truth?
By redirecting
news coverage on Libya towards a number of trivial "talking points",
including the size of Gadhafi's swimming pool, his female bodyguards, his
cosmetic plastic surgery, etc.
(The Guardian, August 23, 2011)
Not included in the journalist's "to do list" is the coverage of the three
thousand men, women and children who lost their lives in the course of a
weeklong Blitzkrieg bombing of Tripoli using the most advanced weapons
systems in human history.
Against this background of lies and fabrications, the lives of several
independent journalists including Global Research's Correspondent Mahdi
Darius Nazemroaya trapped in Tripoli were threatened, for saying the truth.
