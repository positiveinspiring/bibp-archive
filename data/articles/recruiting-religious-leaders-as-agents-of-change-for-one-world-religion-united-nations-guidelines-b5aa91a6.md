In its 2009
Guideluines for Engaging Faith-based Organizations (FBOs) As
Agents of Change, the
UNFPA put out specific tricks to reach congregations
unwilling to go along with the UNs population control programs:
UNFPA has found that leaders of faith - and
interfaith - based organizations are open to discussing reproductive
health, if issues are addressed with care and sensitivity.
These agents of change should also be
recruited to protect and promote the overall agenda,
through countering misinformation campaigns
and building social support within the governments for the ICPD
(International Conference on Population and Development).
The ultimate goal of these engagement efforts is
clearly described:
Create a conducive socio-cultural
environment (impacting on behavior, attitudes and practices) to
ultimately promote and mobilize key communities towards achieving the
goals of the ICPD PoA (International Conference on Population and
Development Program of Action) and the MDGs (Millennium Development
Goals).
In the 2003 World Bank publication
Faith in
Conservation - New Approaches to Religions and the Environment, the reason
for this broad set-up is explained in more detail:
We see, do, and are what we think, and what
we think is shaped by our cultures, faiths, and beliefs. This is why one
of the more extraordinary movements of the past few decades began to
take shape.
For if the information of the
environmentalists needed a framework of values and beliefs to make it
useful, then,
-
Where better to turn for allies than to the original
multinationals, the largest international groupings and networks of
people?
-
Why not turn to the major religions of the world?
It was Prince Philip (yes, the same
prince who proclaimed he would like to see himself
reincarnated as a killer
virus in order to snuff out the lion share of humans if he could)
who in 1995 launched The Alliance of Religions and Conservation:
Origin
We may not be surprised at the fact that we find
yet another branch of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha clan at the forefront of
promoting the infiltration of
the worlds religions.
To illustrate exactly how widespread this move
toward a global unified religion is, the announcement goes on:
The National Religious Partnership on the
Environment is an alliance of the,
-
US Catholic Conference
-
Coalition on
Environment and Jewish Life
-
National Council of Churches
-
Evangelical Environmental Network,
...that serves more than 100 million
Americans.
This official launch was preceded by the
emergence of
Interfaith Partnership for the Environment, which was founded
in the mid 1980s in order to, as the UNEP website
teaches,
inform North American congregations about
the serious environmental problems facing life on earth.
We should here insert the observation that, yes,
there is something detrimental facing all life on our planet and it isnt
carbon oxide.
It is called the scientific dictatorship, which
has already infiltrated almost all forms of human organization, including
political, cultural, economic and religious organizations.
The Earth Charter is another example.
An initiative by Steven
Rockefeller (a fourth-generation
member of the family) as well as man-hater
Maurice Strong, the Charter outlines somewhat of an earth worship cult- for
the brain-dead observer in order to attain world peace, but when you take a
closer look youll find traces of eugenics all over the place.
Heres a man so keen on promoting the religion
of death (which lies at the very core of this proposed world religion) that
he couldnt help himself on several occasions shooting his mouth off about
the true objectives that are enshrined within its pillars:
The other tentacle of this global system of control calls itself
the World
Bank and also joins in on the effort.
UNEP explains:
In Mongolia, for example, the World Bank
and other international organizations are sponsoring a project to
translate and publish Buddhist sutras about sacred mountains into modern
Mongolian.
The plan is to use the texts to reconsecrate the mountains
and thus remind the local people of their traditional responsibilities
not to log or hunt in certain areas.
Klaus Töpfer, Executive Director of UNEP, has
went around on many occasions, spreading this religion of death.
On
one such occasion the Executive Director called for the creation of a new
global religion:
We have to develop the ecological, holistic
world view which connects us with the rest of Nature both materially and
spiritually. Religious traditions emphasize this connection.
Our task
should be to retrieve these basic symbols and doctrines within each
tradition and translate them into clear prescription for public policy
and behavior.
In an address to the World Council of Churches, Töpfer first quotes
the Bible:
Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
the earth, and subdue it: and have domination over the fish of the sea,
and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth
upon the earth
Then Töpfer adds:
Did God intend that we would multiply at
the rate of nearly 80 million additional people a year, and be rapidly
approaching a global population of ten billion in the next century
Spoken like a true eugenicist.
The United
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), as the enforcement arm of the overall
infrastructure, joined with their brother- and sister-agencies in the UN to
encircle the worlds religions reminiscent of a pack of hungry wolves:
Since 2002, UNFPA has emphasized the
integration of culturally sensitive approaches into programming efforts.
Toward this end, it has worked closely within communities and with local
agents of change, including religious leaders.
Theres something to remember when you see
preachers on television or radio, emphasizing the need for smaller families
and birth control.
Big chance youre dealing with yet another agent of
change employed by the United Nations to gently lead you into the its desired death
cult.
