Remember death panels?
Theyre baaaaack now that
Obamacare is law of the land.
Before Obamacare became the law of the land, liberals and progressives
went ballistic over Sarah Palins Facebook entry stating an obvious fact -
Obamacare will realize its savings on relegating seniors to sub-standard
health care via rationing.
Libs were outraged and said there was no evidence
the government plans to implement death panels.
Palins assertion was
subsequently deemed lie of the year.
That was then, this is now.
Earlier this week, Health and Human Services
Secretary (and Bilderberg member)
Kathleen Sebelius said Dr.
Donald Berwick
is absolutely the right leader at this time to head up the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services. Obamacare will cut hundreds of billions of
dollars from Medicare over the next decade as the Boomers retire and enter
old age.
Berwick is the right man for the job.
The decision is not whether or not we
will ration care the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes
open, Berwick said while discussing the council for Comparative
Effectiveness Research, which was tasked with researching and evaluating the
cost of medical treatments and their outcomes.
It was part of the $787
billion stimulus package and one of the building blocks
Obama wanted in
place before the health-care takeover bill was passed, writes Jane Chastain.
During debate on Obamacare, mechanisms for rationing embedded in the
legislation were revealed - the Patient Centered Outcomes Research
Institute, the Independent Medicare Advisory board, the CMS Innovation
Center and the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force - but few in the
corporate media paid attention.
Most of them were too busy attacking
criticism of the bill.
Im really pleased that the President nominated Dr. Donald Berwick,
Sebelius gushed.
Hes known nationally as an enormously competent physician
and an enormously passionate health care provider and someone who, I think,
is incredibly well suited to help increase the quality of health care
delivered to the 40-plus million Americans who rely on Medicare services and
also the 30-plus million on Medicaid services.
Dr. Berwick is enamored with the British healthcare system that,
uses
end-of-life death pathways, which withhold expensive treatment in favor of
morphine and hand-holding. Physicians have charged that this leads to
premature death for many British citizens, according to Chastain.
During the debate on the health-care takeover bill, Obama ridiculed those
like [Senator] Roberts who tried to warn us about rationing and Sarah Palin
who used the term death panels. Now that his administration has admitted
that rationing is part of the plan, at the very least, he owes these folks
an apology, writes Chastain.
Apologize? Go fish. No apology will be forthcoming.
Our eugenicist rulers
are determined to eventually
reduce the global population to around 500
million people who will be reduced to robotized slaves. Obamas
deathcare
operation is one small step in this direction.
It is no secret the primary goals of the
Bilderberg Group are a one-world
government, a one-world monetary system and a vast reduction in world
population. In 2009, the billionaires club -
Bill Gates,
David
Rockefeller, Ted Turner, Oprah Winfrey, Warren Buffett,
George Soros and
Michael Bloomberg - gathered in New York to discuss the disastrous
environmental, social and industrial threat your continued existence poses
to the global elite.
Gates and Buffett in particular have donated huge sums
of money for population control.
For
the global elite and their minions, we are contemptible
useless eaters.
Frankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern
about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we dont
want to have too many of, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
admitted last year.
The elite believe they can maintain the facade of a Constitution and Bill of
Rights as they go about decimating world population.
Obamas science czar,
John P. Holdren, said as much when he wrote in EcoScience (page 837):
Indeed, it has been concluded that compulsory population-control laws, even
including laws requiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under the
existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to
endanger the society.
Gates and Buffett have announced the crisis of world population is
sufficiently severe to endanger the society of global elite.
It is no mistake a Bilderberg member is the Secretary of Health and Human
Services. It is also no mistake Obamacare was passed and will be implemented
at the precise moment millions of Baby Boomers enter retirement and old age.
Millions of Boomers - who dutifully paid their taxes including taxes for
Medicare - will suffer the fate of Edward G. Robinson in the 1973 film Soylent Green:
