It is a well-known fact that our society is structured like a pyramid.
The
very few people at the top create conditions for the majority below. Who are
these people? Can we blame them for the problems our society faces today?
Guided by the saying A fish rots from the head we set out to follow that
fishy odor.
What we found out is that people at the top are more likely to
be psychopaths than the rest of us.
Who, or what, is a psychopath? Unlike Hollywoods stereotypical image, they
are not always blood-thirsty monsters from slasher movies. Actually, that
nice lady who chatted you up on the subway this morning could be one. So
could your elementary school teacher, your grinning boss, or even your
loving boyfriend.
The medical definition is simple:
A psychopath is a person who lacks empathy
and conscience, the quality which guides us when we choose between good and
evil, moral or not.
Most of us are conditioned to do good things.
Psychopaths are not. Their impact on society is staggering, yet altogether
psychopaths barely make up one percent of the population.
Through interviews with,
-
renowned psychologist Professor Philip Zimbardo
-
leading expert on psychopathy Professor Robert Hare
-
former President of
Czech Republic and playwright Vaclav Havel
-
authors Gary Greenberg and
Christopher Lane
-
professor Nicholas Christakis,
...among numerous other
thinkers, we have delved into the world of psychopaths and heroes and
revealed shocking implications for us and our society.
