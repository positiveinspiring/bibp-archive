Our whole lives we have been told that we have
freedom, that we live in a democracy, that we the people have the
ability to choose the kind of society in which we want to live.
However, if you ask most Americans what kind of place they want, I guarantee
you that a vast majority would disagree with almost every government action
that has been put forward in their lifetime.
If we truly lived in a free society, we would not be in a half-dozen wars
across the planet; we would not be subject to authoritarian policies such as,
...and the government would not have grown to
become the biggest and most menacing
dictatorship in the history of the
world.
It seems that in the past year these major events have really
resonated with a great number of people, not just in this country, but
throughout the world.
In the past, the oppressed would beg and plead with the very people who were
responsible for their condition because they knew no other way of affecting
change in society. People would ask the government to change their ways
because they were under the impression that those in authority actually
cared about them.
After generations of failing to create change
through politics, people are now shifting the direction of their message
towards one another, instead of pleading with politicians and organizations
that dont care about anyone but themselves.
With the recent protests surrounding
SOPA and
PIPA, we have really seen this
new method of protest becoming more pronounced. Sure, there are still
millions drafting petitions and thousands joining marches and making signs.
However, nowadays these people dont seem to be
petitioning their government; it seems that more and more they are
petitioning their fellow citizens. This is because the government is an
obstacle; one which stands between the people and their freedom. Therefore,
it is completely impossible to solely use the government as a tool to
achieve freedom; this would be like trying to use a hammer to fix a broken
computer, in both cases youre only going to make the problem worse.
Luckily, most Americans have learned all of this just in time for the
pivotal votes this month regarding online privacy.
SOPA and PIPA may seem unimportant when compared
with,
...but if you think about it, without the Internet we
would have an immense amount of difficulty dealing with any of the
aforementioned problems.
Thanks to the Internet, these issues have gone
from taboo subjects to national issues in just a matter of years, which is
the whole reason for the rollout of the SOPA and PIPA acts to begin with.
Many of us sat and watched horrified from our homes,
as
Obama signed the NDAA into law, after he promised us that he wouldnt. With this betrayal
still fresh in the public consciousness, fewer people are downplaying the
authoritarian moves that our government is making, and of those people even
fewer are considering politics as a viable method of achieving social
change.
Today's Internet blackout is a sign of the new political discourse that
has been developing worldwide.
Sure, Ill admit that its going to take a lot
more than a viral web campaign to bring us peace and freedom, but this is
only a sign of things to come, and its a very good omen. Today, over a
thousand websites, including Google and Wikipedia, have either shut down or
have been modified in some way to protest next weeks vote on SOPA.
People are now reaching out to their neighbors and devising methods of
solving the problems that are created by politics, without depending on
politicians to fix them.
In an
article last month, I said that the only
way we will truly win this revolution is if we take matters into our own
hands in a series of small battles where we call the enemies bluff every
time they attempt to assert their illegitimate authority.
Right now is an example of one of those battles,
and considering that I have probably never seen this level of activism and
participation among the general public, I would say that we are at least
moving things in the right direction.
