Start of interview
Kerry: This is David Lawrence Corso and
Robert Duncan O'Finioan.
We have them together on camera for the first time. Your name rank and
serial number. How's that? Do you have one?
Duncan: I don't have one... well, actually I do.
K: [to David] How about you? No?
David: No.
K: No name, rank and... OK.
David: Patriot. Constitutional patriot and Bill of Rights ...
K: And retired ...
David: And retired from the telecommunications industry.
K: OK. We're in Pahrump, Nevada. Right?
David: In my humble home.
K: It's 2007, and we're very happy to be here.
David: I'm delighted that you're here.
K: And you own some amazing ...
David: I admire your courage.
K: Thank you. And you own some amazing wolves? Isn't that right?
David: Native American dogs.
K: [laughs] Native America dogs. All right. Are you part Native American
as well?
David: No, just adopted into the Apache tribe by a family friend.
K: Are you?
David: Yes.
K: Very nice. OK, so what is your connection, right off the bat, with
Duncan?
David: We go back three years, about three or maybe four years ago. A
mutual friend introduced me when he said, I have friends I want you to
meet. And I said, Oh really? So we met up and as soon as I saw John
with Duncan, I knew them.
And it was like an envelope had been opened in my mind, or a doorway if
you would. It took a while for those memories to resurface so I could
figure out where I had saw them - in June of 1967.
We were actually in Cambodia... on a little operation to help get some
American Special Forces troops out of a bad bind. And we were pinned
down by extremely heavy fire when this chopper lands and these twelve
kids get out, look around, join hands, and there was this blinding
flash. They got back in the chopper. And in the doorway of the chopper
was a gentleman in a green uniform, like an Army uniform, fatigues.
And we talked to the Special Forces team later and we asked, What did
you see? And all they saw was a blinding flash. And there had to be at
least 2,000 or more [sighs heavily] Vietcong and North Vietnamese
regulars and Cambodian communists that were just simply dead. And
that's... the only thing I remember of it is the blinding flash.
But
there was this little kid with a huge... white kid with a huge...
Duncan: Afro.
David: Afro, and this little girl, very dark skinned, that was beside
him. And they got on the chopper and just flat disappeared. Well, some
days later I'm in Saigon and there is this gentleman again from the
aircraft. And he didn't introduce himself. He looked at me, I looked at
him, and he turned around and walked away.
But he had an insignia that I
had never seen before on his shoulder.
K: You were Special Forces?
David: I was in a group that didn't exist.
K: What were you called? Green Berets?
David: Black Operations.
K: Do they have a name for your division, or ...?
David: Black Operations.
K: That's it?
David: That's it.
K: Were you ranked in the military before you went into Black
Operations?
David: Uh huh.
K: As what? Are you at liberty to say?
David: Well... officially I was attached to the Navy and my official
Navy record isn't at all like what I was involved with.
K: OK. What does your official Navy record say you were?
David: Oh, it says I'm a radar technician and I went to B-School and I
was on five ships and I was on a swift boat detachment and I made... was
in Vietnam for 14 campaigns.
K: Now... And what is the reality behind that?
David: I wish I could say for sure, but I have memories that are coming
back that I can't explain. But Dunc's already talked to you about
Project Talent.
K: Now, are you feeling that you were part of Project Talent from
another angle?
David: I'll answer that in this manner: When my mother was 87 years old,
I said,
Mother, I have these reoccurring memories of being with my
uncle during the summers.
She looked at me and had this mischievous
grin on her face. [points to photo on wall] And that's her up on the
wall. She said,
You were never with your uncle in the summers. You
were... away, and you'll figure it out as you get older.
K: Is your family patriotic? You know, were they in the service?
David: My brothers served in the Marine Corps. Both brothers did. And I
was assigned to the Marine Corps, but there's no official record of
that.
K: You flashed back on this memory when you met Duncan? Or after you met
Duncan?
David: That memory has come back to me several times, but it... When my
son was 9 years old, he and I went fishing for a month. And we're in the
middle of Strawberry Lake fishing. He's having a tremendously successful
day fishing and of course I'm not catching anything.
And he looks at me
out of the blue and says,
Daddy, what did you do in Vietnam? What did
you really do?
That's the night the nightmares started.
K: Wow. And what kind of nightmares are you talking about?
David: I wish I could tell you but I've talked to my VA counselors many
times and they said, Be glad you don't remember them because what
you're doing is re-fighting battles.
K: OK. But I'm assuming that what part of the nightmare... was seeing
the children in the field. Is this right?
David: That did not happen until... Duncan and I were talking one time
about when we remembered seeing each other. And we remembered the same
incident, literally word for word.
Duncan: But for me, that incident in itself was just like a nightmare. I
remember getting off the chopper. I remember the other eleven kids. And
I remember the blinding flash and I remember getting back on the
chopper. But before the chopper landed, after the chopper took off, I
don't remember anything.
In one particular memory that I have that is very vivid... I was in a
chopper. I was a little older in this one. And we were shot down. I
remember the chopper took off. We didn't get more than 10, 12 feet off
the ground. And we took some kind of fire. I call it anti-aircraft fire
because, to me, if I'm in an aircraft I don't care if it's a .22 or a
90mm howitzer, if you're shooting at me, it's anti-aircraft fire. And we
went down.
And I remember this man here [points to David] dragging me
out of a burning helicopter.
K: [to David] Were you in the helicopter at the time, or were you
nearby?
David: That, unfortunately, I don't have a recollection of.
K: OK.
Duncan: I know he wasn't in the helicopter. I was the only passenger in
the helicopter.
K: OK. You saw these kids in the field. You saw these people die. Do you
know basically how many people you're talking about that were killed?
David: I would have no idea. There was ...
K: Was it, were there villages? I mean, was it a village like ...
David: No. it was not a village.
K: OK.
David: It was in the jungle.
K: OK. And were there women ...
David: And there had to be ...and there was ...
K: ...as well as men?
David: There could have been. We didn't bother to do a body count.
K: No, but I'm just... generally speaking ...
David: What we saw were men.
K: Uh huh. Soldiers, I imagine?
David: Yes.
K: OK.
David: If you want to call ...
K: They were armed, in other words.
David: Oh yes. [laughs]
K: OK. All right. Just trying to get to ...
David: With everybody's favorite weapon, the AK47. Except a few that
were carrying M16s and M14s.
K: All right. OK. So... and this was what year?
David: 1967.
K: And you were there on a Black Operation.
David: Uh huh.
K: OK. And do you have any other memory of that specific incident?
David: [shakes head]. No.
K: That's it?
David: There are memories that are trying to surface that either I am
intentionally blanking or they have been blanked extremely well. Because
we know that the government can implant false memories and wipe out your
memories of your whole, complete life. Now if that happened to me, I
don't know. But my son and I have talked. We were talking about
something entirely different, and all of a sudden I feel a light come
on. But I can't get anything to illuminate with that light.
K: Have you attempted to be regressed?
David: No.
K: Are you worried about the impact on you of these unrecovered...
memories?
David: Bring it on. It's exciting.
K: Oh really? So you're willing... Are you willing to be regressed?
David: I would... I'm very... would be very hard to hypnotize.
K: OK. This is something you know about yourself?
David: Yes.
K: Would you be willing to try it?
David: Sure.
K: Good.
David: As long as it's here.
K: Here in Pahrump, Nevada? Or here in your house?
David: Here in my house.
K: Uh huh. Why is that?
David: This house is a sanctuary for me.
K: OK.
David: I can relax here like I can relax no other place.
K: You said you travel around the United States from time to time. Do
you have memories come back to you when you're traveling?
David: [shakes head No.]
K: Do you feel threatened when you're outside this area in some way?
David: No. What happens is... I have severe post traumatic stress
disorder and I take many precautions to make sure that I'm never in a
place where I can be by myself, at night particularly. Or if I go
somewhere, I meet somebody. But I always have to call when I get home
for them to make sure I got home.
K: Because? What might happen?
David: If I get triggered and I don't have an anchor like Dunc or my
son, I don't know what I would do.
K: Is this because of your memories of Vietnam or because of what you
don't remember about Vietnam?
David: I think it's more because of what I don't remember. Dunc can
relate an incident that he had in... Lexington?... At the coffee shop.
Duncan: Uh huh.
David: He'll relate that later... that I have absolutely no memory of.
K: So, do you have missing time? In your everyday life?
David: Not that I've been able to notice. But I have noticed that if I'm
working on a computer... Time, to me, is meaningless, really. I've
stayed up for days.
K: So you have good concentration ability?
David: I can get absolutely waylaid on things, can't I?
Duncan: [laughing] Oh yeah. [both laugh]
K: OK. You know, I'm going to tell you my impression. You sound like
you're used to giving orders. Were you on a high rank when you were in
the military? Or ...
David: Staff sergeant.
K: Staff sergeant. So thats not that high. Right? In terms of military
hierarchy?
David: No.
K: So I'm just wondering where that might have come from if there's
something... because you said you work with computers. You build them
and rebuild them?
David: Build and repair them.
K: Repair. Does that come from the military, that training?
David: Some of it did.
K: Some of it. Were you in... You were in black projects. So they were
top secret. So you had access to information but you don't remember the
information?
David: None of it.
K: Is it like your memories have been wiped?
David: I would have to say that yes, they wiped memories. Otherwise I
can recall things happening back to when I was three years old.
K: OK. But you can't recall ...
David: There's a lot of time in the service I have to question where I
was and what I was doing. And that just surfaced over the last, well,
since my son was 9. Twenty... He'll be 36. Say, 25, 26 years, I've had
to question, What did I really do?
K: Do you have any idea what you did?
David: Well, it would have to be that I wasn't a nice guy.
K: OK. I'm getting that.
David: And I really don't know.
K: OK.
David: But I have this very vivid memory of Dunc.
K: OK.
David: And memories of seeing John... in Saigon.
Duncan: Uh huh.
David: But there's other memories that I've had corroborated where I was
actually attached to a swift boat base. When the base got hit one time,
I was the last person off the base and I come off a pier, caught on the
life rail which is two feet above the deck which is two feet above the
waterline, caught that, slammed my knees into the transom and they
pulled me up on the boat and I laid and cried for two hours. I have that
memory.
K: Where was that?
David: Quinyon.
K: Where is that?
David: Vietnam.
K: Uh huh.
David: Right in the center of the coast.
K: So, you must have been pretty young at this time, right?
David: Yeah. That happened in 1967, so I'd have been 26.
K: So you came from a military family? Does that ...
David: No. I can from a Sicilian family.
K: Sicilian family? OK. [Duncan laughs] OK. But your family was in the
military?
David: My brothers were.
K: But not your father?
David: My father... No. My father owned a store, a garage, a bakery, two
appliance stores.
K: So your mother said that you were going to remember some things, but
that your memories that you have were not accurate, right?
David: That's correct.
K: But she didn't want to tell you anything else?
David: She just smiled.
K: Did you quiz her?
David: When my mother gave you that smile, you didn't ask questions.
[laughter]
.
K: So what do you think happened? Do you have any idea? I mean... Is
your mother still alive?
David: Unfortunately my mother died in 1993.
K: And you have a friend named John who, I'm assuming was also in the
military with you? Or with Duncan?
David: We're not... He had to be in the military, but we're not sure of
who he was attached to.
Duncan: I ...
K: He has memories. Are his memories clear, or not?
Duncan: Actually no, because he was asking me about some of the things.
And I have vivid memories of being maybe 13, 14, and in a lab-type
setting and John was in uniform. And there was a couple of other
uniforms there as well. And he was basically trying to give me an order.
And I had pushed one of the other kids out of the way and was up in his
face. I mean I was just all over him. And the other guys, the high
ranking people, were just eating it up. I mean, they were laughing their
butts off. 'Cause here's this little 13 year old kid with an afro
halfway down his back up in, you know, a military guy's face just going
to town on him.
And like we talked earlier about putting the puzzle together. We all
have different memories. Some of them are almost identical and some
aren't. And when we set down and we start talking and we put them all
together, then they start to make sense.
K: You guys act like you've known each other forever.
Duncan: Yeah. I know.
David: We have. [laughs]
K: [to David] How long have you been out of the military?
David: Since November... October 15 of 1968.
K: How long have you felt that you didn't have memories?
David: I wasn't aware of that really until my son ...
K: ...asked you that question.
David: ...in 1980.
K: 1980. So, wow. Some time went by before you realized there was a gap.
David: And then I never realized what PTSD [post-traumatic stress
disorder] was about. But looking at it now and with the research I've
done into how it affects me personally, I can look at events that
happened in my life, particularly after I got out, where it affected me
so greatly that it affected my advancement in different companies.
K: How does it manifest?
David: What happens is... What had happened... I would come in my house.
If I felt being triggered, I'd come in my house, close my blinds, close
the drapes, lock the door, bring the dogs in and get my guns out.
K: Oh really. OK.
David: And nothing ever happened.
Duncan: [laughs] I'm not laughing because I think it's funny. I'm
laughing because that's almost exactly what I would do.
K: Oh really. So you have something similar.
Duncan: Yeah, except I didn't have the animals, but I would go into a
room, put a loaded pistol on my desk and just sit in the dark and wait.
K: Wow.
Duncan: Happened numerous times.
David: And what happens is that night I have... I will have nightmares
on more than one occasion. But with my animals, particularly with my...
with this young Native American dog named Herky... He puts his paws on
the bed and licks my face. If he has to come around the other side of
the bed, he'll do it. And because I know he's there as a safety for me,
I can wake up and I say, OK, I'm awake. What was I doing? And
sometimes I get up, there's no clothes on the bed. I mean, they're just
gone. Pillows are gone. They're gone. Dogs are on the floor looking at
me like, What did you do? [laughs]
K: Do you feel like you have special skills that you didn't know you
had, the way Duncan does? 'Cause I see that you collect swords. Do you
know how to use them?
David: Yes.
K: Have you been trained to use them... in your conscious recall?
David: No.
K: Really?
David: [to Duncan] You can ask him.
Duncan: It's identical. There is something that we all seem to share in
common is knowledge of blade weapons, how to use swords, how to use
knives, how to fight with them, defend against them. As a matter of
fact, with the katanna [Japanese word, samurai sword] I've had, to my
memory, to my knowledge, no official training. Yet when I go to a
kinjitsu dojo and work out with one of the instructors, the first thing
they say is, How did you learn to combine two different styles of jinjitsu? And I don't know. Here we go again.
K: [to David] You look pretty... like you were strong. You're still
strong. OK? At this age, whatever age you happen to be.
David: 66.
K: OK. You appear to be a very strong man and I'm just wondering if you
were aware that you might have been unusually strong in your earlier
life.
David: Fear will do that to you.
K: OK.
David: That's the only thing I can say, is fear will do that to you.
K: Uh huh. Because you... OK. Do you know how to defend yourself?
David: Yes.
K: OK. You know how to defend yourself using swords, but you don't know
how you learned it, right?
David: That's correct.
K: I assume you know how to use guns.
David: I have a passing familiarity with weapons. [Duncan laughs]
K: OK. I think you're a master of the understatement, as they say. I'm
getting that.
David: Me?
K: Yeah.
Duncan: I'm not touching that.
K: OK.
David: Want to see my paintball gun? [laughs]
K: You know, I'm not sure I want to see any of your guns, to tell you
the truth. Where did you learn to use the guns? Do you have conscious
recall of that from the military?
David: I recall my brother, my oldest brother, coming home from the
Marine Corps with a .22 target rifle when I was about six. And he taught
me how to shoot. And I just... I got pretty good with it.
K: How good?
David: Good enough that I'm still here.
K: Were you good at targets? You know what I'm saying? Is ..
David: It doesn't matter if the target is a target or a human being.
K: Uh huh.
David: When you're in combat it's like you're up against a 2-dimensional
figure that can kill you. What you think takes an hour might have been
two or three minutes. You become hyper-alert. And I have recalls of
fire-fights that went on. And I'm still here.
K: Do you have... Were you trained as an officer?
David: No. Not to my knowledge.
K: Not to your knowledge. You know how to drive a boat?... I don't
know... or a ship, or, you know ...? [Duncan laughs] What's funny about
that?
David: My father had boats. He had cabin cruisers. He had race boats. I
was raised around boats.
K: OK.
David: I was raised around all kinds of vehicles. There isn't too much I
can't drive.
K: OK. [Duncan laughs]
David: I don't pilot a plane worth a damn.
K: OK.
David: I've never had a desire to pilot a plane or helicopters. [both
laugh]
K: OK. You go to movies, right?
David: No.
K: Oh, you don't. You're like Duncan. You don't go to movies ...
David: I don't watch war movies. I don't watch adventure movies. Because
that triggers.
Duncan: Yep.
K: What about underground bases? Do you have any knowledge about that?
David: I have... No. But I have heard from more than one source that you
can go from the coast by Los Angeles almost to the middle of the country
in a submarine.
K: You were in the military but your skill is in the computer world ...
David: No. I really didn't get... I got acquainted with computers when I
was in the service.
K: OK.
David: At that time my forte happened to be electronics, electronic
warfare, intelligence. [smiles and pauses, considering]
K: What? What's crossing your mind right now that you don't want to talk
about?
David: Oh, nothing important.
K: OK. Now, are you... have you signed a secrecy oath of any kind? To
your knowledge.
David: No, but I probably did.
K: Do you recall anything that's top secret that you're not saying or
that you don't tell people?
David: Oh, outside of that I intercepted and identified a lot of signals
as to platform when I was in the service. Electronic warfare was what I
was really good at. I could hear a signal across the room and tell you
what it was, and if I knew what part of the country, I could probably
say what platform it was on.
K: Hmm. Interesting. What about
psychotronic warfare?
David: [very somberly] It's a very real thing.
K: Do you think you were involved in that?
David: I almost would have had to have been. But do I have any memories
of it? No.
K: But you think you're knowledgeable about it. [Duncan laughs]
David: I'd say I was knowledgeable about it.
K: OK. When you heard Duncan's story, does it trigger something in you?
David: At times it will. What's interesting is we both have experienced
psychic attacks, and I mean, just vicious attacks, to where they will
keep us up for days.
K: Are you psychic?
David: Where were you at a quarter to two, Tuesday? [Very long pause, no
answer from Kerry] What part... where were you geographically at a
quarter of two?
K: Um... pretty close by. [looks off camera] We were getting here,
weren't we?
David: How close were you to Shoshone?
K: We were in Shoshone at one point.
Duncan: You drilled it. OK, you drilled it.
David: I said, They're very close. They're in Shoshone. [Kerry nods
head yes.] At a quarter of two I walked out.
K: So you're saying .... Have you studied remote viewing?
David: No.
K: To your knowledge, have you studied remote viewing?
David: No.
K: And is it frustrating to you, not to know what happened to you?
David: No.
K: It's not?
David: And let me tell you why it's not. I believe that those memories
will be revealed when the proper time comes to me, or if I dig enough. I
keep myself busy with my dogs, my wolves, and computers and I have good
friends who know me. They don't always understand me, and that's not
important to them.
K: Now you have memories that you've shared but you don't know what they
were. They were, surrounded, Vietnam and... Anything else besides
Vietnam?
Duncan: St. Thomas.
David: St. Thomas.
K: St. Thomas.
David: We had to go down to St. Thomas on business. And we're walking up
through the market place and there's an island off St. Thomas that we
both knew.
Duncan: Uh huh.
David: And as we were walking in the marketplace, this woman looked at
Duncan and said, I haven't seen you in many years, and I haven't seen
you in about 20.
K: Wow. So you were both recognized.
David: Yes.
Duncan: Yep.
David: By more than one person.
K: Wow.
David: And that... We talked about it and I had no conscious
recollection of any of these people. And we looked at this island and I
said, On the other side of that is a training base.
Duncan: Uh huh. And there was.
David: And there was.
K: What military occupied it?
David: We're not sure.
Duncan: We're not sure.
K: Really.
Duncan: Honestly I don't think it was standardized military.
David: No. It was... Our best guess would be that there is a group
within the military that engages totally in psychological warfare, psy
warfare.
K: St. Thomas. You don't know what kind of military or black projects
are going on there now?
David: No. But I have noticed that I've been on battlefields in many
parts of the world. And I can walk across those battlefields and I can
experience and hear in my mind... It was like... which was pointed out
to me when a friend and I were walking Pickett's Charge in Gettysburg
and I looked Lynn and Lynn had looked at me and we were both crying
because it was so... War is such a pitiful thing, caused by bankers to
enrich companies and themselves. There's never been one logical reason
for a war. Not one. And the war on terrorism, to me, is a farce. It's
about controlling this country and setting it up for the New World
Order.
K: You're an electronics expert. Do you think you're being watched or
tapped into?
David: There's no doubt in my mind. And you know what? I really don't
care.
K: Do you find yourself knowing things you didn't know you knew, in
terms of electronics?
David: [looks at Duncan and laughs]
Duncan: Yes.
David: I would like to understand all that I know.
