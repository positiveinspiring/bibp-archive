# NSA Director Defends Plan to Maintain 'Backdoors' Into Technology 
Companies

The National Security Agency (NSA)
director, Mike Rogers, on Monday sought to calm a chorus
of doubts about the government's plans to maintain built-in
access to data held by US technology companies, saying such "backdoors"
would not be harmful to privacy, would not fatally compromise
encryption and would not ruin international markets for US
technology products.
Rogers mounted an elaborate defense
of
Barack Obama's evolving cybersecurity strategy in an
appearance before an audience of cryptographers, tech company
security officers and national security reporters at the New
America Foundation in Washington.
In an hour-long question-and-answer
session, Rogers said a cyber-attack against Sony pictures by
North Korea last year showed the urgency and difficulty of
defending against potential cyber threats.
"If you look at the topology of
that attack from North Korea
against Sony Pictures Entertainment, it literally
bounced all over the world before it got to California,"
Rogers said.
"Infrastructure located on
multiple continents, in multiple different geographic
regions."
For most of the appearance, however,
Rogers was on the defensive, at pains to explain how legal or
technological protections could be put in place to ensure that
government access to the data of US technology companies would
not result in abuse by intelligence agencies.
The White House is trying to broker
a deal with companies such as Apple, Yahoo and Google, to ensure
holes in encryption for the government to access,
-
mobile data
-
cloud computing
-
other data
"'Backdoor' is not the context I
would use, because when I hear the phrase 'backdoor' I
think: 'Well this is kind of shady, why wouldn't you want to
go in the front door, be very public?'" Rogers said.
"We can create a legal framework
for how we do this."
Rogers, who is also commander of
US Cyber Command, said the
government was playing catch-up not only in establishing
defenses against cyber attacks but in laying out its own rules
of cyber warfare, including when retaliation was appropriate.
"We're not mature and we're
clearly not where we need to be," Rogers said.
"Take the nuclear example. If
you go back in the first 10, 20 years, we were still
debating about, 'Well, what are the fundamental concepts of
deterrence?'
This whole idea of mutually
assured destruction - that didn't develop in five years, for
example. All of that has taken time. Cyber is no different."
Rogers admitted that concerns about
US government infiltration of US companies' data represented a
business risk for US companies, but he suggested that the
greater threat was from cyber-attacks.
"I think it's a very valid
concern to say 'Look, are we losing US market segment
here?'" Rogers said.
"What's the economic impact of
this? I just think, between a combination of technology,
legality and policy, we can get to a better place than we
are now."
US technology companies have bridled
at government pressure to introduce weaknesses in encryption
systems in order to ensure government access to data streams,
and technical experts have
warned that there is no way to create a "backdoor" in an
encryption system without summarily compromising it.
An appearance by Obama at a
cybersecurity conference at Stanford University last week to
tout cooperation between the government and US tech companies
was upstaged by an impassioned speech by Apple's chief
executive, Tim Cook, who
warned of the "dire consequences" of sacrificing the right
to online privacy.
The basic discomfort of the new
partnership the government would like to see with technology
companies once again burst into full view on Monday when
Alex Stamos, the chief information security officer at
Yahoo, challenged Rogers on his recommendation for built-in,
"defects-slash-backdoors, or golden master keys" to serve
government purposes.
Stamos asked Rogers how companies
such as Yahoo, with 1.3 billion users worldwide, would be
expected to reply to parallel requests for backdoors from
foreign governments, and told Rogers such backdoors would be
like "drilling a hole through a windshield".
"I've got a lot of world-class
cryptographers at the National Security Agency," replied
Rogers, skipping over the question of foreign government
requests.
"I think that this is
technically feasible. Now it needs to done within a
framework."
