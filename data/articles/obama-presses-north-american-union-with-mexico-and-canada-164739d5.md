President
Obama's February 19 meeting in Toluca,
Mexico, with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper (right) and
Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto (center) did not produce any
big, headline-grabbing breakthroughs, but that does not mean that it didn't
lay new ground for political and economic integration of the three nations.
In fact, in their
Joint Statement issued at the conclusion of the summit, the three
leaders affirmed their commitment to a number of initiatives, many of which
are already far developed, including approval of
the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the "trade" agreement that is stirring
widespread opposition in all three countries.
The controversial TPP is evoking broad-spectrum
hostility particularly because of the
total secrecy under which it has been crafted; while the American public
and even the U.S. Congress have been kept from seeing the text, privileged
corporations and NGOs have been given full access to the negotiated
documents.
The portions of the agreement that have been
publicly leaked have confirmed that it poses a serious threat to national
sovereignty, both from international institutions (such as the United
Nations and the WTO) as well as multi-national corporations.
The Joint Statement unequivocally endorses the TPP, declaring:
We seek to set new standards for global trade
through the prompt conclusion of a high standard, ambitious, and
comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership.
This is similar to the language of the
Joint Statement issued by Obama, Harper, and then-President of Mexico
Felipe Calderon at the 2012 Summit of North American Leaders, which
declared:
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) provides an
opportunity to further deepen our trade relationship and create jobs. The
United States welcomes Canada's and Mexico's interest in joining the TPP as
ambitious partners.
The TPP is an attempt to forge a supranational
government for the nations of the Pacific Rim modeled after the European
Union.
There are currently 12 members of the TPP:
-
United States
-
Mexico
-
Canada
-
Australia
-
Brunei Darussalam
-
Chile
-
New
Zealand
-
Peru
-
Singapore
-
Vietnam
-
Malaysia
-
Japan
The TPP represents the latest attempt of the
globalists in the Washington ruling elite to greatly expand the power and
reach of 20-year-old NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Following the example of the European Union,
they are pursuing a twin path of "broadening and deepening."
Broadening refers to the process of adding new
member nations; deepening refers to the process of greater and greater
"integration" and "harmonization," the progressive convergence and
intertwining of economic, political, and social sectors of the individual
countries into a regional government, over which the citizens and their
elected officials would have less and less control and accountability.
Eventually, the various supranational regional
governments would be merged into a world government under the,
...and other
UN-related agencies.
Following the establishment of NAFTA in 1994,
under the Clinton administration, President
George W. Bush attempted to deepen the U.S.-Canada-Mexico
tri-national region with the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP),
but public opposition spearheaded by,

The John Birch Society
-
WorldNetDaily
-
Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum
-
other
pro-independence, pro-Constitution groups,
...forced the Bush administration
to shelve the plan - temporarily - and drop the tainted SPP moniker.
At the same time, the Bush administration was
pushing the broadening agenda, under the banner of the Free Trade Area of
the Americas (FTAA),
an endeavor launched during the Clinton administration to expand NAFTA to
include all the nations of North and South America.
As with the SPP, an awakened electorate put
sufficient heat on the U.S. Congress to torpedo the FTAA.
The subversive integration/merger plans that
The New American had been exposing for years were confirmed in 2011
with the release by WikiLeaks of U.S. State Department cables showing that
U.S. officials had been colluding with their Canadian and Mexican
counterparts to undermine our constitutional government through various
"integration" schemes. (See

CFR Handprints on Every
Page - No Surprise There
As with NAFTA and all of the other myriad "free
trade" agreements that have flooded out of the current Obama administration
and the Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II administrations, the actual
fountainhead for the texts continues to be the Council on Foreign Relations
(CFR) and its allied think tanks and media spigots.
Carla A. Hills, a top CFR insider, is but one of the brain trust's key operatives promoting the
TPP.
In testimony on January 15, Hills laid out the CFR line on the TPP as a
broadening-deepening upgrade to NAFTA.
Her statement before the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere,
entitled, "NAFTA at Twenty, Accomplishments, Challenges, and the Way Forward,"
called for more U.S. integration with Canada and Mexico, while moving
forward with the TPP (of which Mexico and Canada are already partners) and
also bringing Canada and Mexico into the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership (TTIP) currently underway to merge the United States and EU into
a super-regional bloc.
Hills, a co-chair of the CFR board of directors, told
the subcommittee:
In 2012 Mexico and Canada joined the United
States and eight other nations to negotiate a Trans-Pacific Partnership ("TPP")
to link the Asia and Pacific regions.
Having our two neighbors at the table
will better enable us to take positions to maintain and advance the unique
competitiveness of the North American Region. It also gives us an attractive
opportunity to address issues that were not relevant when the NAFTA was
negotiated...
It also provides an opportunity to harmonize a
number of conflicting trade rules... Today there are eight existing bilateral
trade agreements between the three NAFTA governments and other TPP
participants that were negotiated after the NAFTA came into being
These
differences could be dealt with in the TPP agreement.
Then, on to the push for the TTIP.
According to
Hills:
Third and most importantly, a North
American-European Union Trade Agreement.
Last year the United States and the
European Union's 28 states launched a comprehensive Trans-Atlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership ("T-TIP"). The third round of negotiations occurred
this past December.
Without question the T-TIP is a very big deal
Failure to include Canada and Mexico in T-TIP would erode the unique and
hugely beneficial economic integration that we have achieved with our two
neighbors as a result of the NAFTA.
Carla Hills is one of the big movers and shakers
in globalist circles.
Besides being a longtime CFR officer and current
co-chair of the organization (along with Robert Rubin, former U.S. treasury
secretary and former co-chair of Goldman Sachs), she is also chair and CEO
of Hills & Company (her international consulting firm), a member of the
executive committees of
the Trilateral Commission and the International
Crisis Group, and an attendee of the secretive
Bilderberg Group meetings.
The biography for Hills on the official U.S. Department of State website
dated March 12, 2012
says:
Over the past 25 years Mrs. Hills has served on
a number of corporate boards of directors. She currently serves on the
International Boards of J.P. Morgan Chase, Rolls Royce, and the Coca-Cola
Company and is a member of the Board of Gilead Sciences.
Mrs. Hills is also
actively involved with a number of eleemosynary organizations, serving as
Co-Chair of the Council on Foreign Relations, of the Inter American
Dialogue, and of the International Advisory Board of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies; Chair of the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations
among others.
Hills was also a member of the CFR's
high-powered Independent Task Force that produced the 2005 report entitled
Building a North American Community, a full-throated call for
continental merger.
Robert Pastor (CFR member), frequently cited as "the father of the North
American Union," was the principal co-chair of that task force; he is the
author of the 2001 book, Toward a North American Community, and the
2011 book, The North American Idea: A Vision of a Continental Future,
both of which promote the CFR program of hemispheric integration.
Pastor,
who passed away recently, gained infamy for subversive activities during the
Carter administration, working under national security advisor
Zbigniew
Brzezinski, and also working closely with the radical-Marxist
Institute for
Policy Studies (IPS).
Pastor and Carla Hills were also among the
current and former U.S. officials that attended a
secret
conference in Banff, Alberta, in 2006 to discuss continental merger
plans with foreign counterparts.
The U.S. participants included,
-
Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
-
former Secretary of State George Shultz (CFR)
-
former Central Intelligence Agency Director R. James Woolsey (CFR)
-
former
Immigration and Naturalization Services Director Doris Meissner (CFR)
-
former Defense Secretary William Perry (CFR),
...and others.
Exposure of that
secret meeting and the SPP stealth agenda to surreptitiously carry forward
the transnational merger in violation of the U.S. Constitution, and without
the knowledge and consent of the American people, caused another firestorm
that helped stop the SPP version of the NAU.
However, that did not mean "game over"; the
globalists merely shifted gears, changed their game-plan labels, and rotated
in some new players.
As we
reported concerning the Obama TTIP-TPP program:
Heading up Team Obama's official TTIP effort is
U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman (CFR), who is described in his
official USTR bio as,
"President Obama's principal advisor, negotiator and
spokesperson on international trade and investment issues."
Froman's chief
deputy at USTR is Miriam Sapiro (CFR).
Leading the effort with Froman is
undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment
(and longtime Washington insider) Robert D. Hormats (CFR).
Froman and
Hormats have been busy for months lining up top-level support for TTIP in
speeches before business, banking, and industry groups. They are both Wall
Street insiders. Froman was a managing director at Citigroup, and also
served as president and chief executive officer of CitiInsurance before
joining the Obama administration.
Hormats was vice chairman of Goldman Sachs
International. Both men were principals in massive corruption scandals (Froman
in the bailout of Citigroup, Hormats in PetroChina's takeover of Sudan's
oil).
The late Admiral Chester Ward was a longtime CFR
member who became one of its most notable critics.
According to Adm. Ward,
the goal of the CFR's leaders is the,
"submergence of U.S. sovereignty and
national independence into an all-powerful
one-world government."
James Perloff's definitive book on the CFR,
'The Shadows of Power
- The Council
on Foreign Relations and the American Decline,' together with numerous
articles in this magazine over the years, has shown Admiral Ward's
evaluation of the organization to be spot-on.
