Many questions are arising about what direction the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela and Latin America will take now that Hugo Chavez has died
of cancer.
The answer seems to be that the trend towards
regional autonomy and populism in what academics would call a question of,
either imagined or real, multi-dimensionality and agency will continue.
This is more than just about the so-called pink
tide. It is about anti-hegemonic alliances that have brought different
groups together in Latin America.
The work of
Antonio Gramsci, the Italian activist
and the leader of the Factory Councils in Turin, can help us
conceptualize this process. Not only did Gramsci inspire Chavez, but his
ideas can be used to explain these alliances.
Despite alienating much of what can be called the Venezuelan middle class,
Hugo Chavez campaigned to form united fronts, domestically and
internationally, during his presidency.
From the start, he burst into Venezuelas
political scene with a mixed coalition of activists, a spectrum of leftists,
career soldiers, and small capital.
He tried to bring the mosaic of different
peoples that represented Venezuelan society together formatively. Even when
the middle class was being distanced from his Bolivarianism as it
radicalized, Chavez admitted that it was of high importance to align with
them.
As part of a larger cultural project, this
included communicating with them through a politics of what the sociologist
Stuart Hall would call articulation.
Bolivarian Historic
Bloc Building
In the context of class hegemony, the coalition Chavez built is what Antonio
Gramsci would describe as a process of historical bloc building.
This bloc building process is part of a
continuous war of maneuver and continuous war of position for hegemony. In
June 2007, Chavez would even refer to his Bolivarian Revolution in Gramscian
terms as a bloc building process during a speech he delivered to his
supporters.
He would tell his supporters that they were
witnessing the formation of a new historical bloc and that a historic crisis
was unfolding with the dying of the old, capitalist society of the Republic
of Venezuela (or the Venezuelan Fourth Republic) and the formation of the
new, socialist society of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
Bloc formation has not only been important for Chavezs Bolivarian project.
If not all of them, historic bloc formation has been an important part of
the vast spectrum of social movements; this is why the scholar Peter
Thomas refers to Gramscis work on historical blocs as leading to a
theory of social power for various social movements.
In Some
Aspects of the Southern Question, Gramsci emphasizes that the
factory workers movement in Northern Italy could not position itself for the
leadership of the Italian state without the creation of a historic bloc with
the peasants of Southern Italy.
This alliance was the real magic formula for
taking over the state according to Gramsci and not a division of land and
estates for the peasantry as the socialists claimed.
In Venezuelas past, after it declared independents, on July 4, 1811, it was
defeated by Spanish royalists who convinced the slaves and poorest strata of
Venezuelan society to align with them against Simon Bolivars
republican patriots.
After the defeat of what is called the
Venezuelan First Republic, a Venezuelan Second Republic would be established
in 1814.
This too would be defeated, because the poor and
slaves would oppose the republicans. Bolivar would realize that slavery had
to be abolished and that he needed to form a historic bloc with the slaves
and lower strata to become successful.
In the case of Chavez and other socialists in
Latin America this has also included sectors of local capital.
Bolivarian Historic
Bloc Building in Neo-Gramscian Terms
The political shift in Venezuela can also be analyzed in terms of an
organic, Gramscian historical crisis unfolding in Latin America.
This includes an indigenization of and a
localization of political decision making in Latin America. To a degree, the
transformations in Venezuelan society can be viewed in microcosm as the
transformations in Latin America.
Behind this transformation is a populist drive
aimed at establishing regional autonomy for both socialist movements and
local capital, which also explains the strange alliances of Latin American
governments that support neo-liberalism, like Argentina and Brazil, with
Venezuela.
In the context of hegemony at an international relations level, neo-Gramscians
would also use a term like bloc building to describe the alliances that
Latin America has formed with countries like Russia and Iran. This united
front concept has led to pragmatic alliances.
An example is the Honduran President Jose
Manuel Zelayas alliance with Venezuela and ALBA, even though Zelaya was
relatively right-wing. This again is tied to the common platform of regional
autonomy that is serving to
unit left-wing and right-wing governments in Latin
America.
Chavez made Venezuela pursue a regional agenda as an anti-hegemonic force
working to reduce the regional influence of the United States. Just as Simon
Bolivar realized, while in exile in Jamaica in 1815, that Venezuelas
freedom could only be attained through a hemispheric pan-Latin American
project, so did Chavez.
This is why both adopted historic bloc building
agendas regionally and internationally.
Both realized that a broader struggle or broader
struggles were being reflected locally and that networking with others
struggling against the same enemy was important. This is what got Bolivar to
get the British to be neutral and what has led to Venezuelas modern
alliances with China, Belarus, Iran, and Russia.
Regionally, Bolivar built an alliance with the Haitians, who armed him in
exchange for a promise to free all the slaves he came across, whereas Chavez
has formed the regional organization ALBA and aligned Venezuela with Cuba,
Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua.
In 2005, the humiliation of the US government at
the Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas through the rejection of the
Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA/ALCA) is an example of the
combined success of bloc building and the rising demand for regional
autonomy by Latin Americas socialist movements and capital.
The Bolivarian
Cultural Mission
Social movements would be handicapped without bloc formations or a politics
of articulation that aims to secure consent for their leadership by
convincing the greater part of society to support them.
This struggle for power, which sits at the heart
of the Gramscian notion of hegemony, is also tied to a cultural and
educational project that needs the intelligentsia. The media and
intellectuals are important parts of this.
Chavez also reached out to many Venezuelan intellectuals and brought them
into his administration.
This too has Gramscian contours.
-
Firstly, intellectuals are the
representatives of culture
-
Secondly, organic intellectuals work as
the agents and officers of their classes
-
Thirdly, intellectuals act to organize
the structure(s) of society within the realms of the private and
public
Gramsci believed that every person through their
faculty of reasoning was an intellectual and that there was no such thing as
a non-intellectual.
What defines an intellectual in the Gramscian
sense is an intellectuals immediate social function as a professional or
specialist in a society.
Moreover, he categorized intellectual within a
typology of two: organic and traditional.
-
The organic intellectual is the
representative of its class which works for its collective benefit.
-
The traditional intellectuals are
specialists who are not directly involved in class politics; they
supposedly circumvent it.
Thus, organic intellectuals play important roles
in the process of establishing hegemony or creating anti-hegemonic movements
as functionaries of a specific group and its interests. It is through them
that the dominant ideology in a society is constructed.
Without intellectuals the lower strata that form the mass of society will
not give their consent to a societys ruling class either. In the context of
class, this is why Gramsci explains that one of the most important tasks of
a struggle for empowering itself is to effectively assimilate and win over
the traditional intellectuals and turn them into that struggles organic
intellectuals.
Gramsci wrote that it was of importance to break
the bond between the intellectuals and peasantry in Southern Italy, because
the traditional intellectuals deceitfully kept the peasantry passive and in
check under capitalist exploitation for the big landlords, banks, and North
Italian capital.
Chavezs Bolivarian project has also tried to do
this.
The cultural aspects of Chavezs project are also tied to a politics of
articulation, which included his special talk show. Chavez managed to get
his message out to the masses that Bolivarianism was working for their
interest.
This uprooted the articulation of the old elite
just enough to allow Chavez to break their ideological dominance in
Venezuelan society. This has additionally polarized Venezuelan society, as
two cultural projects are competing for hegemony in society.
Simon Rodriguez, the teacher of Chavezs hero Simon Bolivar, said
that,
the people that illuminate humanitys
horizons are not born when they see the light of the world, they are
born when they begin to radiate their own inner light onto the world.
Hate or love the late Hugo Chavez, he has served
as a vanguard for Latin American autonomy and helped countries like
Argentina pay off their debts to
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The process he led in Venezuela has allowed much
of Latin America to marshal itself against Washington.
