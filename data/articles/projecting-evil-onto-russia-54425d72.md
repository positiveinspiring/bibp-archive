Projection is a defense
mechanism that involves taking our own unacceptable qualities or feelings
and ascribing them to other people.
People defend themselves against unpleasant
impulses by denying their existence in themselves, while attributing them to
others. A spouse may be angry at their significant other for not listening,
when in fact it is the angry spouse who does not listen.
When we project our own ego patterns, feelings
or motives onto others, we are accusing them of something or seeing
something in them that is really truer of ourselves.
Projection is usually the result of a
lack of insight and acknowledgement of one's own motivations and feelings.
American leaders have no self-insight and do not
acknowledge their own evil motivations, not in public at least, so they love
to project whatever they want and we see this in full display in their
recent attacks against Russia.
The projection of one's negative qualities onto
others is a common process in everyday life and lately the American
government and media are taking this process to a height perhaps never seen
before.
Projection is the misattribution of a person's
undesired thoughts, feelings or impulses onto another person who does not
have those thoughts, feelings or impulses. Sometimes, in what can be
considered a semi-projection we see in others something that is true in them
and in us at the same time.
Now though there is much to love about Russia no
one is saying their government is saintly but they have stopped their
massive assault on the world of others while America is pushing as hard as
it can to obtain full dominance over everyone in the world they possibly
can.
Psychological projection is a defense mechanism
people subconsciously employ in order to cope with difficult feelings or
emotions.
In the case of American and English officials
and the media conglomerates that back them, it is not just difficult
feelings and emotions it is outright outrageous insanity.
Paul Craig Roberts, an official from the
Regan administration says it this way,
"The kind of reckless lies and transparent
propaganda that comprises The Economist's story has no other purpose
than to
drive the world to war. The Western
elites and governments are not merely totally corrupt, they are insane.
As I have previously written, don't expect to live much longer."
Those very crazy people in Washington are
risking life on planet earth with nuclear war and they are so crazy and sick
that they do not care.
I remember when I was younger looking at the
ugly unhappy faces of communist leaders. Now I see those former monsters
reincarnated on American leader's faces but they are much better at smiling
thus hiding their evil.
Murderous monsters they are so much so they must
hate their own children because they risk having nuclear warheads drop on
their heads. Sick stupid bastards is a description that only warms us up to
what they really are.
Psychological projection involves projecting
undesirable feelings or emotions onto someone else, rather than admitting to
or dealing with the unwanted feelings.
Those who hold the reins of power in the west
would rather die than admit or even perceive their feelings of aggression
and tendency to murder others as something that is unwanted. Just the
opposite.
They want to kill. They want to destroy.
Roberts writes,
"The extraordinary propaganda being
conducted against Russia by the US and UK governments and Ministries of
Propaganda, a.k.a., the 'Western media,' have the purpose of driving the
world to war that no one can win."
This is the same as saying that their purpose is
to risk hundreds of millions if not billions of lives. Obviously there are
people who want to do this even if their own children die in the process.
This transformation of America into a place
where evil rules the roost in Washington and on Wall Street has taken over a
century and has been implemented in such an incremental manner as to be
mostly imperceptible to the public at large. It began with the creation of
the Federal Reserve which is a privately owned central bank owned by
multi-century banking families.
Evil is not new in the world but today it
is taking outrageous proportions killing people right and left with modern
sophisticated weapons.
Chris Martenson writes,
"For reasons that have no rational
explanations at this time, the US and Europe have embarked on a
concerted program to demonize Putin, ostracize Russia, and bring the
world as close to a major conflict as it's been since the Cold War, a
time hardly memorable to many in the current crop of our elected
officials.
Within hours of the MH-17 plane crash, the
United States pinned the blame on Russia generally, and Putin
particularly. The anti-Putin propaganda (and if there were a stronger
term I'd use it) has been relentless and almost comically over-the-top.
Nearly two weeks later, neither the US nor
Europe has provided substantial evidence of any sort to support their
assertions that Ukrainian separatists and/or Russia are to blame for the
MH-17 catastrophe. There's literally been nothing."
Few people in the west understand the danger.
Rob Kerby says,
"The chaos
is planned because the architects of the chaos are the globalists.
The globalists have a little saying: 'out of
chaos will come order.'
So, what they do is whip up animosity and fear
and play groups off of one another. The goal of the globalist,
ultimately, is to have one world government, one world currency and one
world religion. The whole idea of globalism is to first round countries
into regional blocks and then merge the blocks into one super country.
These people have contempt for humanity, and
they have stated their contempt for humanity. They want to
reduce the world population by
something of a factor of 80-90%. These globalists have taken
control of the U.S., Canada, most of Western Europe and the United
Kingdom.
These people are dangerous, and these people
are seemingly taking the work to the brink."
These people are serious and have built an
expensive monument toward their goals.
They are seriously evil and
extremely rich and can hardly be called human.
On one of the highest hilltops in Elbert County,
Georgia stands a huge granite monument.
Engraved in eight different languages on the
four giant stones that support the common capstone are 10 Guides, or
commandments. That monument is alternately referred to as
The Georgia Guidestones, or the American
Stonehenge.
Though relatively unknown to most people, it is
an important link to the Occult Hierarchy that dominates the world in which
we live.
THE MESSAGE OF THE GEORGIA GUIDESTONES
Maintain humanity
under 500,000,000
in perpetual balance with nature,
...and obviously, their chosen method is
to kill off the rest. Not exactly nice people...
It would, of course, be a
good idea for humanity to learn how to limit population growth and learn
to live within the means of the resources we have on our planet.
