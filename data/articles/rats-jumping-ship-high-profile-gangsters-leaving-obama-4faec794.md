Just days after mafia boss Barack Obama
was re-elected to his throne, several of his key foot soldiers appear to be
jumping ship from his Administration.
Obama will be hard pressed to fill these
positions with such obedient thugs.
The first confirmed departure,
CIA Director James Petraeus, was likely
forced out. People in high profile positions don't usually tell the ugly
truth about why they are resigning unless the mafia has dirt on them.
Petraeus cited an extra-marital affair as the reason for stepping down.
Usually this type of activity is overlooked by
the mafia as normal behavior, but apparently Petraeus has some personal
integrity.
"In his mind, in his views, with his code of
ethics and morals, he did a very dishonorable thing," said a U.S.
military official and long-time aide to Petraeus.
"This had nothing to do with Benghazi,
nothing to do with his relationship with the White House."
Translation: It had everything to do with his refusal to take part in the Benghazi cover up.
Petraeus will be remembered for:
Petraeus will likely land a multi-million-dollar
job on the board of one or more weapons manufacturers.
The next rat rumored
to be leaving his office is
Attorney General Eric
Holder.
Holder will be most remembered for:
Holder is expected to go back to his
multi-million-dollar career defending the big banks and lobbying for more
bailouts.
Obama's rival underboss,
Hillary Clinton, is
expected to 'step down' as Secretary of State when the second term begins.
Rumor is that she is gearing up to become the next mafia boss in 2016.
Hillary's reign as Secretary will not be
forgotten:
Clinton certainly has displayed the cold heart
necessary to run the mob.
This was no more evident than when she gloated
after having murdered Gaddafi in a cold-blooded
assassination plot:
"We
came, we saw, he died."
This type of diplomacy would make the
legendary
gangsters Bush and Cheney blush.
Because of Clinton's stellar performance for the global mafia, she'll likely
have her choice of jobs in the future whether it be the,
Yes these shoes will be hard to fill, indeed.
But we can rest assured that the mafia has been
breeding and training several adequate replacements.
