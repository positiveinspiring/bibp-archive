The Amero Coin, one North American currency back in the 1980's when the U.S.
and Canada signed the Free Trade Agreement the two countries might have
agreed to something else other than trade of goods.
Some people believe that the Progressive Conservative government of Canada,
sold Canada down the river to the American's by agreeing to a unified
currency called the Amero.
Under the Amero,
-
Canada
-
United States
-
Mexico,
...would use one currency
similar to the what the European Union has done with the Euro.
Also, under
this new "Amero" currency the hope is to have the U.S. Central Bank control
this currency and this is where it gets scary.
If you have watched enough documentaries on how the American Government and
Central Bank manage their money... uhmm you would not want them to manage this
unified currency for all three countries (Canada, U.S. and Mexico).
The U.S. is currently trillion of dollars in debt, and to have the U.S. manage
the currency would be suicide as the American dollar now is near an all time
low.
No offense, but the U.S. government cannot even manage their own economy
right now.
In any case, this new Amero currency, has not been set in stone just yet.
First, whoever is the proponent of this idea is, will have to get all three
countries to agree and I don't think it will happen. Or maybe it already
has, but all three governments are keeping a tight wrap on the secret.
