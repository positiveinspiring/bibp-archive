Despite the truly horrifying nature of the theme
covered in Mel Gibson's 2006 blockbuster film
Apocalypto: namely the manner
by which innocent, defenseless people are hunted down, captured and later
used as human sacrifices in appeasing the
Mayan god Kukulkan.
Nevertheless what made
the film's bloody theme and presentation sufferable was the (mistaken)
notion that it was a thing of the past and not of the present
'Indeed,' so the prevailing wisdom goes
'we're waaaay past that
old hat
yesteryear
passe'
water under the
bridge and over the dam
'
The problem with this assessment of course is
that it's as disconnected from reality as the notion that the earth is flat
or that babies arrive from heaven via some delivery service known as Stork
Express.
Despite not being recognized as such per se,
nevertheless human sacrifice is alive and well, kicking and screaming in
fact - no pun intended - moreso now than at any other time in human history.
And not just the practice itself, but the reasons for doing so as well.
Now - as then - it involves primitive peoples -
barely-humanoid in many respects - who've worked out a business arrangement
with some bad-tempered deity whereby ripping to pieces innocent people
results in rivers of good fortune flowing in their direction, again, no pun
intended
In short time, as the affair becomes
ritualistic, ceremonialized and then institutionalized, it gains 'official'
status when priests, prophets and princes participate, at which point the
gory business of Murder, Inc becomes as much a national pastime as feeding
people to lions was to ancient Rome.
Indeed, as dramatized in Apocalypto (below video), the ritual was not some
'private matter' simply between the victim, victimizer and the god who
demanded the blood sacrifice:
Rather, it was an open, public event, the
beating heart of the metropolis in fact, complete with gawkers, watchers,
onlookers and 'true believers' who cheered madly as hearts were cut out and
heads chopped off.
The only difference between then and now is that today's human sacrifice is
sexier and sanitized, helped along of course with technology making it all
seem more like an episode of Star Wars rather than a scene out of Apocalypto.
Instead of barely-clad, bone-in-nose, unwashed
warriors running barefoot through the jungle chasing some terrified 2-legged
creature scheduled to be the main course at a dinner honoring the Mayan god Kukulkan, we have technicians dressed in the respectable clothing of
military uniforms, sitting behind computer screens, lattes in one hand while
in the other is a joystick attached to a drone that is flown into 3rd-world
locales where women and children endure not just having their hearts cut
out, but their entire bodies ripped to shreds via high-yield explosive
warheads.
And while it is true that many of the 'enlightened' countries of the West
such as America, Great Britain and others who worship at the altar of money,
power and empire and who therefore engage in this modern-day form of human
sacrifice known as serial warfare in appeasing these dark gods, there is one
country in particular whose involvement in the grisly, gory business of
human sacrifice operates on a very different, personal, primal, and
primitive level, and that country of course is Israel.
Whereas the aforementioned countries deal in death not necessarily for
death's sake but rather as an unavoidable consequence of attaining the
blessings that the aforementioned gods of money and power bring, when it
comes to Israel however, the shedding of blood - innocent, defenseless blood
- holds particular 'sentimental' significance.
More personal than just business, when it comes
to the trappings, teachings and traditions of Judaism, blood is as intrinsic
to its identity as bread and wine are within some
Christian ceremonies.
It is, after all, that 'old time religion' that
functions as the beating heart of the Jewish state and which sustains and
maintains who it is, what it is, what it does, and how it lives.
The notion that Israel, again, THE JEWISH STATE, as her worshippers insist
upon her being characterized, would engage in the business of ritualistic
human sacrifice should come as no surprise to anyone who understands the
'beating heart' of what keeps her alive, meaning Judaism.
Human sacrifice, i.e. murdering innocent human
beings in order to appease the demands of some 'higher' power, is a theme
introduced within literally the first chapters of the very first book of the
Jewish Torah - the book of Genesis to be exact - where a penniless nomad
named Abraham - the 'Founding Father' of the Jewish state as the world has
been told time and again - has got it in his head to slit the throat of his
own son Isaac and burn his young son's body on a pile of stones in pleasing
and appeasing the
Jewish god Yahweh.
Luckily for Isaac, as the story goes, the voices in Abraham's head telling
him to engage in the very same kind of brutal black Mass depicted in
Apocalypto were drowned out by competing voices telling him not to murder
his son, but rather to sacrifice a nearby ram whose horns had been caught in
a briar and who could not escape to save its life.
The story - whether historically true or not, is immaterial to the fact that
in the minds of those whose identity is wrapped up in Israel, Judaism,
Zionism, etc, a pattern and a paradigm have been set through this legend -
that killing innocent, defenseless creatures that can neither escape nor
fight back is the manner by which the Jewish god is appeased and satiated
Using this - the slaughter and incineration of a ram - as the standard then,
from there the Judaic practice of killing docile, defenseless creatures for
the purpose of quelling and containing the anger of Yahweh, the Judaic god,
isn't just institutionalized, but becomes the institution itself.
Whether it is for atonement of sins, giving
thanks or whatever the mood of the occasion happens to be at that moment,
the slaughter of living creatures becomes THE method of connecting with and
'getting right' with 'the god of Israel' (a term publically used many times
by Jewish terrorists ranging from Menachem Begin to Netanyahu) as explained
numerous times in the books of Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers and others
found in the Torah.
Specifically, as the ritual dictates, by laying
hands on the head of the animal to be killed, the sins of the people of
Israel are transferred onto the animal, and upon its brutal slaughter, the
sins are wiped away and Yahweh is appeased, to wit:
'The priest is to place his hand on the head
of the sin offering and slaughter it
Then the priest is to take some of
the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar and pour
out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar
They shall remove all the fat and the priest
shall then burn the bull, ram, or goat on the altar as an aroma pleasing
to the Lord, and in this way the priest will make atonement for the
people of Israel, and their sins will be forgiven
'
Paired almost simultaneously with the
ritualistic practice of animal slaughter as the centerpiece of Judaic
worship come the various decrees from Yahweh's mouth to Israel's ear that he
- the angry, jealous, vengeful god who has chosen this small, seemingly
insignificant tribe of ne'er do wells to someday run the world - is no
longer satiated with only the slaughter of defenseless animals.
Now, having developed a more 'sophisticated'
sacrificial appetite, he demands that defenseless men, women and children
must suffer the same fate as well, specifically as laid out within several
passages of the Jewish Torah to wit:
'When the LORD your God brings you into the
land you are to possess and casts out the many peoples living there, you
shall then slaughter them all and utterly destroy them
You shall save
nothing alive that breathes
You shall make no agreements with them nor
show them any mercy
You shall destroy their altars, break down their
images, cut down their groves and burn their graven images with fire.
For you are a holy people unto the LORD thy
God and He has chosen you to be a special people above all others upon
the face of the earth
'
And there begins a wedding made in hell, where
ritualistic, religiously-driven animal slaughter is paired with war,
genocide, invasion and conquest.
Given the inherently supremacist foundation of Judaic thought ('God's chosen
people', 'light unto the world,' etc) paired with its inherently
anti-Gentile disposition, it was just a matter of time then before the two
ideas become merged into one - the equating of Gentiles as animals who were
fit for nothing but either enslavement or ritual slaughter, and the likely
catalyst for this merger was the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in
70 A.D. by the Romans, resulting in the cessation of the Judaic practice of
sacrificial slaughter of livestock for attaining atonement from the Judaic
god.
A substitution had to be found therefore if the Judaic community were to
maintain any sense of religious/social cohesiveness
The fact that Gentiles are referred to disparagingly amongst Jews as 'Goy'
or 'Goyim' - the Hebrew equivalent of the word 'livestock' or 'cattle' - is
one indication that this association between non-Jews and livestock (rams,
goats, sheep, etc) used for ritualistic sacrifice has been a fait accompli
now for some time.
As Israel sinks deeper and deeper into her
Judaism and her 'Jewishness', and the more powerful that the Jewish
community becomes, therefore the more 'comfortable' certain political and
religious leaders become in voicing ideas that before had to be kept hidden
from the Gentile world for the sake of 'operational security'.
Of the various statements made in recent
history, few compare in revealing this mindset than that made by Israel's
former Chief Sephardic Rabbi Ovadiah Yusef who stated to wit:
'Goyim were born only to serve us. Without
that, they have no place in the world, only to serve the People of
Israel
Why are gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they
will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat
With gentiles, it will be
like any person: They need to die, but God will give them longevity.
Why? Imagine that one's donkey would die, they'd lose their money. This
is his servant. That's why he gets a long life, to work well for this
Jew
'
The reaction on the part of the more 'cautious'
elements within organized Jewish circles, from
the ADL to
World Jewish
Congress et al was predictable in its utter duplicity, and unfortunately,
swallowed whole hog by the Gentile community.
One by one, powerful Jewish
groups and those who lead them lined up to denounce the Rabbi's statement
despite knowing full well that it reflected the essence of Judaism and that
it forms the foundation of Zionist thinking not only in Israel, but around
the world.
Sadly, the Gentiles, not yet comprehending the inherently
deceptive nature of Judaic linguistics and theatrics, believed it, much to
their own detriment.
But more effective in revealing the kinds of genocidal tendencies that have
come to plague the Judaic mind than the various statements from Jewish
leaders - religious and political - are the actions of Israel itself.
Whereas the various statements attributed to individuals such as Ovadia
Yusef and others can be compared to the distant howling of wolves announcing
their impending arrival, it is the ensuing slaughter and carnage that best
reveals the nature of the beast within.
That the present Holocaust in Gaza is in effect an exercise in ritualized
Jewish mass murder and human sacrifice cannot be disputed by any rational
human being. The deliberate targeting of civilians, the murder of women and
children as if the entire exercise were nothing more than shooting fish in a
barrel cannot be equated with any kind of protective or preventive military
operation on the part of a stable, sane nation state.
Operation 'Defensive
Edge' - like all its previous massacres - Jenin, Cast Lead, etc, etc, etc,
is the modern day equivalent of the very same ritual sacrifice
institutionalized within the pages of the Torah and the same human sacrifice
depicted within Apocalypto and for the same reasons - Israel, a nation whose
foundation is rooted in religious strains that demand the blood of innocent,
defenseless animals who cannot escape, the exact situation as pertains to
the people of Gaza today.
It is their blood, the Palestinians of Gaza and
elsewhere - warm, wet, sticky - that acts as the glue holding together the
nation of mentally ill, religious, racist nutcases known as Israel.
Indeed, as we read the words of the high priest in Apocalypto as he is about
to plunge the knife into the chest of his captive victim, they might as well
be the words of Benjamin Netanyahu or any of those within his
circles:
'We are a people of destiny
destined to be
the masters of all time, destined to be nearest to the gods
'
'Great Kulkulkan, whose fury could scourge the earth to oblivion, let us
appease you with this sacrifice
to exalt you in your glory and make our
people prosper
'
And, as in Apocalypto, when the citizens of the
Mayan superstate roared with approval as the beating heart of the victim was
cut out and the head chopped off, so too do we hear the roar of Jewry
worldwide as the innocent victims of Gaza are ceremonially murdered on the
high altar of Judaic human sacrifice-
Israeli citizens gather at the border
with food, drinks and other celebratory supplies, snapping pics of the
carnage in celebrating Gentile slaughter and in worshipping the Judaic
version of the
Mayan god Kukulkan.
Not that anyone should be particularly surprised or shocked at this, since
Jews worldwide have gathered together in much the same way to celebrate past
instances of Gentile mass murder in religious 'Holy Days' such as,
...and others.
Where the difference lies however between the Mayan superstate and today's
version of it - Israel - is that the Mayans did not have nuclear weapons
with which to burn down the entire world in one giant human sacrifice.
Let all hope and pray that the rest of the
Gentile world - and particularly those with the military resources to do it
- recognize that indeed this is what is in store for mankind if the beast
depicted within both the storyline of Apocalypto (below video) and within the pages of the
final book of the christian New Testament - The Apocalypse - is not
destroyed, for if not, as
Jesus
Christ himself predicted, 'no flesh would survive':
