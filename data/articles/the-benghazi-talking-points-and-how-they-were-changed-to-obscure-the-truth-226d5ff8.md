Even as the White House strove last week to move beyond questions about the
Benghazi attacks of Tuesday, September 11, 2012, fresh evidence emerged that
senior
Obama administration
officials knowingly misled the country about what had happened in the days
following the assaults.
The Weekly Standard has obtained a
timeline briefed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
detailing the heavy substantive revisions made to the CIAs talking points,
just six weeks before the 2012 presidential election, and additional
information about why the changes were made and by whom.

As intelligence officials pieced together the puzzle of events unfolding in
Libya, they concluded even before the assaults had ended that al
Qaeda-linked terrorists were involved.
Senior administration officials, however, sought
to obscure the emerging picture and downplay the significance of attacks
that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.
The frantic process that produced the changes to
the talking points took place over a 24-hour period just one day before
Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, made her now-famous
appearances on the Sunday television talk shows.
The discussions involved senior officials from,
The exchange of emails is laid out in a 43-page
report from the chairmen of five committees in the House of Representatives.
Although the investigation was conducted by
Republicans, leading some reporters and commentators to dismiss it, the
report quotes directly from emails between top administration and
intelligence officials, and it includes footnotes indicating the times the
messages were sent.
In some cases, the report did not provide the
names of the senders, but The Weekly Standard has confirmed the
identities of the authors of two critical emails - one indicating the main
reason for the changes and the other announcing that the talking points
would receive their final substantive rewrite at a meeting of top
administration officials on Saturday, September 15.
The White House provided the emails to members of the House and Senate
intelligence committees for a limited time and with the stipulation that the
documents were available for review only and would not be turned over to the
committees.
The White House and committee leadership agreed
to that arrangement as part of a deal that would keep Republican senators
from blocking the confirmation of John Brennan, the presidents
choice to run the CIA.
If the House report provides an accurate and
complete depiction of the emails, it is clear that senior administration
officials engaged in a wholesale rewriting of intelligence assessments about
Benghazi in order to mislead the public.
The Weekly Standard sought comment from
officials at the White House, the State Department, and the CIA, but
received none by press time.
Within hours of the initial attack on the U.S.
facility, the State Department Operations Center sent out two alerts:
-
the first, at 4:05 p.m. (all times are
Eastern Daylight Time), indicated that the compound was under attack
-
the second, at 6:08 p.m., indicated that
Ansar al Sharia, an al Qaeda-linked terrorist group operating in
Libya, had claimed credit for the attack.
According to the House report, these alerts were
circulated widely inside the government, including at the highest levels.
The fighting in Benghazi continued for another
several hours, so top Obama administration officials were told even as the
fighting was taking place that U.S. diplomats and intelligence operatives
were likely being attacked by al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists.
A cable sent the following day, September 12, by
the CIA station chief in Libya, reported that eyewitnesses confirmed the
participation of Islamic militants and made clear that U.S. facilities in
Benghazi had come under terrorist attack. It was this fact, along with
several others, that top Obama officials would work so hard to obscure.
After a briefing on Capitol Hill by CIA director David Petraeus,
Democrat Dutch Ruppersburger, the ranking member of the House
Intelligence Committee, asked the intelligence community for unclassified
guidance on what members of Congress could say in their public comments on
the attacks.
The CIAs Office of Terrorism Analysis prepared
the first draft of a response to the congressman, which was distributed
internally for comment at 11:15 a.m. on Friday, September 14 (see Version 1
far below).
This initial CIA draft included the assertion
that the U.S. government,
know[s] that Islamic extremists with ties
to al Qaeda participated in the attack.
That draft also noted that press reports,
linked the attack to Ansar al Sharia. The
group has since released a statement that its leadership did not order
the attacks, but did not deny that some of its members were involved.
Ansar al Sharia, the CIA draft continued,
aims to spread sharia law in Libya and emphasizes the need for jihad.
The agency draft also raised the prospect that
the facilities had been the subject of jihadist surveillance and offered a
reminder that in the previous six months there had been,
at least five other attacks against foreign
interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants, including the June
attack against the British Ambassadors convoy.
After the internal distribution, CIA officials
amended that draft to include more information about the jihadist threat in
both Egypt and Libya.
On 10 September we warned of social media
reports calling for a demonstration in front of the [Cairo] Embassy and
that jihadists were threatening to break into the Embassy, the agency
had added by late afternoon.
And:
The Agency has produced numerous pieces on
the threat of extremists linked to al Qaeda in Benghazi and Libya.
But elsewhere, CIA officials pulled back.
The reference to Islamic extremists no longer
specified Islamic extremists with ties to al Qaeda, and the initial
reference to attacks in Benghazi was changed to demonstrations.
The talking points were first distributed to officials in the interagency
vetting process at 6:52 p.m. on Friday. Less than an hour later, at 7:39
p.m., an individual identified in the House report only as a senior State
Department official responded to raise serious concerns about the draft.
That official, whom The Weekly Standard
has confirmed was State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland, worried
that members of Congress would use the talking points to criticize the State
Department for,
not paying attention to Agency warnings.
In an attempt to address those concerns, CIA
officials cut all references to Ansar al Sharia and made minor
tweaks.
But in a follow-up email at 9:24 p.m., Nuland
wrote that the problem remained and that her superiors - she did not say
which ones - were unhappy. The changes, she wrote, did not resolve all my
issues or those of my building leadership, and
State
Department leadership was contacting National Security Council
officials directly.
Moments later, according to the House report,
White House officials responded by stating
that the State Departments concerns would have to be taken into
account.
One official - Ben Rhodes, The Weekly
Standard is told, a top adviser to President Obama on national security
and foreign policy - further advised the group that the issues would be
resolved in a meeting of top administration officials the following morning
at the White House.
There is little information about what happened at that meeting of the
Deputies Committee.
But according to two officials with knowledge of
the process, Mike Morrell, deputy director of the CIA, made broad
changes to the draft afterwards. Morrell cut all or parts of four paragraphs
of the six-paragraph talking points - 148 of its 248 words (see Version 2
above).
Gone were the reference to Islamic extremists,
the reminders of agency warnings about al Qaeda in Libya, the reference to
jihadists in Cairo, the mention of possible surveillance of the facility
in Benghazi, and the report of five previous attacks on foreign interests.
What remained - and would be included in the final version of the talking
points - was mostly boilerplate about ongoing investigations and working
with the Libyan government, together with bland language suggesting that the
violent demonstrations - no longer attacks - were spontaneous responses
to protests in Egypt and may have included generic extremists (see Version
3 above).
If the story of what happened in Benghazi was dramatically stripped down
from the first draft of the CIAs talking points to the version that emerged
after the Deputies Committee meeting, the narrative would soon be built up
again.
In ensuing days, administration officials
emphasized a demonstration in front of the U.S. facility in Benghazi and
claimed that the demonstrators were provoked by a YouTube video.
The CIA had softened attack to
demonstration. But as soon became clear, there had been no
demonstration in Benghazi.
More troubling was the YouTube video.
(Susan)
Rice would spend much time on
the Sunday talk shows pointing to this video as the trigger of the chaos in
Benghazi.
What sparked the violence was a very
hateful video on the Internet. It was a reaction to a video that had
nothing to do with the United States.
There is no mention of any video in any of the
many drafts of the talking points.
Still, top Obama officials would point to the video to explain Benghazi.
President
Obama
and Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton even denounced the
video in a sort of diplomatic public service announcement in Pakistan. In a
speech at the United Nations on September 25, the president mentioned the
video several times in connection with Benghazi.
On September 17, the day after Rice appeared on the Sunday shows, Nuland
defended Rices performance during the daily briefing at the State
Department.
What I will say, though, is that Ambassador
Rice, in her comments on every network over the weekend, was very clear,
very precise, about what our initial assessment of what happened is.
And this was not just her assessment, it was
also an assessment youve heard in comments coming from the intelligence
community, in comments coming from the White House.
It was a preview of the administrations defense
of its claims on Benghazi.
After pushing the intelligence community to
revise its talking points to fit the administrations preferred narrative,
administration officials would point fingers at the intelligence community
when parts of that narrative were shown to be misleading or simply untrue.
And at times, members of the intelligence community appeared eager to help.
On September 28, a statement
from ODNI seemed designed to quiet the
growing furor over the administrations explanations of Benghazi.
In the immediate aftermath, there was
information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously
following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo.
We provided that initial assessment to
Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that
information to discuss the attack publicly and provide updates as they
became available.
The statement continued:
As we learned more about the attack, we
revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating
that it was a deliberate and organized attack carried out by extremists.
It remains unclear if any group or person
exercised overall command and control of the attack, and if extremist
group leaders directed their members to participate. However, we do
assess that some of those involved were linked to groups affiliated
with, or sympathetic to al Qaeda.
The statement strongly implies that the
information about al Qaeda-linked terrorists was new, a revision of the
initial assessment.
But it wasnt. Indeed, the original assessment
stated, without qualification,
we do know that Islamic extremists with
ties to al Qaeda participated in the attack.
The statement from the ODNI came not from
James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, but from his
spokesman, Shawn Turner.
When the statement was released, current and
former intelligence officials told The Weekly Standard that they found the
statement itself odd and the fact that it didnt come from Clapper stranger
still.
Clapper was traveling when he was first shown a
draft of the statement to go out under his name. It is not an accident that
it didnt.
The revelations about exactly how the talking points were written, revised,
and then embellished come amid renewed scrutiny of the administrations
handling of Benghazi.
Fox News spoke to a Special Ops soldier last
week who raised new questions about what happened during the attack, and the
State Departments inspector general acknowledged that the office would be
investigating the production of the Administrative Review Board
report on the attacks because of concerns that investigators did not speak
to a broad spectrum of individuals with knowledge of the attack and its
aftermath.
On May 8, the House Oversight and Government
Reform committee will hold another hearing on the matter.
And Republicans in Congress have asked the
administration to release all of the emails, something that would further
clarify how the changes came about.
