Techniques to Discredit
(Spanish
version)
Sutton and Wood warned,
"Anyone in the U.S. who promotes unwelcome
news for the elite receives some unwelcome attention in return."
This attention includes the use of experts,
mainstream media, and anti-hate organizations, for well-coordinated
character assassination.(*)
According to author Perloff, a document released
by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, on September 23, 1956
entitled, Propaganda and the Alert Citizen outlined the tactics reportedly
used by the Establishment to discredit opposition.
Quoting from this document, Perloff wrote,
"The tactic used had a prototype in a
directive issued by the Communist Party... It read: When certain
obstructionists become too irritating, label them, after suitable
build-ups, as Fascist or Nazi or anti-Semitic, and use the prestige of
anti-Fascist and tolerance organizations to discredit them... In the
public mind constantly associate those who oppose us with those names
which already have a bad smell."
"Because the Establishment controls the
media," wrote Allen, "anyone exposing the Insiders will be the recipient
of a continuous fusillade of [criticism]... from newspapers, magazines,
TV and radio. In this manner one is threatened with the loss of 'social
respectability' if he dares broach the idea that there is organization
behind any of the problems currently wrecking America."
"Smear tactics" from "left and right" are "standard operating
procedure," explained Sutton and Wood.
Even if you don't believe in the phony
left/right political spectrum and have no political affiliation, you may be
assigned one.
Then the financial elite can use the opposite
political party expressed in the mainstream news for character
assassination. These labels, describe Sutton and Wood,
"divert attention from responsible reasoned
criticism with no attachment to a synthetic political spectrum."
"If you assemble the evidence, carefully present your proofs, and try to
expose these power seekers, the Establishment's mass media will accuse
you of being a dangerous paranoid who is - dividing - our people," Allen
said.
In his book, With No Apologies, Senator
Goldwater describes being on the receiving end of the Establishment's
"professional scandalmongers."
Apparently, because he was not controlled by the
Establishment, the New York Times and New York Herald Tribune were used to
discredit him during his campaigns.
Perloff wrote,
"Barry Goldwater was the Republican nominee
and, as such, was the first GOP Presidential candidate in decades it
[the CFR] had not controlled. Indeed, Goldwater represented nearly
everything the Establishment was against. For that reason, the mass
media was arrayed against him, and he was falsely characterized as a
fanatic who would start a nuclear war and snatch social security checks
from the elderly."
Investigations into Crimes and Practices of the
Financial Elite are Thwarted - Witnesses Discredited
DeCamp explained that during his investigation of a child prostitution ring
involving Satanism which lead to Washington D.C., that,
"Articles began to appear in the Omaha
World-Herald, aimed to discredit the witnesses and intimidate any other
potential child victim-witnesses from testifying."
He cites some examples including the
World-Herald's charge that it was a "hoax based on rumor."
Editorial attacks ensued with titles such as,
Grand Jury Did Its Job; The Insults Are Intolerable, and Schmit Panel Can't
Duck its Responsibility in Hoax.
The front page of the Omaha World-Herald on July 25, 1990 ran the headline,
Grand Jury Says Abuse Stories Were a Carefully Crafted Hoax. And an article
entitled, Former Legislator's Angry Memo Turns Sober Nebraska on its Ear,
which appeared in the March 17, 1990 edition of the Kansas City Star, stated
that the memo was, spawning swirls of gossip.
The same article described that the accusations
against these prominent people was like "insulting God."
Compare these attacks to the criticism General
Butler received by the mainstream news after exposing the plot by Wall
Street to overthrow the U.S. Government, or the harassment
the Reece
Committee received when investigating the Tax-exempt Foundations.
One of the most damaging dirty tricks used against DeCamp was an anonymous
complaint from a concerned citizen, which was logged with the Department of
Social Services, stating that he and his wife were abusing their daughter.
This tactic was apparently used to stop his investigation and knock him out
of the senate race.
The cover-up of a similar event occurred in
Minnesota, where prosecutor Kathleen Morris came under savage attack from
the media when investigating a child sex ring that was apparently linked to
the financial elite.
After experiencing considerable pressure, Morris
relinquished the investigation to Attorney General Hubert Humphrey Jr.
Humphrey soon closed the case due to insufficient evidence.
When the elite are linked to these types of crimes, evidence become missing,
leads are not followed, people are discredited, jailed, disappear, or have
accidents. These occasional leaks are part of a steady stream of corruption
that only occasionally surfaces in the mainstream news. The discrediting and
harassment tactics used during these cover-ups can happen anywhere the elite
need to eliminate exposure to their activities.
DeCamp calls it an,
"international organized crime syndicate,
engaged in pedophilia, pornography, satanism, drugs, and
money-laundering," which is "protected... by federal authorities."
William H. Kennedy describes an organized
kidnapping ring in Belgium linked to the financial elite, in his book
Satanic Crime: A Threat in the New Millennium.
Using mainstream news, Kennedy explains that
during these investigations, the police were consistently incompetent, made
frequent mistakes, and failed to follow leads. These seemingly deliberate
acts resulted in further deaths and kidnappings.
The presiding judge, Jean-Marc Connerotte,
secured the arrest of suspect Marc Dutroux. Dutroux escaped from prison once
and was poised for a second escape before he was found with a handcuff key.
According to Kennedy, Dutroux provided kidnapped girls to a Satanic cult
which included members of the Bilderbergers. Judge Connerotte required a
bulletproof vehicle and armed guards after learning that a contract had been
taken out on his life. He was eventually dismissed from the bench.
The removal of Connerotte, and the cover-up,
triggered a peace march by 300,000 outraged Belgians who demanded reform of
the political and judicial system.
The Hidden Evil is Beyond a Congressional
Investigation
Similar tactics were used during the investigation of the Tax-exempt
Foundations and their Think Tank interlocks during the Reece Committee
hearings.
Wormser described the violence of the attacks
against the committee as "amazing."
The Reece Committee itself observed that because
the Tax-exempt Foundations and Think Tanks control the mainstream news and
the government, that they were unable to conduct their investigation.
The committee stated specifically,
"The far-reaching power of the large
foundations and of the interlock has so influenced the press, the radio,
and even the government that it has become extremely difficult for
objective criticism of foundation practices to get into news channels
without having first been distorted, slanted, discredited, and at times
ridiculed."
In his book, How the World Really Works, Alan B.
Jones considers the account of another Reece Committee insider, Norman Dodd,
the Research Director.
Dodd attests that death threats, harassment of
witnesses, stalking, surveillance, blackmail, and framings were the real
reasons the trials were discontinued.
The Reece Committee declared,
"The pressure against Congressional
investigation has been almost incredible. As indicated by their
arrogance in dealing with this Committee, the major foundations and
their associated intermediary organizations have intrenched (sic)
themselves behind a totality of power which presumes to place them
beyond serious criticism and attack."
Smoot commented,
"As we have seen, two different committees
of Congress - one Democrat-controlled and one Republican-controlled -
have tried to investigate the... tax-exempt foundations which are
interlocked with, and controlled by, and provide the primary source of
revenue for, the Council on Foreign Relations and its affiliates."
Smoot continues,
"Both committees were gutted with ridicule
and vicious denunciation... by internationalists in the Congress, by
spokesmen for the executive branch of government, and by big respected
publishing and broadcasting firms which are a part of the controlled
propaganda network of the Council on Foreign Relations."
So according to the results of a congressional
investigation, the Tax-exempt Foundations and Think Tanks are beyond
investigation.
There was another attempt to investigate the Think Tanks by Congressman
Larry McDonald.
"In 1980, the American Legion national
convention passed Resolution 773, which called for a congressional
investigation of the Trilateral Commission and its predecessor, the
Council on Foreign Relations," wrote author Marrs.
"The following year," proclaimed Marrs "a
similar resolution was approved by the veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW)."
"Congressman Larry McDonald," continued Marrs, "introduced these
resolutions in the House of Representatives but nothing came of it."
Unfortunately Congressman McDonald, who opposed
the Establishment, died in a curious incident involving a Russian missile
which blew up Korean Airlines 007 on September 1, 1983.
The bottom line is simply this: The
Establishment will not allow the various organizations which it controls to
stop the Hidden Evil.
According to these researchers, some with first-hand experience, anyone who
exposes the activities of the elite usually receives an assortment of
character assassination from the mainstream media, anti-hate organizations,
and official experts. Lawsuits may be filed. An IRS audit may occur. Other
tactics are used, such as being threatened, framed, blackmailed, and
murdered.
Accidents which result in death or injury may be
reverse engineered to appear as though they were not planned.(**)
Many of these attacks are tactics within the Hidden Evil. According to the
HUAC document, some people are allowed to gain enough momentum until they
are in pubic view so they may be smeared by the mainstream media or other
organizations under elite control. By this account, it is probably easier
for the elite to ruin famous people, because they require no "suitable
build-ups."
Anyone who falls into disfavor with the elite
can be ruined by these methods.
"The money powers prey upon the nation in
times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity. It is more
despotic than a monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, and more selfish
than bureaucracy. It denounces as public enemies, all who question its
methods or throw light upon its crimes."
-Abraham Lincoln
The Dangers of a Congressional Investigation
Congress, in general, is under the absolute control of this mafia.
As previously demonstrated, this has been
accomplished through years of infiltration, blackmail, intimidation and
bribery. The elite, who own the United States, literally, will never allow
an investigation into the Hidden Evil. They will never allow the system
which they control to stop this.
A congressional investigation may be done for the deliberate purpose of
convincing the general population that it does not exist, and to publicly
discredit those speaking about it by portraying them as a few paranoid
conspiracy theorists. Any investigation into the Hidden Evil by congress or
another organization under the control of the Establishment will result in a
whitewash.
These whitewashes by congress have unfolded repeatedly. Consider that in
addition to the outside attacks, the Reece Committee was also killed from
within.
This included receiving "palpably inadequate"
funding, a reduction in research staff, denial of evidence, and general
stonewalling.
"Mr. Reece understood, soon after our
investigation started, if not before, that we would be met with every
obstacle which could be put in our way," stated Wormser.
Other congressional whitewashes include the
Roberts Commission (Pearl Harbor cover-up), and the Kerry Subcommittee (Iran
Contra Scandal, Federal Drug Trafficking).
The Warren Commission (investigating the death
of JFK) is said to have been heavily whitewashed, the 9/11 Commission was a
whitewash, and the McCormack-Dickstein Commission was partly a
whitewash.(***)
Some of these commissions were led by members of
the CFR.
The United Nations
If the UN investigated the Hidden Evil it would be a maneuver to whitewash
and discredit targets.
According to some researchers, the United
Nations is a creation of the CFR. The UN would like us to believe that
they're an organization that acts as a non-partisan referee, which
reluctantly intervenes in world conflicts for the betterment of all parties
concerned.
Apparently, the idea is that if enough chaos is
caused and the UN is portrayed in a positive manner, then the masses will
believe that a world government under the control of the UN is the only hope
for world peace.
In a chapter entitled, United Nations and World Government Propaganda, Smoot
commented,
"All American advocates of supra-national
government, or world government, claim their principal motive is to
achieve world peace. Yet," he says, "these are generally the same
Americans whose eager interventionism helped push America into two world
wars."
United Nations
"By 1945, the Rockefellers were ready,"
wrote Allen.
"Grandson Nelson was one of the 74 CFR
members at the founding meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco."
Perloff added,
"Of the American delegates at the founding
UN conference in San Francisco, more than forty belonged to the CFR."
On the left is a March 1947 picture, which shows
John D. Rockefeller III presenting UN Secretary General Trygve Lie with an
$8.5 million dollar check to purchase land for the UN headquarters. Below it
is the founding UN conference on June 15, 1945 in San Francisco.(*1)
"Nelson and his brothers donated the land
for the United Nations complex along the East River in New York," wrote
Allen, and added, "possibly because they did not want the new
headquarters of their World Government to be more than a short taxi-ride
away from their penthouses."
Author Marrs portrays the UN as,
"an outgrowth of the old League of Nations,"
which he describes as a failed attempt at, "world government."
"A primary mover of this and subsequent
actions to establish a United Nations was John Foster Dulles, who had
helped found the Council on Foreign Relations," wrote Marrs.
Marrs continued,
"Considering Dulles and the other CFR
members [are] behind the creation of the UN, it is no surprise to find
that organization today supervising the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (commonly called the World Bank) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
Author Alan B. Jones sums up the UN as a front
for the banking elites to be used as the core of a political structure for a
world government, using the IMF as the world central bank.
"In 1948, the State Department created the
U.S. Committee for the UN... as a semi-official organization to
propagandize for the UN," conveyed Smoot.
The CFR dominates this committee, he says.
He also contends that the UN Charter, which the
CFR would like to have the US Constitution replaced with, is essentially a
charter for enslavement.
"The 'world peace' aspects of the United
Nations were emphasized to enlist support of the American public," wrote
Smoot.
However, he adds, "the UN Charter really
creates a worldwide social, cultural, economic, educational, and
political alliance - and commits each member nation to a program of
total socialism."
Project Megiddo
Project Megiddo is described by the
FBI as a,
"strategic assessment of the potential for
domestic terrorism in the United States..."
The document was apparently circulated to law
enforcement throughout the country in 1999 to help identify domestic
terrorist activities spawned by the year 2000 craze.
It basically says that anyone who holds,
"political beliefs relating to the New World
Order (NWO) conspiracy theory," is "paranoid." "The challenge to law
enforcement," it states, "is to understand these extremist theories."
And just what are these paranoid conspiracy
theories that the FBI is "educating" law enforcement on?
According to the FBI,
"The NWO conspiracy theory holds that the
United Nations (UN) will lead a military coup against the nations of the
world to form a socialist or One World Government."
The FBI lists other groups that a paranoid
conspiracy theorist might say are part of this socialist overthrow as:
They add,
"Law enforcement officials will probably
notice different versions of this theory, depending upon the source."
They continue,
"Law enforcement officers, as well as
military personnel, should be aware that the nation's armed forces have
been the subject of a great deal of rumor and paranoia circulating among
many militia groups."
They describe these militias as "Patriots," and
"right-wing" groups who,
"believe they are being persecuted by the
satanic government of the United States."
It looks like the CFR-controlled FBI laid the
groundwork to portray anyone telling the truth as a dangerous paranoid.
Megiddo is clearly CFR Damage Control. It seems
to be an employment of the tactics contained in the HUAC document that
Perloff warned about.
Remember?
"In the public mind constantly associate
those who oppose us with those names which already have a bad smell."
Continuing, they stated,
"Use of this term [New World Order] within
militia circles became more common after President Bush starting using
it to refer to... using international organizations to assist in
governing international relations," and added, "The term One World
Government is also used as a synonym for the New World Order."
According to a document written by Dennis L.
Cuddy, PhD, entitled, Chronological History of the New World Order, the term
has been used since the mid 30s by a variety of people including multiple
members of the CFR such as,
-
Nelson Rockefeller
-
Henry Kissinger
-
Richard Nixon
It has been mentioned in CFR's publication
Foreign Affairs. H. G. Wells spoke of it, as did Mikhail Gorbachev.
It has been used by George H. W. Bush on
multiple occasions.
"The term 'New World Order,'" says Cuddy,
"has been used thousands of times... by proponents in high places of
federalized world government."
In the last several years it has been used by
leaders of a variety of nations who are obviously under the control of the
financial elite.
So according to Project Megiddo, the New World Order does exist and is
beneficial. However, when we consider the publications of the "international
organizations" that are assisting with "governing international relations"
that Bush has been a member of, such as the CFR, the TC, and the
Bilderbergers, it becomes clear that their intentions are to reduce civil
liberties and merge America into a single world government controlled by
them.
It's obvious to me that Megiddo is
disinformation, used for the purpose of discrediting anyone who is
attempting to warn law enforcement about the fate of America.
Speaking of Project Megiddo's predecessor, Former FBI Senior Special Agent
Ted L. Gunderson wrote,
"In 1996 the FBI Phoenix Division issued a
pamphlet to local and state law enforcement agencies that set forth the
profile of various terrorists in the United States... This profile
includes: Defenders of the U.S. constitution against the federal
government and the UN (Super Patriots) [and]... anyone who makes
references to the United States Constitution..."
He warns,
"An active Federal Government Disinformation
Program... was instituted for the purpose of discrediting... [people]
who report the truth about the government."
Apparently, according to Gunderson, federal
agencies release these documents as disinformation for the sole purpose of
discrediting people who begin to wake up and tell the truth.
I wonder - if we know that these two documents
exist, then is it possible that more damaging information has been given to
law enforcement to discredit the truth movement?
"Distrust of the government by not thousands
but tens of millions of U.S. citizens is confirmed in public opinion
surveys," stated Dr. Alexander in his book, Future War.
"Many of these conspiracy theory adherents
believe that the government - or some other supranational organization -
is attempting to take freedom away from citizens."
As expected, he lists these supranational
organizations as, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers, and the
Council on Foreign Relations, and The Order of Free and Accepted Masons.
He continues,
"Some of them see non-lethal weapons as
tools to facilitate those objectives. They believe that these weapons
potentially could be used to enslave them..."
"Such systems," he says, "are usually
rumored to be designed and controlled by some unspecified 'They' who are
the ultimate powerbrokers."
Evidence has already been provided which
undeniably proves that the Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign
Relations have infiltrated the executive branch.
I wonder how many of those tens of millions of
conspiracy theorists are targeted but don't know it.
False Memory Syndrome Foundation
According to some researchers, one example of an organization that was
launched for the sole purpose of discrediting people is the False Memory
Syndrome Foundation (FMSF).
In his book, Mass Control: Engineering Human
Consciousness, author Jim Keith refers to the FMSF as a,
"pseudo-scholarly" front organization,
consisting of "a group of psychiatrists whose mission is to prove that
cult abuse and mind control are figments of the imagination."
According to Keith, many of the psychiatrists on
the FMSF board have been linked to mind-control experiments and the
military.
They are called in to court cases to discredit
ritual abuse survivors. Author Constantine's analysis is similar, he
proclaims that the FMSF consists of a panel of experts which are used to
discredit therapists and victims that come forward with cases of Satanic
Ritual Abuse (SRA) and experimentation.
Professor Jennifer J. Freyd explains in her book, Betrayal Trauma, how the
FMSF, her colleagues, and the mainstream media attempted to discredit her
research into repressed memories.
Her mother, Pamela Freyd, a founding member of
the FMSF, also participated in the attacks against her credibility.
In their book, Trance Formation of American, Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips
arrive at the same conclusion. These and other authors contend that the CIA
found it necessary to create this professional organization in order to
discredit abuse claims.
Mainstream News is Used to Discredit Targets
Anytime mainstream media addresses an issue like this there is a very real
danger of it being an attack.
This was clearly the case with The Washington
Post's January 14, 2007 article, entitled, Mind Games, or more
appropriately, it should have been called, Word Games.
Catherine Graham, the owner of The Washington Post, is a member of the
Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and the
Bilderbergers. The Post and most other mainstream news are controlled by the
very elite Think Tanks that I'm alleging are responsible for this covert war
against the civilian population.
While I can't say for sure how this story was arranged, my guess is that
representatives from the Post approached some TIs and portrayed themselves
to be genuinely interested in covering the issue. Naturally, TIs anxious to
get the word out, cooperated. But what resulted was a standard discrediting
article. Although it did explain that thousands of people in the NATO
countries claim to be targeted, it basically described them as delusional.
Some common tactics to discredit are to portray facts as beliefs, to ignore
evidence, and portray people as a haters or paranoids. This article has done
all three. They realize that most of their readers won't research this story
for themselves.
Also, no websites devoted to this phenomenon
were listed so their readers could follow-up.
"The idea of a group of people convinced
they are targeted by weapons that can invade their minds has become a
cultural joke," they wrote.
Referring to targeted people they stated,
"In their esoteric lexicon, 'gang stalking'
refers to the belief that they are being followed and harassed: by
neighbors, strangers or colleagues who are agents for the government."
Notice how they used the word, "belief."
The article continued,
"Gloria Naylor, a renowned African American
writer, seems to defy many of the stereotypes of someone who believes in
mind control."
Once again, playing games with words. In this
case implying that mind-control is just a belief and that projects such as
MKULTRA did not take place.
This is not a belief, it's a fact. Later in the
article they acknowledged MKULTRA but portrayed it as simply an,
"infamous CIA program that involved, in
part, slipping LSD to unsuspecting victims."
No mention was made of the other "parts," such
as the children who were sexually abused, or of the other people who were
brutally tortured and had their lives destroyed. This filtering out of
information is basically, lying.
They described one TI, probably an informant, who,
"criticizes what he calls the 'wacky claims'
of TIs who blame various government agencies or groups of people without
any proof."
Of course this torturous program has not been
proven in a court of law. And for reasons previously mentioned - it never
will be. But there is plenty of evidence that it exists.
The article went on to describe the TI mentioned above (a doctor), who was,
"hoping to prove that V2K, the technology to
send voices into people's heads, is real."
Once again, playing games with words.
As previously demonstrated, mainstream
publications announced that V2K was possible in the 70s. Once more, turning
a fact into an opinion or belief. They are fully aware that most people
either don't have the time or the inclination to do the research.
Of course no hit story would be complete without the Establishment's use of
official "experts" who assist them in damaging potential witnesses.
Regarding MKULTRA, the article quoted from their interview with Dr. John B.
Alexander, one of the alleged creators of this program.
They wrote, Alexander acknowledged that,
"there were some abuses that took place,"
but added that, on the whole, "I would argue we threw the baby out with
the bath water."
More games with words.
First, dismissing MKULTRA as just "some abuses,"
leads those who have not studied it (most of their readers) to conclude that
there were a few slip-ups in an otherwise beneficial program. Second,
implying that it stopped. Funny, Dr. Alexander must know that it continues
in its advance form.
As I've demonstrated, he and his colleagues
helped create these weapons on behalf of their CFR handlers, for the "New
World Order" which they've trumpeted in their articles.
The Post continues citing more "experts."
"Ralph Hoffman, a professor of psychiatry at
Yale who has studied auditory hallucinations, regularly sees people who
believe the voices are a part of government harassment," they said.
"Not all people who hear voices are
schizophrenic, he says, noting that people can hear voices episodically
in highly emotional states... People who think the voices are caused by
some external force are rarely dissuaded from their delusional belief,
he says."
Quoting Professor Hoffman, they wrote,
"These are highly emotional and gripping
experiences that are so compelling for them that ordinary reality seems
bland."
There are several assumptions that most readers
of this statement will come away with.
First, that V2K doesn't exist. Second, that all
people complaining that an available technology is being used to harass them
are definitely delusional. Third, that the government has not targeted the
civilian population with advanced technology in the past.
Continuing their assault, they stated,
"Scott Temple, a professor of psychiatry at
Penn State University who has been involved in two recent studies of
auditory hallucinations, notes that those who suffer such hallucinations
frequently lack insight into their illness. Even among those who do
understand they are sick, 'that awareness comes and goes... People feel
overwhelmed, and the delusional interpretations return.'"
So, Professor Temple studied auditory
hallucinations, but did he study a technology that can cause them?
The article doesn't say. Once more, the
implication is that it doesn't exist and that all of those complaining about
it are delusional.
Remember, doctors are highly complicit in the cover-up of this program. In
addition, as previously demonstrated, the elite-owned Tax-exempt Complex
provides the grants to these professors to do research projects with
pre-determined outcomes. In other words, when the Establishment wants an
official "expert" to prove a point, they'll provide them with grants to
carry out a project which they've created.
These college professors are often owned by the
Establishment.
"The very 'realness' of the voices is the
issue-how do you disbelieve something you perceive as real? That's
precisely what Hoffman, the Yale psychiatrist, points out: So lucid are
the voices that the sufferers - regardless of their educational level or
self-awareness - are unable to see them as anything but real. 'One thing
I can assure you' Hoffman says, 'is that for them, it feels real.'"
The people at the Post accomplished their
obvious goal.
My guess is that this story ran because
information was beginning to leak out to the public.
Summary
Those who expose the financial elite typically receive character
assassination from radio, TV, print media, official "experts," and
"anti-hate" organizations. A combination of framings, murders, "accidents,"
and lawsuits may occur.
"Educational" material is distributed to law
enforcement to help them understand the "paranoid extremists" who believe
that multinational corporations are installing a global dictatorship.
Footnotes
* DeCamp stated that the elite used the
mainstream news, the Anti Defamation League (ADL), and the Cult
Awareness Network (CAN) to discredit him and other witnesses. The
Establishment also used the mainstream news and the ADL to discredit the
Reece Committee. For examples of this see Foundations: Their Power and
Influence, by Rene Wormser. Also see The Invisible Government by Dan
Smoot who describes how the Establishment labeled people anti-semitic
and racists who investigated the Tax-exempt Foundations under the Cox
Committee.
** DeCamp spoke of learning about an impending lawsuit against him which
was to be used to destroy him in public view. There were 15 suspicious
deaths of potential witnesses surrounding the Franklin case. One
included chief investigator Gary Cordori who conveyed to DeCamp that he
had evidence that would "blow the story wide open." Senator Loran Schmit
who participated in the investigation received death threats and
attempts to ruin him financially. DeCamp also stated that during the
investigation multiple witnesses received IRS audits. Sutton and Wood
contend that IRS audits are often used to intimidate critics of the
Establishment. During Cointelpro the IRS was used for harassment, as
described in the book, War At Home, by attorney Brian Glick. See also
The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr. for how he was arrested for
falsifying his tax returns in retaliation for his nonviolent direct
action to affect social change.
