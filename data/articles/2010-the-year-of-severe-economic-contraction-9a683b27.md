Upbeat reports in the financial media, belie the
effects of the ongoing credit contraction.
Massive injections of central bank liquidity
have prevented the collapse of financial markets, but have done little to
ease the deleveraging of households or stimulate activity the broader
economy. The crisis has stripped $13 trillion in equity from working
families who now find their access to credit either cut off or severely
curtailed by the same banks that received hefty taxpayer-funded bailouts.
The fiscal strangulation of the millions of
people who are no longer considered "creditworthy" is progressively
weakening demand and spreading pessimism across all income levels.
Growing public desperation was the focus of a
special weekend report by Bloomberg News:
"Americans have grown gloomier about both
the economy and the nations direction over the past three months even
as the U.S. shows signs of moving from recession to recovery. Almost
half the people now feel less financially secure than when President
Barack Obama took office in January, a Bloomberg National Poll shows.
The economy is the countrys top concern, with persistently high
unemployment the greatest threat the public sees. Eight of 10 Americans
rate joblessness a high risk to the economy in the next two years,
outranking the federal budget deficit, which is cited by 7 of 10. An
increase in taxes is named as a high risk by almost 6 of 10.
Fewer than 1 in 3 Americans think the economy will improve in the next
six months... Only 32 percent of poll respondents believe the country is
headed in the right direction, down from 40 percent who said so in
September."

The near-delirious optimism that followed the
2008 presidential election has fizzled in less than 12 months.
While the policies of the
Obama
administration have improved Wall Street's prospects for record
profits and lavish bonuses, ordinary working people continue to fight to
keep their jobs and maintain their standard of living.
Recent data show that household debt which
surged during the boom years is being pared back at a historic pace.
Household debt to disposable income has plummeted from 136 percent to 122
percent in a little more than a year, leaving many families with little to
spend at the malls or shopping centers.
Severe retrenchment has triggered a shift towards personal thriftiness which
is reducing economic activity and strengthening deflationary pressures. 2010
is likely to be even worse, as mushrooming foreclosures and commercial real
estate defaults force banks to slash lending accelerating the rate of
decline.
This is from Bloomberg:
"Foreclosure filings in the U.S. will reach
a record for the second consecutive year with 3.9 million notices sent
to homeowners in default, RealtyTrac Inc. said. This years filings will
surpass 2008s total of 3.2 million as record unemployment and price
erosion batter the housing market...
Foreclosure filings exceeded 300,000 for the ninth straight month in
November, RealtyTrac said today. A weak labor market and tight credit
are "formidable headwinds" for the economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke said in a Dec. 7 speech in Washington.
The 7.2 million jobs lost since the
recession began in December 2007 are the most of any postwar economic
slump, Labor Department data show. Unemployment, at 10 percent last
month, wont peak until the first quarter, Quigley said."

The Obama administration's $787 billion stimulus
pushed GDP into positive territory for the first time in more than a year,
but the maximum impact has already been felt.
President Obama - under advice from his chief
advisors - has shifted his focus from soaring unemployment to long-term
deficits. Additional stimulus will be no more than $200 billion, of which, a
mere $50 billion will go towards jobs initiatives.
At the same time,
Fed
chair Ben Bernanke will terminate the quantitative easing (QE)
program which kept long-term interest rates low while providing financing
for the housing market.
When the program ends, rates will rise, housing
prices will tumble, and liquidity will drain from the system. The end of QE
coupled with dwindling stimulus ensures that economy will slide back into
recession in the 2nd or 3rd Quarter of 2010.
Policymakers have decided to create conditions that are favorable to
financial sector consolidation and the further privatization of public
assets. The economy is being strangled by design.
Here's economist Mark Thoma explaining why consumption will not
return to pre-crisis levels:
"For the immediate future and likely for
much longer than that, slow consumption growth is expected. One way that
could change is if the government implements a successful jobs program
or uses some other means to increase household income (e.g. a payroll
tax cut), and households spend rather than save the extra income..., but
the political environment makes a jobs program or further fiscal policy
action highly unlikely.
Similarly...the Fed is anxious to unwind its massive policy
intervention, not extend it, so monetary policy is unlikely to help much
either. Since monetary and fiscal policy authorities are unwilling to
provide further help, slow growth is the best outcome were likely to
get."

Consumption Growth Return to Its Pre-Recession Level?"

Along with flagging consumption, economists
Antonio Fatas and Ilian Mihov show why both investment and
employment will not rebound in the way that many bullish analysts expect.
By tracking the rate of recovery in the last 5
recessions, the two economists show that demand will remain flat for a
prolonged period of time, precipitating a "jobless" and "investmentless"
recovery. Their research supports additional stimulus to reduce the output
gap and engage the labor force in productive activity. The administration's
policies are the exact opposite of the majority of professional economists
who believe that deficits need to increase to effect overcapacity and
underutilization.
Obama is deliberately steering the economy
into a double-dip recession.
While financial institutions have been propped up with zero-rates, myriad
lending facilities and boatloads of Fed liquidity, the real economy
continues to on a downward path. As households rebalance accounts and
increase savings, the signs of distress are becoming more apparent.
In Europe, the ECB and IMF have begun to use the
financial crisis to wrest control of the budgets of deficits-plagued nations
to apply business-friendly austerity measures. The economic meltdown - that
was generated by overleveraged banks trading dodgy investment paper - is
now being used to assert corporate/bank control over sovereign nations.

...are all presently in the crosshairs of
neoliberal restructuring.
Surely, the same policies will be applied within
the United States under the guidance of supply-side economist and chief
advisor to the president, Lawrence Summers.
Thus, in 2010, economic contraction will
continue to force state and local governments to lay off millions of more
workers while public assets and services are made available at fire-sale
prices to private industry.
Debt deflation and deleveraging will continue into 2011, while
foreclosures, personal bankruptcies and defaults continue to mount. The
public's frustration with ineffective government policies, is likely to
change from pessimism to rage on short notice.
The
prospect of social unrest or sporadic incidents of violence can
no longer be excluded.
