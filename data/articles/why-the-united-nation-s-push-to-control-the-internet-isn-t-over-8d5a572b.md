An FCC Commissioner says
recent ITU meeting "like the Star Wars
bar scene."
Last month, a majority of the members of the
International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
voted for a murky proposal, suggesting that
the ITU has the power to regulate the Internet.
The proposal was passed despite vociferous
objections by the US and other developed countries. In the end, 55 countries
refused to sign on, while 89 did sign the resolution.
That was seen as a success for the US and its
allies, but anyone celebrating the outcome might be doing so too soon.
In fact, several of the companies that sided
with the US only ended up in that position because of an overreach on the
part of Iran, according to one speaker at a Thursday CES panel.
Ambassador
David Gross, who was the US representative to the ITU for several years,
said that Iran decided to,
"meddle in a well-cooked document," adding an
unusual "human rights" proposal that suggested a human right to access
telecommunications networks.
The twist is that this was a situation in which
the "human rights" were granted to a government, not to actual humans.
The
real goal was to strike a blow against sanctions. (Other behind-the-scenes
accounts, including one
published on Ars, suggest this proposal originated with Cuba. In any
case, both countries supported it.)
"Europe voted for the bulk of the ITRs
(International Telecommunications Regulations) in this space," noted
Robert McDowell, an FCC Commissioner who was in attendance.
Most
European countries didn't support the final proposal because of the more
controversial language inserted by Iran and Cuba.
"It could have been worse, in a way, but it
also could have been better."
The whole scenario was chaotic, with a
lack of clarity over what would or wouldn't be voted on.
"It was a like
the bar scene in Star Wars," he said.
And the ITU is not likely to stop its attempts
to increase its power, cautioned McDowell.
"This is an organization that has greatly
expanded its jurisdiction and will continue to do so," he said. "The
countries that accomplished what they did last month are patient, and
they are incrementalists."
"You could hear they [nations that voted
yes] have very real concerns about Internet governance," agreed David
Redl, a lawyer for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
"They are
not likely to stop talking about it just because the US doesn't want to.
We need to look at this going forward and do a lot of groundwork with
nations around the world."
The Congressman who introduced the panel, Rep.
Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), said that as chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, he was determined to stop the UN from messing with the current
structure of Internet governance.
"I predict dire consequences if the Internet
is regulated by the UN or other inter-governmental entities," said
Goodlatte. "Censorship could become the new norm," and free-market
principles could be threatened, he added.
The debate had many different forces in the US
working in the same direction.
Congress, after all, had passed a
resolution sending a "hands off" message to the ITU which was
overwhelmingly supported by both parties. Today, jokes abounded about the
rarity of seeing both AT&T and Google with representatives on the same
panel, actually agreeing with each other on policy.
Even though the leadership in developing
countries are the ones pushing for the ITU to have more power, the idea that
it will help their citizens was dismissed during today's talk.
"The direction the ITU is headed in will
hurt the developing world the most," said McDowell. "They fear a free...
Internet. They fear it politically, and they don't care about the
economics."
