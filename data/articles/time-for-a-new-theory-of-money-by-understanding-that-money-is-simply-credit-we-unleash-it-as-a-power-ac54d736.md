The reason our financial system has routinely
gotten into trouble, with periodic waves of depression like the one were
battling now, may be due to a flawed perception not just of the roles of
banking and credit but of the nature of money itself.
In our economic
adolescence, we have regarded money as a thing - something independent of
the relationship it facilitates.
But today there is no gold or silver
backing our money.
Instead,
its created by banks when they make loans (that
includes
Federal Reserve Notes or dollar bills, which are created by the
Federal Reserve, a privately-owned banking corporation, and lent into the
economy).
Virtually all money today originates as credit, or debt, which is
simply a legal agreement to pay in the future.
Money as Relationship
In an illuminating dissertation called Toward a General Theory of Credit
and Money in The Review of Austrian Economics (vol. 14:4, pages 267-317,
2001), Mostafa Moini, Professor of Economics at Oklahoma City University,
argues that money has never actually been a commodity or thing.
It has
always been merely a relation, a legal agreement, a credit/debit
arrangement, an acknowledgment of a debt owed and a promise to repay.
The concept of money-as-a-commodity can be traced back to the use of
precious metal coins. Gold is widely claimed to be the oldest and most
stable currency known, but this is not actually true. Money did not begin
with gold coins and evolve into a sophisticated accounting system. It began
as an accounting system and evolved into the use of precious metal coins.
Money as a unit of account (a tally of sums paid and owed) predated money
as a store of value (a commodity or thing) by two millennia; the
Sumerian and Egyptian civilizations using these accounting-entry payment
systems lasted not just hundreds of years (as with some civilizations using
gold) but thousands of years.
Their bank-like ancient payment systems were
public systems - operated by the government the way that courts, libraries and
post offices are operated as public services today.
In the
payment system of ancient Sumeria, goods were given a value in terms
of weight and were measured in these units against each other. The unit of
weight was the shekel, something that was not originally a coin but a
standardized measure. She was the word for barley, suggesting the original
unit of measure was a weight of grain.
This was valued against other
commodities by weight:
So many shekels of wheat equaled so many cows equaled
so many shekels of silver, etc.
Prices of major commodities were fixed by
the government;
Hammurabi, Babylonian king and lawmaker, has detailed tables
of these. Interest was also fixed and invariable, making economic life very
predictable.
Grain was stored in granaries, which served as a form of bank.
But grain
was perishable, so silver eventually became the standard tally representing
sums owed. A farmer could go to market and exchange his perishable goods for
a weight of silver, and come back at his leisure to redeem this market
credit in other goods as needed. But it was still simply a tally of a debt
owed and a right to make good on it later.
Eventually, silver tallies became
wooden tallies became paper tallies became electronic tallies.
The Credit Revolution
The problem with gold coins was that they could not expand to meet the needs
of trade.
The revolutionary advance of medieval bankers was that they
succeeded in creating a flexible money supply, one that could keep pace with
a vigorously expanding mercantile trade. They did this through the use of
credit, something they created by allowing overdrafts in the accounts of
their depositors.
Under what came to be called fractional reserve banking,
the bankers would issue paper receipts called banknotes for more gold than
they actually had.
Their shipping clients would sail away with their wares
and return with silver or gold, settling accounts and allowing the bankers
books to balance. The credit thus created was in high demand in the rapidly
expanding economy; but because it was based on the presumption that money
was a thing (gold), the bankers had to engage in a shell game that
periodically got them into trouble.
They were gambling that their customers
would not all come for their gold at the same time; but when they
miscalculated, or when people got suspicious for some reason, there would be
a run on the banks, the financial system would collapse, and the economy
would sink into depression.
Today, paper money is no longer redeemable in gold, but money is still
perceived as a thing that has to be there before credit can be advanced.
Banks still engage in money creation by advancing
bank credit, which becomes
a deposit in the borrowers account, which becomes checkbook money. In order
for their outgoing checks to clear, however, the banks have to borrow from a
pool of money deposited by their customers. If they dont have enough
deposits, they have to borrow from the money market or other banks.
As British author Ann Pettifor
observes:
[T]he banking system... has failed in its primary purpose: to act as a
machine for lending into the real economy. Instead the banking system has
been turned on its head, and become a borrowing machine.
The banks suck up cheap money and return it as more expensive money, if they
return it at all.
The banks control the money spigots and can deny credit to
small players, who wind up defaulting on their loans, allowing the big
players with access to cheap credit to buy up the underlying assets very
cheaply.
Thats one systemic flaw in the current scheme. Another is that the borrowed
money backing the banks loans usually comes from shorter-term loans. Like
Jimmy Stewarts beleaguered savings and loan in Its a Wonderful Life, the
banks are borrowing short to lend long, and if the money market suddenly
dries up, the banks will be in trouble.
That is what happened in
September
2008:
According to Rep. Paul Kanjorski, speaking on C-Span in February 2009,
there was a $550 billion run on the money markets.
Securitization -
Monetizing Loans Not with Gold But with Homes
The money markets are part of the shadow banking system where large
institutional investors park their funds.
The shadow banking system allows
banks to get around the capital and reserve requirements now imposed on
depository institutions by moving loans off their books. Large institutional
investors use the shadow banking system because the conventional banking
system guarantees deposits only up to $250,000, and large institutional
investors have much more than that to move around on a daily basis.
The
money market is very liquid, and what protects it in place of FDIC insurance
is that it is securitized, or backed by securities of some sort.
Often,
the collateral consists of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the securitized
units into which American real estate has been sliced and packaged,
sausage-fashion.
Like with the gold that was lent many times over in the 17th century, the
same home may be pledged as security for
several different investor groups
at the same time. This is all done behind an electronic curtain called
MERS
(an acronym for Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.), which has
allowed houses to be shuffled around among multiple, rapidly changing owners
while circumventing local recording laws.
As in the 17th century, however, the scheme has run into trouble when more
than one investor group has tried to foreclose at the same time. And the
securitization model has now crashed against the hard rock of hundreds of
years of state real estate law, which has certain requirements that the
banks have not met - and cannot meet, if they are to comply with the tax laws
for mortgage-backed securities. (For more on this,
see here.)
The bankers have engaged in what amounts to a massive fraud, not necessarily
because they started out with criminal intent (although that cannot be ruled
out), but because they have been required to in order to come up with the
commodities (in this case real estate) to back their loans.
It is the way
our system is set up:
The banks are not really creating credit and advancing
it to us, counting on our future productivity to pay it off, the way they
once did under the deceptive but functional fa√ßade of fractional reserve
lending.
Instead, they are vacuuming up our money and lending it back to us
at higher rates. In the shadow banking system, they are sucking up our real
estate and lending it back to our pension funds and mutual funds at compound
interest.
The result is a mathematically impossible pyramid scheme, which is
inherently prone to systemic failure.
The Public Credit
Solution
The flaws in the current scheme are now being exposed in the major media,
and it may well be coming down. The question then is what to replace it
with.
What is the next logical phase in our economic evolution?
Credit needs to come first. We as a community can create our own credit,
without having to engage in the sort of impossible pyramid scheme in which
were always borrowing from Peter to pay Paul at compound interest. We can
avoid the pitfalls of privately-issued credit with a public credit system, a
system banking on the future productivity of its members, guaranteed not by
things shuffled around furtively in a shell game vulnerable to exposure,
but by the community itself.
The simplest public credit model is the electronic community currency
system.
Consider, for example, one called Friendly Favors. The
participating Internet community does not have to begin with a fund of
capital or reserves, as is now required of private banking institutions. Nor
do members borrow from a pool of pre-existing money on which they pay
interest to the pools owners.
They create their own credit, simply by
debiting their own accounts and crediting someone elses. If Jane bakes
cookies for Sue, Sue credits Janes account with 5 Favors and debits her
own with 5. They have created money in the same way that banks do, but the
result is not inflationary. Janes plus-5 is balanced against Sues minus-5,
and when Sue pays her debt by doing something for someone else, it all nets
out. It is a zero-sum game.
Community currency systems can be very functional on a small scale, but
because they do not trade in the national currency, they tend to be too
limited for large-scale businesses and projects. If they were to grow
substantially larger, they could run up against the sort of exchange rate
problems afflicting small countries.
They are basically barter systems, not
really designed for advancing credit on a major scale.
The functional equivalent of a community currency system can be achieved
using the national currency, by forming a publicly owned bank. By turning
banking into a public utility operated for the benefit of the community, the
virtues of the expandable credit system of the medieval bankers can be
retained, while avoiding the parasitic exploitation to which private banking
schemes are prone.
Profits generated by the community can be returned to the
community.
A public bank that generates credit in the national currency could be
established by a community or group of any size, but as long as we have
capital and reserve requirements and other stringent banking laws, a state
is the most feasible option. It can easily meet those requirements without
jeopardizing the solvency of its collective owners.
For capital, a state bank could use some of the money stashed in a variety
of public funds.
This money need not be spent. It can just be shifted from
the Wall Street investments where it is parked now into the states own
bank. There is precedent establishing that a state-owned bank can be both a
very sound and a very lucrative investment.
The
Bank of North Dakota,
currently the nations only state-owned bank, is rated AA and recently
returned a 26 percent profit to the state. A decentralized movement has been
growing in the United States to explore and implement this option. [For more

We have emerged from the financial crisis with new clarity:
Money today is
simply credit.
When the credit is advanced by a bank, when the
bank is owned by the community, and when the profits return to the
community, the result can be a functional, efficient, and sustainable system
of finance.
