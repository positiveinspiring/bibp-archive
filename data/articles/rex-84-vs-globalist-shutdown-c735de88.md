REX 84 and Other
Martial Law Legislation/Orders
Readiness Exercise 1984 (REX-84) is an emergency response program involving
the implementation of martial law, the relocation of civilian populations,
and the arrest and detainment of segments of the population.
A rehearsal of the program was carried out April
5-13, 1984. It was led by
FEMA and the Department of Defense and
involved the coordination of 34 other Federal departments and agencies.
Rex 84 was allegedly written by,
-
Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, who was
both National Security Council White House Aide, and NSC liaison to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
-
John Brinkerhoff, the deputy director of
"national preparedness" programs for FEMA
Operation Garden Plot is a United States Army
and National Guard program under control of the US Northern Command (NORTHCOM)
to provide Federal military support during domestic civil disturbances.
One example of the programs implementation was
during the 1992 Los Angeles riots when US Army and Marine forces were used
in conjunction with the California National Guard.
The "John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007" (H.R.5122) amended
Posse Comitatus (which prevented the military from policing civilians) to allow
the Federal government to unilaterally take control of state National Guards
and position Federal troops anywhere in the country during a "public
emergency."
Clergy Response Teams are being trained by the federal government to "quell
dissent" and pacify citizens to obey the government in the event of a
declaration of martial law. Pastors are told to preach Romans 13 so the
flock learns to "obey the government,
during martial law.
Numerous presidential executive orders also indicate martial law
preparation.
For example,
Obamas
executive order that
creates a
council of state governors who will work with the feds to expand
military involvement in domestic security. This has fueled fears that the
administration is stepping up preparations for martial law.
There is congressional legislation that authorizes the Department of
Homeland Security to set up a network of
FEMA camp facilities to be used to
house U.S. citizens in the event of a national emergency.
Ominously, the bill also states that the camps
can be used to meet other appropriate needs, as determined by the Secretary
of Homeland Security, an open-ended mandate which many fear could mean the
forced detention of American citizens in the event of widespread rioting
after a national emergency or total economic collapse.
Similar camps were
used to
round-up 110,000 Japanese Americans during World War II without due
process.
As reported by the San Francisco Chronicle:
Beginning in 1999, the government has
entered into a series of single-bid contracts with Halliburton [the
former CEO was Dick Cheney] subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) to
build detention camps at undisclosed locations within the United States.
The government has also contracted with
several companies to build thousands of railcars, some reportedly
equipped with shackles, ostensibly to transport detainees.
According to diplomat and author Peter Dale Scott, the KBR contract is
part of a Homeland Security plan titled ENDGAME, which sets as its goal
the removal of 'all removable aliens' and 'potential terrorists.'
During January of 2010, Obama issued an
executive order establishing a so-called Council of Governors.
The order, further diminishes the sovereignty of the states and builds on a
framework for possible martial law. The executive order was completely
ignored by the corporate media.
One of the governors, Bev Perdue of North
Carolina, recently discussed the current orchestrated economic crisis and
stated:
"I think we ought to suspend, perhaps,
elections for Congress for two years and just tell them we won't hold it
against them, whatever decisions they make, to just let them help this
country recover. You want people who don't worry about the next
election."
Current Martial Law
Preparations
In 1999, Alex Jones recorded unbelievable footage of
Operation Urban Warrior
in Oakland, California (featured in Police State 2000 - below video).
In the drill, Marines go house-to-house kicking
in doors and taking residents (hired role players) to barbed wire
concentration camps.
A Marine says over a loudspeaker,
we will not tolerate civil disobedience.
The actors being rounded-up say things like,
Im an American. I have rights. Please
dont take our guns. Let us out of here, we need food.
The Marine on the loudspeaker says,
remain calm and cooperative so we can
process you into the camp faster.
It is clear that the
current orchestrated
economic crisis will likely be used as the justification for martial law.
During October of 2010, Alaska Army National
Guard Soldiers assisted Anchorage Police to calm or detain actors playing
protestors as part of the training scenario of exercise Vigilant Guard. One
of the actors playing a protestor held a food now sign, indicating a
scenario where law enforcement will have to detain and contain the hungry
masses.
During 2008, Congressman Brad Sherman and Michael Burgess
stated that
Congress was told that martial law would be declared if the $700 billion
banker bailout was not passed quickly.
Likewise, Congressman Ron Paul
recently stated that theyre [the globalists] setting the stage for
violence in this country to justify martial law.
Thousands of protestors are marching on Wall Street, and more importantly at
the private Federal Reserve banks, angry that the largest banks were
bailed
with $16.1 trillion of nearly interest-free loans. Meanwhile, millions of
Americans are losing their jobs and having their negative equity homes
foreclosed on.
Maybe anticipated widespread economic collapse
is why over 100 government agencies recently participated in the
Operation
Mountain Guardian drill, made possible due to a grant from the Department of
Homeland Security through FEMA Region VIII and the State of Colorado
Governors Office of Homeland Security.
It appears that the government is also preparing a contrived pandemic if
needed to justify martial law.
Other Rex-84 Type
Drills and Policies
There is no question that the United States is incrementally being
transformed into Nazi-like police state under
the
'War on Terror' ruse.
The federal government is training local law
enforcement that the real terrorists are not CIA funded Muslims in caves,
but Ron Paul supporters, people who oppose the private Federal Reserve,
libertarians, people who display bumper stickers, people who own gold, or
even people who fly a U.S. flag -- equating them with radical race hate
groups and terrorists.
Since 2003, U.S. Troops have engaged in house-to-house combat in Iraq,
kicking in doors while searching for insurgents (those that oppose U.S.
military invasion of their homeland). Such tactics
may soon be used in the
United States.
In 2008 The Pentagon announced plans to deploy a 20,000 strong internal
troop force inside the Continental United States (CONUS) that was set to be
trained by 2011, thus dovetailing into the current troop and equipment
movements around the country reported by truckers, as well as many more
troop sightings by everyday citizens. Interestingly enough, this plan
directly correlates with a 2009, Army funded, Rand Corporation study that
called for an internal United States police force to combat civil unrest.
In 2010, Operation Vigilant Guard occurred in Chicago, where a militarized
response during disasters and terrorist events in the United States was
practiced, with foreign troops participating.
"Today Americans would be outraged if U.N.
troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow they will be
grateful," globalist minion Henry Kissinger purportedly said in an
address to the Bilderbergers Group at Evian, France in 1991.
Last month in Denver, Colorado, more than 100
federal and state agencies were involved in Operation Mountain Guardian,
billed as a drill to simulate a terrorist attack based on events in Mumbai
that killed 164 people in 2008.
The media was not supposed to know that the
ultimate goal was to relocate children and at-risk populations to a sport
stadium FEMA camp relocation center.
During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the New Orleans police and National Guard
unleashed a wave of gun confiscations with these chilling words:
"No one
will be able to be armed. We will take all weapons. Only law enforcement
will be allowed to have guns."
Thousands of firearms were then confiscated
from law-abiding gun owners, who may have needed them to defend themselves.
The police gave no paperwork or receipts for those guns. They just stormed
in and seized them. During 2010, the National Guard practiced confiscating
guns using the War on Drugs as a justification.
Apparently nobody told them that the
government runs the drug trade.
Aside from martial law drills, the public is being conditioned that the 4th
Amendment no longer applies and that we are all guilty of something until
proven innocent. Naked Airport Body scanners bathe the public in
cancer-causing radiation and gangs of TSA agents strip-search children. Now
those who attend sporting events must also spread them and SUBMIT.
Notice that
whenever you transact online you must click SUBMIT rather than proceed or
continue.
More than 500 backscatter x-ray scanners mounted
in vans that can be driven past neighboring vehicles to see their contents
have been sold to government agencies and are hitting the streets. Homeland
Security also launched the See Something, Say Something, where citizens
are encouraged to report one another to the government.
Homeland Security is also recruiting jittery
coffee drinkers to spot terrorists. Even that adult lady still pretending to
be a queen endorses 1984.
The government is also conditioning Americans to accept totalitarian
government. Michael Allison, the 41-year old Illinois mechanic who faced
life in jail for recording police officers, has had all charges against him
dropped after a state judge ruled that his First Amendment rights had been
violated, following a trend of similar rulings across the country that
underscore the fact that it is not illegal to film cops.
However, the military and police are frequently
working together at DUI checkpoints and other venues to violate what remains
of Posse Comitatus.
Likewise, we are incrementally being conditioned to relinquish free speech
and accept censorship.
Google, a CIA front company, frequently censors the
alternative media by deleting or freezing alternative news websites and
YouTube channels.
Recently BART admitted to halting cell phone
service to stop protests, which are protected under the First Amendment. Not
to be left out, Yahoo has also been accused of censoring emails pertaining
to the Occupy Wall Street protests.
YouTube and the Federal Reserve are currently
trying to censor the Alex Jones YouTube channel for posting a video showing
the head of security for the San Antonio Federal Reserve saying that the
federal reserve building is,
private property
it is not a federal
building.
Clearly,
the globalists have spent billions of
dollars preparing for martial law.
Fortunately, the following tools will ensure
that their perverted dark military fantasy never comes becomes reality.
GLOBALIST SHUTDOWN
(Solutions)
A great example for defeating the fascist globalists and their plans to
impose martial law is Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement.
King and his supporters were so effective in
defeating tyranny, whether it be racial segregation, poverty, or the
senseless Vietnam War, that the government/globalists had to assassinate
him. Kings inspirational speeches are available online and his writings are
highly recommended.
Rather than one Martin Luther King Jr., we need a
million activists using his tools and spreading his message in their local
communities.
Education
Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny
and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the
dawn of day.
Thomas Jefferson
The globalists need secrecy to impose martial
law and increase the power of their fascist
world government.
That is why international bankster and
Bilderberger
David Rockefeller said:
it would have been impossible for us to
develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of
publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated
and prepared to march towards a world government
Educating others is to shine bright light on the
globalist cockroaches.
A great way to educate others is to deliver 50 flyers each weekend to the
front-door mats of your neighbors, which takes about 20 minutes. The flyer
should have summaries of important articles and the names of your favorite
alternative media websites. Leaving a flyer is an invitation for the reader
to do more research and learn for themselves (like
unschooling for adults).
People do not want activists like us telling
them how ignorant they are or this is how it really is. They need to
discover and decide for themselves. If you deliver 50 flyers per week, 40
weeks per year, you will reach 2,000 houses in one year.
Another great way to educate people is to email your contacts, friends, and
family members links to the weeks best articles every Friday. The title or
subject of your email can simply be, Check This Out.
Asking questions, like Socrates, is a fantastic way to educate people.
What
do you think of building 7? Oh, you havent heard of it. Ill email you a
link that will blow your mind.
What do you think of Rex 84? You havent heard
of it. Ill send you a link.
Boycott
Boycotting is one of the most affective tools for activists.
A classic
example is the Montgomery Bus Boycott, led by Martin Luther King, Jr.
lasting 385 days. The boycott campaign ended with a U.S. District Court
ruling in Browder v. Gayle that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery
public buses.
Activists that desire peace, equality, and prosperity for everyone should
boycott corporate sponsors of the
Council on Foreign Relations, also known
as Americas secret government. You have a right not to contract with
anyone.
Boycotting means:
-
not buying products or services from
these corporations
-
not working at these corporations
-
refusing to own shares of these
corporations
-
refusing to own mutual funds that invest
in shares of these corporations
As Tony Cartalucci said:
The system is only as corrupt as the amount
we continue paying into it.
We must
recognize the corporations lurking
behind this system, seen by many as benign or even beneficial to modern
America, and realize that they indisputably dominate both America
domestically and all that falls under American influence abroad.
Boycott
these corporations into destitution
and
replace them with local, decentralized, practical alternatives based
on real markets, real competition, real progress, and technological
innovation.
Enough people pulling their money out of the
bank and refusing to use debit cards or usurious credit cards would also
help end the fractional reserve banking scam.
Peaceful Protests
Peaceful protests are very effective at ending tyranny, as they show the
government and globalists that we are well aware of their crimes against us.
Protests also educate the public by forcing the
corporate media to cover important issues that they would prefer to ignore.
How could the Vietnam War continue with hundreds of
thousands of people
protesting in the heart of Washington D.C.?
After approximately 58,000 American and
1,366,000 Vietnamese unnecessary deaths, the people told the globalists that
they had had enough.
Likewise,
the image of draft card burning was a
powerful one. It appeared in magazines, newspapers and on television
Richard Nixon [globalist] ran for president in 1968 on a platform based
partly on putting an end to the draft, in order to undercut protesters
making use of the symbolic act. Nixon ended the draft in 1973, rendering
unnecessary the symbolic act of draft-card burning.
Today, we can make history by participating in
End the Federal Reserve protests, which in time will abolish that private
banking cartel and free the people from their debt enslavement.
The Federal Reserve allows the globalists to
create money out of nothing and loan it to the government at interest,
enslaving taxpayers with the national debt.
So far,
the corrupt government,
has paid its corporate masters $3 trillion keeping us safe after the 911
controlled demolitions. The IRS then collects income taxes to pay interest
on the national debt to the private federal reserve that created the money
it lent the government out of nothing.
The
Federal Reserve is owned by its largest
member banks and recently provided them with a $16.1 trillion dollar
bailout. Citigroup alone received $2.5 trillion as they continue to
foreclose on people's homes.
There is nothing more important to an informed
activist than ending the fascist private Federal Reserve along with its fiat
currency and fractional reserve banking system.
Civil Disobedience
Civil Disobedience, also known as
noncompliance, is the failure to obey a law that violates the
Constitution, natural law, or an individuals conscience.
For example, Arizona shut down its 4th Amendment
violating state-wide traffic camera program due to citizen noncompliance.
Cameras had been installed to monitor citizens driving and issue speeding
tickets
The
citizens won not by fighting the state, but by ignoring the State. The
State, as an institution, thrives on confrontation. The best antidote is
peaceful non-compliance. Simply ignore the State, disengage, and the State
is rendered impotent.
Through the highway camera system, it was hoped that an additional burst of
revenue would roll in. Instead, it became a massive drain on the state's
budget. Not only did it not bring in the hoped-for revenue, it didn't even
make enough money to pay for the expense of installing and maintaining the
cameras. The citizens simply ignored the tickets that arrived in the mail.
The state of Arizona doesn't have the money nor
the resources to follow up on the unpaid tickets.
Civil Disobedience (Resistance to Civil Government) is a famous essay by
American transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau. In it, Thoreau argues that
individuals should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their
consciences, and that they have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence
to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice.
Thoreau was
motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican-American War.
If a thousand [citizens] were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that
would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and
enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in
fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.
How does it become a man to behave toward this American government today? I
answered that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it.
Rosa Parks is famous for refusing to comply with the law requiring her to
give up her seat on the bus due to her skin color.
Sit-ins were an integral
part of the non-violent strategy of civil disobedience and mass protests
that eventually led to passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended
legally-sanctioned racial segregation in the United States.
Now is the time for you to refuse to submit to unjust laws and government
actions.
Dont let yourself or your
children be forcibly
vaccinated by government goons. Dont let the City tell you not to have
guests in your home. If the police
arrest you for feeding the homeless, keep
feeding them and ask others to join you.
Yes, you can dance in public if you want to.
Agape Love
Martin Luther King realized that
agape love is essential to bring about
positive social change.
Agape love is simply redemptive good will for
all men and women. If you truly love your spouse, children, family friends,
neighbors, and humanity itself, you will take action to reverse mankinds
incremental enslavement. An important aspect is telling others the truth,
even when the truth is not pleasant to hear.
Agape love also requires that you not allow
yourself to hate the global elite and their agents despite their history of
unspeakable crimes against humanity. Of course, agape love does not imply
that the global elite should not be arrested, tried by an impartial jury,
convicted, and imprisoned for their crimes.
By implementing these tools of freedom daily, we will ensure that the
globalists plans and drills for martial law in American never amount to
more than a total waste of time and money.
