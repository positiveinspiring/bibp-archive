# Obama Moves to Make The 'War on Terror' Permanent

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_obama117.htm

A primary reason for opposing the
acquisition of abusive powers and civil liberties erosions is that they
virtually always become permanent, vested not only in current leaders
one may love and trust but also future officials who seem more menacing
and less benign.
The Washington Post has a
crucial and disturbing story this morning by
Greg Miller about the
concerted efforts by the
Obama administration to fully institutionalize - to make officially
permanent - the most extremist powers it has exercised in the name of
the war on terror.
Based on interviews with,
"current and former
officials from the White House and the Pentagon, as well as intelligence
and counterterrorism agencies", Miller reports that as "the
United States' conventional wars are winding down", the Obama
administration "expects to continue adding names to kill or capture
lists for years" (the "capture" part of that list is little more than
symbolic, as the US focus is
overwhelmingly on the "kill" part).
Specifically,
"among senior
Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such
operations are likely to be extended at least another decade."
As Miller
puts it:
"That timeline suggests that the United States has reached only
the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism."
In pursuit of this goal,
"White House
counterterrorism adviser John O Brennan is seeking to codify the
administration's approach to generating capture/kill lists, part of a
broader effort to guide future administrations through the
counterterrorism processes that Obama has embraced."
All of this, writes
Miller, demonstrates,
"the extent to which Obama has institutionalized
the highly classified practice of targeted killing, transforming ad-hoc
elements into a counterterrorism infrastructure capable of sustaining a
seemingly permanent war."
The Post article cites numerous recent
developments reflecting this Obama effort, including the fact that,
"CIA
Director David H Petraeus is pushing for an expansion of the agency's
fleet of armed drones", which "reflects the agency's transformation into
a paramilitary force, and makes clear that it does not intend to
dismantle its drone program and return to its pre-September 11 focus on
gathering intelligence."
The article also describes rapid expansion of
commando operations by the US Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC)
and, perhaps most disturbingly, the creation of a permanent bureaucratic
infrastructure to allow the president to assassinate at will:
"JSOC also has established a secret
targeting center across the Potomac River from Washington, current
and former U.S. officials said. The elite command's targeting cells
have traditionally been located near the front lines of its
missions, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But JSOC created a
'national capital region' task force that is a 15-minute commute
from the White House so it could be more directly involved in
deliberations about al-Qaeda lists."
The creepiest aspect of this development is
the christening of a new Orwellian euphemism for due-process-free
presidential assassinations:
"disposition matrix".
Writes Miller:
"Over the past two years, the Obama
administration has been secretly developing a new blueprint for
pursuing terrorists, a next-generation targeting list called the
'disposition matrix'.
"The matrix contains the names of
terrorism suspects arrayed against an accounting of the resources
being marshaled to track them down, including sealed indictments and
clandestine operations. US officials said the database is designed
to go beyond existing kill lists, mapping plans for the
'disposition' of suspects beyond the reach of American drones."
The "disposition matrix" has been developed
and will be overseen by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).
One
of its purposes is "to augment" the "separate but overlapping kill
lists" maintained by the CIA and the Pentagon: to serve, in other words,
as the centralized clearinghouse for determining who will be executed
without due process based upon how one fits into the executive branch's
"matrix".
As Miller describes it, it is "a single, continually evolving
database" which includes,
"biographies, locations, known associates and
affiliated organizations" as well as "strategies for taking targets
down, including extradition requests, capture operations and drone
patrols".
This analytical system that determines people's "disposition"
will undoubtedly be kept completely secret.
Marcy Wheeler
sardonically said that she was,
"looking forward to the government's
arguments explaining why it won't release the disposition matrix to ACLU
under FOIA".
This was all motivated by Obama's refusal to
arrest or detain terrorist suspects, and his resulting commitment simply
to killing them at will (his will).
Miller quotes "a former US
counterterrorism official involved in developing the matrix" as
explaining the impetus behind the program this way:
"We had a
disposition problem."
The central role played by the NCTC in
determining who should be killed - "It is the keeper of the criteria,"
says one official to the Post - is, by itself, rather odious.
As Kade
Crockford of the ACLU of Massachusetts
noted in response to this story,
the ACLU
has long warned that the real purpose of the NCTC - despite its
nominal focus on terrorism - is the,
"massive, secretive data collection
and mining of trillions of points of data about most people in the
United States".
In particular, the NCTC operates a gigantic
data-mining operation, in which all sorts of information about innocent
Americans is systematically monitored, stored, and analyzed.
This
includes,
"records from law enforcement investigations, health
information, employment history, travel and student records" -
"literally anything the government collects would be fair game".
In
other words, the NCTC - now vested with the power to determine the
proper "disposition" of terrorist suspects - is the same agency that is
at the center of the ubiquitous, unaccountable surveillance state aimed
at American citizens.
Worse still, as the ACLU's legislative
counsel Chris Calabrese documented back in July
in a must-read analysis, Obama officials very recently abolished
safeguards on how this information can be used.
Whereas the agency,
during the Bush years, was barred from storing non-terrorist-related
information about innocent Americans for more than 180 days - a limit
which "meant that NCTC was dissuaded from collecting large databases
filled with information on innocent Americans" - it is now free to do
so.
Obama officials eliminated this constraint by authorizing the NCTC,
"to collect and 'continually assess' information on innocent Americans
for up to five years".
And, as usual, this agency engages in these
incredibly powerful and invasive processes with virtually no democratic
accountability:
"All of this is happening with very
little oversight.
Controls over the NCTC are mostly internal to the
DNI's office, and important oversight bodies such as Congress and
the President's Intelligence Oversight Board aren't notified even of
'significant' failures to comply with the Guidelines. Fundamental
legal protections are being sidestepped.
For example, under the new
guidelines, Privacy Act notices (legal requirements to describe how
databases are used) must be completed by the agency that collected
the information. This is in spite of the fact that those agencies
have no idea what NCTC is actually doing with the information once
it collects it.
"All of this amounts to a reboot of the
Total Information Awareness Program that Americans rejected so
vigorously right after 9/11."
It doesn't require any conspiracy theorizing
to see what's happening here. Indeed, it takes extreme naivet√©, or
wilful blindness, not to see it.
What has been created here - permanently
institutionalized - is a highly secretive executive branch agency that
simultaneously engages in two functions:
-
it collects and analyzes
massive amounts of surveillance data about all Americans without any
judicial review let alone search warrants
-
creates and
implements a "matrix" that determines the "disposition" of suspects, up
to and including execution, without a whiff of due process or oversight
It is simultaneously a surveillance state and a secretive, unaccountable
judicial body that analyzes who you are and then decrees what should be
done with you, how you should be "disposed" of, beyond the reach of any
minimal accountability or transparency.
The Post's Miller recognizes the watershed
moment this represents:
"The creation of the matrix and the
institutionalization of kill/capture lists reflect a shift that is as
psychological as it is strategic."
As he explains, extra-judicial
assassination was once deemed so extremist that very extensive
deliberations were required before Bill Clinton could target even Osama
bin Laden for death by lobbing cruise missiles in East Africa.
But:
Targeted killing is now so routine that
the Obama administration has spent much of the past year codifying
and streamlining the processes that sustain it.
To understand the Obama legacy, please
re-read that sentence.
As Murtaza Hussain
put
it when reacting to the Post story:
"The US agonized over the
targeted killing Bin Laden at Tarnak Farms in 1998; now it kills people
it barely suspects of anything on a regular basis."
The pragmatic inanity of the mentality
driving this is self-evident: as I
discussed yesterday (and many other times), continuous killing does
not eliminate violence aimed at the US but rather guarantees its
permanent expansion.
As a result, wrote Miller,
"officials said no clear
end is in sight" when it comes to the war against "terrorists" because,
said one official, "we can't possibly kill everyone who wants to harm
us" but trying is "a necessary part of what we do". Of course, the more
the US kills and kills and kills, the more people there are who "want to
harm us".
That's the logic that has resulted in a permanent war on
terror.
But even more significant is the truly
radical vision of government in which this is all grounded. The core
guarantee of western justice since the Magna Carta was codified in the
US by the
fifth
amendment to the constitution:
"No person shall... be deprived of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."
You simply
cannot have a free society, a worthwhile political system, without that
guarantee, that constraint on the ultimate abusive state power, being
honored.
And yet what the Post is describing, what we
have had for years, is a system of government that - without hyperbole -
is the very antithesis of that liberty.
It is literally impossible to
imagine a more violent repudiation of the basic blueprint of the
republic than the development of a secretive, totally unaccountable
executive branch agency that simultaneously collects information about
all citizens and then applies a "disposition matrix" to determine what
punishment should be meted out.
This is classic political dystopia
brought to reality (despite how compelled such a conclusion is by these
indisputable facts, many Americans will view such a claim as an
exaggeration, paranoia, or worse because of
this psychological dynamic I described here which leads many good
passive westerners to believe that true oppression, by definition, is
something that happens only elsewhere).
In response to the Post story, Chris Hayes
asked:
"If you have a 'kill list', but the list keeps growing, are
you succeeding?"
The answer all depends upon what the objective is.
As the Founders all recognized, nothing
vests elites with power - and profit - more than a state of war. That is
why there were supposed to be substantial barriers to having them start
and continue - the need for a Congressional declaration, the
constitutional bar on funding the military for more than two years
at a time, the prohibition on standing armies, etc.
Here is how John Jay
put it in
Federalist No 4:
"It is too true, however disgraceful it
may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war
whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay,
absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get
nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal,
such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts,
ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their
particular families or partisans.
These and a variety of other
motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him
to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and
interests of his people."
In sum, there are factions in many
governments that crave a state of endless war because that is when power
is least constrained and profit most abundant.
What the Post is
reporting is yet another significant step toward that state, and it is
undoubtedly driven, at least on the part of some, by a self-interested
desire to ensure the continuation of endless war and the powers and
benefits it vests.
So to answer Hayes' question: the endless expansion
of a kill list and the unaccountable, always-expanding powers needed to
implement it does indeed represent a great success for many.
Read what
John Jay wrote in the above passage to see why that is, and why few, if
any, political developments should be regarded as more pernicious.
Detention policies
Assuming the Post's estimates are correct -
that "among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad
consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least
another decade" - this means that the war on terror will last for more
than 20 years, far longer than any other American war.
This is what has
always made the rationale for indefinite detention - that it is
permissible to detain people without due process until the "end of
hostilities" - so warped in this context.
Those who are advocating that
are endorsing nothing less than life imprisonment - permanent
incarceration - without any charges or opportunities to contest the
accusations.
That people are
now dying at Guantanamo after almost a decade in a cage with no
charges highlights just how repressive that power is.
Extend that
mentality to secret, due-process-free assassinations - something the US
government clearly intends to convert into a permanent fixture of
American political life - and it is not difficult to see just how truly
extremist and anti-democratic "war on terror" proponents in both
political parties have become.
UPDATE
As I noted yesterday, Afghan officials
reported that three Afghan children were killed on Saturday by NATO
operations.
Today,
reports CNN,
"missiles blew up part of a compound Wednesday in
northwest Pakistan, killing three people - including one woman" and
added: "the latest suspected U.S. drone strike also injured two
children."
Meanwhile, former Obama press secretary and current campaign
adviser Robert Gibbs
this week justified the
US killing of 16-year-old American Abdulrahaman Awlaki, killed by a
US drone in Yemen two weeks after his father was, on the ground that he,
"should have a far more responsible father".
Also yesterday,
CNN profiled Abu Sufyan Said al-Shihri, alleged to be a top al-Qaida
official in Yemen.
He pointed out,
"that U.S. drone strikes are helping
al-Qaida in Yemen because of the number of civilian deaths they cause."
Ample evidence supports his observation.
To summarize all this: the US does not
interfere in the Muslim world and maintain an endless war on terror
because of the terrorist threat. It has a terrorist threat because of
its interference in the Muslim world and its endless war on terror.
UPDATE II
The
Council on Foreign Relations'
Micah Zenko, writing today about the Post article,
reports:
"Recently, I spoke to a military
official with extensive and wide-ranging experience in the special
operations world, and who has had direct exposure to the targeted
killing program (below video).
To emphasize how easy targeted killings by special
operations forces or drones has become, this official flicked his
hand back over and over, stating:
'It really is like swatting flies.
We can do it forever easily and you feel nothing. But how often do
you really think about killing a fly?'"
That is disturbingly consistent with
prior reports that the military's term for drone victims is "bug
splat".
This - this warped power and the accompanying dehumanizing
mindset - is what is being institutionalized as a permanent fixture in
American political life by the current president.
UPDATE III
At Wired, Spencer Ackerman reacts to the
Post article with
an
analysis entitled "President Romney Can Thank Obama for His
Permanent Robotic Death List".
Here is his concluding paragraph:
"Obama did not run for president to
preside over the codification of a global war fought in secret. But
that's his legacy...
Micah Zenko at the Council on Foreign
Relations writes that Obama's predecessors in the Bush
administration 'were actually much more conscious and thoughtful
about the long-term implications of targeted killings', because they
feared the political consequences that might come when the U.S.
embraces something at least superficially similar to assassination.
Whoever follows Obama in the Oval Office can thank him for proving
those consequences don't meaningfully exist - as he or she reviews
the backlog of names on the Disposition Matrix."
It's worth devoting a moment to letting that
sink in.
