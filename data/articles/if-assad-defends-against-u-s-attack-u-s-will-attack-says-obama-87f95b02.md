Only hours after delivering his
ridiculous address to the American people regarding his strategy to
combat an organization that is entirely the product of the United States and
NATO and one that is still under complete control of these powers, Obama
conducted a meeting with "foreign policy experts," former government
officials, and journalists.
The meeting, of course, is nothing more than round two in the volley of
propaganda coming from the White House in its attempt to drum up more
support from the American people for direct
military intervention in Syria
and an open use of U.S. military forces against the secular government of
Bashar al-Assad.
All of those within an ear's reach of the
reports regarding Obama's meeting should be firmly aware that it is nothing
more than an attempt to milk the original speech for more propaganda against
Assad's Syria and provide a sense of inevitability about the coming conflict
there.
With that in mind,
Obama stated to those in the "after party" meeting, that if the Syrian
government were to shoot down American military planes - American military
planes engaging in aggressive air strikes on Syrian soil - then the United
States would be forced to "wipe out" Syria's air defenses.
Obama also added
that an attack against the Syrian air defenses would be a much easier task
than attacking
his pet ISIS terrorists and other related groups. Obama
pointed out that eliminating Syria's air defense capabilities would lead to
his ouster and the overthrow of the Syrian government.
Essentially, Obama stated that the United States would violate Syrian
sovereignty by launching airstrikes inside Syria allegedly for the purpose
of bombing the terrorist group that was created, funded, and directed by the
United States to overthrow the Syrian government.
If Assad dares to defend
his country against both an American destabilization of terrorism and
aggressive American airstrikes, then the United States would retaliate
against Assad's retaliation.
Assad has been defending Syria from an American attack since as far back as
2011 in earnest and even further back in terms of the roots and
implementation of the strategy.
It is interesting to note that the U.S. and NATO should be so interested in
Syria's air defenses at the same time that the death squads have focused on
the
Taqba Airbase in Raqqa province.
Particularly when viewed in context of
the recent goal of engaging in targeted airstrikes inside Syria.
For those who may not
see the pattern - while the United States and NATO deliberated engaging
in targeted airstrikes in Syria, and the Syrian government subsequently
states its opposition to those attacks and its intentions to shoot down the
planes delivering those strikes if they do not coordinate with the Syrian
government, death squads have effectively eliminated the air defense
capability of the Syrian government in the east of the country.
After all, the Pentagon even stated that
one of the biggest threats to an airstrike operation in Syria is the
Syrian government's air defenses. Thanks to ISIS, those air defenses no
longer exist in the east of Syria.
This was the end game of the ISIS battle to take over Taqba from the start -
eliminate air defenses so that the NATO powers can launch airstrikes against
the Syrian military and thus freeing up a launching pad for the terrorists
to conduct attacks even deeper into Syria.
It is important to point out that the Islamic State is not some shadowy
force that emerged from the caves of Afghanistan to form an effective
military force that is funded by Twitter donations and murky secretive
finance deals.
IS is entirely the
creation of NATO and the West and it
remains in control of the organization.
As Tony Cartalucci writes in his article "Implausible
Deniability - West's ISIS Terror Hordes in Iraq,"
Beginning in 2011 - and actually even as
early as 2007 - the United States has been arming, funding, and
supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and a myriad of armed terrorist
organizations to overthrow the government of Syria, fight Hezbollah in
Lebanon, and undermine the power and influence of Iran, which of course
includes any other government or group in the MENA region friendly
toward Tehran.
Billions in cash have been funneled into the
hands of terrorist groups including Al Nusra, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI),
and what is now being called "Islamic State in Iraq and Syria" or ISIS.
One can see clearly by any map of ISIS held territory that it butts up
directly against Turkey's borders with defined corridors ISIS uses to
invade southward - this is because it is precisely from NATO territory
this terrorist scourge originated.
ISIS was harbored on NATO territory, armed
and funded by US CIA agents with cash and weapons brought in from the
Saudis, Qataris, and NATO members themselves. The "non-lethal aid" the
US and British sent
including the vehicles we now see ISIS driving around in.
They didn't "take" this gear from
"moderates." There were never any moderates to begin with.
The deadly
sectarian genocide we now see unfolding was long ago predicted by those
in the Pentagon - current and former officials - interviewed in 2007 by
Pulitzer Prize-winning veteran
journalist Seymour Hersh.
Hersh's 9-page 2007 report, "The
Redirection" states explicitly:
To undermine Iran, which is
predominantly Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in
effect, to reconfigure its priorities in the Middle East.
In
Lebanon, the Administration has cooperated with Saudi Arabia's
government, which is Sunni, in clandestine operations that are
intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite organization that is backed
by Iran.
The U.S. has also taken part in clandestine operations
aimed at Iran and its ally Syria.
A by-product of these activities
has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a
militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and sympathetic
to Al Qaeda.
"Extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of Islam" and are
"sympathetic to Al Qaeda" - is a verbatim definition of what ISIS is today.
Clearly the words of Seymour Hersh were as prophetic as they were factually
informed, grounded in the reality of a regional conflict already engineered
and taking shape as early as 2007. Hersh's report would also forewarn the
sectarian nature of the coming conflict, and in particular mention the
region's Christians who were admittedly being protected by Hezbollah.
While Hersh's report was written in 2007, knowledge of the plan to use death
squads to target Middle Eastern countries, particularly Syria, had been
reported on even as far back as 2005 by Michael Hirsh and John Barry for
Newsweek in an article entitled "The
Salvador Option."
Regardless, Cartalucci states in a separate article, "NATO's
Terror Hordes in Iraq a Pretext for Syria Invasion,"
In actuality, ISIS is the product of a joint
NATO-GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] conspiracy stretching back as far as
2007 where US-Saudi policymakers sought to ignite a region-wide
sectarian war to purge the Middle East of Iran's arch of influence
stretching from its borders, across Syria and Iraq, and as far west as
Lebanon and the coast of the Mediterranean.
ISIS has been harbored,
trained, armed, and extensively funded by a coalition of NATO and
Persian Gulf states within Turkey's (NATO territory) borders and has
launched invasions into northern Syria with, at times, both Turkish
artillery and air cover.
The most recent example of this was the
cross-border invasion by Al Qaeda into Kasab village, Latikia province
in northwest Syria.
Cartalucci is referring to a
cross-border invasion that was
coordinated with NATO, Turkey, Israel, and the death squads where Israel
acted as air force cover while Turkey facilitated the death squad invasion
from inside its own borders.
Keep in mind also that, prior to the rapid appearance and seizure of
territory by ISIS in Syria and Iraq, European media outlets like
Der Spiegel reported that hundreds of fighters were being trained in
Jordan by Western intelligence and military personnel for the purpose of
deployment in Syria to fight against Assad.
The numbers were said to be
expected to reach about 10,000 fighters when the reports were issued in
March, 2013.
Although Western and European media outlets would try to spin
the operation as the training of "moderate rebels," subsequent reports
revealed that these fighters
were actually ISIS fighters.
Western media outlets have also gone to great lengths to spin the fact that
ISIS is operating in both Syria and Iraq with an alarming number of American
weapons and equipment.
As Business Insiderstated,
"The report [study by the London-based small
arms research organization Conflict Armament Research] said the jihadists
disposed of 'significant quantities' of US-made small arms including M16
assault rifles and included photos showing the markings 'Property of US Govt'."
The article also acknowledged that a large number of the weapons
used by ISIS were provided by Saudi Arabia, a close American ally.
In the end, Barack Obama's statements of aggression and duplicity should
come as no surprise to informed observers.
The Western-backed terrorist
organization known as ISIS is being used as an excuse to continue American
Imperialism in the Middle East and to justify a military strike on Syria.
