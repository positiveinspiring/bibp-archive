The Empire will stop at nothing to find mechanisms and techniques to achieve
its final objective, and we cannot disregard the possibility of a military
conflict in the near future. If the US places Venezuela on the terrorist
list this year, we could be on the verge of a regional war.
Latin America has suffered constant aggressions executed by Washington
during the past two hundred years.
Strategies and tactics of covert and overt
warfare have been applied against different nations in the region, ranging
from,
Regardless of whos in the White House
democrat or republican when it comes to Latin America, the Empires
policies remain the same.
In the twenty-first century, Venezuela has been one of the principle targets
of these constant aggressions.
Since the April 2002 coup, there has been a
dangerous escalation in attacks and destabilization attempts against the
Bolivarian Revolution. Although many fell beneath the seductive smile
and poetic words of
Barack Obama, its not necessary to
look beyond the past year to see the intensification of Washingtons
aggressions against Venezuela.
The largest military expansion in history in the
region through the US occupation of Colombia the reactivation of the
Fourth Fleet of the US Navy, as well as an increased US military presence in
the Caribbean, Panama and Central America throughout the past year, can be
interpreted as preparation for a conflict scenario in the region.
Escalation in
Aggressions
The hostile declarations from various Washington representatives during the
past few weeks, accusing Venezuela of failure to combat narcotics
operations, violating human rights, not contributing to democracy and
regional stability, and of being the regional anti-US leader, form part
of a coordinated campaign that seeks to justify a direct aggression against
Venezuela.
Soon, Washington will publish its annual list of
state sponsors of terrorism, and if Venezuela is placed on the list this
year, the region could be on the brink of an unprecedented military
conflict.
Evidence seems to indicate a move in that direction.
A US Air Force document justifying the need to
increase military presence in Colombia affirmed that
Washington is preparing for expeditionary warfare in South America.
The 2009 Air Force document, sent to Congress last May (but later modified
in November after it was used to demonstrate the true intentions behind the
military agreement between the US and Colombia), explained,
Development of this CSL (Cooperative
Security Location) will further the strategic partnership forged between
the US and Colombia and is in the interest of both nations... A presence
will also increase our capability to conduct Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), improve global reach, support
logistics requirements, improve partnerships, improve theater security
cooperation and expand expeditionary warfare capability.
On the Verge of War
The first official report outlining the defense and intelligence priorities
of the Obama administration dedicated substantial attention to Venezuela.
The Annual Threat Assessment of the US
Intelligence Community which has mentioned Venezuela in years past,
but not nearly with the same emphasis and extension particularly signaled
out President Chavez as a major threat to US interests.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has
established himself as one of the USs foremost international
detractors, denouncing liberal democracy and market capitalism and
opposing US policies and interests in the region, said the intelligence
document, placing Venezuela in the same category as Iran, North Korea
and Al Qaida.
Days after the report was published, the State
Department presented its 2011 budget to Congress.
In addition to an increase in financing through
USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED)
to fund opposition groups in Venezuela more than $15 million USD there
was also a $48 million USD request for the Organization of American
States (OAS)
to,
deploy special democracy promoter teams
to countries where democracy is under threat from the growing presence
of alternative concepts such as the participatory democracy promoted
by Venezuela and Bolivia.
One week later, the Inter-American Human
Rights Commission of the OAS funded by Washington emitted a whopping
322-page report slamming Venezuela for human rights violations, repression
of the press and undermining democracy.
Despite the fact that it was a report and a
Commission dedicated to the topic of human rights, the detailed
study barely mentioned the immense achievements of the Chavez government in
advancing human rights; advances which have been recognized and applauded
over the past five years by the
United Nations.
The evidence used by the OAS to elaborate the
report came from opposition testimonies and biased media outlets, a clear
demonstration of dangerous subjectivity.
Simultaneous to these accusations, a Spanish court accused the Venezuelan
government last week of supporting and collaborating with the FARC and ETA
organizations considered terrorist by both the US and Spain provoking an
international scandal.
President Chavez reiterated that his government
has absolutely no ties with any terrorist group in the world.
This is a government of peace, declared
Chavez, after explaining that the presence of ETA members in Venezuela
is due to an agreement made over 20 years ago by the government
of Carlos Andres Perez in order to aid Spain in a peace treaty with the
Basque separatist group.
The Empire Has No Color
Last week, on tour in Latin America, US Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton couldnt stop attacking Venezuela during her different
declarations made before international media.
She expressed her great concern for democracy
and human rights in Venezuela, accusing President Chavez of not
contributing in a constructive manner to regional progress.
In a cynical tone, Clinton advised President
Chavez to look further south for inspiration, instead of towards Cuba.
Clintons regional trip was part of a strategy announced by the Obama
administration last year, to create a divide between the so-called
progressive left and the radical left in Latin America.
Its no coincidence that her first tour of the
region coincided with the announcement of a new Latin American and Caribbean
Community of States, which excludes the presence of the US and Canada.
The Coming Conflict
A military conflict is not initiated from one day to the next. Its a
process that involves first influencing public perception and opinion
demonizing the target leader or government in order to justify aggression.
Subsequently, armed forces are strategically
deployed in the region in order to guarantee an effective military action.
Tactics, such as subversion and counterinsurgency, are utilized in order to
debilitate and destabilize the target nation from within, increasing its
vulnerability and weakening its defenses.
This plan has been active against Venezuela for several years. The
consolidation of regional unity and Latin American integration threatens US
possibilities of regaining domination and control in the hemisphere. And the
advances of the
Bolivarian Revolution have impeded its
self-destruction, provoked by internal subversion funded and directed by
US agencies.
However, the Empire will not cease its
attempts to achieve its final objective, and a potential military conflict
in the region remains on the horizon.
