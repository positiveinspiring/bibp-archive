Leaked documents from the 1955 Bilderberg Group conference held in Germany
discuss the agenda to create a European Union and a single EU currency,
decades before they were introduced, disproving once again debunkers who
claim that Bilderberg has no influence over world events.
Leaked papers from the meeting which took place from September 23-25 1955 at
the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany, were
released by
the Wikileaks website yesterday.
As we first reported in 2003, a BBC investigative team were allowed to
access Bilderberg files which confirmed that the EU and the Euro were the
brainchild of Bilderberg (below audio):
They were probably reading from the same documents
that were released by Wikileaks.
It was only last month that Belgian viscount and current Bilderberg-chairman
Étienne Davignon
bragged that Bilderberg helped create the Euro by first
introducing the policy agenda for a single currency in the early 1990′s.
However, the documents show that the agenda to create a European common
market and a single currency go back decades earlier.
The summary report of the 1955 meeting talks of the,
Pressing need to bring
the German people, together with the other peoples of Europe, into a common
market.
The document also outlines the plan,
To arrive in the shortest possible
time at the highest degree of integration, beginning with a common European
market.
Just two years later, in 1957, the first incarnation of the European
Economic Community (EEC) was born, which comprised of a single market
between Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
The
EEC gradually enlarged over the next few decades until it became the
European Community, one of the three pillars of the European Union, which
was officially created in 1993.
The 1955 Bilderberg summary outlines a consensus that,
It might be better
to proceed through the development of a common market by treaty rather than
by the creation of new high authorities.
The EEC was duly created via the
Treaty of Rome, which was signed on 25 March 1957.
The same process is still being followed to this day with the Lisbon Treaty,
which hands over vast swathes of national sovereignty to the EU by means of
the consent of Presidents and Prime Ministers of European countries, rather
than by the arbitrary creation of new authorities, a method that would more
obviously lay bare the fact that the creation of a federal EU super-state is
totalitarian by its very nature.
Even so, debunkers will probably still try and claim that the idea of a
common European market was floating around in the early 1950′s and that
Bilderberg were merely debating contemporary political ideas.
However, the same cannot be said for the single European currency, which
wasnt even introduced in the form of notes and coins until January 2002,
having been first codified in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty.
The documents
prove that Bilderberg members were pushing for its introduction nearly 40
years earlier.
A European speaker expressed concern about the need to achieve a common
currency, and indicated that in his view this necessarily implied the
creation of a central political authority, states the summary document.
True to form, the single European currency, the Euro, was not introduced
until after the creation of a central political authority - the EU itself.
The document also stresses,
The necessity to bring the German people into a
common European market as quickly as possible, adding that the future was
in danger without a United Europe.
We also learn that,
A United States participant confirmed that the United
States had not weakened in its enthusiastic support for the idea of
integration, although there was considerable diffidence in America as to how
this enthusiasm should be manifested.
Another United States participant
urged his European friends to go ahead with the unification of Europe with
less emphasis on ideological considerations and, above all, to be practical
and work fast.
Despite the
plethora of manifestly provable examples of where Bilderbergs
agenda has later played out in actual policies and geopolitical developments
on the world stage, establishment media debunkers still scoff and sneer at
independent researchers who dare claim that 150 of the worlds most
influential powerbrokers meeting in secret to discuss the future of the
planet might equate to something more than an informal talking shop, calling
such assertions conspiracy theories.
Indeed, the sheer stupidity of debunkers to suggest that an event that
attracts the titans of,
-
government
-
industry
-
banking
-
business
-
academia,
...at which the most pressing global issues of the day are vigorously discussed
under the cloak of a mutually agreed media blackout, has no bearing on
future world events, is the most laughable conspiracy theory ever uttered.
Bilderbergs 2009 agenda has already been leaked before their May 14-17
meeting in Vouliagmeni, Greece.
According to investigative journalist Daniel Estulin, one of Bilderbergs aims is to smear anti-Lisbon Treaty activists
and politicians by planting derogatory stories in the media, enabling them
to silence opposition to an EU federal super-state that Bilderberg has been
carefully cultivating since their very first meetings in the 1950′s - a
fact, not a conspiracy theory, proven by
Bilderbergs own internal
documents.
