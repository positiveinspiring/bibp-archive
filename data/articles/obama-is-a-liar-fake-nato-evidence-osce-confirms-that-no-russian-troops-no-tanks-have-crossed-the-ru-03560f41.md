# Obama is a Liar - Fake NATO Evidence - OSCE Confirms that No Russian 
Troops, No Tanks, have Crossed the Russia-Ukraine Border

"Throughout the week, the Observer
Teams noticed a net increase of young people (both men and women)
wearing military-style dress crossing the border in both directions
but did not observe any weapons among these groups," the OSCE
Special Monitoring Missions report covering a period from August 20
to September 3 said.
The observers said they had regular
interactions with supporters of the self-proclaimed republics.
"Some discussed openly with the OSCE
while others expressed their total mistrust toward the OSCE. At both
Border Crossing Points, some supporters of the self-proclaimed
republics explained that they are not allowed to cross the border
with weapons," the report said.
The observers registered a decrease in
helicopter sightings compared to last week but they were still observed
at border crossing points flying at low altitude along the border.
"In either case, in as far as could be
seen, the aircraft did not violate the Ukrainian airspace," the
report said. (Ibid)
The OSCE Observer Mission is deployed at the
Russian Checkpoints of Gukovo and Donetsk at the request of Russias
government.
The decision was taken in a consensus
agreement by all 57
OSCE participating States, many of
which are represented at the NATO Summit in Wales.
The OSCE report contradicts the statements
made by the Kiev regime and its US-NATO sponsors. It confirms that NATO
accusations pertaining to the influx of Russian tanks are an outright
fabrication.
NATO backed up Obamas statements with
"fake" satellite images (28 August 2014) that allegedly,
"show Russian combat forces engaged in
military operations inside the sovereign territory of Ukraine".
These statements are refuted by a detailed
report of the OSCE monitoring mission stationed at the Russia-Ukraine
border. The NATO reports including its satellite photos were based on
fake evidence.
It is worth noting that the OSCE carefully
categorizes movements across the border, which largely consist of
refugees:
Cross-border movements common to both Border Crossing
Points
The profile of the people crossing the
border remains unchanged and can be categorized as follows:
-
Families on foot or by car with a
lot of luggage
-
Elderly people with few bags
-
Adults (usually of younger age) with
no luggage or empty cars
-
People wearing military-style
clothes with or without backpacks
While the number of entries/exits has
remained stable at an average of 6,523 per day for both Border Crossing
Points, the OM has observed a clear reversal in the flow of people
crossing the border.
Since August 26, the majority of border
crossers have been going back into Ukraine with an average net flow of
minus 429 per day for both Border Crossing Points in the last week and
since that day 3,857 people have returned to Ukraine through both Border
Crossing Points.
The statistics also show that the Donetsk
Border Crossing Point consistently experiences more traffic than the
Gukovo Border Crossing Point. The cross-border movements registered at
both Border Crossing Points account for 43 percent of all the Rostov
Regions entries/exits.
The OM continued to observe a general trend
of very low cross-border traffic during the night hours. At sunrise the
number of travellers slowly increases until late morning. Then, the
traffic flow decreases but rises towards the late afternoon and evening.
The majority of the vehicles crossing the
border have number plates issued in the Luhansk region.
Common observations at the Border Crossing Points
In general, the situation at both Border
Crossing Points is calm.
People crossing the border talk to the
Observer Teams (OTs) regularly and continue to describe the situation in
the Luhansk region as dire. The OTs continued to receive numerous
accounts of severe destruction caused by artillery fire which resulted
in the interruption of water, gas and electricity supplies, the latter
apparently unavailable for more than five weeks in some areas including
Luhansk city itself.
Throughout the week, the OTs noticed a net
increase of young people (both men and women) wearing military-style
dress crossing the border in both directions but did not observe any
weapons among these groups.
OTs had regular interactions with supporters
of the self-proclaimed republics. Some discussed openly with the OSCE
while others expressed their total mistrust toward the OSCE. At both
Border Crossing Points, some supporters of the self-proclaimed republics
explained that they are not allowed to cross the border with weapons.
However, on the other side, there are
organized places where they receive weapons, ammunition and equipment
and are dispatched to their assigned areas on the Ukrainian side. Upon
return, they hand over weapons, ammunition and other military equipment
and cross back into the Russian Federation. In the case of Gukovo, there
is even a firing range to calibre the newly-received weapons before
continuing to the frontlines.
As described in previous reports, on a daily
basis OTs hear such range-like shootings on Ukrainian territory at a
short distance from the Gukovo Border Crossing Point.
The OTs observed more people wearing black
t-shirts with the inscription "Novorossiya" (new Russia") or "Luhansk
Peoples Republic" with corresponding flags. In some instances, this
flag was also observed on several civilian vehicles windshields and
license plates.
Civilian people stopping to discuss with OTs
often ask the OSCE to stop the conflict and to record and report their
testimonies so that everybody can be aware of the situation.
Military movement
Throughout the week, day and night, the OTs
heard the sound of propeller aircrafts in the vicinity of the Border
Crossing Points.
During daylight and when the weather
conditions were favourable, the OTs observed the same small grey
aircrafts identified as UAVs. The same flight patterns were observed at
both Border Crossing Points. The UAVs were following a flight path
assessed to be at the edge of the Ukrainian border on very regular
schedules with intervals varying from 18 to 25 minutes. In several
instances, up to two UAVs were observed in the same area at the same
time.
There was a decrease in helicopter sightings
compared to last week but they were still observed at both Border
Crossing Points flying at low altitude along the border.
In either case, in as far as could be seen,
the aircrafts did not violate the Ukrainian airspace in the vicinity of
the Border Crossing Points.
Observation at the Gukovo Border Crossing Point
The traffic flow at Gukovo BCP has remained
steady compared to last week, with a slight decrease in the past two
days.
A daily average of 2,940 entries and exits
was recorded, which accounted for 19 percent of all entries/exits into
the Rostov Region. The average number of people entering the Russian
Federation has diminished consistently during the reporting period and
the net flow has been negative since 26 August with a daily average of
minus 262.
This statistic clearly reflects a return
movement into Ukraine. In the past week, close to 2,000 people have
returned to Ukraine through the Gukovo Border Crossing Point each day.
Throughout the week, the OTs continued to
hear gunfire on the Ukrainian side very close to the Border Crossing
Point.
As described earlier, these fire incidents
were assessed as not combat-related, reportedly originating from a
nearby improvised shooting range under the control of supporters of
the self-proclaimed republics.
Reports of people at the Gukovo Border Crossing Point
OTs received reports from people of
Sverdlovsk (17 km west of Gukovo Border Crossing Point) about the towns
situation.
They reported that the town had not
experienced direct fights but five houses were destroyed. Although
public transport and the only hospital were functioning, for the past
two-and-a-half months, there was no water.
According to them, pensions and social
benefits were not paid and people could not access money. Prices for
common goods had increased considerably and therefore people were going
to the Russian Federation every three to four days to buy first
necessity products and to obtain cash at ATMs or banks.
People reported that the school year was
planned to start on 1 September but they did not want their children to
follow Ukrainian curricula.
Observation at the Donetsk Border Crossing Point
During the reporting period, the activity at
the Donetsk Border Crossing Point has slightly increased compared to
last week.
The total number of border crossings at
Donetsk Border Crossing Point consistently exceeds those of Gukovo
Border Crossing Point. A daily average of 3,627 entries and exits was
recorded, which accounted for 24 percent of all entries/exits into the
Rostov Region.
The average number of people entering the
Russian Federation has diminished consistently during the reporting
period and the net flow has been negative since 29 August with a daily
average of minus 410.
As for the Gukovo Border Crossing Point,
this statistic clearly reflects a return movement into Ukraine. In the
past week close to 1,900 people have returned to Ukraine through the
Donetsk Border Crossing Point each day.
Throughout the week, shootings, blasts and
artillery detonations were heard at various times of the day and night,
and from different distances and directions around the Donetsk Border
Crossing Point. Artillery detonations were especially intense during the
weekend in the direction north of Krasnodon.
Throughout the night of 30 to 31 August,
dozens of very loud artillery detonations were heard and felt by an OT.
The detonations were close by in a westerly/ north-westerly direction.
In the past weeks, artillery detonations and
shootings had been heard only from western and northern directions; but
throughout the week for the first time OTs reported light and heavy
calibre shootings from the east and south-east areas which are also
bordering Ukraine.
Throughout the week, OTs observed a net
increase in activity of young people dressed in military style crossing
back and forth at the Border Crossing Point. OTs also observed some of
these people visibly wounded crossing back into the Russian Federation
with white bandages and/or crutches.
OTs also observed transfers of more
seriously-wounded persons by ambulances. Some people dressed in military
style were accompanying the wounded and were particularly well-equipped
including holsters but without weapons.
In one instance, an OT observed eight young
men dressed in military style carrying two heavy stretchers loaded with
boxes. The stretchers were visibly heavy (more than a hundred kilograms)
because the groups were stopping every 30 to 50 meters to recover. The
OT observed Border Crossing Point officials checking the boxes with
metal detectors.
The OT asked Border Crossing Point officials
about the content of the boxes and was told that it was food products.
Reports of people at the Donetsk Border Crossing
Point
OTs received reports from people of
Molodohvardeysk, Novosvetlovska (15 km south-east of Luhansk) and other
places around Luhansk city. They all indicated heavy fighting and
considerable damage to infrastructure and asked the OSCE to stop the
fighting.
Russian humanitarian convoy
The OM does not have any confirmation that a
second humanitarian convoy will go through the Donetsk Border Crossing
Point.
During the past week, representatives of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited the Donetsk
Border Crossing Point and met with Russian and Ukrainian border guards
and customs officers. To this day, Ukrainian border guards and customs
officers are still staying next to the Donetsk Border Crossing Point.
In addition, personnel of the Russian
Emergency Situations Ministry came to the Border Crossing Point to
consult with the Russian Border Crossing Point authorities.

Pack of Lies
At his speech in Estonia on September 3,
Obama states categorically:
And yet as we gather here today, we know
that this vision [of a Europe that is whole and free and at peace]
is threatened by
Russias aggression against Ukraine.
It
is a brazen assault on the territorial integrity of Ukraine,
a sovereign and independent European nation
This is whats at stake
in Ukraine. This is why we stand with the people of Ukraine
today.
NATO released new satellite images on
Thursday, 28 August 2014, that allegedly,
"show Russian combat forces engaged in
military operations inside the sovereign territory of Ukraine. The
images, captured in late August, depict Russian self-propelled
artillery units moving in a convoy through the Ukrainian countryside
and then preparing for action by establishing firing positions in
the area of Krasnodon, Ukraine..."
"Over the past two weeks we have noted a
significant escalation in both the level and sophistication of
Russias military interference in Ukraine," said Brigadier General
Tak.
"The satellite images released today
provide additional evidence that Russian combat soldiers, equipped
with sophisticated heavy weaponry, are operating inside Ukraines
sovereign territory."
(NATO,
Allied Command Operations, 28 August 2014)
While US-NATO is pushing for war with
Russia, the OSCE is overseeing the seven point peace plan
proposal to be discussed in Minsk on September 5.
