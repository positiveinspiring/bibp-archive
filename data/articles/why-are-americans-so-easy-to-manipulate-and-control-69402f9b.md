# Why Are Americans So Easy to Manipulate and Control?

The corporatization of society
requires a population that accepts control by authorities, and
so when psychologists and psychiatrists began providing
techniques that could control people,
the corporatocracy
embraced mental health professionals.
In psychologist B.F. Skinners
best-selling book Beyond
Freedom and Dignity (1971), he argued
that freedom and dignity are illusions that hinder the science
of behavior modification, which he claimed could create a
better-organized and happier society.
During the height of Skinners fame
in the 1970s, it was obvious to anti-authoritarians such as
Noam Chomsky (The
Case Against B.F. Skinner") and Lewis Mumord that
Skinners worldview - a society ruled by benevolent control
freaks - was antithetical to democracy.
In Skinners novel Walden Two (1948), his
behaviorist hero states,
We do not take history
seriously, to which Lewis Mumford retorted, And no wonder:
if man knew no history, the Skinners would govern the world,
as Skinner himself has modestly proposed in his behaviorist
utopia.
As a psychology student during that
era, I remember being embarrassed by the silence of most
psychologists about the political ramifications of Skinner and
behavior modification.
In the mid-1970s, as an intern on a
locked ward in a state psychiatric hospital, I first experienced
one of behavior modifications staple techniques, the token
economy. And thats where I also discovered that
anti-authoritarians try their best to resist behavior
modification.
George was a severely depressed
anti-authoritarian who refused to talk to staff, but for some
reason, chose me to shoot pool with. My boss, a clinical
psychologist, spotted my interaction with George, and told me
that I should give him a token - a cigarette - to reward his
prosocial behavior.
I fought it, trying to explain that
I was 20 and George was 50, and this would be humiliating. But
my boss subtly threatened to kick me off the ward. So, I asked
George what I should do.
George, fighting the zombifying
effects of his heavy medication, grinned and said,
We'll win. Let me have the
cigarette.
In full view of staff, George took
the cigarette and then placed it into the shirt pocket of
another patient, and then looked at the staff shaking his head
in contempt.
Unlike Skinner, George was not
beyond freedom and dignity.
Anti-authoritarians such as George -
who dont take seriously the rewards and punishments of
control-freak authorities - deprive authoritarian ideologies
such as behavior modification from total domination.
Behavior
Modification Techniques Excite Authoritarians
If you have taken introductory
psychology, you probably have heard of Ivan Pavlovs classical
conditioning and B.F. Skinner's operant conditioning.
An example of Pavlov's classical
conditioning? A dog hears a bell at the same time he receives
food; then the bell is sounded without the food and still
elicits a salivating dog. Pair a scantily clad attractive woman
with some crappy beer, and condition men to sexually salivate to
the sight of the crappy beer and buy it. The advertising
industry has been using classical conditioning for quite some
time.
Skinner's operant conditioning?
Rewards, like money, are positive reinforcements; the removal
of rewards are negative reinforcements; and punishments, such
as electric shocks, are labeled in fact as "punishments."
Operant conditioning pervades the
classroom, the workplace and mental health treatment.
Skinner was heavily influenced by
the book Behaviorism (1924) by John B. Watson.
Watson achieved some fame in the
early 1900s by advocating a mechanical, rigid, affectionless
manner in child rearing. He confidently asserted that he could
take any healthy infant, and given complete control of the
infants world, train him for any profession. When Watson was in
his early 40s, he quit university life and began a new career in
advertising at J. Walter Thompson.
Behaviorism and consumerism, two
ideologies that achieved tremendous power in the 20th century,
are cut from the same cloth.
The shopper, the student, the
worker, and the voter are all seen by consumerism and
behaviorism the same way: passive, conditionable objects.
Who are Easiest
to Manipulate?
Those who rise to power in the
corporatocracy are control freaks, addicted to the buzz of power
over other human beings, and so it is natural for such
authorities to have become excited by behavior modification.
Alfie Kohn,
in Punished by Rewards (1993), documents with copious research
how behavior modification works best on dependent, powerless,
infantilized, bored, and institutionalized people. And so for
authorities who get a buzz from controlling others, this creates
a terrifying incentive to construct a society that creates
dependent, powerless, infantilized, bored, and institutionalized
people.
Many of the most successful
applications of behavior modification have involved laboratory
animals, children, or institutionalized adults.
According to management theorists
Richard Hackman and Greg Oldham in Work Redesign (1980),
Individuals in each of these
groups are necessarily dependent on powerful others for many
of the things they most want and need, and their behavior
usually can be shaped with relative ease.
Similarly, researcher Paul Thorne
reports in the journal International Management (Fitting
Rewards, 1990) that in order to get people to behave in a
particular way, they must be,
needy enough so that rewards
reinforce the desired behavior.
It is also easiest to condition
people who dislike what they are doing.
Rewards work best for those who are
alienated from their work, according to researcher Morton
Deutsch (Distributive Justice, 1985). This helps explain why
attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-labeled kids
perform as well as so-called normals on boring schoolwork when
paid for it (see Thomas Armstrongs The Myth of the A.D.D.
Child, 1995).
Correlatively, Kohn offers research
showing that rewards are least effective when people are doing
something that isnt boring.
In a review of the literature on the
harmful effects of rewards, researcher Kenneth McGraw
concluded that rewards will have a detrimental effect on
performance under two conditions:
first, when the task is
interesting enough for the subjects that the offer of
incentives is a superfluous source of motivation; second,
when the solution to the task is open-ended enough that the
steps leading to a solution are not immediately obvious.
Kohn also reports that at least 10
studies show rewards work best on simplistic and predictable
tasks.
How about more demanding ones? In
research on preschoolers (working for toys), older children
(working for grades) and adults (working for money), all avoided
challenging tasks. The bigger the reward, the easier the task
that is chosen; while without rewards, human beings are more
likely to accept a challenge.
So, there is an insidious incentive
for control-freaks in society - be they psychologists, teachers,
advertisers, managers, or other authorities who use behavior
modification.
Specifically, for controllers to
experience the most control and gain a power buzz, their
subjects need to be infantilized, dependent, alienated, and
bored.
The
Anti-Democratic Nature of Behavior Modification
Behavior modification is
fundamentally a means of controlling people and thus for Kohn,
by its nature inimical to
democracy, critical questioning, and the free exchange of
ideas among equal participants.
For Skinner, all behavior is
externally controlled, and we dont truly have freedom and
choice.
Behaviorists see freedom, choice,
and intrinsic motivations as illusory, or what Skinner called
phantoms. Back in the 1970s, Noam Chomsky exposed Skinners
unscientific view of science, specifically Skinners view that
science should be prohibited from examining internal states and
intrinsic forces.
In democracy, citizens are free to
think for themselves and explore, and are motivated by very real
- not phantom - intrinsic forces, including curiosity and a
desire for justice, community, and solidarity.
What is also scary about
behaviorists is that their external controls can destroy
intrinsic forces of our humanity that are necessary for a
democratic society.
Researcher Mark Lepper was able to
diminish young childrens intrinsic joy of drawing with Magic
Markers by awarding them personalized certificates for coloring
with a Magic Marker.
Even a single, one-time reward for
doing something enjoyable can kill interest in it for weeks.
Behavior modification can also destroy our intrinsic desire for
compassion, which is necessary for a democratic society.
Kohn offers several studies showing,
children whose parents believe
in using rewards to motivate them are less cooperative and
generous [children] than their peers.
Children of mothers who relied on
tangible rewards were less likely than other children to care
and share at home.
How, in a democratic society, do
children become ethical and caring adults? They need a history
of being cared about, taken seriously, and respected, which they
can model and reciprocate.
Today, the mental health profession
has gone beyond behavioral technologies of control. It now
diagnoses noncompliant toddlers with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and
pediatric bipolar disorder and attempts
to
control them with heavily sedating drugs.
While
Big Pharma directly profits
from drug prescribing, the entire corporatocracy benefits from
the mental health professions legitimization of conditioning
and controlling.
