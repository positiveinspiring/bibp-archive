In the early 19th century, traders from Britain and America
bought porcelain, silk and tea from China.
Allegedly, the problem was the
traitors could find nothing to sell in exchange and the trade balance went
negative. China then built up substantial monetary reserves in silver.
In 1830, according to our accurate history books, the British finally
found something the Chinese would buy: Opium.
The fruit of the poppy was popular in many
countries but, as usual, the Chinese over-did it. First, it was a
favorite of the leisure classes, then, it trickled down to ordinary
workmen.
Soon, the coolies were neglecting their
labors and China was in crisis.
When the authorities tried to stop
the drug trade, the British opened
fire, humiliating the government and almost bankrupting it. People lost
confidence in Manchu rule.
By the mid-19th Century, nearly half
the country was in open revolt and saw the end of the oldest civilization in
written history and a culture that may have influenced the Sumerians,
Babylonians and the Persians.
The Chinese are responsible for the four
inventions that make life as we know it possible:
Is that Story
Possible?
Are we to believe that all of a sudden Hop Sing is addicted to a
psychotropic drug (more likely to get you constipated than high), moves to
America and becomes a stereotypical Chinese house servant for Ben Cartwright
at the Ponderosa?
Mike Jay in
Emperors Of Dreams, realizes the Opium
story is false information, which is deliberately intended to change the
dispositions and beliefs of a population:
The image at the core of this Opium belief
has rarely been examined, either at the time by contemporaries or more
recently by historians because a variety of interests intersect to
replicate it in different contexts.
In 1839, in spite of the so-called uncontrolled
demand for opiates, rather than coffee or cannabis, the British traders
found themselves with 20,000 chests of unsold opium on their store-ships,
just below Canton.
Then in one of those chance occurrences that
dont happen very often, like the same person winning the lottery three
weeks in a row, the Chinese had a tea party.
The British now had an excuse and the historians an explanation, for the
start of
the first Opium War.
The Plight of the
Chinese People
Lin Zixu, commissioner to the Emperor of China, allegedly sent a
letter to Queen Victoria appealing to the British sense of justice for the
plight of the Chinese people:
We have heard that in your own country
opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity: this is a
strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind.
[1]
The letter, which cannot be authenticated, was
allegedly written to invoke sympathy for the Chinese people hooked on Opium.
Samuel Wells Williams, noted diplomat and missionary to China, in
The Middle
Kingdom writes:
"The conflict was now fairly begun; its
issue between the parties so unequally matched - one having almost
nothing but the right on its side, the other assisted by every material
and physical advantage-could easily be foreseen" and again, after
speaking of it as being unjust and immoral, he concludes, "Great
Britain, the first Christian power, really waged this war against the
pagan monarch who had only endeavored to put down a vice harmful to his
people.
The tears are making it difficult to read
Narcotic Culture - A History of Drugs in China
by Frank Dikötter, Professor of the Modern History of China,
University of London.
Professor Dikötter believes the Opium Myth
is about prohibition:
An essential first step in demythologizing
the Chinese opium problem is to understand the [lack of] scientific
evidence about the drug's impact
upon the health of the individual
consumer' and as the historian of India Richard Newman writes: The China
field 'should be criticized for uncritically reproducing the anti-opium
stance adopted by prohibitionist missionaries in the late nineteenth
century.' [2]
It Was A Lie - The Question
Is Why?
The revolutions in Europe and American had ended. The world was about to
enter the Industrial Age.
The Global Financial Elite (TGFE, a
non-conspiracy acronym [3]) needed an excuse to invade the
country and overthrow the Manchu dynasty, just in case the rest of the world
decided to emulate China; like they almost did during the
McCarthy era.
[4]
Under the enlightened monarchies of the Manchu and Ming Dynasties, the
country thrived and worked together and was sustainable before it was in
to recycle and farm without pesticides.
What would our world look like today if the U.S. emulated the China in 1850?
Answer: The United Nations would not have written
the massive report, the GEO4, that says all
of humanity is at serious risk due to,
the dangers of climate change, water
scarcity, dwindling fish stocks and the pressures on the land and the
extinction of species.

[2] Newman shows that opium rarely undermined the health or shortened
the lives of the majority of smokers in nineteenth-century China. Others
have underlined that in England, where opium was widely available from
local shops during the nineteenth century, frequent and chronic users
did not suffer detrimental effects from opium: many enjoyed good health
well into their eighties. In South Asia a diversity of evidence offered
by both Indian and British physicians in the nineteenth century showed
that opium pills were commonly taken throughout the subcontinent without
creating serious social or physical damage, in contrast to the strong
spirits imported from abroad in the face of opposition from both the
Hindu and Muslim communities.

[4] 1949, according to the authors, was a pivotal year for McCarthyism
this system. Our irrational fear of communism and Castro never made
sense. McCarthyism is a term used to describe the making of accusations
of disloyalty, subversion, or treason without proper regard for
evidence. The term has its origins in the period in the United States
known as the Second Red Scare, lasting roughly from the late 1940s to
the late 1950s, coincides exactly with the period the communist
experiment in China was successful.
Mistakes? Consider the Communists First
Five-Year Plan
When Communism became the
ideology of the people in 1949, they fought pollution during the
successful First Five-Year Plan from 1953-57 and were moving towards
100% recycling until 1958 when the Great Leap Forward became the Great
Leap Famine and between 16.5 million and 40 million people died before
the experiment came to an end in 1961.
During the Five-Year Plan, Chinese articles and journals extolled the
benefits of recycling.
When a case of pollution arose, there
was scientific and collective action to undo the damage. The most
harmful industrial wastewater is that which contains phenol. If this
kind of poisonous industrial water is drained into a body of water
(such as a river, lake, or sea) before treatment, it will pollute
the water, kill the fish, and endanger the health of the people. And
if such poisonous waste water is drained into the farmland, it will
badly affect the normal growth of the crops.
The Mistakes explanation requires you
believe no one in China read or studied the industrialization of the
Western Countries.
Cost-benefit analyses in the U.S. show
that emission-reduction programs have provided much greater benefits
than their costs, by a ratio of up to 40 to 1. Air pollution damage
not only impacts the ecosystem but imposes major economic costs as
well as, from premature mortality, increased health care and lost
productivity and, more importantly, decreased crop yields.
