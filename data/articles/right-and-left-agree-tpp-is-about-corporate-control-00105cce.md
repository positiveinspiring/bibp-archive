# Right and Left Agree - TPP is About Corporate Control

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_tpp24.htm

There is not
another issue more emblematic and dastardly that furthers
the
New World Order agenda than total control over global trade.
The
Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) is so secret that the Pelosi rule
takes effect. You must approve it before you find out what is in
it.
So why is there so little outrage from the public about
negotiations that are fundamentally already approved in
a Bilderberg session? All factions of ideological persuasion that
oppose worldwide tyranny have a common interest and imminent
need to oppose the TPP.
Compare the
viewpoint from the genuine right with that of the honest left.
William F.
Jasper writes in the New American,
ObamaTrade "Fast Track" Still Alive Despite Senate Smack Down,
and has been in the forefront and consistent in denouncing the
Corporatocracy of the "Free Trade" hoax.
"The Trade
Promotion Authority (TPA) bill, as we have explained in more
detail in previous articles (see
here and
here), is essential for passage of the TPP and TTIP.
Virtually all of the pseudo-free trade agreements have depended
on the TPA/Fast Track process to rush the complex agreements
through Congress on an up-or-down, high-pressure vote, with very
little time to examine or debate the text, and with no
amendments or filibusters allowed.
The truly
bizarre element in the TPA battle is the fervor of the
Republican leadership in Congress demanding that their supposed
arch-enemy, President Barack Obama, be given TPA powers to ram
through, on the Fast Track, the secret
TPP/TTIP agreements that
he won't even allow members of Congress full access to.
With ObamaTrade, they would be handing him far more power than they
did with ObamaCare.
Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, the majority leader who has led this strange and
destructive effort, sounded like an Obama White House sock
puppet after the vote.
"This is not a game," McConnell said
after the vote. "This is about trying to accomplish something
important for the country that happens to be the president's No.
1 domestic priority."
For clarity,
watch the video
TPP Hands
the Keys to Corporate Foreign Powers where Mr. Jaspers makes
the case that the TPP is not really about trade agreements, but
is a formula for economic partnerships that supersede national
sovereignty.
Now compare
the sentiment from Julian Assange from the perspective of the
Wikileaks disclosures in a Democracy Now interview, entitled,
Julian Assange on the Trans-Pacific Partnership
- Secretive Deal
isn't About Trade, but Corporate Control.
"OK, so it's
a - the largest-ever international economic treaty that has ever
been negotiated, very considerably larger than NAFTA.
It is
mostly not about trade. Only five of the 29 chapters are about
traditional trade. The others are about regulating the Internet
and what Internet - Internet service providers have to collect
information.
They have to hand it over to companies under
certain circumstances. It's about regulating labor, what labor
conditions can be applied, regulating, whether you can favor
local industry, regulating the hospital healthcare system,
privatization of hospitals.
So, essentially, every aspect of the
modern economy, even banking services, are in the TPP.
And so, that
is erecting and embedding new, ultramodern neoliberal structure
in U.S. law and in the laws of the other countries that are
participating, and is putting it in a treaty form. And by
putting it in a treaty form, that means - with 14 countries
involved, means it's very, very hard to overturn.
So if there's
a desire, democratic desire, in the United States to go down a
different path - for example, to introduce more public
transport - then you can't easily change the TPP treaty, because
you have to go back and get agreement of the other nations
involved."
While the
emphasis may depart between the conservative and liberal
positions, both heartily agree that motivations behind the TPP
will drastically promote global consolidation under the guiding
hand of monopolists and authoritarians.
The ignorance in the American society
about international economics has always been known. What is
new-found in an era of induced survival depression is that the
productive producers and the social network recipients are so
docile in their tolerance for the adoption of total economic
tyranny.
Where are the WTO protectors performing
their street theater? Or where are the Tea Party activists
bombarding their Congressional representatives to forestall
another sellout?
The BATR RealPolitik Newsletter,
Dems Balk at Trade Deal featured a number of resources on
the Fast Track process. National surrender to international
governance is a betrayal of all that is worth preserving about
our country.
The fight to
reject the TPP is a core opportunity to forge an active populist
movement against the bipartisan tools who answer to their
corporatist masters.
True free
enterprise must be able to compete in a practical manner that
does not favor crony companies that are part of the NWO cartel
of elites.
Living in a
media bubble of disinformation requires that a serious national
movement against trade agreements that betray our people must be
combated with all our energy and commitment.
Approving the
TPP will demoralize our will to revitalize an independent and
viable domestic economy. The dismal record is clear that
previous global trade agreements simply transferred production
and wealth to foreign interests.
The barriers
between left and right false separations need to be broken down
in order to unite to defeat the corporatist plutocrats and
globalist fascists from imposing their vision for a neo-feudal
system that will reduce the rest of us to serfdom.
Maximum
pressure on Congress is the order of the day. Failure to launch
a grassroots campaign will result in the demise of America into
a third world cesspool. The argument is clear, inaction
guarantees perpetual poverty for your prodigy and grandchildren.
If you are not willing to fight destructive international trade
double-dealing, what exactly is the value of your existence?
American must become a serf free economy...
