In June of this year, at the Earth Summit in Rio
de Janeiro,
the United Nations (UN) will push for the expansion of their new
and improved
global environmental agency.
The UN Environmental Program (UNEP) will be promoted to specialized
agency with a new title, UN Environment Organization (UNEO).
The UNEO will prop up the Sustainable Development division of the UN. The
same agency that disseminates Agenda 21 policies to governments will be
centralized into a global agency with powerful international backing.
As the unscientific assertions of a global environmental crisis, vanishing
biodiversity and over-population become more urgent to the UN; the
insertion of international governance is being covertly added into the mix
as the answer to solve all problems worldwide.
Through treaties, agreements and institutions, reformation of the UN within
the UN has yielded quite a response.
Ban Ki-moon, UN Secretary General devised the global sustainability panel
that includes more than 50 supporters of the creation of UNEO.
One option is the possible transformation
of UNEP into a specialized agency of the United Nations.
A strengthened UNEP could enhance coherence
between relevant multilateral environmental agreements, and better
integrate its work with the activities of development institutions,
especially the United Nations Development Program, states one
recommendation.
The UN is changing the status of the program
to an agency to demand more funding for its initiatives; as well as
receives more power and autonomy.
Although UNEO is slated to be funded entirely by voluntary donation,
assessed contributions could be allocated to the agency on the basis of
success and necessity.
Specialized agencies within the UN receive these assessed contributions by
member states as derived from factors such as national income and gross
domestic product.
The more the country can afford, the more the UN takes to fund their
international directives.
One way of directing funds to the UN is through the usurpation of innovative
technologies for the sake of saving the planet. There is a call for
development and manufacturing of greenhouse safe products; however the
allocation of funding toward research for finding a way to mitigate or even
stop climate change effects seems to be left out.
The business of climate change is expected to be quite lucrative for those
successful at convincing authoritative bodies that these technologies must
be purchased by their nation and mandated for use by their citizens.
The UN will
disburse a global
carbon tax, redistribute the worlds wealth
and install programs that will place all issues concerning humanity,
poverty, the securitization of resources and education under its control and
command.
They will force ecological taxes to steer large amounts of money into funds
designed to redesign humanity, civilization and the planet - and fit them
all into their mold. A carbon cap-and-trade tax system for industrial
countries could yield $250 billion per year.
They also want to take in investment monies to mandate new public policies,
regulation and propose incentives,
by fundamentally restructuring public
spending and leveraging private investments towards environmental and
social investments, indebted industrial countries can expect to find new
growth paths that support fiscal consolidation while contributing to a
green economy.
The US contributed $22.9 million of American
taxpayer money to the UN in 2010. That accounted for 9.8% of the agencys
total annual funding.
US federal agencies that voluntarily gave to
the UN are:
The creation of a global environmental agency is
championed by the European Union, who has been calling for the upgrade of
UNEP for quite some time.
IN 2007, Jacques Chirac called for the expansion of a massive international
action to face the environmental crisis, referring to the yet realized UNEO.
We are coming to realize that the entire
planet is at risk, that the well-being, health, safety, and very
survival of humankind hangs in the balance.
We call for the transformation of the UNEP
into a genuine international organization to which all countries belong,
along the lines of the World Health Organization.
The ideal that Chirac lead over 5 years ago is
now being resurfaced and supported by 46 countries in the European Union; as
well as Africa, Latin America and Asia.
The US, Russia and China have declined to be part of the push for this
monstrous agency that will wield enormous international power over the
environment.
Chirac, a man-made climate change alarmist, backed the documentation of the
UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when they made public a
series of reports that claimed the global temperatures were exponentially
rising and those drastic effects would continue for centuries.
Obama has followed suit with the UN and created his own environmental
organization called the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). IRENA
is run like a UN agency, with members contributions based on the same
criteria as the UN funds their agencies.
IRENA receives American taxpayer money which
makes up 22% of its current annual budget.
