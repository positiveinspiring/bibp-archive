Psychopaths
we usually only know them from Hollywood movies.
We never
expect them to enter our real life. But, the psychopath is closer than you
think. Experts believe their number to be as high as one in a hundred. Most
of them function incognito in high-powered professions
all the way to the
very top.
But
it takes one to truly know one. In this intriguing documentary, Sam Vaknin, a
self-proclaimed psychopath, goes in search of a diagnosis. In a
scientific first, he allows himself to undergo testing to find out if he was
born without a conscience. He knows hes narcissistic and cannot empathize
with others.
By his own admission, hes pompous, grandiose, repulsive and
contradictory, ruthless and devoid of scruples, capricious and unfathomable
but he believes, hes not a bad person. What he is is indifferent
he
couldnt care less. Unless, of course, the topic is himself.
Vaknin and his long-suffering but ever-loyal wife, Lidija, embark on a
diagnostic road trip.
But, its uncharted territory
deep into the mind and
life of a psychopath. The 47-year-old convicted corporate criminal has
agreed to take part in the pursuit of his own diagnosis
meeting the worlds
experts in
psychopathy in the hope that science will provide some answers
for why he is like he is.
These experts put Vaknin (and his wife) through a
battery of rigorous psychological tests and neuro-scientific experiments.
Vaknin is shocked at the results.
Sam, his wife, the scientists, the
film-makers - will they ever be quite the same again?
