Control of Media
In his book, The Rockefeller File, free-lance journalist and bestselling
author Gary Allen declared,
"Rockefeller gang's plans for monopolistic
World Government are never, but never, discussed in the machines of mass
misinformation."
By now you probably already know why you haven't
heard of the Hidden Evil, or the coming socialist dictatorship in mainstream
news.
The people who are installing it control the
media.
"Why don't investigative news shows like
Sixty Minutes... tackle the... Trilateralist-CFR hold on our
government," asks Perloff. "Surely such material would have sufficient
audience appeal."
"The so-called founders of such giants as The New York Times and NBC
were chosen, financed and directed by Morgan, Schiff, and their allies,"
wrote Allen. Regarding the beginning of the takeover of the mainstream
news, Perloff says, "A prime mover in this process was J.P. Morgan - the
original force behind the CFR."
Perloff quotes Congressman Callaway's notation
in Congressional Record volume 54, dated February 9, 1917, which stated,
"In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan
interests... got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and
employed them to select the most influential newspapers... to control
generally the policy of the daily press of the United States."
The record continued,
"These 12 men... found it was only necessary
to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers... Emissaries were
sent to purchase the policy, national and international, of these
papers... [and] an editor was furnished for each paper to properly
supervise and edit information regarding... things of national and
international nature considered vital to the interest of the
purchasers... This policy also included the suppression of everything in
opposition to the wishes of the interests served."
"The CFR needs to reach the mass audience of Americans who do not belong
to, or attend the meetings of, or read material distributed by, the
propaganda organizations," declared Smoot. He continued, "[The] Council
on Foreign Relations leaders are aware of this need, and they have met
it."
Allen agreed, when he wrote,
"Public opinion is manufactured by the CFR's
ventriloquists in the mass media."
Former CFR member, Admiral Chester Ward,
described the CFR's influence in the mass media, too.
He proclaimed,
"They control or own major newspapers,
magazines, radio and television networks," and "the most powerful
companies in the book publishing business."
The Associated Press, New York Times, Washington
Post, and LA Times have their own wire services, which most mainstream news
outlets use. According to Allen, the CFR controls these wire services.
Ross observed,
"The CFR could not accomplish their goals
without complicity of the mainstream news media which they absolutely
control with an iron fist."
He explained that,
"Occasionally they will hold a public
meeting, and invite the open press (including C-SPAN), in order to give
the impression that they are a harmless group engaged only in social
activities."
Allen refers to the mainstream media as "CFR's
ventriloquists," and writes,
"At the center of Insider power, influence,
and planning in the United States is the pervasive Council on Foreign
Relations."
He adds,
"The CFR was created by the Rockefellers and
their allies to be the focus of their drive for a 'New World Order.'"
"We are grateful to The Washington Post, the New York Times, Time
Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our
meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty
years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the
world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those
years.
But, the world is now more sophisticated and
prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational
sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely
preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past
centuries."
-David Rockefeller, Bilderberg
Meeting, Baden-Baden Germany, 1991
Other outlets allegedly under the control of the
CFR include, the National Broadcasting Corporation, Columbia Broadcasting
System, Time, Fortune, Look, Newsweek, New York Post, Denver Post,
Louisville Courier Journal, Minneapolis Tribune, and the Knight Papers.
Publishing houses under CFR control include,
McGraw-Hill, Simon & Schuster, Harper Bros., Random House, Little Brown &
Co., Macmillan Co., Viking Press, Saturday Review, Business Week, and Book
of the Month Club.
The mainstream media appears to serve multiple functions. First, to
distribute information that the controlling cabal wants you to believe is
real news. Secondly, to assist in the cover-up of information that has
leaked out through other sources. In other words, Damage Control. T
hirdly, as a weapon to assassinate the
characters of those who expose the practices of the Establishment. Also, to
act as a firewall to prevent information detrimental to the elite's control
from reaching the public. Finally, to continue to reinforce mainstream
accounts of current and historical events.
The mainstream news essentially serves as a
primary tool for social conditioning or mind-control.
"It is through the press and the media that
the lie is penetrating through to the masses," declared Professor Marrs.
The media is used as a weapon. So when you
watch, read, or listen to mainstream news, ask yourself,
"what will the CFR like me to believe
today?" Allen sums up the real purpose of the mainstream news, stating,
"These are the Establishment's official landscape painters whose jobs it
is to make sure the public does not discover the C.F.R. and its role in
creating a world socialist dictatorship."
According to Allen, "psychology and propaganda"
used in the mainstream news, were,
"developed in the West in such places as the
Rockefeller financed Tavistock Institute in England."
He says,
"The hidden persuaders from Madison Avenue,
the Rand Corp. think tank or Hudson Institute, can and do manipulate
public opinion."
"The Establishment elitists," he explains
"refer to it as 'the engineering of consent.' That means we are made to
think the manacles they are slipping on our wrists are love bracelets."
Allen charges that the techniques developed at
these Think Tanks have been used successfully by Communist states.
"Think of the press as a great keyboard on
which the government can play."
-Dr. Joseph Goebbels, Nazi
Propaganda Minister
From the descriptions that these researchers
have given, an accurate analogy could be drawn from the Wizard of Oz.
America and other NATO are the great and powerful Oz, which appear to be run
by their respective leaders. The mainstream news is the "curtain," which
prevents us from understanding that the real controllers behind it are Think
Tanks, the Fed, Wall Street, and the Tax-exempt Complex.
Another role of the mainstream news is to project the illusion of a two
party system. The grass roots Democrats and Republicans have their
philosophical differences.
But, says Allen,
"as you move up the party ladders these
differences become less and less distinguishable until finally the
ladders disappear behind the Establishment's managed news curtain and
come together at the apex under the control of the C.F.R."
"There is no such thing at this date of the world's history, in America,
as an independent press. You know it and I know it... The business of
journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright... We are the tools
of rich men behind the scenes. We are jumping jacks, they pull the
strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are
all property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes."
-Journalist John Swinton, New York
Press Club 1953
Most people pay attention to the events
illuminated by these corporate-owned spotlights because they're big, common,
socially accepted, and because they're all most people have ever known. When
you start listening to independent news broadcasts, your conditioning begins
to come undone, you start to connect the dots and find that events that were
puzzling and seemed unrelated are part of the same picture. These
independent news outlets broadcast on shortwave, and web cast. Some have
past MP3 shows available for download. These shows are extremely
educational.(*)
By listening to these broadcasts you can become familiar with who really
runs this planet, what they've done, and where they're taking you. Most of
the topics discussed on these shows will never be covered on mainstream
news. If you do begin to listen to these shows, you may find yourself
watching mainstream news less frequently due to its high rubbish content.
You may also become temporarily upset after
realizing you've been deceived, you've been misled, conned, tricked - and
that most of your friends and relatives have too.
Control of History & Education
"According to some, history is basically a
jumble of events: blunders, coincidences, and happenstances that have
brought us to where we are today," wrote Perloff. "However, seen in the
context of globalist influence and maneuvering, history... begins to
make sense, as if snapping into place upon a calculated blueprint."
In 1915, Mr. Basil M. Manly, director of
research for a congressional investigation known as the Commission on
Industrial Relations, observed that control of information was being
extended by, the "endowment of colleges and universities, [and] through
controlling or influencing the public press," wrote Wormser. During the
Reece Committee hearings, Professor Kenneth Colegrove at Northwestern
University testified, "The officers of these foundations wield a staggering
sum of influence and direction upon research, education and propaganda in
the United States and even in foreign countries."
The Reece Committee concluded, "The impact of foundation money upon
education has been very heavy, largely tending to promote uniformity in
approach and method, tending to induce the educator to become an agent for
social change and a propagandist for the development of our society in the
direction of some form of collectivism. Foundations have supported text
books... which are destructive of our basic governmental and social
principles and highly critical of some of our cherished institutions."
Wormser exposed the profound influence that foundations have on public
education, when he stated, "Foundation giving most obviously has an enormous
impact on education, on social thinking, and ultimately on political action.
This influence reaches the public through the schools and academies, through
publicity, and through education and other associations dedicated to public
and international affairs." He sustained, "Foundation grants have become so
important a source of support that college and university presidents cannot
often afford to ignore the opinions and wishes of the executives who
distribute foundation largess."
Finally, he added, "This situation permits large foundations to exercise a
profound influence upon public opinion." Senator Goldwater agreed, writing,
"The intellectual influence of the academic community... is subservient to
the wealth of the great tax-free foundations."
Observing the effort by the Establishment to lie about history, former FBI
Agent Dan Smoot said, "The Reece Committee investigation threw some
revealing light on the historical blackout which the Council on Foreign
Relations has ordered and conducted." Smoot gave one example which included
a two-volume history of World War II, written in part by William L. Langer
of the CFR and funded by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
"Foundations have supported a conscious distortion of history," revealed the
Reece Committee. The phrase "conscious distortion" is a polite way of saying
blatant lie. "Twentieth-century history, as recorded in Establishment
textbooks and journals, is inaccurate," stated Professor Sutton. "The
prevailing Establishment version is seen to be, not only inaccurate, but
designed to hide a pervasive fabric of deceit and immoral conduct."
Professor Sutton explained that they are effective, "Not so much because of
outright censorship, although that is an important element, but more because
of the gullibility of the American 'educated public.'"
Professor Marrs concludes that these historical lies are deliberately
manufactured so the public will be easier to control. He charges, "The
rewriting and deceitful misinterpretation of American and world history is
one of the main methods used to manipulate and shape public opinion." "The
establishment of the American Historical Society was no doubt an
unprecedented step in instituting this diabolical plan to rewrite the past,"
he observes.
The accrediting agencies themselves may also be controlled by the Tax-exempt
Foundations, as suggested by the Reece Committee. It stated that the
"so-called "accrediting' organizations... are extra-governmental, yet...
[influence] education to a considerable degree. For various reasons
colleges, universities, and specialized schools and departments today
require 'accreditation,' that is, approval of one or more of these
organizations which presume to set standards. Some of these accrediting
organizations are supported by foundations..."
"Universities, hospitals, institutes and learned societies sometimes supply
nothing but their name labels affixed to what is actually a pet project of
foundation managers," announced Wormser. According to Wormser, they pick the
professors, they pick the topics, and they even pick the research staff. And
they already know what the outcome is going to be. These doctors,
professors, research staff, etc. are made well aware in advance that there
will be a particular conclusion that they must arrive at. Not adhering to
this predetermined conclusion will result in a denial of grants.
Professor Sutton agreed, writing, "Through foundations controlled by this
elite, research by compliant and spineless academics, 'conservatives' as
well as 'liberals' has been directed into channels useful for the objectives
of the elite essentially to maintain this subversive and unconstitutional
power apparatus. Through publishing houses controlled by this same financial
elite unwelcome books have been squashed and useful books promoted."
"It is understandable," continued the professor, "that universities and
research organizations, dependent on financial aid from foundations that are
controlled by this same New York financial elite, would hardly want to
support and to publish research on these aspects of [authentic]
international politics." Books critical of the official account of history
don't get reviewed or are not available through mainstream outlets. And
according to author Perloff, historians that do not adhere to their version
of history are often blacklisted.
Smoot asks, "Where will you find a college administration that will not
defend the Ford Foundation against all critics - if the college has just
received, or is in line to receive, a million-dollar gift from the
Foundation? How far must you search to find college professors or school
teachers who will not defend the Foundation which gives 25 million dollars
at one time, to raise the salaries of professors or school teachers?"
In a future chapter called, The Satanic Influence, we'll find evidence that
the AHA was setup by an Establishment organization known as The Order of
Skull and Bones. This organization, like its elite Think Tank counterparts,
works toward the objective of a one-world socialist dictatorship under elite
control. The mainstream media is used as a weapon by these groups.
Allen, observed that the Rockefellers "do not pour money into local school
board races; they put their bucks into the schools that train the teachers
and they finance the writing of textbooks." He stated, "The family couldn't
care less who controls the local school board." According to Allen, the
publishing houses under CFR control also specialize in publishing school
textbooks.
Speaking of the movement by the Council on Foreign Relations to use
professors in their deliberate campaign to rewrite the past, author Perloff
noted, "The council's [CFR's] steering committee moved to distinguish the
roster by adding college professors... They hailed from campuses beholden to
J.P. Morgan. As Dr. Quigley observed: 'The Wall Street contacts with these
professors were created originally from Morgan's influence in handling large
academic endowments.'"
This evidence suggests that mainstream schools and media are conduits for
historical lies. It also suggests that they are a medium for social
conditioning, also known as mind-control. Professor Sutton observed, "The
existing system of education is little more than a conditioning mechanism.
It has little to do with education in the true sense, and a lot to do with
control of the individual. This requires suppression of individualist
tenancies and a careful spoon-feeding of approved knowledge."
Professor Marrs declared, "Few of us are aware that such techniques are
being utilized against us since we're constantly being led to believe...
that we are independent, resourceful, intelligent, and fully able to make up
our own minds." Many of us have operated most of our lives on a filtered
version of history. Or, in essence, lies.(**)
Summary
So, according to the results of congressional investigations and independent
researchers, mainstream history is written by the financial elite. The CFR
and interlocking Think Tanks have literally rewritten history using schools
and publishing houses which they control by grants from their private
multi-billion-dollar bank accounts (Tax-exempt Foundations).
I'm not an expert on history, but the information I'll be presenting in
future chapters will be more accurate than some mainstream accounts. Now
that you understand that a financial elite does exist and that they exercise
an enormous amount of control over mainstream publications, it will be
easier to understand why the following events did not unfold as presented in
schools and mainstream media. Although some of this information pertains
directly to the U.S., it is relevant to all NATO countries, because as goes
America, so goes the rest of the world.
