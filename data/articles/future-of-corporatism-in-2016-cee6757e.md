Economists,
stock pickers and financial analysts are eager to play the
forecast game.
Clients of these erudite soothsayers would like
you to believe that their study of trends and markets are
founded on empirical maxims. What they carefully avoid admitting
is that predicting the political climate is even more important
than knowing the direction that monitory central banking will
follow. 2016 promises to be a pivotal year.
Depend upon the
overactive drive of a lame duck President to complete his task
of ruining the economy before he leaves office.
Add into this
environment, the distractions from party campaigns that will
gravitate towards non economic issues as much as possible, in
face of factions pushing foreign policy fears to the top of the
agenda.
Terror at home will become the mainstay of
the mass
media.
Why? The easy answer is that the continued deterioration
in our standard of living could rally and become the central
concern in the next election.
Corporatism
will benefit that the spotlight will shine away from their
consolidation and advancement in their monopolistic
organization. In order to know what to expect, look to the
success or failure of the "Free Trade" agreements that are
moving forward and gaining ground for the globalist.
TPP
and
TTIP if approved and implemented will seal the doom on any
domestic prosperity.
Even in the EU, opposition to the TTIP is
growing.
"Caving
into Corporatism - Endgame for Secret 'Trade' Pact
Negotiations" states:
"The
submission of governments to corporate interests is hardly a new
phenomenon, but it is accelerating - particularly in Brussels,
now home to almost as many lobbying groups as DC.
Meanwhile, at
Europe's local level, opposition to TTIP continues to grow, and
with good reason: while some parts of some countries might
benefit handsomely, others stand to lose out enormously,
resulting in widening economic imbalances across Europe's
regions."
Remember, the European populace has never been
able to block the dictates of the EU, especially on trade
issues.
The
Corporatist will strengthen their strangle hold on international
trade, which has become a function of favored political subsidy,
more than competitive efficiency and superior product
performance.
This
relationship in transnational mercantilism does not enrich the
population of producing countries or the consumers of imported
goods, but does supercharge global conglomerates that operate
under the special treatment from
New World Order governments.
Thomas E.
Woods Jr., makes the following argument and writes in, 'The Cultural Costs of Corporatism
- How Government-Business
Collusion Denigrates the Entrepreneur and Rewards the Sycophant'.
"Through
corporatism, ironically, government creates an economy that
looks just like the socialist's caricature of capitalism.
The
big get bigger while the small guys are frozen out. People with
money make sure to buy off the powerful. It is a zero-sum game,
and the game is rigged, with the rules constantly changing. And
the incentives are all bad.
In a free
market, commerce fosters virtue. A free economic exchange
involves two parties voluntarily trading for their mutual
benefit. Commerce doesn't simply enrich a society; it also
fosters community and trust. Diligence, reliability,
friendliness, and honesty are all rewarded in the long run in a
free market.
Under corporatism, commerce
erodes virtue. Sycophancy is rewarded instead of insight.
Cleverness is more valuable than innovation. Businessmen get
the message: stay small, or be prepared to play ball with
politicians.
Everyone becomes a welfare
recipient or sharecropper for government or big business."
The
conditions that create this unbalanced playing field are not
likely to change for the better.
What has a high probability is
that the deflationary impact of a continuing retraction in
world-wide activity will accelerate. Couple this with a
pronounced slowing in the velocity of money, trade will decline.
Many economic gurus are warning of
a major
financial collapse in 2016. However, the balance sheets of
companies have not accrued such high reserves in living memory.
Low interest rates are still available, so as reported in,
Business
Mergers Soar in 2015, should maintain their pace in this
coming year.
The clearest
expectation is that unemployment will spike. Global unrest and
the flood of migration into the EU cannot boost their economies.
China is a shell of their engine of growth and Japan is still
trying to keep their head above water.
Where will economic
expansion come from?
The prospect
of war looks like the segment that has all factors pointing in
their direction. Many Corporatists gravitate into becoming
munitions industrialists. Governments always seem to make money
available when global depressions are on the horizon.
So look for
international tensions to translate into corporate contracts. In
a world economy based upon a diminished need for labor, the
inevitable contraction in consumer spending follows.
As
government's schemes amplify to maintain a minimum social
network, companies will vie to become even more effective
lobbyists. When escalation expenditures place additional demands
on state budgets, the pressure to sell off public assets to
crony companies will intensify.
Corporatism
will streamline and become more far reaching at the same time.
Reducing bureaucracy while increasing areas of profit centers
will become the new corporate culture.
The demands to step up
their power grab can be gauged in their multiplicity to organize
even bigger cartels.
Alliances,
partnerships and joint ventures will become more common as the
appearance of competition is discarded. A new definition of
insider trading will emerge, which places a public relations
spin that companies can collude for the betterment of the
economy.
The natural
backlash that comes when the struggling middle class continues
to be devastated has less relevance as responsive electoral
support for the political class diminishes.
2016 will prove to
even the most establishment cheerleader and supporter, that the
economy is locked into a downward spiral.
"Make America
Great Again" will not be fostered in corporate board rooms. Only
an alternative Main Street marketplace based upon a merchant
economy of small businesses can offer hope to a plummeting
society.
Domestic independence is the key to restoring a
prosperous future.
