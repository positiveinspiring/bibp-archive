As usual, we swim in a pile of
dishonorable politicians. An Arab poem describes how the rotten
rubbish floats to the top of the water while all the gems - corals
and precious fish - stay at the bottom.
(An Arab friend)
If events of the past few days are anything to
go by, the UN-NATO insurgent allies are set to bring a grim, lawless,
murderous and fundamentalist future to the New Libya.
Polygamy is set to return as the disenfranchisement of women, the Wests new
friend and interim leader, Mr Jalil has declared. (He didnt put it
quite like that, but the particular interpretation of Sharia Law he
espouses, does.)
A country which had health, education and welfare services of which most
could only dream (i) is also set to instantly revert fifty years.
Flying King Idris flag, Libya is being plunged seamlessly back to
his era of illiteracy and neglect.
It will not get better. Britain is already demanding that bombarded,
bereaved, largely broken Libya, pay compensation for its liberation. No,
not satire. (ii)
Libya also has its very own Falluja, in the fled, dead and now destroyed
city of Sirte, flooded, ruined and heart rending. It also has its own Basra
Roads. See the melted, bombed vehicles leaving Sirte and across Libya.
Those inside them also melted or vaporized, a
mirror image of that 1991 US massacre of the fleeing in Iraq...
Soon Libya will also have its own living memorials to their release from
free healthcare, gasoline too cheap to meter and the highest living standard
in Africa: deformed babies from the radioactive and chemically toxic
depleted uranium weapons which rained down
on them.
Another mirror image of Iraq, Afghanistan and
the Balkans where these weapons were also used.
The events though, of the last days, have shone a light on the grim reality
of the future for the population. The shocking spectacle of Colonel Kaddafi
and his sons bodies, displayed to the public, in a meat cooler in a mall,
until decomposition forced a furtive, body snatch and night time burial in
an undisclosed location, hardly bodes well for the human rights to come.
Neither does the breaking of the commitment to return the bodies to the
remaining, so far, un-murdered family. (iii)
Their corpses should be dumped in the
desert to be eaten by foxes, stated one liberator, claiming that at
the deaths we all took turns to stamp on the former Leaders face,
some hitting it with shoes.
When Aisha Kaddafi called her father,
minutes after his death, reports state that one of the thugs answered the
call telling her:
Fuzzy head is dead.
Aisha lost her husband and baby in a NATO
bombing in July.
She is an internationally respected lawyer,
whose cases have included being part of Saddam Husseins defence team and
who also defended Muntader Al Saidi, the journalist who threw his
shoes at
George W. Bush in Baghdad, for:
the widows, the orphans...,
...the former President had created in Iraq, on
his declared Crusade.
She is also a former Good Will Ambassador for
the
United Nations.
One can only speculate how much good will she
feels towards a UN which has endorsed the murder and plunder of family,
people and land, now. She had lost her father, four brothers, her baby
daughter, with her two little cousins, within little over three months.
One (of many) questions which should be answered over the shoddy,
surreptitious disposal of the bodies of Libyas rightful leader, his son and
his Defence Minister, Abu Bakr Younis, is,
-
If the stated reason is because the
insurgents did not want his last resting place to become a shrine,
was he really the monster
Washington and Whitehall have trumpeted?
-
Or did the coalition just have an eye
on the resources he stubbornly kept, largely for the benefit of his
people?
Americas Nobel "Peace" Prize Laureate
first
black President, has declared the death of Muammar Kaddafi:
A momentous day in the history of Libya.
This, as rebel forces going by the name of The
Brigade for Purging Slaves (of) Black Skin have reportedly detained and
displaced hundreds, while the people of Tawergha, a town of 20,000, have
disappeared without a trace.
Numerous reports record that there are those avowed to ethnically cleanse
Libya of dark and black skins. There are two million black Libyans,
nearly one third of the population of little over six million.
Moreover, for all the horrific rhetoric over the deaths on 20th
October, there are serious questions as to who really carried them out.
Our armed forces have been in action, said
Prime Minister Cameron. (Yes, the same Cameron who said there will never
be British boots on the ground
)
Further:
British Special Forces are engaged in a
frantic desert manhunt for Colonel Kaddafi's son Saif... (iv)
Heaven forbid that this sophisticated man
should survive to tell the stories of socializing with,
-
Tony Blair
-
Lord Peter Mendelson
-
Prince Andrew
Or of Blairs alleged six visits to his father,
twice courtesy the hospitality of Colonel Kaddafi's private plane.'
Kaddafi, in the flowery language which is Arabic, had called the insurgents
rats, as Saddam Hussein had referred to them as carion and crows. So
the Colonel is found in a sewer pipe. Get the connection? Few with a
functioning brain would not wonder if this sewer rat image was not thought
up by intelligence in Washington or Whitehall.
As the great democracies plunder and assassinate, do cast a passing
thought to the (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights (v)
which celebrated its sixtieth anniversary on 10th December
2008, with great fan-fare.
Article 10: Everyone is entitled in full
equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial
tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any
criminal charge against him.
Article 3: Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of
person.
Article 5: No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment.
Sabah Al Mukhtar, President of the London
based Arab Lawyers Association, is incandescent.
The US, UN, France and the UK should be
seriously concerned regarding what has befallen Kaddafi. The serious
legal implications of a killing with no trial, after an eight month
bombardment. We have treated the law with contempt - and trampled on it
for two decades.
That the murderers are to investigate the
murders renders Orwell redundant.
So far, of course, it seems we only have the perpetrators word that there
was even a burial, somewhere near the port city of Misrata, disgraceful as
it was. Perhaps,
as with bin Laden, a precedent was set and
the victims were simply fed to the fishes.
Erase the evidence? The burials - or disposals -
were on two less than auspicious anniversaries. The British military
disaster which was the Charge of the Light Brigade, in 1854, and the more
recent, cravenly cowardly invasion of the tiny island of Grenada in 1983.
As ever, ignorance rules.
After the disasters of Afghanistan and Iraq,
with tope military brass now admitting that they had no idea of the
complexity of the societies, (US) Colonel Cedric Leighton writes that
in spite of the celebrations in Libya:
it is easy to think our job in the
Middle East is over.
Buy a map, Colonel. Wrong continent. (vi)
