Much
of "Science Fiction" is not Fiction
This Awareness indicates there are
many entities in the Immortal Realms, these being of all types, there are
many planets in the Mortal Realms, there are many more in the Immortal Realms--these
entities are often capable of moving between realms and through space from
planet to planet, and many of these are of very unusual nature, much as have
been indicated in your science-fiction movies and stories, and many of these
have great powers and also have strange ideas.
This Awareness indicates this particular
planet has been heavily influenced by such a one -- the entity Jehovah, and
as having been influenced also by Luciferians and those who were associated.
This Awareness indicates there was a time when the Natas or Satanists and
the Luciferians worked together, but these entities since that time have separated
as there has grown a mistrust between these entities. This Awareness indicates
that there has been a closer tie between the Luciferians and the Jehovahites,
but this is also changing. This Awareness indicates that in this particular
case, both the Luciferians and the Jehovahites, or those who are followers of
Jehovah, these are in process of transmuting
and merging back toward the Galactic Confederation, associated with those
who are
the Galactic Confederation often referred as the Serpent People, due
to the symbol used on their ships.
This Awareness indicates that essentially
the Luciferians and the Jehovahites as now becoming more humane and less competitive
in their behavior - these entities beginning to learn the meaning of the power
of Love, for they have experienced repercussions in their efforts to gain
control over lives and energies of others. This Awareness indicates that this
is largely due to the intense battle of consciousness which has been raging
upon this Earth between the Wanderers, the Luciferians, the Satanists, and
the Jehovahites for thousands of years.
This Awareness indicates that the
Universe is not as most entities have been taught to believe, that the Universe
is filled with inhabitants not too unlike entities upon the earth. This Awareness
indicates that these entities have been to and from the Earth many times.
That there have been civilizations upon this Earth which have been highly
advanced, with spiritual development that super-exceeds anything presently
known. This Awareness indicates that this Earth has been watched and has been
visited by many entities from other systems and from other planes.
Parting
of the Red Sea and other Miracles were the work of UFO's
This Awareness indicates that the
gods and the lords of old are not mythical characters, nor are these entities
supernatural, though they are supernormal, and in many instances superhuman.
This Awareness indicates that these entities also have a super technology
and often a superconsciousness. This Awareness indicates that many miracles
of the Old Testament are recordings of the spaceships which were piloted
by the group of space travelers known as Jehovah. This Awareness indicates
that these entities protected their chosen tribes with their technology, their
spaceships, which had the capacity, the capabilities of effecting what in
those times would be considered as "miracles".
This Awareness indicates that the
parting of the Sea occurred from energies of a particular type of spacecraft
which repelled the waters to allow the followers to pass through, but then
closed against the Egyptians. This Awareness suggests that entities in reading
the Old Testament stories, may, in their imaging, find that when they
substitute the word Lord, or Jehovah, wherein this word can
be read with the an image of a spaceship, there will be much clarification
of meaning. This Awareness indicates that such statements regarding entities
not touching the Lord as the Lord comes down upon the mountain -- that
any entity who comes close or touches will surely die -- that this in relation
to the radioactive energies and the high vibratory energies of the spaceship.
This Awareness indicates that often
the pilot or commander, or the lord of the spaceship, was confused
with the spaceship itself by the writers. That at times they speak of the
Commander, or Lord, walking with a particular person, and at
other times their Lord is flying above, creating thunderbolts, earthquakes,
fires or other disturbances of a magnificent and terrible nature. This Awareness
indicates that in both cases the term "Lord " may be used,
but the reference may be interchangeable between the meaning of the personality
or the spacecraft. This Awareness indicates this does not in any way detract
from the concept of the Universal God, but this does indicate a difference
between a personality God and an Universal God.
This Awareness indicates the entity
Jehovah as being an Immortal being; yet this entity as not the creator of
the Universe, but one who was capable of creating through the use of certain
cosmic and universal principles, creating forms. This Awareness indicates
your present scientists are reaching a level whereby they also may soon become
capable of creating that which you call clones.
Cloning
This Awareness indicates the entity
Jehovah essentially was creating the Adam and Eve (Hebrews), being
created in the image of Jehovah, as likened unto that which is related unto
cloning, whereby the cell of an entity is taken and the nucleus of that cell
is placed within the egg of a female, whereas the nucleus of that egg is removed.
This then, is implanted in an incubation system to allow the clone to develop,
and that development will be in the exact image of the entity from which the
cell was taken. This Awareness indicates this has been done upon your plane
by others than your own scientific establishment whereby entities have been
cloned and created.
This Awareness indicates that the
entity Jehovah, creating his special followers for tending his garden and
for personal experiments, this entity then proceeded to attempt to mold and
create and direct those clones by using the motivational behavior system of
punishment and reward. This Awareness indicates that the entire Western civilization
as being reflections of that kind of consciousness. This Awareness indicates
that the present spiritual organizations who stress the fear and punishment,
particularly wherein the punishment is that from an unknown cause, or what
may be termed unknown fears: fears created by concepts which may or may not
be valid, such as the annihilation of the soul -- that such concepts and such
fear producing ideas being used against entities to keep them in line, to
force them into certain levels of obedience -- this is but an old way which
has been used for eons of time to keep entities enslaved and ignorant.
This Awareness suggests that if an
entity teaching this can give the clear source for his information, can show
entities how they may discover this for themselves, and can assist entities
in finding ways whereby the behavior of an entity is encouraged rather than
enforced -- this Awareness suggests that then the teacher is showing responsibility
rather than mere reckless control over his or her followers.
