The election of Barack Obama to the U.S. Presidency sparked global
celebrations among political progressives. While
critics at the extreme end of the
progressive community were alarmed by his election,
most political progressives are fervently
hoping that Obama can turn the U.S. around after eight disastrous years
under the Bush administration.
While
critics of President-Elect Obama suspect
him and his supporters of creating a personality cult that will be used to
promote big corporate interests they overlook the extent to which Obama
reflects a powerful archetypal force in the U.S. collective consciousness.
The archetype is "The Hero" as represented in Joseph Campbell's
popular book,
The Hero with a Thousand Faces
(1949).
Campbell described the Hero as an archetypal
figure that goes through a journey of self-discovery by first separating
from society, then being initiated into sacred mysteries, and finally
returning to society. With the return, the Hero provides the fruits of his
or her labor where many positive ethical changes are made to uplift society.
In 1999/2000, I wrote,
The Hero's Journey to a Second American Century
(published 2001) where Joseph Campbell's 'hero journey' was applied to
nation-states. An extra ethical phase was identified that created a complete
cycle - the Forgetting. So a nation-state could go through repeated cycles
of a national hero's journey over centuries of history: Separation,
Initiation, Return and Forgetting.
The idea that the policies of nations could
follow distinct cycles was first proposed by the historian Arthur
Schlesinger, Snr., in a 1939 essay, "The Tides of American Politics" (Yale Review).
The idea was further developed by his son, Arthur Schlesinger, Jnr.,
in
The Cycles of American History (1986)
where he identified moral cycles in America's foreign and domestic policies.
The different stages used in The Hero's Journey to a Second American Century
were,
-
first, the 'Call to Adventure' where a
nation would separate itself from a corrupted international system
-
second, the 'Great Remembering,' was
where the nation returned to its founding ideals and integrated
these into a new national mission
-
third, the 'Return to International
Society,' where the nation would embark again to support its ideals
on the international stage
-
final stage, the 'Deep Forgetting',
represented a nation entering into a period of forgetting its
national ideals in pursuit of imperialism and national greed
An article summarizing America's different hero
journeys is available
here.
At the beginning of the
Bush administration, the U.S. was poised to enter a
'Deep Forgetting' wherein the ideals of the Founding fathers would be
forgotten. This has been proved to be the case over the eight years of
President Bush's tenure. The 2008 election of Barack Obama in turn promises
to usher in a new cycle of the Hero's journey for the U.S., its eighth,
where the U.S. enters into a deeper and more meaningful expression the
ideals of the Founding Fathers.
But before examining Obama's role in this new
Hero's journey for the U.S., it's important to pause and reflect on what
occurred during the Bush administration.
911, Contrived Wars,
Drugs and the Deep Forgetting
The attacks on
September 11, 2001, galvanized American public support for a
set of military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq that were claimed by
the Bush administration to be a necessary part of a global
war on terror.
The 911 Commission Report came up with many recommendations for the Bush
Administration, some of which were never implemented.
Of most concern to critics, were the omissions
of The 911 Report when it came to foreknowledge of a possible terrorist
attempt to hijack planes, civil and military exercises on 911, and the
collapse of World Trade Center 7. This led to a growing number of critics
suspecting the senior members of the Bush administration were complicit in
the 911 attacks.
Authors such as David Ray Griffin,
The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions about 911
and the Bush Administration, went as far as contending that
the 911 attacks were part of a
False Flag operation.
Other authors such as Michael Rupert in
Crossing The Rubicon provided
persuasive evidence that the civil and military exercises occurring on the
morning of 911, simulated hijacked aircraft hitting buildings including the
World Trade center. Vice President Cheney was in charge of these
exercises as mandated by a May 21, 2001
Presidential Statement and directly played
a role in preventing NORAD intercepting hijacked planes.
The exercises directly refuted Bush
administration claims that it had no foreknowledge of terrorist attacks
involving hijacked planes, and made senior officials a direct part of events
on the morning of 911.
A growing number of Americans have concluded 911 was a False Flag operation
to deceive the public to support a series of wars that are part of a
contrived global "war on terror". The Democratic Party to date has not
satisfactorily addressed omissions in
The 911 Commission Report, or the
contrived intelligence data that led to military interventions in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
The
Articles of Impeachment submitted in April 2007
by Congressman Dennis Kucinich to the U.S. House of Representatives
on the basis of a contrived intelligence data to support the Iraq War was
not supported by the Democratic leadership. There has subsequently been much
evidence emerging into the public realm to confirm that the Bush
administration committed international war crimes in Iraq and elsewhere.
Furthermore, there is growing suspicion that the war in Afghanistan provided
a cover for the
CIA's involvement in the drugs trade aimed
at generating revenues for undisclosed purposes. Deceased journalist,
Gary Webb, wrote
The Dark Alliance, a persuasive series
of articles in 1996 and a book in 1998 detailing the CIA's involvement in
the drug trade.
Revenue from drug trade and other illicit
operations are directed towards a secret 'unofficial'
CIA black budget that runs over a trillion
dollars annually.
In contrast to the CIA's more limited "official" black
budget generated from appropriations from the Department of Defense, the
"unofficial" black budget has been used to fund a highly classified set of
projects called the Second Manhattan Project whose true purpose is yet to be
disclosed to the American public.
-
Investigations into claims that 911 was an inside job
-
Intelligence data was
manipulated to justify war against Iraq
-
CIA is complicit in the drug
trade in Afghanistan and elsewhere,
...have been stopped on the grounds of
national security.
Over the course of the
Bush administration there was little government transparency and
accountability in key institutions of American power, that were unresponsive
to Freedom of Information requests from the general public.
The Bush administration eventually became the
most secretive Presidential administration on record.
Obama, Podesta and
Commitment to Open Government
The 2008 election of Barack Obama promises to change the secrecy on
national security grounds that made possible the excesses of the Bush
administration. Obama's first significant political appointment after his
election was that of John Podesta to head his transition team.
Podesta provides an important clue into the policy orientation of the
incoming Obama administration - Commitment to Open Government.
Podesta was a major player in the passage of President Bill Clinton's
Executive Order 12958 on April 17 1995.
EO 12958 prescribed "a uniform
system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security
information" that would reflect a greater "commitment to open Government".
EO 12958 was viewed as an essential tool in
ensuring the release of many national security files that had been
unnecessarily classified for decades. After the passage of EO 12958, Podesta
served on the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy,
chaired by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY).
In its 1997 report
the Commission observed:
"The best way to ensure that secrecy is
respected, and that the most important secrets remain secret, is for
secrecy to be returned to its limited but necessary role. Secrets can be
protected more effectively if secrecy is reduced overall."
After passage of EO 12958 and the Secrecy
Commission Report, Podesta become President Clinton's Chief of Staff from
1998 to 2001.
Podesta's support for declassification of national security files even
extended to
UFOs. On October 22, 2002, Podesta made a statement at the
National Press Club concerning the legality of UFO information that has not
been released to the public on national security grounds.
He said:
"I think it's time to open the books on
questions that have remained in the dark on the question of government
investigations of UFOs. It's time to find out what the truth really is
that's out there.
We ought to do it because it's right, we ought to do
it because the American people, quite frankly, can handle the truth and
we ought to do it because it's the law."
Clinton White House Chief of staff John Podesta on
UFOs
In 2003, Podesta created the Center for American
Progress, where he continued his advocacy of transparency and government
openness.
He became a critic of the passage of
Executive Order 13292 by
President Bush in March 2003 that facilitated greater government secrecy
when it came to national security records. It significantly weakened key
provisions from Clinton's EO 12958 or removed them altogether.
An example was the removal of the following
critical clause:
"If there is significant doubt about the
need to classify information, it shall not be classified".
In September 2008, Podesta wrote a paper where
he outlined his key recommendations to the next President:
The next president should rewrite Executive
Order 13292 to reinstate the provisions of Executive Order 12958 that
establish a presumption against classification in cases of significant
doubt, permit senior agency officials to exercise discretion to
declassify information in exceptional cases where the need to protect
the information is outweighed by the public interest in disclosure, and
prohibit reclassification of material that had been declassified and
released to the public under proper authority.
Podesta's appointment to head Obama's transition
team, signals an important focus for the new Obama administration - greater
declassification of national security records and a commitment to Open
Government.
Obama and Restarting
America's Hero's Journey
Obama's charismatic appeal and inspiration to many in the U.S. and the globe
makes him the ideal candidate to restart America's Hero's journey on the
platform of a commitment to Open Government.
That would represent the "Call to Adventure" for
a new Hero's journey, as described in my The Hero's Journey in the Second
American Century. To do so, Obama needs to demonstrate a clear commitment
to
end the Bush administration's covert and imperial policies. The diverse
interest groups that sanctioned these policies in whole or in part must also
be resisted and exposed.
This will be the greatest challenge confronting
Obama who out of political necessity had to appoint many to powerful
political office with ties to major corporations.
Over the course of his upcoming administration, Obama will need to exert a
major hands-on role to ensure that his appointees don't simply promote a
more publicly palatable set of corporate interests. A commitment to Open
Government requires releasing to the public previously classified national
security information that will reveal much about the inner working of
government.
This will make it possible for greater
accountability of public officials to be exercised.
This will be vitally
important in dealing with excesses of the Bush administration, especially
when it comes to deficiencies in,
-
the 911 Commission Report
-
the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq
-
the CIA's complicity in the drug trade
President-Elect Obama needs to set the U.S. on a new
Hero's journey, it's
eighth, where the U.S. restores public trust in political institutions that
have been maliciously eroded by the Bush administration.
Most importantly, the U.S. democratic heritage
needs to be restored through a genuine form of democracy wherein there is
transparency in key institutions of power, and the rule of law is
established to ensure accountability for all office holders. Such
accountability can be achieved through the declassification of national
security information.
This declassification process will allow the truth to
emerge about critical issues raised in this paper.
Political progressives around the world
fervently hope that Obama's election marks the starting point of a new
Hero's Journey for the United States of America - a genuine commitment to
Open Government would be a worthy response to such hope.
