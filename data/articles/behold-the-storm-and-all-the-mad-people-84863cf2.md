This below video powerfully presents the ideas in this essay.
My first spiritual
teacher, who also doubled as a martial arts instructor, taught that people
learn from repetition and impact. The video definitely delivers on the
impact and I hope my presentation of the words of many delivers on the
necessary repetition.
It is understandable when people without resources and
intelligence ignore all the warning signs but there is no excuse when
intellectually capable people stick their collective heads in the sand.
Egon von Greyerz
writes,
We now live in a world where governments
print worthless pieces of paper to buy other worthless pieces of paper
that, combined with worthless derivatives, finance assets whose values
are totally dependent on all these worthless debt instruments.
Thus most
of these assets are also worthless.
So the world financial system is a
house of cards where each instruments false value is artificially
supported by another instruments false value. The fuse of the world
financial market time bomb has been lit. There is no longer a question
of IF it will happen but only WHEN and HOW.
The world lives in blissful
ignorance of this.
Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner, Barack Obama,
the Wall
Street banks, and the corporate mainstream media are playing a giant
confidence game. It is a desperate gamble. The plan has been to
convince the population of the US that the economy is in full recovery mode.
The Burning Platform
First, the global economy is in dire
straits and riding the wave of a convoluted recovery built on fiat and
fantasy. So to get to the point (as if it is not painfully obvious);
there is no recovery!
I dont care how often CNBC, MSNBC, FOX, or CNN,
pull skewed data and automaton analysts from their ghastly dungeon of
disinformation, the fundamental dysfunctions of the American economy
remain unchanged.
The key here is the dollar and its inevitable demise,
which the establishment is trying desperately to hide until the last
possible moment. Over the next year we are likely to be buried in a
deluge of excuses, half-truths, and lies, all meant to divert attention
away from the word inflation as the masses begin to question just what
the hell is going on,
writes 'Giordano Bruno.'
The mainstream financial press as usual will be
used as a tool to mislead the public even as the storm hits them broadside.
The United States financial system, as it
exists, is making
war on its own citizens, and on the citizens of other countries,
by foisting the decrepit system on the rest of the world.
James West
After
the Federal Reserve went on its latest
rampage of printing money, Peter Schiff of Euro Pacific Capital said,
If bond prices failed to rise given such a
Herculean effort to lift them up, there can be only one direction for
them to go: down.
So as the winter opened her cold doors, the
bells of doom are ringing in the huge bond market meaning that a lot of
trouble is brewing on the horizon.
The big money realizes that the Fed is
fueling a trend of global inflation. And only a fool would want to be
stuck holding bonds when interest rates rise, writes Robert Prechter.
One can hear a storm like this approaching. It
sounds like a hundred freight trains converging on you.
The above video is
like this but reality is always so much worse than any presentation of it.
Storms like this are real and they do destroy property and kill people. What
is happening in the financial sphere though is so much worse for its going
to be like a storm of this destructive power touching down on all points of
the earth simultaneously.
Everyone everywhere will feel its destructive
capacity to destroy lives and wealth though obviously the wealthy that have
their wits about them have prepared more than others.
James Howard Kunstler, in a master document of the worlds fate for 2011
says,
As is the case now, first in the unraveling
of global financial arrangements a terrifying matrix of irresolvable
mutual obligations that are destined to be repudiated in an ugly way.
Everybody owes too much money to everybody else.
A worldwide game of
financial musical chairs is currently eliminating various nation-players
too weak to plant their asses in the diminishing chair-space. Iceland
dropped out first, then Greece, then Ireland, and so it goes.
Entering
2011, the trouble is that the world is out of runt countries to shove to
the sidelines. There are Portugal and Belgium to go, and from these on
all youve got are nations too big to fail and too broke to keep going,
the most conspicuous being Spain.
It is uncommon to conceptualize the world and
human history as an ongoing clash between the filthy rich and almost
everyone else, between the extractors of economic renters and the sellers of
debt, the oppressors and the oppressed.
Today we stand on the brink where
large swaths of unproductive private and public debt will not be repaid, and
sovereign countries will default on their obligations. International
monetary, political or strategic unions that rely on economic stability,
mutual trust and confidence will not be preserved in any meaningful form and
its going to be one hell of a ride down from here.
Governments will do anything to keep funds flowing.
Daniel R. Amerman
writes,
Something really interesting (and
terrifying) happens when you combine monetary inflation with asset
deflation in real terms (meaning the purchasing power of assets is
plummeting).
As the dollar price of the assets in ever-more-worthless
dollars climbs higher and higher, the purchasing power of those assets
drops lower and lower. This generates very high taxable profits that are
then taken by an increasingly desperate federal government.
Amerman continues,
Many people, looking at what has just been
presented, would see this as being a major reason to keep that deficit
spending right up there and maybe even get more aggressive about it.
This is indeed the position of many politicians and pundits, as well as
a number of mainstream economists. Unfortunately, there is a double
problem with this approach: theres no indication that its working
other than as a short term band-aid, and the cost of the band-aid
risks wiping out the value of money, savings and investment on a
nationwide basis.
Unfortunately it appears quite likely that there will be a crash in the
value of money itself. This is likely to be accompanied by a crash in
the purchasing power of financial assets. The stock market may collapse
in a way we havent seen since the last time we saw this level of
depression, that being the 1930s.
We are likely to see a tremendous bond
market crash as US government monetary creation and manipulation is
eventually overwhelmed by reality.
The Western public debt crisis is growing very
rapidly.
The absence of economic recovery in the United States, the
accelerated structural weakening of the United States in monetary, financial
as well as diplomatic affairs, and the global drying up of sources of cheap
finance are all leading to a storm of unprecedented proportions.
Ron Robins
writes,
Banks and the financial system will probably soon experience a new
round of massive real-estate-related losses and subsequent financial
institutions bankruptcies. Thus, a new major financial crisis will likely
soon engulf America, greatly impairing its lending facilities and creating a
severe scarcity of debt.
The biggest macro-economic
story of 2010 was
Europe:
Its falling apart, and there doesnt seem
to be anything thats going to stop this collapse.
Jim Willie
writes,
Remember in mid-2008 the
nation was told that the $1.4 trillion deficit would be reduced to below $1
trillion easily in 2009. It was not, and repeated the $1.4 trillion.
Remember in mid-2009 the nation was told that the previous two $1.4 trillion
deficits would be reduced to below $1 trillion easily in 2010.
It was not,
and repeated the $1.4 trillion. Finally, the US Govt deficits in current
projections are estimated to be well above $1 trillion, as reality has
struck. The $1T deficits are a permanent fixture. Thus the Quantitative
Easing #2 is in place, since the US Treasury does not want the shame from
failed auctions to reflect badly on the US Dollar or the other galaxy of
US$-based paper assets. They masquerade as containing value, when they are
largely trash items.
They can no longer compete against gold. If truth be
known, Wall Street executives are trashing their corporations and buying
gold in private accounts as counter-parties. They will someday dump their
corporate losses on the US Govt and ride into the sunset zillionaires.
Then
comes the US Treasury default.
Practical Economics
Enough of this high finance stuff. Lets look at how the common man is
fairing in all of this.
Public Workers Facing Outrage as Budget Crises Grow
reads
the headline in the New York Times.
Across the nation, a rising
irritation with public employee unions is palpable, as a wounded economy has
blown gaping holes in state, city, and town budgets, and revealed that some
public pension funds dangle perilously close to bankruptcy.
Everyone either on a pension or soon to deserve one might not get one or
will definitely lose ground as the money to pay them dries up.
It will
almost be like class warfare with people close to or in retirement being the
first in line to lose the basic structure of their lives. Equally, the salt
of society, its teachers, librarians, police, firemen, and just about
everyone else in local, city, and state governments are facing an apocalypse
in terms of their promised benefits and even their daily wages.
The young also are not having a good time with things these days either.
Europes Young Grow Agitated Over Future
Prospects is
the headline, also published in the Times. Many of the young
are getting fed up with how surreal and ultimately sad it is to be young in
the first world today.
The outrage of the young has erupted, sometimes
violently, on the streets of Greece and Italy in recent weeks, as the young
protest austerity measures and a rising reality and feeling of being
increasingly shut out of their own futures.
The young are facing a terrible job market.
Giuliano Amato, an economist and former
Italian prime minister, was even more blunt.
By now, only a few people
refuse to understand that youth protests arent a protest against the
university reform, but against a general situation in which the older
generations have eaten the future of the younger ones, he
recently told Corriere della Sera, Italys largest newspaper.
As a result, a deep malaise has set in among young people.
Some take to
the streets in protest; others emigrate to Northern Europe or beyond in
an epic brain drain of college graduate. But many more suffer in
silence, living in their childhood bedrooms well into adulthood because
they cannot afford to move out.

Conclusion:
Sooner or later all this dishonesty will
terminate in collapsing living standards, loss of public services,
growing civil disorder, and political crisis. You can get there via
deflation (no money) or via inflation (plenty of worthless money) but
the destination is the same.
I dont see how America fails to begin
arriving at that destination before Halloween 2011. Europe may get there
by springtime, anyway, dragging the rest of the developed world into a
vortex,
writes James Howard Kunstler.
