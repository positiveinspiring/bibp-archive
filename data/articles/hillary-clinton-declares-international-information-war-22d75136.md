US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
testifies before a Senate
Appropriations Committee on Capitol Hill
in Washington, DC, March 2,
2011
The US is losing the global information war,
Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton declared while appearing before a
congressional committee to ask for extra funds to spread US propaganda
through new media.
Clinton said existing private channels are not good enough to handle the
job, naming as rivals
Al Jazeera,
China's CCTV and
RT
- which she watches,
she added.
Clinton was defending her departments budget in front of the Houses
Committee on Foreign Affairs on Wednesday.
Clinton said the US should step up its propaganda effort and get back in
the game of doing what we do best.
During the Cold War we did a great job in getting Americas message out.
After the Berlin Wall fell we said, Okay, fine, enough of that, we are
done, and unfortunately we are paying a big price for it, she said. Our
private media cannot fill that gap.
We are in an information war and we are losing that war. Al Jazeera is
winning, the Chinese have opened a global multi-language television network,
the Russians have opened up an English-language network. Ive seen it in a
few countries, and it is quite instructive, she stated.
Things have changed a lot since the days when Western media outlets,
including BBC and CNN, had a monopoly on the coverage of world news.
More
and more viewers across the world tune into various foreign media to get a
fresh take on events.
It is all in the numbers. For instance, RTs presence on YouTube is a real
hit:
almost 300 million views, when CNN International is struggling to reach
3 million.
RTs constantly growing audience is an indication that
the days of media
monopoly are over and that people are demanding more multi-polar thinking.
One of the latest examples is Al Jazeeras coverage of the unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa, which by most accounts outshone the US medias
presentation of events.
Not everyone, however, is happy with the wider variety of media options. The
head of the federal agency that manages the USs government-run
international broadcasting has basically called all those foreign media
enemies.
Last year Walter Isaacson, who heads the federal agency that manages the
USs government-run international broadcasting, including the Voice of
America, warned against the influence of foreign media.
We cant allow ourselves to be out-communicated by
our enemies, he said,
in a now-infamous pitch to get his agency more funding.

Journalist and filmmaker Danny Schechter
says the US can no longer maintain a monopoly on information.
The United States feels defensive in part because it can no longer
monopolize not only the terms of authority in these countries, but also the
terms of the debate, he said.
There is other information out there. There
are other points of view and those points of view are profoundly damaging to
a country that believes that its point of view is the only point of view.
Shawn Powers, from the Center for International Media Education, agrees
that the US is fighting an information war, but says that Hillary Clinton is
overplaying the losing aspect of the US information campaign for political
reasons.
She is trying to defend the extravagant State Department budget, which I
agree with, but I think she is doing that in the face of tremendous
political pressure to cut funding for things like broadcasting that seem to
be repetitive with private news enterprises, he said.
What we saw
yesterday was her making some strong arguments on why we still need to
invest in international media, and broadcasting in particular.
Journalism professor Christopher Chambers believes that the likes of
stations like RT are a threat to Washington primarily because of the
corporatization of media in the US.
Basically you have news and entertainment in the United States that has
merged and is serving one of maybe three or four giant corporations, and all
they are concerned about is not gathering news, not reporting news, but
commentary on the news - punditry, if you will - and the entertainment slant
on the news, he said.
The more sensationalistic they can be, the more they can deliver a
demographic to their sponsors, that is all they care about, he added.
They
dont care about getting the facts, they dont care about having people on
the ground to get the real story. So you have a lot of inaccurate reporting,
you have a lot of incomplete reporting, but it serves the corporate purpose
because all they are really geared up for is making money.
