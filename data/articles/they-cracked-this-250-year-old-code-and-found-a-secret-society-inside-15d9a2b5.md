For more than 200
years, this book concealed the arcane rituals of an ancient order.
But cracking the code only
deepened the mystery.

The master wears an amulet
with a blue eye in the center. Before him, a candidate kneels in the
candlelit room, surrounded by microscopes and surgical implements.
The year
is roughly 1746. The initiation has begun.
The master places a piece of paper in front of
the candidate and orders him to put on a pair of eyeglasses.
Read, the
master commands.
The candidate squints, but its an impossible task. The
page is blank.
The candidate is told not to panic; there is
hope for his vision to improve. The master wipes the candidates eyes with a
cloth and orders preparation for the surgery to commence. He selects a pair
of tweezers from the table. The other members in attendance raise their
candles.
The master starts plucking hairs from the
candidates eyebrow. This is a ritualistic procedure; no flesh is cut. But
these are symbolic actions out of which none are without meaning, the
master assures the candidate.
The candidate places his hand on the masters
amulet. Try reading again, the master says, replacing the first page with
another. This page is filled with handwritten text.
Congratulations,
brother, the members say. Now you can see.
For more than 260 years, the contents of that
page - and the details of this ritual - remained a secret.
They were hidden
in a coded manuscript, one of thousands produced by secret societies in the
18th and 19th centuries. At the peak of their power, these clandestine
organizations, most notably the Freemasons, had hundreds of thousands of
adherents, from colonial New York to imperial St. Petersburg.
Dismissed
today as fodder for conspiracy theorists and History Channel specials, they
once served an important purpose:
Their lodges were safe houses where
freethinkers could explore everything from the laws of physics to the rights
of man to the nature of God, all hidden from the oppressive, authoritarian
eyes of church and state.
But largely because they were so secretive, little
is known about most of these organizations.
Membership in all but the
biggest died out over a century ago, and many of their encrypted texts have
remained uncracked, dismissed by historians as impenetrable novelties.
It was actually an accident that brought to
light the symbolic sight-restoring ritual. The decoding effort started as
a sort of game between two friends that eventually engulfed a team of
experts in disciplines ranging from machine translation to intellectual
history. Its significance goes far beyond the contents of a single cipher.
Hidden within coded manuscripts like these is a secret history of how
esoteric, often radical notions of science, politics, and religion spread
underground. At least thats what experts believe. The only way to know for
sure is to break the codes.
In this case, as it happens, the cracking began
in a restaurant in Germany.
For
years,
Christiane Schaefer and Wolfgang Hock
would meet regularly at an Italian bistro in Berlin. He would order pizza,
and she would get the penne allarrabbiata. The two philologists - experts
in ancient writings - would talk for hours about dead languages and obscure
manuscripts.
It was the fall of 1998, and
Schaefer
was about to leave Berlin to take a job in the linguistics department at
Uppsala University, north of Stockholm. Hock announced that he had a
going-away present for Schaefer.
She was a little surprised - a parting gift
seemed an oddly personal gesture for such a reserved colleague. Still more
surprising was the present itself: a large brown paper envelope marked with
the words top secret and a
series of strange symbols.
Schaefer opened it. Inside was a note that read,
Something for those long Swedish winter nights.
It was paper-clipped to
100 or so photocopied pages filled with a handwritten script that made no
sense to her whatsoever:
Arrows, shapes, and runes. Mathematical symbols
and Roman letters, alternately accented and unadorned. Clearly it was some
kind of cipher.
Schaefer pelted Hock with questions about the manuscripts
contents. Hock deflected her with laughter, mentioning only that the
original text might be Albanian. Other than that, Hock said, shed have to
find her own answers.
A few days later, on the train to Uppsala,
Schaefer turned to her present again. The ciphers complexity was
overwhelming: symbols for Saturn and Venus, Greek letters like pi and gamma,
oversize ovals and pentagrams.
Only two phrases were left unencoded:
Philipp 1866, written at the start of the manuscript, and Copiales 3″ at
the end.
Philipp was traditionally how Germans spelled the name.
Copiales
looked like a variation of the Latin word for to copy. Schaefer had no
idea what to make of these clues.
She tried a few times to catalog the symbols, in
hopes of figuring out how often each one appeared. This kind of frequency
analysis is one of the most basic techniques for deciphering a coded
alphabet. But after 40 or 50 symbols, shed lose track. After a few months,
Schaefer put the cipher on a shelf.
Thirteen years later, in January 2011,
Schaefer attended an Uppsala conference on computational linguistics.
Ordinarily talks like this gave her a headache. She preferred musty books to
new technologies and didnt even have an Internet connection at home. But
this lecture was different.
The featured speaker was
Kevin Knight, a University of
Southern California specialist in machine translation - the use of
algorithms to automatically translate one language into another.
With his stylish rectangular glasses, mop of
prematurely white hair, and wiry surfers build, he didnt look like a
typical quant. Knight spoke in a near whisper yet with intensity and
passion. His projects were endearingly quirky too. He built an algorithm
that would translate Dantes Inferno based on the users choice of
meter and rhyme scheme.
Soon he hoped to cook up software that could
understand the meaning of poems and even generate verses of its own.
Knight was part of an extremely small group of
machine-translation researchers who treated foreign languages like ciphers -
as if Russian, for example, were just a series of cryptological symbols
representing English words.
In code-breaking, he explained, the central job
is to figure out the set of rules for turning the ciphers text into plain
words:
which letters should be swapped, when to turn a phrase on its head,
when to ignore a word altogether.
Establishing that type of rule set, or
key, is the main goal of machine translators too.
Except that the key for
translating Russian into English is far more complex. Words have multiple
meanings, depending on context. Grammar varies widely from language to
language. And there are billions of possible word combinations.
But there are ways to make all of this more
manageable. We know the rules and statistics of English: which words go
together, which sounds the language employs, and which pairs of letters
appear most often. (Q is usually followed by a u, for
example, and quiet is rarely followed by bulldozer.) There are only so
many translation schemes that will work with these grammatical parameters.
That narrows the number of possible keys from billions to merely millions.
The next step is to take a whole lot of educated
guesses about what the key might be.
Knight uses whats called an
expectation-maximization algorithm to do that. Instead of relying on a
predefined dictionary, it runs through every possible English translation of
those Russian words, no matter how ridiculous; itll interpret
as yes, horse, to break dance, and quiet!
Then, for each one of
those possible interpretations, the algorithm invents a key for transforming
an entire document into English - what would the text look like if
meant break dancing?
The algorithms first few thousand attempts are
always way, way off. But with every pass, it figures out a few words. And
those isolated answers inch the algorithm closer and closer to the correct
key.
Eventually the computer finds the most statistically likely set of
translation rules, the one that properly interprets
as yes and
as quiet.
The algorithm can also help break codes, Knight
told the Uppsala conference - generally, the longer the cipher, the better
they perform. So he casually told the audience, If youve got a long coded
text to share, let me know.
Funny, Schaefer said to Knight at a reception
afterward.
I have just the thing.

A copy of the cipher
arrived at Knights office a few weeks later.
Despite his comments at the
conference, Knight was hesitant to start the project; alleged ciphers often
turned out to be hoaxes. But Schaefers note stapled to the coded pages was
hard to resist. Here comes the top-secret manuscript!! she wrote. It
seems more suitable for long dark Swedish winter nights than for sunny
California days - but then youve got your hardworking and patient
machines!
Unfortunately for Knight, there was a lot of
human grunt work to do first. For the next two weeks, he went through the
cipher, developing a scheme to transcribe the coded script into
easy-to-type, machine-readable text.
He found 88 symbols and gave them each
a unique code:
became lip
became o..
became zs
By early March he had entered the first 16 pages of the cipher
into his computer.
Next Knight turned to his
expectation-maximization algorithm. He asked the program what the
manuscripts symbols had in common. It generated clusters of letters that
behaved alike - appearing in similar contexts. For example, letters with
circumflexes ()
were usually preceded by
or
.
There were at least 10 identifiable character clusters that repeated
throughout the document. The only way groups of letters would look and act
largely the same was if this was a genuine cipher - one he could break.
This is not a hoax; this is not random. I can solve this one, he told
himself.
A particular cluster caught his eye: the
ciphers unaccented Roman letters used by English, Spanish, and other
European languages.
Knight did a separate frequency analysis to see which of
those letters appeared most often. The results were typical for a Western
language. It suggested that this document might be the most basic of
ciphers, in which one letter is swapped for another - a kids decoder ring,
basically. Maybe, Knight thought, the real code was in the Roman alphabet,
and all the funny astronomical signs and accented letters were there just to
throw the reader off the scent.
Of course, a substitution cipher was only simple
if you knew what language it was in. The German Philipp, the Latin
copiales, and Hocks allusion to Albanian all hinted at different
tongues.
Knight asked his algorithm to guess the
manuscripts original language. Five times, it compared the entire
cryptotext to 80 languages. The results were slow in coming - the algorithm
is so computationally intense that each language comparison took five hours.
Finally the computer gave the slightest preference for German.
Given the
spelling of Philipp, that seemed as good an assumption as any. Knight didnt
speak a word of German, but he didnt need to. As long as he could learn
some basic rules about the language - which letters appeared in what
frequency - the machine would do the rest.
While his family
got ready for spring vacation - a history tour of the East Coast - Knight
looked for patterns in the cipher. He saw that one common cipher letter,
,
was often followed by a second symbol,
.
They appeared together 99 times; a
frequently came after:
.
Knight reviewed common German letter
combinations. He noticed that C is almost always followed by H, and CH is
often followed by T. This sequence is used all the time in German words like
licht (light) and macht (power).
,
Knight guessed, might be cht. It was his first major break.
During his vacation, as his daughters played on
their iPads at night in the hotel room, Knight scribbled in his orange
notebook, tinkering with possible solutions to the cipher. So far what he
had was a simple substitution code. But that left scores of cipher symbols
with no German equivalent.
So one evening Knight shifted his approach. He
tried assuming that the manuscript used a more complex code - one that used
multiple symbols to stand for a single German letter.
Knight put his theory to the test. He assumed,
for example, that
,
,
and
all stood for I. It worked. He found others, and soon he started assembling
small words, like
or der (the in German), which Knight recognized from World War II
movies.
Then he got his first big word:
,
or candidat, followed by
,
or antwortet (the candidate answers). The ciphers wall of
secrecy was crumbling.
But some of the ciphers symbols - especially
iconic ones like
,
,
and
- remained baffling. Worse, he couldnt get German translations for any of
the ciphers standard Roman letters.
On March 26, Knight reviewed his notebook. The
words of his first phrase - Der candidat antwortet - were separated
by an
and an
.
That made no sense if the coded
and
stood for German letters. Thats when Knight realized how wrong his initial
assumption had been. The unaccented Roman letters didnt spell out the code.
They were the spaces that separated the words of
the real message, which was actually written in the glyphs and accented
text.

On March 31,
Knight sent an email to Schaefer and her boss,
Beáta Megyesi,
head of Uppsalas department of linguistics and philology, who was also
interested in the manuscript.
I think Ive been making some progress, he
wrote, and included two lines from the cipher: dieser schlag id das zeiche und der anfang de jenige vertraulichheit die der
bruder von jetzo an als geselle von uns zunerwar
Schaefer stared at the screen. She had spent a
dozen years with the cipher. Knight had broken the whole thing open in just
a few weeks.
The message in these two lines was almost as
remarkable. Schaefer made a few tweaks and sent back a tentative
translation: This stroke is the sign/the symbol and the beginning of the
confidentiality/familiarity that the brother, from now on companion, can
expect of us
It was an initiation ritual, Schaefer said.
Geselle literally means a companion.
But she knew the term was also
used in fraternal orders - clandestine societies like the Freemasons. In
this context, a geselle was a rank in a secret society.
Schaefers boss, Megyesi - a 41-year-old
Hungarian émigré - was especially taken by the ciphers contents. I would
not mind being chased by a secret org, she emailed Knight. At night, after
she was done managing her department of 450 courses and 25 professors and
after she put her twins to bed, Megyesi sat at the computer, turning the
symbols into text. She and Knight started emailing multiple times a day
about the cipher - and signing their emails in Copiale cipher text.
But they still hadnt cracked the codes big
symbols - especially
,
which they transcribed as lip. Megyesi and Schaefer were pretty sure it
stood for a word, not a letter. But they werent sure what word it meant.
Then one night in the middle of April, while
Megyesi was working late in her office, she stared absentmindedly at the
neatly arranged folders on her desk. She looked at a page containing the lip
symbol.
Schaefer walked into her office just as she was thinking about this.
Megyesi looked up.
This symbol, Megyesi said to Schaefer,
its not a lip. Its an eye.

As it turned out,
Schaefer had made a discovery of her own.
A phrase in
the Copiale text, a
reference to the light hand required to be a master of the society, had
seemed familiar to her.
So she dug up an
academic article she had read some time before about a secret order in
Germany that called itself the Great Enlightened Society of Oculists. The
light hand was mentioned in their bylaws.
It was a massive breakthrough. Active in the
mid-18th century, the Oculists fixated on both the anatomy and symbolism of
the eye. They focused on sight as a metaphor for knowledge.
And they
performed surgery on the eye.
We exceed all other [healers] by being able
to pierce all cataracts, whether theyre fully developed or not, the group
boasted in its public - and uncoded - bylaws.
Centered in the
town of Wolfenbüttel, Germany,
the Oculists, it was believed, played the role of gatekeepers to the
burgeoning field of ophthalmology.
They kept out the charlatans who could
cause someone to,
lose their eyesight forever.
On their crest, the Oculists featured a cataract
needle and three cats (which, of course, can see in near darkness).
In their
bylaws, the Oculists emphasis on the masters light hand seemed to be a
reference to members surgical skill. And they appeared to have a rather
progressive attitude; women could be Oculists, just like men.
Schaefer contacted the state archives in
Wolfenbüttel, which housed a collection of Oculist materials. The archives
had a coded text just like the Copiale - and some cool amulets too.
Megyesi plunged even deeper into the cipher. But
the text confused her. The weird rituals it described didnt exactly seem
like medical school classes. Although the Copiale mentioned the masters
light hand, Megyesi couldnt find anything in the coded text about eye
surgery or cataracts.
Instead the Copiale noted that the master had to,
show his skill in reading and writing of our cipher.
These Oculists might
have been presenting themselves as ophthalmologists in public. But inside
the orders chambers, the light hand must have meant something else.
Could
it have been about keeping secrets through cryptology?
Even with its code broken, the Copiales swirl
of ritual and double-talk was getting harder and harder to follow -
especially for someone whose experience with secret orders was drawn mainly
from cheesy movies. Megyesi knew she needed help figuring out what these
societies were all about.
So she asked around for someone who could tell her
what really happened in those candlelit initiation rooms.

Officially,
Andreas Önnerfors is a historian of ideas.
But he spends a lot of his time
as one of 50 or so university researchers in the world seriously examining
the historical and cultural impact of secret societies.
When Megyesi
contacted him,
Önnerfors readily agreed to read this newly decoded document from a
clandestine order.
Like the kid who sees candies, I could not resist, he
says, tugging gently at his ascot. Plus, my boss wasnt there.
They agreed to meet in September in the
castlelike university library in Lund, Önnerfors cobblestoned hometown in
southern Sweden.
Megyesi and Schaefer came down from Uppsala with the
Copiale manuscript.
Knight flew in from California.
Hundreds of thousands of Europeans belonged to
secret societies in the 18th century, Önnerfors explained to Megyesi.
In
Sweden alone, there were more than a hundred orders. Though they were
clandestine, they were often remarkably inclusive. Many welcomed noblemen
and merchants alike - a rare egalitarian practice in an era of strict social
hierarchies.
That made the orders dangerous to the state.
They also
frequently didnt care about their adherents Christian denomination, making
these orders - especially the biggest of them, Freemasonry - an implicit
threat to the authority of
the Catholic Church.
In 1738 Pope Clement XII
forbade all Catholics from joining a Masonic lodge.
Others implied that the
male-only groups might be hotbeds of sodomy. Not long after, rumors started
that members of these orders actually worshipped the devil.
These societies were the incubators of
democracy, modern science, and ecumenical religion. They elected their own
leaders and drew up constitutions to govern their operations. It wasnt an
accident that Voltaire, George Washington, and Ben Franklin were all active
members.
And just like todays networked radicals, much of their power was
wrapped up in their ability to stay anonymous and keep their communications
secret.
After reading the Oculists cipher, Önnerfors
suggested that it described one of the more extreme groups.
Forget the
implicit threats to the state or church. In part of the Copiale, theres
explicit talk about slaying the tyrannical,
three-headed monster who
deprive[s] man of his natural freedom.
Theres even a call for a general
revolt.
Remember, Önnerfors told the code-breakers, this book was written
in the 1740s - 30 years before the Declaration of Independence.
To someone
at the time, he added, this would be like reading a manifesto from a
terrorist organization.
To Önnerfors, decoding the Copiale was a
significant achievement.
Traditionally, historians have just ignored
documents like this, because they dont have the tools to make sense of
them. Thats why the Oculists passed as early surgeons for so long. But
there are scores of these enciphered documents - many in Lund alone.
Some concern new rites of a fraternal order;
others could detail political movements. Theres no way to tell for sure,
because theyre cryptologically sealed. Theres a whole secret history of
the West waiting to be told.
There are so many more codes.
Decoding the Copiale
Cracking the so-called
Copiale cipher
was a three-step process. First the characters had to be rendered as
machine-readable text:
became eh, and
became lip.
Next, software analyzed the behavior of
the cipher letters and guessed that the Copiales original language
was German. The code-breaking team then was able to translate the
text into German and finally into English, revealing a secret manual
of an esoteric society.
Heres how it worked.
