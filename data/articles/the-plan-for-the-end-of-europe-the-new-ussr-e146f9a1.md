"If you controlled the meaning of The Good,
and you had unlimited propaganda resources and access to the press,
and if you also had control over the Armed Forces and the police,
you could build a new society in short order.
You could wreck centuries of tradition in a few decades.
And if you had the education system in your back pocket,
you could wipe out the memory of what formerly existed.
No one would remember. No one would care.
This is happening now, in Europe.
Ignorance is enlightenment."
(The Underground, Jon Rappoport)
One of the basic principles of elite Globalism is:
the end of borders, the end of separate nations.
The European Union was built for this purpose, step by step, out of the ashes of World War 2:
a super-bureaucracy and political management system for the whole continent.
But that was not enough. There had to be a way to wipe out separate and sovereign nations at ground level, to irrevocably change the landscape. It is open borders; floods of immigrants; "replacement populations"; an influx of people who have no intention of accepting the customs and way of life in their new homes. The end result?
A de facto reconfiguring of national populations, so that, when you look at the makeup of Europe 20 years from now, you will say:
"Why do we think of Germany or France or England? They don't really exist. All of Europe is a vast mix of immigrants. Europe is really one country now. So let's erase all those old artificial borders."
Eventually, even uttering words like "Swedes, Norwegians, Germans, French, Dutch " will be considered micro (or macro) aggressions against the "people of Europe." Of course, in reaching this point, there will be a certain amount of chaos and violence. The EU is banking on its ability to control it, to put it down where necessary, and to maintain its hold as the one and only governing force in Europe. On a cultural level, names like Locke, Shakespeare, Goethe, Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Lorca, Goya, Cezanne, Monet, Van Gogh, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Dante, Galileo, Faraday, and even "modern" names like Bartok, Stravinsky, Rimbaud, Orwell, and Camus will be vague dusty ghosts that provoke uncomprehending stares.
"The past is dead." "Oh, but don't worry about that. The important thing is, every person living in Europe is a citizen of Europe, and is entitled to benefits. This is humane, this is The Good, this is the triumph of the benevolent State. Nothing else matters."
All European languages will eventually be reduced. Who has the right to speak words that the majority of people can't understand? What I'm sketching in here is the grid that will be laid over Europe. And of course, as automation comes on with a rush, many "citizen-workers of Europe" will become unnecessary. Even great corporations will fall, because they won't be able to sell their products to an impoverished population. They'll hope against hope that the billions of people in the East, China and India, will give them new markets. Against this background, the individual human being will be looked at, from the top, as a cipher, a unit in "models and algorithms." The question is,
How many individuals will take the bait and regard themselves as mere "parts" in the overall system? How many will give in and consider their future a function of how much they can obtain from The State, free of charge? How many will come to believe that their power, as individuals, is inconsequential - or even a delusion?

Why do I bother bringing this up?
Because, regardless of the prevailing collectivist mindset - propagandized and promoted and exploited from an elite level - State repression, in all its forms, falls on each individual. If the very concept of the individual is wiped out, what is left? In 1859, John Stuart Mill wrote:
If it were felt that the free development of individuality is one of the leading essentials of well-being there would be no danger that liberty should be undervalued.
Conversely, when the free development of individuality is of no concern, liberty will die. Boris Pasternak, the Russian novelist and poet, who knew a thing or two about political repression, wrote (1960):
They [the Soviet bureaucrats] don't ask much of you. They only want you to hate the things you love and to love the things you despise.
This reversal is being imposed now, in Europe. Defectors from the old USSR would recognize it in an instant, having lived through it themselves. The European version seems softer and gentler, but that is just a matter of strategy. The culture is being cooked more slowly. But just because secret police aren't knocking on doors in the middle of the night and making mass arrests, that isn't a sign that individual freedom reigns. A number of European political leaders are telling their constituencies,
"You have no right to oppose the flood of immigration on any grounds. To do so, to utter such public statements, is an offense."
Does that sound familiar? The wet dream of every collectivist is coming true. All power at the top; all conformity (called "unity") everywhere else. The new USSR. In the old days, the East German police kept records on every citizen and blanketed the population with snitches and spies. The modern Surveillance State has replaced that, searching for "nodes of discontent." Collectivists may pay lip service to the dangers of State surveillance, but when it is used to root out people who can't envision a better world based on, among other features, open borders, well, this is just an enforcement of The Good upon those who can't discover it for themselves. If The Humanitarian Way needs a nudge and boost, why not? For dyed-in-the-wool collectivists, freedom isn't just a roadblock; it's an irrelevant illusion. It never existed. All humans are operating according to programs, and have been since birth. Therefore, install a better program, by any means necessary and available. Produce "kinder people." This is both a political and a technological imperative. Open borders and unlimited immigration is a good test case. For people who feel imposed upon, who feel their communities are being torn apart, who feel personally threatened, who feel this is, indeed, a covert operation to transform Europe into a new USSR, there is a need for re-education at the deepest level possible.
Because, surely, such people are suffering from profound disorders. Their circuits are crossed. Their brains are defective. They can't see the larger picture. They would never be able to see, for example, the wisdom of the words of Zbigniew Brzezinski, David Rockerfeller's alter ego, who wrote, in 1969:
The nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state.

Here is the Globalist tactician at work, a man who seems to hate the old USSR, but is seeking to install a version of the same collectivism, through other means. If Lenin were alive today, he would look out over Europe and agree that his agenda is alive and well.
He might object to the relatively slow pace. He might want more violence. But he would grudgingly acknowledge that his descendants have discovered a few new tricks. He would have to approve of the "humanitarian altruism," and the way it is being modeled and manipulated, so that the edifice of The Good appears as a shining beacon in the darkness. Nice movie. Excellent production design. Tears of sympathy rolling down the cheeks of the audience. Minds reduced to one constant:
we must care for the less fortunate.
Trillions and trillions of dollars devoted to elicit that sentiment, regardless of the circumstances, or the true malignant outcome, or the actual sinister intent of the elite artists of reality.
