# The First Earth Battalion - Dare to Think the Unthinkable, Ideas and 
Ideals for Soldiers Everywhere

[PROJECT] FOREWORD
The track of time comes hurtling up out of the past, from
somewhere billions of years ago back in history. It flicks by us
as we stand here now in the present and then thrusts on for
billions of years out ahead of us, out into the future, bound
for some place called infinity.
Two things we know about time: its march is inexorable
and it
always gives rise to change. Change, then, is like time,
inexorable, inevitable and pervasive -- and so powerful and
complex a thing that in just five billion years, change has
produced, from inorganic matter and countless millions of
experiments, complex living things such as social insects and
mankind.
Any concept of change is a concept of time. Thus any concept of
change must involve past, present, and future. Task Force
Deltas effort, as a concept of change, needs the track of time
the lessons of history, the realities of the present, and the
dreams and visions of the future.
Our "First Earth Battalion" is a place to dream. A place to
think the unthinkable. Its the prime place to put our thoughts
of the future just as we must maintain our perspective of the
past and contact with the complexities of the present.
Its an
"Earth" battalion because of what we know about a shrinking
world, and about interdependencies among people, and nations,
and natural resources
interdependencies which everyday are
becoming more evident to us all. Its a battalion because our
study effort is directed to our Army, and the battalion is an
entity which all of us soldiers from top to bottom, can
comprehend.

[AUTHORS] FOREWORD
Making this planet whole
requires the ethical use of force. But
even subcultures of force must evolve into a master culture. The
Army is no exception.
Soldiers can be the principal moral ethical basis on which
things political can harmonize in the name of the Earth.
[Editors note: The following are the headings and
textual portions of illustrated briefing slides compiled into a
booklet and self-published as "The First Earth Battalion" by
Channon in 1979. Spelling errors have been corrected, but all
ellipses (
) were the authors rather than the editors.]
CIVILIZATION
-
Earthkind has grown from pack to
village
and then from village to tribe, then from tribe to
territory
and from territory to nation.
-
It is time to go from nation to
planet.
-
The First Earth Battalion hereby
declares its primary allegiance to the planet.
THE WARRIOR MONK
Chinese monks were often attacked by robbers.
They developed a new fighting system
based on using the force of the attacker against him. Likewise
the soldiers of the First Earth will learn martial arts with the
same ethical basis.
No Earth soldier shall be denied the
kingdom of heaven because he or she is used as an instrument of
indiscriminate war.
The conscience will be developed
together with the ability to neutralize the opponent.
THE EARTH BATTALION IS AND IS
BECOMING
The Earth Battalion is potential oriented, not mission oriented,
so any definition of what it is or does tends to limit what it
can become
At the moment it is a spirit among other things.
By 1990 it may be a pilot community of warrior-monks who
completely recycle all resources, live amidst new nuclear
reactors and waiting deployment to tension spots.
A think tank methodology for the
U.S. Army -- a banner for the closet greathearts wherever they
are -- a bonding agent for the idealist activists in the service
and out -- a home for the ethical evolution of force -- an
alternate form of service to the planet.
PIONEERS
The pioneering spirit is not dead in America! Many of the Earth
Battalion ideas are taken from
the New Age.
This small sample of New Age groups
shows there is plenty of gold left in the hills of the mind,
body and spirit. The rush is on!

STRUCTURE WITHOUT STATUS
Everyone in the First Earth is equally important in the eyes of
the organization and will be provided for accordingly. Status is
achieved by the skill with which you do your chosen task. Its
not important that you move up in the organization
only that
your skill level moves up. Leaders will be those [soldiers]
whose chosen skills are group interworking and spiritual
development.
UNIFORMS
WITHOUT UNIFORMITY
Always allowing for diversity
we can share the ways that humans
are all wonderfully unique. The uniform
must serve the soldiers given task
but must equally serve to share the most precious gift we each
have to share
our personality.
Common banners will serve to share the corporate Earth Battalion
personality.
[The picture shows a "Battalion Samurai Battle Mantle"]
UNITY POWERED BY DIVERSITY
Synergy is possible when every soldier brings his or her
individual best to the group task. It is multiplied in strength
again if that soldier truly loves the other members of the unit.
Then we shall have the maximum combat power available.
Things like Fullers
tensegrivity
illustrate how the maximum in individual tension can be held
delicately in check by group unity -- thereby generating the
maximum potential energy.
The vector equilibrium, the visible structure, plus LOVE = the
invisible bonding.
OMNI-DIRECTIONAL THOUGHT
The First Earth is not mission oriented it is potential
oriented. That means we shall continue to look everywhere to
find non-destructive methods of control.
J.F.C. Fuller, the father of mechanized warfare, was an
omni-directional thinker and a member of the world of the
occult. [EN5]
Be a guerrilla guru: [explore] the occult, the new age, the
traditional, eastern philosophy, [and] space age technology.
SUPRA
SEX
Jobs in the First Earth are based on capabilities. Sex, age,
color, or religious preferences are not considerations.
Culture has, however, programmed men
and women so that they feel pressure to relate to each other
sexually.
This sexual protocol can be overcome
by a series of extended exercises requiring the absolute
interdependence of all participants until a level is trust is
developed that supersedes and rises above any kind of sexual
relationship.
Fortunately love is still the
by-product.
MISSIONS
The President just needs a wider range of options to respond to
the 1980s. Force as a concept has lost much of its legitimacy.
The time has come to take the lead in solving the problems of
tomorrow.

REASONS TO BE
Soldiers are in the business of life and death. As a leader
during war, I must know that if my soldiers are to die
that
its for the right reasons. When at peace they deserve nothing
less than a chance of personal evolution.
Soldiers can be a real part of the evolution of this Earth.
Anything less
is just something less.
INTELLIGENT INITIATIVE
In the martial arts, one learns a number of possible
countermoves against different types of possible enemies.
These
practice battles are done over and over until they become
instinct. Likewise in the Earth Battalion all plausible
engagements are war-gamed until each soldier has the routine
cold. In this way the battalion can operate in the absence of
commands from its leaders, who may be out of touch, because of
the new realities of modern warfare.
[A chart compares "martial art stances" (e.g., prepare left,
block left, en garde, prepare right) to a flowchart reading:]
If you are overrun -- move to the nearest road junction, take
control of the buildings, wait for his towed artillery, destroy
all you can
till you have lost an offensive punch, then
exfiltrate [sneak out] or surrender to save life.
PEOPLE
All warrior monks, but an interdependence of New Age skills as
well.
[The graphic shows the following skills, all emanating from a
central Spirit Wizard]
BATTLE
TUNING
Using traditional and New Age ideas:
-
Rise
-
Yogic cat stretch
-
Primal scream and leap
-
Belgian waffle
-
Ginseng tab regulator
-
Speed [ amphetamines] or
morning thunder tea [EN6]
-
Primal low frequency lights
-
Paced primal rock [music] in
our ears
-
Discordant sounds for them
[the enemy]
-
Advance
TOOLS
Just like many systems
when a nation or government becomes old, it is so full of its
ideas [that] it has no room for new ones. Well, there are New
Age ideas with great power for the first body that decides to
systematically use them.
THE EARTH BATTALION WILL HEAR THEM ALL
[The accompanying illustration shows a rucksack containing body
vest music (e.g., a WalkmanÂ®), night vision foodstuffs, natural
foods, dried munchie packs, divining tools (divining rods had
been used in Vietnam to find Viet Cong tunnels with at least as
much success as CIA sonar systems), and ginseng regulators.]
MARKING THE TRAIL
The American Indian revealed himself as an individual by his
distinctive ornamentation. His shield in some cases was more
complete as a representation of his skills and predisposition
than the modern soldiers personnel file.
Earth Battalion soldiers will be encouraged to represent
themselves well in their dress, and wear a twelve-pointed star
with each axis clipped to reveal a dimension on a standard
personality inventory test. [EN7]
FIT TO FIGHT
Recently a world class health expert revealed his formula for
being perfectly fit. At the heart of good health, he chose a
positive mental attitude. Next in importance was aerobic
exercise to get oxygen spread throughout the body. Finally he
broke down foods into the following priority:
-
Nuts/seeds/grains
-
Vegetables (raw)
-
Fruit
Then the others -- way down the
list.
THE DELIVERY OF FIRES
Precision delivery [of artillery fires] is a function of clear
and calm calculations. The battalion Tactical Operations Center
will employ every New Age centering tool to ensure our fire
coordinators do their job of neutralization surgically.
[Equipment shown for this New Age
Tactical Operations Center included:]
Samadi tank for command decisions. [Samadi tanks are isolation
tanks said to provide "an ideal environment for relaxation and
stress reduction, meditation, and the exploration of
consciousness." Above the door is a sign reading: "Centering
with mentations prior to entering."]
Neutralization oriented electronic map display. [This was
similar to what was already becoming standard in naval Combat
Information Centers.]
Ergonomic settings [as opposed to the traditional field table,
tent or tracked vehicle, and plywood map board].
[While working, the staff updated their map display while taking
a] Trip through bamboo sounds.
MAP DISPLAY
With the advent of electronic display many variations of maps
are possible on the same surface. Some ideas for the modern
battlefield are:
-
Relief for direct-fire
weapons.
-
Patterns to show gas or
smoke coverage.
-
Building relief for MOUT
(military operations in urbanized terrain).
-
Strip maps for road
movement.
MAP SYMBOLS
See how abstract our current symbols are. They clutter the map
with Order of Battle [3rd Battalion, 37th Infantry (Mechanized)]
and lack a great deal of important targeting data [such as
effective strength].
[On a First Earth Battalion map
display:]
-
Tank units look like tanks.
-
Larger units mean larger
symbols.
-
If they [tank units] are
moving, the road wheels ***pulse***.
-
If you need their state of
vulnerability press the top of the symbol. (These two
units are under the cover of smoke.)
-
If you need their projected
power, press the front of the weapon (the mobility and
range of this weapons system).
-
If you need their potential
[power], press the back of the symbol (unit strength,
POL [petroleum, oil, and lubricants], ammo, morale, etc.
are presented in a series of scalar dimensions).
-
If you must have the Order
of Battle [3rd Battalion, 37th Infantry (Mechanized)],
then press the bottom of the symbol.
YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED -- NO MORE.
NEW AGE SYNTHESIS FOR A SAMURAI
-
Seek your own personal path to
God
-
Actively improve your physical
condition.
-
Master mental self control for
combat.
-
Understand others.
-
Reinforce team interdependence.
-
Actively serve people and
planet.
-
Indulge in happiness and humor.
TYPICAL BATTLE SCENARIO FIRST EARTH
They parachuted in that morning and stood in a long line facing
each opposing army. The Earth Battalion satellite above beamed
this image to the globe.
The Earth watched as this potential
catastrophe awaited the conscience of one of the two [rival]
army leaders to set. For they would have to bloody the Earth
Battalion people in their path before they could attack -- and
the world would know.
SPIRITUAL TOOLS
The Universe yields wonderful energies for those who rise above
physical mechanics. The Earth Battalion will practice
non-denominational techniques for spiritual bonding.
It is our right and they [non-denominational meditation
techniques] shall make us stronger.
CONSCIENCE CORPS
When our Earth Battalion people become families and we hope they
will, they will then leave the attack battalions and go to the
nuclear release sites of each nation with a nuclear strike
capability.
In this way they will be a clear and present
reminder of what exists at the other end of a button. [The
accompanying illustration shows families living in tents in the
middle of a desert.]
EARTH PRAYER
Mother Earth
my life support
system
as a soldier
I must drink your blue water
live
inside your red clay and eat your green skin.
I pray
my boots will always kiss your face and my footsteps
match your heartbeat.
Carry my body through space and time
you are my connection
to the Universe
and all that comes after.
I am yours and you are mine.
I salute you.
THE WARRIOR NET
A primary function of the First Earth is to communicate ideas.
Set up a network of information within your army and with
friends in any army. Soon continental coordination will emerge
and then we will consider communications media other than the
mail and telephone.
Let this battalion grow wherever there is interest.

EN6. As early as 1883 the
Bavarian Army experimented with issuing cocaine to its
soldiers during their annual maneuvers. Subsequent
researches into chemically-enhanced militaries resulted in
the introduction of amphetamine powders in 1927 (the mostly
African American drivers of the Red Ball Express were the
best-known US users of World War II), the creation of
anabolic steroids in 1958, and the integration of
psychotropic drug research with virtual reality computer
research in 1991.

EN7. As a counterpoint, some
recent evidence suggests that standard personality inventory
tests tend to favor white, middle-class values, frequently
discriminate against minorities, and reveal little more than
the test-takers skill at taking standard personality
inventory tests.

EN8. The well-known martial arts
writer Robert W. Smith was approached regarding this
project, and in a letter to the editor, he said, "I said
this is BS, include me out. Really. This was a time of big
military budgets and when they were trying to replace guns
with ESP, etc. CIA at same time were trying to get Uri
Geller, et al., to visualize Soviet missile sites." For
