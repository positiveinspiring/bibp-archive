"To most people war is a supreme evil among
human events, to be avoided if at all possible.
And yet, we go right on
having wars. To those who rule nations, war is a tool of power which is
used deliberately. War can be used for external reasons, such as to
increase the geographical extent of a nation's power.
More importantly,
war provides the perfect excuse for a government to impose increased
controls on its own people. By citing "national security" the government
can persuade the people that even highly dictatorial controls are for
their own good."
Introduction to the
Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER
The Dr. Peter Beter
AUDIO LETTER series grew out of Dr. Beter's
collaboration with supporters who learned about Dr. Beter by way of radio
talk shows in 1974.
At that time Dr. Beter was in great demand to
appear on talk shows nationwide, which he did in most cases by long-distance
telephone hookup from his residence in suburban Washington, D.C. After many
years as a highly successful Washington attorney, government official and
international legal and financial consultant, Dr. Beter had become famous in
1973 as the author of a best-selling book,
The Conspiracy Against the Dollar.
In his talk shows Dr. Beter had a habit of saying things which sounded
preposterous at the time, but which were proven correct later on. Early in
1973 he declared that Vice President Spiro Agnew would be swept up in a
sudden scandal beginning in late summer that would lead quickly to his
resignation. At the time Agnew was flying high, and it sounded like an
unlikely turn of events. But it happened, right on schedule.
In the spring of 1974, Dr. Beter described a sequence of events by which the
Watergate Scandal would make Richard Nixon the first U.S. President in
history to resign. At the time, Watergate seemed to be running out of steam,
and Nixon appeared to be "toughing it out." Even less believably, Dr. Beter
described a secret agreement which he said existed by which then-Vice
President Gerald Ford would nominate
Nelson Rockefeller to be his new Vice
President after Nixon resigned.
In the spring of 1974 those things sounded
hard to believe indeed. But they took place.
Dr. Beter claimed that events like these, while shocking to the public, were
planned far in advance. He said that they were known within certain
intelligence and even business circles here in America and abroad. Drawing
upon his extensive contacts with these circles, Dr. Beter was making public
what the privileged few already knew.
Having begun as skeptical listeners to Dr. Beter's radio appearances, a
small group of private citizens became increasingly concerned as they saw
Dr. Beter's revelations proven correct, time after time. They decided to
investigate further, and finally contacted him. In September, 1974, Audio
Books, Inc., was founded by these supporters of Dr. Beter to provide an
avenue by which Dr. Beter could make his reports public without censorship
or cutoff by those who controlled the radio waves.
After several individual AUDIO BOOK tapes, the
Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER series began in 1975.
About Dr. Beter
(Born June 21, 1921; died March 14, 1987)
Dr. Peter Beter (yes, it rhymes) first came to widespread popular attention
in 1973, through his best-selling nonfiction book,
The Conspiracy Against the Dollar. It was a gripping tale of international economic
intrigue and monetary manipulation, carried out by the coordinated action of
multinational corporations grown more powerful than many of their host
countries.
The objective: to deliberately undermine and
ultimately destroy the United States dollar, as a major tool of political
and economic conquest under the banner of a "new imperialism." A crescendo
of unhappy consequences were to be expected: an accelerating economic
"stagflation" (a now-popular word coined years
ago by Dr. Beter),
deteriorating financial status of municipal and state governments, deepening
social unrest, increasing tensions over the Panama Canal, and more.
Events during the past decade have followed to
an astonishing degree the blueprint which Dr. Beter revealed in his book.
In September 1974 Dr. Beter acquired a new distinction as "the man who
opened Fort Knox." The previous April Dr. Beter had charged in congressional
testimony that the legendary U.S. Bullion Depository at Fort Knox had been
looted of America's monetary gold hoard allegedly stored there. He stood
ready to present evidence and witnesses to substantiate his charges.
But neither a grand jury nor a congressional
inquiry into the matter materialized... so Dr. Beter then took his case
directly to the public. Through lectures, radio talk shows, and publication
of his charges in a tabloid newspaper (National Tattler), he was able to put
such intense pressure on the federal government that a completely
unprecedented step was taken in order to still the public outcry. The U.S.
Treasury Department arranged a so-called "gold inspection" visit for a few
Congressmen and 100 invited newsmen on September 23, 1974.
Significantly, however, Dr. Beter himself was
not among those invited...nor was any other outside expert on gold. The
celebrated Fort Knox visit and the so-called "gold audit" which followed
contained many irregularities which the Treasury Department has never
explained.
In AUDIO LETTER tapes #14
and #15
(July and August 1976), Dr. Beter made
public intelligence he had been given that the Soviet Union was planting
short-range underwater missiles in U.S. territorial waters in preparation
for a surprise nuclear attack.
In issue #15 he listed navigational coordinates
for 64 missiles which he said had been planted worldwide so far...urged his
listeners to pressure the Joint Chiefs of Staff to take counteractive
measures...and in effect dared the government to prove him wrong. The
resulting hue and cry from Dr. Beter's listeners nationwide created shock
waves within the U.S. Government which were never reported by the major news
media.
In mid-September 1976, Dr. Beter and an associate met for over an hour with
General George S. Brown, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, in Gen.
Brown's Pentagon office. Only two weeks earlier, a letter over Gen. Brown's
signature had been sent to Dr. Beter (with photocopies to concerned citizens
nationwide), seeming to say that Dr. Beter's charges about Soviet underwater
missiles had been investigated and found untrue.
Yet when Dr. Beter then requested a meeting with
Gen. Brown to relay to him the locations of a second round of 48
newly-planted missiles, the meeting was granted without delay. The Pentagon
confirmed to the press that the meeting had taken place*,
but never explained this curious sequence of events.
* See,
e.g., Norfolk (Va.) Ledger-Star, Sept. 27, 1976, p. E8, article by G.
Bradshaw and J. Kestner. Or see Chicago Tribune, Dec. 4, 1977, Section 2,
"Special Report: Undersea Warfare."
Professional credentials:
The things made public by Dr. Beter are
extraordinary - but so is the professional background which preceded his
public visibility. He practiced general law in Washington, D.C., from 1951
to 1961, becoming a member of the U.S. Court of Military Appeals in 1952 and
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964. Many of his cases were against the federal
government, all of which he won - including one case in which he caught none
other than the U.S. Department of Justice burning records in an attempt to
defeat him.
The resulting decision - Farley vs. U.S., 131 C. Cls. 776 (1955),
127 F Supp. 562 - made new law.
In 1961 President John F. Kennedy appointed Dr. Beter Counsel to the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, the largest government-owned bank in the Western world,
where he served until 1967.
After leaving the Ex-Im Bank, Dr. Beter became
an international financial and legal consultant, as well as one of the chief
developers of private international business in the Republic of Zaire. He
was a member of the Judicature Society, the Bankers' Club of America, the
Royal Commonwealth Society of London, and the United States Naval Institute.
He is listed in biographical reference works
such as Who's Who in the East, the Blue Book of London, and 2000 Men of
Achievement (London).
A Bird's-Eye View of
the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER
Excerpted from the Dr. Beter AUDIO
LETTER REFERENCE DIGEST, Audio Books Inc., 1983
The 80 cassette tapes which make up the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER series
contain an enormous amount of information. It would take the equivalent of
two 40-hour work weeks just to listen to the entire 80-tape set once
through. In this "Bird's-Eye View" section, we will try to boil down the
broad insights of the 80-tape AUDIO LETTER report series as concisely as
possible.
We will keep details to a minimum, aside from
examples to illustrate particular points. Given the broad outlines of this
section, we believe that all the details in Section 2 and Section 3 - not to
mention in the tapes themselves - will be easier to grasp and far more
meaningful than they would be if viewed in isolation.
In the long term, it is this broader picture of the basic forces behind
current events which is the most important of all to understand. Even though
some of the developments discussed in the tapes have run their course, the
forces which brought them about continue to operate today.
Comprehending how those forces led to
yesterday's events is the key to seeing through countless new events today
and tomorrow.
Politics: The Three Rival Factions for World
Power
Decades ago Franklin D. Roosevelt said:
"Nothing in politics ever happens by
accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way."
Decades earlier Benjamin Disraeli, famed as the Victorian-era Prime Minister
of Britain, wrote:
"The world is governed by people far
different from those imagined by the public."
Taken together, these two statements illustrate
the basic premise which underlies all of the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER tape
reports. This premise is that major events in politics, economics and
international relations are the products of deliberate moves by largely
unseen power factions in the world. All of these factions seek to increase
their influence over us, the general population of the world. Each one also
wishes to increase its own power at the expense of the other power factions.
Thus there is an ongoing power struggle of titanic dimensions which
constantly shapes the news, yet which is little understood - indeed
unsuspected - by most people. If these forces are not recognized or
understood, current events are inherently baffling, no matter how diligently
one may follow the news.
This leaves even the best-educated and most
intelligent of persons vulnerable to manipulation to suit the purposes of
those who pull the strings behind the scenes. By contrast, if the largely
unseen forces are known and understood, major events become far more
understandable and even, to some extent, predictable.
Those informed about these things become far
less vulnerable and more difficult to fool by manipulated news and news
events.
To choose just one of the many dramatic examples from the AUDIO LETTER
series, consider the Guyana Massacre at Jonestown in November, 1978. From
start to finish, the Guyana story was filled with anomalies, unanswered
questions, conflicting government statements, and news reports that did not
quite add up. It began with the slaughter of a U.S. Congressman and
accompanying newsmen, yet there was never a subsequent congressional
investigation.
The victims died of cyanide poisoning, an
excruciating death which leaves the face contorted in agony, yet the victims
were found arranged in neat, peaceful-looking rows... face-down. A few days
after the massive infusion of American military teams supposedly for
clean-up operations, there were sudden huge jumps in body-bag counts.
Hurried explanations by Pentagon spokesmen were so incredible that they were
withdrawn and replaced by different stories.
These and many more oddities about the Guyana
episode were never resolved, but simply left to fade away from the public
memory with time. For those unaware of the behind-the-scenes forces at work
in the world, Guyana will remain forever unexplained...as if events so
bizarre, major and chilling can happen for no reason at all.
The key missing ingredient in all the news reports about Guyana was the
existence of a secret Soviet intermediate-range missile base, not far from
Jonestown. Dr. Beter had reported publicly about the base on many occasions
for over four years prior to the sudden headlines from Guyana. He had also
reported on the collapse of a cooperative arrangement formerly in effect
between the true rulers of the United States and those of the Soviet Union.
These were the factors which led directly to the
Jonestown tragedy - a mass murder, staged as a cover to enable covert
military action against the Russian missile base. Within days after the
Jonestown tragedies,
Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER #40 made public exactly what had
taken place and why. In that tape Dr. Beter answered in detail questions
which otherwise remain unanswered to this day.
Over the course of the 80 AUDIO LETTER tape reports, Dr. Beter reveals that
three primary power factions are at work in the world today:
-
The
Rockefeller Cartel
-
The
Bolshevik-Zionist Axis
-
The New Kremlin Rulers
These factions as such have existed for the past
century or so, and their relationships with one another have been in a
constant state of flux.
Their roots, however, are much older and can be
traced backward in time for many centuries.
The Rockefeller Cartel
The Rockefeller Cartel is the first of the three great power factions to be
dealt with extensively in the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER reports, for at least
two reasons.
-
First, while its scope is worldwide, it is headquartered in the
United States.
-
Second, it was indisputably the most powerful of the three
factions when Dr. Beter began recording his AUDIO LETTER reports in 1975.
This situation changed dramatically later on.
The Rockefeller Cartel today embraces several hundred of the world's largest
multinational corporations - big oil, big banking and big business. It is a
new kind of empire, with economic assets so great as to be beyond effective
control by mere governments. Its headquarters are American, but its
perspective is global, with allegiance neither to the United States nor to
any other country. It is an empire unto itself.
What is today the Rockefeller Cartel was started over a century ago by
John
D. Rockefeller, Sr. By his well-known cutthroat business tactics Rockefeller
created the Standard Oil trust and made himself America's first billionaire
by the turn of the century.
Such blatantly unethical practices led to public opposition which culminated
in the Supreme Court decree of 1911 dissolving the Standard Oil trust. By
then, however, Rockefeller was becoming more sophisticated, finding ways to
hide the true extent of his wealth and power while continuing to expand it.
The "trust-busting" era had little lasting effect: by the use of nominees
and other devices it was possible to retain effective control and
coordination of the superficially dismantled Standard Oil empire.
Throughout the Twentieth Century, from World War I onward, Rockefeller
economic power has translated increasingly into Rockefeller political power.
This, in turn, has been used to increase Rockefeller economic power still
further. For example, oil has played a key role in all of America's major
wars of this century, with the Rockefeller oil interests profiting
handsomely. Yet this role has been generally obscured both in current news
accounts during each war and in historical accounts written later on.
The obscuring of key information of this type is
a symptom of Rockefeller power expansion into the realms of journalism and
teaching. Power is always most secure when it is not recognized, so every
effort is made to keep information about it from becoming public.
In a related vein, Rockefeller-style "public relations" has been developed
and refined since the turn of the century for similarly deceptive purposes.
It began when John D. Rockefeller, Sr., famous primarily for his greed,
started changing his image by handing out dimes to people he chanced to meet
on the street.
At the same time he also began making donations
to charitable causes, always with great fanfare and publicity, to curry
public favor as an alleged philanthropist. This led to the creation of
tax-exempt foundations: these enabled Rockefeller money to be invested in
organizations which looked philanthropic, yet which were actually avenues
for further expanding Rockefeller power.
The Rockefeller-controlled major foundations
have been used to transform American life and values in directions which
make America more susceptible to Rockefeller control. At the same time, the
foundations serve an invaluable purpose as a disguised means for
interlocking the various business interests which constitute the Rockefeller
Cartel.
John D. Rockefeller, Sr., founded a true dynasty, passing on his plans and
programs to be carried on by succeeding generations. John D. Rockefeller,
Jr., carried forward the Rockefeller program of ever-expanding power with
particular emphasis upon subverting the Christian faith which, historically,
is the foundation of basic American ideals.
But it was the Rockefeller "Third Generation"
who expanded and developed the Rockefeller Cartel to its zenith of power. Of
the six members of the Third Generation, sister Abby and brother Winthrop
did not much care for the grand plan (although Winthrop did become Governor
of Arkansas). But the other four brothers - John D. 3rd, Nelson, Laurance and
David - threw themselves with crafty zest into the project of expanding the
Rockefeller empire.
They carved up the world into spheres of
influence, each concentrating upon his own areas but coordinating his
actions with the others. They worked together as a unit, and throughout his
AUDIO LETTER tapes Dr. Beter often refers to them simply as "the four
Rockefeller brothers."
From about World War II onward, it was the four Rockefeller brothers who
held the reins of what had become the worldwide Rockefeller Empire. It was
they who created the modern multinational corporation, and used American
taxpayer money under the guise of "foreign aid" after World War Il to build
up their corporate empire worldwide.
World War II had been fought over Saudi Arabian
oil, and it gave them an unprecedented financial windfall. The Rockefeller
oil companies obtained Saudi oil at a net cost (after charge-backs and
various devices) of about 5 cents per barrel for nearly 30 years, until the
Arab oil embargo of 1973 finally put a halt to it. The awesome profits
generated by Saudi Arabian oil enabled the Rockefeller brothers to buy up
much of the industrial base of the United States, Europe and Japan.
At the same time Rockefeller power throughout Latin America, which had been
established by Nelson Rockefeller during World War II, was expanded and
deepened during the postwar years. John D. Rockefeller, 3rd, masterminded
the Rockefeller Cartel economic takeover of much of black Africa:
revolutions created black governments which, lacking expertise, had to turn
to Rockefeller multinational corporations to "manage" their resources.
Laurance Rockefeller
busied himself with control
of America's aerospace and defense industry, major airlines, and massaging
the stock market. David, the youngest but most powerful, became the kingpin
of the Rockefeller banking empire whose tentacles reach into business
circles the world over. He also specialized in intelligence matters,
although Nelson also was involved in this area.
For decades the four Rockefeller brothers had things pretty much their own
way. They made plans, set up timetables, and generally carried them out
without a hitch. But by the time Dr. Beter launched his AUDIO LETTER tape
report series, the Rockefeller brothers were beginning to show signs of
slippage in their power. They had made mistakes, and some of their
timetables were starting to slide.
During 1974-75 they were tripped up in certain
plans by partial public exposure of massive irregularities surrounding
America's monetary gold supply. Next during 1976-77 their long-standing
secret alliance with the Kremlin fell apart, as their former allies - the
Bolsheviks - were overthrown by a new ruling group in Russia. The four
Rockefeller brothers made the mistake of welcoming expelled Bolsheviks from
Russia into positions of power here in the United States. This led by early
1979 to the overthrow of the four Rockefeller brothers by the Bolsheviks
here.
First John D. Rockefeller, 3rd, died in an
alleged auto "accident" in July 1978. Then in late January 1979, Nelson
Rockefeller was murdered in the beginning of a full-fledged Bolshevik coup
d'etat behind the scenes.
Today the Rockefeller Cartel is no longer under the direct control of the
Rockefeller family as it was under the four Rockefeller brothers, but it
remains a formidable force.
As Dr. Beter ended his AUDIO LETTER report
series in November 1982, the regrouped Rockefeller Cartel was gradually
regaining some of its lost power in a bitter struggle against the Bolsheviks
here.
The Bolshevik-Zionist Axis
In 1917, during the height of World War I, two events took place which were
destined to shape much of the history of the Twentieth Century. One was the
Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The other was the
Balfour Declaration, by
which the government of Britain threw its support behind the concept of
creating a Jewish homeland in Palestine.
Both Bolshevism and the political force known as Zionism have common roots
which are not widely known. Both were created by the
Rothschild
interests,
whose support was also responsible for the meteoric rise to riches of John
D. Rockefeller, Sr., a century ago. Bolshevism and Zionism also have common
historical roots in the so-called "Kingdom of the Jews" of a thousand years
ago.
This kingdom was situated in what is now
southern Russia, between the Black and Caspian Seas. It consisted of a
people known as
the Khazars of a Mongol-Turkic origin whose leader
officially adopted Judaism as the state religion. This was done as a
political ploy to enable Khazaria to maintain its political independence of
two powerful neighbors.
These were the super-powers of that day: the
Moslem empire of the Caliphs to the South and the Christian empire of
Byzantium to the west.
Prior to the official adoption of Judaism, the Khazars were a brutal and
warlike people.
This did not change when they took upon themselves the
politically inspired title of "Jews." The Khazar empire extended far
northward into what, under Christian Prince Vladimir, became known as
Russia. The Khazar empire even included the ancient Russian city of Kiev,
where Vladimir ruled.
Khazar rule was brutal and oppressive, without any of the compensating
advantages offered by other empires, such as protection against outside
powers or improved civilization. Finally the Christian forces of Prince
Vladimir's Russia and Byzantium combined to attack the Khazar "Kingdom of
the Jews", so-called, and utterly destroy it.
The Khazar "Jews" were driven out of their
homeland between the seas, many of them into eastern Europe. There they
mingled to some extent with Jews of the diaspora from Palestine, but they
carried with them a peculiar heritage. It was a heritage of bitter hatred
for Christianity in general and for Russian Christians in particular.
Down through the centuries, the "Khazar Jew" dream of regaining their lost
empire has been passed down from generation to generation. This dream has
developed into two branches. One branch emphasizes restoration of power over
Russia, and crystallized into Bolshevism.
The other branch, emphasizing the old, falsely
religious "Kingdom of the Jews" concept, emerged as the political force
known as Zionism. Both are aimed at world power. Both are equally ruthless,
devoid of regard for human life. They differ only in geographic emphasis and
in some tactics. With their common roots and common basic objectives, the
Bolsheviks and Zionists work together hand in glove.
When Bolshevism was injected into Christian Russia in 1917, it was done with
the help of the Rockefeller Cartel. From that time onward there was a covert
alliance between those who controlled American policies behind the scenes
(the Rockefeller Cartel) and those who ran the Soviet Union (the
Bolsheviks). The Rockefeller Standard Oil interests were given control over
marketing of the oil from the giant Russian Baku oil fields in 1926. Over
the years, the Rockefeller Cartel saw to it that the Bolshevik regime in
Russia was propped up in every way necessary to keep it in power.
While the United States and the Soviet Union pretended to be at odds, they
actually were involved in a pincers movement to gobble up the entire world.
The falsified animosity between Washington and Moscow was staged in order to
polarize the world and cause nations to form up into two camps dominated by
the two super-powers.
Those who chose to remain independent of both
the United States and the Soviet Union - the so-called "Third World"
- were
targeted for brushfire wars and revolutions to bring them to heel, one by
one. Meanwhile the long-term goal was - in the words of a secret White House
directive,
"to so alter life in the United States that it can be comfortably
merged with life in the Soviet Union."
In this way, an all-powerful
"one
world" government would ultimately be achieved.
That was to be the fulfillment of a "commitment"
established early in the Twentieth Century by the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace and allied foundations in the Rockefeller orbit.
In order to "merge" American life into the pattern of Soviet life under the
Bolsheviks, it was clear that the quality of American life would have to be
lowered a great deal. It required subtle movement of the American political
system in the direction of dictatorship. It required weakening of America's
financial and monetary system.
And to bring about the radical changes desired,
it meant wars with the United States carefully maneuvered into a losing
position. America's first no-win war was the Korean War. A decade later,
America became embroiled in the losing Vietnam War, which was artificially
dragged out with all possibilities for military victory vetoed by the White
House.
The final war was to be a carefully programmed "Nuclear War I", fought
primarily on American soil, between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Plans called for it to erupt in the late 1970's, but developments in Russia
changed that. The Bolsheviks who had run the Kremlin since 1917 were the
targets of a decades-long overthrow campaign by a tough sect of native
Russian Christians.
Their power had begun to outweigh that of the
Bolsheviks in certain areas starting in 1953, when Stalin died. This was the
reason for Nikita Khruschev's famous "de-Stalinization" campaign afterward.
In the mid-1970's this anti-Bolshevik sect finally reached such a level of
power that they completely overthrew and expelled the remaining Bolsheviks
in the Kremlin. There followed a heavy wave of expulsions of Bolsheviks from
positions of power in Russia, which was depicted in the Western press as
emigration.
As the Bolsheviks were losing their grip on Russia, so-called detente fell
on hard times. The Rockefeller-Soviet alliance had been based on Bolshevik
control on the Soviet side, and when that was terminated, so was the secret
alliance. The alliance was fractured by the still-secret Underwater Missile
Crisis of 1976; a year later it was broken completely by the equally secret
Battle of The Harvest Moon in space.
At that point the four Rockefeller brothers made a fatal mistake. Since
their former secret allies in the Soviet Union had been the Bolsheviks, they
welcomed the expelled Bolsheviks from Russia into positions of power here in
the United States. They reasoned that the expelled Bolsheviks would know the
weak spots of the upstart new group who had taken over the Kremlin and could
help the Rockefeller Cartel deal with them.
What the Rockefeller brothers forgot is that the Bolsheviks are incapable of
sharing power with anyone. Worse yet, the Bolsheviks are state socialists,
who seek to concentrate all power into the hands of a few (themselves) by
way of government. The Rockefeller Cartel, by contrast, represents corporate
socialism - the concentration of power into the hands of a few by way of
corporations, with minimum governmental interference.
Both seek the same goal, but by means which are
diametrically opposed. They cannot coexist within the same society.
The Bolsheviks no sooner acquired positions of power here in the United
States than they began using it to topple the four Rockefeller brothers. By
mid-1978, Bolshevik influence within the Pentagon was causing a radical
shift of American strategic policy onto a first-strike nuclear posture.
Meanwhile in July 1978, the death of John D. Rockefeller, 3rd, took place,
weakening what had been the four-brother unit. In November 1978 the Guyana
Massacre took place, as part of a military operation masterminded by the
Pentagon Bolsheviks and with crucial participation by Israeli commandoes.
Then in January 1979, the all-out Bolshevik grab
for power began with the murder of Nelson Rockefeller.
During the first few months of 1979, Rockefeller power over the United
States Government was shattered by the Bolsheviks here. However, the
Bolsheviks were stopped short of complete success in their takeover bid by
the intervention of Russia's KGB. The new Kremlin rulers knew that a
complete takeover by the Bolsheviks here would lead quickly to nuclear war,
and they acted to prevent it. Even so, Bolshevik control over the Pentagon
has been strong ever since early 1979, onward through the end of the AUDIO
LETTER series in late 1982.
A fierce power struggle is underway within the United States Government
between the now entrenched Bolsheviks and the Rockefeller Cartel, which is
trying to take back its former power. In addition, a limited new quid pro
quo against the Bolsheviks was established by the Rockefeller Cartel and the
New Kremlin early in 1982. The Cartel and the Kremlin still have some
accounts to settle with each other, but both are deadly enemies of the
Bolsheviks. To destroy them, they have agreed to work together in certain
ways.
The Bolsheviks here in the United States have as a major goal a deliberate
nuclear war by which to smash the Russia which overthrew them. As an avenue
toward that war, the Middle East is critical. In that area, the Bolsheviks
here are relying upon their close allies, the Zionists, to pave the way for
war.
Just as most Americans are unaware of the Bolshevized nature of their
government, most Israeli citizens are unaware of the true goals of their
Zionist government. Americans and Israelis alike scratch their heads with
worry and puzzlement over actions of their respective governments. While
constantly talking peace, both are systematically increasing the dangers of
war.
The radical Zionist regime in power in Israel from 1977 onward is headed by
men who were terrorists in the 1940's. Today, as heads of the world's third
most powerful military power, they continue to practice terrorism but on a
grander scale. Theirs is a doctrine of military terrorism, designed to lead
deliberately to new and wider conflicts as the map of Israel grows steadily.
The country which calls itself "Israel" today
bears little resemblance to the promises of the small but vocal Zionist
minority who brought about the
Balfour Declaration in 1917. The peaceful,
tranquil haven for oppressed Jews does not exist.
Instead, the dire warnings published in 1919 by
a galaxy of prominent anti-Zionist American Jews have been fulfilled in the
bloody history of Zionist Israel.
The New Kremlin Rulers
Dr. Beter first revealed in late 1977 that a new, non-Bolshevik ruling group
had taken the reins of top power in the Soviet Union. In the autumn of 1978,
he devoted a complete
AUDIO LETTER tape (#38) to a special report on Russia
and her new rulers.
To those who depend upon pronouncements of the United States Government for
their image of Russia, Dr. Beter's reports about the New Kremlin tend to
come as a distinct shock. Unlike the atheistic Bolsheviks recently
overthrown, Russia's new top rulers are members of a sect of native Russian
Christians. This sect is at least two centuries old, and at times had
considerable influence with the Czars.
Dr. Beter cautions his listeners not to assume that the New Kremlin rulers
look at everything in the same way as Western Christians might. For one
thing, he points out that it required a patient, arduous campaign of six
decades for them to oust the Bolsheviks from top power in Russia. That
experience has left them with very definite, vivid opinions about what does
and does not work when dealing with people like the Bolsheviks and Zionists.
They also know that rapid, radical change of any
type opens the door for revolution - and where there is revolution,
Bolshevik-Zionist agents will be there to exploit it. They are introducing
liberalizing changes in Russia gradually, one step at a time. Having come
this far, they are trying not to move too fast and thereby risk allowing it
all to be undone.
Even so, visible changes are occurring. Early in 1979 the first legal
shipment of Bibles into Russia since the Bolshevik Revolution took place.
That Easter, Handel's Messiah was performed in Russia for the first time
since the Bolshevik Revolution - and not in some out-of-the-way place, but at
the Moscow Conservatory. Churches are reopening, one by one, all over the
Soviet Union - and they are packed, as Dr. Billy Graham told the world upon
returning from a Moscow religious conference in May 1982.
For saying what he did about what he had seen of religion in Russia, Dr.
Graham ran into a hostile reception here in the United States. The
Bolsheviks who now dominate the United States Government are doing
everything in their power to paint Russia as an enemy worthy of hate.
Anything which interferes with that image is suppressed.
Because someday, the Bolsheviks here want
America to go to war against Russia.
Economics - Manmade Causes of Worldwide Economic
Disaster
Centuries ago Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the
Rothschild Dynasty,
said:
"Give me the power to issue a nation's money, and I care not who
writes the laws."
Money is a necessary ingredient in the advancement of civilization itself.
As a store of value and a medium of exchange, money is vastly more
convenient and flexible than any system of barter, which is the only
alternative. Money facilitates division of labor, specialization by
individuals according to their talents, and organization of human activity
into complex patterns necessary for advancement in virtually all realms of
endeavor.
It even helps to make possible economies of
scale and other efficiencies which raise human productivity far beyond the
levels required for mere survival. This makes it possible for a society to
support artistic and other cultural advancements by which a civilization
becomes more refined and rich.
In short, money is the economic glue which holds a society together. If it
is honest, stable and unmanipulated, money plays a neutral role which is
equally beneficial to all members of society. By working hard, for example,
a person may earn more than is needed immediately to pay for whatever he
buys from others. The excess can be saved, then spent whenever desired to
meet an extraordinary expense, buy something special, or retire from work
and live off the fruits of past labor.
Money earned reflects work which is valued by
society and for which one is paid.
It is this role of money as the economic common denominator of society that
makes it such a tool of immense power in the wrong hands. He who issues a
nation's money can create out of thin air what all the rest of us have to
earn by honest labor.
The issuer of money thus acquires unparalleled
power over other individuals, since at the stroke of a pen he can make
others wealthy who cooperate in advancing his fraudulent schemes. In any
society there are always more than enough individuals available who are
eager to be comfortably corrupted in this way, and it is they who are helped
into positions of governmental power.
That is what Rothschild meant when he said,
"I care not who writes the laws."
The power to issue money is the power to shape
government to one's own ends.
If one has the power to issue a nation's money, then he also has the power
to change its value. This changes the yardstick by which every single
economic transaction in a society is measured, and is a way to steal from an
entire society at once. He who sets aside the excess fruits of his labor in
the form of money is robbed if, when he is ready to use it later, it is no
longer worth the same amount.
That is happening today in the United States, of
course; it is called inflation.
By the time of the American Revolution, Rothschild financial power in
Europe, and especially in Britain, was great. The Stamp Tax and other
oppressive measures which helped trigger the Revolution bore the signature
of King George, but they originated in the House of Rothschild. The
Revolution broke the former colonies free of Rothschild money control.
The framers of the United States Constitution well understood the evils of
corrupt, privately issued money. Therefore they refused to countenance the
creation of any type of privately owned central bank. Instead, they gave the
United States Congress the constitutional duty to issue and regulate the
nation's money. The theory was that since Congress represents all the
people, congressional control of our money should be the fairest and most
equitable system possible.
From then until the early Twentieth Century, there were repeated attempts by
the Rothschild interests to re-establish their lost money power here, either
directly or indirectly. One example was the Bank of the United States, whose
charter was cancelled by President Andrew Jackson in 1832. Likewise the
Civil War involved, not just questions of slavery and states' rights, but
also a strong component of struggle over the issuance of money.
But once again the attempt failed, thanks partly
to intervention by the Russian Navy at a critical tide in the war to prevent
Britain and France from dismembering the war-torn United States.
For doing that, Russia was slated for destruction by the Rothschild
interests. It was also decided that the best way to regain control over
America's money was from within. To that end the Rothschilds lent support to
several promising groups within the United States, spawning the era of the
"robber barons." Out of that group, the Rockefellers soon rose to the top.
In 1913 the Rothschilds finally saw the creation of what they had sought
here in the United States: a privately owned central banking system, called
the Federal Reserve System. It was a joint venture involving very heavy
participation - in fact a lead role - by the increasingly powerful Rockefeller
interests.
But at least the Rothschilds at last had their
foot back in the door for control of America's currency. In 1917 the
Rothschilds accomplished their other goal, the destruction of Christian
Russia, by way of the Bolshevik Revolution. As in the case of the Federal
Reserve System, the basic concept was Rothschild-inspired... but it was
Rockefeller muscle that made the plan a success. Having started out as
Rothschild protégés,
the Rockefeller Cartel had risen already to the status
of partners.
And during the decades that followed - especially
after World War II - the Rockefellers pulled ahead and eclipsed Rothschild
power on the world stage. That situation continued until the end of the
1970's. Now, with the collapse of the family Rockefeller Dynasty, the
balance between the Rockefeller and Rothschild factions is in a state of
flux, with both struggling for renewed supremacy.
The
Federal Reserve System
was sold to the public as a prescription for
improved economic stability. But the record shows that the stock market
crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression were brought about in large
part by deliberate Federal Reserve actions. The Great Bull Market of the
1920's was set in motion and sustained for most of a decade by means of easy
credit. By 1929 the towering stock market was resting upon a huge, wobbly
foundation of credit - that is, debt.
The Federal Reserve Board then destroyed that
foundation over a matter of mere months by severely contracting credit. The
excuse given was designed to sound good, namely a crackdown on harmful
speculation. But the real and predictable effect was to cause masses of
investors to be suddenly unable to cover their "margin" stock-market
purchases, forcing them to sell stock to raise cash.
The sell-off thus triggered fed upon itself,
while the Federal Reserve Board did nothing to halt the plunge. The stock
market crashed.
Having set economic disaster in motion, the Federal Reserve Board soon
thereafter made sure that it would mushroom into an all-out depression. This
was brought about, not by the stock market crash itself, but by the failure
of the American banking system afterward. A key purpose of the Federal
Reserve System is supposed to be the preservation of banking stability, by
stepping in as the lender of last resort (among other things) to prevent a
localized banking problem from spreading.
But in the early 1930's, a then-major bank - the
United States Bank of New York - collapsed while the Federal Reserve System
steadfastly refused to lift a finger to stop it. This created a chain
reaction which pulled down additional banks, which dragged down still
others, and so on. The Federal Reserve System, far from stopping this
process, had set it in motion and did not intervene as it progressed.
This plunged America and then the entire world
into the Great Depression of the 1930's.
To most people a depression is an unmitigated disaster. It is hard to
imagine that anyone could benefit from it, much less bring it about
deliberately. But for the money controllers and their wealthy allies, the
Great Depression provided enormous opportunities for increased wealth and
power. Knowing what was coming, they were able to avoid the crushing
financial losses which befell everyone else.
Then during the depths of the Depression, they
were in a position to buy up companies, real estate and other assets at a
penny on the dollar. When the economy revived later on, these assets
regained their value, producing vast profits for their new owners.
Ironically, by using their money control to plunge the American economy into
disaster, the moneychangers set the stage for still greater expansion of
their authority over America's monetary system. When President Franklin D.
Roosevelt took office in 1933, he launched a series of sweeping moves that
began with the declaration of a bank holiday.
The United States was taken off the gold
standard. Americans were required to turn in all of their gold coins. Title
to America's gold was then handed over - as a gift! - to the Federal Reserve
System. However, the Federal Reserve System was relieved of any need to
spend time and money to take care of the gold which it now owned, as the
U.S. Treasury Department was made physical custodian of the gold.
The Federal Reserve System became freer than ever to tinker with America's
economy by printing paper and controlling credit. The freedom grew steadily
over the years as gold backing for the dollar was decreased. In 1968
President Johnson signed into law an act removing the final 25% gold backing
requirement from the dollar. In 1971 President Nixon closed the
international gold window, discontinuing settlement of international debts
in gold. This left the United States dollar purely a piece of paper, totally
divorced from gold or anything else of intrinsic value.
This is an ideal situation for the money
controllers, made to order for manipulation to enrich themselves at everyone
else's expense. Since the dollar has been a worldwide reserve currency since
1944, this means that everyone on earth is victimized by the dollar
manipulation now underway in the U.S.
From 1971 onward, inflation has been an ever-increasing problem in the
United States and therefore worldwide. Each time it is damped down
temporarily, it is slowed at the expense of rising unemployment and slumping
economic activity. When the economy revives, inflation soon takes off again
to new and higher levels. The Federal Reserve Board, claiming (as in 1929)
to be looking out for our best interests, responds with crushing new
interest rates that reach new historical highs. Again unemployment shoots
up, without ever having quite recovered from the previous cycle.
Cycle after cycle, inflation and economic
stagnation both keep getting worse. The balance between the two conditions
keeps shifting back and forth, but both inflation and stagnation are with us
continually and simultaneously. We are caught in the "stagflation" era
foreseen by Dr. Beter in his 1973 book, The Conspiracy Against the Dollar.
The crumbling of the once powerful United States economy is a direct
consequence, and an intended one, of the destruction of the dollar itself
which is underway. The time will come when the dollar will collapse
altogether, and with it the economy of the United States and much of the
world as we know it. At that point the same thing will have to be done that
has always been done when other currencies have collapsed. There will have
to be a new currency - a new dollar - with something behind it to restore
confidence. The one commodity which has been a reliable, universally
accepted basis for monetary confidence for thousands of years is gold.
And so, gold will have to be used in setting up
a new system of stable international currencies, including a new dollar.
Meanwhile there will come a period of international monetary turbulence
during which only gold or strongly gold-backed currencies will be trusted.
During that period of time, assets measured in dollars will shrivel - as they
are already doing now, at a less frantic pace. Those who have cornered the
world's gold supply will be in a perfect position to vastly expand their own
holdings and power.
And so, contrary to the official books of the
U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve System, America's monetary
gold hoard has been largely spirited away. It began in 1961 under the
London Gold Pool Agreement: for seven years enormous loads of American monetary
gold were hemorrhaged out of Fort Knox and other depositories and sent
overseas. In addition there have been secret shipments of gold which are not
reflected in official records at all.
Through their control and manipulation of money - specifically the United
States dollar - the moneychangers are stealing vast amounts of what countless
millions have worked hard to produce.
And just as they did in 1929 and afterward, they
are again positioning themselves to set off economic disaster worldwide.
Military - The Secret Plans and Weapons for
Armageddon
To most people war is a supreme evil among human events, to be avoided if at
all possible... and yet, we go right on having wars. To those who rule
nations, war is a tool of power which is used deliberately. War can be used
for external reasons, such as to increase the geographical extent of a
nation's power. More importantly, war provides the perfect excuse for a
government to impose increased controls on its own people.
By citing
"national security" the government can persuade the people that even
highly
dictatorial controls are for their own good.
These principles are among those laid out centuries ago by Machiavelli, who
recommended to all rulers that they use wars regularly as a tool of power.
But early in the Twentieth Century, the Carnegie, Rockefeller and allied
interests of the day dreamed of a world in which their power would be
absolute, and permanently assured. It would be a world at "peace"
- the peace
of a world inescapably within their grip. They formed a "commitment" to
establish an eventual "one world" government.
A leading institution which was created to coordinate this one-world
"commitment" was a tax-exempt foundation: the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. In order to bring about the envisioned "peace" of a
one-world government, it was clear that vast changes would have to be
wrought in the lives of Americans, as well as of the other peoples of the
world.
Several years before World War I the trustees spent an entire year
debating the question:
"Is there any means known to man that is more
effective than war in changing the life of an entire nation?"
They concluded
that the answer was:
"No."
And so, to start bringing about the changes needed under the
long-range
commitment for a one-world government, somehow America had to be gotten into
war. The trustees debated how this could be done and concluded that it would
be necessary to control the foreign policy machinery of the United States.
That implied, in turn, that control had to be established over the State
Department.
Within a few years the fruits of these deliberations began to be seen in
U.S. actions. President Woodrow Wilson won re-election in 1916 on the theme,
"He kept us out of war", and then promptly took the United States into World
War I. On at least one occasion the trustees of the Carnegie Endowment sent
a telegram to Wilson urging him not to let American involvement in the war
end too soon. The changes in American life which they desired were beginning
to take place.
World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War all were orchestrated in
ways designed to serve the purposes of the long-range one-world commitment.
But during the decades beginning with World War II, a factor unforeseen by
the initiators of the one-world commitment grew steadily in importance. This
factor was the ever-accelerating advancement of weapons technology. Starting
with the atomic bomb, weaponry has advanced in ways not dreamed of in the
early years of the Twentieth Century. And these new technological
capabilities have played a role in the progressive collapse of the one-world
commitment as originally envisioned.
In 1960 American scientists invented the laser - a device which produces an
intense, narrow beam of light. Early lasers were crude and not very
powerful, yet it was clear from theoretical studies that someday laser beam
weapons would be possible. Other types of beam weapons were also foreseen
which were potentially even more devastating than lasers.
Suddenly there was a fatal flaw in the "one world" commitment. The flaw was
that it envisioned only one world - the Earth - as the entire arena of human
activity. That was beginning to change... because mankind was beginning the
conquest of space.
In 1957, three years before the invention of the
laser, the world's first manmade earth satellite had been orbited by the
Soviet Union - Sputnik I. The honor of being the first nation in history to
do this had been handed to the Soviet Union, even though the United States
had been technically capable of doing it first. The Soviet space program was
far ahead of that of the United States when, in 1960, the invention of the
laser suddenly added an urgent new dimension to the space race.
The beam from a laser or other beam weapon can
travel through space at the speed of light to strike a target a million
miles away within a matter of seconds.
Suddenly
the Moon had become a prize
piece of military real estate: whoever controlled the moon could someday use
it as a base for beam weapons to control the Earth.
In 1961 the four Rockefeller brothers inaugurated an elaborate, two-pronged
program for world domination, with seizure of the moon as its centerpiece.
On one hand, the United States would embark on a program of supposed
disarmament, whittling back the power of America's visible military forces.
But on the other hand, there would be increased emphasis upon development of
advanced new secret weapons, unknown to the public and largely unknown even
to Congress.
And under the guise of a great adventure, the moon would be
seized for unadmitted military purposes by way of
the Apollo Project.
The four Rockefeller brothers had in mind an eventual double-cross of their
secret ally, the Soviet Union, in the programmed nuclear war to come. By
seizing control of the moon and installing devastating beam weapons there,
they expected to emerge as the final, absolute rulers of the entire world.
In May 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced that the United States
would land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth before the end
of the decade. Thus began a crash program ten times bigger than the
Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. It was too
big to hide, so instead its military nature was disguised by a constant
glare of publicity to portray it all as a lark to pick up some moon rocks.
And it succeeded.
When Neil Armstrong planted man's first footprints on the moon in July 1969,
it was a sensational event the world over. Little more than three years
later, however, it was becoming routine enough in the public eye for
America's manned moon program to be removed from public view. The final
publicly admitted
moon flight was
Apollo 17 in December 1972.
Thereafter, as the American public became
increasingly absorbed in the Watergate Scandal and other matters, the U.S.
moon program continued secretly from a new base:
the island of Diego Garcia
in the Indian Ocean.
Different launch techniques were used there, involving
the Skylab space station as a way station to the moon.
While all of this was going on, unexpected developments were brewing in the
Soviet Union: a progressive overthrow of the Bolsheviks was steadily
accelerating. By the mid-1960's the emerging new Kremlin rulers had learned
about the planned Rockefeller double-cross in a programmed nuclear war to
come. They redoubled their efforts to complete their overthrow of the
Bolsheviks.
They also began preparing to beat the
Rockefeller brothers to the punch with their own double-cross.
By the mid-1970's, present-day trustees of the major Rockefeller tax-exempt
foundations were growing increasingly worried. Signs were multiplying that
the one-world commitment formed two generations earlier had jumped the
tracks. They were right.
In the summer of 1976 Dr. Beter reported on a major crisis which, to this
day, has never been made public officially. This was the Underwater Missile
Crisis, in which the Soviet Navy was planting small underwater-launch,
short-range missiles with nuclear warheads inside American territorial
waters. These were planted close to their targets, able to be fired at a
moment's notice by satellite command.
If fired, they would destroy coastal target
areas with essentially zero warning time - the perfect "first strike." They
were planted by means of small sonar-absorbing, super-quiet mini-submarines,
designed to move in and out of American territorial waters without being
detected by coastal sonar defense nets.
The limited exposure of this crisis by way of the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER
reports enabled the late General George S. Brown, then Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, to take action. Over protests by then-Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger, General Brown persuaded then-President Gerald Ford to give
him the go-ahead to order the U.S. Navy to remove the missiles.
In September 1976 Dr. Beter and an associate met
with General Brown in his Pentagon office to discuss the crisis. In that
meeting, Dr. Beter provided General Brown with the locations of a second
round of Soviet underwater missiles. This was information General Brown did
not have, thanks to an "intelligence gap" created by Kissinger in context
with the former Rockefeller-Soviet alliance.
Exposure of the Soviet missile-planting program took away the crucial
element of surprise and helped to avert war at that time. Even so, General
Brown was soon neutralized as part of a hopeless Rockefeller attempt to
restore the former Rockefeller-Soviet alliance, and many Soviet missiles
were never removed from American waters.
As the immediate crisis over the Soviet underwater missiles died down, Dr.
Beter learned that other missiles also were planted under the sea. These had
been planted earlier and were not Soviet, but American. In violation of
international treaties, the United States had planted mammoth multi-warhead
missiles on the ocean floor in the Atlantic and Pacific, targeted on the
Soviet Union.
The new Kremlin rulers bided their time, allowing the four Rockefeller
brothers to convince themselves that they were succeeding in patching up the
former alliance. But they were routing the Bolsheviks out of the Kremlin and
out of many other high-level positions of power in Russia. At the same time
they were finalizing preparations for a surprise many times more decisive
than that of the Underwater Missile Crisis.
As the autumn of 1977 approached, American beam weapons were nearing
operational status at a secret military base nestled in Copernicus Crater on
the moon (click image left). But on the night of the Harvest Moon, September 27, 1977, the base
was attacked and put out of action by the Soviet Union.
For ten years the Russians had been involved in
a crash program to develop a family of particle beam weapons, which fire
subatomic particles at a target at virtually the speed of light.
A neutron
beam weapon, fired from an orbiting, manned satellite, killed all the
astronauts at the American
moon base.
(The Russian satellite was partially disabled
during the encounter. This was the nuclear-powered satellite, Cosmos 954,
which four months later created a worldwide sensation by coming to earth in
northern Canada. It was not a crash, but an emergency landing.)
The silencing of the secret U.S. moon base was the beginning of a lightning
military takeover of space by the Soviet Union. During the final months of
1977, the Soviet Union deployed a "space triad" of manned strategic weapons,
to which the United States has no counterpart. First came the "cosmos
interceptor" killer satellites, which use particle beam weapons to blast
other satellites out of existence.
These started hunting down and destroying
American spy and early-warning satellites, one by one. Within about six
months - by the spring of 1978 - they completed the job. Meanwhile Russia's
new rulers were demanding that the United States begin laying down its arms
by way of SALT II or risk unspecified dire consequences.
These circumstances
led to a desperate intelligence mission in April 1978, in which a Korean
airliner flew into the most sensitive military airspace in the Soviet Union.
Russian jet fighters forced the airliner down, but only after special
equipment mounted in the plane radioed vital data on the Soviet military
alert status to CIA receivers.
In addition to spy satellites, a Russian cosmos interceptor also destroyed
the Skylab space station in mid-October, 1977, in order to block any
American attempt to return to the moon. Skylab died in a giant fireball seen
over much of the United States on October 18, 1977. NASA waited a week or so
for all the puzzled questions over the mystery giant fireball to die away
and then began
a lengthy coverup project, saying Skylab was sinking
unexpectedly from orbit. This hoax was followed from start to finish in the
Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER report series.
The second leg of the Russian space triad was deployed and initially tested
during October and November of 1977. It is a network of high-power particle
beam weapons on the moon, aimed at Earth. The first test of these in
November 1977 was carried out under cover of a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal.
The beam weapons produced a gigantic double flash.
Due apparently to an aiming error in this first
test shot, they also created a huge tidal wave which came racing out of the
cyclone without warning to inundate large areas of the southeastern Indian
coastline. Since that time, the lunar beam weapons have been fired only at
target areas well out to sea, for weather modification purposes.
Dr. Beter first reported on the characteristic brilliant double flash
produced by the Russian lunar beam weapons in late 1977. Nearly two years
later, an aging American Vela satellite happened to detect one of these
double flash episodes in the South Atlantic. This led to dramatic rumors for
awhile that Israel had tested an atomic bomb in that area with the help of
South Africa, since nuclear weapons produce a somewhat similar double flash.
But nuclear weapons also produce several
additional kinds of radiation along with the double flash, none of which
were present in the South Atlantic episode. What the satellite accidentally
detected was a test of a new technique for generating artificial storms,
which Dr. Beter described in detail in February 1980. Since then such
artificial storms have been used repeatedly as a weapon of weather warfare.
The third leg of the Russian "space triad" is a fleet of electrogravitic
hovering platforms called "cosmospheres." These could have been developed by
the United States, and in the early 1960's the late General Thomas Power
(then commander of the Strategic Air Command) and others urged that this be
done. But instead, all of America's secret space eggs were put into the
basket of the
Project Apollo moon program.
Meanwhile the Soviet Union went ahead with
development of these platforms, and in December 1977 their operational
deployment began. For several months they announced their presence in
hair-raising fashion along the U.S. East Coast and elsewhere by creating
mysterious giant air booms. They did this by firing their powerful charged
particle beam weapons into the atmosphere in a de-focused mode, in effect
causing the air itself to explode.
The air booms were an attempt at intimidation of
the U.S. Government, but did not accomplish much in that regard. After a few
months, the air booms were halted.
Today Russian cosmospheres routinely patrol high above all kinds of American
strategic targets. They stand guard especially over American ICBM bases,
ready to use their beam weapons to blast the missiles at the moment of
launch in the event of war.
The strategic weapons programs of the United States today are designed,
first and foremost, to try to counter the secret "space triad" weapons of
the Soviet Union. These weapons have yet to be made public by Russia's new
rulers, who are well aware that it would precipitate a propaganda disaster
for them if they did so. Likewise, America's rulers dare not publicly admit
the existence of these weapons which Russia has but America does not.
They are afraid that the American public would
react with everything from panic, to anger over America's "space gap", to
rage at having been lied to up to now. Congress too, having been largely
manipulated and kept uninformed, could become unruly in the extreme.
And so, while crash secret weapons programs have been underway in the United
States since early 1978, they are kept hidden or their true nature is
disguised. A wide range of weapons are involved, from high-power laser
weapons with new infrared targeting, to retrofitting of Titan II ICBM's for
fractional orbital bombardment with super-yield "doomsday" cobalt-bomb
warheads.
It is not practical to review all of these developments reported by Dr.
Beter in this "Bird's-Eye View" section. Instead, the basic situation can be
illustrated by considering just two weapons programs: the MX missile and the
"stealth" aircraft program. The official justifications for these programs
are always couched in terms of Russian weapons which everyone knows
about - primarily Russia's large missiles.
These explanations never quite add up, because
they are not the truth. As a result controversy and questions keep swirling
around these programs. As old rationales fray and fall apart, new ones are
devised which also don't quite add up. Only when the truth about Russia's
"space triad" is known do the American weapons programs make sense. Not
pleasant sense, but sense.
In June, 1980, Dr. Beter described in detail what
the MX program is all
about. The big MX missile itself is actually of little importance - but the MX program is being used as an umbrella under which another, completely
secret, missile system is being financed and deployed. Dr. Beter reported
that the controversy then raging over proposals for a "racetrack" mobile
basing system for the MX was only a lightning rod to draw attention away
from deployment of America's real mobile missile.
This is a much smaller missile, called the
Minuteman TX. It was developed virtually from off-the-shelf hardware, and is
deployed on America's railroads aboard special rail cars. Dr. Beter
described these unique rail cars, and later several listeners spotted them
and took photographs which were published in a special bulletin for AUDIO
LETTER listeners.
In October, 1981, President Reagan shocked a lot of people by announcing
that the MX missile would not be made mobile after all. The ridiculous
"racetrack" scheme had served its purpose, which was deception, and was
dropped. The controversy has continued, but the MX program has remained
alive through it all. Early in 1983, after the termination of the AUDIO
LETTER report series, the concept of a smaller mobile missile was the key
new ingredient in the public recommendations of the Scowcroft Commission on
strategic nuclear forces.
Supposedly such a small mobile missile,
nicknamed "Midgetman", could not be deployed until the early 1990's. But in
actuality, that type of missile is deployed already...the Minuteman TX. Its
biggest advantage has nothing to do with the alleged first-strike threat of
Russian ICBM's. Instead, the deployment of large numbers of small Minuteman
TX missiles is intended to make it impossible for Russia's cosmosphere fleet
to keep tabs on them all.
And as Dr. Beter detailed over the course of
several AUDIO LETTER reports, the mobile fleet of Minuteman TX missiles are
not designed merely to survive a Soviet nuclear first strike. Instead, the
Pentagon Bolsheviks intend to use them as the key to an eventual U.S. first
strike against Russia.
The other example to consider is the "stealth" program. This is a
multi-faceted program, which actually involves not only aircraft but also a
highly secret category of naval warships with their own special bases.
Shortly after Dr. Beter reported on the existence of these special bases in
the spring of 1982, they spawned naval warfare in the Southern Hemisphere.
The visible portion of that conflict was the
Falklands War.
Restricting attention to the stealth aircraft program, the most radical and
promising development is that of the "phantom warplane." First revealed by
Dr. Beter in the spring of 1982, the phantom warplane is as radical an
advance in this computer age as the atomic bomb was in an age of adding
machines and slide rules. By using powerful computer techniques, Einstein's
semi-finished Unified Field Theory has been used to design superconducting
electromagnetic field equipment which can bend light waves. Built into an
aircraft, this equipment creates a zone around the aircraft which light
cannot penetrate: instead, it flows around and onward, like water around a
boulder in a stream. The result is that at a distance the airplane is
invisible, not only to radar, but even to the eye.
Public comments about the stealth program refer only to radar evasion, not
to the far more startling capability of optical invisibility. Once again,
this is done in order to limit discussion to a range of weaponry
capabilities which will not raise too many public eyebrows. If the full
capabilities of the phantom warplane were known, it would raise the
question: why is something so radical needed?
The answer lies with Russia's still-secret beam weapons. The most important
fact about the invisibility field of a phantom warplane is not the
invisibility itself, but the protection which the same field provides
against all types of beam weapons.
The Bolsheviks who now control the United States Pentagon want to use all
these weapons to crush the Soviet Union from which they have been overthrown
and expelled. They have devised elaborate plans, detailed in the Dr. Beter
AUDIO LETTER reports, to set off a nuclear first strike by the United States
against Russia. Nuclear "false alarms", so-called, have been staged in order
to test their ability to trigger what will look afterward like accidental
nuclear war. American nuclear forces will be led to believe that they are
retaliating, instead of striking first.
The United States remains locked out of any large-scale, sustained military
presence in space. Even so, a few key reconnaissance and other military
tasks must be carried out in space in order to prepare for war. For that
purpose
the Space Shuttle is being used in ways hidden from public view. The
NASA Space Shuttle program is nominally civilian, but after the first Space
Shuttle launch the civilian director of the program was eased out.
Today the
Shuttle director is Air Force General James Abrahamson.
It is often said that the world today lives under the threat of a Battle of
Armageddon which, for the first time in history, could conceivably live up
its apocalyptic description in the Bible. What is less well known is that
certain evil forces are actively planning for such a conflict and trying to
bring it about.
And they are harnessing the ingenuity of man to
create Armageddon-style weapons about which the public is never informed.
Summary
In surveying the 80 cassette tapes of
the AUDIO LETTER report series, a
single gigantic picture emerges.
The most striking thing about this picture
is that countless seemingly unrelated, chaotic-appearing news events turn
out not to be chaotic after all. Instead they are all tied together by a
limited number of forces at work behind the scenes. Once one knows these
forces, one becomes far better able to sort out the true meaning of events.
Three major power groups are struggling today for worldwide influence and
power. Like icebergs, they are partially visible but mostly hidden.
These
groups are:
-
the Rockefeller Cartel of big oil, big banking and big business
-
the Bolshevik-Zionist Axis
-
the New Kremlin rulers of Russia
The relationships among these groups have shifted radically over the past
decade or so. The Bolsheviks used to control the Soviet Union, and while
they did there was a secret alliance between them and
the Rockefeller
Cartel. But they have been overthrown and expelled from top levels of power
in Russia by the New Kremlin rulers, who are anti-Bolshevik and are, in
fact, a secret sect of native Russian Christians.
During 1976 and 1977 Russia's new rulers
unilaterally terminated the long-time Rockefeller-Soviet alliance, together
with its plans for programmed nuclear war on the way to a "one world"
government. The four Rockefeller brothers, then in control of the
Rockefeller Cartel, welcomed the expelled Bolsheviks from Russia into
positions of power here in the United States.
That was a fatal mistake, which led to the
overthrow of the four Rockefeller brothers at Bolshevik hands from mid-1978
to early 1979. Since that time there has been a steadily intensifying power
struggle between the Bolsheviks here and the regrouped Rockefeller Cartel
for control over the U.S. Government. Generally speaking, the Bolsheviks
have been getting their way in military affairs, while the Rockefeller
Cartel has greater power in the economic realm.
Since early 1982, there has been a limited quid
pro quo between the Rockefeller Cartel and the New Kremlin against their
common bitter enemy, the Bolsheviks. Meanwhile the strong links between the
American Bolsheviks and the Zionist rulers of Israel have been forged into a
secret joint military junta - the Bolshevik-Zionist Axis - bent on war.
Politics, economics, and international relations (including war) are
constantly used by these world power factions as they struggle with one
another. Economic manipulations, covert intelligence maneuvers and a
proliferating array of secret weapons are features of this struggle. But as
made clear in many of Dr. Beter's tapes, the basic struggle is a spiritual
one.
Dr. Beter terminated his AUDIO LETTER report series in November 1982 due to
declining health.
Events which have taken place since then are beyond the
scope of this REFERENCE DIGEST. Even so, peppered throughout the tapes are
many discussions of plans and events still in gestation, and knowing those
plans can help provide many clues to the meaning of events still to come.
Beyond that, the past is always prologue to the future.
By studying the many events which ran their
course during the seven-odd years of the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER series, one
can learn a great deal about the underlying forces still at work in our
world.
