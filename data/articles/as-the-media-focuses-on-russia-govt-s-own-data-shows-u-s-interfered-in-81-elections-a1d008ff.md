# As the Media Focuses on Russia, Govt's Own Data Shows U.S. Interfered in 
81 Elections

On Monday, FBI
Director James Comey
confirmed for the first time publicly the bureau is
officially investigating hotly contentious allegations of
Russian meddling in the U.S. election - but, even if proven
true, such geopolitical escapades better characterize the
routine behavior of accuser than of accused.
"The F.B.I., as
part of our counterintelligence effort, is investigating the
Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 president
election," the director
announced, adding the bureau would conduct a probe to
discern whether Trump's associates had contact with Russian
officials.
Despite that
the U.S. has hypocritically exerted influence over foreign
elections in all corners of the globe - in fact, it has
arrogantly done so a whopping
81 times between 1946 and 2000, alone (When
the Great Power Gets a Vote - The Effects of Great Power
Electoral Interventions on Election Results) - with just one-third
of those operations undertaken overtly.
For months,
mainstream media parroted murky accusations hurled by
politicians - keen to point a finger of blame for the apparently
stultifying victory of a former reality television host on
someone - that The Russians had somehow surreptitiously
undermined the election-centric foundation of American
Democracy.
While that has
yet to prove true, this new Red Scare constitutes a duplicitous
attempt by the pot to call the kettle
an election meddler.
Researcher Dov
Levin of Carnegie Mellon University's Institute for Politics and
Strategy - an expert on the topic at hand -
discussed the lengthy but incomplete list of times the U.S.
government has interfered in other nations' elections with NPR's
Ari Shapiro.
Asked for
examples where this tampering tangibly altered results, Levin
stated,
"One example of
that was our intervention in Serbia, Yugoslavia in the 2000
election there.
Slobodan Milosevic was running for re-election,
and we didn't want him to stay in power there due to his
tendency, you know, to disrupts the Balkans and his human rights
violations.
"So we
intervened in various ways for the opposition candidate,
Vojislav Kostunica. And we gave funding to the opposition, and
we gave them training and campaigning aide.
And according to my
estimate, that assistance was crucial in enabling the opposition
to win."
Levin
reiterated the more blatant methods with which the U.S. asserts
dominance - through the overt coups or all-out regime changes
branding the nation a notorious interventionist - are not among
the list of the 80-plus attempts to manipulate the electoral
outcome.
As for the
issue of pot versus kettle, Levin explained that - although
Russia and other powerful nations indisputably employ similar
tactics - the United States has been quite prodigious in its
effort.
"Well, for my
dataset, the United States is the most common user of this
technique. Russia or the Soviet Union since 1945 has used it
half as much. My estimate has been 36 cases between 1946 to
2000.
We know also that the Chinese have used this technique and
the Venezuelans
when the late Hugo Chavez was still in power in
Venezuela and other countries."
As
sanctimoniously as U.S. politicians cry foul about The Russians,
it would behoove the new McCarthyites to reflect on the nation's
sticky imperialist fingerprints around the globe - like that
time in 1996,
when the United States undertook an extensive, secret operation
to ensure the presidency of Boris Yeltsin.
That is, of
course, former President Boris Yeltsin - of the Russian
Federation.
