A new wave of
camouflage
is underway at
the Pentagon and the CIA.
The bin Laden
death files contained in the Pentagons data bank
have become the
object of controversy.
Navy Vice Admiral William McRaven has
been entrusted in removing these secret military files concerning the May
2011 Navy SEAL raid on Osama bin Ladens alleged hideout
in Abbotabad, Pakistan from the Pentagons
data banks.
The files of the bin Laden SEAL operation had to
be removed to sustain the Big Lie.
Osama was allegedly killed on the orders of the
US government, despite ample evidence that he was already dead at the time
of the attack:
the US government pulled off one of the
most audacious stunts of the 21st century, when on May 2nd 2011 they
claimed to have killed Osama bin Laden during a Navy SEAL operation in
Abbottabad, Pakistan.
The contemptuously sloppy story spun by the
US government, parroted without question by the controlled corporate
media, and obligingly swallowed by a largely gullible Western public,
was dubious in the extreme.

Who was killed? Was it Osama bin Laden or
someone else?
Rest in Peace, Truth will prevail. The
files are no longer at the Pentagon, they have been sent to the CIA, in
violation of the Freedom of Information Act.
The White House tacitly acknowledges that the
procedure of moving government records was in violation of federal norms:
A draft report by the Pentagons
inspector-general briefly described the secret move, which was directed
by the top US special operations commander, Admiral William McRaven.
The transfer did not set off alarms
within the Obama administration even though it
appears to have sidestepped rules governing federal records and
circumvented the Freedom of Information Act.
President Barack Obama has pledged to make
his administration the most transparent in US history.
The CIA said the documents were handled in a
manner consistent with the fact that the operation was conducted under
the CIAs direction.
(Belfast Telegraph, July 8, 2013)
The Pentagon spokesperson denied the fact that
the removal of these files was to avoid the legal requirements of the
Freedom of Information Act.
But secretly moving the records
allowed the Pentagon to tell The Associated Press that it couldnt find
any documents inside the Defense Department that AP had requested more
than two years ago, and could represent a new strategy for the U.S.
government to shield even its most sensitive activities from public
scrutiny.
New York Daily News
According to the official statement, the
record transfer from the Pentagon to the CIA has nothing to do with Freedom
of Information.
Its objective was,
to
protect the names of the personnel involved in the raid, according to
the inspector generals draft report.
Protect whom? Several members of the SEAL raid
are now dead, allegedly due to combat and training accidents.
The list of names in the Osama death files is
known to US intelligence but not to the broader public, nor to family
members:
According to the
New York Times, 79 commandos and a dog were involved in the raid
that killed Osama bin Laden - though
other reports peg the number at approximately 24.
Since the raid, SEAL Team Six - the team
that conducted the Bin Laden raid - has
lost several members due to combat and training accidents,
though none of them have been confirmed as being specifically part of
the Bin Laden raid.
The largest loss to the team took place in
April of 2011 when Taliban fighters
shot down a U.S. helicopter and
killed 22 members of SEAL Team Six, along with 16 other U.S. troops.
None of those SEALs, however, were reported to have worked on the Bin
Laden raid. Separately, the BeforeItsNews piece references Cmdr.
Job W. Price, who committed suicide in
December of 2012, as being another person connected to the Bin Laden
raid who has died. This accusation doesnt hold up because
Price was reportedly part of SEAL Team Four, not Six, and was not
part of the Bin Laden raid.
The most recent death tied to SEAL Team Six
took place on March 28, when Special Warfare Operator Chief Brett D.
Shadle
was killed in a parachute training accident when he collided in
midair with another SEAL over the Arizona desert.
He was later identified as being a part of
Team Six, though its unclear if he was actually assigned to the Bin
Laden mission.
The problem with completely confirming or
disproving the accusation that so many
SEAL Team Six members have died is that the U.S. military typically does
not disclose which units special forces members work on, even after
their deaths.
In interviews with MSN News, spokespeople at
the U.S. Navy, Pentagon and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) each
refused to comment on the BeforeItsNews article or the claim that
25 members of the Bin Laden raid team
have died.
(MSN
News, April 9, 2013)
The members of SEAL Team Six know the untold
truth. And they are forbidden to reveal it.
Many credible commentators, including respected
intelligence analysts and heads of state, had claimed years before
2011 that bin Laden was dead.
(Brit Dee, op cit)
Several members of SEAL Team Six which carried
out the attack are now dead.
The Osama Legend is now classified, buried in
the Osama Death files stored in the archives of the CIA.
Only the CIA knows the names of the surviving
members of the SEAL team involved in the
May 2011 Osama Abbotabad raid.
