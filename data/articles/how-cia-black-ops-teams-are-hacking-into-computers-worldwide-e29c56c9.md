# How CIA Black Ops Teams are Hacking into Computers Worldwide

In
a
detailed account on Foreign Policy,
the
Central Intelligence Agency, in concert with
the
National Security Agency, has been demonstrated to conduct
what is referred to as "black bag" operations, or the manual hacking of
a target's computer by uploading spyware onto anything ranging
from personal laptops to large-scale servers.
When a specific target is out of the NSA's
reach, it calls on the CIA to do, in its own parlance, a "surreptitious
entry."
In such an operation, a crack CIA team
breaks into the place of interest and does one of the following,
depending on the situation: install spy-ware, bug phones, hack data
switching centers, and copy backup files and disks. It is a procedure
often used when hacking remotely is not possible.
Having already conducted over 100 such
operations, it is a rate that,
according to Matthew Aid, has not been seen since the Cold War.
And the targets are not as narrow as one
might think; in addition to foreign governments and militaries,
multinational corporations and individuals with terrorist ties have
been hacked as well.
From a regional perspective, everyone is a
target; operations have been undertaken in,
An example of such would be the tapping of
fiber-optic cables at a switch center in a certain South Asian country,
allowing the NSA to listen in real time highly sensitive communications.
This is also in addition to
the NSA bugging of foreign embassies in
Latin America and Western Europe in addition various European Union
offices in Washington and New York. While the former are areas of
strategic importance, the latter has caused much outrage, since these
are supposedly allies to the U.S.
How important are such operations to
national security? Or is it more unethical, wanton spying?
Considering how old the art of espionage is,
and that these operations are a modernization of what was done during
the Cold War, it should not come as a complete surprise that the CIA
still conducts these operations.
What is surprising are the sheer number of
operations being conducted, and how we do not know how effective it
truly is. Considering the amount of sensitive information received
through such operations, we may never know not only how effective black
bag operations are, but how expansive they are.
These black bag operations are one of many
tools in the CIA's ever-expanding toolkit; however, they has become a
significant tool just by how often it has been utilized, particularly
after 9/11.
It is an expanding operation that has shown
unprecedented cooperation between two former rivals with no signs of
scaling back.
