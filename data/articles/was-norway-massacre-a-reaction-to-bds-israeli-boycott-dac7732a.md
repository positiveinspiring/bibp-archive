I learned last night from an Israeli online
journal, that two days before the
Utoya Island massacre, AUFs (Labour
Partys youth movement) leader Eskil Pedersen gave an interview to
the Dagbladet, Norways second largest tabloid newspaper, in which he unveiled
what he thinks of Israel.
In the course of the interview, Pedersen stated that he,
believes the time
has come for more drastic measures against Israel, and (that he) wants the
Foreign Minister to impose an economic boycott against the country.
Pederson went on to say,
The peace process goes nowhere, and though the
whole world expect Israel to comply, they do not. We in Labour Youth will
have a unilateral economic embargo of Israel from the Norwegian side.
The AUF Labour Party Youth Movement have been devoted promoters of the
Israel Boycott campaign, The Dagbladet newspaper reporting that,
The AUF has
long been a supporter of an international boycott of Israel, but the
decision at the last congress, demands that Norway imposes a unilateral
economic embargo on the country and it must be stricter than before.
I acknowledge that this is a drastic measure, stated Pedersen, but I
think it gives a clear indication that we are tired of Israels behavior,
quite simply.
Yesterday we also learned that mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik was
openly
enthusiastic about Israel.
According to a variety of internet outlets, Behring Breivik was a regular
poster on several Norwegian internet sites, notably
the blog document.no,
which is run by Hans Rustad, a former left-wing journalist.
Hans Rustad is Jewish, extremely pro-Zionist, and warns against Islam-ization,
violence, and other social problems he assumes to be connected with Muslim
immigration.
Norway Blogger Hans Rustad
Alongside the UKs infamously Islamophobic
Harry's Place and other Jewish
pro-war Zionist blogs, the observant amongst us are becoming more and more
aware of an increasingly pervasive trend of Jerusalemite internet journals
that - ostensibly - like to give the impression of rallying for the
preservation of Western culture, and of standing up for democratic
values.
For the most obvious of reasons, these blog pages are almost exclusively
focused on the problem of Islam, and on 'Muslim migrants troubled and
reactionary communities and politics, whilst all the while, simultaneously,
relentlessly and forcefully propounding a propagandistic Zionist agenda.
Interestingly enough, other immigrants are routinely depicted on these blog
pages as being harmless, or as positive contributors to society,
...you wont find
Hans Rustad or
Harry Place criticizing the Jewish Lobbies,
the Lord Levys or the Russian Oligarchs disastrous impact on Western
culture or on democratic values any time soon.
Gordon Duff
wrote yesterday in Veterans Today that the,
car bombing
carries the signature of an intelligence agency. Nobody else bothers with
such things.
And indeed it is after all, pretty clear that a car bomb of such magnitude,
and an operation of such sophistication is not exactly something a layman
can put together with such apparent ease: it would surely take some
specialist knowledge, and the question here is, who could provide such
knowledge, and such a vast amount of lethal explosives?
I am not in a position at present to firmly point a finger at Israel, its
agents, or its sayanim - but assembling the information together, and
considering all possibilities may suggest that Anders Behring Breivik might
indeed, have been a
Sabbath Goy.
Within its Judaic mundane-societal context, the Sabbath Goy is simply there
to accomplish some minor tasks the Jews cannot undertake during the Sabbath.
But within the Zion-ized reality we tragically enough live in, the Sabbath
Goy kills for the Jewish state. He may even do it voluntarily.
Being an admirer of Israel, Behring Breivik does appear to have treated his
fellow countrymen in the same way that the IDF treats Palestinians.
Devastatingly enough, in Israel, Behring Breivik found a few enthusiastic
followers who praised his action against the Norwegian youth.
In
the Hebrew article that reported about the AUF camp being pro Palestinian
and supportive of the Israel Boycott Campaign, I found the following
comments amongst other supports for the massacre:
24. Oslo criminals paid
26. Its
stupidity and evil not to desire death for those who call to boycott
Israel."
41. Hitler Youth members killed in the bombing of Germany were also
innocent. Let us all cry about the terrible evil bombardment carried out by
the Allied
We have a bunch of haters of Israel meeting in a country that
hates Israel in a conference that endorses the boycott... So its not okay,
not nice, really a tragedy for families, and we condemn the act itself, but
to cry about it? Come on. We Jews are not Christians. In the Jewish religion
there is no obligation to love or mourn for the enemy.
Who-What Really Made Him Pull the Trigger So Many Times
The full facts of the Norwegian tragedy are, as yet, unknown, but the
message should by now be transparently and urgently clear to all of us:
Western intelligence agencies must immediately crackdown on Israeli and
Zionist operators in our midst, and regarding the terrible events of the
weekend.
It must be made absolutely clear who it was that spread such hate and
promoted such terror, and for what exact reasons.
