C.H. Smith nailed it:
"There is no avenue left for advocacy, grievances or redress in a system dominated by global corporations."
In the old feudal days, peasants with pitchforks and torches could assault the lord's castle on a hill. Today, there is no castle nor even a hill. Yet, we still have the same grievances, angst and desires for peace, safety and prosperity. Smith writes,
The reality is there is no avenue left for advocacy, grievances or redress in a system dominated by global corporations. The castle on the hill doesn't exist; it is diffused all over the planet, and well protected by state minions controlled by neofeudal corporate interests. Do you really think it's mere coincidence that small business growth has imploded in the era of corporate dominance?
As I explained yesterday in Governments Change, the Corporatocracy Endures, central banks dropping interest rates to near-zero for financiers and corporations sealed corporate dominance of finance and governance. There are few opportunities for small businesses when the financial and political structures serve neofeudal corporate interests. Corporate power destroys democracy. That is the heart of neofeudalism.

Let me explain what happened here. In 1970, Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote Between Two Ages - America's Role in the Technetronic Era.
Three years later in 1973, Brzezinski teamed up with financier David Rockefeller to start the Trilateral Commission that was dedicated to,
"fostering a New International Economic Order."
Brzezinski explained,
"The nation-state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state." Between Two Ages
"The nation-state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state."
Between Two Ages
Antony Sutton and I wrote (Trilaterals Over Washington, I and II) and lectured extensively on this in the late 1970s.
It's too bad that more people didn't listen to us back then, but the establishment made sure that we were thoroughly marginalized and discredited.
In fact, the nation's largest book chain at the time, B. Dalton Booksellers, blatantly black-listed our books by sending out a memo to all their stores that stated,
"Trilaterals Over Washington is out of print and the publisher is out of business."
Neither was true, but it killed our sales. So,
What part of Brzezinski's statement above is unclear? Was Between Two Ages some sort of literary equivalent to Hitler's Mien Kampf in which he laid out the elites' plans in terms so clear that nobody would believe them?

Whatever the case, Brzezinski envisioned the "ultimate solution" in his carefully defined "Technetronic Era." What is the "Technetronic Era"? Plain and simple, it is a vision rooted in historic Technocracy from the 1930s.
It is also the resurrection of feudalism with many new twists thanks to advanced technology. Thus, the term neofeudalism fits Technocracy or Technetronic perfectly:
A few own all the resources and then tell everyone else what they can or can't do on planet earth.
In 1938, The Technocrat magazine defined Technocracy as follows:
"Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population "
This is exactly what is happening today:
social engineers working with global corporations to take over the entire economic and social landscape.
Thus, society is being 'scientifically' reengineered to serve the corporate lords.
The old-fashioned terms of 'supply' and 'demand' don't apply any more. Consumer demand is artificially manipulated to soak up whatever global corporations decide they want to manufacture. In other words, Technocracy is a complete takeover of both the means of production and consumption, a feat never before attempted nor achieved in the history of the world. You might never have heard of Technocracy before, but can you feel the manacle of scientific dictatorship tightening around your neck? In my opinion, this is why Britain recently voted to leave the European Union, which is openly called a Technocracy in the European press. This is also why Trumpism is accelerating in America. Simply put, people don't have to understand the cause in order to feel the pain. Oh, would that there were a castle on a hill that we could assault and demand that our grievances be heard.
However, because Technocracy and Technocrats are so thoroughly infused into society, institutions and corporate culture, it is impossible to hold their feet to the fire.
Neofeudalism and Peasants with Pitchforks
- Corporate Power Destroys Democracy - by Charles Hugh Smith

There is no avenue left for advocacy, grievances or redress in a system dominated by global corporations.
In the original version of feudalism, peasants armed with pitchforks knew where to go for redress or regime change:
the feudal lord's castle on the hill.
Though you won't find this in conventional narratives of the Middle Ages, peasant revolts were a common occurrence.
Serfs weren't always delighted to toil for their noble masters.
In the present era of corporate dominance, where can serfs go to demand redress and financial freedom from the neofeudal system? Now here. The global corporations that own the land and the productive assets have no castle that can be stormed; they exist in an abstract financial world of stock shares, buybacks, bonds, lobbyists and political influence. When the agribusiness corporation fouls the local water supply with animal waste, where do the local peasantry go to demand restoration of their water quality? The corporation? What if the headquarters are thousands of miles away? What impact will 100 serfs gathered outside the modern-day castle have on water quality in a distant land? Zero, because the corporation has rendered it illegal (via lobbying the local political flunkies desperate for "jobs" and campaign contributions) to even take photos of their vast animal-waste output or their inadequate disposal. Where do oppressed serfs go to advocate for transparency in America's private Gulag prison system? If you go to the prison to protest, you'll be arrested and will soon be looking at the world from inside the privately operated gulag. Once again - where is the castle on the hill? It's not there. The corporate operators of the private Gulag are far away, and security will disperse any troublesome serfs who travel hundreds of miles to air grievances.

Documenting abuses in the privately owned and operated Gulag is illegal.
Corporate lobbying and campaign contributions have ensured that any attempt to document neofeudal exploitation by corporations is illegal. And of course if documentation is impossible to obtain, then the exploitation doesn't exist.
The mainstream media's default setting is to dismiss first-hand accounts as "he said, she said":
the imprisoned serf says this, and the private prison spokesperson says that, and without any proof that can stand up in court, the grievance vanishes into thin air.
Try telling the African peasant who is unhappy with the Chinese owners of the land he tills to take his grievances to the owners of the land - a corporation in distant China that is owned by the Chinese army.
The reality is there is no avenue left for advocacy, grievances or redress in a system dominated by global corporations. The castle on the hill doesn't exist; it is diffused all over the planet, and well protected by state minions controlled by neofeudal corporate interests.

That is the heart of neofeudalism...
