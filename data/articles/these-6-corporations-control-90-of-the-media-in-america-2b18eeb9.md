This infographic created by Jason at Frugal Dad shows that almost all media
comes from the same six sources.
That's consolidated from 50 companies back in 1983.

of choice," Frugal Dad says. While some big sites, like Digg and Reddit
aren't owned by any of the corporations, Time Warner owns news sites read by
millions of Americans every year.
