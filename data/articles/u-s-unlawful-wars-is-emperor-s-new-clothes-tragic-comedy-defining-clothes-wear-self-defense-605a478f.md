# U.S. Unlawful Wars is 'Emperor's New Clothes' Tragic-Comedy - Defining 
'Clothes,' 'Wear,' 'Self-defense'

The Emperor's New Clothes
is the same story as current U.S. wars:
The Emperor's New
Clothes
has government officials, messengers (corporate media), and many in the
public claim that political leadership is "covered" by the noblest of
appearances, and that those who fail to perceive this are either "unfit
for his position" or "hopelessly stupid."
The game-changing fact is that the emperor
is naked, and not even close to wearing clothes.
This fact is easily explained, objectively
observed, and proved. Indeed, a child points it out with easy
confidence, irrefutable accuracy, and proves the official story has zero
credibility for any objective observer.
In the story, upon public initial
conversations of the facts, the emperor continues the pretense, along
with two "officials." However, the illusion is shattered
within
moments as the "whole town" began speaking about what was
clear for anyone who cared to look.
If we had to document the facts that refute
the official story, we would probably define a few key terms:
-
clothes: material for
the human body to be worn for adornment and coverage.
-
wear: in context of
clothing, to have clothes intentionally placed on one's body.
This is opposed to having clothes in one's closet or dresser not
on one's body.
The story isn't explicit whether the emperor
was naked or with underwear, and the child's recorded testimony is,
"he hasn't got anything on."
If he wasn't naked, with a little more work
we could prove that people clearly distinguish between
underwear and
clothing, no matter how
new the underwear arguably may be.
Therefore, with just a little work, we
refute the "official story," and use the facts to make ridiculous any
argument in support of this official story.
And importantly, if we did
have to document our evidence even
though clear to a child's examination within moments, it would take some
work to write and read, just as our next argument will take with current
U.S. unlawful wars.
U.S.
unlawful wars: The
U.S. "official story"
is that current U.S. wars are lawful because they
are "self-defense."
The game-changer here is that "self-defense"
means something quite narrow and specific in war law, and the facts of
U.S. armed attacks on so many nations in current and past wars are not
even close to the meaning of this term.
Among dozens in independent media,
I've explained and documented (here
and
here recently) that
"self-defense" has a universally agreed
meaning
in use of a nation's military for armed attack: you can only used armed
attack on another nation if that nation's government has attacked your
nation, or there is provable imminent threat of attack.
Importantly, a nation can use military,
police, and civilians in self-defense from any attack upon the nation.
This is similar to the legal definition of "self-defense" for you or I
walking down the street: we cannot attack anyone unless either under
attack or imminent threat of attack. And, if under attack, we can use
any reasonable force in self-defense, including lethal.
As the above two links document, and you may
recall, no nation's government attacked the U.S. on 9/11, and U.S. officials
agreed they had no evidence of any imminent threat. Despite this
crystal-clear legal limit, and legal recourse through the UN Security
Council for any security concern, the U.S. has used armed attacks on many
nations despite not meeting the legal requirement to do so.
In addition, U.S. official reports now
confirm
all "reasons" the U.S. told for these armed attacks were
known to be false as they were told.
The categories of crime for armed attacks
outside U.S. treaty limits of law are:
-
Wars of Aggression (the worst crime
a nation can commit)
-
Likely
treason for lying to U.S. military, ordering unlawful attack
and invasions of foreign lands, and causing thousands of U.S.
military deaths
A child can discern this if paying
attention:
if he/she saw someone physically attack
you as you were simply walking along, the child could safely
conclude that you did not attack the person, and did nothing to
cause concern for any danger.
The child could also tell that if the person
responded to you after you hit him,
or that you picked up a bottle and shouted with anger causing the person
to respond to that threat, that these cases would justify the person's
self-defense.
Moral
of the stories:
Certainly, as an adult,
you can tell the difference in both categories of personal and national
self-defense when you pay attention to the facts.
And if you wish to
have civil and political freedom, certainly you recognize the game to
cause a critical mass of the public to also discern the game-changing
facts from whatever
bullsh*t our lying sacks of spin "leaders" attempt.
U.S. wars and rhetoric for more wars continue
a
long history of lie-began U.S. Wars of Aggression since the
U.S. invaded Mexico; despite Abraham Lincoln's powerfully accurate
rhetoric of President Polk's lies to steal half of Mexico.
The
most decorated U.S. Marine general in his day also warned all Americans
of this fact of lie-started wars for 1% plunder.
Such
lie-began and unlawful U.S. wars have killed ~30 million since WW2,
arguably
more than Hitler's Nazis. Of 248 armed conflicts since WW2
the U.S. started 201, with 90% of these ~30 million deaths being civilian;
innocent children, the elderly, and ordinary working men and women.
The
2014 Worldwide Wave of Action (here)
began on the April 4 anniversary of
Martin King's assassination by the U.S. government (civil court trial
verdict), with this operation completing ~July 4 (Martin'
2-minute plea to you).
Purpose of
this operation:
American Leaders JOKE about Dead Veterans and Children
