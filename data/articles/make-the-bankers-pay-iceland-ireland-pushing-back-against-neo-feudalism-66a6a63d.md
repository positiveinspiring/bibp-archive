Across the dominion of the corporate-financiers
on Wall Street and in the city of London, the reckless Ponzi schemes
destroying the West's economy and plunging it into an economic depression
have left politicians, the bought and paid for servants of
corporate-financier hegemony, wringing the public dry to cover losses.
In reality, when an enterprise fails because of
criminality, incompetence or both, citizens are not demanded to pass the hat
around to "bail them out."
They are declared bankrupt, their assets (if
they have any) are stripped, often if fraud is involved, executives and
board members go to jail, and society attempts to fill the void with sounder
enterprises run by more reputable people.
However, when the fraud and failure unfolds amongst the highest levels of
corporate-financier power, amongst men who have organized wars that have
sent millions to their deaths, overseen social "projects" that have left
hundreds of thousands of women forcibly sterilized, and instead of going to
jail, are showered with self-aggrandizing awards from institutions of their
own creation.
This faux-authority, faux-legitimacy has left
the people subjected to their machinations with the illusion that they must
pay for, heed, follow whatever solutions are then prescribed by the very
elite who created the problem in the first place.
Indeed, if we want this current system to continue - it would be wise to
follow their instructions to the letter.
However, if we are unsatisfied with this system,
it is important to not only protest these unjust measures, to refuse
absolutely to abide by any of their edicts, but to create and promote our
own programs to put society back on the rails of progress and moving
forward.

discusses a possible push-back
by the Irish people against
debt that isn't theirs.
Iceland was one of the first nations during the
latest round of global financier manipulation to say "no."
The bankers created the problem, Icelanders
said, so the bankers will pay for it, not the Icelandic people. Ireland has
followed suit - in the face of a draconian, neo-feudal "house tax" leveled
against the Irish - essentially forcing people to pay for the "privilege" of
living on their own land, have overwhelming refused to pay it.
While it may be "illegal" to say no to the
neo-feudal house tax, paid to corporate-financiers who apparently see
themselves as neo-lords, it is certainly not wrong. It is wrong, in fact, to
heed to unjust laws created by self-serving minorities at the expense ($130
USD per home) of the majority.
The Irish have followed this noble defiance with a campaign - predictably
muted by a willfully ignorant international media - called "Farmers For No."
Farmers for No is an organization that is
precisely what is needed - not austerity measures - but grassroots
organizing and cooperation at a local level, to solve local economic woes,
with local solutions.
Farmers for No is currently campaigning to follow
Iceland's example and vote no against austerity, and instead default on
loans the Irish people are already being demanded to pay for, but loans they
are in no way responsible for.
While Farmers for No is fighting its battle "far off" on the Emerald Isle,
their fight is our fight.
Whether you live in Greece, Spain, France, or
England, across the sea in the United States, or in Asia - which is
currently pursing the same sort of financier consolidation, directed by Wall
Street and London, and leading to the very sort of catastrophic meltdown the
West has just experienced - Farmers For No's battle is yours.

explains how banker debt bailouts
are not the responsibility of
sovereign states.

Next, Farmers for No, and grassroots
organizations around the financially-wrecked Western world, must begin
devising, promoting, and implementing pragmatic programs of their own -
after making it clear they will not accept such programs to be decided for
them by the very people, criminals even, who created the problem in the
first place.
While we may differ in opinions as to what we
should do, any program truly devised by the people and for the people will
be preferable to anything devised by Wall Street, London, and other Western
financiers gravitating toward their orbit. Most likely a synergy between
local free market and national investments in production, real education,
and infrastructure would be best.
Additionally, taxing (with a
Tobin tax) the
banks themselves to bailout nations from monolithic and ever-increasing
debt, should be considered in lieu of wringing dry the populations of the
West with austerity.
However, whatever your opinion may be, nothing will happen so long as you
sit on the sidelines, or worst yet, continue patronizing the corporations
and banks behind economic, foreign, or domestic policies you disagree with.
We must begin to organize ourselves, begin
promoting and implementing our own ideas on a local level, leveraging
technology to do so, and stop waiting for a "buffet of palatable options" to
be spread out before us by the very criminals that have historically
exploited, misled, and plundered our society for generations.
