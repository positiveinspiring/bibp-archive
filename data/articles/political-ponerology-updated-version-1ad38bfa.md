"A science on the nature of evil adjusted for political purposes''
''Political Ponerology is an invaluable work that every human being striving
to become conscious, should read, not only for its expose of the pathology
of the individuals currently in control of the United States government, but
also the light it may shed on individuals closer to home, some of whom may
be friends, fellow-activists, business or civic leaders.
The book's purpose
is not to incite paranoia, but to cultivate discernment and buttress our
trust of our innate intuition in order to navigate the daunting
manifestations of evil that surround us in the twenty-first century.''
Carolyn Baker
