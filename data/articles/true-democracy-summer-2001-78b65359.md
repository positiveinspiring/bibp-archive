# TRUE DEMOCRACY SUMMER 2001

CIA self-financing
The operation and/or control of much of the international drug trade in
heroin, cocaine and marijuana, as well as "front" business enterprises as
a source of cash for off-the-books covert operations, and the purchase of
exotic munition and strategic bribe funds.
As publisher of True Democracy (La verdad sobre la democracia), I
tried very hard to obtain permission to reprint two articles which Mike Ruppert
published on his Web site regarding the CIA's connection with cocaine and
heroin. However, he wanted payment for them stating to me that since I have
obtained some subscribers, he is forced to charge me since it would be discriminatory
to give me what he gives others who disseminate their published works at no
charge.
The very fact, however, that Dr. Boylan states unequivocally that the CIA's
"operation and/or control of much of the international drug trade in heroin,
cocaine and marijuana" proves that they do.
Fortunately, since I proved to the entire world that President Kennedy wanted
to disband the CIA, when we disband it, then we will end this practice too.
