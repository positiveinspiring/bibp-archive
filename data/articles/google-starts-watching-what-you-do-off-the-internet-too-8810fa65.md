# Google Starts Watching What You Do Off The Internet Too...

The most powerful company on the Internet just
got a whole lot creepier:
a new service from Google merges offline
consumer info with online intelligence, allowing advertisers to target
users based on what they do at the keyboard and at the mall.
Without much fanfare, Google announced news this
week of a new advertising project,
Conversions API, that will let businesses
build all-encompassing user profiles based off of not just what users search
for on the Web, but what they purchase outside of the home.
In a blog post this week on
Googles DoubleClick Search site, the
Silicon Valley giant says that targeting consumers based off online
information only allows advertisers to learn so much.
Conversions, tech-speak for the digital metric
made by every action a user makes online, are incomplete until coupled with
real life data, Google says.
We understand that online advertising also
fuels offline conversions, the blog post reads.
Thus, Google says,
To capture these lost conversions and bring
offline into your online world, were announcing the open beta of our
Conversions API for uploading offline conversion automatically.
The blog goes on to explain that in-store
transactions, call-tracking and other online activities can be inputted into
Google to be combined with other information,
to optimize your campaigns based on even
more of your business data.
Google is all but certain to ensure that
all user data collected off- and online will be cloaked through
safeguards that will allow for complete and total anonymity for
customers.
When on-the-Web interactions start mirroring
real life activity, though, even a certain degree of privacy doesnt make
Conversions API any less creepy.
As Jim Edwards writes for Business
Insider,
If you bought a T shirt at The Gap in the
mall with your credit card, you could start seeing a lot more Gap ads
online later, suggesting jeans that go with that shirt.
Of course, there is always the possibility that
all of this information can be unencrypted and, in some cases, obtained by
third-parties that you might not want prying into your personal business.
Edwards notes in his report that Google does not
explicitly note that intelligence used in Conversions API will be anonymized,
but the blowback from not doing as much would sure be enough to start a
colossal uproar.
Meanwhile, however, all of the information being
collected by Google - estimated to be on millions of servers around the
globe - is being handed over to more than just advertising companies.
Last month Google reported that the US
government requested personal information from roughly 8,000 individual
users during just the first few months of 2012.
This is the sixth time weve released this
data, and one trend has become clear: Government surveillance is on the
rise, Google admitted with their report.
