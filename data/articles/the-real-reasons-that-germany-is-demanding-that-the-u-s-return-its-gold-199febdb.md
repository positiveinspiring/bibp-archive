Why Is Germany Demanding
...300 Tons of
Gold from the U.S. and 374 Tons from France?
The Germans are demanding that the U.S. return
all of the 374 tons of gold held by the Bank of France, and 300 tons of the
1500 tons of bullion held by the New York Federal Reserve.
Some say that Germany is only demanding
repatriation of its gold due to internal political pressures, and that no
other countries will do so.
But Pimco co-CEO El Erian
says:
In the first instance, it could translate
into pressures on other countries to also repatriate part of their gold
holdings.
After all, if you can safely store your gold
at home - a big if for some countries - no government would wish to be
seen as one of the last to outsource all of this activity to foreign
central banks.
As we
noted last November:
Romania has
demanded for many years that Russia return its gold.
Last year, Venezuela
demanded the return of 90 tons of gold from the Bank of England.

As Zero Hedge
notes (quoting Bloomberg):
Ecuadors government wants the nations banks to repatriate about
one third of their foreign holdings to support national growth, the
head of the countrys tax agency said.
Carlos Carrasco, director of the tax
agency known as the SRI, said today that Ecuadors
lenders could repatriate about $1.7 billion and still fulfill
obligations to international clients.
Carrasco spoke at a
congressional hearing in Quito on a government proposal to raise
taxes on banks to finance cash subsidies to the South American
nations poor.
Four members of the Swiss Parliament
want Switzerland to reclaim its gold.
Some people in the Netherlands
want their gold back as well.
(Forbes
notes that Iran and Libya have recently repatriated their gold as well).
The Telegraphs lead economics writer -
Ambrose Evans Pritchard - argues that the German repatriation demand
shows that were switching to a
de facto gold standard:
Central banks around the world bought more
bullion last year in terms of tonnage than at any time in almost half a
century.
They added a net 536 tonnes in 2012 as they
diversified fresh reserves away from the four fiat suspects: dollar,
euro, sterling, and yen.
The Washington Accord, where Britain, Spain,
Holland, South Africa, Switzerland, and others sold a chunk of their
gold each year, already seems another era - the Gordon Brown era, you
might call it.
That was the illusionary period when
investors thought the euro would take its place as the twin pillar of a
new G2 condominium alongside the dollar. That hope has faded. Central
bank holdings of euro bonds have fallen back to 26pc, where they were
almost a decade ago.
Neither the euro nor the dollar can inspire
full confidence, although for different reasons. EMU is a dysfunctional
construct, covering two incompatible economies, prone to lurching from
crisis to crisis, without a unified treasury to back it up. The dollar
stands on a pyramid of debt.
We all know that this debt will be inflated
away over time - for better or worse. The only real disagreement is over
the speed.
***
My guess is that any new Gold Standard will
be sui generis, and better for it.
Let gold will take its place as a
third reserve currency, one that cannot be devalued, and one that holds
the others to account, but not so dominant that it hitches our
collective destinies to the inflationary ups (yes, gold was highly
inflationary after the Conquista) and the deflationary downs of global
mine supply.
***
A third reserve currency is just what
America needs.
As Prof Micheal Pettis from Beijing University has
argued, holding the worlds reserve currency is an exorbitant burden
that the US could do without.
The Triffin Dilemma - advanced by the
Belgian economist Robert Triffin in the 1960s - suggests that the holder
of the paramount currency faces an inherent contradiction. It must run a
structural trade deficit over time to keep the system afloat, but this
will undermine its own economy. The system self-destructs.
A partial Gold Standard - created by the
global market, and beholden to nobody - is the best of all worlds. It
offers a store of value (though no yield). It acts a balancing force. It
is not dominant enough to smother the system.
Let us have three world currencies, a tripod
with a golden leg. It might even be stable.
How Much Gold Is There?
Its not confidence-inspiring that CNBCs senior
editor John Carney argues that
it doesnt matter whether or not the U.S. has the physical gold it
claims to hold.
In fact, many allege that
the gold is gone:
Cheviot Asset Managements Ned
Naylor-Leyland says that the FED and Bank of England will
never return gold to its foreign owners.
Jim Willie
says that the gold is gone.
***
Others allege that the gold has not been
sold outright, but has been leased or encumbered, so that the U.S. does
not own it outright.
$10 billion dollar fund manager Eric Sprott
writes - in an article entitled Do
Western Central Banks Have Any Gold Left???:
If the Western central banks are indeed
leasing out their physical reserves, they would not actually have to
disclose the specific amounts of gold that leave their respective
vaults.
According to a document on the European
Central Banks (ECB) website regarding the statistical treatment of
the Eurosystems International Reserves, current reporting
guidelines do not require central banks to differentiate between
gold owned outright versus gold lent out or swapped with another
party.
The document states that, reversible
transactions in gold do not have any effect on the level of monetary
gold regardless of the type of transaction (i.e. gold
swaps, repos, deposits
or loans), in line with the recommendations contained in the IMF
guidelines.

Under current reporting guidelines,
therefore, central banks are permitted to continue carrying the
entry of physical gold on their balance sheet even if theyve
swapped it or lent it out entirely. You can see this in the way
Western central banks refer to their gold reserves.
Indeed, it is now well-documented that
the FED has leased out a large chunk of its gold reserves, and that big
banks
borrow gold from central banks and then to multiple parties.
As such, it might not entirely surprising that
the
FED needs 7 years to give Germany back its 300 tons of gold
even
though the FED claims to
hold 6,720 tons at the New York Federal Reserve Bank alone:
Even Pimco co-CEO Bill Gross
says:
When the FED now writes $85 billion of checks to buy Treasuries and mortgages every month, they really have
nothing in the bank to back them.
Supposedly they own a few billion dollars of gold certificates that
represent a fairy-tale claim on Ft. Knoxs secret stash, but theres
essentially nothing there but trust...
When a primary dealer such as J.P.
Morgan or Bank of America sells its Treasuries to the FED, it gets a
credit in its account with the FED, known as reserves. It can spend
those reserves for something else, but then another bank gets a credit
for its reserves and so on and so on.
The FED has told its member banks
Trust me, we will always honor your reserves, and so the banks do, and
corporations and ordinary citizens trust the banks, and the beat goes
on, as Sonny and Cher sang.
$54 trillion of credit in the U.S. financial system based
upon trusting a central bank with nothing in the vault to back it up.
Amazing!
And given that gold-plated tungsten has turned
up all over the world, and that a top German gold expert found fake gold
bars imprinted with official U.S. markings, Germans may have lost confidence
in the trustworthiness of the FED. See
this,
this,
this and
this.
This may especially be true since the FED
refused to allow Germans to inspect their own gold stored at the FED.
Currency War?
The gold repatriation is - without doubt-
related to currency.
As Forbes
notes:
Officials at the Bundesbank
acknowledged
the move is preemptive in case a currency crisis hits the European
Monetary Union.
***
No, we have no intention to sell gold, a
Bundesbank spokesman said on the phone Wednesday, [the relocation] is
in case of a currency crisis.
Reggie Middleton thinks that
Germanys demand for its gold is part of a currency war.
Jim Rickards has previously
said that the FED had plans to grab Germany gold:
Jim Rickards has outlined possible plans by
the Federal Reserve to commandeer Germanys and all foreign depositors
of sovereign gold at the New York Federal Reserve in the event of a
dollar and monetary crisis leading to intensified currency wars and
the nuclear option of a drastic upward revision of the price of gold
and a return to a quasi gold standard is contemplated by embattled
central banks to prevent debt deflation.
Is that one reason that Germany is demanding its
gold back now?
China is quietly becoming a
gold superpower, and China has long been rumored to be
converting the Yuan to a gold-backed currency.
The Telegraphs James Delingpole
points out:
Back in the mid-1920s, the head of the
German Central Bank, Herr Hjalmar Schacht, went to New York to see
Germanys gold. However the NY FED officials were unable to find the
palette of Germanys gold bullion.
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve,
Benjamin Strong was mortified, but to put him at ease Herr Schacht
turned to him and said Never mind, I believe you when you say the gold is there. Even if it werent you are good for its
replacement.
(H/T
The Real Asset Company)
But that was then and this is now. In the
eyes of the Germans - and who can blame them? - America has lost its
mojo to such a degree that it can no longer be trusted honor its debts,
even in the unlikely event that it were financially capable of doing so.
Which is why, following in the footsteps of
Venezuelas Hugo Chavez (who may be an idiot but is definitely no fool),
Germany is repatriatriating its gold from the US federal reserve. It
will now be stored in Frankfurt.
***
[Things] may look calm on the surface, but
this latest move by the Bundesbank gives us a pretty good indication
that beneath the surface that serene-seeming swan is paddling for dear
life.
If you want a full analysis I recommend
this excellent summary by Jan Skoyles.
The scary part is this bit:
Every few months there is a discussion
regarding what China are planning on doing with the gold they both
mine and import every year, with many believing they are hoarding
the metal as an insurance against the billions of US Treasury bonds,
notes and bills they hold.
Many believe they will issue some kind
of gold-backed currency in the short-term and dump its one trillion
dollars worth of US Treasury securities.
Whilst, at the moment the
US seem to take their monopoly currency for granted, should the
Chinese or anyone else behave in such a manner, the US will need to
respond - most likely with gold, which on its own it does not have
enough of.
Anyone who thinks this isnt going to happen
eventually should read Peter Schiffs parable
How An Economy Grows And Why It Crashes. If something cant go on
forever, it wont.
In other words, Rickards and Skoyles appear to
argue that Germany may be repatriating gold in the first round of musical
chairs in which China is preparing to roll out a gold-backed Yuan.
Under this theory, the rest of the worlds
currencies will sink unless their nations can scramble to get their hands
on enough gold to lend credibility to their paper.
Postscript
Michael Rivero
thinks that the war in Mali is connected:
Mali is one of the worlds largest gold
producers. Together with neighboring Ghana they account for 7-8% of
world gold output. That makes them a rich prize for nations desperate
for real physical gold.
So, even as Germany started demanding their
gold back from the Bank of France and the New York Federal Reserve,
France (aided by the US) decided to invade Mali to fight Islamists
working for Al Qaeda.
Of course, Islamists has become the
catch-all label for people that need to be killed to get them out of the
way of the path to riches, and the people being bombed by France (aided
by the US) are not Al Qaeda but Tawariqs, who have been fighting for
their independence for 150 years, long before the CIA created Al
Qaeda.
Left to themselves, the Tawariqs could sell
gold to whoever they want for whatever they want, and right now China
can outbid the US and France.
