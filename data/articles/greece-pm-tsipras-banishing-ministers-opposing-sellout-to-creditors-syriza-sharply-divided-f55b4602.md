Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis resigned after being pushed out - replaced by Euclid Tsakalotos. After leaving, he said he's no longer under,
"incredible pressure to negotiate for a position I find difficult to defend "
He cited the,
"complete lack of any democratic scruples (displayed by) the supposed 'defenders' of Europe's democracy. (V)ery powerful figures look you in the eye and say '(y)ou're right in what you're saying, but we're going to crunch you anyway'."
Paying dominant bankers and large creditors like Germany alone matters - no matter the pain and suffering inflicted on millions of Greeks helpless against the war on their well-being. Make no mistake. What's happening in Greece signifies what's ongoing throughout Europe, America, Canada, and other countries, heading for getting much worse - ending social justice to enrich monied interests more than ever, and at the same time, destroy what remains of democratic rights.
Financial tyranny rules! Varoufakis said dealing with other finance ministers in Brussels was like talking to the wall. His reasoned analysis was ignored. He was unwanted - an annoyance to be humiliated and banished. He "might as well have sung the Swedish national anthem" for all the good it did to present sensible arguments responded to with "blank stares." His involvement accomplished nothing. Deputy Finance Nadia Valavani resigned.
She called the mandated deal Greek agony, saying she was,
"ready to serve in any capacity to the end during challenges." "However, when our delegation returned with liabilities that are 'stillborn measures' and at such a price (demanded by Troika bandits) once again when the dilemma appears of retreating or Grexit, it will be impossible for me to remain a member of the government." "This 'capitulation' is so overwhelming that it will not allow a regrouping of forces. With your signature there will be a deterioration in the status of an already suffering population, and this will be a tombstone around their necks for many years with little potential of redemption."

SYRIZA officials are sharply divided. Stiff opposition denounced Tsipras' betrayal.
Retired Greek diplomat Leonidas Chrysanthopoulos called the deal,
"too tough, too late, the death of Greeks." "These absurd measures do not reflect the EU we entered back in 1981. It has actually made Greece a colony of Germany, not to say of the European Union. (D)espite the concessions the EU has made to Greece, the country is far from being out of the crisis."
SYRIZA coalition partner Independent Greeks leader Panos Kammenos, current defense minister, rejects Troika demands he and other party members "cannot agree with " SYRIZA parliamentary spokesman Nikos Filis said,
"Germany unfortunately for a third time in 100 years is attempting to destroy Europe."
Overwhelming public sentiment opposes harsh Troika demands.
Greek Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis called on Tsipras to reject the deal he agreed to in Brussels.
"Greece had an alternative to the agreement," he said. "The creditors' dilemma: capitulation or destruction is fake. It aims to terrorize and has caused the collapse of popular consciousness. The agreement signed with the institutions is unacceptable and a radical party, such as SYRIZA, does not deserve to be responsible for bringing such an agreement, after fighting to abolish the bailout programs and austerity measures."

He called German and other Eurozone negotiating partners "financial assassins." Perhaps more heads will roll before Greece's parliament votes on Troika demands late Wednesday evening Athens time. Reports indicate Tsipras wants opposition ministers replaced so he can get parliamentary approval of what demands rejection. Around three dozen or more SYRIZA deputies intend voting "no" - including at least two ministers and House Speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou. Sources close to Tsipras say he intends doing whatever it takes to ram through parliament legislation already drafted surrendering to Troika authority. Public anger spilled into streets near parliament demanding rejection of what looks sure to pass. Civil servants and pharmacists called a one-day anti-austerity strike. Betrayed pensioners plan their own demonstration. Part of the deal calls for Greece to hand over 50 billion worth of public assets to a fund controlled by German KfW Bank run by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble - to be sold at fire sale prices. Germany is Europe's economic powerhouse. It dominates Eurozone policy.
