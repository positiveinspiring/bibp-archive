In the last couple of years the omnipresent force known as
Agenda 21 is
meeting with increasing resistance worldwide.
With the rise of the alternative media, the flow
of decade-long propaganda efforts is finally being hindered. As a result of
rocks thrown in the stream - the once steady water flow is now exposing
itself at every turn as its forced to bend and twist its way forward.
Ironically, the UN and its affiliate accomplices have themselves to thank
for the counter-effort.
The internet - as well as some pretty thorough
archiving on the part of these transnational bureaucracies - have allowed
researchers to withdraw information directly from the lions den.
As a result of this development, we can display
a plethora of documents, often written by UN personnel and ideologues, that
prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is a concerted strategy in place
to brainwash (theres no other name for it) the human population of the
planet into accepting Agenda 21 and its inherent depopulation proposals.
Furthermore, this pool of document has revealed
a plan to de-industrialize the west and to use the green agenda to do so.
In the last few decades Agenda 21 has been UN policy, and all of its
subdivisions were commanded to fall in line.
Throwing rocks however, is not enough to stall the multi-winged creature
that is Agenda 21.
What do free people do when confronted with tyranny
designed to target people in their local communities? Methinks nothing short
of a war declaration is in order to push back the effort.
As is custom when declaring war, there first
needs to be a listing of the arguments for the war declared.
Exhibit A
De-Industrializing the West
A 1991 policy paper prepared for the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development (UNCED) by Professor Jeffrey Sachs
outlines a strategy for the transfer of wealth in name of the environment to
be implemented in the course of 35 to 40 years.
As it turns out, it is a
visionary paper describing phase by phase the road to world dictatorship
under Agenda 21.
As the professor states in the paper:
To be meaningful, the strategies should
cover the time-span of several decades. Thirty-five to forty years seems
a good compromise between the need to give enough time to the postulated
transformations and the uncertainties brought about by the lengthening
of the time-span.
In his paper
The Next 40 Years - Transition
Strategies to the Virtuous Green Path - North/South/East/Global, Sachs
accurately describes not only the intended time-span to bring about a global
society, but also what steps should be taken to ensure population
stabilization:
In order to stabilize the populations of
the South by means other than wars or epidemics, mere campaigning for
birth control and distributing of contraceptives has proved fairly
inefficient.
In the first part of the (in retrospect)
bizarrely accurate description of current events as they unfold, Sachs
points out redistribution of wealth is the only viable path towards
population stabilization and - as he calls it - a virtuous green world.
The professor:
The way out from the double bind of poverty
and environmental disruption calls for a fairly long period of more
economic growth to sustain the transition strategies towards the
virtuous green path of what has been called in Stockholm ecodevelopement
and has since changed its name in Anglo-Saxon countries to sustainable
development.
(
) a fair degree of agreement seems to exist, therefore, about the
ideal development path to be followed so long as we do not manage to
stabilize the world population and, at the same time, sharply reduce the
inequalities prevailing today., the professor states.
The bolder the steps taken in the near future, Sachs asserts, the
shorter will be the time span that separates us from a steady state.
Radical solutions must address to the roots of the problem and not to
its symptoms. Theoretically, the transition could be made shorter by
measures of redistribution of assets and income.
Sachs points to the political difficulties of
such proposals being implemented (because free humanity tends to distrust
any national government let alone transnational government to redistribute
its well-earned wealth).
He therefore proposes these measures to be
implemented gradually, following a meticulously planned strategy:
The pragmatic prospect is one of transition
extending itself over several decades.
In the second sub-chapter The Five Dimensions
of Ecodevelopment, professor Sachs sums up the main dimensions of this
carefully outlined move to make Agenda 21 a very real future prospect.
- The
first dimension he touches upon is Social Sustainability:
The aim is to build a civilization of being
within greater equity in asset and income distribution, so as to improve
substantially the entitlements of the broad masses of population and of
reduce the gap in standards of living between the have and the have nots.
This of course means, reducing the standards of
living in The North (U.S., Europe) and upgrading those of the developing
nations (The South and The East).
This would have to be realized through
what Sachs calls Economic Sustainability:
made possible by a more efficient
allocation and management of resources and a steady flow of public and
private investment.
- The third dimension described by the professor
is Ecological Sustainability which, among other things, limits,
the consumption of fossil fuels and other
easily depletable or environmentally harmful products, substituting them
by renewable and/or plentiful and environmentally friendly resources,
reducing the volume of pollutants by means of energy and resource
conservation and recycling and, last but not least, promoting
self-constraint in material consumption on part of the rich countries
and of the privileged social strata all over the world.
In order to make this happen Sachs stresses the
need of,
defining the rules for adequate
environmental protection, designing the institutional machinery and
choosing the mix of economic, legal and administrative instruments
necessary for the implementation of environmental policies.
- Dimension 4: Spatial Sustainability:
directed at achieving a more balanced
rural-urban configuration and a better territorial distribution of human
settlements and economic activities (
).
- The fifth and last dimension described in the UN
policy paper is Cultural Sustainability:
looking for the endogenous roots of the
modernization processes, seeking change within cultural continuity,
translating the normative concept of ecodevelopment into a plurality of
local, ecosystem-specific, culture-specific and site-specific
solutions.
But to realize such a dramatic new direction for
the world, Sachs once again stresses the importance of incremental
implementation.
A matter of boiling the frog slowly as opposed to throwing
the poor animal into a boiling-hot cooking pan:
Even if we know where we want to get, the
operational question is how do we proceed to put humankind on the
virtuous path of genuine development, socially responsible and in
harmony with nature. It is submitted that UNCED 92 should give
considerable attention to the formulation of transition strategies that
could become the central piece of the Agenda 21.
This is the word - Agenda 21: the UN strategy
for redistributing the wealth accumulated by the North in order to create
a completely balanced world society - under auspices of
the United Nations
of course and the private central banks controlling it.
This can only come
about by destroying the middle-class. A sudden redistribution and
industrialization would not do - for the middle-class would undoubtedly rise
in defiance against it.
Therefore, Sachs argues for an incremental and
carefully planned dissolution of the middle-class phase by phase:
To be meaningful, the strategies should
cover the time-span of several decades.
Thirty-five to forty years seems
a good compromise between the need to give enough time to the postulated
transformations and the uncertainties brought about by the lengthening
of the time-span. The retooling of industries, even in periods of rapid
growth, requires ten to twenty years.
The restructuration and the
expansion of the infrastructures requires several decades and this is a
crucially important sector from the point of view of environment.
Then Sachs plunges into his most shocking
statement:
However, the single most important reason
to consider the transition strategies over a minimum of thirty-five to
forty years stems from the non-linearity of these strategies; they
should be devised as a succession of changing priorities over time.
A
good illustration is provided by the population transition. In order to
stabilize the populations of the South by means other than wars or
epidemics, mere campaigning for birth control and distributing of
contraceptives has proved fairly inefficient.
Sachs argues that,
an accelerated program of
social and economic development of the rural areas should be the outmost
priority in the first phase of a realistic population stabilization scheme.
Who or what is to coordinate all this, according to Sachs, and how exactly
is the UN to take control?
The solutions, says Sachs, can vary in
terms of their boldness and take the form of global, multilateral or
bilateral arrangements. These arrangements should as far as Sachs is
concerned ensure at least partially the automacity of financial
transfers by some form of fiscal mechanisms, be it a small income tax or
an array of indirect taxes on goods and services whose production and
consumption has significant environmental impacts.
Over time, gradually, these taxes should
increase:
Starting the operation with a one per ten
thousand tax and increasing it so as to reach one per thousand in ten to
twenty years seems a fairly realistic proposal, the more so that the
scheme creates an interesting market for the private enterprises
involved in R and D.
Reading all this, the question as to what entity
should take charge is not difficult to answer. Sachs:
In order to generate maximum synergies
between the national strategies and global action, the United Nations
should create a forum for the periodical discussion and evaluation of
these strategies and a research, monitoring and flexible planning
facility to put them in a global perspective.(
).
The forum should have
a fair representation of all the main actors involved: governments,
parliaments, citizen movements and the business world. Given its
importance, it should be lifted from specialized agencies to a central
place in the UN system.
This almost literally echoes the recent call by
a group of scientists for the upcoming UN Earth Summit to create,
a Sustainable Development Council within
the UN system to integrate social, economic and environmental policy at
the global level.
The fair representation Sachs is talking about
is of course only a pretext to get everybody on board.
As the Danish Text,
drafted for the Copenhagen conference in late 2009, clearly illustrates, the
IMF and World Bank will always have final say in the construction of any
international system.
The other, more sinister element of Agenda 21 is of course the concerted
effort on the part of the global elite, through multilateral treaties and
regulations, to not only control the populations of the world but to cull
them.
Exhibit B
Using the Mass-Media To Cull the Overall Human Population
The 1973 document
Mass Media, Family Planning and Development: Country Case
Studies on Media Strategy is a good example of how the UN utilizes mass
media to propagandize people into cutting their numbers.
In this particular document we learn something
about the strategies to be implemented in the eugenics-based family planning
project of the future. Based on case studies in third world countries, the
document proposes the creation of a family planning communication resource
unit for every nation concerned.
The reason being, so the report states,
that,
culturally, there is an emphasis on fertility, and the birth of
children to the family is celebrated, as a symbol of prosperity and for
status for women.
Because UNESCO-chieftains cant have that, the reduction
of a population should be accomplished through an elaborate media campaign,
utilizing all possible avenues. Ancient tribal instincts, revolving around
procreation and creativity, become suspect - as does religion and tribal
mythology.
The following strategies dates back from the early 1970s - but
have now been formalized worldwide by Agenda 21 as enshrined within its dark
articles.
The writers of the 1973 document mean not to destroy the human tendencies,
they mean to use them to their own advantage and that of their masters.
The religion, they say, supports the idea
that children are Gods Greatest Blessing but can also be used to
encourage the idea that every child should be given the best
opportunities parents can offer.
There is also a favorable attitude to
economic development, a desire to raise living standards, and a desire
for education. These factors are helpful in the development of a
Preliminary Media Strategy.
A Communication Resource Unit, the document continues, is responsible
for the implementation of media policy for one, or more than one field.
The document proceeds with outlining the functions of such a unit in
regards to family planning messages:
The integration of messages is a
matter which concerns the Communication Resource Unit, in that an
integrated approach to family planning needs to be worked out. (
)
These
(messages) may be family planning for maternal health, family
planning for family prosperity, family planning for your figure,
family planning for national prosperity, family planning for child
development.
These messages will be pretested to find those which seem
to appeal most to the eligible age groups.
One of the many case studies (country case study
nr.1) involves an unnamed small island, total population 3,000,000.
Describing the current situation, the report states:
Mass media approaches to family planning
are wholly financed by the Government and, since 1968, radio, television
and the press have been used to give information about family planning
and to create an awareness of the need for population control.
One of the chief objectives for the resource
unit, will be to,
extend(ing) the family planning coverage to
90% of the eligible population. The aim at this point is to bring the
number of children per family nearer to three rather than four, and to
gradually reduce this to two children per family at a later stage.
As one of the first proposed phases of the
program, the document describes several messages to be embedded within
television commercials.
A couple are shown over one of the new
Government flats. They are unable to take it, because the accommodation
provided is for families with two or three children. Preference is given
to smaller families. They (the large family) will have to wait longer.
Another example:
The picture shows a married woman with one
child. She is stopped by a voice saying Do you know about family
planning?
Your local clinic has all the information.
Or: (Picture
changes to a smiling woman with clinic appearing) Family planning is
free in all clinics (
).
How about this one:
Dont put off family
planning. Tomorrow may be too late. See your clinic today.
You gotta
also love this one:
A picture on the screen could show a woman talking
to a consultant about family planning. She turns to the viewers and
says: Im glad I made up my mind about family planning.
Cartoons, say the authors, could also help
implant a family planning message, for example,
a cartoon in the most widely read newspaper
could take the opportunity to ridicule those who cling to the old ways
to the detriment of their families.
Both television and radio advertisements are
subject to the strategies of the Communication Resource Unit:
Advertising on television will be in the
evenings, between popular programs, when a broader audience (both male
and female) is expected.
With regards to radio advertising, the report
says:
The commercials can be played into record
request programs, womens programs, at program junctions, before and
after news breaks, popular serials and plays. The message should be
simple, sympathetic, catchy.
For example, the report continues, messages like these can appeal
specifically to the over thirty age group: Family planning is for YOU.
Have you had two children or more? The nows the time to visit your
local clinic. And: Most people plan their families. They know that
education, clothing, housing, all cost money. How many children can you
afford?
In another instance, people are being scared with all kinds of
gruesome images:
For example, the commercial might begin with the
hungry cries of four or five children, followed by the tired voice of
the mother. The examples in the document go on and on, crudely
distributing messages into the mass media: A sequence might be set up,
(
) showing John and Mary with two children." The caption reads: John
and Mary
. nice house
lovely children, and another (showing another
couple with four children), Doris and Jack
.. no house
.. too many
children.
Personality shows, the report mentions, can be useful in the
reinforcement phase. (
) A well known personality who demonstrates an
interest in family planning, or remarks on the success of the campaign,
can often add credibility to the family planning message.
The report
would like to see these personalities follow the script word for word,
for example in response to a woman, who recently gave birth to her first
child:
Well, thats marvelous, the radio personality should respond,
Congratulations Mrs
I suppose you wont be having any more children for
a bit. You want that boy of yours to grow healthy and strong and I know
you need time to recover - Children take up a lot of your time, dont
they?
The document states that personality alone cannot fully carry the
message through to the listening audience:
Jingles and spot
announcements, jokes and quick comments, can be included in the
programs, which will then have the effect of keeping the subject of
family planning firmly in mind.
How would the UNESCO-people arrange all this?
Just by voluntary compliance of the media-people involved?
There may be some scheme whereby those
people will be paid for their work (
) - says the document.
In other words: bribery is being proposed as an
acceptable means of bringing the media into the strategy.
Also community plays should be used to convey the message:
The afternoon play can carry the theme,
skillfully woven into the story. It is possible that some plays could be
specially written for the purpose, but it is probable that the message
can be incorporated into plays by those writers who have been briefed
well enough in advance.
Music and pamphlets are another way of doing it,
the report says:
Songs can be useful in this phase, (
).
They must be professionally composed and recorded, and the messages must
be reasonably subtle if it is to be acceptable to programmers.
But the proposed Resource Unit wont restrict
itself to just radio, TV and plays.
Feature films are considered perhaps to
be the most effective tools in conveying the message to unsuspecting
audiences:
(
) There are two ways in which the family
planning message can be included in feature films. The first is for the
family organization to commission a film specifically for the campaign.
(
) if it is to be successful, well known and popular actors must be
chosen, and the scripting and direction has to be professionally
executed.
Another method is for the family planning theme to be
introduced into feature films which are already planned and prepared by
local commercial production companies. In this case, the family planning
organizers must be aware of the possible ways in which the theme can be
subtly incorporated, as producers are not likely to respond to a
suggestion which involves the total re-thinking of the plot. (
)
Suitable opportunities can be found in love stories, in stories based on
conflicts between men and women (
).
And the document - thoroughly immersed in
deception - continues on, listing example after example - and illustrating
quite vividly the willingness on the part of the Malthusian-minded elite to
lie, cheat and deceive in order to convince people that less is more.
In the 1970s, air pollution and global cooling
were thrown into the equation - later on it became anthropogenic global
warming.
As this document shows, nation after nation is
methodically bombarded with predictive programming-propaganda, requiring of
the receiver an almost superhuman set of defence mechanisms to fence off the
pitchforks of the eugenicists, poking at them from all sides.
Exhibit C
Declaring Man The Enemy of the Earth
As we know, the globalists have decided long ago that the environmental
debate is no longer a debate - it has been decreed that the discussion is
over and everyone should better realize that man is the prime cause for
global warming on the planet earth, or of any other natural calamity.
As long as it serves the double purpose of the
elite:
to abolish nation-states in favor of a great
global government, and - as Jeffrey Sachs 1991 document reveals -
reduce the world population in the same breath.
The imagined threat of international terrorism
hardly being sufficient to justify the drastic measures being implemented,
another common enemy has presented itself, and what better enemy than the
one staring back at you in the mirror.
As numerous meteorologists and climatologists have testified to in recent
years, their participation in the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change has been used to back a theory that they themselves did not support.
And then there are the thousands of meteorologists of good name and
standard, who out of scientific righteousness have stepped forward and
presented their facts before the public and scientific community.
But it is of no concern to the global elite.
They have for a good long time, spanning the
last couple of centuries at least, presided over the politics of eugenics
and enforced its diabolical mechanisms with energy, cunning and precision.
It is not an idle use of words, when we identify eugenicists as such, for
however just and noble its cloaking makes them out to be, this supposed
righteousness is merely a grotesque carnival-costume intended to shade its
true countenance.
For an October 1975 International Workshop on Environmental Education,
UN-representative Lars Emmelin writes:
The adult education effort seems to
me most critical. First, because this element - now outside the formal
channels of education - will continue to be the decision makers for the next
15 to 20 years, and it is within this period that the most critical and
disruptive decisions will have to be made.
We cannot afford to focus on
youth and let the elders die off before changing our course, which, if time
permitted, would be the most efficient way of institutions change.
In choosing its course for mass-indoctrination, the 1975 workshop explores
various ways in which the mass media can be used to sensitize the general
public in accepting the UNs long-term ambitions.
Under the headline The
Media as Environmental Educators (page 4) several options are being
presented by one of the participants in how the media can best be used:
Discussing the role of media as motivators
Sandman concludes that: Four relatively effective kinds of
environmental information are: basic ecological principles;
prescriptions for environmental action; early warnings of anticipated
problems; and assessments of blame for environmental degradation., the
report states.
During an
UNESCO-conference in October 1977 held
(bizarrely) in Soviet Russia, the Director-General of UNESCO, Amadou-Mahtar
MBow,
paid tribute to the Soviet Union and to the
spectacular results achieved since the October Revolution in all areas
of economic, social and cultural life, particularly in education and
science, and, more especially, in environmental education.
Youre reading it right. Here the good
Director-General is paying tribute to a then 60-year old regime responsible
for murdering many millions of its own people in death camps and deliberate
mass-scale starvation-operations.
Yes, environmental issues were very high
on the agenda of the USSR, very high indeed.
After having taken his hat off to his fellow-psychopath, the
Director-General plunged into a long and melodious speech on the importance
of the environment-issue in the decades to come:
The objectives and strategies relating to
the environment and to development had to be linked and coordinated. (
)
It would be the task of education to make people aware of their
responsibilities in this connection, but in order to do so it must first
be reoriented and based on an ethos of the environment
And a little
further on he states:
Environmental education should also promote
attitudes which would encourage individuals to discipline themselves in
order not to impair the quality of the environment and to play a
positive role in improving it.
It is true, under the intentionally vague
environment-umbrella one can assemble all kinds of calamities and as many
solutions to combat them.
Work in this program area, the report
continues, will be intensified in the line of the conferences
recommendations and move into a more operational phase.
This means,
among other activities, making aid from UNESCO available to member
states (of the UN) which would like to launch pilot projects;
considering a bank of experts on environmental education; augmenting
work in the exchange of experience, in training and in encouraging the
production of teaching materials; and strengthening the Secretariat and
UNESCOs infrastructure in general for the increased promotion of
environmental education..
In the meeting, the chairman of the conference
stressed that no means must or will be shunned in the coming propaganda war
against the people:
Some countries have also taken an interest,
as part of in-service training activities, in the environmental
education of various social and occupational categories of the
population, such as factory workers, farmers, civil servants, etc.
Marked progress has been made in the preparation of audio-visual and
printed teaching materials concerning the environment, and the mass
media are being increasingly used for sensitizing and informing broad
sectors of the public about the environment.
In a
follow-up conference more than ten years
later (this time in Moscow) the Secretary-General of UNESCO, Federico Mayor,
discusses three levels of global education in regards to the environment.
-
The first, he states, is the moral
imperative to reach as many people as humanly possible.
-
The second level is to harness school
systems, non-formal learning and informal education to teach and
learn about the global issues that shape and threaten the quality of
our lives.
-
Arriving at the third and last level of
global indoctrination, Mayor states:
-
The third level concerns the means
at our disposal to project a global reach for education through
both simple and highly advanced existing technologies. (
) the
daily newspaper and radio have a crucial role to play in
building bridges to the wider world. We must promote these
media, defend and expand their freedom and appeal to their
professionals at all levels to work with us for global
education.
We can hardly accuse the globalists of keeping
their plans in the dark. At every possible UN event or brainstorm
conference, they openly brag about their plans for the world in quite
explicit ways.
The Secretary-General continues about the steps
that have to be taken in order to build a new global perception:
Our first initiative would be to create a
worldwide expert panel of scientists and educators to plan a global
education curriculum of practical value and planetary scope.
The Secretary-General forgets to mention here
that just such a panel was created two years earlier by the very
organization he presided over.
Second, putting environmental education at
the center of all curricula from kindergarten to higher studies and
training the teachers and the administrators who can carry the massage
into all schools.(..)
Third, promoting a global civic education by
devising teaching methods and materials that emphasize the ethics of
worldwide community living.(
)
Fourth, teaching the children of the
wealthier countries about the conditions of their brothers and sisters
in the developing world (
)
Fifth, working with the mass media and
telecommunication enterprises to produce and broadcast audio-visual
packages that introduce audiences, particularly children and young
people, to the great teachers of this world at al levels and in all
cultures (
).
And finally, the Secretary-General concludes, let me make a very
immediate and concrete proposal: building on the broadcast of this forum
scheduled for tomorrow (
), to create global television learning
networks on the issues of the human agenda for the next century. This
would be an experiment in informal global education at its best.
Under the term Information Repackaging, the UN
has published several manuals on this subject, teaching their cronies how to
most effectively influence public opinion.
In a 1986
Manual for Repackaging of Information
on Population Education, the UNESCO proposes strategies for integrating
population education into different subject areas - one of these being
playing into fears on the part of the population in regards to the subject
of their home environment family:
For instance, the effectiveness of fear
appeals in changing attitudes and behavior, such as the adverse effects
of non - or limited access to education and housing facilities with more
than two children, depends on the credibility of the source of
information and the extent of general/public support to the message
conveyed by a particular piece of information.
Fear appeals directed to the welfare of
people valued by the receiver of information (e.g. family members, close
friends) are also effective.
On page 37 of the manual, under the header
Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI), the strategy is further
elaborated upon:
One SDI package, for instance, focuses on
the integration of population education into environmental education.
The package contains materials which will help users understand the
relationship between man and the environment, as well as provide
insights and actual data on how to plan, teach and implement practical
environment/population activities for everyday life.
As we know, the above mentioned gadgets and
gimmicks are being incrementally used in the mass media as the climate
change propaganda machine is working overtime.
Using the mass media to prepare the population
for globalist supreme rule is not only an ambitious plan - it reveals the
deceitful spirit behind the provided information, rivaling the work of
Joseph Goebbels and his Department of Propaganda.
A
March 2009 policy brief by the United Nations Population Division reveals
that the long-term plan for worldwide population reduction is not going fast
enough according to the social engineers, not by a long shot.
Under the desperate headline What would it take
to accelerate fertility decline in the least developed countries? this
particular policy brief gives an overview of the progress made by developing
countries in regards to the globalists set goal of reducing population and
proposes several ways of speeding up the death.
Richly draped with graphic illustrations on the
state of global population and the progress made by the UN to bring back
fertility to acceptable levels, the policy brief advises an increased
effort on the part of governments to commit to a strict family planning -
policy and other measures designed to bring a halt to life.
The reduction of fertility could be
accelerated if effective measures were taken to satisfy the existing
unmet need for family planning.
After these recommendations, the authors plunge
into a long, wailing lament about the slow progress of the desired culling
of the population.
They also blame a lack of commitment of the governments
concerned and, as expected, they stress the need for a global intervention
in order to avoid certain destruction.
This recent policy brief was just one out of many in regards to the
long-term plan by the elite to significantly bring down the numbers of the
existing earth population.
From the moment the Rockefeller funded family
planning-machine was widely kicked off in the 1960s and 70s, numerous
meetings have been held in the last couple of decades where various
strategies were discussed to implement population-reduction on as large a
scale as possible.
The strategies in question were especially
directed towards the third world as the globalists had virtual carte blanche
in the impoverished developing countries. The famous 1994 population
conference in Cairo, held in the wake of Agenda 21′s formal kick-off,
outlined some of the proposed strategies to be implemented.
Then Secretary-General of the UN, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali in his
opening statement on the International Conference on
Population and Development, stated that:
I am not exaggerating when I say that not
only does the future of the human society depend on this Conference but
also the efficacy of the economic order of the planet on which we live.
During a follow-up-meeting held in New York on
December 1994, the United Nations participants came up with some practical
solutions to the population problem - one of which is the integration of
population issues with matters of environment and human development:
Several priority areas were identified that
needed immediate action by the participants. These included creation of
awareness of the interrelationships between environment, population and
development; advocacy; education; training; population management;
gender concerns; monitoring and evaluation; and information
dissemination and networking.
Under the headline Youth NGOs Agree to
Integrate Environment and Population Issues in their Activities were
mentioned the following activities to guide the young into the right
mindset by, again, mixing in environmental issues with population issues:
Among the current issues identified by the
Working Group as requiring priority attention were the problems dealing
with population, environment and sustainable development.
Hence, a
Working Group Meeting of the Regional Consultation of Youth NGOs in Asia
and the Pacific was held from 19-21 April 1995 at the UNESCO PROAP to
discuss and shape a plan of action integrating issues on environment,
population and development for consideration by the youth NGOs. (
)
To help them develop a relevant plan of
action, the participants were exposed and sensitized to the current
policies and programs adopted by FAO, UNEP, UNFPA, and UNESCO in the
areas of population, environment and development.
Further on the use of mass-media is being
proposed as effective carriers of population-information to hammer
dehumanization into the collective consciousness:
With more than 2 billion radios in the
world, roughly one for every three people, and growing number of
televisions, the electronic media plays an increasingly important and
influential role in building awareness of population and other
development issues.
The report continues with a prime example of
predictive programming:
Radio and television soap operas featuring
family planning themes, popular songs on population-related issues, and
phone-in question-and-answer sessions have all had an impact in
different countries. The use of such media can be very important where
literacy is low or where written information is not widely circulated.
A TV soap opera series is credited with
bringing thousands to family planning clinics in Mexico, and night-time
drama series integrating family planning themes have proved successful
in Egypt, Nigeria and Turkey.
In a January 1994
preparation meeting for the
Cairo conference called Family Planning Communications Strategies Examined
it was discussed how best to use the media in order to create tolerance
among the general public and,
how attitudes and beliefs could be changed
through the innovative use of traditional and mass media.
The meeting featured case studies and presentations by communication
practitioners and covered a wide range of subjects, such as: the use of
folk tradition and drama to organize community action in Egypt; the use
of micro-communications to encourage acceptance of family planning in
the Philippines; the use of traditional and modern media in Ghana; and
the use of songs to propagate family planning messages in Latin America.
The success in India and Mexico of radio and television soap operas and
films on family planning subjects was also discussed.
During the meeting the Executive Coordinator of
the ICPD, Jyoti Shankar Singh, stressed the importance of using mass media
to convey family planning and reproductive health messages:
Electronic media, print media (and)
interpersonal interventions were all part of the kind of comprehensive
information, education and communication (IEC) strategies we need in
pursuit of population goals.
In another technical report
Guidelines on Basic
Education with special attention to Gender Disparities for the UN Resident
Coordinator System the message is repeatedly conveyed that:
It is important that information be
disseminated through various channels including traditional means and
packaged in various forms to allow both literate and illiterate persons
to understand the key messages.
In 1997 the
UNFPA organized a Regional Media
Seminar on Population and Development for the role of the mass media in
(euphemistically called) Information Repackaging for the Pacific islands.
The UN officials boasted on the success of the
seminar:
The seminar brought together journalists in
the print and radio media from 9 countries of the South Pacific to
explore both the role and potential of mass media as a vehicle for
population advocacy, information, education and communication. (
) The
seminar explored the role of the media in developing and packaging
population materials for identified target groups.
The meeting also provided development
partners with an opportunity to forge networks with media personnel and
develop effective strategies to better address population and
development goals and accelerate the implementation of the ICPD
(International Conference on Population and Development) Program of
Action.
In other words: every possible resource should
be utilized for propagandizing different target audiences.
But the people burdened with designing and
implementing population education on a large scale emphasized the need for a
common tongue and sequence of arguments with which the different
UN-divisions sell the people on the idea of dehumanization.
Mr. Michael Vlassoff, Senior Technical
Officer, Technical and Evaluation Division, UNFPA, introduced the work
of the Working Group on Policy-Related Issues.
He explained that the
Working Group had decided to address the common advocacy concern by
drawing up a Statement of Commitment that would then be issued by all
agencies and organizations involved in the IATF.
The aim of such a
statement would be to ensure that all UN agencies and organizations use
the same language regarding population and development issues.
The report goes on to list these arguments with
which populations worldwide should be lured into embracing modern-day
eugenics as a sensible policy:
The Statement of Commitment on Population
and Development by the United Nations System, drafted by the Working
Group, is divided into three sections: a general introduction stressing
the commitment by the UN agencies and organizations to implement ICPD
(International Conference on Population and Development); a section on
the linkages between population issues and other development issues; and
a concluding section calling for global partnership in addressing these
interrelated issues.
In short - in the early 1970s UNESCO laid the
groundwork for Agenda 21′s future propaganda-campaigns.
A large part of the 1990s was occupied with a
coordinated mobilization of mass media for propaganda purposes by the global
elite, a test case so to speak, before implementing the same strategies
worldwide in the first decades of the 21st century.
The great global warming swindle then was put
into action, arriving just in time as the environmental issue to attach the
basic message to: there are too many of us - and our numbers should be
reduced before the planet is destroyed.
Because the warming is global, the
response should be so as well. However eloquently the message may be
presented by hopelessly compliant media outlets, it is the tyrants voice we
discern amidst the chatter - and all with ears to hear should educate their
neighbor in this all-out information war.
Lets not forget what the elite who have funded
the UN from the moment of its very conception have always aspired.
In the
words of the aristocratic fiend Prince Philip:
If I were reincarnated, I would wish to be
returned to earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.
The killer virus into which the prince would
like to see himself incarnated, is
Agenda 21.
War has been declared on mankind. It is high
time mankind declares war right back on them.
