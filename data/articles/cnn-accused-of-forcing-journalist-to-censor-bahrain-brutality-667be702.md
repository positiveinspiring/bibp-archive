# CNN Accused of Forcing Journalist to Censor Bahrain Brutality

In late March 2011, as the Arab Spring was
spreading, CNN sent a four-person crew to Bahrain to produce a one-hour
documentary on the use of internet technologies and social media by
democracy activists in the region.
Featuring on-air investigative correspondent
Amber Lyon, the CNN team had a very eventful eight-day stay in that
small, US-backed kingdom.
By the time the CNN crew arrived, many of
the sources who had agreed to speak to them were either in hiding or had
disappeared. Regime opponents whom they interviewed suffered
recriminations, as did ordinary citizens who worked with them as fixers.
Leading human rights activist Nabeel Rajab was
charged with crimes shortly after speaking to the CNN team.
A doctor who gave the crew a tour of his
village and arranged meetings with government opponents, Saeed Ayyad,
had his house burned to the ground shortly after. Their local fixer
was fired ten days after working with them.
The CNN crew itself was violently detained
by regime agents in front of Rajab's house.
As
they described it after returning to the US,
"20 heavily-armed men",
whose faces were "covered with black ski masks", "jumped from military
vehicles", and then "pointed machine guns at" the journalists, forcing
them to the ground.
The regime's security forces seized their
cameras and deleted their photos and video footage, and then detained
and interrogated them for the next six hours.
Lyon's experience both shocked and
emboldened her.
The morning after her detention, newspapers in Bahrain
prominently featured articles about the incident containing what she
said were "outright fabrications" from the government.
"It made clear just how willing the
regime is to lie," she told me in a phone interview last week.
But she also resolved to expose just how
abusive and thuggish the regime had become in attempting to snuff out
the burgeoning democracy movement, along with any negative coverage of
the government.
"I realized there was a correlation
between the amount of media attention activists receive and the
regime's ability to harm them, so I felt an obligation to show the
world what our sources, who risked their lives to talk to us, were
facing."
CNN's total cost for the documentary,
ultimately titled "iRevolution: Online Warriors of the Arab Spring", was
in excess of $100,000, an unusually high amount for a one-hour program
of this type.
The portion Lyon and her team produced on
Bahrain ended up as a 13-minute segment in the documentary.
That segment, is a hard-hitting and unflinching piece of reporting that
depicts the regime in a very negative light.

the March 2011 repression in Bahrain
In the segment, Lyon interviewed activists
as they explicitly described their torture at the hands of government
forces, while family members recounted their relatives' abrupt
disappearances.
She spoke with government officials justifying the
imprisonment of activists. And the segment featured harrowing video
footage of regime forces shooting unarmed demonstrators, along with the
mass arrests of peaceful protesters.
In sum, the early 2011 CNN segment
on Bahrain presented one of the starkest reports to date of the brutal
repression embraced by the US-backed regime.
On 19 June 2011 at 8pm, CNN's domestic
outlet in the US aired "iRevolution" for the first and only time. The
program received prestigious journalism awards, including a
2012 Gold Medal from New York Festival's Best TV and Films.
Lyon, along with her segment producer Taryn
Fixel, were
named as finalists for the 2011 Livingston Awards for Young
Journalists. A Facebook
page created by Bahraini activists, entitled "Thank you Amber Lyon,
CNN reporter | From people of Bahrain", received more than 8,000
"likes".
Despite these accolades, and despite the
dangers their own journalists and their sources endured to produce it,
CNN International (CNNi) never broadcast the documentary. Even in the
face of numerous inquiries and complaints from their own employees
inside CNN, it continued to refuse to broadcast the program or even
provide any explanation for the decision.
To date, this documentary has never aired on
CNNi.
CNNi's refusal to broadcast
'iRevolution'
It is CNN International that is, by far, the
most-watched English-speaking news outlet in the Middle East.
By
refusing to broadcast "iRevolution", the network's executives ensured it
was never seen on television by Bahrainis or anyone else in the region.
CNNi's decision not to broadcast "iRevolution"
was extremely unusual. Both CNN and CNNi have had severe budget
constraints imposed on them over the last several years.
One long-time
CNN employee (to whom I have granted anonymity to avoid repercussions
for negative statements about CNN's management) described "iRevolution"
as an,
"expensive, highly produced international story about the Arab
Spring".
Because the documentary was already paid for
by CNN, it would have been "free programming" for CNNi to broadcast,
making it "highly unusual not to air it".
The documentary "was made with an
international audience as our target", said Lyon. None of it was
produced on US soil. And its subject matter was squarely within the crux
of CNN International's brand.
CNNi's refusal to broadcast "iRevolution"
soon took on the status of a mini-scandal among its producers and
reporters, who began pushing Lyon to speak up about this decision.
In June 2011, one long-time CNN news
executive emailed Lyon:
"Why would CNNi not run a documentary on
the Arab Spring, arguably the the biggest story of the decade?
Strange, no?"
Motivated by the concerns expressed by
long-time CNN journalists, Lyon requested a meeting with CNNi's
president, Tony Maddox, to discuss the refusal to broadcast the
documentary.
On 24 June 2011, she met with Maddox, who
vowed to find out and advise her of the reasons for its non-airing. He
never did.
In a second meeting with Maddox, which she
had requested in early December to follow up on her unanswered inquiry,
Lyon was still given no answers. Instead, at that meeting, Maddox,
according to Lyon, went on the offense, sternly warning her not to speak
publicly about this matter.
Several times, Maddox questioned her about
this 18 November 2011 tweet by New York Times columnist Nicholas
Kristof, demanding to know what prompted it:
When I asked CNN to comment on Maddox's
meetings with Lyon, they declined to respond on specific details and
said he was not available for interview.
Instead, they made the following statement:
"The documentary 'iRevolution' was
commissioned for CNN US. While the program did not air in full on
CNN International, segments of it were shown. This differing use of
content is normal across our platforms, and such decisions are taken
for purely editorial reasons.
CNN International has run more than 120
stories on Bahrain over the past six months, a large number of which
were critical in tone and all of which meet the highest journalistic
standards."
Despite Lyon's being stonewalled by CNNi,
she said facts began emerging that shined considerable light on the
relationship between the regime in Bahrain and CNNi when it came to "iRevolution".
Upon returning from Bahrain in April, Lyon
appeared on CNN (above video) several times to recount her own detention by
security forces and to
report on ongoing brutality (below video) by the regime against its own citizens,
even including doctors and nurses providing medical aid to
protesters.
She said, she did not want to wait for the documentary's
release to alert the world to what was taking place.
In response, according to both the
above-cited CNN employee and Lyon, the regime's press officers
complained repeatedly to CNNi about Lyon generally and specifically her
reporting for "iRevolution".
In April, a senior producer emailed her to
say:
"We are dealing with blowback from
Bahrain govt on how we violated our mission, etc."
"It became a standard joke around the
office: the Bahrainis called to complain about you again," recounted
Lyon.
Lyon was also told by CNN employees stationed in the region
that,
"the Bahrainis also sent delegations to our Abu Dhabi bureau to
discuss the coverage."
Internal CNN emails reflect continuous
pressure on Lyon and others to include claims from the Bahraini regime
about the violence in their country - even when, says Lyon, she knew
first-hand that the claims were false.
One April 2011 email to Lyon from a CNN
producer demands that she include in her documentary a line stating
that,
"Bahrain's foreign minister says
security forces are not firing on unarmed civilians," and another
line describing regime claims accusing "activists like Nabeel Rajab
of doctoring photos
fabricating injuries".
Having just returned from Bahrain, Lyon says
she,
"saw first-hand that these regime claims
were lies, and I couldn't believe CNN was making me put what I knew
to be government lies into my reporting."
Bahrain's PR offensive
As negative news stories of its brutal
repression grew in the wake of the Arab Spring, the regime undertook a
massive, very well-funded PR campaign to improve its image.
As
reported by Bahrain
Watch, the regime has spent more than $32m in PR fees alone since
the commencement of the Arab Spring in February, 2011, including
payments to some of Washington, DC's most well-connected firms and
long-time political operatives, such as
former
Howard Dean campaign manager Joe Trippi.
One of the largest contracts the regime had
was with the
DC-based PR firm Qorvis Communications.
As
Time reported last November, the firm, which also does extensive PR
work for Bahrain's close allies, the Saudi regime,
"has a branch dedicated to
rehabilitating the reputation of unsavory governments, a niche
practice that has seen great demand in the wake of the Arab spring".
Qorvis often led the way in complaining to
CNNi about its Bahrain coverage.
An internal email from CNN at the beginning
of 2012, seen by the Guardian, records the firm's calling to complain
about excessively favorable mentions of Nabeel Rajab, who had been
arrested and charged over an anti-regime tweet, and was just this month
sentenced to three years in prison for an "illegal demonstration".
The long-time CNN employee said that "iRevolution"
was vetted far more heavily than the typical documentary:
"Because Amber was relatively new in
reporting on the region, and especially because of the vocal
complaints from the Bahrainis, the documentary was heavily
scrutinized.
But nobody could ever point to anything factually or
journalistically questionable in Amber's reporting on Bahrain."
In response to several inquiries, Bahrain's
Information Affairs Authority refused to say whether they had complained
to CNNi about Lyon and "iRevolution".
A spokesman, Fahad A AlBinali, instead
offered only a generic statement that,
"on occasion we contact media
outlets to provide correct information or a balanced view of the
subject," and, he claimed, when doing so, they are simply trying "to
help ensure that coverage of Bahrain is accurate and unbiased".
Subsequent attempts to obtain specific
answers from the authority about the regime's complaints to CNNi about "iRevolution"
and Lyon went unanswered.
After Lyon's crew returned from Bahrain, CNN
had no correspondents regularly reporting on the escalating violence. In
emails to her producers and executives, Lyon repeatedly asked to return
to Bahrain.
Her requests were denied, and she was never
sent back.
She thus resorted to improvising coverage by
interviewing activists via Skype (below video) in an attempt, she said,
"to keep
Bahrain in the news".
In March 2012, Lyon was
laid off from CNN as part of an unrelated move by the network to
outsource its investigative documentaries. Now at work on a book,
Lyon began in August to make reference to "iRevolution" on her Twitter
account, followed by more than 20,000 people.
On 16 August, Lyon
wrote
three
tweets
about this episode. CNNi's refusal to broadcast "iRevolution", she
wrote, "baffled producers".
Linking to the YouTube clip of the Bahrain
segment, she added that the,
"censorship was devastating to my crew
and activists who risked lives to tell [the] story."
She
posted a picture of herself with Rajab and wrote:
"A proponent of peace, @nabeelrajab
risked his safety to show me how the regime oppresses the [people]
of #Bahrain."
The following day, a representative of CNN's
business affairs office called Lyon's acting agent, George Arquilla
of Octagon Entertainment, and threatened that her severance payments and
insurance benefits would be immediately terminated if she ever again
spoke publicly about this matter, or spoke negatively about CNN.
When I asked CNN specifically about this
alleged threat delivered to Lyon's agent, the company declined to
confirm or deny it, commenting:
"In common with other companies we do
not discuss internal personnel matters."
Responding to Lyon's charge of censorship,
CNN's spokesman replied:
"CNN International has a proud record of
courageous, independent and honest reporting from around the world.
Any suggestion that the network's relationship with any country has
influenced our reporting is wholly and demonstrably wrong."
It is true that CNNi can point to numerous
recent reports describing the violence against protesters by the regime
in Bahrain.
Given the scope of the violence, and how
widely it has now been reported elsewhere, it would be virtually
impossible for CNNi never to broadcast such reports while still
maintaining any claim to credibility. But such reports required far more
journalistic courage to air in the first half of 2011, when so few knew
of the brutality to which the regime had resorted, than now, when it is
widely known.
Moreover, CNNi's reports on the violence in
Bahrain take a much more muted tone than
when it reports on regimes disfavored by the US, such as Iran or
Syria.
More importantly, the tidal wave of CNNi's
partnerships and associations with the regime in Bahrain, and the
hagiography it has broadcast about it (see the
accompanying commentary on the relationship between the network and the
regime), appear to have overwhelmed any truly critical coverage.
But CNN's threat had the opposite effect to
what was intended.
Lyon insists she never signed any
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement with CNN in any case, but
she is sanguine about any risk to her severance package.
"At this point," Lyon said, "I look at
those payments as dirty money to stay silent. I got into journalism
to expose, not help conceal, wrongdoing, and I'm not willing to keep
quiet about this any longer, even if it means I'll lose those
payments."
