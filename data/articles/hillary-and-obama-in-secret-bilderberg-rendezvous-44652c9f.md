According to news reports, Barack Obama
and Hillary Clinton went out of their way to hold their long-awaited
private meeting in a very specific location - not at Hillary's mansion in
Washington - but in Northern Virginia, which also just happens to be the
scene of the 2008 Bilderberg meeting.
Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs told the media that Obama and
Clinton held a private meeting last night but he refused to disclose
where it taken place, except that it was not at Clinton's home in
Washington, as had been widely reported.
Hillary campaign managers also refused to
disclose the location of the rendezvous.
"Reporters traveling with Obama sensed
something might be happening between the pair when they arrived at
Dulles International Airport after an event in Northern Virginia and
Obama was not aboard the airplane," reports the Associated Press.
Dulles just happens to be walking distance from
the Westfields Marriott hotel in Chantilly where
Henry Kissinger,
David Rockefeller and the rest of
the Bilderberg globalists are convening.
"Asked at the time about the Illinois
senator's whereabouts, Gibbs smiled and declined to comment," the
reports adds.
What is the only political "event" taking place
in Northern Virginia at the moment? The Bilderberg Group meeting of course.
Rather than taking the easier option of meeting
at Clinton's Washington mansion, Obama and Hillary went out of their way to
grace the Bilderberg elitists with their presence.
The neo-liberal website
Wonkette, which had previously ridiculed "conspiracy
theorists" for ascribing power to Bilderberg, seemed to take a somewhat
different tone when it made the connection between Obama and Hillary's
meeting and the Bilderberg Group.
"Guess
who had a very private talky-talk in (maybe) romantic
Northern Virginia tonight, probably at the Bilderberg Group meeting in
Chantilly? Your Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton!," states the blog.
"They really met and talked, in private,
Thursday night. And really, it sounds like they did this at that creepy
Bilderberg Group meeting, which is happening now, and which is so secret
that nobody will admit theyre going, even though everybody who is
anybody goes to Bilderberg."
To have the potential future President and
Vice-President of America attend a conference that debunkers have dismissed
as a mere talking shop for old white men once again underscores the real
influence that Bilderberg enjoys.
Not one U.S.
corporate media outlet has made the
connection between the location of the Bilderberg Group conference this year
and Obama and Hillary's decision to venture out to Chantilly for their
confidential "tet a tet".
Not one U.S. corporate media outlet has yet uttered one word about 125 of
the world's most influential power brokers meeting behind closed doors to
discuss the future of the planet on U.S. soil - while being met by the
probable future President of the United States.
Both Hillary and Obama have deep rooted connections to the Bilderberg
elitists.
Bill Clinton attended the 1991 meeting in Germany shortly before becoming
President and he attended again in 1999 when the conference was held in
Sintra, Portugal (despite Clinton's lie that he had not attended in 15
years).
Hillary herself was rumored to have attended the 2006 meeting in Ottawa,
Canada.
As we reported last month, Bilderberg luminary and top corporate elitist
James A. Johnson will select Democratic candidate Barack Obama's
running mate for the 2008 election and in turn potentially act as kingmaker
for America's future President.
Johnson also selected John Kerry's running mate John Edwards in 2004 after
Edwards had impressed Bilderberg elitists Henry Kissinger and David
Rockefeller with a speech he gave at the globalist confab in Italy that
year.
Johnson, who attended last year's Bilderberg meeting in Turkey, is a
representative for Friends of Bilderberg, an offshoot group that
organizes Bilderberg's annual meeting.
Hillary and Obama's attendance of the 2008 Bilderberg meeting, and the
complete failure of the mainstream media to report on the fact, once again
betrays the super-secretive nature and influential reputation that the
54-year-old organization still maintains.
