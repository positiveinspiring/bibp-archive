Since these two guys are actors, can't
they get better actors to debate?
-
Since these two guys are gangsters,
can't they get Tony Soprano to square off against Sonny Corleone?
That would give us some fabulous TV viewing.
I tried watching the debate. I got so bogged down in numbers I gave up.
"No, it's not the 600 percent added on to
the rebate on the other tax, it's the minus 40 percent, and then you
divide by 2, not 3. And that's what I've been saying since day one."
"Well, if you divide by 2, the figures don't match up to what happened
to my grandmother."
The postmortem media reaction was, of course,
all about performance.
The pundits were schoolteachers in a public
speaking class.
"You looked down at the podium. You didn't
stand straight. You were slumping. You have to keep your shoulders back
and your head level. Try to smile more. Never look at your hands. The
moderator is your friend. Don't interrupt him..."
The country is falling apart, the economy is
taking hits from all sides, the food supply is brimming with GMOs, the US is
fighting covert wars all over the Middle East, crime in the streets is
spreading, the surveillance state is recording everything that moves, the
FED is printing money like it's toilet paper, but... Obama kept looking down
at the podium, that's the takeaway from the debate.
The stretch I watched was two accountants trying to figure out how to cook
the books.
I would have preferred matching clips of Romney water-skiing versus Obama
shooting hoops on the White House lawn.
Here are a couple of the incisive after-debate poll questions from CBS and
CNN:
Caring about my needs and problems? What the
hell does the president have to do with my needs and problems? I need the
dissolution of the two American political parties. My problem is they're
actually one party with two heads.
Perform better than I expected? I expected both of them would be
mind-numbing, and they exceeded even Dr. Phil.
The psychology of elections boils down to something simple. If people see
two guys in suits disagreeing about something, people think what they're
disagreeing about must be important. That's it. That's all you have to know.
That's how you stage politics. The real issues and the real crimes are
buried, because the candidates agree on what they're supposed to argue about
up front.
They won't take questions,
...on a host of other issues.
They'll skirt all that.
They'll fiddle while Rome burns.
You want a
Monsanto president?
Elect either Obama or Romney. Facts show
both men are in the pocket of that heinous corporation.
CBS, NBC, and ABC accentuate "performance" in the debates. FOX slams Obama;
MSNBC slams Romney. CNN tries to look neutral while supporting Obama. It's
all for show. Nobody dares say both candidates (and thus both political
parties) are disasters. That would derail the ratings of the stage play.
That would blow the ongoing cover-up.
During the run-up to every presidential election since 1980, I have heard
people say that THAT ELECTION was the most important in history, and a
failure to vote would be treasonous.
That's because engendering fear is the primary
way to keep the population locked into two-party electoral politics. In
every election season, there is always some "overriding issue" that demands
picking sides. There is always a new disaster, a new crisis.
In that sense, the purpose of the election is not to solve the crisis; the
crisis is generated to make the election seem vital.
The best after-debate comment of the night was delivered
by Al Gore...
Obama coming to Denver at the last moment, Al
opined, could have created, at that altitude, a brain oxygen deficit. On
this basis alone, if Obama is reelected, Al should win the directorship of
the Dept. of Health and Human Services.
Speaking of brain cells, any American with at least two functioning cells
should realize that the road to the presidency, coming up through the
two-party system, means any puppet who gains the job is a lowest common
denominator. It's not just about party, either. It's about the men who
control the parties.
The Rockefeller types who run the whole show
delight in superficial presidential thinkers who can't separate the real
wheat from the phony chaff.
These presidents actually believe their own "secret agendas" have a chance
of success. They refuse to understand that what they want is just a minor
flea on the body of the true Plan:
global takeover by Globalist elites.
This isn't conspiracy, this is history going
back at least as far as 1913.
Why don't people want to see it? Because they've struggled to assert and
cement in a picture of reality by the time they've reached the age of
consent. And having done that, they can't face the idea that what they've
begged, borrowed, and stolen might be completely wrong.
During my life, I've met two significant politicians. Norman Thomas,
who for years ran for president on the Socialist ticket, came to our house
for dinner. He was a bore. Nothing I heard or saw reflected a vigorous mind
at work. As far as I could tell, he was just going over old clich√©s for the
thousandth time.
The other politician was Senator Hubert Humphrey. My parents dragged
me to a lecture of his when I was 16. I listened to the Hump talk for close
to three hours, and at the end of it, I was convinced he was the greatest
man in the world. At that time, he was at the height of his oratorical
powers. He was something to see.
A week later, I couldn't recall a single thing he'd said. It was then I
began to wonder what politics was all about.
Last night, I watched two sold-out specimens take their show on the
road in Denver. It was so, so tired. I waited for the water-skiing and the
hoops, but they never came.
Democrat-Republican politics in America is a walking dead man. We who know
this are trending, as they say. We need to expand our ranks. Two pernicious
book-end gargoyles aren't going to save the day.
