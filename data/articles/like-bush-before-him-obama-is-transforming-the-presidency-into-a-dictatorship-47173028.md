# Like Bush Before him Obama is Transforming the Presidency into A 
Dictatorship

Is there any doubt that
Barack Obama
is acting more and more like a dictator?
Obama is now using executive actions to
implement law which is illegal and entirely unconstitutional. The fact
that there is no political will to impeach him shows once again that
there is no difference between the Republicans or Democrats.
These two political parties are nothing more
than two factions of a corrupt political system. If there was true
opposition, impeachment proceedings would have begun long ago.
The Republicans wont even touch the issue
of impeachment despite countless scandals and criminal acts like,
-
the IRS targeting Tea Party groups
-
the Benghazi debacle
-
the Justice Department spying on
reporters
-
the ATF delivering guns to Mexican
drug cartels
-
unconstitutional NSA surveillance
activities
This just reveals how controlled they are.
It could easily be argued that just one of
the Obama scandals is many times worse than the Watergate fiasco which
forced Richard Nixon to resign from the Presidency back in the
1970s. What makes this so sick is that despite all of this insanity,
Obama is so filled with hubris that he now thinks he can make law with
his pen and phone through executive actions.
This was a major theme of his recent State
of the Union speech in which he openly announced his so-called year of
action.
Take for example the Affordable Care Act
otherwise known as Obamacare which he spent several years trying to cram
down everyones throat. Now that this disastrous law has been
implemented, Obama is unilaterally making politically
convenient changes to the same law that
he begged everyone to support.
There are also many
other unconstitutional executive actions that
Obama has taken such as,
...and others.
Whats scary is that this appears to be just
the beginning of him engaging in this activity. Clearly these actions
are not within the Presidents authority as only Congress has the
constitutional authority to make changes to law.
The Presidents role is to faithfully
execute the law as it is not make changes to it if there is something
they dont like.
Undoubtedly any Obama worshipping zombies
who read this will probably try to turn this into a fake Republican
versus Democrat debate and point out that
George W. Bush greatly expanded
executive authority through
the so-called war on terror.
It is true that Bush expanded the executive
branchs power during his two terms in office and he should have also
been impeached for doing so.
He even signed a
Presidential directive giving the
executive branch authority over all three branches of government during
a catastrophic emergency which was particularly outrageous.
What it boils down to is that there isnt
any significant difference between the actions that Bush and Obama have
taken. Their actions combined have slowly transformed the Presidency
into a dictatorial position.
When Obama was running for President back in
2008
he openly criticized Bush for expanding
executive power and bypassing Congress.
Does it get anymore hypocritical when we see
that Obama has done the same thing while in office? Besides his recent
executive actions, this is a guy who unilaterally decided to bomb Libya
without Congressional approval.
He even came close to launching military
strikes against Syria until finally deciding at the last minute that it
would be best to consult Congress before opening himself up to potential
war crimes.
If he really felt strongly about the dangers
of executive power he would not have hesitated to consult with Congress
in both instances.
Simply put, Obama is nothing more than a
hypocritical teleprompter reading buffoon who speaks out both sides of
his mouth. Unfortunately he has gotten a pass from so many people just
because he has black skin.
This begs another question,
One would think that this type of reporting
would be considered racist against white people since nobody ever
mentions the fact that hes half white.
Isnt Obama equally proud of his white
heritage as he is his black heritage? Of course these clowns will only
talk about race when they can point out or invent racism and bigotry
thats allegedly being directed against blacks or queers.
Since it is possible that Obama is actually
a closet homosexual it is no wonder why they go out of their way to
protect him.
Rumors of Obama doing cocaine and engaging
in homosexual activity have been reported for years. Not only that
but
he throws a baseball like an un-athletic little
girl and
he sucks at basketball.
The stories of him being a high school
basketball player are probably invented just like the rest of his
fraudulent manufactured persona. When Newsweek put out a cover with
Obama on it featuring the headline "First
Gay President", it is possible that they meant it literally as an
inside joke.
To conclude, there is little doubt that
Obama is turning the Presidency into more of a dictatorship as each day
goes by. Hes now openly changing and implementing laws through
executive actions which is blatantly illegal.
As a supposed constitutional lawyer he
should know full well that he is breaking the law and this makes him
doubly as guilty. He was recently caught on camera
saying that since hes President he can do
whatever he wants.
America better watch out because it looks
like he really means it and who knows what madness hes prepared to
unleash.
