The president and transnational
corporations
will make an aggressive push to pass
Fast Track this month,
but it is our job to stop them and make
it impossible
to bring Fast Track or the TPP up
again.
The White House is calling January "TPA (Trade
Promotion Authority) Month" and has made it their task to pass
Fast
Track.
President
Obama needs Fast Track to pass the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP). When Congress returned this month, a bill was quickly
introduced after delays of more than a year.
The lies begin with title of the bill: "The
Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014."
Bi-partisan? In
the House there was only one sponsor, Republican David Camp (MI). The
Republicans demanded the Democrats add a sponsor before it was introduced,
but due to public pressure, they could not find one.
The only Democrat on the bill in the Senate is
Max Baucus (MT) - the senator who gave us the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy
and who is leaving the senate to become Ambassador to China.
So, the bill
is only bi-partisan until he heads off to his new job.
Baucus likes to informally call the bill "The
Job Creating Bipartisan Trade Priorities Act," but that just adds another
lie since trade agreements consistently lose jobs, expand the wealth divide
and increase trade deficits.
TPP
Loses Momentum
After four years of secret negotiations with
more than 600 corporate advisers, the once seemingly invincible largest
trade bill in history, covering 40% of the world's economy , looks very much
like it can be defeated.
Why is the TPP looking like it can be stopped?
One reason is its secrecy.
Leaks are sinking the TPP like the Titanic on
its way to the bottom of the ocean. Ron Kirk, the
former US Trade Rep said they were keeping it secret because
the more people knew, the less they would like the TPP and it would become
so unpopular it could never become law.
Each leak has proven him right.
This week, Wikileaks published the
Environmental Chapter. The bottom line - there is no enforcement to
protect the environment. The TPP is worse than President
George W. Bush's
trade deals.
Mainstream environmental groups are saying the TPP is
unacceptable.
Similarly, the leak of
the Intellectual
Property Chapter revealed that it created a path to patent everything
imaginable, including plants and animals, to turn everything into a
commodity for profit.
The Obama administration was pushing it way beyond
normal intellectual property law in order to increase profits for everything
from pharmaceuticals to text books.
The refrain is always the same: profits come
first. The necessities of the people and protection of the planet come
last.
Backlash in Congress to
Fast Track
Baucus announced last March that he would
deliver Fast Track by June.
Pressure delayed it so that now the bill is
being introduced in the beginning of an election year. Election years are a
terrible time to pass anything controversial.
The TPP is becoming politically toxic. Over the
last year there has been a steady stream of emails and phone calls to
Congress. Members have faced constituent meetings and protests where TPP is
being raised.
Some examples of protests:
...we could go on.
Americans have sent a clear message to members
of Congress that they better not be associated with the TPP in an election
year. When Fast Track was introduced there was a
backlash, according to public
reports, of angry Democrats.
Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) told
Huffington Post:
"I'm a little disappointed that something's
dropped that was never discussed with Democrats in the House. As I
understand it, it wasn't actually discussed with Democrats in the
Senate."
Five members of the Senate Finance Committee told
US Trade Representative Mike Froman they will not support the Baucus Fast
Track bill because Congress needs to be involved throughout the process not
just in an up or down vote after it is completed.
During a hearing on Fast Track on Thursday protesters
were there expressing their displeasure.
Baucus says he will not be holding a mark-up of
the bill because of the divisions on the Finance Committee. Sen Ron Wyden
(D-OR) who will be taking Baucus' place told
Politico there was "broad frustration" with the lack of transparency.
Majority Leader Reid has put fast track on a slow track in the senate
saying he does not plan to bring it to the Senate Floor, saying there was
too much controversy around it.
As bad as the Senate sounds for the
administration, the House is even worse. Opposition has been building in
recent months with Democrats
and Republicans writing President Obama opposing Fast Track.
They could not find a Democratic co-sponsor and
now Politico
reports that Speaker Boehner says he will not bring the bill to the
floor for a vote unless 50 Democrats support it.
State of the Union -
Last Stand for Fast Track of TPP?
The president's TPA month is off to a bad start,
so he has to make a big pitch in his upcoming State of the Union on January
28.
If he doesn't, it is a sign he has given up and
is distancing himself from defeat. He's not only going to have to persuade
almost every Republican to support him (that would be a first for his
presidency), he's going to have to convince every Democrat who has not taken
a position, and change the minds of many who have already publicly said they
oppose Fast Track.
The problem is Members of Congress know that if
they get on the wrong side of corporate trade agreements, it will hurt them
politically.
The public is angry about this job-killing trade
deal, even Minority Leader Pelosi has had her
events interrupted by TPP protesters. In fact, an event
in Los Angeles with President Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid had
hundreds of TPP protesters.
The social movement against corporate trade is coming
across loud and clear leading top House
Dems to describe it as "dead on arrival" if it does not protect labor
and the environment.
We know from the Environment Chapter, it does not
protect the environment. Major unions oppose the TPP because it is evident,
like all corporate trade, it will be a bad deal for labor since a major goal
is lower wages.
The views of many in Congress were summarized in
a statement
by Democratic Reps.
George Miller (CA), Louise Slaughter (NY) and
Rosa
DeLauro (CT):
"Our constituents did not send us to
Washington to ship their jobs overseas, and Congress will not be a
rubber stamp for another flawed trade deal that will hang the middle
class out to dry."
Members of Congress have seen the research that
shows 90%
of Americans will see their income go down from the TPP while
the
wealthiest get wealthier.
Why would any Member of Congress want to sign on
to something like that - especially in an election year?
Congress should oppose Fast Track because it is
an Obama power grab. Under the
Baucus-Camp bill the Congress will have 90 days to review the
agreement. The House will have 60 days and the Senate will have an
additional 30 days.
The count begins when the White House decides the
negotiations have been completed.
Under the Baucus-Camp Fast Track the president
is also able to draft extensive implementing legislation to bring US law
into compliance with the agreement. It is up to the president to decide what
changes in laws or new laws are needed to comply with the TPP.
Congress is
not able to mark-up or amend the language of these bills. And, these can be
very significant laws.
For example, provisions like "Buy American" or "Buy
Local" can be repealed as a restraint on trade. In all of these cases under
Fast Track the president becomes the Congress and drafts legislation,
totally destroying the checks and balances of the three branches of
government.
As some anti-TPP activists in Los Angeles showed
in a great street
theater action in front of the offices of Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-CA),
Fast Track makes Congress unnecessary.
They brought the "TPP movers" to his
office and outsourced him. It is important for activists to know what is in
Fast Track because the US Trade Representative has been doing its best
to mislead the public.
Time to Finish the Job, Make Fast Track
for the TPP Politically Toxic
The movement against the TPP has come a long way
in the last year from challenging a trade agreement that no one knew about
and looked like it could not be stopped; to a trade agreement widely known
about in activist circles and which is becoming too toxic for elected
officials to be associated with in an election year.
The reason we have come this far is because the
TPP affects so many aspects of every person's lives - food, the environment,
workplaces, the Internet, banking and finance, job availability, health
care, energy, the list goes on and on.
As people learn about the TPP and
what it does they oppose it. While lame ducks like Obama and Baucus who do
not have to seek re-election can ignore angry constituents and follow the
demands of big money, those seeking re-election do not have that luxury.
Our task: We need to continue to build
opposition and show elected officials they do not want to be associated with
these toxic trade agreements. They need to understand that fast-tracking the
TPP could end their career.
A lot is already planned.
To stay informed "like"
the Flush The TPP Facebook page and follow the twitter
feed where we will be regularly publishing new sharable memes to
continue to build the stop the TPP movement.
If more TPP leaks come out,
we'll provide immediate analysis. If there are hearings we will organize
protests to make sure the voices of opposition are heard and share that
information.
Every Tuesday there is a TPP twitter storm at 9
PM Eastern. Follow the hashtag #TPPMediaMarch to participate. There will be
a special TPP storm during the State of the Union on January 28.
Scores of organizations have come together in a
movement of movements to create a webpage StopFastTrack.org. We've planned ten key days of pressure on Congress from January 22 to
January 31.
During this period, people will be making phone calls to
Congress through
the website which will provide simple tools to call Congress. In
addition, during this period, people are organizing for the State of the
Union on January 28 and an Inter-Continental Day of Action on January 31.
During the State of the Union, people opposed to
the TPP plan to stand vigil outside of the Congress beginning at 8:30 PM so
they can be there when the president arrives for the speech that begins at 9
PM.
During the speech a special State Of The Union TwitterStorm will be
held from 9-10pm EST, follow #TPPMediaMarch to participate.
On January 31 there will be an Inter-Continental
Day of Action against the TPP & Corporate Globalization.
The theme is
'No More NAFTAs' as this month is the twenty-year anniversary of NAFTA,
which has had devastating
consequences for working families, small farmers, indigenous peoples,
small business and the environment in all three countries and beyond.
The TPP is fairly described as "NAFTA on
Steroids."
We have come an incredible distance and the
likelihood of stopping the TPP is stronger than it ever has been.
The
president and transnational corporations will make an aggressive push to
pass Fast Track this month. It is our job to stop them and make it
impossible to bring Fast Track or the TPP up again.
We can accomplish this
and when we do it will be a tremendous victory of the people over
transnational corporate power!
