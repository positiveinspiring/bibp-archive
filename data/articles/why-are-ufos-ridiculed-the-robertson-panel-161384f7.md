At a certain level of government, it seems that Reports of UFOs rather
than
the UFOs themselves were regarded as a
threat to national security.
After World War II operators who literally
plugged you in when making a phone call handled telephone calls. The
government became concerned that our phone system was being overrun by UFO
reports.
On September 24, 1952, H. Marshall
Chadwell, wrote a memo to CIA Director Walter Smith stating,
Im concerned that large numbers of phone
calls, a huge volume of letters and press releases, ATIC (Air Technical
Intelligence Center) had received 1500 official UFO reports since 1947,
and 250 reports in July alone.
That the public concern with the phenomena, which is reflected in both
in the US press and the pressure of inquiry upon the Air Force indicates
that a fair proportion of our population is mentally conditioned to the
acceptance of the incredible. In this fact lies the potential for
creating mass hysteria and panic.
The U.S.S.R. is credited with the present capability of delivering an
air attack against the United States, yet at any given moment now, there
may be current a dozen official unidentified sightings plus many
unofficial ones.
At any moment of attack, we are now in a position where we cannot, on an
instant basis distinguish hardware from phantom, and as the tension
mounts, we will run the increasing risk of false alerts and the even
greater danger of falsely identifying the real as phantom.
What could be done to stop people from
reporting UFOs?
The
Robertson Panel was convened by
the CIA
to discuss the problem during January 14 to 17, 1953.
The panel concluded UFOs were not a threat,
but that the continued emphasis on the reporting of these phenomena does, in
these perilous times, result in a threat to the orderly functioning of the
protective organs of the body politic.
This threat involved the clogging of
communication channels with UFO reports, the cultivation of a morbid
national psychology in which skillful hostile propaganda could induce
hysterical behavior and harmful distrust of duly constituted authority.
Consequently, the Panel recommended that,
the national security agencies take
immediate steps to strip the UFOs of the special status they have been
given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately have acquired."
The method prescribed was debunking UFOs.
Here is the Panels debunking strategy from some
the top scientific minds in the government such as,
-
Nobel Prize winner in Physics Dr. Luis
Alverez
-
Dr. Lloyd Berkner director of the
Brookhaven National Laboratories and Chairman
-
Dr. H.P. Robertson director of Weapons
Systems Evaluation at the Secretary of Defense
The debunking aim would result in reduction in
public interest in flying saucers which today evokes a strong
psychological reaction.
This education could be accomplished by mass
media such as television, motion pictures and popular articles. Basis of
such education would be actual case histories, which had been puzzling at
first but later explained.
As in the case of conjuring tricks, there is
much less stimulation if the secret is known. Such a program should tend
to reduce the current gullibility of the public and consequently their
susceptibility to clever hostile propaganda.

Study of Unidentified Flying Objects.
Editors Note
Essentially belittling and propaganda
techniques were used to debunk the reality of UFOs in order to help protect
the United States and other countries from propaganda that could induce
hysterical behavior and clog communications channels.
Robertson Panel was still putting a
negative spin on UFO news at least 13 years after the panel met.
