Police in the US now rival criminals, and exceed
terrorists, as the greatest threat to the American public.
Rogelio Serrato
is the latest case to be in the news of an innocent person murdered by the
police. Serrato was the wrong man, but the Monterey County, California, SWAT
team killed the 31-year old father of four and left the family home a
charred ruin.
The fact that SWAT teams often go to the wrong door shows the carelessness
with which excessive force is used.
In one instance the police even confused
the towns mayor with a drug dealer, broke into his home, shot dead the
familys pet dogs, and held
the mayor and his wife and children at gun point. But most cases of police
brutality
never make the news.
Most who suffer abuse from the police dont bother to complain. They know
that to make an enemy of the police brings a lifetime of troubles. Those who
do file complaints find that police departments tend to be self-protective
and that the naive and gullible public tends to side with the police.
However, you can find plenty of examples of police brutality on YouTube,
more than you can watch in a lifetime.
I have just searched Google for
youtube police brutality and the result is:
more than 500,000 results.
Theres
everything from police shooting a guy in a wheelchair to body slamming a
befuddled 89-year old great grandmother to tasering kids and mothers with
small children.
The fat goon cops love to beat up on women, kids, and old
people.
The 497,000 Google results may contain duplicates as more than one person
might have posted a video of the same event, and the incidents occurred over
more than one year. However, probably only a small percentage of incidents
are captured on video by onlookers, and many incidents of police brutality
have no witnesses.
What the videos reveal is that a large percentage of
police move with alacrity to assault the public. The number of incidences
could be very high. One million annually would not be an exaggeration.
In contrast, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, in 2009 (the most
recent year for which data is compiled), there were 806,000 aggravated
assaults (not including assaults by police against the public) by criminals
against the public, of which 216,814 were committed by hands and feet and
not by weapons. (In the U.S. if you merely push a person or grab his arm,
you have committed assault.
Freedom and democracy America uses any excuse
to multiply the number of felons.)
Considering the data, one might conclude that the police are a greater
danger to the public than are criminals.
Indeed, the trauma from police assault can be worse than from assault by
criminals. The public thinks the police are there to protect them. Thus, the
emotional and psychological shock from assault by police is greater than the
trauma from being mugged because you stupidly wandered into the wrong part
of town.
Why are the police so aggressive toward the public?
In part because their ranks attract bullies, sociopaths and psychopaths.
Even normal cops are proud of their authority and expect deference. Even
cops who are not primed to be set off can turn nasty in a heartbeat.
In part because police are not accountable. The effort decades ago to have
civilian police review boards was beat back by law and order
conservatives.
In part because the police have been militarized by the federal government,
equipped with military weapons, and trained to view the public as the enemy.
In part because the Bush/Cheney/Obama regimes have made every American a
suspect. The only civil liberty that has any force in the U.S. today is the
law against racial discrimination. This law requires that every American
citizen be treated as if he were a Muslim terrorist.
The Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) rigorously enforces the refusal to discriminate
between terrorist and citizen at airports and is now taking its Gestapo
violations of privacy into every form of travel and congregation:
trucking,
bus and train travel, sports events, and, without doubt, shopping centers
and automobile traffic.

This despite the fact that there have been no terrorist incidents that could
be used to justify such an expansive intrusion into privacy and freedom of
movement.
The TSA has not caught a single terrorist.
However, it has abused and
inconvenienced several hundred thousand innocent American citizens.
The abuse happens, because people with authority are dying to use the
authority.
The absence of terrorists means that the TSA turns innocent
Americans into terrorists.
There have been so many absurd cases.
-
One woman
traveling with her ill and dying mother, who required special food, had
contacted the TSA prior to the flight, explained the situation, and was
given permission to take the special food onboard. But when she went through
security, the food was taken away, and when she protested she was arrested
and hauled off, leaving the elderly mother in a wheelchair deserted.
-
Others have been arrested because a member of the household used a suitcase
or carry bag to take guns and ammunition to the gun club or on a hunting
trip and forgot to remove all the ammo, or the explosives test detected
gunpowder residuals.
-
Boy Scouts forgot to remove pocket knives from
backpacks that they took on camping trips.
-
Lactating mothers forced to give
up breast milk. And so on...
These are the great dangers that the TSA protect the
American sheeple
from, and the sheeple submit, even servile thanking their oppressors for
'protecting' them.
Submission is what the government and the police want. Anyone who argues
with TSA or the police will be abused. An American who stands up for his
rights is likely to be beaten to a pulp. TSA has announced that such
Americans are suspects and will be held in indefinite detention.
And our government assures us that we have freedom and democracy. We
have a police state, and everyone who forgets it is in deep trouble.
The Amerikan police state is closely allied with police states all over the
world - Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Israel in the Middle East and
former constituent parts of the Soviet Empire in Central Asia.
The U.S.
government never lifts a finger in behalf of democracy anywhere.
In fact,
the U.S. government quickly moves to overthrow democracy wherever it rears
its head, as the U.S. recently did in Honduras. Before Honduras it was
Palestine where the U.S. overturned the election that brought Hamas to
power. Now Washington is targeting Lebanon where Hezbollah has gained.
Everywhere on earth the U.S. government prefers an autocracy that it can
purchase to free elections that bring to power candidates unwilling to serve
as American puppets.
The U.S. government is the most determined foe of democracy in the world.
Yet, Washington lectures China, which has more civil liberties than
Bush/Cheney/Obama permit Americans.
If Americans ever find the emotional strength to acknowledge the oppression
under which they live, they, too, will be in the streets.
