On Wednesday, November 24th, the National Inflation Association
released a shocking and stunning video entitled, 'The Day the Dollar Died',
which shows the world exactly what could happen to the U.S. economy in the
very near future during the first 12 hours of a U.S. dollar collapse.
Although the video itself is fictional, NIA
believes a U.S. dollar collapse is inevitable and there is a strong
likelihood that the U.S. will experience an outbreak of hyperinflation this
decade.
'The Day the Dollar Died' is a wake up call for
Americans who aren't yet stocking up on gold, silver and food supplies. The
U.S. dollar's day of reckoning is coming and only Americans who prepare now
will survive.
In just 42 hours since its release, 'The Day the Dollar Died' has already
been viewed over 145,000 times on YouTube.
It is currently YouTube's #1 top favorited news
and politics video. Approximately 1,200 people have commented about the
video on YouTube alone, with thousands of more comments having been made
about the video on hundreds of Internet blogs that have featured it. An
amazing 93.5% of those who have watched 'The Day the Dollar Died' have given
it a thumbs up.
All of the discussion about 'The Day the Dollar Died' comes hot on the heels
of NIA's October 31st release of its latest critically acclaimed
full length documentary 'End of Liberty', which shows how Americans are
rapidly losing their liberties and freedoms, and how our country is headed
for a complete societal collapse.
'End
of Liberty' has already received about 1/2 million views in less
than one month.
On November 5th, NIA released a report with its projections for future U.S.
food prices based on the recently announced $600 billion in quantitative
easing by the Federal Reserve.
Several days later, NIA's food inflation report
was featured live on Fox News by Glenn Beck, who was recently ranked by
Newsweek as the #2 most influential political figure in the country. On
November 12th, NIA's President Gerard Adams was a guest on the
Fox Business Network, where he spoke about the potential for food inflation
to take over as America's biggest crisis in 2011.
NIA is not a political organization and does not support Republicans or
Democrats.
NIA exists solely for the purpose of educating
Americans to the truth about the U.S. economy and inflation. Americans live
in a country where 99% of those who studied economics in college were taught
voodoo Keynesian economics.
Keynesian economists have the mistaken belief that all recessions are bad
and must be suppressed by government interference in the free market. They
believe that by
the Federal Reserve manipulating interest rates to
artificially low levels and printing trillions of dollars of fiat money out
of thin air, they can create jobs, economic growth, and wealth.
They believe
that a little bit of inflation is good for an economy.
Keynesian economists fail to realize that when price inflation breaks out,
it becomes impossible to contain unless interest rates are immediately
raised to a level that is higher than the real rate of price inflation.
Unfortunately, due to the current size and scope of our national debt and
unfunded liabilities, NIA believes it will be impossible for the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates higher than the real rate of inflation.
Real interest rates are likely to stay negative
until the U.S. dollar collapses and is officially declared dead and
worthless.
-
Gas and grocery bills for all Americans have been rising substantially in
recent months.
-
The average American has been seeing health insurance costs
spiral out of control on an annual basis.
-
Students have been suffering from
college tuitions rising like there is no tomorrow.
-
Massive price inflation
is all around us, yet
the mainstream media continues to ignore the truth and
reports the government's phony CPI numbers as gospel.
Politicians in Washington from both sides of the aisle have been colluding
with the media in order to brainwash Americans into believing inflation is
not a problem and that their real fear should be deflation.
Deflation is a
good thing for middle class Americans because it means their money is worth
more and their incomes and savings have more purchasing power.
Inflation is only good for the politicians
because it allows them to steal the wealth of middle class Americans and
redistribute it to their banker friends on Wall Street who don't produce
anything of real value.
There is no reason for a lawyer or banker to make more money than a farmer
or factory worker. This is only made possible by the system we have today,
where Americans get suckered into electing representatives who promise
entitlements that the government can't afford without printing the money to
pay for them.
When the dollar bubble bursts and the system
collapses, the free market will allow farmers and goods producers to become
wealthy while lawyers and bankers go broke.
Most Americans are naive enough to believe that because the U.S. has
survived for so long with such a huge national debt and continuous budget
deficits, the country will be able to continue down this path forever
without any consequences because after all, this is America we are talking
about.
The truth is,
-
our national debt has grown by 70.7% over the past five
years
-
compared to 41.8% during the previous five years
-
and 14.3% during
the five years before that...
Meanwhile, our GDP has grown by 17.9% over the
past five years, compared to 27.5% during the previous five years, and 32.9%
during the five years before that.
We have gone from our GDP growing more than
twice as fast as our debt, to our debt growing at nearly quadruple the speed
of our GDP. A train wreck is getting ready to happen and this train wreck is
literally unstoppable.
