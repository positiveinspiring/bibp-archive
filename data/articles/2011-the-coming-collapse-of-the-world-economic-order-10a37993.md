CHAPTER 24
Pitfalls and Fallacies of the Orion Monetary System
by Dr. Georgi Stankov
2011
It is a done deal that
the current financial system will collapse this
year [2011] within a very short period of time. In fact, the system has
already collapsed more than two years ago when the Wall Street
investment banking was practically wiped out from the map within a week
in October 2008.
This happened shortly after the first huge wave of Christ consciousness
was released on earth and allowed for more transparency and sincerity in
human relations. This information is given as evidence for the basic
statement in this essay: All dramatic and sweeping changes, we
experience on earth, are associated with and triggered by significant
changes in the energetic structure of human beings.
They weaken the shackles of all incarnated
entities that have been imposed on them in a perfidious manner by the
Powers That Be and open them for the transcendental truth of
All-That-Is...
The release of Christ consciousness on earth is associated with the
so-called Ra-Ta-experiment that is explained by the channel Cosmic
Awareness in his numerous messages. The author recommends the reader to
check this information in order to better understand the current
situation on earth. It is one of the clearest channels this author has
ever come upon.
Unfortunately, the energizers and the group around this channel are
intellectually not quite prepared for the information that has been
given to them. This fact explains the redundancy in the messages and the
somewhat narrow spectrum of topics discussed by this channel. For
instance, the actual financial situation is not at all elaborated by
this channel from a theoretical point of view, although it has made some
good economic forecasts in the past.
Nonetheless, this source is the most reliable and extensive source in
Internet (over 8000 pages of channeled messages since 1975). In
comparison to it, most channeled esoteric information available in
Internet can only be digested, if one is prepared to commit an
intellectual hara-kiri before reading it.
The author mentions the Ra-Ta-experiment at the beginning of his
discussion, because it gives the reader a clue as to when the financial
system is expected to collapse this year. In anticipation of this event,
a theoretical analysis of the factors that will lead to this crash may
appear to be of secondary importance. It is quite probable that the
financial crash will happen before this essay will be published.
The second wave of Christ consciousness was released in late autumn
2009, shortly before the final period of
earth Ascension - 2010 to 2012
(last triad) - has begun. In this context the last year was a
preparation for what will be manifested this year.
The final third wave of Christ consciousness has commenced this year
and will reach its peak around spring equinox. The current revolution in
Egypt is the first eruptive manifestation of this wave, which is closely
associated with the history of this ancient country, although Christ
energies flood the whole planet.
It is expected that the Egyptian revolution
will spread out to many other Arab countries and destroy the fragile
balance of the current World Order as designed by the dark forces. One
very probable consequence will be the disruption of oil supply to the
West from the Middle East.
This event may trigger the financial crisis that has many fathers, but
one mother - the world inflation, the unprecedented bubble in money
supply that has undermined the foundations of the world economy. This
inflation has been deliberately instigated by the dark forces and their
proxies in the financial corporations by creating money out of debt and
thin air in order to impoverish humanity and establish the New World
Order.
This has been the pronounced aim of the
Powers That Be in the last several decades. This effort has exacerbated
during the first decade of the third millennium.
Before the author begins with the analysis of the nefarious methods
that the dark forces have employed in the past to destroy the financial
system and the economy of mankind in order to enslave it, he would like
to point out that their plan to establish the New World Order has
already failed.
However, this does not mean that the financial system will not
collapse. It will collapse to a much greater extent than the dark forces
and their financial proxies, the banksters on Wall Street and in
London city, have planned for. Instead of achieving the intended
impoverishment of the masses, first and foremost, of the middle class,
the financial Elite will be buried under the rubble of the upcoming
financial tsunami.
Precisely, they will lose very soon all
their monies and power, and all their institutions, such as,
-
banks
-
funds
-
securitizations
-
stock exchanges
-
central banks, etc.
...will be
abolished forever.
In this way they will lose their financial leverage
of manipulating humanity prior to Ascension.
As the national states have also been designed by the hidden
governments to promote the New World Order on the long run, they will
also financially collapse this year [2011]. In other words, there will
be no more criminal bailouts to save the dark ones at the expense of the
taxpayers as means of enslaving the latter.
The abolishment of the national states as
operative units - the nations will remain - will be associated with the
collapse of the health care system, rental system, and all other forms
of human securities that have been promoted by the Powers That Be as
part of the Orion monetary system with the objective to hold the people
firm in their grip.
These institutions have been deliberately implemented to stimulate the
survival (self-preservatory) fears of the masses about their future, as
the current political discussion in the USA on the new health care
reform of Obama clearly demonstrates.
All these wrong concepts and structures stem
originally from the primary idea of separation from the Whole and from
hiding the fact that humans are unlimited powerful creators of their
destiny, who are also responsible for the astral regulation of their
bodies, so that no bank accounts or obsolete medical treatments can
protect them from calamities, if the soul has a different plan from that
of the incarnated entity.
Let us discuss in this context the concept of securitization in the
financial system from a psychological point of view, as it is the
central piece of fraud that creates the conditions of destructive
interference in the economy and will cause its collapse this year.
The idea to secure ones life by creating bank accounts and saving money
is so perverted and at the same time so deeply rooted in current
pecuniary human thinking that one has to put the whole humanity on
Freudian couch and analyze it for the next 2000 years, before it can be
declared convalescent. Unfortunately Cosmic Providence has not foreseen
that much time for those who will make up their mind to ascend.
For those who will go along the path of
further separation on
planet B, the time of healing their mental
aberrations will be unlimited.
What is the psycho-mental dynamics behind the concept of securitization
of all aspects of human life? The primary faulty idea is that people are
vulnerable biological beings that may suffer from diseases, injuries,
financial, social, and numerous other imponderable events that are
beyond human control, because these follow the random laws of chaos and
incalculable probabilities.
This world view is a central piece of the camouflage, of the cover-up,
that humans are responsible creators of their destiny and that not a
single event can ever occur on earth, unless it has been considered by
the entity in advance in infinite astral probability alternatives in the
dream state. We create at night and experience at daytime.
Without dreaming, there will be no living.
Alternatively we can say that we live our dreams. From another
perspective, we may as well sustain that our dreams are the only true
reality and that our life in the 3d-reality on earth is an illusion of
our true dreams. It all comes up to the same thing.
All events, one encounters on earth, are mirror images of the
particular feelings and beliefs of the individual entity that serve as
pedagogical means to make him aware of the fact that he is an inexorable
creator of reality as being part of All-That-Is.
The outer experience is of a secondary
importance - the events one experiences are decors for the emotional and
mental multidimensionality of the entity. Such experiences are empty
signs and symbols for deeper realities that show him the way on his
individual roadmap to Ascension and merging with the Whole.
Therefore, if one has negative experiences, for instance, a series of
car crashes, misfortunes in business and in personal relations that are
always associated with financial losses, what sense does it make to
securitize such risks by paying even more money to anonymous fraudulent
corporations to protect him from such undesirable events?
In this case, one only perpetuates the
psycho-mental causes of his misfortune on the next existential level.
The perverted mind-set of being a helpless victim of imponderable
circumstances is further aggravated.
This pattern of human behavior stems from the wrong conviction that one
has to solve his problems in the outer world by surrounding himself with
huge hedges against all possible evils that lurk from the mist of
unpredictable reality. Such behavior leads to curtailing the inherent,
unrestricted creativity of human beings by dumping down the inner
impulses of the soul that guides the incarnated entity to make the
appropriate experiences in the 3d-reality.
Ultimately, the entity gives up his freedom of choice given to him by
his soul and succumbs to his fears.
He no longer explores life with an open
mind, but opens the door for even greater emotional manipulations by
various dark forces from the 4th dimension that hamper him in his
spiritual evolution. This mind-set is underlying current society - from
anti-terror wars and other atrocities of the Western nations against the
rest of the world to rigid surveillance of their own people on airports
and other areas of social life.
The
Big Brother is watching you. Orwells
vision of
1984 does not belong to the past, but is already a reality and
a foreboding of a grimmer future.
Let us be plain on this issue:
One cannot do anything to secure his
life, then life is created by the soul, and she is the ultimate
authority on how it ought to be spent by the incarnated entity, and when
it ought to be terminated.
The agnostic ego of the incarnated entity
lives in the greatest of all illusions that it has control over life.
It is driven by his fears to do something, anything, all the time in
order to preserve his life - to earn money in order to eat and survive,
to represent somebody in the society (the more you earn, the more you
represent), to pay with precious money as to hedge an unpredictable
future (the higher the amount of securitization, the more secure the
entity feels), etc.
Like the famous ant in the poem why should
she be calm and placid, when she is full of formic acid, the formic
acid being the fears of the entity, humans engage themselves all the
time in worthless activities, instead of being powerful
multi-dimensional, creative beings (tautology = principle of last
equivalence): Being a soul. The soul, the higher self, is being - the
fear-driven entity is doing.
A key point in the hidden agenda of the dark forces to enslave mankind
is to use the current financial system to deepen the psychological
conviction of incarnated human entities that they are separated from the
Whole and thus an easy prey to unpredictable chaotic events. Money is
considered to be the only save haven in the 3d-reality and in this
context the only goal of human existence. Money symbolizes not only
prosperity, easy life, and popularity, but, first and foremost, safe
life amidst death and organic decay.
As most entities do not believe in the immortality of the human
personality and the soul, they must believe that have only one life to
live, and that this life is hence very precious. Extrapolate these
faulty beliefs on the mentality of the current Elite as human
representatives of the dark forces and consider the fact that most of
them are the current controllers of the financial system you will have a
vivisection of all human evils on earth nowadays.
The financial Elite, be they
Rothschilds,
Rockefellers,
FED, American and Anglo-Saxon banks, and their CEO, some of
which are clones of the dark forces (the
Greys and
the Reptilians), are, from a higher
vantage point of view, not only the perpetrators - they are in the first
place victims of their hypertrophied fears. They are deeply perverted
entities, entrapped in their earthly Purgatory.
In order to contain their fears with respect to their imagined
mortality and biological vulnerability, they see the purpose of their
life solely in laying financial shackles upon all human beings, whom
they deeply despise. While worshiping the Mammon they serve, they strive
to make all humans slaves of the Orion monetary system.
The more the masses are impoverished and
under their control, the better and secure the Elite feel.
However, there will be no absolute security for the Elite as long as
they do not believe in life after death or in Ascension. Only the idea
of the immortality of the soul and the incarnated personality as part of
All-That-Is can render the feeling of security, even amidst mayhem and
destruction, as the coming months will eventually reveal.
Had the Elite have acknowledged this truth, they would not have been
found in the financial sector, but among light workers. Fears have the
propensity to create new fears, until they encompass the whole reality.
The fears of the Elite have intoxicated the whole planet. Therefore,
they are not satisfied with the total financial enslavement of humanity,
but they also aim at controlling the people physically through an
oppressive political system. This is the reason why they prepare society
for the New World Order during the last several centuries.
This human condition was almost achieved by the Bolsheviks after the
October Revolution in Russia. Similar conditions can now be observed,
for instance, in North Korea and in Myanmar. The situation in
Egypt
before the current revolution was not much different.
The means of enslavement in the Western world are far more subtle, but
not less heinous. When one perceives recent history of mankind from this
perspective, one will soon realize that every human effort to progress
spiritually and to achieve abundance for the people has been
successfully pervaded by the Powers That Be and their human minions -
the current Elite. This is the reason why true progress and
enlightenment have never gained broad success on this planet.
In the financial sector, these obstructive practices include the
abolishment of the gold standard, the establishment of the European
Union, the introduction of the Euro, the intention to establish a free
trade zone in North America, the usurpation of financial power by
central banks, such as the FED that are private or corporative
institutions but have control over the money system of sovereign
countries, etc.
The list of financial crimes of the Elite against the people is
infinite, but they are not really discerned by the masses, which are
lulled by fake social ideals. Some of these atrocities have been
highlighted by critical journalists and independent voices in the last
several years, which are marked by a gradual increase of transparency
and a quest for revelation of all hidden facts.
The moral and ethical indignation that sweeps the globe since the
beginning of this year is part of the emotional reaction of the people
who are beginning to awaken for the atrocities of the Powers That Be and
realizing for the first time in the history of mankind that they have
been pawns to them for thousands of years.
While emotions are the astral wings to
Ascension of the incarnated entity, they are not sufficient enough to
comprehend the mechanisms of human enslavement on this toxic planet.
Therefore, let us elaborate the
aforementioned facts from a neutral scientific point of view by
employing the cosmic laws of constructive and destructive interference,
before we delve into technical details.
It is a leitmotif of this essay that a separation from All-That-Is does
not exist. Even if an entity sustains the illusion of such a state for a
long period of time, it can only exist as a sentient being, if it is in
a state of perfect constructive interference at a higher level - that of
his soul.
Now let us elaborate this basic insight with another example. The
Powers that Be, the Unholy six, especially the Greys and the Reptilians,
have developed in the last decades, since they have started to cooperate
actively with the Elite and the hidden governments on earth, new human
clones through genetic engineering.
As already mentioned above, about one third
of the entities that now live on earth are such clones. However, they
can only exist, if they are humanized by souls from the 4th and 5th
dimensions. No genetic engineering can create humans or other sentient
beings, unless they contain energies and frequencies from the higher
realms of All-That-Is.
Their very existence is a proof that they do
so under the condition of constructive interference within the infinite
and absolute harmony of All-That-Is, even if they are not aware of it.
Most of these genetically created human beings are very young souls
that are just beginning with their incarnation cycle and cannot root
themselves firmly in the 3d-reality. The fraction of the soul (lower
self) that is incarnated in such genetically engineered human vessels
must be totally separated from All-That-Is as to guarantee the adequate
3d-conditions of physical density that such souls have chosen to
experience at this low level of evolution.
As already mentioned, many CEO of large corporations are such
clones of
human entities, whose souls have finished with their earthly experience
in this incarnation and have returned to the 5th dimension.
In order to preserve the charade on earth,
such entities do not necessarily die, but are exchanged by the Unholy
six and their human proxies with clones, which harbour much of the
memories and the personality of the previous entity.
The former president
George Bush is, for instance, such a clone. The
original Bush was eliminated about two years before the end of his
second term and was substituted with a clone, because he became somewhat
rebellious to the Powers That Be that pull the strings behind the
curtain in Washington.
They feared that he may become a potential
danger to their plans with his uncontrolled remarks, a liability they
did not want to share. They murdered him and exchanged him with a clone.
The new version of him was due to the genetic engineering much more
docile to the Powers That Be, to the hidden American government.
The entity
Bill Clinton has been substituted
by several clones already. This example is paradigmatic as to how
the
manipulation of humanity is arranged from the 4th dimension, although it
can only exist with the help of the souls from the 5th that have decided
to incarnate in such genetically created human bodies.
The author understands very well that some readers may find this
information abominable and recoil, but they should keep in mind that
modern mankind was created in the same manner by the Powers That Be some
13,000 years ago. Why not now? It is one thing to create a human
biological vessel through genetic engineering, quite a different thing
to help the incarnated entity evolve to a 5th-dimensional being.
In every incarnated entity on earth, there are two opposite forces that
influence his mental and emotional body simultaneously and are in an
incessant inner strife - the Forces of Light that forge his merging with
All-That-Is and the forces of dark that push him into a deeper
separation from the Whole.
Financial systems, societies, national states, armies, corporations,
technological achievements are nothing else, but empty decors that
prepare the scene for the eternal battle between the Luciferian forces,
the fallen angels, and the Forces of Light. This inner strife is waged
within each incarnated entity, so that the prodigal son can have his
experience of separation and returns wiser to God.
This is the ultimate eschatology of human
existence on earth and on any 3d-planet in the solar universes.
Finally, it should be noted that the Forces of Light also have the
right to eliminate evil human entities and substitute them with their
own clones, if they pose a great threat to humanity. This was done, for
instance, on a large scale in 1978-1979 when the hidden government of
the USA, instigated by the Unholy six, planned a first destructive
nuclear strike against the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.
Most of the entities on power, including the
then President Carter, were eliminated and
substituted with clones by
the Forces of Light.
The entity Carter was however murdered by the dark forces, because he
objected their criminal plans and was only then substituted with a clone
by the Forces of Light, so that he could carry out his mission as
enlightened president. The moral and ethical structure of this entity
was fully preserved in his clone.
The other minions of the dark forces were
eliminated by the Forces of Light and their helpers on earth as to
prevent a devastating catastrophe. The price for this crime committed
against a bunch of evil entities was the divine redemption of humanity
from total destruction. This episode was the darkest and most critical
in the recent history of mankind, notwithstanding the fact that this is
not known to the broad public.
Such interventions are part of the game that has been played for eons
of time on this toxic planet. Let us recall that the body is only an
instrument of collecting 3d-experience and has nothing to do with the
personality of the incarnated entity.
After Ascension, all human beings will have
the possibility to choose their own body and change it at their
discretion through imagination and direct manifestation. Contrary to the
Powers That Be from the 4th dimension, they will not need to involve in
primitive genetic engineering to create deficient clones that can only
survive a limited period of time.
Human beings will very soon begin to create
from the soul level of unconditional love.
After this indispensable clarification as to how the Powers That Be
actively manipulate mankind in general and the financial system in
particular as to trigger its collapse, we must return to the cosmic laws
of creation and destruction and explain why these manipulations fulfill
the condition of destructive interference and will not only lead to a
financial crash, but will also eliminate the influence of the dark
forces on mankind before Ascension.
When an entity or a society decides to go along the path of greater
separation from the Whole, it inevitably creates conditions of
destructive interference all the time, as it no longer recognizes the
laws of Creation as an inherent part of All-That-Is. Creation in
separation lacks responsibility.
True Creation within All-That-Is is always responsible, as it is
performed from the level of unconditional love, which is an esoteric
circumscription for the cosmic condition of constructive interference.
This truth will emerge as a key aspect after Ascension, when many
incarnated entities will acquire the possibility to create by
imagination, but will still have to learn how to do it in a responsible
manner within the divine harmony of All-That-Is.
All structures that are created in a state of separation from the
Source are intrinsically unstable and tend always to collapse at some
point in linear time. The ultimate decision when such inferior creations
ought to be destroyed is made in the higher realms or dimensions of
All-That-Is, which render the energies for the existence of such
structures and support the overall conditions of Creation.
One may call such higher realms God or Elohims,
without affecting anything on the laws of Creation as presented in this
essay.
Under these premises the current battle between the Forces of Light and
the dark forces is, strictly speaking, not a real battle, but a
camouflage thereof. Just as the ego may gain the illusion that it has
control over the life of the incarnated entity, as long as the soul let
it believe so, so do the Forces of Light let the 4d-entities from
the
Orion Empire believe that they have control over earth and humanity for
some time.
Ultimately, the outcome of this symbolic
battle is predetermined, as the decision for earth and mankind to ascend
has been fallen at the highest levels of Cosmic Providence since eons of
time.
The ego of the incarnated entity was initially created as an external
reference point of view to that of the Creator-Soul. It ought to be a
unique mirror image of the soul, but it was never intended that the ego
should take full control over the incarnated entity from the soul. It
may only seem to be so. Especially in agnostic societies, such as
current human society, this hallucinatory impression may cherish quite
well for some time, as this has been the case in the last several
centuries since the begin of industrialization of mankind.
During the so called Dark Ages (in German Mittelalter,
Middle
Ages), the connection of the incarnated entities with the soul was much
more pronounced, probably due to the poor living conditions, where hope
for immortality and eternal bliss was the only beacon of light in those
dire human conditions.
Much of the poetry at that time reflects
this endeavor of humans to unite with God in the transcendental
dimension.
Human ego is agnostic. And it has never been more agnostic than at this
time. Like a kaleidoscope, the collective ego of our soulless mechanical
time creates incessantly numerous illusionary images of its alleged
autarky. These external images render the ego the false security and the
erroneous conviction that it is the master of this human charade that it
creates under extreme energetic limitations.
Especially in the industrialized world, where the number of material
devices, such as phones, iPods, and all other childs games that
distract the incarnated entity from exploring the multidimensional
nature of his soul has grown exponentially in the last few years, the
separation from All-That-Is has reached an unprecedented peak. Under
such conditions, it is no longer possible to have a further spiritual
evolution.
The conditions must, therefore, radically
change, and the speckles removed from the blind eyes of humanity.
Ascension is the surrender of the ego to the soul. The ego must give up
its illusion to be in full control of its destiny and merge with the
higher self. This is the most poignant experience on earth and the most
liberating at the same time. This greatest illusion of all times will be
abruptly terminated this year.
Likewise, the illusion of the Powers That Be, the Unholy Six from the
4th dimension, that they control earth must end this year [2011]. This
will not happen exclusively by waging a
battle in the higher realms, as
many channels from the lower dimensions, that have gained some
popularity in Internet, suggest. What is currently happening on this
planet is a dramatic increase in the frequencies of earth and humanity
that render the actions of the dark ones futile from an energetic point
of view, no matter how many efforts they may undertake.
Darkness has to succumb to Light prior to Ascension. Under the
condition of destructive interference Darkness will be deleted and
substituted by Light. It is as simple as that. Only human mind wants
things to be much more complicated, as to experience its fake autarky to
the full extent.
This pattern can be observed in the behavior of most incarnated
entities. Their ego may choose to go along a certain path of experience
that is not shared by the higher self. As the free will of the ego is
respected by the soul, the entity may proceed with the realization of
his intentions for some time. In this case he will eventually experience
one failure after another, one disaster after another, until he starts
to contemplate as to why he has no success in creating the destiny he
desires.
The entity will eventually begin to scrutinize his beliefs and emotions
that have urged him to choose this particular path of experience and he
may find out that they are not as honorable and spiritually elevated, as
they initially seemed to be. He will them begin to question his motives
and will substitute them with more loving and compassionate thoughts and
feelings.
By doing so throughout his life and during
numerous incarnations, the entity reaches the ultimate point of
3d-existence, where he acts most of the time from the position of
unconditional love, compassion, and maximal under-standing, which is the
position of the soul.
When this point is reached, the soul may decide that she has learned
all the lessons of incarnation and separation, she intended to
experience. The soul will no longer need her external reference point of
observation - the ego. It will be put aside forever, and the incarnation
cycle of the soul will be terminated. The infinite journey of the soul
will continue on a higher dimension on her way back to the Source, but
her earthly experiences will remain her treasures forever.
The gradual return of the prodigal son to the Father is accompanied by
a series of negative experiences summarized as karma, whereas, in fact,
these are experiences of the conditions of destructive interference that
help the entity to evolve to a responsible creator.
The best way for an
incarnated entity to learn this is to experience personally the
consequences of his creativity. Human destiny has no other purpose, but to
give the entity amidst his total amnesia vital clues that he is a spark
of God.
Anything that human entities experience on earth is part of their
conscious choice of Creation at a higher level. The Powers That Be are
thus not evil aliens that have invaded earth at some point in time to
oppress and annihilate humanity. They have already been part of the
game, before some souls from the 5th dimension decided to incarnate on
earth and have this particular experience with these 4d-creatures.
The eschatological purpose of these souls
was to find out, what they did not like - ultimately, the consequences
and manifestations of total separation as mirrored by the behavior of
the Unholy Six, to which they have subjected themselves on this planet
in a conscious and deliberate manner.
Their hallucinatory enslavement will end at the very moment, at which
they decide to end up this game of illusion and renounce enslavement.
They do not need to fight the dark ones and their human proxies in order
to liberate themselves. This is the lesson that the Egyptian people are
now learning. This will be the lesson that the American nation will have
to learn this year as part of the overall liberation and enlightenment
of mankind.
Let us not forget that the USA is still the citadel of the dark forces,
from where they have effectively enslaved humanity for the last 60-70
years after the Second World War. The other citadel of evil, the Soviet
Union, has already crumbled and is now fully under the auspices of the
Forces of Light, as any discerning observer can easily find out by
analyzing the current political events and the tone of the mass media in
these two countries.
Human entities are powerful creators. As soon as they make a conscious
decision to return to the Source as responsible creators, it will be so.
The greatest surprise, any human being will
experience after Ascension in the 5th dimension, will be to find out
that he is one of infinite other responsible creators, and that there is
nothing else in All-That-Is but Creation.
