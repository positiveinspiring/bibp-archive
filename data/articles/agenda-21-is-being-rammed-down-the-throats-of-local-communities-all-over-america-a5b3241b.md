Have you ever heard of
Agenda 21? If not, don't feel bad, because
most Americans haven't.
It is essentially a blueprint for a "sustainable
world" that was introduced at the UN Conference on Environment and
Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. Since then, it has been
adopted by more than 200 counties and it has been modified and updated at
other UN environmental summits.
The philosophy behind Agenda 21 is that our
environmental problems are the number one problem that we are facing, and
that those problems are being caused by human activity.
Therefore, according to Agenda 21 human activity
needs to be tightly monitored, regulated and controlled for the greater
good.
Individual liberties and freedoms must be
sacrificed for the good of the planet. If you are thinking that this sounds
like it is exactly the opposite of what our founding fathers intended when
they established this nation, you would be on the right track.
Those that promote the philosophy underlying
Agenda 21 believe that human activity must be "managed" and that letting
people make their own decisions is "destructive" and "dangerous".
Sadly, the principles behind Agenda 21 are being
rammed down the throats of local communities all over America, and most of
the people living in those communities don't even realize it.
So how is this being done?
Well, after Agenda 21 was adopted, an
international organization known as the "International Council for Local
Environmental Initiatives" (ICLEI)
was established to help implement the goals of Agenda 21 in local
communities. One thing that they learned very quickly was that the "Agenda
21" label was a red flag for a lot of people. It tended to create quite a
bit of opposition on the local level.
As they try to implement their goals, they very
rarely use the term "Agenda 21" anymore. Instead, they use much more
harmless sounding labels such as,
So just because something does not carry the
Agenda 21 label does not mean that it is not promoting the goals of Agenda
21. The goals of Agenda 21 are not only being implemented in the United
States.
This is a massive worldwide effort that is being
coordinated by
the United Nations.
An article that was posted
on RedState.com discussed some of the
history of Agenda 21...
In simplified terms, Agenda 21 is a master
blueprint, or guidelines, for constructing sustainable communities.
Agenda 21 was put forth by the UNs
Commission on Sustainable Development, and was adopted by over 200
countries (signed into soft law by George Bush Sr.) at the United
Nations Rio Conference in 1992.
In 1994 the Presidents Council for
Sustainable Development was created via Executive Order by Bill Clinton
to begin coordinating efforts at the Federal level to make the US Agenda
21 compliant.
The same year that Bill Clinton
established the Presidents Council for Sustainable Development, the
International Code Council (ICC)
was also created.
The International Code Council has developed a
large number of "international codes" which are intended to replace existing
building codes all over the United States.
The following is a list of these codes from Wikipedia...
-
International Building Code
-
International Residential Code
-
International Fire Code
-
International Plumbing Code
-
International Mechanical Code
-
International Fuel Gas Code
-
International Energy Conservation Code
-
ICC Performance Code
-
International Wildland Urban Interface
Code
-
International Existing Building Code
-
International Property Maintenance Code
-
International Private Sewage Disposal
Code
-
International Zoning Code
-
International Green Construction Code
These codes are very long and exceedingly
boring, and those that write them know that hardly anyone will ever read
them.
And for the most part, they contain a lot of
things that are contained in existing building codes or that are common
sense. But a lot of poison has also been inserted into these codes. If you
read them carefully, the influence of Agenda 21 is painfully obvious.
Unfortunately, even most of the local
politicians that are adopting these codes don't take the time to read them.
Most of them just assume that they are "updating" their existing building
codes.
So what often happens is that there will be
fights in local communities between citizens that are concerned about the
encroachment of Agenda 21 and local politicians who regard such talk as
nonsense.
The following is an example of what is happening
all over the nation...
Summit Hill Borough Council last night
unanimously adopted the "2012 edition of the International Property
Maintenance Code," but not before some audience members expressed
vehement opposition to it.
An overflow crowd of 34 people attended the
meeting, with some there to specifically voice their displeasure.
Sandy Dellicker, a borough resident, said
she was against using an "international" maintenance code, arguing that
it falls under the plan of Agenda 21 of the United Nations; an agenda
for the 21st Century.
She said,
"UN Agenda 21/Sustainable Development is
the action plan to inventory and control all land, all water, all
minerals, all plants, all animals, all construction, all means of
production, all information, all energy, and all human beings in the
world."
"This is not a conspiracy theory," she
told the council. "This is for real."
She said the International Property
Maintenance Code had been adopted in Montgomery County, but the county
"has already gotten rid of it" because of its dictatorial direction.
"This is not what Summit Hill and the
United States is about," she said.
Council members pooh-poohed her assessment.
"In my opinion, the International
Property Maintenance Code is to protect citizens," said Council
President Michael Kokinda.
It would be great if these codes were just about
public safety. But that is simply not the case.
Sadly, these codes are often used to fine or
even imprison homeowners that haven't done anything wrong. Sometimes "code
violations" are even used as justification to legally steal property from
law-abiding homeowners.
A post on
the Freedom Reigns Radio blog detailed some
of the things that are often done in the name of "code enforcement"...
-
The Code Official - anybody the
jurisdiction calls - a Code Official - is the sole interpreter
- no due process - Gestapo!
-
Every day an offense occurs is a
separate mandatory misdemeanor - $555/day and/or a month in jail
in Charleston, W.Va. They can fine you out of your home and jail
you at their whim!
-
Anything the Code Official says is
not in good working condition - sticky window, dented or plugged
gutter, torn window screen - whatever he says is not in good
working order - hundreds of dollars of fines per day and/or jail
time - usually a month - for every day the offense occurs.
-
Any unsanitary condition - whatever
the Code Official says is an unsanitary condition - empty
pop cans - puddles - dog droppings on your property - same deal
- same fines and/or jail time - every day.
-
Any plant that the Code Official
says is a noxious weed - same deal - same fines and/or jail
time - every day. He can steal raw land.
-
He can fine you out of your home and
jail you with no due process. Any court proceedings are window
dressing as there is no remedy associated with this code.
-
It can be adopted - just by an
administrative decree.
WITHOUT COURT ACTION OR NOTICE THE CODE
OFFICIAL CAN:
-
Enter your house whenever he - the
sole interpreter - deems reasonable.
-
Prevent you from entering your
house.
-
Tear your house down with your stuff
in it.
-
Bill you for the demolition.
-
Place a lien on it for fines and/or
demolition charges - steal it.
-
And best of all, no insurance I
know of will cover your losses.
Youre left w/a house and your stuff in a
landfill - and any remaining unpaid mortgage, any remaining fines, any
remaining taxes, and any remaining demolition charges after they steal
your property
These codes restrict what homeowners can do with
their own properties in thousands of different ways. If you rebel against
one of the codes, the penalties can be extremely harsh.
And there is often "selective enforcement" of
these codes. That means that they will leave most people alone but they will
come down really hard on people that they do not like. You could even end up
with a SWAT team on your doorstep.
Just ask some of the people who have been
through this kind of thing.
Even if you have your mortgage completely paid
off, that doesn't mean that you really "own" your property. If you don't pay
your taxes and obey the "codes", you could lose your property very rapidly.
The philosophy behind all of this is the same
philosophy behind Agenda 21.
The
elite believe that you cannot be trusted to do the "right thing"
with your own property and that your activity must be "managed" for the
greater good. They believe that by controlling you and restricting your
liberties that they are "saving the planet".
Unfortunately, you can probably expect this to
get a whole lot worse in the years ahead. Our society is shifting from one
that cherishes individual liberties and freedoms to one that is fully
embracing collectivism.
So our politicians will likely be making even
more of our decisions for us as the years move forward.
