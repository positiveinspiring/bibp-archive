On July 13, the
New York Times ran a story about the CIA
running an assassination squad using U.S military special forces against
foreign terrorists without Congressional approval on the orders of former
Vice President Dick Cheney.
The Times story confirms claims by
Seymour Hersh in March 2009 that an
assassination squad had been created that reported directly to Cheney using
special forces personnel.

The covert CIA project was shut down by CIA
Director Leon Panetta when he learned of it on June 23.
Details of
the project were passed on the next day to the U.S. Congress and led to
furor over the reports. A
statement by seven members of the House
Intelligence Committee concerning the CIA misleading Congress was
subsequently released. The covert CIA program allegedly began in 2001 soon
after the 911 attacks.
The unfolding revelations of CIA death squads
using U.S. military special forces personnel coincides with the online
release of video testimony of a former U.S. Navy SEAL who said he was
recruited to perform 18 assassination assignments for the CIA. If true, the
SEALs testimony reveals that covert assassinations predate
the 911 attacks,
and also targeted U.S. citizens.
Curiously, the assassinations were related to
covert projects Dick Cheney was allegedly involved in when he was Secretary
of Defense for
George H.W. Bush from 1989 to 1993.
Connor ORyan was a pseudonym used by Derek Hennessy who claims in video
testimony recorded in 1991, that he performed covert missions for the CIA in
the 1980s assassinating enemies of the United States. After joining the U.S.
Navy in the early 1980s, ORyan/Hennessy claims he joined the elite SEALs
and was eventually tasked to perform his covert assassination missions.
He
said that targets of the assassination hits even included U.S. citizens.
He described his 18th and final mission as a
sergeant for the U.S. Army Green Berets stationed at the U.S. Embassy in
Budapest, Hungary.
ORyans/Hennessys extraordinary claims were investigated over a ten year
period by a retired Lt Colonel with the U.S. Air Force,
Wendelle Stevens.
During his investigation, Stevens was able to confirm Hennessys military
I.D. and that he was assigned to the CIA performing covert missions.
Concerned that ORyan/Hennessy may have been part of an intelligence
operation to discredit him, Stevens did not release the initial results of
his investigation until 2001.
Video testimony of ORyan/Hennessy is included
in a set of interviews conducted with Stevens
currently being released on
the internet. In the interviews, Stevens discussed documents he had in his
possession verifying Hennessys covert CIA missions.
One document was apparently written on CIA
letter head (see above graphic) with instructions for O/Ryan/Hennessy on his
last mission. Stevens read out the documents contents as follows:
You are to report to the American Embassy
in Budapest, Hungary. You will be received by S.A. Greywolf. As a unit
you will proceed to terminate an ex S.A. David T. Johnson.
According to Stevens, the document was ORyans/Hennessys
final hit order one month before he left his final assignment at a secret
facility in Nevada.
Another document is ORyans/Hennessys W-2
salary statement that showed he was earning $74,000 for the CIA. Though only
a sergeant he was earning the equivalent of a colonels salary at the time.
Stevens was able to confirm that the serial number and code word on the W-2
were active through an anonymous FBI source.
On the video Stevens mistakenly
refers to the salary statement as a W-4, but a copy of the W-2 is clearly
shown (see slide show below) .
Combined with ORyans/Hennessys recorded video testimony, the documents,
if genuine, would be smoking gun evidence that a CIA assassination squad
using U.S. military personnel predated 2001 and even targeted U.S. citizens.
To date, neither of the documents has been released to the public. Only
video images are available. Independent document authentication still has to
be conducted.
The confirmation of the W-2 by an anonymous FBI contact of Stevens is
powerful support for the legitimacy of OBrians/Hennessys story. There is
good reason, however, to be skeptical about the CIA hit order documents
legitimacy. It is difficult to accept that the CIA would be so explicit in
putting on CIA stationary orders to terminate a serving U.S. military
non-commissioned officer.
One could reasonably argue that such orders, if
put on paper, would be done in a more cryptic manner without the CIA logo.
This would be consistent with an
Assassination Directive that former CIA
Director Allen Dulles allegedly drafted in 1961, and was later authorized by
a group responsible for covert operations called
Majestic-12.
The alleged Dulles Assassination Directive used
the cryptic phrase it should be wet as a code word for assassinations
designed to protect Majestic-12 operations.
If indeed there has been a CIA assassination program that predates 2001, it
may originate from Dulles 1961 draft Assassination Directive. The directive
was allegedly received by the chief of CIA counterintelligence, James Jesus
Angleton in 1961, and subsequently linked to the
President Kennedy
Assassination. If OConnor/Hennessy did eliminate a serving Green Beret in
Budapest in 1991 as he claims, then the authority for such an assassination
may derive from Dulles 1961 draft Assassination Directive.
If ORyans/Hennessys CIA hit order letter is a hoax, that raises an
equally perplexing question. Why would Wendelle Stevens, a long time
researcher of the UFO phenomenon, be targeted in an elaborate intelligence
operation to discredit him with a contrived story about CIA assassins using
elite military special forces personnel in 1991? ORyan/Hennessy spent an
extended period hiding with Stevens and associates while allegedly on the
run.
During this time, a series of events occurred
that persuaded those giving shelter to ORyan/Hennessy that he was genuinely
being monitored and threatened to return voluntarily to his program.
Eventually, ORyan/Hennessy disappeared and has never been heard of again.
If ORyans/Hennessys testimony is even partially correct, as Stevens
confirmation of his W-2 suggests, it would confirm the existence of an
assassination team run by the CIA prior to 2001. His testimony reveals that
even U.S. citizens were eliminated due to agendas of a highly classified
covert operations run out of the CIA. ORyan/Hennessy himself apparently
become a target when he shared his information with Stevens and this may
have been related to his disappearance.
For the last nine months of his military service during his final
assassination missions, Hennessy was assigned to a covert facility in Nevada
called S-4 to perform sentry duty for a highly classified covert project.
It
was there that he witnessed Dick Cheney arrive one day for an inspection for
a project maintaining the secrecy of which was related to his earlier
assassination missions.

Cheney taken inside S-4 to view flying saucers & EBE

Around April 1991, Dick Cheney was taken inside
a secret underground facility located in a remote area in Nevada adjacent to Nellis Air Force base to view captured flying saucers and dead
extraterrestrial bodies.
The startling claims were made by a former security
guard at the facility who in October 1991 gave his testimony on video. The
guard had documents and photos supporting his claims of working on the
secret facility called S-4.
The guard, Derek Hennessy, used the pseudonym Connor ORyan in giving his
testimony in a set of interviews with Lt Col Wendelle Stevens (USAF, ret.)
and his associate Gem Cox. ORyan/Hennessy claims he had worked for 8/9
years as a Navy SEAL and performed various covert operations. He said that
18 of these missions were assassinations sanctioned by the CIA or other
agencies.
During the last nine months of his military
service in 1991, he worked at the remote S-4 facility which had stringent
security procedures. It appeared that the isolation and security at S-4
helped assassins hide their trail after missions.
ORyan/Hennessy described his work on the second level of the S-4 facility.
S-4 employed approximately 75 personnel on levels 1 and 2. He said he was
aware of a further two levels of the facility, but was never allowed to
enter levels 3 and 4. He said that approximately 12-15 personnel worked at
Levels 3 & 4. His primary duty was to guard the elevators to them which
required three keys, a thumbprint and a retinal scan to open.
ORyan/Hennessy described the hangar facilities on level two for storing the
seven flying saucers retrieved from various crash sites. There were ten
hangar bays in total. The facility was described as the museum suggesting
it was designed to store advanced extraterrestrial technologies that had
been superseded. He revealed how one or more of the flying saucers would be
raised to the surface for a flight test.
This would only occur when no Russian or other
spy satellites were passing overhead. All testing would stop when satellites
were detected.
He also described seven tubes with bodies of extraterrestrial biological
entities (EBEs) typically described as
Grays.
A biologist would regularly
check the fluids to maintain the right temperature and fluid mix to maintain
the bodies. In addition to the photos he showed to two witnesses, ORyan/
Hennessy drew pictures in his taped interview describing the facilities.
ORyan/Hennessy described the day Cheney visited as around the time when the
U.S. was closing military bases at the end of the Cold War. Cheney was
accompanied by three other officials and escorted by two base security
personnel. He said Cheney only visited the first two levels of the S-4
facility and saw both the flying saucers and the bodies of dead
extraterrestrials.
ORyan/Hennessy said:
I was on level two at the time of his visit
and I watched him go in and he went into the back building and we were
called up to guard the front of the hangar areas
He saw the bodies
too - the seven little grey people
A supercomputer and photo analysis expert, Jim Dilettoso, allowed ORyan/Hennessy to stay at his property for a month.
Dilettoso said ORyan/Hennessy showed both him
and Gem Cox photographs allegedly taken at S-4. He saw photos of what
appeared to be extraterrestrial vehicles, and extraterrestrial bodies in
glass tubes. He also saw a photo with Dick Cheney standing on a balcony
allegedly inside the S-4 facility viewing the area below with the flying
saucers and bodies while OConnor/Hennessy was allegedly on duty.
Dilettoso also recognized the former Director of
the National Security Agency, Admiral Bobby Ray Inman (USN ret.) as one of
the officials in the photo with Cheney.
How credible is ORyans/Hennessys testimony?
The most significant
documentary evidence is the W-2 obtained by Stevens (see
slide show below).
The control number (45851), Employer Identification Number (95-6593572) and
Employers State ID (2464423P) were checked and confirmed by Stevens FBI
contact. According to the FBI contact, ORyan/Hennessy had been
deprogrammed and reprogrammed after being taken back in to covert programs
by the CIA and Naval intelligence on various covert assignments.
The W-2 and numbers can be investigated for
independent confirmation.
Furthermore, ORyan/Hennessy revealed many details in his video testimony to
Wendelle Stevens and Gem Cox about his background and events, that can also
be investigated for corroboration. Finally, ORyan/Hennessy stayed for a
month with supercomputer and photo analysis expert, Jim Dilettoso who along
with Cox witnessed his photos and a duty roster that ORyan/Hennessy showed
him.
Dilettoso also described a bizarre incident that changed his initial
skepticism towards ORyan//Hennessys amazing story.
Returning from a 1991 Thanksgiving party that
ORyan/Hennessy attended, Dilettoso found a package at the inside front gate
of his ranch. Thinking it was for him, Dilettoso took it. When it was later
opened, a severed finger was found along with a threatening note directed at
ORyan/Hennessy to return photos and other evidence of S-4.
Together with
other strange episodes indicating close surveillance by a mysterious group
of people, Dilettoso decided it was time for ORyan/Hennessy to leave.
ORyan/Hennessy says he decided to come forward after he was told that he
had contracted a virulent form of Hodgkins disease. Being 29 at the time,
and in good health with no history of the disease in his family, he
suspected that he was being set up for elimination. In retaliation, he
decided to become a whistleblower and release photographs taken at S-4.
ORyan//Hennessys remarkable testimony, if substantiated, clearly reveals
that Richard Cheney while Secretary of Defense, had directly witnessed S-4,
and covert programs involving extraterrestrial life and technology.
That may explain why
George Bush deferred to
Cheney during the 2000 Presidential Campaign on a question concerning when
UFO information would be released:
"It will be the first thing he (pointing to
Cheney) will do. He'll get right on it."
Alas, after a tumultuous eight years as
Vice-President, Cheney never chose to disclose anything about his alleged
visit to S-4, and knowledge of extraterrestrial life and technology.
