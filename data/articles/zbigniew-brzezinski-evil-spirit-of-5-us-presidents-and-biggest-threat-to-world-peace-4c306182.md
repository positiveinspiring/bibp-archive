Summary
There is a man who is more dangerous to mankind
than any other living person today. His name is Zbigniew Brzezinski,
a
CFR-member , Arch-Trilateral
Commissionist,
Bilderberger. He has been the evil spirit
behind 5 US presidents, including
Obama
- and he is obsessed with but one thought: The US is to dominate a communist
one world state.
For that purpose, he sees Eurasia as his grand
chessboard, where the battle is to be won. Like any chess player, he starts
by occupying the centre of the chessboard, Central Asia.
He wants peace there, friendly arrangements, in
particular with China, if possible, so that he can pursue the goal of his
obsession, i.e. the purpose of the Trilateral Commission created by him and
David Rockefeller: To create a world
state by fusing a coming North American Union, at which he is working
through the CSIS, the Union for the Mediterranean - and a Far East block
which is now being created.
His aim is a communist one world state where
Russia, which he hates, is subdued by being split into 3 republics in a
loose confederation - and if that is not possible - then ultimately even by
WW III. He and David Rockefeller are behind the fusion of world religions
for peace in the world state. In stead he collaborates with Al Gore and
Gorbachev to promote the environmental Gaia religion.
In the Agenda 21 state people in the
technetronic era will be totally controlled and via artificial intelligence
(brain chipping) become post-human robots.
He has worked on,
-
selling US infrastructure like harbours
-
outsourcing US jobs
-
giving the Panama Canal to the Chinese
-
selling illegal weapons to the Soviet,
Iran, Iraq, Libya
He nurtured the Taliban and Al Qaida and ignored
Islamic fundamentalism.
Advised by Zbigniew and his son, Ian, Obama is
now encircling Russia and China, which has not been so cooperative as wanted
by Zbigniew, with anti-ballistic missiles which can also be used to
inactivate Russian and Chinese satellites, so as to hinder retaliation after
a US first strike against the nuclear arsenals of those countries.
Russia knows and is preparing for the
possibility of having to deliver a preemptive attack - according to the
chief of the Russian Joint Staff, Yuri Baluyevsky. These
considerations are probably being accentuated by the fact that Russia can
hardly afford a fresh weapons race.
However, Brzezinski does not believe in Russia's
capacity to strike!
Who is Zbigniew
Brzezinski?
See this video: Brzezinski is the promoter of a
Communist Obama who is for a social change in the US and to end the Iraq war
and redefines security.
I have previously written about him and his vision for the world: The
Grand Chessboard. Zbigniew Brzezinski has been called Obama's
Rasputin.

The following is very weird and one wonders
that one man has had so much influence on world affairs. Much of it is
confirmed by
Wikipedia.
Zbigniew Brzezinski is Barack Obamas foreign
policy advisor.
Brzezinski was the national security advisor for
President Carter from 1977 to 1981. In 1988 he endorsed HW Bush for
President and was Co-Chair of the HW Bush national security advisory task
force. From 1987 to 1989 he also served on the HW Bushs Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board. Clinton Secretary of State Madeline Albright
was a student of Brzezinski's.
GW Bush Secretary of State, Condi Rice (also a
former national security advisor), who studied under Albrights father,
shares many of the same world government views with Brzezinski and Albright.
Zbigniew Brzezinski is an advocate of socialist world government, a goal he
has promoted as a member of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) to guide policy makers and as a speaker at former Soviet
Premier and Communist Mikhail Gorbachevs first World Forum.
This State of the World Forum had interesting
partners. Brzezinski is an architect of creating regions of global
governance from independent nations to achieve world government. The CSIS
issues the North American Integration Monitor, which hopes for a North
American Union (NAU).
The proposals for global taxes by Obama have
come with the recommendations of Zbigniew Brzezinski to pay for
globalization and world government. Obama has proposed a global poverty tax
in a US Senate bill.
The Climate Change Control Bill strongly
supported by Obama calls for an international governing regime to monitor
and regulate carbon dioxide and carbon footprints from discovery, to
production, to consumption at a cost of $50 trillion globally and at a cost
of $8 trillion for US taxpayers, all to be paid for by a global tax, whose
monies will be used to establish a world government body.
Obama's puppeteers,
the Trilateral Commissionists, Zbigniew Brzezinski
and David Rockefeller.
Obama, Brzezinski and
Al Gore have worked closely with Communist backed
environmental fronts led by Gorbachev (proponent of Earth Charter, author of
Manifesto for Earth), to promote the falsehood of significant global climate
change due to manmade sources of greenhouse gases to scare the world and the
US into paying such a global tax to save the planet.
Obamas longstanding ties with Communist, Marxist and Islamic terror mentors
in the US have been well documented in the US and world press. What many do
not know but need to know is that Zbigniew Brzezinski represents another one
of these Islamic terror, socialistic, world government and Marxist mentors
of ObamaÂ´s.
Brzezinski openly praises Marxism in his book Between Two Ages published in
1970 - in which he describes man's behavior and mind to be totally
controlled, people having artificial intelligence (brain chipping) in a "technetronic"
dictatorship. Incidentally Brzezenskis father was an ambassador to Russia
from Poland during Stalins reign and Zbigniew worked to protect and defend
some East German intelligence agents of Stasi some of whose former members
later worked to
enable the 9/11 hijackers and other Islamic terrorists
(Hamburg cell of Atta, Alshehhi and Jarrah - hardly correct).
Brzezinski has dual US and Polish citizenship.
Council on Foreign Relations member, Bilderberger, Zbigniew Brzezinski
co-founded the Trilateral Commission (TC) with David Rockefeller in 1973 and
was its first director.
Brzezinski selected Jimmy Carter as a member
while Carter was the governor of Georgia and before Carter became US
President. TC is the primary organization managing the goals of
globalization to achieve world government via manipulations of economies,
politics and religions of nations around the world including the US.
According to Dr.
Dennis Cuddy, Brzezinski, as TC director, advocated,
in a 1973 memo, establishing means for social control over the world
populations by deliberate,
economic and political destabilization so
that later the debt leash could be used to strangle a rebellious nation
into submission (to global governance).
The TC, Rice and Brzezenski have actively
promoted illegal immigration and non-enforcement of US immigration laws to
advance the NAU (North
American Union).
They have promoted foreign control of the US by
facilitating the sell off of US infrastructure and companies to foreign
governments including those from the EU, China, Russia and Islamic terror
nations.
Brzezinski, Rice, the TC and their socialist friends have intentionally
helped destabilize the US economy by devaluating the US dollar through the
sending of US jobs overseas. They are trying to control the US energy
economy via the Climate Change Control bills and to prevent US energy
independence (which would stop the devaluation of the dollar) by calling for
curtailing and drastically controlling production of oil.
Zbigniew Brzezinskis contrived leash is not
limited just to money and capital; it includes controlling populations, and
nations by controlling,
The world government socialists like Brzezinski and Obama are promoting a
new order of religions, an amalgamation of
religions to unify and control
populations and nations.
They are including in their new order umbrella
of religions Islamic aspirations for a world caliphate, Communitarianistic
and New Age beliefs, the Gaia (mother Earth) religion of environmentalists
exploited by the Communists, by
Al Gore (the tree hugger) and by those
who worship the created rather than the creator.
Brzezinski worked with Republican globalists like
Kissinger and US
Senator Henry Bellmon (OK) to give the Panama Canal away ultimately
for Communist Chinese control (Carter-Torrijos Treaties). Under Carter,
Brzezinski was responsible for the severing of direct US recognition of
Taiwan as an independent nation and recognizing only Communist China.
As soon as Carter became President Brzezinski started to illegally
manipulate the export control list to enable advanced US computer, military
(guidance systems), energy (nuclear; coal, oil shale, tar sands conversion
and synthetic fuels) technologies to be transferred and sold by US companies
(such as Control Data, GE and Union Carbide) to the Soviet Union.
Brzezinski with Osama bin
Laden during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan!
On February 2, 1979, Brzezinski wrote a memo to
Carter falsely claiming that Islamic fundamentalism was not an imminent
threat and would not gain prominence in the Middle East.
Brzezinski was the architect of the formation of
US CIA and Saudi training and funding for the Afghan mujaheddin network,
some of which would later form the Taliban and would shelter Al Qaeda
terrorists camps.
Brzezinski, along with Clintons NSC advisor
Anthony Lake, John McCain, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich, was a proponent of
using the Saudis and CIA to directly fund the AlQaeda and Iranian arming and
training in and outside the US of Islamic terrorists from Albania, Kosovo
and Bosnia to kick out the Serbs and Croats.
Some of these same terrorists became the 9/11
hijackers?? Carter and Bzezinski are and have been diplomats at large
along with Boren for Hamas terrorists in the Middle East and US as reflected
in Obamas pro-Islamic foreign policies.
Zeit Kritiker: Brzezinski is Obama's puppeteer
Even during the tenure of G.W. Bush, Brzezinski took over key sectors of the
U.S. government.
Since then, the danger of a confrontation between the
United States with Russia, China, Sudan, Pakistan and more recently with
Iran and Yemen has highly increased. The aggression of the U.S. toward Iran,
ultimately aims at a confrontation with Russia and China.
"The
Grand Chessboard" dissipates any doubt: The
US is to dominate all Eurasia. Then American high finance would in effect be
in control of 70 percent of the oil and gas reserves - in order to secure
American primacy for a long time. With Obama as a puppet of the Trilateral
Commission, Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller see this goal within
reach.
Moscow is well aware of this situation, the fear of Brzezinski's finger on
the nuclear button does not leave Russia inactive: The Chief of the Russian
General Staff, Yury Baluyevsky announced in January 2008,
"Russia would revise its nuclear doctrine,
so that a nuclear first strike in certain situations would be possible."
(WG Tarpley, Barack Obama - How a U.S.
President is Made p. 166).
Brzezinski and his followers are so obsessed
with America as the sole superpower that they are willing to take the risk
of World War III. That should be clear to everyone.
Brzezinski - A Geostrategy for Eurasia
Foreign Affairs
September/October
1997
A power that dominated Eurasia would exercise
decisive influence over two of the world's three most economically
productive regions.
A glance at the map also suggests that a country
dominant in Eurasia would almost automatically control the Middle East and
Africa. With Eurasia now serving as the decisive geopolitical chessboard.
Brzezinski wants understanding with China - and wants to weaken Russia by
splitting her into 3 republics.
Any expansion of Europe's political scope is
automatically an expansion of U.S. influence. America must be careful not to
alienate Turkey. America should use its influence in Europe to encourage
Turkey's eventual admission to the EU.
In addition, it is not in America's interest to
perpetuate U.S.-Iranian hostility.
The core of the new transcontinental
security framework could be a standing committee composed of the major
Eurasian powers, with America, Europe, China, Japan, a confederated Russia,
and India collectively addressing critical issues for Eurasia's stability.
Comment: This is the idea of the Trilateral Commission founded by Brzezinski
and David Rockefeller
Brzezinski's legacy
Brzezinski told Polish Radio (26
Jan. 2009) that there are no other options than aggression when dealing with
Moscow, speaking of the anti-missile shield.
Global Research
3 February 2010
With or without Brzezinski's advise, Obama is
now provoking both Russia, China and Iran by sale of of sophisticated
ground-to-air missiles to Poland, various weaponry for Taiwan and
anti-missile defense systems to 4 Gulf States.
A fresh provocation against Russia was reported
on 5 February by the EUObserver: The US
will set up its anti missile shield (against Iran?) in Romania and in the
Black Sea.
Global Res.
5 Febr. 2010
These same Army Patriot Advanced Capability-3
(PAC-3) systems are going to be deployed in Taiwan as the U.S. continues its
military encirclement of China. U.S. PAC-3 systems have already been
deployed in Japan and South Korea. News that the U.S. is about to deploy a
PAC-3 missile battery in Poland led Russia's ambassador to NATO, Dmitry
Rogozin, to recently state: "Do they really think that we will calmly watch
the location of a rocket system, at a distance of 60 km from Kaliningrad?"
The official authorization of Patriot transfers to Taiwan - the missiles are
produced by Raytheon Company headquartered in Massachusetts, whose former
vice president of Government Operations and Strategy William Lynn is now
Obama's Deputy Secretary of Defense - resulted in China's vice foreign
minister, He Yafei, saying
"We believe this move endangers China's
national security."
The strategy is clear. Surround Russia and China
with mobile "missile defense" systems whose job is to take out their
retaliatory capability after a U.S. first-strike against their nuclear
weapons.
All this means one thing - an extended arms race
with Russia and China which will mean huge profits for the weapons industry.
And Brzezinski?
Global Res.
15 Aug. 2008
Obamas foreign policy team in addition to
father Zbigniew Brzezinski, includes Brzezinskis son, Ian Brzezinski,
current US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO
Affairs.
Ian Brzezinski is a devout backer of US
missile defense policy, as well as Kosovo independence and NATO expansion
into Ukraine and Georgia.
The Brzezinskis.
Ian Brzezinski left. They are
a mortal danger to the world.
Comment
Brzezinski's big idea is the necessity for the USA to dominate the world.
He
will do so by means of his child, the Trilateral Commission's, aim, i.e. fusioning a North American Union, which he is creating through the CSIS, the
Union for the Mediterranean and an East Asian bloc, which is being
constructed.
US domination of Eurasia is a must. Therefore, US is now occupying the
centre of the chessboard, Central Asia at any cost, even World War III.
And he might have it soon in case Russia and China are unable to participate
in a new armament race.
He underestimates Russia as a nuclear power
capable of delivering a first strike catastrophically. Unauthorized Obama
biographer, Webster Tarpley, says on
this
video that Brzezinski will spare Iran and use the US forces in a
war against Russia!!
Here Tarpley tells about Brzezinski
admitting on French TV, that he lured the Soviet Union to invade
Afghanistan.
Islamic fundamentalism as a threat to the world:
Nonsense says Brzezinski.
He is willing to use any means to provoke war
with Russia, which he hates.
Here is a view that supports him:
AG Friedensforschung der UniversitÃ¤t Kassel:
What course of events would history take if
American and European geo-politicians without taking the new
distribution of power into consideration would, in fact, stick to the
plan of primacy in Eurasia? In this case a clash between different great
powers would occur whether as a cold or a hot war.
This may be what US Vice-President, Joe Biden,
and Colin Powell meant.
In fact, after the Georgian-Russian war, Brzezinski
did see Russia as a military hindrance to US Dominance in Eurasia below video.
