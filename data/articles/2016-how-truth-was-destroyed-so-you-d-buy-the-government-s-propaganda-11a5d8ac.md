# 2016 - How Truth was Destroyed So You'd Buy the Government's Propaganda

Perhaps the most laughable
Fake News came to us
courtesy of CNN's Chris
Cuomo, who
warned the planet amid ongoing publication by Wikileaks
of documents deleterious to the credibility of the
Democratic establishment to,
"remember, it's illegal to
possess these stolen documents. It's different for the
media. So everything you learn about this, you're
learning from us."
Cuomo's conspicuous ploy to
limit the spread of the actual documents - and win CNN
additional reader- and viewership - constituted a reckless
foray into censorship of information.
Of course, CNN didn't proclaim
the leaked emails verboten for nothing - the outlet bears
the snarky moniker,
Clinton News Network, as its parent company, Time
Warner,
donated over $400,000 to Hillary Clinton's
campaign - and was exposed by alternative media countless
times for
cutting off reporters who dared criticize its darling
candidate or report on revealed corruption.
Further, CNN's pernicious claim
came as the documents
revealed the outlet and others colluding with the
Clinton campaign to report news portraying Democrats in a
favorable manner - of course, those who took Cuomo's warning
to heart and relied solely on the Clinton News Network would
never know that pertinent detail.
Other mainstream media outlets
who coordinated with the Clinton camp struggled to
accurately report the contents of
the Wikileaks documents -
when they bothered covering the revelations.
Corporate propaganda's spin
machine seemed to be on overdrive for the duration of the
election cycle - and has reached the level of absurdity
following Donald Trump's win.
Because, according to corporate
media - who ignored the depth of corruption exposed by
Wikileaks - the election of Trump was so anomalous,
there had to be an explanation beyond the fact the American
people didn't find Hillary qualified for the job...
Enter The
Russians
Taking cues from the era of
McCarthyism and leading the new Red Scare with a bullhorn is
the once-illustrious Washington Post, who first
posited, without any evidence sans statements from
unnamed CIA officials, that the Intelligence Community had
reached a consensus - Russian hackers had interfered in the
election to install Trump.
Famously in lockstep, the New
York Times quickly parroted the same assertion as if it were
steel truth - neither outlet, however, bothered consulting
officials from the 16 other agencies comprising the U.S.
Intelligence Community.
In actuality, no such consensus
had been reached - not even inside the CIA.
Shortly after the Post's
shameful scare piece was published, the FBI came forward to
denounce the Russian hacking theory as "fuzzy" and
"ambiguous" -
showing the lack of cohesion amongst intelligence
officials, as well as the rush to shirk blame for the lost
election.
Wikileaks, itself - the
one organization with insider information - has
vociferously and repeatedly denied their source hacked
anything, is not Russian, and that the documents were leaked
by an insider.
Nonetheless, news of the report
went viral and furthered current administration's agenda to
both paint Russia as a villain and Trump as having somehow
stolen the election.
Indeed, the utterly unproven
Russian Hackers theory provided the impetus for President
Obama to an embarrassing diplomatic meltdown this week,
announcing the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats,
sanctions, and the shuttering of two compounds owned by
Russia.
While that move could have
easily brought the two superpower nations yet closer to
military conflict, Russian President Vladimir Putin allowed
cooler heads to prevail, went against the fury of other
officials, and
announced there would be no diplomatic tit-for-tat - no
United States diplomats would be expelled from Russia.
Incidentally, the mainstream
press jumped the gun again, publishing the statements of
Russian officials claiming the country would be mirroring
moves by the U.S. - before Putin announced Russia would not
be stooping to such diplomatic pettiness.
While these points show the
unseemly power of
misinformation and make the corporate media a soft
target for ridicule, it's imperative to understand these
false and misleading news items amount to government
propaganda - the more the public buys the preferred
narrative, the easier it will be to shove unsavory
actions, including war, down our throats.
Labeling some 200
independent and alternative outlets as
Russian propagandists and Fake News was another feat
the Post underhandedly managed in 2016 - and, thanks to
its efforts,
Obama officially
wrote into law, in essence, a
Ministry of Propaganda
to putatively combat foreign State disinformation.
Of
course, considering the Post's owner, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, has
received $600 million in CIA funds, albeit
ostensibly for a stand-alone project, this hardly comes
as a shock.
With truth in the balance,
2016 seemed to be a year plucked straight from the pages
of
George Orwell's 1984 - perhaps lightly edited by
Aldous Huxley.
We don't need censorship
from Facebook's
neoliberal Fake News slayers or the U.S.
Ministry of
Truth - but in this new era of post-coherence, the
masses fell for the trick, and now believe themselves
incapable of discerning fact from fiction despite the
still-accessible, voluminous information available on
the Internet.
If the somnambulant masses
were coherent enough to see through the ploy, freedom of
speech and the press wouldn't currently hang in the
balance.
An idiotic need to be spoon fed information
could quash the institutions at the heart of our
supposedly-free society.
However, until the
government acts more drastically, we still have
independent media - whose integrity has a phenomenal
track record of refusing to publish bogus information,
or retracting any items later found to be mistaken.
In the very near future -
without hawk-like vigilance - dissenting opinion and
reports accurately depicting corruption endemic in
government may become a thing purely of the past...
