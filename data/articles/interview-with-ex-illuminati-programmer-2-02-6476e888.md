# Interview with Ex Illuminati Programmer 2 - 02

A: It doesn't upset me to write on the topic of
the Illuminati, I
was explaining why I write under a pen name, that is all.
I received a letter recently in which it was alleged that I write
under a pen name because I'm a phony, which is not true at all. I am
a freelance writer on the side (I write for nursing magazines and
publications on health topics that have NOTHING to do with abuse)
and understand the need for fact checking, so no offense is taken at
your wanting to know my background. In fact, it shows you are a
responsible editor, which I admire. I have nothing to hide. My story
is 100% true.
I have gained no money for disclosing; I do NOT go on talk shows, I
am unknown and prefer it this way. I have absolutely no secondary
gain from doing this, other than the medical bills for my children,
which means I work three part-time jobs.
This is to answer the skeptics who say that people disclose for:
sympathy (I don't want any and don't need it. I made choices and
mistakes in my life, and am now involved in restitution); money (I
earn $20 a MONTH for my site on
Suite 101. I earn $150 to $250 an
article when I write on Women's health. Guess which topic I write on
more frequently? Yep. Women's health, on completely non-abuse
issues. The editors of the Nursing magazines and women's magazines
don't know about the other topic I write on, another reason I write
under a pen name.) I don't write for fame. Instead, if my co-workers
knew about my past, I risk losing my job. I have everything to lose
by disclosing, everything to gain by being silent.
But I also know that this kind of child abuse must be stopped. As a
Christian, and as one who stands against child abuse, I have decided
to speak out against cult abuse by writing articles that expose it.
I also know that there are a number of people outspoken on this
topic who have published, and they could possibly be back-up
information for you. I don't know any of them, since I have no
contact with other survivors other than my own family, but it is a
possibility.
Anyway, to your questions:
Q: Svali, I think our readers are wondering 'Is the Illuminati a
religion, secret society, satanism or is it a combination of it, or
something different all together, or more sinister?'
A:
The Illuminati is a group that practices a form of faith known as
"enlightenment". It is Luciferian, and they teach their followers
that their roots go back to the ancient mystery religions of
Babylon, Egypt, and Celtic druidism. They have taken what they
consider the "best" of each, the foundational practices, and joined
them together into a strongly occult discipline. Many groups at the
local level worship ancient deities such as "El", "Baal", and "Ashtarte",
as well as "Isis and Osiris" and "Set".
This said, the leadership councils at times scoff at the more
"primitive" practices of the anarchical, or lower levels. I remember
when I was on council in San Diego, they called the high priests and
priestesses the "slicers and dicers", who kept the "lower levels
happy". This is not to offend anyone, it only shows that at the
leadership levels, they often believe they are more scientifically
and cognitively driven. But they still practice the principles of
enlightenment.
There are 12 steps to this, also known as "the 12 steps of
discipline" and they also teach traveling astral planes, time
travel, and other metaphysical phenomena. Do people really do this,
or is it a drug induced hallucination ? I cannot judge. I saw things
that I believe cannot be rationally explained when in this group,
things that frightened me, but I can only say that it could be a
combination of cult mind control, drug inductions, hypnosis, and
some true demonic activity. How much of each, I cannot begin to
guess. I do know that these people teach and practice evil.
At the higher levels, the group is no longer people in robes
chanting in front of bonfires. Leadership councils have
administrators who handle finances (and trust me, this group makes
money. That alone would keep it going even if the rest were just
religious hog wash).
The leadership levels include businessmen, bankers, and local
community leaders. They are intelligent, well educated, and active
in their churches. Above local leadership councils are the regional
councils, who give dictates to the groups below them, help form the
policies and agendas for each region, and who interact with the
local leadership councils.
At the national level, there are extremely wealthy people who
finance these goals and interact with the leaders of other
countries. The Illuminati are international. Secret? By all means.
The first thing a child learns from "family, or the Order" as they
are called, is "The first rule of the Order is secrecy". This is why
you don't hear from more survivors who get out. The lengths that
this group goes to, to terrify its members into not disclosing, is
unbelievable.
I have seen set ups (oh, yes, they set up fake deaths, etc. ) where
a person was "burned alive" to teach the children not to tell. They
are told that this is a traitor, who disclosed, and now he is being
punished. (The person wasn't really a traitor, and is in a flame
proof vest, but the vision of a person on fire and screaming remains
with 3 and 4 year old children for a lifetime). And, when they are
adults, even if they DO leave, scenes such as this mean they won't
tell many people for fear of being traced and punished.
Because I helped create a lot of set ups as an adult trainer, I
became somewhat cynical, and have chosen to disclose as a result.
Although I do fight intense fear even now at times. Try being buried
in a wooden box for a period of time (it may have been minutes, but
to a four year old it is an eternity), and then when the lid is
lifted, being told, "if you ever tell, we'll put you back in
forever". The child will scream hysterically that they will NEVER
EVER tell. I was that child, and now I am breaking that vow made
under psychological duress. Because I don't want any other children
to go through what I did, or have seen done to others.
Yes,
the Illuminati are organized, secretive, and extremely wealthy
at its upper levels. They are not stupid, or poor people running
around dabbling with witchcraft. To see them as this is a huge
misconception.
Q: How widespread would you say this group has infiltrated our
society in terms of number of people? Are they present in every town
or city throughout North America? Do they take or recruit outsiders?
And how far does this group go to keep this knowledge secret?
A: I think I answered some of the secrecy above.
The Illuminati are
present in every major metropolitan center in the United States.
They have divided the United States up into 7 major regions, and
each has a regional council over it, with the heads of the local
councils reporting to them. They meet once every two months, and on
special occasions.
A metropolitan region may have as many as 10 to 30 groups within it,
and rural areas will often have meetings with other local groups,
and report to the metro leadership council. They almost NEVER
recruit outsiders, although ocassionally they will buy children or a
family from Asia, for example, and keep them under constant
surveillance in return for saving their life from the local Mafia.
They are threatened with being returned to this group if they ever
disclose.
They also have excellent lawyers who are well paid to help cover
their tracks. There are also people in the media paid to help keep
stories from coming out. I know of three people in San Diego who
worked for the Union Tribune who were faithful Illuminists, and who
also wrote frequent articles attacking local therapists who worked
with RA (Ritual Abuse) survivors. I remember leadership boasting
they had "run so-and-so out of town" because of a media blitz, and
being quite happy about it.
The Illuminati believe in controlling an area through its:
-
Banks and
financial institutions (guess how many sit on banking boards? You'd
be surprised)
-
Local government: guess how many get elected to local
city councils?
-
Law: children are encouraged to go to law school and
medical school
-
Media: others are encouraged to go to journalism
school, and members help fund local papers
Q: Is this the same Illuminati that was created by Adam Weishaupt in
Germany?
A: Weishaupt did not create the Illuminati, they chose him as a
figurehead and told him what to write about. The financiers, dating
back to the bankers during the times of the Templar Knights who
financed the early kings in Europe, created the Illuminati.
Weishaupt was their "go fer", who did their bidding.
Q: Do you have anymore info about the political goals, if any, of
the Illuminati?
A: This article I wrote for Suite101.com addresses it: "Are the
Illuminati taking over the world?" You can reprint it, or part of
it, as long as you give credit to Suite 101 and/or a link back to
the site.
Q: How do Illuminati members recognize each other?
A: Since it is generational, its easy. It isn't hard to recognize
one's father, mother, siblings, and neighbors and friends one has
grown up with. The Illuminati use telephone trees to contact members
when a meeting is to occur.
A month or two ahead of time, leadership council plans dates and
places for meetings for different groups under their umbrella. They
then call local leaders a week ahead of time (the high priest or
priestess). Two days ahead, these people call their head members,
who then call the people under them. A person knows their status in
the group by how far ahead of time they know a meeting date. The
lower in the group, the less they are trusted with information, and
the less "lag time" before meetings.
Sometimes, certain pieces of jewelry, such as a ruby ring or an oval
emerald, might be worn if meeting someone in a public place at a
prearranged assignation. But most accessing and contact is done
through family members or close friends.
When I lived in
San Diego, my entire family of origin and my four
closest friends were all members of the group. It wasn't hard to
reach me, to say the least. My spouse was also a member. The
Illuminati believe in arranged members, and do NOT allow their
members to marry a nonmember. If someone says their spouse isn't in
it, they aren't Illuminati, or they are in denial. This was an
unbreakable policy.
My marriage was arranged by the local leadership council to another
ranking member. I didn't want to marry him, because I didn't love
him, and I will never forget what I was told by Athena, my mentor at
the time (she held the second position on the council):
"That's for
the best, then, because he can never hurt you or control you." Or,
my mother's timeless advice given when I was 12 years old: "Never
fu-- someone lower than you. They will drag you down. Always choose
someone higher than yourself."
She was an ambitious woman, to say the least, determined that I
would do well in this very political group. I took her advice, and
Athena was my lover and protected me from some of the SOBs on
leadership in San Diego especially Jonathan, the head trainer. She
taught me his weaknesses and how to get around him, and stood up to
him for me. I wouldn't have survived otherwise.
These are NOT nice people and they use and manipulate others
viciously. They cut their eye teeth on status, power, and money. I
have given all of that up to leave, and am glad to be away from it
now, although I do miss some of my friends, and at times I miss the
respect of being a leader. But I am learning to live a whole new
life without the constant background of "family" monitoring and
telling me what to do.
Know what the hardest part of getting out was? The freedom. Not
having anyone telling me what to do. I literally went through a
period of adjustment, felt wobbly, trying to figure out what I
wanted to do. It was hard, since I was used to reflexively checking
my decisions with leadership and Jonathan and my husband.
Freedom can be difficult, believe it or not, and took quite a period
of time to adjust to. I believe that the inability to deal with it
often draws people back in. I hope this information is useful to
you.
