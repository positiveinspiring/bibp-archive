The "Rebellion" in Heaven
and
the "Fall" of Man
(More on the Dark & Light Illuminati)
This Awareness wishes to bring out another level of observation which entities may experience. This Awareness wishes to point out how the Light and Dark Forces work together for the ultimate good of humanity.
This Awareness indicates that it has been given that the rebellion in heaven as relayed by mystics and legends, whereby Lucifer took a portion of the angels from heaven and set out in rebellion against the laws of the Divine. This Awareness indicates that this action as referred to as the Fall of Man, or the Fall of the Angels; and whereby through this action, the concept of darkness was created and the results of evil as a position in consciousness for entities to wrestle with.
This Awareness indicates that in a more symbolic sense, this action represented the right of each part to experience its own individuality through its own potential growth and development, to be whatever it could be without being dependent on the Will of a Divine Creator for its every move. This Awareness indicates this action symbolically, is no different from the child being born and the rational thinking part of the mind being given the right to develop and to think and to grow and to nurture itself into a rational being, individual from the dictates of its father and mother. This Awareness indicates that this is the concept of the free will. (This Awareness indicates this may be considered by those who have deeper understanding as an illusion of free will)
This Awareness indicates that the falling angels, Lucifer and his followers, moving out into the universe of mind or consciousness, seeking to create structures and order out of an unfinished creation, an unfinished realm, -- unfinished because it did not fit into the expectations of those who were experiencing it, -- this Luciferian hierarchy of energies in this unfinished realm, as that which is the left side of the Cosmic Mind, whereas on the intuitive side of the Cosmic Mind is that which hold the creative forces. This Awareness indicates in that intuitive side, the right side of the Cosmic Mind is that force which is holistic in nature, gestalt, capable of seeing the total, seeing the infinite experience, of seeing the whole, or holy creation.
This Awareness indicates that the left side, (that of the Luciferian realm of Hades,) this left side of the Cosmic Mind is that which holds the forces of rational thinking, -- thinking which moves from line to line, thought to thought, in increments, inching toward conclusions, never quite reaching a total understanding of anything. This Awareness indicates that in ancient times, long before your modern sciences began to understand the nature of the right and left sides of the brain, the Zen masters of China and the Orient were already working with techniques, psychological techniques developed over a period of time which assisted in breaking down these structural creations, these towers of information built upon logic, built upon structure, upon civilizations of concepts and ideas; and these Zen masters, in breaking down the rational, left-side efforts to reach the absolute tower to Heaven, were doing so in order to allow the right side, (the creative side), to have the holistic experience, the total experience of What Is.
This Awareness indicates that this action by these Zen masters as reflected in their techniques, are well known in the philosophical circles of the West today. This Awareness indicates however, that many entities have not recognized that in the Christian doctrine, this same Zen principle has been applied, wherein the actions are created so that a koan, or system, the rational mind is brought up to a point of clarity beyond which it cannot move without completely falling apart. This Awareness indicates that an example of a technique is that which is often and most popularly referred to as the "sound of one hand clapping." This awareness indicates this utterly confounds the rational mind so that it cannot function.
This Awareness indicates another example as when the new student approached the Zen master and the Zen master told the student, "You may put them there," and the student said, "I have come empty handed." The Zen master then replies, "You may put them there," and the student replies, "but I have nothing to put down." The Zen master then answers, "Then you may continue holding them." This Awareness indicates these foolish statements are designed to confound the rational mind, the entity who is tirelessly trying to make sense out of the universe, to understand, to gain knowledge, to fully develop and understand everything that needs to be understood from the ground up, -- the tower of Babel built to heaven.
This Awareness indicates that wherein these towers are destroyed by these Zen masters through their koans, their tricks or whatever, the mind of the entity then becomes totally frustrated to the point where a new understanding occurs in a flash -- this through the intuitive side of the consciousness, the holistic, the right side of the brain. This Awareness indicates that this as that portion of consciousness which contains the holistic approach, as opposed to the dualistic approach to understanding.
This Awareness indicates that in the Christian doctrines, the concept of the virgin birth, the concept of resurrection, the concept of an entity having all power of a god living a life of love and sacrifice: these were designed as koans in consciousness, in the brain of humanity, whereby the logic would be fractured, would not hold up, could not be answered, could not be satisfied; but the effects of these stories, of these wavings, of these religions affects the right side of the brain of humanity and the followers of these religions, so that a new being emerges and acts and lives a life based upon these stories, as though these were to be emulated and followed as truth, even though they may not appear to be rational.
The purpose of religion, the purpose of government
This Awareness indicates that this is the purpose, and has been the purpose of religion, and the purpose of government is that which is to structure a rational system to allow the fundamental material needs to be satisfied. This Awareness indicates that the appropriate action is that which allows both sides to function side by side.
This Awareness has in the past referred to the Dark Illuminati and the Light Illuminati. This Awareness indicates that the Dark Illuminati as being likened with those referred to as the Luceferians. This Awareness indicates that these forces may be symbolized in the ancient symbol of the caduceus, wherein the black serpent is shown wrapped up toward the crossbar of a cross, and the white serpent, in opposite direction flows back and forth, also up the crossbar. This Awareness indicates the cross is the symbol of the human consciousness in its evolution and development. The dark serpent as the symbol of the magnetic, dark, rational, greed, material force moving up with understanding, with its intuitive realization of wisdom, -- this being the tree of wisdom.
This Awareness indicates that those entities in the movement of humanity in its evolution, who cling to the Dark Force seeking to find growth, salvation, achievement, accomplishment, heights of glory and power through its cells, through its molecules, through its systems, through its methods, will find the wages of these efforts result merely in death and loss. This Awareness indicates that those who link their being through identification of the white serpent, those entities will be sustained in spite of the appearance of material death, in spite of the appearance of loss of fortune. This Awareness indicates this as a symbolic lesson or message.
This Awareness indicates that in another example of this same message, the ancient teacher Kapila asked an entity, "Which would you be -- the tree which stands upon the bank of the stream, the bank of the stream which is being washed away by the stream, or the stream?" This Awareness indicates that the entity obviously recognized the importance of being identified with the stream of consciousness rather than the force and the outgrowth of material developments. This Awareness that the entity identifying with the stream of consciousness is the same entity who selects the white serpent of wisdom, the tree of wisdom, whereas the other entity is the same entity who selects the dark serpent, or the serpent of materialism, the tree of the senses, the fruit of knowledge,--the senses which teach and explain the material world, but give little information regarding the abstract and anti-material world.
This Awareness indicates that these actions of the Light and dark Forces, working side by side, mirroring each other, do have an effect upon the souls of entities; this likened unto the grain of sand in the oyster having its effect upon the flesh of the oyster, so that as time passes, the oyster in response to the irritation of the sand--the dark, negative force,--begins to build itself a pearl of great price within its flesh. This Awareness indicates this as the development of the soul, built out of the suffering caused by the Luceferian efforts and energies of the dualistic thinking mechanism of the rational mind.
The pre-planned, pre-programmed and cosmically directed scenario
This Awareness indicates that the same way may be seen in reflection on what is occurring in your present world whereby you see the efforts of that which this Awareness has referred to as the Beast attempting to set up its rule as expressed in the Book of Revelation, following the patterns as prescribed. This Awareness indicates that this as no accident: this as a pre-planned, pre-programmed and cosmically directed scenario to allow entities to have that experience in consciousness whereby the rational side of civilization reaches such an apex as to be capable of seeing the fallacy of such absolute expression.
This Awareness indicates that due to the introduction of mystical teachings, the introduction of certain drugs or hallucinogens and psychedelics that opened up new levels of consciousness for the masses of entities, the rational side of the mass mind has been shorted-out already to such a degree that the apex previously needed to bring man to that point of frustration in his "Beast trip" for the pursuit of world power and domination,--the apex cannot be reached to the same degree because of that which may be termed "premature ejaculation" of the Beast's intention and goals. This Awareness indicates that it has been losing its power since 1969, and at the same time, has been attempting to rebuild its power and potency, but is finding it more and more difficult as entities are becoming aware of its intentions and its foolishness in its efforts.
This Awareness indicates that many entities are now beginning to laugh at the whole concept of a Beast taking over, and this laughter at the Beast is also having its effect in shortening out the rational efforts of the Beast.
This Awareness indicates the entities are looking rather toward something more holistic, something that would be more satisfying to all involved, not just to the few who gain power over the masses. This Awareness indicates that therefore, what is occurring is the Beast is seeking to build its name, to emit its anti-christ, to create the world leader that holds all of the power within it, even as a sperm, seeking to find its destiny. But through the premature ejaculation, the early climaxes, the timing is thrown off: the total mismanagement, the interference of the "dirty hippies", the effects of throwing off the sexual mores, the rules and regulations which have been broken and which can never be patched together again properly---this is beginning to frustrate the ego of the Beast so that it is becoming more desperate, and even as it becomes more desperate, it creates a situation whereby it may totally lose control and simply peter out.
This Awareness indicates that meanwhile, the Forces of Light, the right side of the brain,--the holistic, creative, feminine aspect, the Isis side, that side which has waited for the frustration of the Beast, -- this as having undergone certain changes because of these rubbings and irritations of the Beast, and this as that which allows for a new experience, a new being which accepts the Beast for what it is, but gives no power or authority over humanity. This Awareness indicates this force of Light, of wisdom, is that which sees the Beast as a servant of humanity, not a master of humanity.
This Awareness indicates that entities in understanding how these Dark Forces and the Light Forces work together, how the rational can be a servant of the individual but the individual's holistic mind must be the master; how Christ in referring to Satan was, in effect, referring to that which is the materialistic or rationalistic mind, the dualistic mind, and stating that he "keep behind": in effect, this is the essence of the message from the past religious teachings to present social experiences.
This Awareness wishes to remind entities again, that clinging to the black serpent of materialism, with all its promises of security, clinging to the tree of knowledge, holding steadfast to the bank which is being washed away by the Sea of Consciousness, is but the fool's journey. This Awareness indicates the entity who attunes to the spirit, the eternal "now", the eternal consciousness, the realization of being, and in that being, knowing what one is; this is the true security,--security based on the Divine Being, rather than on the material body.
This Awareness indicates
that you need not deny the logic, you need not deny the left side of the brain,
you need not deny the physical body in order to accent, to accentuate, to
adore and to reside in the holistic experience, the intuitive consciousness,
the right side, the spiritual side of experience,--this Awareness indicates
you need only to remember who is master and who is servant, and keep the left
side subservient in all things.
