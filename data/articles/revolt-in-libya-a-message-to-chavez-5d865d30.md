The foray against the Venezuelan
Embassy in Tripoli at the hands of the National Transitional
Council was meant to send President Chavez a clear message.
He, too, can be overthrown by Western powers.
Hence, Caracas
is carefully examining the way in which the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya was first strangled financially, in an effort to
avoid falling prey to a similar maneuver.
The Libyan rebels August 23 attack on the
Venezuelan embassy and compound in Tripoli went largely unreported, though
fatalities were narrowly averted as Venezuelan ambassador Afif Tajeldine
and the embassy staff moved to a safer location at the last moment and left
Libya shortly thereafter.
It transpired in the wake of the incident that
Venezuelas embassy was the only one looted in the whole neighborhood,
meaning that the attack which, according to eyewitness accounts, was guided
by individuals of European appearance and military posture, specifically
targeted the countrys mission.
Venezuelan deputy foreign minister and permanent envoy to the UN Jorge
Valero Brice√±o condemned the attack in the UN Security Council. In the
meantime, Latin American commentators read the rebel hit against the
Venezuelan diplomatic mission in Tripoli as a message to Chavez
supposed to threaten him with being next blacklisted leader after the ousted
Gadhafi.
It is widely expected that the approach the
Empire put to work to destabilize Libya and Syria will in the foreseeable
future be employed in Venezuela
Reuters mentioned the plan on August 17, saying
that,
Political violence in Venezuela threatens
to undermine the outcome of next years election whether President Hugo
Chavez wins a new six-year term or not.
Outbreaks of protests in Venezuela will be
backed by
vocal media campaigns launched by,
-
BBC
-
Euronews
-
CNN
-
Fox
-
Al Jazeera, etc.,
...and will likely be paralleled by acts of
vandalism and street killings perpetrated by terrorist groups which will
sneak into Venezuela from other countries.
On the whole, what Venezuela will face is an
upgraded color revolution brand involving a stronger than ever component of
armed violence. The Pentagon, the U.S. intelligence community, the U.S.
Department of State, and the corresponding agencies of Great Britain, Spain,
Israel, Canada, and others certainly have the task of preventing the
re-election of Chavez in 2012 written into their agendas
Aware of the coming crush test, Chavez, a tough politics veteran, not only
shows full confidence ahead of the polls on the horizon but even pledges to
stake yet another re-election bid in 2018.
His program is practical in character and is
spelled out with utmost clarity. Reliance on popular support and a loyal
army should help neutralize whatever conspiracies, and the Empires
dominance will not last indefinitely. Chavezs optimism is based on the
realization that the U.S. in its current imperial shape is doomed, as by the
middle of the XXI century recurrent economic crises and domestic strife
between political factions, ethnic groups, and corporate giants will
irreversibly erode its might.
Step by step, at the cost of bloodshed and human
sufferings, the U.S. will have to shed the role of the world gendarme and
global parasite.
Foreign-policy escapades and attempts to
bulldoze defiant regimes which will continue to proliferate only bring
closer the era of the U.S. agony. Chavez is convinced that the demise of the
Empire will put the final dot in the long search of solutions for the
historically doomed imperialist system.
The Venezuelan leader speaks frequently of the escalation of socioeconomic
tensions in the U.S. and other Western countries. Though in the West the
ills tend to stay unrecognized and protests of the disadvantaged social
strata, including much of the middle class, are being suppressed, keeping
the lid on the situation is increasingly a challenge that administrations
cannot handle by traditional repressive means.
As a result, plans pop up to use countries
armed forces against their own populations, and armies are already being
trained accordingly.
The wars
on terror in which the U.S. armed forces routinely confronted
civilians deformed the mentality of the U.S. officers corps to the point
where they seem to have lost all inhibitions about such missions as wiping
out domestic conspiracies allegedly waged by Muslim extremists, populist
leaders, the reds, the anti-systemic underground, etc.
The militarization of the U.S. has reached such proportions that switching
the countrys economy to a more civilian mode promises great pains. As of
today, even minimal defense budget cuts would derail the U.S. economy as a
whole, while keeping the bloated military-industrial complex afloat takes
armed hostilities in various parts of the world.
With the U.S. constituencies wary of having to
deal with conflicts in Syria, Iran, the Caucasus or elsewhere, only a drama
comparable to
September 11 can revive the populations militancy.
Chavez believes firmly that the September 11
terrorist attack was
masterminded by the U.S. and Israeli intelligence
communities. Knowing that the elites of,
...are
working against Venezuela, he frequently revisits the theme and urges
Venezuelan TV channels to air programs warning about likely provocations
meant to undermine the Bolivarian regime.
The aggressive convulsions of the Empire, its disregard for the
international law, the swings in Washingtons decision-making and policies,
and the U.S. tendency to connect with renegade groups in the countries
defying U.S. control prompt defensive reactions across the globe and lead
nations staying outside of the U.S. orbit to reinforce their sovereignty.
The rise of regional centers of power will be
gaining momentum as a result, and even the countries under various pretexts
routed by NATO will gradually see anti-American forces prevail in domestic
politics. In the world of today, any aggression invariably meets with
resistance.
Since the failed 2002-2003 U.S. attempts to induce regime change in
Venezuela, it has been Chavezs strategy to insulate the countrys army and
economy, particularly the energy sector, from the U.S. influence.
Confrontation for its own sake cannot be
Chavezs intention considering the obvious disparity between the U.S. and
Venezuela, but the latter has to diversify its international relations and
seek viable alternatives to the status it had in the pre-Chavez epoch when
the country used to be the Empires associated state freely consenting to
exist as another Puerto Rico.
At that time, the Venezuelan upper class was
americanized to the extent of contemplating the countrys full integration
into the U.S.
Dumping oil to the global market at ridiculous
prices and enjoying the full range of comforts available to the Golden
Billion was the dream of the liberals who were dislodged by the Venezuelan
revolution to become Chavezs main foes.
These are the people slamming Chavez over every
step meant to strengthen Venezuelas independence.
For them,
-
the
nationalization of the oil sector
-
the countrys deepening engagement with
Russia and China
-
the creation of the populist
ALBA bloc
-
the
cultivation of ties with Brazil, which has grown into Latin Americas
economic powerhouse,
...are unacceptable as measures killing the oppositions
chances for a comeback.
Washington was visibly angered by Chavezs recent decision to deploy a part
of the currency holdings of Venezuela in BRICS countries, including Russia,
and to recall the Venezuelan overseas gold reserves.
Chavez said that, as the U.S. and European
economies are sinking, the time has come to tap into the potentials of such
countries as China, Russia, and Brazil and described pulling the holdings
out of the U.S. and Europe as,
"a healthy measure for Venezuela on the
eve of the capitalist crisis.
No doubt, the strategy behind the transfer of
assets from Western banks is not limited to the above regards - the de facto
confiscation of Libyas reserves known as Gadhafis gold must have also
been taken into account in Venezuela.
The Venezuelan government has reasons to believe
that under certain circumstances the countrys holdings in the West may face
a freeze, for example, under the pretext that Western companies would press
compensation claims related to nationalizations in Venezuela.
The repatriation of gold reserves should also
help Venezuela sustain economic buoyancy if the dollar and Euro suffer a
sharp depreciation.
Chavez advises other Latin American countries which keep around $570b in the
banks of the north, thus investing in its development, to follow the lead.
-
The Bank of England which since 1980 has stored 99 tons of Venezuelas gold
was the first to receive a recall request
-
The gold from U.S., Canadian,
Swiss, and French banks will similarly be transferred to Venezuela
At the moment, slightly under 58% of Venezuelas
gold reserves totaling 365 tons are stored outside of the country.
ALBA countries seem receptive to Chavezs call
for holdings repatriation. It should be noted as well that, visiting Caracas
in August, 2011, Russian diplomacy chief S. Lavrov indicated that
Moscow would readily consider Venezuelas offer to host its holdings, thus
de facto expressing support for the course Chavez was steering.
Beijings reaction was essentially the same as
Moscows.
Analysts regard Chavezs push for a Latin American financial architecture
independent from the West as a risky pursuit. Gadhafis plan to reload the
impressive currency holdings owned by Libya from Western banks to those of
China were among the reasons why he became the target of manhunt. It is
clear that the West will not forget how Chavez dispelled the myth about the
economic recovery in the U.S. and Europe.
The Venezuelan leaders radical message that the
U.S. and European economies are sinking surely resonated with those who are
able to listen.
