Isn't there something strangely
reassuring when your eyeballs are gripped by a "mystery"
on the news that has no greater meaning and yet sweeps all else
away?
This, of course, is the essence of
the ongoing tale of the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines
Flight 370. Except to the relatives of those on board, it never
really mattered what happened in the cockpit that day. To the
extent that the plane's disappearance was solvable, the mystery
could only end in one of two ways: it landed somewhere (somehow
unnoticed, a deep unlikelihood) or it crashed somewhere,
probably in an ocean. End of story.
It was, however, a tale with
thrilling upsides when it came to filling airtime, especially on
cable news.
The fact that there was no there there
allowed for the raising of every
possible disappearance trope - from Star Trekkian black
holes to the Bermuda Triangle to Muslim terrorists - and it had
the added benefit of instantly evoking a popular
TV show.
It was a formula too good to waste,
and wasted it wasn't.
The same has been true of the story
that, in the U.S., came to vie with it for the top news spot:
the devastating mudslide in Washington State.
An act of nature, sweeping out of
nowhere, buries part of a tiny community, leaving an unknown but
possibly large number of people dead.
These questions mattered locally and
to desperate relatives of those who had disappeared, but
otherwise had little import.
Yes, unbridled growth, lack
of attention to expected disasters, and even possibly climate
change were topics that might have been attached to the
mudslide horror. As a gruesome incident, it could have stood in
for a lot, but in the end it stood in for nothing except itself
and that was undoubtedly its abiding appeal.
Both stories had the added benefit
(for TV) of an endless stream of distraught relatives: teary or
weeping or stoic or angry faces in desperately tight close-ups
making heartfelt pleas for more information. For the media, it
was like the weather before climate change came along.
In response, just about anything
else that could pass for news was swept aside. Given a media
that normally rushes heedlessly from one potential 24/7 story to
another, this was striking. In the case of Flight 370, for
instance, on the 21st day after its disappearance, it still led
NBC's Nightly News with Brian Williams (with the
mudslide, one week after it happened, the number two story).
In those weeks, only one other story
broke their stranglehold on the news. It was the seemingly
critical question of what in the world was going on in Ukraine.
There was the Russian military move
into the Crimea, the referendum on that peninsula, its
annexation, the alarm of the U.S. and the European Union, the
imposition of (modest) sanctions, and various warnings of a
Russian military build-up and possible invasion of eastern
Ukraine.
Unlike the other two stories, it
seemed consequential enough. And yet in some eerie way, it, too,
came to resemble them. It was as if with the news on Ukraine we
were being sucked back into another era - that of the
superpower-run twentieth century.
The question that seemed to loom was
this: Are we in a new (i.e., the old) Cold War?
It was so front and center that it
sent opinion pollsters scrambling and they promptly discovered
that half of
all Americans thought we were - itself less a testament to
American opinion than to the overwhelming media narrative that
we were indeed living through the Cold
War redux.
Was the Soviet Union being raised
from the dead? Think of this as the Flight 370 of global
political coverage.
It had everything a story needed:
people in the square; a foreign leader who glowered just like a
movie villain should and, for once in the twenty-first century,
wasn't a U.S. president or vice president; and fears of Russian
troops entering the rest of Ukraine, with Lithuania, Estonia, or
some other
former satellite of the Soviet Union
next in line.
Where would it end? How could
Vladimir Putin's juggernaut be stopped?
As a story, it was a time warp
miracle all its own. After so many years, an American president
was denouncing not al-Qaeda, or the Taliban, or the Iraqis, or
the Iranians, but the Russians.
Once again, as in the good old bad old days, U.S. officials
could decry the
tyranny of a major state and its dangers to the globe with a
straight face.
There was finally a black-and-white
tale of international morality in which Americans could denounce
an invasion.
It had the comfy familiarity of an
old-fashioned script, one whose ending everybody already knew.
It implied that the world was once again easy to grasp, that
everything was finally back in order - the good guys and the bad
guys, East and West, freedom and tyranny.
As an old script, it had all the
fearsome charms of familiarity. While signaling danger, it
actually helped tame a world that otherwise looked unsettling
indeed.
As it happens, however, Soviet
armies will never again threaten to plunge through the
Fulda Gap.
The
Warsaw Pact is long gone, never to be revived, and Germany
will remain a united powerhouse, not a divided land.
Argue as you will about whether the
Russians or Putin are "evil," one thing is certain, there is no
"empire"
to go with it. President Obama was on the mark recently when he
referred to Putin's Russia as a "regional
power" and not a superpower at all. Not even close.
If anything, it's a country that,
thanks to NATO, the U.S., and the European Union, already had
its back to the wall, with its former "satellites" long ago
stripped away, and Ukraine looking like it was about to go, too.
(After all, an American diplomat,
talking tough, was secretly recorded seemingly
sorting out a future Ukrainian government with the local
American ambassador!)
Russia may not even quite be a
regional powerhouse. Its economy is
shaky
and, unlike the Soviet Union, it is now largely an
oil and gas state and, worse yet, its energy reserves are
expected to be in
decline in future decades.
A Planet for
the Taking
So, no, Virginia, Flight 370 was not
commandeered by aliens and Vladimir Putin is not
Joseph Stalin's younger brother.
The U.S. is not in a new Cold War,
its troops do not stand in any danger of going toe-to-toe with
Russian invaders, and a two-superpower world is dead and buried,
but so, it seems, is a
one superpower world. History is a powerful tool, but
sometimes when lost stories and old scripts dominate the
headlines, it's worth asking whether, behind the scrim of the
familiar and the empty, there might not lurk an unnerving world,
a new age that no one cares to focus on.
As with a magician, sometimes you
have to look where he isn't pointing to catch sight of reality.
With that in mind, I'd like to
nominate British journalist Patrick Cockburn for a prize. In the
midst of the recent headlines, in the
most important article no one noticed,
he pointed out something genuinely unnerving about our world.
Yes, we're all aware that the U.S.
invasion of Iraq didn't exactly work out as planned and that
Afghanistan has been a nearly 13-year disaster, even though the
U.S. faced the most ragtag of minority insurgencies in both
places.
What, however, about the monumental
struggle that used to be called the Global War on Terror?
After all, we
got Osama bin Laden. It took a while, but SEAL Team 6 shot
him down in his hideout in Pakistan. And for years, thanks to
the CIA's drone assassination campaigns in the Pakistani tribal
borderlands, Yemen, and Somalia (as well as a full scale
hunter-killer operation in Iraq while we were still
occupying that country), we've been told that endless
key al-Qaeda "lieutenants"
have been sent to their deaths and that al-Qaeda in Afghanistan
has been reduced to
50-100 members.
Yet Cockburn concludes:
"Twelve years after the war on
terror' was launched it has visibly failed and al-Qaeda-type
jihadis, once confined to a few camps in Afghanistan, today
rule whole provinces in the heart of the Middle East."
Look across that region today and
from Pakistan to Libya, you see the rise, not the fall, of
jihadis of every type.
In Syria and parts of Iraq, groups
that have associated themselves with al-Qaeda now have a
controlling military presence in territories the size of, as
Cockburn points out, Great Britain.
He calls al-Qaeda's recent rise as
the jihadi brand name of choice and the failure of the U.S.
campaign against it,
"perhaps the most extraordinary
development of the 21st century."
And that, unlike the claims we've
been hearing at the top of the news for weeks now, might not be
an exaggeration.
Looked at another way, despite what
had just happened to the Pentagon and those towers in New York,
on September 12, 2001, the globe's "sole superpower" had
remarkably few enemies. Small numbers of
jihadis scattered mostly in
the backlands of the planet and centered in an impoverished,
decimated country - Afghanistan - with the most retro regime on
Earth.
There were, in addition, three
rickety "rogue states" (North Korea, Iraq, and Iran) singled out
for enemy status but incapable of harming the U.S., and that was
that.
The world, as
Dick Cheney & Co.
took for granted, looked ready to be dominated by the only
(angry) hyperpower left after centuries of imperial rivalry. The
U.S. military, its technological capability unrivaled by any
state or possible grouping of states, was to be
let loose to bring the Greater Middle East to heel in a
decisive way.
Between that regular military and
para-militarizing intelligence agencies, the planet was to be
scoured of enemies, the "swamp
drained" in up to
60 countries. The result would be a
Pax Americana in the Middle
East, and perhaps even globally, into the distant future. It was
to be legendary.
And no method - not torture, abuse,
kidnapping, the creation of "black sites," detention without
charges, assassination, the creation of secret law, or
surveillance on a previously unimaginable scale - was to be left
out of the toolkit used to birth this new all-American planet.
The "gloves"
were to be taken off in a big way.
Thirteen years later, those plans,
those dreams are down the drain. The Greater Middle East is in
chaos. The U.S. seems incapable of intervening in a meaningful
way just about anywhere on Earth despite the fact that its
military remains unchallenged on a global level. It's little
short of mind-blowing.
And it couldn't have been more
unexpected for those in power in Washington and perhaps for
Americans generally.
This is perhaps why, despite
changing American attitudes on
interventions and future
involvement abroad, it's been so hard to take in, so little
focused upon here - even in the bogus, politicized
discussions of American "strength" and "weakness"
which circle around the latest Russian events, as they had
previously around the crises in Iran and Syria.
Somehow, with what in any age would
have seemed like a classic winning hand, Washington never put a
card on that "table"
(on which all "options"
were always being kept
open) that wasn't trumped. Events in Ukraine and the Crimea
seem to be part of this.
The Chinese had an evocative phrase
for times of dynastic collapse: "chaos under heaven."
Moments when it seems as if the
planet itself is shifting on its axis don't come often, but they
may indeed feel like chaos under heaven - an increasingly apt
phrase for a world in which no country seems to exert much
control, tensions are rising in hard to identify ways, and the
very climate, the very habitability of the planet is
increasingly
at risk.
When The
Losers Are The Winners
Even in a losing game, there are
usually winners.
One of the conundrums of this
particular moment, however, is that the winners in our American
world are exactly those who have repeatedly been playing the
losing hands.
Their reward for one self-defined
disaster after another has been yet more money, yet wider areas
of everyday life to control, and yet
more power. No matter how inept they may prove as imperial
players on a world stage, they can essentially do no wrong
domestically when it comes to embedding themselves ever more
deeply in our lives in the name of our "security" and our
"safety." It's a remarkable tale. Legendary, one might almost
say.
As the power of American power to
accomplish seemingly anything fades, the power of the national
security state only grows.
It's true that, in the wake of the
Edward Snowden revelations, the managers of our secret state
have had to pull back in a few areas - especially the gathering
and holding of phone metadata for the complete U.S. population.
But the significance of this is easy
to exaggerate.
It's worth remembering that in the
wake of the Watergate era, the last time we went through a round
of "reforms" of an out-of-control secret world, the national
security state somehow ended up with its own secret court system
and
secret body of law to which all citizens became accountable
even though they could know nothing about it. Four decades
later, in a situation in which that secret state is so much
stronger, such reforms may once again turn out only to
enhance its power.
It's true as well that the CIA has
had to pull back on some of the methods it used to such
disastrous effect after 9/11, in particular closing those "black
sites" it set up (though some may still exist, possibly
in Somalia and perhaps on
U.S. naval ships) and on the use of torture.
Nonetheless, the recent spectacle of
the Agency's attack on Senator Dianne Feinstein and the
staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee over a still-secret
6,300 page critical report on its Bush-era torture and black
site programs should be instructive.
After all, Feinstein has made her
reputation, in part, as the senator from the national security
state. She has typically
supported the NSA's secret programs as well as those of
other intelligence outfits, straight down the line.
There has perhaps been no one more
sympathetic among Democratic representatives in Congress.
On a single issue, a single set of
programs by a single agency, however, she chose to differ and
offer genuine criticism. You might think that, under the
circumstances, she would still be handled by the secret state
with kid gloves.
Instead, the CIA
referred her committee staff to the Justice Department for
possible crimes, while she was
attacked as if she were the Great Satan and finally driven
to the Senate floor to
denounce the CIA for potential criminal acts and infringing
the Constitution.
Even the president didn't come to her aid.
Think of this as a reasonable
yardstick for measuring the real power relations between
Washington's official overseers and those who are supposed to be
overseen.
Think of the overseen as now
negotiating from a position of significant strength the details
of their future benefits package. And we can count on one thing:
whatever changes are made, they will be largely cosmetic.
The many parts of America's
growing shadow government - secret law, secret surveillance,
secret power, and the secret state - are here to stay.
From the 9/11 attacks on, that
secret state and the militarized world of Washington that goes
with it have shown themselves, even by their own standards,
woefully incapable of handling a new and puzzling world.
Their actions have repeatedly
undermined the usual sort of imperial control, instead
facilitating
spreading chaos.
Post-9/11, they have had a
remarkable knack for creating not just blowback - the CIA term
of tradecraft that scholar Chalmers Johnson
put into our vocabulary - but something for which we have no
word. Think of it perhaps as just the "blow" part of that term.
The orderliness of secret power in
Washington and chaos under heaven, the growth of a police state
and a planet run riot, turn out to be two sides of the same
coin.
If you want a news story that will
glue eyes, then think of it this way:
on September 12, 2001, the
national security state entered the cockpit of (to modernize
a phrase) the plane of state, hijacked it, and steered it
directly for the Bermuda Triangle - and here was the
strangest thing of all: no one even noticed.
