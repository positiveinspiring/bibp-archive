With some of the discussion going on it is
important to understand the situation before jumping in. You are on this
site so you must have some clues that all is not what it seams.
I and others have spent a while researching
this, so lets enlighten the situation.
If
WikiLeaks has taught us anything, it is that the government
lies. While the
mainstream media will generally not show
these lies, thanks to the Internet they are there if you look.
So what are these lies?
-
The
Federal Reserve has been a bad boy
and recently created 9 trillion dollars without congress approval
and passed it off to the international banking community, as well as
assisting insider trading and other deceitful actions.
-
While the appearance the the
global financial collapse is over
and history, it is not. There have been some regulatory improvements
since but many of the underlying problems are still there. The
bailouts approved by congress have helped keep the creditors at bay,
for a little while.
-
The derivatives market is currently
valued in the quadrillions of dollars (more money than what is in
the rest of the world), while having no real assets. Basically it is
just a big casino, some also describe it as a pyramid scheme in the
way it is managed.
-
The national debt is so high that just
servicing the debts interest is becoming untenable. With congress
blocking the next round of bailouts there is no money for January's
debt obligation. When a country goes bankrupt this
means revolution. If you do make it past January then you have a lot
to thank China for as wall street and other bankers continue to rip
off. The military and other spending has also contributed.
So with very limited over site and significant
conflict of interests in how the economy is managed, it is stuffed and only
really held together by a pack of lies at the moment.
Have you heard of the WikiLeaks insurance file,
the Bank of America it tipped to fall. What would happen if we had
transparent access to all of the banks records? As for how and why, the
answers are around but it has been a long and conceded effort with some
incompetence thrown in.
Ok, economy falls, change the government, make a new currency all good? Not
yet. 9/11 is a thorn that just will not go away. I cannot say it better then
in the presentation '9/11
Blueprint for Truth'. If you are here you must heard about 'truthers',
if not you will soon enough.
The name 'truther' says it all. A movement that
is growing bigger and stronger, tired of the deceit, diversions and lack of
transparency. They want answers, not lies and will not stop until they get
them. While Osama Bin Laden was the first suspect, they have drafted up a
more realistic suspect list.
Ok, end the war, get ride of some bad apples, all good now? Nope. Industry
has not had it's turn yet.
The big one is oil, but there are many others
with the profits over lives and the environment attitude. Remember cold
fusion? it works. Heard of people driving their cars on water? some do. Zero
point energy? that too. The only reason we hang onto oil is for the military
and the banks, the real terrorists.
The people, economy and the environment is much
better off with out it.
Ok, no more gas stations, are we done yet? We have not even started on the
big stuff.
Life, more importantly our real place in the
universe.
UFO's... I don't want to spoil the big
surprise for you, but if you have been astute you know something is going
on. How much swamp gas and other pathetic debunks does it take to realize
the media lies. Millions of sightings world wide over the years, some on
camera, video, radar and close up 'n personal. We have all had to make our
own judgments on this one, but the evidence is there if you look.
Ok, so we make some new friends and/or enemies are we done?
We are when you learn about the relationships
and links between all these problems as there is some overlap. You cannot
take one unless you take them all. Conversely, bring down on one and they
will all fall. This is what I see when I remove the lies from our perception
in the search for reality.
How much different would life be if it was not
for a few powerful people who decided to suck the life out of this planet
instead of contributing to it as much as everybody else does? This why
people are angry when things are made so much harder than what they really
need to be, when they learn just how deep the lies go.
WikiLeaks presented an amazing window of
opportunity between two different worlds, one in which we remain mushrooms
on a dying world, another where we face a reality with more potential and
opportunity than what we thought was possible. All we have to do is
confront the reality.
The next question is how? The floor is
open for discussion.
