Shimon Peres
Today the President of Israel, Shimon Peres,
said that a military strike against Iran is growing increasingly likely by
the day.
This comes just days before the report on Irans nuclear program is going to
be released by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a
United
Nations body.
Peres has been quite clear that the push for an attack on Iran is gaining
steam saying that an attack on Iran was becoming more and more likely in
an interview on Israels Channel Two on Saturday.
Peres made this even clearer in a statement to Israels Hayom, in which
he
said,
The possibility of a military attack
against Iran is now closer to being applied than the application of a
diplomatic option.
To make matters even worse for the world,
Haaretz reported today that Israel is refusing to clear a military strike
with the United States before it occurs.
Panetta was reportedly seeking to coordinate
U.S. efforts with Israeli efforts in combating the perceived threat of
Iranian nuclear ambitions but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak refused to provide a clear response,
instead answering vaguely and in general terms.
Haaretz reports that American military officials had previously been
confident that the U.S. would receive advance warning of an Israeli attack
on Iran but now they are not so sure.
The IAEA report is supposedly going to reveal that Iran has indeed pursued
the development of nuclear weapons including,
experiments in the final stage for
developing nuclear weapons including explosions and computer simulations
of explosions, according to Israeli news outlet
Haaretz.
Leaks coming from anonymous sources in Vienna
where the IAEA is headquartered claim that Iran has already carried out
experiments in the critical stage of weaponization at the Parchin military
base around 30 km outside of Tehran.
According to the leaks, the report will include documents and satellite
photos that support the accusation that Iran is pursuing the development of
nuclear weapons in violation of international agreements.
However, this type of satellite imagery intelligence is
quite unreliable and
easily falsifiable as we saw in the push to invade Iraq.
The claim of satellite photos of the site [which] reveal a bus-sized
container for conducting experiments sounds eerily like the claims (which
later turned out to be outright lies) made to justify the invasion of Iraq.
Haaretz reports that The Associated Press and other media outlets have
reported on these alleged bus-sized containers although how they know a
bus-sized container is a facility for conducting nuclear experiences is
anyones guess.
The report is also supposedly going to reveal that Iran has started the
installation of centrifuges in an underground nuclear facility near Qom.
This type of underground nuclear facility would give Iran a
second strike
capability because they are designed to absorb an aerial attack while still
being able to fire back afterwards.
This is designed as a deterrence mechanism because countries without a
second strike capability are at risk of being wiped out in one massive first
strike without any means to retaliate.
The second strike capability makes a nuclear attack much less likely because
it provides the attacker with the guarantee that they will be retaliated
against if they decide to attack.
Of course this would require that Iran has nuclear weapons to begin with, an
underground nuclear power plant unto itself is not dangerous and it would
not represent a second strike capability.
I do not think it is either unlikely or wholly objectionable for Iran to
develop a nuclear defense strategy against the looming threat of U.S.-U.K.-Israeli
aggression, although the proof showing that Iran has indeed pursued a
weapons program just isnt there.
A second strike facility is not designed for an act of nuclear aggression
and the facility near Qom is subject to IAEA inspections so it is unlikely
that such a facility would be used as such.
Yet this information, if true, will surely be spun to give the impression
that the facility is a threat to the world instead of a defensive measure.
Regardless, anonymous diplomats cited by Haaretz say that the governing
board of the IAEA will likely not condemn Iran at the November 17th-18th
meeting.
They say that it would likely take months to push China and Russia into
supporting a resolution which could lead toward additional UN sanctions
against Iran.
Both China and Russia have been very reluctant to support broadened
sanctions against both Iran and
Syria, given that historically speaking it
would likely be the first step on the road towards Western military
intervention.
Israeli Defense Minister Barak has denied the reports circulating that
Israels Prime Minister Netanyahu had already come to the decision that they
would attack Iran.
I hope Barak is being honest and forthcoming, but my hope would be misguided
if I did not temper it with reality.
In the following interview you can see Barak emphasize that no option
should be off the table when dealing with the perceived Iranian threat:
Meanwhile, in Iran, the Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, said that the
IAEAs report was politicized and that the report would be baseless.
I believe that these documents lack authenticity. But if they insist, they
should go ahead and publish. Better to face danger once than be always in
danger, Salehi said.
We have said repeatedly that their documents are baseless. For example one
can counterfeit money, but it remains counterfeit. These documents are like
that, he added.
I truly hope that all of this posturing coming from Israel is just that but
I think many people around the world agree that an assault on Iran by
Israel, the U.S. and/or the U.K. would be devastating for us all.
As I have previously shown, Iran isnt shying away from rattling their
sabers either (evidenced by their threat to
deploy ships of the U.S. East
Coast), so we must hope that one side of this conflict doesnt escalate, or
else we can expect the other side to respond in kind.
