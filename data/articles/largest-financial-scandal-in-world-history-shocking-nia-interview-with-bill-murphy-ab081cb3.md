NIA just released a shocking interview with Bill
Murphy of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee (GATA).
This is one of the most important interviews that you will ever listen to in
your entire life.
Bill Murphy is the world's top expert on the manipulation and price
suppression scheme that has been taking place in the gold/silver markets.
Please share this interview with everybody you know. This could possibly be
the largest financial scandal in world history.
It is important to spread the word about NIA to as many people as possible,
as quickly as possible, if you want America to survive hyperinflation.
