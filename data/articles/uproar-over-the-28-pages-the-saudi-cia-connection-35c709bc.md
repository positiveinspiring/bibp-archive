# Uproar Over the '28 Pages' - The Saudi/CIA Connection?

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_911_208.htm

Kean and Hamilton wrote,
"The 28
pages have generated a lot of public speculation over the years
and have been described as a 'smoking gun' implicating the Saudi
government in
the deadliest terrorist attack carried out on U.S.
soil."
They go on to write,
"What often
gets lost in those theories is that the 28 pages were based
almost entirely on raw, unvetted material that came to the FBI.
That material was written up as possible leads for further
investigation, and the 28 pages were a summary of some of those
reports and leads as of the end of 2002 - all of them
uninvestigated."
What Tom and Lee fail to acknowledge
is the reason the "raw, unvetted material" was left
"uninvestigated" was strictly because of the 9/11 Commission's
Staff Director, Philip Zelikow.
Zelikow has
too many conflicts of interest
to list in this blog.
Suffice it to say that a critical portion
of the
9/11 Commission's Final Report
can be seen as merely a fairy-tale rendition (or intelligence
"story") of Philip's design. (Scroll down to the lunch break,
read Zelikow's next Staff Statement where he talks about an
"intelligence story.")
Indeed,
chapter 5, "Al Qaeda Aims at
the Homeland," and chapter 7, "The Attack Looms," provide most
of the vital pieces of information surrounding the 9/11 plot by
citing Khalid Sheikh Mohammad's interviews as their primary
source.
Why would any laudable historian
(who Zelikow professes to be) base an official accounting of the
worst terrorist attack since Pearl Harbor on the bogus ramblings
of a detained, tortured terrorist?
That's why anything and
everything that comes out of Zelikow's mouth should be
questioned for its veracity - and motive.
After all, if the person in charge
of torturing KSM wanted to obscure the Saudi role, is it a
surprise that KSM would say what his torturer wanted to hear?
Moreover, is it a surprise that the
person or persons in charge of KSM's torture, who wanted to
obscure the U.S. government's awareness of the threat and indeed
specific knowledge of many of the terrorist activities before
the attack, would elicit a story consistent with that goal?
Indeed, regarding the 9/11
Commission's treatment of the Saudi role in the 9/11 attacks,
Zelikow's hands are easily found.
Look at three items.
-
First, Zelikow blocked and
then fired Dana Lesemann when she tried to
investigate the uninvestigated leads in the 28 pages.
Where were Tom and Lee when this happened?
-
Second, it was only Zelikow
and Dieter Snell who were granted access and able
to question Omar Bayoumi - a man who stands at the
epicenter of the Saudi nexus to the 9/11 attacks. Why
were Zelikow and Snell the only ones permitted to
interview such a key individual?
-
Finally, it was Zelikow and
Snell who "re-wrote" the entire Saudi section of the
9/11 Commission's Final Report - leaving out all the
damning, incriminating information. Where is that
missing information today? Available for public review?
So please, when Tom and Lee say that
they "found no evidence linking the Saudi's to the 9/11
attacks," pay careful attention to the cute use of their words,
"found no evidence."
Because while concededly there may
not then have been conclusive proof,
there were certainly indications and evidence that required
further and immediate follow-up.
In addition, note when Tom and Lee
talk about access granted to the 28 pages being given to
"relevant" staff.
-
Which staff were deemed
relevant?
-
And who decided what
staffers were "relevant?"
-
Zelikow?
-
Everyone had clearance, so
why didn't all investigative staff have access to the 28
pages?
Tom and Lee also proudly state that
their report is unclassified and available to the public.
What you need to realize is that
while their final report is unclassified, the source documents
for that report remain classified and hidden from the public.
In short, unlike redacted reports
where you can readily see what is being kept secret by the dark
lines crossing out words, with the 9/11 Commission's Final
Report, we'll never know how much other pertinent information
was kept out and classified by Zelikow.
And, as someone who has looked for
specific documents on the National Archives website, I can state
emphatically that many of the 9/11 Commission's
most vital and damning documents
remain redacted, withheld, classified and/or unavailable to the
public.
Moreover, please pay attention to
how Tom and Lee characterize the 9/11 Review Panel.
Realize that the 9/11 Review Panel
did nothing more than tie up the loose, uncomfortable (i.e.
damning) ends that would inevitably be created with the
release
of the 28 pages.
Was the Panel's purpose to uncover
the entire 9/11 story or to stop further inquiry that would
eventually uncover the entire truth?
Finally, I do agree with one section
of Kean and Hamilton's editorial,
"The 9/11 attacks were the worst
mass murder ever carried out in the United States. Those
responsible deserve the maximum punishment possible.
Therefore, accusations of complicity in that mass murder
from responsible authorities are a grave matter. Such
charges should be levied with care."
I just hope that both Kean and
Hamilton mean what they say when they talk about those
responsible and complicit in the 9/11 attacks "deserving the
maximum punishment possible."
And I hope their definition of
complicity is as broad as mine, by including actions before and
after the crime and actors from inside and outside the United
States.
So for example, let's just say that
our CIA (or a rogue element of it) tried to recruit two 9/11
hijackers in San Diego who were already in contact with Saudi
agents.
And in carrying out that task,
the
CIA worked with those Saudi agents in the recruitment process.
And thus, all the Saudi contacts and support for the hijackers
detailed in the 28 pages (the so-called "smoking gun")
necessarily reveals the CIA/Saudi cooperation in dealing with
those two 9/11 hijackers.
Incidentally, this might explain why
CIA Director, John Brennan, has
joined the chorus in stating
that all information released in the 28 pages is
"uncorroborated, unvetted information."
-
Will Kean and Hamilton
support holding the
CIA officials accountable?
-
Will Cofer Black and James
Pavitt be held accountable?
-
George Tenet?
-
John McLaughlin?
-
What about John Brennan?
-
Or Michael Hayden?
-
Bob Mueller?
-
Richard Clarke?
-
Too late for Sandy Berger
(and those docs he stuffed in his socks), but what about
Clinton?
-
Bush?
-
Cheney?
-
Rice?
-
And,
Obama?
-
How about Zelikow and all
others who have known the truth for years and kept
silent?
When Kean and Hamilton say
complicity is a "grave matter," I hope they follow through on
their word.
Clearly, much will depend on how
good a job was done by the 9/11 Review Panel. But, putting that
aside, I certainly hope the U.S. government does not expect the
9/11 families to ignore fifteen years of their cover-up and
capitalized "opportunities" in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.
(Quoting
Condi Rice here
in the immediate wake of the 9/11 attacks where she said, "how
can we capitalize on these opportunities" - that's right, she
called the mass murder of 3000 innocent people an "opportunity"
that should be "capitalized upon").
Recently, we've seen that even
though decades have passed since Dennis Hastert committed his
despicable deeds, he was eventually caught and held accountable
for the cover-up of those deeds.
To me, this demonstrates that
the truth will always emerge. Fifteen years after the 9/11
murders, we have uncovered a part of that truth, let us hope it
does not take another fifteen years for the whole truth to
emerge.
Rest assured, we will never give up nor will we ever go
away...
