A plot to cause Bank of America to fail has been
hatched involving WikiLeaks and its CEO, alleged "activist," suspected CIA
operative, Julian Assange.
This article presents related evidence and commentary in advance of a
threatened run on Bank of America by depositors frightened by what appears
to be an organized conspiracy to crash the US economy.
Many years ago, the wizards behind Wall Street invested in the emerging
New
World Order, and set you up, along with the economy and everyone else, to go
down.
The
Rockefellers,
Bushes, and
Rothschild League of Bankers, manipulated
governments, economies,
BigPharma, the energy industries, terrorist groups,
weapons makers, and
media manipulators.
Their successes hinged on
controlling every side of every major debate, political faction, and
economic opportunity. Their ultimate success depends on controlling you too.
To institute their New World Order reforms they need your help. To enlist
you in their fraud, they perfected frightening propaganda for marketing
socio-economic deceptions, mass mind control, and building vast new
industries, such as "Transportation Safety" following 9/11.
We The People, with money in banks, are now being pushed to consider the
security or our investments.
There are rumors of banks closing soon,
including Bank of America (BoA), the largest in our nation. If, or when, BoA
fails, the "domino effect" assures a New Deal globally for the Rockefeller/Rothschild-directed
banking industry.
Recalling History Now
Repeating
Before you attack the nearest ATM, consider this economic fright is
reminiscent of the 2009 Swine Flu fraud and marketing campaign.
Frightened by the intense propaganda, people
waited in long lines for hours to get the deadly jab, believing it would
keep them safe.
The "pandemic" fizzled and its devil-doers retreated once
the light of truth was spread by word-of-mouth, and people like you, using
the Internet.
The New World Order agenda is set to bring everyone to plead for
geopolitical and economic reforms administered by the next "trustworthy"
reformer promoted by the networks.
When the entire economic system collapses, as it did during the Great
Depression in 1929, Congress will undoubtedly put Rockefeller/Rothschild
underlings, like Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, on the witness stand to
spew more rhetoric justifying their existence and New World Order economics.
Looking back at the Great Depression, the
globalists needed to create a series of unprecedented financial disasters,
beginning with the stock market crash and subsequent runs on banks.
Today, the "Big Crash" has happened, many banks have closed, and the final
step, a global
bank run, is scheduled for Tuesday,
December 7th, 2010, according to news sources.
The threatening
bank run campaign seems to have originated
in France (see English website translation
here).
Americans supposedly joined forces
with the French (a rare occurrence neglecting traditionally strained
relations), as you can see on
MoveYourMoney.org and
UseCashMovement.org.
The story starts with ex-Manchester
football player, Eric Cantona, who allegedly came up with the idea that the
way to strike back at "The System," was for everyone to remove their money
from big banks on December 7th.
The question is what are the future consequences of doing that?
For the answer, recall 1929.
The problems rest with the globalists' license to consolidate, annihilate
competition, and print as much money as they need to advance their New World
Order. At the end of every Monopoly Game there is only one winner that owns
everything.
So far the Rockefeller/Rothschild League has done a great job manufacturing
and leveraging the worlds' disasters.
In a
July, 2010, article written by these
authors, you can see how the Central Bankers made vast fortunes on Hitler's
birthday from their
Gulf Oil Disaster, through their entities BP,
Halliburton, and Transocean.
Shorting Transocean stocks 24-hours ahead of the explosion evidences
foreknowledge and an organized conspiracy to commit environmental
catastrophe, indicting these parties, and proving they are capable of
committing unfathomable damage.
A Different View of The WikiLeaks
Case
Is It
Credible?
WikiLeaks is referred to as a "whistleblower site." It is best known for its
release of
Iraqi War documents including the names of
confidential informants who worked with American and Iraqi security forces.
The site might serve, however, as a perfect platform for a CIA/MI6
counterintelligence program (i.e.,
COINTELPRO). Suspiciously, the operation,
in this latest breaking news, appears to advance the NWO agenda.
WikiLeaks works perfectly for the NWO agenda
because it allows the right amount of information and disinformation to
slowly disseminate, manipulate, and confuse the minds of the masses.
After
reading Wikileaks, stories about corruption in the financial sector of
government as shown in these
WikiLeak data logs, readers clamor for the
some alternative to federal corruption. This feeds the New World Order
agenda.
Thus, WikiLeaks appears to share more than its Wiki-branding with Wikipedia.
In recent months
Wikipedia has been similarly exposed for
'corrupting' our minds on behalf of agent provocateurs working for the CIA and
the Illuminati.
Julian Assange - Is He
and Forbes Credible?
The latest news coming from WikiLeaks involves its CEO,
Julian Assange,
and Forbes magazine that lends Assange credibility. He states in his
interview with Forbes that WikiLeaks will
soon release tens of thousands of documents from a major U.S. financial firm
in early 2011.
Assange wouldn't say exactly what date, what bank, or what
documents, but he compared the coming release to the emails that emerged in
the Enron trial, that provided a comprehensive look at a corporation's
crimes.
"It will give a true and representative
insight into how banks behave at the executive level in a way that will
stimulate investigations and reforms, I presume," he told Forbes.
Forbes,
you may recall from previous Horowitz
and Kane articles, employed
David Rockefeller's ally,
Benjamin Fulford.
This Canadian propagandist, working in Japan,
forged the last writing of Rockefeller nemesis,
Christopher Story (a.k.a.,
Edward Harle). Fulford threatened journalist Story's death according to
Story, the world's leading financial industry whistleblower. Story was
murdered last July.
Then Fulford, collaborating with CIA agent-provocateur,
Greg Szmansky (a.k.a., Eric Samuelson), attached a forged "Knights of Malta"
list to Story's last article, libeling Dr. Horowitz in the process, and
implicating him in Story's murder.
In the Forbes interview, Assange was asked,
"So do you have very high impact
corporate stuff to release then?"
Assange replied,
"Yes, but maybe not as
high impact, I mean, it could take down a bank or two."
There is talk that Bank of America, whose stock dropped more than 3% last
week, may be one of the financial institutions that WikiLeaks is
referencing, because in an October, 2009,
interview with Computer World, Assange
said,
"At the moment, for example, we are sitting on five gigabytes from
Bank of America, one of the executive's hard drives," he said.
"Now how do
we present that? It's a difficult problem. We could just dump it all into
one giant Zip file, but we know for a fact that has limited impact. To have
impact, it needs to be easy for people to dive in and search it and get
something out of it."
Assange the Fugitive
or Instrument of the Hegelian Dialectic?
Assange, we are told, is currently a fugitive, wanted by Interpol, allegedly
for two sex crimes against women. In one case, he was reluctant to wear a
condom during consensual sex.
The "fugitive" label now given to Assange works
best for the Hegelian dialectic - the main method of
mind-manipulation - challenging newsmakers' and whistleblowers' credibility, generating mass confusion.
This Hegelian, "mix-it-all-up," strategy evidences a CIA-COINTELPRO double
agency: Assange, supposedly working for the good guys, appears discredited,
yet assigned to operate as controlled opposition, a news maker that takes
the heat of condemnation, a general distraction, only to be cleared later of
wrongdoing in weakly evidenced cases.
Assange describes himself as an "information activist."
He says,
"The
fundamental human struggle is between individuals and powerful
institutions."
Increasingly, legitimate activists think Assange is "controlled
opposition" - a shill for the "powerful institutions" he indicts. The bad
guys have names that Assange neglects to mention.
Surely the gravity of America's economic collapse is sufficient to warrant
Forbes's and Assange's full disclosure. Failure to do so is treasonous and
genocidal given millions of lives are risked by their censorship and
conducting their "business a usual."
Many people now see Assange as a "wolf in sheep's clothing."
Thierry Meyssan,
who made himself an enemy of the U.S. by declaring in his book that 9/11 was
orchestrated by George Bush, is one of many activists that may have once
supported Assange.
His mind, along with many others, changed when Assange
disparaged the 9/11 Truth Movement.
Assange reported,
"I am constantly annoyed that
people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we
provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud."
Real conspiracies for war? What the heck was
9/11?
Follow the money from the Partnership for
New York City's profits and losses from 9/11 to Las Vegas' latest
attraction called the "City Center." There's your "smoking gun."
The equity
investors' in "City Center" feature the 9/11 Memorial - two leaning Veer
Towers - sufficient to indict Assange, Larry Silverstein, David Rockefeller,
Rupert Murdoch, and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, for treason and mass
murder.
Let's pin the tale on the right donkey. Meyssan has denounced Assange as
being part of the American government "political diversion."
But the first "diversion" is thinking the
American government, not the Rockefeller and Rothschild League of Bankers,
is the root cause of chaos benefiting the NWO.
Assange, Ellsberg and
Rand Corporation Propaganda
Now here's a shocker - history is repeating from the pre-WikiLeaks era...
Assange is being promoted, and endorsed, by
Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked
The
Pentagon Papers that, like Assange's leaks, neglected Rockefeller family and
CIA involvements in the profitable Vietnam War.
Ellsberg was employed by the
Rand Corporation, a
major propaganda contractor for the military investment community,
especially the Illuminati.
Today, Ellsberg and Assange are heavily involved in public persuasion and
distraction, strongly suggesting Rand Corporation's involvements in
engineering this publicity campaign that could bring down the banks.
In 1971, Ellsberg generated worldwide attention by releasing copies of the
7000-page top-secret Pentagon document on the Vietnam War.
He is a master in
economics and developed the "decision
theory," now known as the "Ellsberg Paradox," related to "game
theory," used in war making decisions. With his intelligence
background, and globalist connections, there is little doubt Ellsberg and
Assange are hiding more than they're telling about their bosses' NWO plans.
Assange's squealing in the media, in harmony with Ellsberg, foreshadowing
social unrest, martial law, and foreign and domestic military operations, is
obviously self-incriminating in lieu of Ellsberg's connections and
endorsements of Assange.
In counterintelligence operations, two agents
are better than one, especially when mutual admiration among
"controlled-opposition leaders" leads to mass persuasion and deadly
profitable distractions.
Researchers will find the above links to
Wikipedia's propaganda neglects
Michael Aquino's mention.
The director
of the "Church of Set," the new "Church of Satan," has
directed the Pentagon's propaganda programs
since the Vietnam War ended.
Assange has made Ellsberg, Aquino, and the
Illuminati, proud.
In an Oct. 23, 2010,
interview with the New York Times, Ellsberg
said of Assange,
"I've been waiting 40 years for someone to disclose
information on a scale that might really make a difference."
What if that difference infects, injects, sickens, and starves 300 million
Americans, and billions more worldwide?
