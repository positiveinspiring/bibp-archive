Apart from documents that have outlined supposed terrorist threats, like Al-Qaeda, and their connection to U.S. intelligence agencies, like the CIA, there are a number of whistleblowers that have come out adding more fuel to the fire.
Because not many are even aware of these documents, letting people know about a truth that can be hard for people to accept, let alone ponder the possibility is very important. It's just one aspect of the veil that's been blinding the masses for quite some time now. The latest whistleblower is David Steele, a 20-year Marine Corps Intelligence officer, and the second-highest-ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence.
He is a former CIA clandestine services case officer, and this is what he had to say:
"Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We've become a lunatic asylum."

What Is a "False Flag Attack?" A great example of a false flag attack is 9/11, something that many people believe to be a creation of U.S. intelligence agencies, or some entity above the government (one that controls what Eisenhower called "the military industrial complex").
The idea is that these so called terrorist attacks are created by this group, in order to justify the infiltration of other countries, and to justify a heightened state of "national security."
As a result, in the eyes of the citizenry, war and mass murder are justified, when the intentions behind these actions are something the citizenry has no idea about.
This is why we see a false sense of patriotism programmed into many people, especially in the United States. Men and women join this massive military machine with good hearts, thinking that they are serving their country and fighting terrorism, when they are doing the complete opposite.
They are only participating in a fabricated war based on lies and misinformation.
"The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the 'devil' only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States." Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook

Today, we might be seeing the same thing with ISIS.
Although there are no verified documents like there are when it comes to Al-Qaeda, given what that information shows us, combined with Wikileaks documents and statements from insiders, we could be looking at the same thing. Not long ago, FBI whistleblower stated that:
"The U.S. is reviving terror scare with ISIS to promote the terror war industry."
You can read below, more about that story. Again, 9/11 is a great example and you can find out more information about that here.
"U.S. is Reviving Terror Scare with ISIS to...
Promote the Terror War Industry"

So called "terrorist" attacks have been taking place on the planet for decades, the most memorable one being 9/11.
Almost 15 years later, that one "terrorist" attack has served as a massive awakening tool for the human race, allowing us to see through the veil that's been blinding the masses for so long, but we still have a long way to go.
Interestingly, it's a well documented fact that Al-Qaeda was a creation of the CIA, there are multiple sources that show that, and it seems that ISIS might not be any different. (source) (source)
The same terrorist groups the United States and their allies are fighting against were created by the United States and their allies themselves, this is a historical fact, so it's important we ask the same questions when it comes to ISIS and keep our minds open to that possibility.
Many believe these groups are created to give the false illusion that we are under attack, in order to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives, and many still believe we are going after "terrorists."
Below is a video of US four star General Wesley Clark pretty much alluding to the same thing:
The video farther below, is of FBI whistle blower Sibel Edmonds appearing on RT news.
She is a former FBI translator and founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition (NSWBC). She gained a lot of attention in 2002 after she accused a colleague of covering up illicit activity involving Turkish nationals, which included serious security breaches and cover-ups, alluding to intelligence that was deliberately suppressed.
Here's what she had to say about the "terrorist" group ISIS. She basically points to the belief that ISIS is the creation of those who are calling them terrorists.
Think about that for a moment.
