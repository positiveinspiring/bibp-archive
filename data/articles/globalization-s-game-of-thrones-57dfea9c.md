Part 1
- Dynastic Power in the Modern World
-
7 May 2014
Think of any period in human history when
empires and imperialism were common features of society, whether from
ancient Egypt, Rome, China, to the Ottomans and the rise of the European and
Japanese empires.
There is an institution that - with few exceptions - was
prevalent across most imperial societies: the family dynasty.
In a world dominated by institutions - organized hierarchically and embedded
with their own functions and ideologies - the 'family unit' is very often
the first and most important institution in the development of individuals.
For the rich and powerful, the family unit has been the principal
institution through which power is accumulated, preserved and propagated,
precisely because the interest is multi-generational, requiring long-term
planning and strategy.
In powerful states and empires, families have been essential in the process
of constructing and governing the major institutions within those societies,
as well as in the direct control of the imperial or state structure itself.
Whether emperors, kings, queens or sultans, family dynasties have very often
exerted direct political control of society.
This has been the case for much
of human history, at least so long as empires and states have been
consistent features.
And yet, in the modern era, we imagine our societies to
be free of dynastic rule - an archaic feature of a world long past, not
consistent with the ideals and functions of democracy, capitalism or
modernity. We might imagine this to be true, but we would, in fact, be
wrong.
Dynastic power not only remains, but it evolves and adapts, and in the
present world of 'globalization',
-
with the growth of the modern
nation-states
-
with the development of state capitalist societies
-
the
banking and financial systems
-
the monetary-central banking system
-
industrialization and the multinational corporation,
...in a world largely
dominated by a single state,
the United States, acting as the international
imperial arbiter on behalf of powerful corporate and financial interests,
dynastic power remains a central institution in the global system.
There are, however, notable differences from past era of imperial and royal
families.
Today, most - but certainly not all - dynasties do not hold formal
or direct political authority. The world's most economically and politically
powerful countries are no longer governed by kings and queens or emperors.
Instead, modern dynastic power is largely a development that emerged with
the decline in the authority of monarchs, and with the rise in parliamentary
democracy and capitalism.
As the political and economic spheres began to be opened up, new structures
emerged to quickly centralize power within those spheres. As kings and
queens handed over the ultimate authority to issue coin to other
institutions, merchants and financiers stepped in to increase their
influence over the new institutions of a changing world order.
Out of these
monumental social transformations came new dynasties, embedded within the
financial, industrial and corporate oligarchies.
Their power was not in
direct control of the political apparatus, but in their concentration of
control over the financial, economic and industrial spheres. With that
power, inevitably, came both the desire and the ability to influence and
pressure the political sphere.
Today, it is the industrial, financial and corporate dynasties that have
risen to unparalleled positions of authority in the age of globalization.
And yet, while some of their names ring familiar to the ears of many, they
are frequently thought of as relics of past centuries rather than titans of
today, or their names are altogether unfamiliar, as is their positions and
influence within our societies.
We see power - typically - in terms of those
who hold political office: prime ministers and presidents who we elect, as
is consistent with our belief that we live in democracies. We see competing
factions of political parties vying for office, with us - the people - as
the ultimate arbiters of who gets to hold power.
The influence of
globalization's dynasties remains unseen, or, misunderstood.
When one hears the concept of relatively few families exerting unparalleled
influence over the modern world, the immediate reaction or insinuation is
that of a 'conspiracy theory'. Images of smoke-filled back rooms and
mentions of 'thirteen families' sitting around a table deciding world events
permeate the perceptions of those who question or are confronted with the
question of the role of powerful families in the modern world.
And yet, the
concept of dynastic rule - of families competing, cooperating, and indeed,
conspiring with and against each other for control and domination - are
prevalent and popular within our culture.
A perfect example of this is with the immense popularity of both the books
and the television show, 'Game of Thrones.'
Set in a mythical world, yet
largely based upon the historical rivalries of the 'War of the Roses', we
witness the characters evolve and events unfold as several families and
dynasties battle each other, conspire, compete and cooperate for control of
the known world.
They are frequently ruthless, cunning and deceitful, often
surrounded by 'yes men' or the poison-tongued advisers who rose to their
positions not by virtue of birth and name, but by their individual
capacities for manipulation and cunning.
It is a world in perpetual war,
engrossing poverty, with the privileged few sending the poor to fight their
battles for them, to die and suffer while the rich few propagate and
prosper.
With no lack of conspiracies, the greatest threat to individual
members of dynasties typically comes from their own or comparatively
powerful families. Issues of patriarchy, incest, blood-lust, and secession -
to the head of the family or the head of the throne - are consistent
throughout.
Indeed, the world of 'Game of Thrones' - so popular in our culture - is not
so far from the reality of our culture, itself. In the world of
globalization, families cooperate, compete, and perhaps even conspire
against and with each other or themselves. They keep the politics of
dynastic power from being understood or contemplated by the masses.
We are
distracted with sports, entertainment, 'royal weddings', a fear of
foreigners and terrorism, and are blinded and manipulated by a deeply
embedded propaganda system. Our celebrity culture celebrates banality and
irrelevance: we tune in to the latest Kim Kar-crash-ian disaster of a human
being that plasters the tabloids, while we tune out to the rivalries and
repercussions of 'Globalization's Game of Thrones'.
While modern dynasties share many characteristics of past ruling families,
they have their major distinctions, largely derived from the fact that most
of them do not hold formal political or absolute authority.
Past dynasties
typically held absolute authority over their local regions, states or
kingdoms.
That type of authority does not exist at the major state, regional
or global levels today, with few exceptions, such as the ruling monarchs of
the Gulf Arab dictatorships. Yet, while the mechanism of authority is less
centralized or formalized in the modern world, the scope and reach of
authority - or influence - has expanded exponentially.
In short, while in
past eras, a single family may have exerted absolute authority over a
comparably small region or empire, today, the indirect influence of a
dynastic family may reach across the globe, though it remains far from
absolute.
Thus, we should not mistake modern dynasties as replications of previous
ruling families. They are adaptations to the modern era.
With the emergence
and prevalence of globalization, multinational corporations, banks,
financial markets, philanthropic foundations, think tanks, media
conglomerates, educational institutions, public relations and the
advertising industries, financial and industrial oligarchs and dynasties
have come to be integrated with the nation-state structure.
Families that
have established modern dynasties typically rose to prominence through their
concentration of power and wealth in financial, industrial and corporate
spheres. From these positions, political power and influence became a
necessity, or else the loss of economic power would be an inevitability.
Such dynasties would frequently establish a 'family office' - a private
corporate entity - which would handle all of the investments, interests and
finances of a dynasty; they would create new
universities which would focus
on producing knowledge and intellectuals capable of managing changes within
and protecting the social order, instead of intellectual talents or pursuits
being channeled into areas that challenge the prevailing order.
Dynastic
families establish 'philanthropic foundations' to serve a dual purpose of
justifying their wealth and influence (by being perceived as 'giving back'),
but which, in actuality, provide concentrations of wealth managed for the
purpose of 'strategic giving':
to undertake social engineering projects with
an ultimate objective of maintaining social control.
While appearing to be
'charitable' institutions, the major foundations are predominantly
interested in the process of long-term social engineering.
Notably among
such foundations are the,
...among many others.
Not unrelated - as they are frequently established and funded by foundations
- think tanks are created with the intent to bring elite interests together
from a wide array of institutions:
financial, industrial, corporate,
academic/intellectual, media, cultural, foreign policy and political
spheres.
In think tanks, top officials from these sectors are gathered in a
single institution where they work together to plan strategies for economic
and foreign policies, for establishing consensus between elites, and to
serve as training and recruitment grounds for officials to enter the
political and foreign policy establishment, where they are capable of
enacting the very policies developed within the think tanks.
Notable think
tanks with immense influence - specifically in the United States - include,
Larger,
international think tanks have been increasingly common during the era of
globalization, uniting respective elites from across the powerful western
industrial states, instead of simply the elites within each respective
state.
Notable among these institutions are,
The prevalence of financial, industrial and corporate dynasties within these
institutions has ensured that such families have significant political
influence, and have - moreover - played pivotal roles in the construction
and evolution of our modern state-capitalist society.
Not coincidentally,
with the preservation and propagation of modern dynastic power has come the
preservation and propagation of modern imperialism, no longer established as
a formal colonial system of control.
Instead, it is represented as a complex
inter-dependency and interaction of institutions and ideologies that
manifest as a system of globalized 'informal imperialism', with the United
States at the center.
Some of the names of these dynasties are better known than others, like
Rothschild and Rockefeller, while others are better known within their own
countries or barely known at all, like,
-
Agnelli (in Italy)
-
Wallenberg (in Sweden)
-
Desmarais (in Canada)
Each family dynasty has their own unique
history, with power concentrated in particular companies or family offices.
Many, if not most, of these families also have significant connections with
each other, acting as joint shareholders in various companies, sitting on
the same boards and mingling in the same social circles.
They cooperate and
they compete with each other for influence in Globalization's 'Game of
Thrones'.
This series aims to bring to light some of the stories, players and
structures of the world's dominant dynasties.
The research included in this
series has been undertaken through The People's Book Project, a crowd-funded
initiative to produce a series of books examining the ideas, institutions
and individuals of power, as well as the methods and movements of resistance
in the modern world.
Part 2
- Managing the Wealth of the World's
Dynasties -
27 May 2014
In
Part 1 of this series ("Globalization's Game of Thrones") I
examined the concept of corporate and financial dynasties holding
significant power in the modern world.
In this, part 2 of the series, I
examine the realities of the 'wealth management' industry in being
responsible for handling the wealth and investments of the world's richest
families, and the role of a unique institution dedicated to protecting and
propagating dynastic wealth:
the family office.
A Family Affair
In 2010, Forbes - a major financial
publication which publishes an annual list of the world's richest people -
noted that the richest of the richest 400 Americans were members of
prominent
corporate and financial dynasties, with six of the top ten wealthiest
Americans being heirs to prominent fortunes, as opposed to being 'self-made'
billionaires.
What's more, since the financial crisis began in 2007 and
2008, the fortunes of these dynasties - and the other super-rich who made
the Forbes list - had only increased in value.
Corporate America can frequently be seen
as the emblem of the 'self-made' rich, a representation of a supposedly
democratic, capitalist society, where firms are run by "professional
managers" who received the right education and developed the appropriate
talents to make successful companies.
The reality, however, is that roughly
a third of the Fortune 500 companies (that is, many of the world's largest
multinational corporations) are in fact "family businesses," frequently run
by family members, and often outperforming the "professionally managed"
firms "by a surprisingly large margin," noted the
New York Times.
In other words, in the United States - the
beacon of the 'self-made' millionaire - a huge percentage of the most
successful companies are owned by family dynasties, and most of the richest
individuals are heirs to these family dynasties.
The picture that begins to
emerge better reflects that of an aristocracy, rather than a democracy.
As the New York Times noted in 2010,
"the increasing use of so-called dynasty trusts" was undermining the notion
that America was a meritocracy (where people 'rise through the ranks' of
society based upon merit instead of money, access or family lineage.
Dynastic trusts allow super-rich families,
"to provide their heirs with money
and property largely free from taxes and immune to the claims of creditors,"
not only providing for children, but "for generations in perpetuity - truly
creating an American aristocracy."
In laws that predate the formation of
the United States as an independent nation, such family trusts were only
able to limit the term of the existing trust to roughly 90 years, after
which the property and wealth which was consolidated into the trust would be
owned directly by the family members.
However, in changes that were
implemented through Congress in the mid-1980s and in state legislatures
across the U.S. in the 1990s, the rules were amended - with the pressure of
the banking lobby - to allow family trusts to exist "forever," a quiet coup
for the existing and emerging aristocratic American class.
Thus, the modern dynasty trust was officially
sanctioned as a legal entity - a type of private family company - that would
be responsible for handling the collective wealth - in money, property,
land, art, equities (stocks), bonds (debt), etc. - of the entire family, for
generation after generation.
The focus is on long-term planning to maintain,
protect and increase the wealth of the dynasty, and to hold it 'in trust'
against the inevitable in-fighting that accompanies dynastic succession and
generational differences.
This would prevent - in theory - one generation or
patriarch from mishandling and squandering the entire family fortune.
The legal structure of a family trust differs
greatly from public corporations, in that their focus is not on maximizing
short-term quarterly profits for shareholders, but in maintaining
multi-generational wealth and prestige. Family trusts are increasingly used
to manage the wealth of the world's super-rich dynasties, alongside private
banking institutions and other wealth management and consulting firms.
There
is an entire industry dedicated to the management of money, wealth and
investments for the super-rich, and it is focused largely - and increasingly
- on family dynasties.
Of Rockefellers and
Rothschilds
One of the world's most famous family trusts -
the "family office" - is that of
Rockefeller & Co., now known as Rockefeller
Financial.
It was founded in 1882 by the oil baron industrialist
John D.
Rockefeller as the 'family office' to manage the Rockefeller family's
investments and wealth. Roughly a century after it was founded, in the
1980s, Rockefeller & Co. began selling its 'expertise' to other rich
families, and by the year 2008, the trust had roughly
$28 billion under management for multiple clients.
When the CEO of Rockefeller & Co., James S.
McDonald, shot himself in an alley behind a car dealership in 2009, the
family looked for and found a successor in the former Undersecretary of
State for Economic, Energy, and Agricultural Affairs for the Bush
administration, Rueben Jeffery III, a former partner at Goldman Sachs.
Jeffery was responsible for handling the family's wealth throughout
the
global financial crisis, and by 2012, the assets under management by
Rockefeller Financial had
grown to $35 billion.
As of late 2012, Rockefeller & Co. had
approximately 298 separate clients, providing them with "financial,
trust, and tax advice." The typical clients for Rockefeller & Co. are
families with more than $30 million in investments, and the group charges
new clients a minimum annual fee of $100,000.
However, the family office has
increasingly been attracting clients beyond other family dynasties,
including major multinational corporations awash with cash in a world where
nation states are flooded in debt.
David Harris, the chief investment
officer of Rockefeller Financial, explained in a 2012 interview with
Barron's (a magazine for the super-rich), that as the world's nations
were stuck in a debt crisis, triple-A rated multinational conglomerates
represented "the
new sovereigns" with "unprecedented" amounts of cash to be invested.
And while prominent family trusts have become
increasingly attractive for other rich families and institutions to handle
their wealth, they have also become attractive investments in and of
themselves.
One of Europe's largest banks, the French conglomerate Société
Générale (SocGen) purchased a 37% stake in Rockefeller & Co. in June of
2008.
However, with the European debt crisis, the bank had to cut a great
deal of its assets, and so in 2012 Rueben Jeffery III managed the sale of
the 37% stake in the Rockefeller enterprise
from SocGen to RIT Capital Partners, the investment arm of the London
Rothschild family, one of the world's most famous financial dynasties.
Barron's
magazine noted that the official union of these two major financial
dynasties "should provide some valuable marketing opportunities" in such an
uncertain economic and financial landscape, where "new wealth" from around
the world would seek,
"to tap the joint expertise of these experienced
families that have managed to keep their heads down and their assets intact
over several generations and right through the upheavals of history."
Early in 2012, the Rothschild family, with
various banks and investment entities spread out across multiple European
nations and family branches, was making a concerted effort to begin the
process of,
"merging its French and British assets into a single entity,"
aiming to secure "long-term control" over the family's "international
banking empire," reported the
Financial Times.
The main goal of the merger was "to cement once
and for all
the family's grip on the business," giving the family a 57 percent share
in the voting rights, thus protecting the merged entity from hostile
takeovers.
Thus, as
the Rothschild banking dynasty was seeking to
consolidate its own family interests across Europe, they were simultaneously
looking to expand into the U.S. through the Rockefellers.
Thus, when Lord Jacob Rothschild - who managed
the British Rothschild's family trust, RIT Capital Partners - announced that
RIT would be purchasing a 37% stake in Rockefeller Financial Services in May
of 2012 for an,
"undisclosed sum," it was announced as a "strategic
partnership" that would allow the Rothschilds to gain "a much
sought-after foothold in the US," representing a "transatlantic union" that
officially unites the two family patriarchs of David Rockefeller and Jacob
Rothschild, "whose personal relationship spans five decades."
At the time of the announcement, David
Rockefeller, who was then 96-years-old, commented that,
"Lord Rothschild and
I have known each other for five decades.
The connection between the two families is very strong."
Rockefeller &
Co.'s CEO, Rueben Jeffery III, declared that,
"there is a shared vision, at
the conceptual and strategic level, that marrying the two names with
particular products, services, geographic market opportunities, can and will
have resonance. These are things we will want to act on as this partnership
and overall relationship evolves."
In a world where families hold immense
wealth and power, the official institutional union of two of the world's
most famous and recognizable dynastic names makes for an attractive
investment for newer dynasties seeking propagation and preservation.
The Family Office
As the Financial Times noted in 2013,
the "family office" for the world's wealthy dynasties, which had,
"long been
cloaked
in a shroud of secrecy as rich families have sought to keep their
personal fortunes private" has become more popular with "the explosion of
wealth in the past few decades and dissatisfaction with the poor performance
of portfolios handled by global private banks."
Still, many so-called
"single family offices" continue to operate in secrecy, managing the wealth
of a single dynasty, but the emergence of "multi-family offices" (MFOs) has
become an increasing trend in the world of wealth management, handling the
wealth and investments of multiple families.
The world's largest private banks have specific
"family office arms" which are dedicated to managing dynastic wealth, and
these banks continue to dominate the overall market.
Bloomberg Markets
published a list of the top 50 MFOs in 2013, with HSBC Private Wealth
Solutions topping the list, advising assets totaling $137.3 billion, with
other banks appearing on the top ten list such as BNY Mellon Wealth
Management, Pictet and UBS Global Family Office.
Despite the fact that the
family office arms of the world's top private banks dominate the list, many
of the oldest family offices made the list, such as Bessemer Trust and
Rockefeller & Co.
A top official at HSBC Private Bank was quoted by the
Financial Times
as saying:
"Very
wealthy families are becoming more and more globalized. It's not just
the fact that they are acquiring assets - like real estate - in several
jurisdictions, but family members are scattered around the globe and need to
be able to transact in those countries."
In effect, we are witnessing the
era of the globalization of family dynasties.
Such a view is shared by Carol Pepper, a former
financial adviser and portfolio manager at Rockefeller & Co. who established
her own consulting firm - Pepper International - in 2001, specializing in
advising families with more than $100 million in net worth.
In a 2013
interview with Barron's, Pepper explained that with the
globalization of higher education - where the super-rich from around the
world send their children to the same prominent academic institutions - as
well as with the emergence of associations designed to bring wealthy
families together, "the
19th century [is] coming back," referring to the era of
Robber Baron industrialists and co-operation between the major industrial
and financial fortunes of the era.
Pepper explained that in the present
global environment, she was witnessing,
"a lot more exchange of ideas among
wealthy families from different countries than there ever was before," with
such families increasingly investing in and with each other, noting that
"inter-family transactions" had increased by 60% in the previous two years.
The globalization of family dynasties and the
'return' to the 19th century is an institutional phenomenon,
facilitated by elite universities, business and family associations,
international organizations, conferences and other organizations.
Thus,
regardless of geographic location, the world's wealthiest families tend to
send their children to one of a list of relatively few elite universities,
such as Wharton, Harvard or the London School of Economics.
At these and
similar schools, noted Carol Pepper, the future heirs of family fortunes
attain,
"both the know-how and the contacts for forging overseas
collaborations between family businesses."
So-called 'non-profit' associations like the
International Family Office Association, the Family Business Network, and
ESAFON, among others, are institutional representations of "intentional
efforts by rich clans
to rub shoulders with one another."
Instead of a rich family in one
region hiring an outside firm to introduce them to a new market, they simply
are able to reach out directly to the wealthy families within that market,
and, as Pepper explained, their interests will be increasingly aligned and
"hopefully you'll all make money together."
Instead of relying on banks as intermediaries
between markets, rich families with more than $47 million to invest are
pooling their wealth into the multi-family offices (MFOs).
The Financial
Times explained that such wealthy families were,
"crying out for
something financial institutions have singularly failed to provide: a
one-stop shop to manage both their business and personal interests."
Further, as banks have been coming under increased scrutiny since the
financial crisis,
"there is still a clandestine nature to the family-office
world that will continue to attract clients."
Explaining this, the
Financial Times appropriately quoted advice by the character Don
Corleone from The Godfather, when
he told his son:
"Never
tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking."
As the Wall Street Journal noted,
family offices,
"are private firms that manage just about everything for the
wealthiest families: tax planning, investment management, estate planning,
philanthropy, art and wine collections - even the family vacation compound."
As such, regardless of where many family fortunes are made, the family
office has come to represent the central institution of modern dynasties.
And the growth of multi-family offices has been astounding, with the number
increasing by 33% between 2008 and 2013, with more than 4,000 in the United
States alone, the country with the highest number of wealthy families and
individuals, including 5,000 households that have more than $100 million in
assets.
The Wall Street Journal
noted:
"You
don't have to be a Rockefeller to join a family office."
However, it
does help to have hundreds of millions of dollars.
In 2012, the list of the largest multi-family
offices were largely associated with major banks, including HSBC, BNY
Mellon, UBS, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, but Rockefeller Financial
maintained a prominent position as
the 11th largest multi-family office (according to assets
under advisement and number of families being served).
And beyond the
specific arm of the 'multi-family office' to the list of the top wealth
management groups as a whole, private bank branches of some of the world's
most recognizable bank names dominated the list:
...among
others.
However, after the top 19 wealth management companies in the world -
all of which were arms of major global banking and financial services
conglomerates - came number twenty on the list:
Rockefeller Financial.
Indeed, things have never been better for the
super-rich. A 2012 poll of 1,000 wealthy Americans by the Merrill Lynch
Affluent Insights Survey revealed that 58% of respondents felt
more financially secure in 2012 than they did the previous year.
In
2013, U.S. Trust, the private banking arm of Bank of America, released a
survey of 711 individuals with more than $3 million in investable assets, of
whom
88% reported that they were more financially secure today than they were
before the financial crisis in 2007. Further, the main goal for the
super-rich in 2013 was reported to be "asset appreciation" as opposed to
"extreme caution", as the survey reported for 2012.
In 2013, Bloomberg Markets Magazine
reported that the number of wealthy people in the world with more than $1
million in investable assets had increased by 9.2% over 2012, reaching a new
record of 12 million individuals, and the assets by the rich increased by
roughly 10%, reaching a combined total of roughly
$46.2 trillion.
With this growth in extreme wealth, the wealth
management business is itself becoming a major growth industry, with
independent firms competing against the big banks in a race to manage the
spoils of the world's super-rich.
And the world's big banks want to get more of
this investable wealth.
For example, Goldman Sachs has boosted its private
wealth management services. The number of partners at the bank working in
asset management in 2010 represented 4.5% of the bank's total partners, a
number which grew to 12% by 2012.
Tucker York, the head of private wealth
management in the U.S. for Goldman Sachs, noted:
"This is a relationship
business,
and long-term relationships matter
The focus for us is to have the
right quality and caliber of people come into the business and stay in the
business for a long, long time."
The managing director and chief investment
officer of Goldman Sachs' private wealth management arm, Mossavar-Rahmani,
told Barron's in 2012:
"This is the time to be a long-term
investor
There are very few market participants in today's environment who
can truly be long-term investors.
Who can really afford to be a long-term
investor? The ultra-high-end client is the only one we could think of,
because they generally have more money than their spending needs."
In
addition, he noted,
"their assets are multigenerational," and, what's more,
"they
are not accountable to anyone."
In a world of immense inequality, with the
super-rich controlling more wealth than the rest of humanity combined, the
wealth management industry - and within it, the 'family office' - have
become growth industries and increasingly important institutions.
The whole
process of globalization has facilitated not only the internationalization
of financial markets, multinational corporations and the economies they
dominate, but it has in turn facilitated the globalization of family
dynasties themselves, whose wealth is largely based on control over
corporate and financial assets and institutions.
In globalization's 'Game of Thrones', the
world's super-rich families compete and cooperate for control not simply
over nations, but entire regions and the world as a whole.
As dynasties seek perpetuation, most people on
this planet are concerned with survival.
Whoever wins this 'Game of
Thrones,' the people lose.
