Agenda 21 wants to, among other things,
bring the American lands back to rewilding.
The non-governmental organization (NGO) The Wildlands Project (WP)
is a focusing of the American landscape in preservation for future
generations to inherit a continent rich in wildlife, with plenty of room for
all species to roam.
This does not necessarily mean that there will be room for humans as we are
seeing massive areas of land being placed under restrictions called
conservation easements, scenic byways, protected areas, biosphere
reserves, wildlife refuges, etc.
The names are varied and plentiful, but the
result is always the same: More government control; less human freedom.
The WP claims we are,
experiencing the Sixth Great Extinction
because of human population growth, climate change, resource
extraction, new recreational technologies, habitat fragmentation.
Since humanity is not a,
highly interactive species (meaning
species whose presence maintains the balance of other plant and animal
species with the habitat they share) we are running out of room to
share with nature.
The science-based agenda of WP has developed the
solution of dividing up North America into,
four Continental Wildways [of] large
protected corridors of land running coast to coast... throughout Canada,
the US and Mexico.
Agenda 21 explains why the
North
American Union is being pushed by the globalists.
-
The
Eastern Wildway extending northward
from the Everglades along the Appalachians to the Arctic
-
The
Western Wildway spanning the
continent from Mexico, through the Rockies, to Alaska
-
The
Pacific Wildway running from Baja
to Alaska
-
The
Boreal Wildway running west-east
from Alaska to the Canadian Maritimes across the forest roof of
North America
The wildways are,
constructed by protecting core areas
connected to one another by corridors or linkages. They are essentially
mosaics of connected public and private lands that provide habitat and
safe passageways for wildlife to travel freely from place to place.
In the January 2012
Review of Implementation of Agenda 21 and the Rio
Principles details the progress the UN has had on their Agenda 21
policies on the local and national levels.
Under the World Trade Organization (WTO) the UN has seen major advances in
the developing countries (i.e. Africa, India, Southeast Asia) where they
have,
embraced the reforms of the WTO regime
where global import tariffs have been used as protective measures
since 1995.
National subsidies have turned agricultural
commodities over to
the global Elite International cooperation
and recognition of the UNs superiority in the implementation of their
schemes.
Through the World Bank (WB) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the manipulation of the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) uses reinvested funds that
are dumped into UN approved public service programs, healthcare and
education.
According to research from the International Institute for Applied
Systems Analysis (IIASA)
the issues caused by man-made climate change and its impact on the
environment cannot be resolved by a single country or member of academia,
but through the IIASA and the UN the securitization of energy on a national
level can be reworked to reflect Agenda 21 Sustainable Development.
IIASA research has turned up a
strategic plan that:
-
Controls the allocation of energy to
individuals and businesses
-
Control transportation and production of
global food
-
Control water resources used for
agriculture and personal
-
Allocate resources under UN guidelines
of mitigation of CO2 emissions
Research focuses on the transformational nature
of the modern world. IIASA is one of the foundations of the global
transformation of local communities to reflect Agenda 21.
One way Agenda 21 is manifesting right now is in
Transition Towns . Under the
Transition Model , global relocalization
agendas are forefront.
The
dangers that Transition Towns impose on our
sovereignty and individuality are:
-
Refocus town planning and infrastructure
on implementation of Agenda 21
-
Appear to be grassroots operations
-
Promote the Peak Oil mythology as an
energy scare-tactic
-
Support SmarthGrowth which is code for
Agenda 21
-
Aspire to control framing, disburse
ability to farm, and pressure governmental policies on farming that
reflect Agenda 21
-
Use the hoax of man-made climate change
as the purpose for imposing policy control by building cities that
are designed to reduce carbon emissions
-
Securitize local food stores,
businesses, healthcare and fuel
-
Ensure SmarthGrowth controls all
citizens ability to acquire any needs for human survival
-
Create internal advocacies that band
together to purvey Transition Town propaganda to elected officials
and local governments
The European Union has
adopted regulations that ban the
construction of single-family homes beginning in 2020.
These new dwellings, called passive houses will
be zero-energy buildings.
To control urban communities in so far as
tangible spatial development and the literal process of construction,
Germany is creating policies that facilitate compact housing that is more
energy efficient.
During the recent UN Earth Summit on Sustainable Development in Rio+20,
governments and private sector
corporations have pledged to fund the UNs endeavors toward
global governance with a generous $513 billion for Agenda 21 projects that
will restrict the movements of humans, perverse biodiversity and assist the
UN in attaining their Millennium Development Goals.
Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State supports the incorporation of
the Agenda 21 movement.
She remarked that,
sustainability wont happen without
business investment. Governments alone cannot solve all the problems we
face, from climate change to persistent poverty to chronic energy
shortages. Thats why we are so strongly in favor of partnerships.
As far as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is
concerned, the money from corporations and governments cannot come at a
better time.
Ki-moon claims that words must translate into
action with regard to moving the environmental governance agenda forward.
Ki-moon says that since the first UNCSD, the incremental slide toward total
global governance has spawned UN conventions on climate change, biodiversity
and desertification, as well as the Agenda 21 blueprint for sustainable
development, yet,
progress has been too slow - we have not
gone far enough down the road. We are now in sight of a historic
agreement - the world is waiting to see if words will translate into
action, as we know they must.
The UN Environmental Program (UNEP)
has been
expanded to become a specialized agency
with a new title, UN Environmental Organization (UNEO).
The UNEO will prop up the Sustainable
Development division of the UN. The same agency that disseminates Agenda 21
policies to governments will be centralized into a global agency with
powerful international backing.
Ban Ki-moon, UN Secretary General devised the global sustainability
panel that includes more than 50 supporters of the creation of UNEO.
One option is the possible transformation
of UNEP into a specialized agency of the United Nations.
A strengthened UNEP could enhance coherence
between relevant multilateral environmental agreements, and better
integrate its work with the activities of development institutions,
especially the United Nations Development Program, states one
recommendation.
To fund
globalization,
the
United Nations will
disburse a global carbon tax, redistribute
the worlds wealth and install programs that will place all issues
concerning humanity, poverty, the securitization of resources and education
under its control and command.
They will force ecological taxes to steer large amounts of money into funds
designed to redesign humanity, civilization and the planet - and fit them
all into their mold. A carbon cap-and-trade tax system for industrial
countries could yield $250 billion per year.
Through consolidation of power within the UN, the Agenda 21 scheme is being
implemented locally; and finding success as fake grassroots efforts. The
global Elite have perfected the art of convincing the general public that
sustainability is a good idea.
By employing them to pressure their local and
state governments for adherence to UN Agenda 21 schemes, their work is easy.
It is up to us to recognize that the sustainable
legislation we are unknowingly pushing our elected officials to approve are
contributing to the loss of our independence and sovereignty as a
Constitutional Republic governed by our own laws.
Once we do this, we will no longer be manipulated into supporting the UNs
global governance agenda and once again be a free nation.
