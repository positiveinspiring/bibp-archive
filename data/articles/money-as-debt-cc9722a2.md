Money is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by
the fact that it is impersonal, there is no human relation between master
and slave.
Debt- government, corporate and household has reached
astronomical proportions. Where does all this money come from? How could
there BE that much money to lend? The answer is
there isnt. Today, MONEY IS
DEBT. If there were NO DEBT there would be NO MONEY.
If this is puzzling to you, you are not alone. Very few people understand,
even though all of us are affected.
This fast-paced and highly entertaining
animated feature by artist & videographer, Paul Grignon explains todays
magically perverse DEBT-MONEY SYSTEM in terms that are easy to understand.

Paul Grignon's second presentation of "Money as Debt" tells in very simple
and effective graphic terms what money is and how it is being created.
It is
an entertaining way to get the message out. The Cowichan Citizens Coalition
and its "Duncan Initiative" received high praise from those who previewed
it. I recommend it as a painless but hard-hitting educational tool and
encourage the widest distribution and use by all groups concerned with the
present unsustainable monetary system in Canada, the United States and in
whole Europe.
Bailouts, stimulus packages, debt piled upon debt
And now, all of a sudden, the bankers have no money and we the taxpayers,
have to rescue them by going even further into debt!
Money as debt 2 explores the baffling, fraudulent and destructive arithmetic
of the money system that holds us hostage to a forever growing DEBT
and how
we might evolve beyond it into a new era.

Evolution Beyond Money

This third and final movie in the Money as Debt trilogy presents a
comprehensive picture of how money could work in the future.
It is a blueprint full of surprising specifics for creating a whole new
system applied with technologies that exist right now.
Part 3 demonstrates in simple terms why our primitive concept of
money as a single uniform commodity is the ROOT cause of money system
dysfunction and a major factor in economic and political injustice.
There is
now, and there has long been, an alternative way to do money.
Part 3 illustrates in extensive and
entertaining detail, how a fundamental change in our long-held concept of
money, paired with recent breakthroughs in technology opens the door to a
self-generating, self-balancing and sustainable global money backed by
REAL VALUE and OPEN to ALL.
