This is what a permanent underclass looks like.
Spain is in a great depression, and it is
one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen.
Five years after its housing boom turned to
bust, Spanish unemployment hit a record high of 27.2
percent in the first quarter of 2013. It's almost too horrible to
comprehend, but 19.5 percent of the total workforce has not had a
job in the past six months; 15.3 percent have not in the past year; and
9.2 percent have not in the past two years.
You can see this 1930s-style catastrophe in
the chart below from the
National Statistics Institute.
(Note: The "already found
work" category refers to people who did not have a job at the time of
the survey, but did have a job lined up).
Here's the story of Spanish unemployment in
three acts.
During the boom, joblessness was relatively
high due to
persistent structural problems. Then it shot up fast and faster as
Spain's building bust and then Lehmangeddon hit in 2008. But it has kept
climbing up since the panic abated, albeit at a less catastrophic pace,
due to the toxic combination of too tight money and budgets.
In other words, austerity hasn't been the
path to prosperity. It's been the path to perma-slump.
But the real story of the Spanish depression
has been the story of the
indignados: the
mostly young, long-term unemployed. It's a bit hard to see just how
dramatic it's been in the chart above, so I converted it to a line chart
below.
Almost all of the increase in unemployment
since 2010 has been due to the increase in long-term unemployment of two
years or more.
In other words, unemployment is a trap
people fall into, but can't fall out of.
Indeed, the rate of new unemployment
has stabilized at a terrible, but not quite-as-terrible, level, as you
can see with the flat blue, red, and green lines. But the steadily
rising purple line shows us that the rate of job-finding for the jobless
has collapsed.
That is what a permanent underclass looks like.
Housing Lows and
Hiring Laws Feed a Disaster
Why has Spain's jobs depression been so
great?
After all, its GDP is "only"
4.1 percent below its 2007 level, compared to 5.8 percent below for
Portugal, 7 percent below for Italy, and 20 percent below for Greece.
But despite this better (negative) growth, unemployment is higher in
Spain than the others.
In other words, Spanish unemployment isn't
just about inadequate demand. Part of it is structural.
Spain's labor market problems fall into two
big buckets: too much regulation, and not enough education. It's almost
impossible for companies to get rid of older workers, which creates a
horribly bifurcated labor market. There are permanent workers who can't
be fired, and temporary ones who can - and are. Indeed, as
Clive Crook points out, about a third of Spain's workforce are
temporary workers who enjoy few protections and fewer opportunities.
Companies go through these younger workers
without bothering to invest much in their human capital, because why
would they?
These temporary workers will be let go at
the first sign of economic trouble. Young people get stuck in a
never-ending cycle of under-and-unemployment since firms are always
hesitant to hire permanent workers who will always be on their books.
But it gets worse. The housing bust hasn't
just cast a shadow over household and bank balance sheets; it's cast one
over young people's educations too.
At its peak, building made up a whopping 19
percent of Spain's economy, which, as
Tobias Buck of the Financial Times points out, lured many
young men into dropping out of school for well-paying construction gigs.
But now that building has gone into hibernation, all of those young men
are left with no work and no education to fall back on.
And, again, even if they can find temporary
jobs, it's not as if the companies will spend money to develop their
skills.
It's hard to see anything resembling a case
for optimism.
Even though the Spanish government's
borrowing costs have fallen since the ECB introduced its backstop, Spanish
business borrowing costs have not. Small and medium-sized
enterprises can't get capital except on prohibitively expensive terms.
As
Ryan Avent of The Economist points out, this broken monetary
transmission mechanism means austerity is hurting Spain more than it
otherwise would - which is clear enough in the data. Despite its cuts,
Spain's deficit actually worsened from 9.4 percent of GDP in 2011 to
10.6 percent of GDP in 2012, because its economy fell more than its
borrowing costs.
The only hint of good news here is Spain
just announced it will take two
more years to hit its deficit target.
But less (self-defeating) austerity isn't
enough. Spain needs stimulus. And it might need bailouts too (or, if
Cyprus does turn
out to be a "template", bail-ins). Indeed, The Economist calculates
Spanish housing prices are still
overvalued by 20 percent or so - which will be even more bad news
for its banks.
I wasn't exaggerating when I said this is
one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen.
Spain needs shock therapy for its labor
markets, but that's an impossible political sell when more than a
quarter of the population is unemployed.
-
In an ideal world, Spain would
pair major reforms with major stimulus
-
In the real world, it will drag
its feet on reforms, try to cut its deficit, and fall deeper into
depression
Let me leave you with this, well, depressing
question:
Assuming everything goes perfectly, how long will it be till
Spanish unemployment gets below 20 percent?
Don't answer that...
