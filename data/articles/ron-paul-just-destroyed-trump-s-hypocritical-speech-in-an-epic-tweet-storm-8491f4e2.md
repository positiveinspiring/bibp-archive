Champion of
freedom and liberty, Dr.
Ron Paul, decided to grade
President
Donald Trump's speech last
night, in real time.
The final
result of his series of tweets is nothing short of incredible
and highlights how blinded some have become to the grandiose
persona of The Donald - ignoring all his broken
promises and audaciously excusing his championing of the police
and warfare states.
When I saw the
following tweet in my Twitter feed last night, I got giddy like
a kid on Christmas as I know that Ron Paul is the one person who
refuses to compromise on principle and is unafraid of backlash
for calling out the hypocrisy and warmongering of the
establishment - including Trump.
Opening up his
speech, Trump promised to increase military spending. In fact,
he announced this week that his administration will increase the
already massive and bloated
military budget by a whopping $54 billion.
Trump then
promised that,
"Crumbling
infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges,
tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very
very beautiful land."
This sounds
fine and dandy, however, Paul pointed out the obvious:
After
expressing his support for the massive creation of debt using
the Federal Reserve, Trump went on to champion his executive
order that granted Energy Transfer Partners permission to take
treaty land from Native Americans and grant it to big oil.
Again, Paul
called out the hypocrisy in such a move.
As
we reported yesterday, the Trump administration just
announced that they will abandon DoJ investigations into police
as Jeff Sessions, who hasn't bothered reading any of the
investigations, thinks it's a waste of time.
Instead of
taking problem cops off the street, the DoJ, under the tyranny
of Jeff Sessions, will blow wind back into the sails that is the
immoral, inhumane, costly, and deadly war on drugs.
"We want
all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an
environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and
the rule of law at our borders," Trump exclaimed to be met
with applause.
"For
that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great,
great wall along our southern border."
In under 140
characters, the brilliant Paul completely dismantled Trump's
entire delusional Chinese emperor-esque arguments for his "great
wall."
In perhaps my
favorite tweet of the night, Ron Paul answered Trump's fear
mongering of "radical Islamic terrorism" with logic and reason
instead of islamophobic emotion. As the Free Thought Project has
reported on extensively,
US foreign policy creates
terrorism.
These people
don't "hate our freedom" - they hate our bombs blowing up their
children.
It's called blowback Trump,
you should research it.
"According
to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast
majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and
terrorism-related offense since 9/11 came here from outside
of our country," Trump spewed his carefully crafted sentence
to make it seem as if terrorism in the US mostly comes from
Islam.
However, as
we've pointed out on many occasions, Trump's travel ban did not
restrict individuals from the countries who actually committed
the acts of terror.
And, white
Americans who carry out mass shootings and horrid acts of terror
are
almost never
charged with terrorism.
Ron Paul went
on to warn against Trump's ominous promises to strongly vet
those who want to travel to the US. As the travel ban has
already shown, innocent Americans are ensnared and humiliated by
its aggressive implementation.
This will only
get worse.
In true neocon
fashion, Trump then went on to swear his allegiance to the state
of Israel and promise more war - this time with Iran, who hasn't
attacked another country in centuries.
"I have also imposed new
sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's
ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable
alliance with the state of Israel,"
he said.
Then, Trump
went on to shamelessly promote the police and warfare state by
carefully selecting audience members whose violent inner-city
tragedies he could exploit.
Again, Ron Paul
blew his police state argument out of the water.
On top of the
victims of inner city violence, Trump also shamelessly exploited
the widow of the Navy seal who died in the botched Yemen raid -
as a disgusting and overt blasting of warfare propaganda.
Trump went on
to lie and call the raid in Yemen a success, in spite the slew
of backlash he got for it and the
fake 'intelligence' the Pentagon got exposed for promoting
-
that was a decade old.
Again, Ron Paul
shredded him.
After running
on a platform to get the US out of NATO, Trump, like all
politicians do, switched his stance and began to promote it.
"We
strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds
of two World Wars that dethroned fascism," he said.
Trump then
hilariously claimed that the US respects the rights of all
nations, while simultaneously supporting the massive military
industrial complex spreading through more than 100 countries
across the world.
"Free
nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the
people - and America respects the right of all nations to
chart their own path." he said.
Ron Paul took
that opportunity to state the obvious.
At the end of
the speech, Ron Paul gave Trump letter grades on his visions and
how he intends to get there. Trump failed.
Thank you, Ron
Paul, for your unwavering support of liberty, even in the face
of popular ignorance.
As for those
who supported Trump for all the items he's since reneged on,
it's time to wake up.
Trump, like all
other puppets before him, are subject to the unelected
Shadow Government which
maintains control no matter
who's in the White House...
