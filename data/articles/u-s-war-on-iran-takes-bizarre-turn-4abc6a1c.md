# U.S. War on Iran Takes Bizarre Turn

General Hughs speech titled, "Making
Iranian mullahs fear, the MEK, come true" (below video:
0:00:33), was most likely
never meant to be seen or fully understood by Americans. In
titled alone, it is clear that U.S. foreign policy intends to use
the tool of terrorism to exact concessions from Tehran.
If the
true nature of Americas support for terrorist organizations
like MEK were more widely known, the current narrative driving
U.S. intervention in Iraq and Syria would crumble.
MEK Has Killed U.S. Servicemen,
Contractors, and Iranian Civilians For Decades
MEK has carried out decades of brutal terrorist
attacks, assassinations, and espionage against the Iranian
government and its people, as well as targeting Americans
including,
Admissions to the deaths of the Rockwell
International employees can be found within a
report written by former U.S. State Department
and Department of Defense official Lincoln Bloomfield Jr. on behalf of the
lobbying firm Akin
Gump in an attempt to dismiss concerns over MEKs violent
past and how it connects to its current campaign of armed terror
- a testament to the depths of depravity from which Washington
and London lobbyists operate.
To this day MEK terrorists have been carrying out
attacks inside of Iran killing political opponents, attacking
civilian targets, as well as carrying out the U.S.-Israeli
program of
targeting and assassinating
Iranian scientists.
MEK terrorists are also suspected of
handling patsies in recent
false flag operations, carried
out
in India,
Georgia, and Thailand, which have been ham-handedly blamed on the Iranian
government by the United States and Israel.
MEK
is described by
Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Senior Fellow Ray Takeyh as a
"cult-like organization" with "totalitarian tendencies."
While Takeyh fails to expand on what he meant by "cult-like" and
"totalitarian," an
interview with U.S. State Department-run
Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty reported that a MEK Camp Ashraf escapee claimed the
terrorist organization bans marriage, using radios, the
Internet, and holds many members against their will with the
threat of death if ever they are caught attempting to escape.
U.S. Has Been Eagerly Supporting MEK
Terrorists For Years
Besides providing MEK terrorists with now two
former U.S. military bases in Iraq as safe havens, the U.S. has
conspired to arm, fund, and back MEK for years in a proxy war
against Iran.
Covert support for the U.S.-listed terrorist group
Mujahedeen e-Khalq (MEK) has been ongoing since at least 2008
under the Bush administration, when Seymour Hershs 2008
New Yorker article "Preparing the Battlefield," reported
that not only had MEK been considered for their role as a
possible proxy, but that the U.S. had already begun arming and
financing them to wage war inside Iran:
The M.E.K. has been on the State
Departments terrorist list for more than a decade, yet in
recent years the group has received arms and intelligence,
directly or indirectly, from the United States.
Some of the
newly authorized covert funds, the Pentagon consultant told
me, may well end up in M.E.K. coffers.
"The new task force
will work with the M.E.K. The Administration is desperate
for results."
He added,
"The M.E.K. has no C.P.A. auditing
the books, and its leaders are thought to have been lining
their pockets for years.
If people only knew what the M.E.K.
is getting, and how much is going to its bank accounts - and
yet it is almost useless for the purposes the Administration
intends.
More recently, the British Daily Mail
published a stunning admission by "U.S. officials" that
Israel is currently funding, training, arming, and working
directly with MEK.
The Daily Mail article states:
Seymore Hersh
in an NPR interview,
also claims that select MEK members have already received
training in the U.S.
U.S. officials
confirmed today that Israel has been funding and training
Iranian dissidents to assassinate nuclear scientists
involved in Irans nuclear program. Washington insiders
confirmed there is a close relationship between Mossad and
MEK.
In 2009, an extensive conspiracy was formulated
within U.S. policy think-tank Brookings Institutions 2009 "Which
Path to Persia?" report, proposing to fully arm,
train, and back MEK as it waged a campaign of armed terror
against the Iranian people.
In their report, they openly conspire to use what
is an admitted terrorist organization as a "U.S. proxy":
"Perhaps the
most prominent (and certainly the most controversial)
opposition group that has attracted attention as a potential
U.S. proxy is the NCRI (National Council of Resistance of
Iran), the political movement established by the MEK
(Mujahedin-e Khalq).
Critics
believe the group to be undemocratic and unpopular, and
indeed anti-American.
In contrast,
the groups champions contend that the movements
long-standing opposition to the Iranian regime and record of
successful attacks on and intelligence-gathering operations
against the regime make it worthy of U.S. support. They also
argue that the group is no longer anti-American and question
the merit of earlier accusations.
Raymond Tanter,
one of the groups supporters in the United States, contends
that the MEK and the NCRI are allies for regime change in
Tehran and also act as a useful proxy for gathering
intelligence.
The MEKs
greatest intelligence coup was the provision of intelligence
in 2002 that led to the discovery of a secret site in Iran
for enriching uranium.
Despite its
defenders claims, the MEK remains on the U.S. government
list of foreign terrorist organizations. In the 1970s, the
group killed three U.S. officers and three civilian
contractors in Iran. During the 1979-1980 hostage crisis,
the group praised the decision to take America hostages and
Elaine Sciolino reported that while group leaders publicly
condemned the 9/11 attacks, within the group celebrations
were widespread.
Undeniably,
the group has conducted terrorist attacks - often excused by
the MEKs advocates because they are directed against the
Iranian government.
For example,
in 1981, the group bombed the headquarters of the Islamic
Republic Party, which was then the clerical leaderships
main political organization, killing an estimated 70 senior
officials. More recently, the group has claimed credit for
over a dozen mortar attacks, assassinations, and other
assaults on Iranian civilian and military targets between
1998 and 2001.
At the very
least, to work more closely with the group (at least in an
overt manner), Washington would need to remove it from the
list of foreign terrorist organizations."
Besides U.S. Army General Hugh Shelton,
other prominent U.S. politicians to literally stand before crowds
of baying MEK terrorists and their supporters include:
-
former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani
-
Howard Dean
-
Tom Ridge
-
John Lewis
-
Ed Rendell
-
former ambassador
John Bolton
-
former FBI Director Louis Freeh
-
retired General Wesley Clark
-
Lee Hamilton
-
former U.S. Marine Corps Commandant General
James Jones
-
Alan Dershowitz
U.S. Congresswoman
Nancy Pelosi would also stand in front of MEK terrorists
to deliver to them an Iranian New Year "greeting."
Blind Lust for Global
Hegemony is Leading America Over a Cliff
What it says about American foreign policy, to
trick U.S. servicemen and women into dying in far off lands to
"fight terrorism" when U.S. politicians in the highest positions
of power openly pledge support to terrorism - using it as a
battering ram against its enemies abroad, and failing to topple
them by proxy, using their own terrorist hordes as
a pretext for direct military intervention to do so - is that
such policy is underpinned by nothing more than blind lust for
power, wealth, and influence in senseless pursuit of global
hegemony.
There is no guiding principles of peace,
stability, democracy, freedom, or any confining principles of
humanity that prohibit U.S. foreign policy from exercising the
most abhorrent practices in order to achieve its goals.
Failure to identify these interests blindly
chasing hegemony at the cost of global peace and prosperity
leads not only America over a cliff into a ravine of madness,
but the entire world as well.
That a U.S. general can stand before terrorists
even as the U.S. bombs two nations in the name of fighting
terrorism, is but a glimpse into this madness.
For America and the Western aligned nations and
interests caught in its orbit, there is no future. Chasing
hegemony for the sake of hegemony alone leaves no room for
actual progress.
When anything and everything obstructing the path
to hegemony is seen as an "enemy" to be destroyed by any means
necessary, that includes setting aside resources and attention
to solving some of the most pressing issues of our time - health
care, infrastructure, education, better jobs, peace, and
prosperity.
All of these are seen as obstacles toward
hegemony, and the very same interests standing before MEK
terrorists pledging Americas resources to their campaign of
terrorism against Iran, are the same interests calling for and
implementing austerity upon the American people to continuously
fuel its foreign adventures.
