The attacks on
September 11, 2001 have been a defining moment for America.
Although the losses were not great in terms of
urban slaughter during WWII, the political and psychological impact on
Americans of a concerted and visible attack in America were enormous -
indeed, it is an interesting coincidence that the attacks occurred on the
one day of the year whose mention reinforces a public sense here of
danger and emergency: 9-1-1.
With remarkably little reflection or concern with details and evidence,
Americans accepted sweeping restrictions on civil liberties, torture
as an instrument of government policy, and waged wars first in Afghanistan
and later in Iraq, presumably punishing those who attacked America then or
might do so in the future.
A similar if less enthusiastic drama is
unfolding today, as many of the same parties who brought us 9/11,
Afghanistan and Iraq are edging America into confrontation and war with
Iran.
Like most Americans, I take a dim view of a fixation on conspiracies.
I am also conscious of a remark by a French
colleague some years ago to the effect that Europeans saw conspiracies
everywhere, but Americans never saw them anywhere, and both were wrong. I am
even less enthusiastic about presumed coincidences with global consequences
driving policy, or superficial explanations of physical catastrophes that
fly in the face of both logic and physical realities.
With one war waning today, another getting
hotter and a third in the oven, it is high time to look hard at what
brought us to this place.
Prelude to 9/11
Most of the world (but not Americans) understood for decades that American
Middle East policy was weighted heavily towards Israel.
Eisenhower could compel Israel to withdraw from
the Sinai, but the last US President who forcefully opposed Israeli regional
and nuclear ambitions was John F. Kennedy. His assassination brought Lyndon
Johnson into the White House, so much a friend of Israel that he disregarded
the deliberate Israeli attack on the USS Liberty during the 1967 war, in
which over 200 US sailors and Marines were killed or wounded.
Shortly thereafter, pilgrimages to Israel and laudatory appearances before
AIPAC (the powerful Jewish lobby in
Washington) became effectively obligatory for Presidents and serious
aspirants for the White House alike, with the Congress (both houses, both
parties) being even more supportive - something commonly understood in
Washington, but almost unknown elsewhere in the country.
A significant development in the 1990s was the formation of the
neo-conservative think tank known as
PNAC (Project for a New American Century),
whose members prepared position papers for the Israeli government and for a
future US Administration sharing their views.
That happened in 2000 with the election of
George W. Bush, and a contemporary writer summarized the tip
of the neo-conservative iceberg in his first Administration this way:
The outsiders from PNAC were now powerful
insiders, placed in important positions from which they could exert
maximum pressure on U.S. policy:
-
Cheney is Vice President
-
Rumsfeld is Defense Secretary
-
Wolfowitz is Deputy Defense
Secretary
-
I. Lewis Libby is Cheneys Chief of
Staff
-
Elliot Abrams is in charge of Middle
East policy at the National Security Council
-
Dov Zakheim is comptroller for the
Defense Department
-
John Bolton is Undersecretary of
State
-
Richard Perle is chair of the
Defense Policy advisory board at the Pentagon
-
former CIA director James Woolsey is
on that panel as well, etc. etc.
-
(PNACs chairman, Bill Kristol, is
the editor of The Weekly Standard.)
In short, PNAC had a lock on military
policy-creation in
the Bush Administration.
The presence of so many people from PNAC in key
positions definitely sent a signal that US Middle East policy would
henceforth be that of Israel, something that brought no joy to any other
countries in the region, much less the long-suffering Palestinians.
Mutterings about a supposed Road Map to some
type of peace arrangement in such circumstances were utterly meaningless,
and almost everyone except the American public understood this fact of life.
Far more significant in terms of subsequent events was the acknowledgement
in one of PNACs own documents that their program for America (and
Israel) would not readily be accepted by the American people.
What this meant,
PNAC opined in 2000, was that,
the process of transformation, even if it
brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some
catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a new Pearl Harbor.
9/11 Reconsidered
On September 11, 2001, the PNAC people in and out of government - and by
extension AIPAC and Israel - coincidentally got the event they needed,
barely eight months after coming into office.
Most people are familiar with the basic details
of that day - two commercial aircrafts crashing into the two tallest
buildings in New York Citys World Trade Center (WTC), a third striking the
Pentagon, and a fourth ending up in a Pennsylvania field. Few people will
forget the images of the burning buildings, their collapse, the casualties,
and the sense of shock and tragedy that ensued.
Few should forget the passage of emergency
legislation (the misnamed Patriot
Act), the rush to attack Afghanistan for harboring the source of
the attackers, or the later rush to attack Iraq to forestall mushroom
clouds from its apocryphal weapons of mass destruction.
The official 9/11 Commissions work and report were at best an incomplete
exercise. Many people dismiss the findings of the Commission, and that
includes its co-chairs.
Many others who utterly distrust the 9/11
Commission report, dismiss the US Governments explanation of it, and point
to both an official cover-up and an inside job, include veteran fighter
pilots, EMTs (Emergency Medical Technicians) (EMT
interview), air defense experts, experienced commercial pilots,
demolition experts, architects and civil engineers - none of them
professions that inherently attract and retain the gullible and credulous.
Errors abound in the report.
Among the more catastrophic is the collapse of
a third WTC building (the 47-story WTC7) which was not hit by a plane, and
fell in what appears to be a controlled demolition, but has essentially been
sidestepped by
the mainstream media (MSM).
And this video interview (above video) with a
demolitions expert overseas explains clearly and succinctly what happened to
WTC7, with the shock and chaos accompanying the impact of the aircraft
serving to distract attention and conceal what happened overall.
The overlay of the World Trade Center below
shows the layout of the affected buildings:
Even more unbelievable is the coincidental
salvage of an intact passport presumably belonging to one of the hijackers
inside the plane that hit WTC2 - and this was how the official 9/11
Commission report described it:
The passport was recovered by NYPD Detective
Yuk H. Chin from a male
passerby in a business suit, about 30 years old. The passerby left before
being identified, while debris was falling from WTC 2. The tower collapsed
shortly afterwards. The detective then gave the passport to the FBI
on 9/11.

Reflections
Several things are very clear to me from a careful assessment of both
official and critical evaluations of the 9/11 attacks.
-
First, the striking aircraft
alone simply could not have brought down either of the two buildings
in the manner in which they fell, much less a third building which
was not hit by a plane (I expect the one intended to do that as a
cover had ended up in that Pennsylvania field), given the
available physical evidence and a wealth of expert testimony.
This means the attackers had assistance
on the ground, and it had to have been active before the attacks
occurred: preparing buildings for controlled demolition is not
something done haphazardly in the midst of chaos.
-
Second, only two intelligence
agencies had the expertise, assets, access and political protection
to execute 9/11 in the air and on the ground: our CIA and Israels
Mossad.
Only one had the incentive, using the
who benefits principle: Mossad.
And that incentive dovetailed
perfectly with the neo-cons agenda and explicitly expressed need
for a catalytic event to mobilize the American public for their
wars, using American military power to destroy Israels enemies.
Only the unexpected strength of the Iraqi resistance kept Syria and
Iran from being attacked in the second
Bush Administration.
Thus, the evidential trail for 9/11 and
the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq run from PNAC, AIPAC and their
cohorts; through the mostly Jewish neo-cons in the Bush
Administration; and back to the Israeli government. None of the
denials and political machinations can alter that essential reality.
Terms such as treason, betrayal and
deceit do not overstate the case against them.
-
Finally, we need to take a hard
look at why the mainstream media (MSM) have paid more attention to
Sarah Palins wardrobe than they have to dissecting blatant
falsehoods, discrepancies and inconsistencies in the US Governments
treatment of 9/11 and its aftermath.
And the reason is that on this issue,
all are on the same side, and the official line is the one they all
prefer - all meaning the PNAC alumni who took over the Bush
Administrations national security apparatus and their counterparts
in the Obama administration, AIPAC and the rest of the numerous
Jewish PACs, the MSM owners and Israel.
The depiction of the media management in America
in 2002 is especially informative, and has not changed significantly since
then:
Today we are getting the same line on Iran, from
the same type of people - Obama himself tries to be more independent, but
most of the key staff and national security people in his Administration do
not differ greatly on Israel and the Middle East from those of
his
predecessor.
And the Congress has shown itself to be even
more of AIPACs lap-dog than the preceding Congress, an exercise in
self-serving cowardice that admittedly has taken some doing.
This is not a
simple anti-Jewish canard or mindless prejudice, both of which are juvenile
and self-defeating sentiments.
They are a factual depiction of specific people
in specific positions advocating specific policies and stonewalling specific
attempts to elicit specific information about specific lies,
misrepresentations and deceit.
AIPAC and company are riding a tiger in America, and if they ever slip, the
resulting convulsion will be catastrophic for them and for Israel. The open
unfolding of the 9/11 tragedy and its ensuing wars that is now occurring can
be that slip.
The human cost to America to date is some 60,000
people, military and civilian, killed or wounded on 9/11 and in Iraq and
Afghanistan together, with more to come once we go to war with Iran (or get
dragged into it following an Israeli attack on Iran).
Much of the deliberately misdirected rage that
followed 9/11 has given way to endurance and grief, captured all too well in
the following picture of a military funeral here:
But grief is a close cousin to rage, and an
enraged America is not pretty, as anyone familiar with our history can
appreciate.
Americans are often deceptive without meaning to be. To much of
the world, they often come across as naive, bumbling innocents in the world
of global politics. And on a day-to-day basis, there is much truth to that.
But an enraged America is a very different character. You have only to look
at what happened in WWII to German and Japanese cities, towns and villages,
where America slaughtered literally millions of German and Japanese
civilians - most of them women and children - knew it was doing it, and
cared nothing at all.
The goal was to crush, and restraint was not a word
used much at all.
If these Americans and those like them ever fully understand just how much
of their suffering - and the suffering we have inflicted on others - is
properly laid on the doorsteps of Israel and its advocates in America, they
will sweep aside those in politics, the press and the pulpits alike whose
lies and disloyalty brought this about and concealed it from them.
They may well leave Israel looking like Carthage
after the Romans finished with it.
It will be Israels own great fault.
