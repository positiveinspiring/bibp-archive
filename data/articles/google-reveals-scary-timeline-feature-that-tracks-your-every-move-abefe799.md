Google has come under fire for a controversial new service that reveals just how much it knows about you, and the places you go throughout your day.
Called 'Your Timeline,' the service is designed to allow users of Google online maps to see the places they frequent most often. Google's premise for the service is to 'help' people easily remember restaurants and other places which theyve previously visited.
Although you must opt-in to allow Google to store your location history, critics and privacy activists are freaked by Google's ability to track you everywhere you go.
