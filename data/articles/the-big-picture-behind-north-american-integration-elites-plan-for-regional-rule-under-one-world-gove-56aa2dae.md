In 1954,
the Bilderberg group held its first meeting at the
Hotel de Bilderberg in the Netherlands.
It was during this meeting that the first
discussions of European integration were held. Thanks to BBC radio 4
(listen below),
documents were discovered which detailed what went on inside the extremely
secretive conference.
The host of the BBC radio program reads from the 1954
document, which states,
"Some sort of European Union has long been a
utopian dream, but the conference has agreed that it is now a necessity
of our time."
Since 1954, the European Union has become a
reality.
Will
the global elite continue to divide the world?
Today, the creation of an African Union is underway. As with the European
Union, the African Union is to have a common currency, along with a unified
military.
As
Jerome Corsi reports,
"Advancing the movement toward economic and
political globalism, the African Union is moving down the path of
regional economic integration, with the expected end result of
continental economic and political integration."
"And while the AU is still in a formative state, it's already officially
designated by an emblem, a flag, an anthem, a central bank, and unified
continental military force."
"The goal of the African Central Bank is to create an African Single
Currency. African Union planners are currently calling the African
continental currency the 'Gold Mandela.'"
The creation of regional currencies, and the
removal of "unwanted currencies" is necessary, according to Benn Steil.
Writing in the
Council on Foreign Relations publication,
Foreign Affairs, Steil states that,
"The world needs to abandon unwanted
currencies, replacing them with dollars, euros, and multinational
currencies as yet unborn."
"Countries should abandon monetary
nationalism," says Steil.
Members of the Council on Foreign Relations have
made statements regarding the goals of the Council, which mirror current
agendas of the group.
"The Council on Foreign Relations is the
American Branch of a society which originated in England... (and)
...believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one-world rule
established."
- Carroll Quigley
member of
Council on Foreign Relations, mentor to Bill Clinton
"The main purpose of the Council on Foreign Relations is promoting the
disarmament of U.S. sovereignty and national independence and
submergence into an all powerful, one world government."
- Admiral Chester Ward
former CFR
member and Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Navy
In 1999, the Bilderberg group met in Sintra,
Portugal, where they discussed plans for a new economic world order. Thanks
to Jim Tucker's infiltration of the secretive group, we are able to get an
idea of what was talked about inside the meeting.
Writing in his book,
Bilderberg Diary, Tucker
says,
"Kenneth Clarke, a member of the British
Parliament and former chancellor for the exchequer , had called for a
new 'international financial architecture' at the 1999 meeting of Bilderberg. The world should have three major regional currencies,
Clarke told his Bilderberg colleagues. The first is already on the world
scene: The European Euro.
And Britain will join in the European common
currency, he said. Clarke said he would like to see the pound grow
weaker to facilitate Britain's entry into the common currency... The
next step is toward a second great regional currency in the Western
Hemisphere, Clarke said.
The 'amerijo' will come about by the 'dollarization'
of Latin America."
Tucker continues,
"Bilderberg colleagues agreed that the
emerging regional currencies, which will be identified with no specific
country, will do much to eliminate "nationalism" and the "antiquated
notions of sovereignty."
The elite's plans have changed slightly over the
years, but at their core they remain the same. The "amerijo" discussed by
Bilderberg in 1999 appears to have transformed into the common currency for
North America called
the "Amero," as coined by
Herbert Grubel, and supported
by Robert Pastor.
Steve Previs spoke of the Amero and its far reaching implications for
Canada, Mexico and the United States on CNBC.
Watch the clip below:
CNBC Interview with Stephen Previs about the Amero
The proposed North American Union has not been
popular among informed Americans and Canadians.
This has not gone un-noticed
to the elite. As reported here last week (see below report), a conference was held in 2002
during which recommendations were given by CFR members on how to best
propagandize Americans into a "North American Consciousness."
The ultimate goal?
In 1973 the
Club of Rome issued a report titled the "Regionalized and
Adaptive Model of the Global World System." In this report a map is shown
which divides the world into 10 political/economic regions.
Will the North American Union fall in line with the elite's ultimate goal?
Only time will tell.
Until then,
there is still time to resist.
Globalist Think Tank seeks "North American
Consciousness"
Panelists See America as The "Greatest Obstacle" to
"North American Integration"

"This is how we will create a North
American consciousness and a true North American Community. It will
be forged in the heat of conflict, not through a rational
discussion, as painful as that may be. It really cannot happen any
other way."
- Bruce Stokes
CFR Senior Fellow, speaking at the
"Toward a North American Community?" conference, June 11, 2002
In reading a little noticed June 11, 2002
document etailing a conference held by the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars,
shocking revelations are made regarding the elite's plans to create a North
American Union between Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America.
The "Toward a North American Community?" conference focused on the social
and ideological aspects of the creation of a "North American Community", and
prescribes ways to deal with nationalism and a belief in the sovereignty of
ones own country; both obstacles to their plans.
A "North
American Consciousness" - an outlook absent of traditional
beliefs in sovereignty, replaced by an international view favorable to
globalism - is needed, the panelists conclude, that would support the
"...economic, political, and social integration..." of Canada, Mexico, and
the United States.
The title "Toward a North American Community"
may sound familiar to some. This was the title that Robert Pastor, one of
the main proponents of a North American Community, gave to his book that was
published just a year before the Woodrow Wilson conference.
The "Toward a North American Community?" conference is described in the
document,
"This conference was a departure from many
recent events on North America. Instead of looking exclusively at trade
and investment, the panelists were asked to focus on relationships in
North America and to examine identity, sovereignty, and political
practices in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Further economic,
political, and social integration will depend on how citizens of the
three countries define their national identities and the degree to which
they are willing to cede some of their countries sovereignty to a
larger entity."
The document continues, reiterating the same
theme from above,
"The first panel of the conference brought
together scholars from the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Panelists
looked at American, Mexican, and Canadian attitudes on identity and
sovereignty in the context of North America. Trade, political
integration, and the nature of agreements among the three countries will
depend largely on the way people in these countries define their
interests, and the extent to which they feel there is something to be
gained from a North American Community."
Presentations were given by representatives from
Mexico, Canada, and the United States respectively.
The task of each was to present the political
and social atmosphere of each country with respect to "North American
integration."
-
Stephanie R. Golob of Baruch College and
member of the Council on Foreign Relations represented the United
States
-
Alejandro Moreno, director of research
for Reforma, and professor at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de
México represented Mexico
-
Laura Macdonald of Carleton University
represented Canada
Stephanie Golob expressed concerns that
negative American reactions to NAFTA remain a major obstacle to North
American integration.
"...Golob indicated that despite this
perception that the United States is driving integration, related
concerns in the United States about popular sovereignty and national
integrity drove the highly emotional NAFTA debate back in 1993, and
continue to form a key obstacle to North American Community."
Because of this, Golob states that North
American integration will have to come "...from the top down."
Golob's analysis concluded that,
"Many bottom-up linkages such as migration
and the spread of the Spanish language demonstrate community among the
three countries."
Another recommendation given by Golob is that,
"...the President and his inner circle could
fuel its development from the top down by demonstrating to Congress and
the media that the expansion of North American integration is in the
national interest."
It appears that the President has not followed
this strategy just yet, as secrecy still surrounds NAU plans. Outright
denial of plans for a North American Union have come from the White House
press secretary, Tony Snow. He was asked by World Net Daily
about the Security and Prosperity Partnership and the progress towards a
North American Union. Snow flatly denied any involvement.
As
World Net Daily reports,
"WND asked Snow about the criticism,
stating, 'As WorldNetDaily's lead story pointed out yesterday, critics
are expressing concerns about the president's cooperative efforts with
Mexico and Canada regarding the Security and Prosperity Partnership. And
my question: Will the president categorically deny any interest in
building a European Union-style superstate in North America?'"
Responded Snow:
"Of course, no. We're not interested. There
is not going to be an EU in the U.S."
The document elaborates on Golob's proposal
stating that her research showed that forming a "North American identity"
from a "foreign policy perspective" may aid in the shaping of public
opinion.
According to Golob, redefining the word "we"
would also help in the formation of a North American identity.
"Foreign policy, she asserted, provides
three things for a nations citizens: sovereignty, security, and
identity. Sovereignty dictates that the states citizens and government
(we) decide policy, identity defines who we are as a nation, and
security protects a nations sovereignty and identity. Governments must
convince citizens that the regional project is consistent with these
three values by expanding the definition of the we.'
The document continues, describing Golob's
findings on America's stance with regards to a North American Community.
"Golob suggested that the United States,
ironically, may prove the greatest obstacle to this process."
Golob is correct in viewing America as an
obstacle to a North American Union.
While there remains a large section of the
population that is oblivious of its existence, there is an aware and
motivated group of Americans that is. Lou Dobbs, who has been the
only prominent mainstream media figure to raise awareness of the North
American Union,
conducted a poll in early 2007 asking
viewers if they would support legislation to prohibit the creation of a
North American Union.
82% of respondents stated that "Yes" they would
support efforts to stop the NAU.
Golob's proposal goes further, suggesting that
North American integration should be framed in a "non-threatening" manner by
binding in the public's mind the protection of U.S. industries and North
American integration.
Also discussed is the possibility of creating
the false perception that the people are demanding integration.
"She suggested, however, that future
decisions on greater integration would most likely come about via
'integration through protectionism,' where agreements to integrate the
three countries further are coupled with measures that protect specific
U.S. industries.
This would be an incremental approach to
integration in which North American identity is deepened in sectors
already integrating and is framed as non-threatening to those sectors
which see themselves outside of regional flows. This approach would be
driven by Congress and require the building of constituencies so that
the issue could be framed as a 'winner at the polls.'"
The document also contains a transcript of a
speech that Bruce Stokes gave at the conference. Stokes is a Council on
Foreign Relations Senior Fellow, commentator for National Public Radio, and
writer for the National Journal.
Stokes states that,
"...we can agree that people are not at the
point of believing in a North American Community yet. They still think
and act as three separate entities. But they engage in their daily lives
in new and different ways in issues that are really North American
issues. Our challenge, as people that view the North American Community,
is that we need to find issues that people are engaged inwhether they
are trivial or dangerously provocative and use them to move toward a
broader North American consciousness."
The president of the Council on Foreign
Relations, Richard Haass, focused on one such provocative issue
in his article "State
sovereignty must be altered in globalized era."
Among other issues, Haass states that climate
change, or global warming, should give an incentive to cede sovereignty,
"...to world bodies..." He states that,
"Globalization thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker
in reality, but that it needs to become weaker. States would be wise to
weaken sovereignty in order to protect themselves..."
Stokes concludes his speech by saying that,
"This is how we will create a North American
consciousness and a true North American Community. It will be forged in
the heat of conflict, not through a rational discussion, as painful as
that may be. It really cannot happen any other way."
The American people, as well as our neighbors to
the north and south, have been totally alienated as the North American Union
marches forward. The "Toward a North American Community?" conference
panelists do want to include you in the integration process - but apparently
only to manipulate you.
A casual observation of the actions of the
individuals and organizations involved in the creation of the North American
Union seems to show that the predominant strategy in recent years has been
to shun the public.
This chosen path of secrecy may be in response
to the findings of the Woodrow Wilson conference that,
"...people are not at the point of believing
in a North American Community yet."
In the event the NAU becomes much more open to
the public - perhaps due to the exposure of the plans thanks to individuals
like
Jerome R. Corsi, Dr.
Daneen G. Peterson and others - we may in
fact see the strategies outlined during this 2002 conference put to use.

information
Globalist organizations such as the
Council on Foreign Relations and the
Trilateral Commission have a structure that serves to maximize
their influence and effectiveness. Members in the Corporate, Academic, and
Political realms work towards a common goal.
As Patrick Wood of the August Review
writes,
"The global elite march in three essential
columns: Corporate, Political and Academic. For the sake of clarity,
these names will be used herein to refer to these three groups.
In general, the goals for globalism are created by Corporate. Academic
then provides studies and white papers that justify Corporate's goals.
Political sells Academic's arguments to the public and if necessary,
changes laws to accommodate and facilitate Corporate in getting what it
wants."
While Robert Pastor has been given the
majority of media attention, other individuals in the Academic realm from
across the country have written papers regarding North American integration.
The following is a list of several papers written by these individuals.
