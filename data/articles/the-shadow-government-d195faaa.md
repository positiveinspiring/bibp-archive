It is becoming increasingly apparent to American
citizens that government is no longer being conducted in accordance with the
U.S. Constitution, or, within states, according to state constitutions.
While people have recognized for more than 150
years that the rich and powerful often corrupt individual officials, or
exert undue influence to get legislation passed that favors their interests,
most Americans still cling to the naive belief that such corruption is
exceptional, and that most of the institutions of society, the courts, the
press, and law enforcement agencies, still largely comply with the
Constitution and the law in important matters.
They expect that these corrupting forces are
disunited and in competition with one another, so that they tend to balance
one another.
Mounting evidence makes it clear that the situation is far worse than most
people think, that during the last several decades the U.S. Constitution has
been effectively overthrown, and that it is now observed only as a faï¿½ade
to deceive and placate the masses.
What has replaced it is what many call
the Shadow Government. It still, for the
most part, operates in secret, because its control is not secure.
The exposure of this regime and its operations
must now become a primary duty of citizens who still believe in the Rule of
Law and in the freedoms which this country is supposed to represent.(1)
Transition to
Oligarchy
It is difficult to identify a single date or event that marks the overthrow,
but we can identify some critical steps.
-
The first was the Dick Act of 1903,
which repealed the Militia Act of 1792 and tried to relegate the
Constitutional Militia to the National Guard, under control of what
is now the U.S. Defense Department.
-
The second was the Federal Reserve Act,
which established a central bank only nominally under the control of
the government.
Further erosion of constitutional governance was motivated by
several challenges which the powerful felt required them to put
aside their differences and unite.
-
The first was the Great Depression
of 1933-1941
-
The second was World War II and the
threat from fascism
-
Followed by the Cold War and the
threat from Soviet imperialism and from communism
-
The third defies credibility, but cannot
be avoided.
UFOs and
aliens. Despite the 'lack of hard
evidence' accessible to ordinary citizens, there is enough
testimonial evidence to compel a reasonable person to conclude three
things:
UFOs exist, they are intelligently
directed, and they are not ours.(2)
Even if that were all that the
government knew about them, minds already paranoid from the Cold War
could hardly help but perceive such things as a significant
potential threat, one that required secrecy, preparation, and
disregard for provisions of a Constitution that were inconvenient.
There are, however, enough leaks from
government officials to indicate that the government knows a great
deal about them that it is concealing from the public.
-
The fourth is the eco-crisis, which
combines both the ecological and economic crises.
Many leaders have recognized for a long
time that we are headed for disaster, not a kind of cyclical
downturn like the Great Depression, but an irreversible decline
brought about by a combination of,
...playing out in an anarchic
international system of,
...exacerbated by,
Confronted with the political fact that to deal
with the problems faced in the last half of the 20th century, it
was difficult enough to pass legislation thought to be needed, without
having to also adopt the amendments to the U.S. Constitution necessary to
make such legislation constitutional, it became too easy to just adopt more
and more legislation without worrying about its constitutionality, and
depend on compliant officials and judges to go along with it, which for the
most part, they have done.
This was facilitated by the lack of sufficiently
strong protests from the people, many of whom, ignorant of constitutional
rights and limitations on governmental powers, and focused on the problems
to be solved, supported much of the legislation.(4)
We can also identify several insidious developments which seemed necessary
and harmless at the time, but which led to the present situation.
One was the rise of military and civilian
intelligence organs during World War II. The need to prevent leaks of
military secrets brought a censorship apparatus that gained substantial
control over the flow of information through the press, the broadcast media,
telephonic and telegraphic communications, and the mail.
However, instead of dismantling that apparatus
when the war was over, we immediately transitioned to the Cold War, and the
information control apparatus only went underground and became somewhat less
obtrusive.
This led to the present situation in which the
intelligence apparatus maintains effective control over the major media, can
tap anyone's phone without a court order, reads people's mail, monitors
their finances, and gathers information on citizens and their activities
that threatens their privacy and liberties.
1947 was a critical year. It was the year in which UFOs became a matter of
public concern, and in which it appears we recovered at least one crashed
vehicle and perhaps at least one of its occupants.
It is also the year that the
Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) was established, ostensibly to bring
together the disparate intelligence agencies that had often been operating
at cross-purposes.
It was also the beginning of the use of "black
budgets" for government programs, the existence of which was kept secret
from both the public and most if not all members of Congress. This led later
to the establishment of more agencies, such as the National Security Agency,
whose entire budget was black, thus preventing effective oversight.
The situation had evolved to the extent that, at the end of President
Eisenhower's second term,
he warned in a speech of the potential
danger to our freedoms from a "military-industrial complex".
In fact, by that time, it had become a
"intelligence- military-industrial-financial-political-media- criminal"
complex, which reached into almost every institution in this country, and
into many around the world.
What had developed was beginning to look more and more like the system of
political control that prevailed in the Soviet Union, in which real
decisions of government were made not by the official organs of government,
but by the parallel structure of the Communist Party, backed by the KGB. In
competing with the Soviets, we had taken on their methods and attributes of
political control.
But this apparatus did not seem to function as an effective Shadow
Government, able to make and enforce decisions apart from the official
government, until it came together to assassinate President
John F. Kennedy.
That was the watershed event. After that, too
many people had too much to hide to allow the situation to return to
governance as usual.
Since then, the Shadow Government has grown and tried to strengthen its grip
on every sector of the society, motivated in part by honest concern about
the very real threats we have faced, and in part by venality and greed,
which brought increasing corruption and the effective incorporation of
organized crime into the mainstream of government.
It appears that 1963 is also the year in which the Establishment Media
sector of the Shadow Government was given effective control over
computerized voting in the United States, through its National Election
Service, as part of a deal in which they went along with the cover-up of the
Kennedy Assassination through the Warren Commission.
While campaign money continued to buy influence
over elected officials, if it was not sufficient, the Shadow Government had
other options. It put officials in compromising situations, then used its
evidence to blackmail them into compliance.
Failing that, it could easily select the winner
of any election, and suppress the support which third-party candidates might
attain.
Structure and
Decision-making
A key question about the Shadow Government is how does it make decisions and
carry them out.
Where is the center? Some think it lies in a few
major financial institutions. Others that it lies in the intelligence
apparatus. Still others that it has no permanent center, but operates by
consensus, with shifting factions that confer through various mechanisms.
Some think that those mechanisms are reflected
in public associations such as,
That the key personalities in every major
institution should associate and confer through various associations is not
in itself a matter of concern, if all that was involved was the development
of a consensus.
But there is evidence that a centralized
decision-making process exists, because too much is done that could not
otherwise occur, and that the process is contemptuous of the Constitution
and increasingly willing to violate it.
That suggests a permanent apparatus, a
bureaucracy, and that points to the intelligence and financial
bureaucracies. Therefore, the real decisions may be made not by public
figures, but by faceless persons operating in secret.
Most available evidence indicates that the center is in the intelligence
apparatus, and that it largely controls all the other components of the
system, including the financial.
However, it also appears that the control is
imperfect, subject to resistance if it tries to go too far.
It also appears that there are some distinct factions involved, the two
major contenders being those more highly motivated persons concerned about
meeting the challenges we face, the other being the more corrupt ones trying
to expand their power and wealth.
The alliance between these factions appears to
be increasingly strained as growing corruption begins to impair the
effectiveness of the institutions of society to meet the perceived
challenges.
An analogy might be to a sinking ship, in which some want to build and equip
lifeboats and others who want to make sure they are the ones who get to go
in them. Each needs the other, for the time being, but the latter are
beginning to threaten the production and seaworthiness of the lifeboats.
What we have is in many ways a classic oligarchy, with multiple components
in an uneasy alliance with one another. No one individual is paramount, and
anyone can be replaced if he gets too far out of line, by some combination
of the others, each of whom derives his power from the institutions and
assets under his influence.
Of course, the ones who get trampled under this regime are the ordinary
people, who receive just enough under the deal to keep them quiet.
The
Powers That Be fear above all that the people might rise up and
overthrow them, something that the people could still do if they could ever
act in concert. Social control therefore becomes a matter of keeping them
placated, divided, and misinformed.
Unfortunately for their scheme, they face the same problem the Roman Empire
did.
To keep the people placated, they are forced
to pay them off, and meet increasing demands for such payoffs, while
growth of the productive sector falters, or even shrinks relative to the
population.
Economic growth and the solutions to our social
problems are being impaired by the depredations of the corrupt elements of
the Shadow Government, who are concentrating assets in a way and at a rate
that threaten the viability of the economy.
The Romans solved the problem of keeping their
citizens supplied with bread and circuses by predation of outlying
provinces. Modern capitalist nations tried the same thing, but that imperial
order is breaking down, and the only thing left is economic growth.
If that growth falters, the welfare state fails,
and with it the social stability on which the Established Order depends.
Shadow Finance
Some of the best indications that the Shadow Government is not centered in
the financial sector are the things it has to do to finance itself. Shadow
Government is expensive.
We can identify the main sources of its revenue:
-
Black budgets. This is the core of
its operations, but is not enough to secure its control over the
country and the world.
-
Drug trade. It has seized control of the major part of
the illegal traffic in addictive substances, in part by using the
organs of law enforcement to eliminate competition, and by gaining
control of the money and the ways it gets re-introduced into the
economy.
-
Raiding financial institutions.
This is what was done with the S&Ls, and is being done, more slowly,
with the banks. It involves several aspects: diversion of the funds,
seizure of smaller institutions by a few large ones under Shadow
Government control, with the seizure financed by the taxpayers, and
acquisition under distressed prices of the assets of those
institutions, many of which are well-positioned business enterprises
that give the Shadow Government both control of the key enterprises
in most business sectors and sources of revenue. The Savings & Loan
raid was used to finance a major expansion of the Shadow Government.
However, it is not a method that can be repeated.
-
Public authorities. These are
quasi-governmental enterprises that control substantial assets,
often taxpayer-subsidized, without effective accountability.
They include,
To this might also be added various
utilities, and both public and publicly-regulated private
monopolies, like local telephone and cable companies. They are also
a major source of government contracts.
-
Government contracts. Major source of
diverted funds, but must often be shared with others involved.
-
Arms trade. Another major source of
funds, both direct and diverted. But requires payoffs to local
officials.
Shadow Control
The problem with secret government is that to remain secret, it cannot
involve too many people who are aware of the situation.
The more that become involved, the greater the
chance that some of them who retain some sense of honor might defect. An
occasional defector can be disabled, killed or discredited, but a flood of
them could be disastrous. That is what brought down the Bolshevik regime in
the Soviet Union.
Shadow control therefore consists largely of the placement of shadow agents
in key positions in all of the institutions that are to be controlled. Since
they cannot reveal their true role, they are also somewhat constrained in
the actions they can take.
What they do has to fit their jobs and not
conflict in an obvious way with the mission of the organization, even if
they head it.
Some of the main targeted institutions are the
following:
-
Top and key lower positions in the
executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Key judges,
especially presiding judges who assign cases.
-
Staff positions under the top positions,
such as the congressional staff members who really run Congress.
-
Intelligence agencies. The
CIA,(7)
NSA
and various military intelligence divisions. Among their functions
are death squads that eliminate troublesome persons, although they
usually avoid doing that to more prominent ones. They also have
developed mind control techniques that can be used to mess up the
minds of people they want to discredit or disable.(8)
Actually, almost every department of government has an intelligence
function, and that function is the Shadow Government's main point of
control of the department.
-
Military organizations, law enforcement,
and taxing agencies, especially the IRS. Not only federal, but also
state and local, at least in the major cities. The IRS and other
agencies are used to harass persons considered troublesome, and
sometimes to prosecute them on trumped up charges, in which evidence
is planted or manufactured and government witnesses perjure
themselves.
-
Major banks, insurance companies,
pension funds, holding companies, utilities, public authorities,
contractors, manufacturers, distributors, transport firms, security
services, credit reporting services. Forbidden by law from
maintaining dossiers on citizens not the subject of criminal
investigation, the agencies get around the restriction by using
contractors to maintain the data for them, and have amazingly
detailed data on almost everyone. When you hire one of the
major security services, you are turning over the keys to your
premises to the shadow government.
-
Major media. Newspapers, magazines,
television and radio stations. Together, they control the National
Election Service, which in turn controls the outcome of computerized
elections.(9) They suppress coverage of certain subjects,
and are the channel for the Shadow Government's propaganda and
disinformation campaigns. A major part of the budget of the CIA is
for film and video production. They aren't making training films.
-
Communications networks. Telephone, telegraph, cable and
satellite. The Shadow Government can bug any communication they
wish, without bothering with a court order, and they regularly
monitor dissidents and other key figures. Major holes in their
control here are the Internet and public-key encryption, which the
Shadow Government is trying to suppress. Although the Internet can
be monitored, it cannot be effectively controlled, and it is
emerging as a major threat to Shadow control.
-
Organized crime. Despite occasional
convictions, they are now mostly treated as a profit center and as
the executors of the dirty jobs. They are also the providers of
vices for the corrupt members of government, which vices are also
used to blackmail and control people.
-
Education. Universities and public
education. Universities are the least effectively controlled
components, but still important, largely for recruitment. Main aim
here is to divert student activists into unproductive channels, or
to get students so involved in careerism that they ignore the
important issues.
-
Civic, political, and labor
organizations. The two major political parties. Political action
committees. League of Women Voters. Trade and professional
associations, such as the American Bar Association and the American
Medical Association. Labor unions.
-
International organizations.
The United Nations,
NATO, the IMF. Multinational
corporations.
-
Governmental and nongovernmental
institutions of other countries. We are doing many of the same
things there that are being done in the United States, especially in
the more advanced countries.
Concentration of Power
A major aim of Shadow Government control has been to bring most of the
assets and revenues of the economy under the control of fewer and fewer
people.
Part of this is causing the failure of smaller
organizations and the absorption of them by a few large chains. This is
being done with banks and other financial institutions, newspapers and
magazines, television and radio stations, agriculture and mining producers,
distributors and retailers, computer manufacturers, energy and chemical
companies, medical providers, and pharmaceutical companies.
Anti-trust enforcement has been weak, used only
in a few sectors, and then only after major concentrations of economic power
has already been achieved.
The process goes beyond normal tendencies toward monopoly or restraint of
trade, or the economies of scale that support the old adage that "the rich
get richer". It is an attempt to consolidate political control.
The result has been for a smaller and smaller
proportion of the population to control a larger and larger proportion of
the assets and revenues of the economy, while the middle class shrinks.
We are moving away from the original model of
the universal middle class, and toward a third-world model of a small upper
class and a large poor class, with a small middle class that mainly serve as
minions of the rich.
The Shadow Plan
The Shadow Government appears to be operating according to some plan.
Many commentators have dubbed this plan the "New
World Order", suggested by the use of that phrase in a speech by
George Bush, referring to the state of affairs following the
end of the Cold War.
Actually, that phrase goes back to the beginning
of the Republic, and appears on the Great Seal of the United States as the
motto, Novus Ordo Seclorum. What the Shadow Government itself calls the
plan is uncertain, however, some of its elements are now emerging.
One element is the disarming of the people.(10)
There are serious plans and preparations for a
general warrantless sweep of every location in the country to confiscate
weapons. Information about these plans comes from military and intelligence
personnel who are involved in preparing to carry them out. Such an action
would mean seizing more than 300 million firearms from more than 70 million
citizens.
Obviously, after such a sweep there would be so
much public outrage that there could not be another election. Therefore, it
would also be the formal overthrow of the Constitution.
There are indications that after things settled down, the Shadow Government
would allow the establishment of a parliamentary system that would provide a
facade of democracy, just as it does in other countries that have such a
system, without effective limits on the powers of government, where "rights"
endure only as long as there is a sufficiently strong constituency that
defends them.
Such a system is not a republican form of
government, based on the Rule of Law, or a representative democracy, but
merely a tool for control by an oligarchy.
There is also suspicious circumstantial evidence that part of the plan is
the release of diseases, of which HIV/AIDS is one, to reduce the world
population, selectively.
A key part of the plan seems to involve the development and use of
mind control technologies, both electronic and chemical, which
allow the elite to disable or discredit dissidents and keep the people
compliant and productive.
The experimentation that has been done on this
is one of the great cover-ups and abuses of human rights of our time, far
exceeding that of the radiation experiments that are now coming to light.(11)
Restoring
Constitutional Governance
The restoration of constitutional governance need not require a violent
revolution, and we should avoid violence if possible. It can be brought
about in much the way it happened in the Soviet Union.
This involves several elements:
-
Exposure ("glasnost")
The Shadow Government, even more than
the old Soviet regime, depends on secrecy. Uncover it and it loses
most of its power. We need to end black budgets, require the
declassification of most classified documents, especially those
pertaining to UFOs and aliens, and adopt and enforce sunshine laws
to require full disclosure of not just meetings and agreements among
officials, but also among major organizations of all kinds which may
exercise an undue influence on political decisions. We must also
require independent audits of all such organizations.
-
Restructuring ("perestroika")
We need to enforce strengthened
anti-trust laws to break up large enterprises into many competing
firms, not just two or three, and forbid interlocking directorates,
beginning with the broadcast media and the press. Intelligence and
law enforcement agencies need to be broken up into several competing
ones, which can serve as effective checks on abuses by one another.
-
Infiltration and defection
We need to get patriots inside key
organizations and encourage insiders to become patriots. The most
important are military and law enforcement organizations, whose
members must be conditioned to come over to the side of the people
if there is a confrontation. We must also provide effective
protection for whistleblowers.
-
Harassment
Lawsuits. Liens. Freedom of Information
Act requests. Surveillance of principals. Local prosecution of
federal agents.
-
Local organization and publicity
Revive the constitutional Militia on the
Swiss model,(12) set up independent investigation teams,
alternative newspapers, talk radio, alert networks. We need to
inform the public on what is happening, and to reach those who now
are all too willing to trust the government to protect them.
-
Civil disobedience and nonviolent
resistance
Protest demonstrations. Tax protests.
Defiance of unconstitutional laws. Refusal of juries to convict.(13)
-
Armed resistance
This must involve non-provocative, but
firm, defense of persons from illegal abuses, and exclusion of
illegal governmental actions from local areas, county by county,
state by state, with insistence on constitutional compliance.
-
Transition plan
The oligarchy cannot be expected to come
up with a plan for an orderly return to constitutional governance.
The process must be conducted carefully, to avoid a disastrous
collapse.(14) We will need some constitutional
amendments, to make legal some of the things the national government
can do best. The government needs to end budget deficits and acquire
the stock of the Federal Reserve.(15)
Conclusion
The myth is that World War II ended with the defeat of fascism, but what
really happened is that fascism got a grip on those fighting it, and is
becoming increasingly pervasive and powerful.
As it grows, it will induce a reaction, the
outcome of which will be a final confrontation.
We can all hope that the confrontation will not
be a bloody one, and that it will be resolved while we still have time to
solve our other pressing problems.
