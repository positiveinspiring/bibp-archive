Based on
Hyperdimensional Physics, Hoagland successfully predicted the
historic results of this election almost two years ago!
In this production,
based on further application of this HD Model, Hoagland now presents
never-before-seen clues to what America and the world may expect from this
incoming, unique "Hyperdimensional Obama Administration" - including, what
Barack Obama may finally do with NASA's decades of classified data on
intelligent artifacts discovered on the Moon and Mars, as well as what could
be in store for all of us at the end of Obama's first term ... in "2012."
