In an effort to explain our escalating financial crisis, an American
Nightmare (an Environmental Dream), the pundits are focusing their angst on
the 44th POTUS, who might very well go down as the single most inept
president in all of American history. (How
to Squander the Presidency in One Year, David Michael Green)
The decision to have Obama preside over the
greatest financial calamity since the Great Depression was made five years
ago.
Barack Obama is not inept, greedy or stupid and he isnt one of us.
He rose from obscurity to power with his top economics adviser,
Zbigniew Brzezinski, the co-founder of
David Rockefellers
Trilateral Commission and he travels in the same circles as other
members of the super-secret
Skull & Bones Society at Yale University,
who pretend to be running for president every four years.
The decision to have
Obama preside over the greatest financial calamity since the Great
Depression
was made five years
ago; the November election was a formality.
(Why
Joseph Biden will be the Next Vice President of the United States)
To believe otherwise, is to ignore the Bradley/Palin
effect and the decision by John McCain to wait until his concession speech
to shed the image of a nasty grumpy old man.
In September 2008, when the Obama campaign seemed to be slumping and their
candidates long-standing lead in the polls had evaporated, the senators
supporters openly worried that a potential victory might be slipping away.
Then, providence joined the campaign: the failure of the giant investment
bank Lehman Brothers followed by a global financial meltdown in the month of
October.
And, speaking of change, escalating the war in Afghanistan and Iraq and
his policies on Guantanamo, state secrets, renditions, executive power,
bail-outs and the stimulus packages are for the most part identical to those
of
George W. Bush.
However, the policies at the
Federal Reserve have changed
inexplicably, monumentally and
historically:
As of October 2008, the men behind the
Federal Reserve, all connected to the
House of Rothschild, are no longer
giving up whats left of their real wealth so the middle class can live
the American Dream, a nightmare for the planet.
Brian Deese, special assistant to
president Obama for economic policy, in his first government position,
shuffles back and forth from the West Wing to the Treasury Department
rewriting the rules of American capitalism as he dismantles the US
Housing, Automobile Industry and the American Dream. (The 31-Year-Old in
Charge of Dismantling G.M., David E. Sanger)
Deeses First Rule: Withdraw Credit and Liquidity:
Causing spending to fall even further,
forcing companies to cut back on inventory and staff Creating even
more unemployment
263,000 jobs eliminated bringing the total to 39
million Americans who are no longer working or looking for work. (The
September Employment Rate is 90%)
And thats before the recently announced
planned three-year budget freeze on government discretionary spending.
The Federal Reserve Act of
1913
One of the most important domestic acts in the nations history took the
power to create money from the people and gave it to the robber barons of
our filtered history books in theory for profit.
The Federal Reserve was instrumental in the development of America into a
world power.
The United States, in its first decades, was a land of small farms and
nearby towns with few cities of any consequence. The young nation seemed far
more interested in becoming a successful experiment in democracy, rather
than an economic power.
A central bank, necessary for a consumer society, large cities, a common
medium of exchange, and a mechanism to regulate that medium were greeted
with hostility, since many of the nations leaders disdained the urban life.
Anyone who spoke against the Creature
from Jekyll Island by G. Edward Griffin was silenced.
Presidents Garfield and McKinley, outspoken champions of sound money and
opponents of a central bank, were suspiciously silenced permanently.
The conflict between rural values and urban reality ended when Woodrow
Wilson unwittingly ruined his country and signed into law the legislation
that put the growth of the nation... and all our activities in the hands of
a few scoundrels (men).
Once those scoundrels got control of the
supply of money in the Franklin Roosevelt Administration, they began to
buy government securities at the rate of ten million dollars a week for
10 weeks, and created one hundred million dollars in new (checkbook)
currency, which alleviated the critical famine of money and credit, and
the factories started hiring people again.
(Secrets of the Federal Reserve, Eustace
Mullins)
Now those scoundrels remain in control of the
supply of money in the
Barack Obama Administration, they are
making generous interest payments to the banks for parking their TARP and
other government taxpayer bailout money, which is aggravating the critical
famine of money and credit, and the factories started laying people off
(263,000 people in September bringing the total to 39 million Americans who
are no longer working or looking for work).
One of the more absurd notions that found its
way into the history books and the writings of economic experts, is that
somehow these Robinhood barons (swindlers and scoundrels of history) were
made wealthier by manipulating the Monopoly money they created out of thin
air used to alleviated the critical famine of money and credit so the
factories could start hiring people again and finance our consumer society.
In 1910, the men behind the Federal Reserve Rockefeller, Kuhn, Loeb and
Morgan, all connected to the Rothschilds global financial empire, owned or
controlled one-sixth of the worlds real wealth - gold, silver and raw
materials - not the fiat currency we call money.
And their real wealth, where is it now?
Used up, as in consumed, by the middle class so former members of the Third
Estate (serfs and slaves) could have houses, cars, RVs, TVs and DVDs - the
affordable things we take for granted which put the planet, according to the
GEO4, a massive United Nations Report, at the unknown points of no return.
(Liberté,
Egalité, Fraternité - Providence, Miracle or What Really Happened)
The swindlers and scoundrels wealth, not yours or mine, was eventually
cut, mined and hauled away, so that Americans could trash the planet
with that cheap stuff until October 2008.
Money control, Gustav Stolper wrote in This
Age of Fables is, the supreme and most comprehensive of all
governmental controls" and the 1838 quote:
Permit me to issue and control the money of
a nation, and I care not who makes its laws.
(Incorrectly attributed to Mayer Amschel
Rothschild who died in 1812).
Reflects the maxim of the House of Rothschild.
However, money lenders of the Old World cannot be talking about profits
unless you believe
The Rothschilds didnt understand that they
were about to give up $500 trillion of real wealth in exchange for $500
trillion pieces of worthless fiat currency.
During the last 100 years, those swindlers and scoundrels were able to
distort the structure of relative prices; generate misallocations of labor
and capital throughout the economy; rationalize new governmental
interventions in the face of the market instability manipulate the
patterns of and the profits from international trade which resulted in the
Industrial Revolution, the Great Depression, the stagflation of the 1970s,
the dot-com and the housing market bubbles and unprecedented prosperity for
the middle class.
Would we have a financial crisis to go with our environmental crisis if
Wilson hadnt ruined the country when he gave away the peoples right to
print their own money and we had our own bank?
No.
North Dakota is the only state in the union to own its own bank. The Bank
of North Dakota (BND) was established by the state legislature in 1919
specifically to free farmers and small businessmen from the clutches of
out-of-state bankers and railroad men.
The state of North Dakota, one of only two states (along with Montana)
expected to meet its budget in 2010.
North Dakota was also the only state to actually
gain jobs in 2009 while other states were losing them. Since 2000, North
Dakotas GNP has grown 56 percent, personal income has grown 43 percent and
wages have grown 34 percent. North Dakota in 2009, had a budget surplus of
$1.3 billion, the largest it ever had - in a state with a population of
700,000. (The
North Dakota Model for Capitalizing Community Banks, Ellen Brown)
North Dakota, a land of small farms and
towns more interested in remaining a successful experiment in democracy
rather than an economic power.
At this point, it is advantageous to consider the efforts of writer Andrew
Hitchcock:
The Rothschilds have been in control of the
world for a very long time, their tentacles reaching into many aspects
of our daily lives, and are the hidden hand behind all the social
cataclysms in history: The French and American Revolution, the Civil
War, World Wars, the Industrial Revolution, the Federal Reserve (and our
consumer society).
John Sherman, a Rothschild protégé in a
letter sent to New York bankers on June 25, 1863 in support of the then
proposed National Banking Act, wrote:
The few who understand the system, will
either be so interested in its profits, or so dependent on its favors
that there will be no opposition from that class, while on the other
hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending the
tremendous advantages
will bear its burden without complaint, and
perhaps without suspecting that the system is inimical to their best
interests.
(World
War II And Pound, 1940-1945: The Anti-Semite Revealed, Ellen
Cardona)
In other words, the few that understand the
system, without a 20th century environmental perspective of the middle
class trashing the planet, would not be capable of comprehending a system
that would put the planet at the unknown points of no return because the
environmental damage and pollution was the goal and not the unintended
consequences of the Industrial Revolution and our consumer society.
The Federal Reserve isnt evil because they print our money and make us pay
interest on it; they are evil because they are in a metaphysical war with
mother-earth (Gaea).
October 2008 marked the last day the lender of last resort would give up
whats left of their real wealth, used to con us into shopping for useless
toxic stuff, to weaken their opponent, mother-earth. (Ominous
