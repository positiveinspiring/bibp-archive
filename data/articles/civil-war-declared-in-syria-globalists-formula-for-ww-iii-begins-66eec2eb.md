The Syrian opposition is doing a fine job as
directed by the CIA.
The connection between these rebels and the US
government is uncanny. Mainstream media has downplayed the Western
intervention into the Syrian conflict, referring to them as pro-democracy
campaigners without admitting their political agendas or ties.
The same champions of former President G.W. Bushs invasion of Iraq are
cheering on the sidelines, waiting for Obamas unconstitutional declaration
of war in Syria.
Speaking for the Syrian National Council (SNC) is Bassma Kodmani, who was an
attendee at
the Bilderberg Meeting this year in Chantilly, Virginia. The SNC
have had the closest contact to Obamas administration and called
specifically for US forces to militarily strike Syria early on in the
conflict.
Kodmani has declared :
No dialogue with the ruling regime is possible. We
can only discuss how to move on to a different political system.
She also
has stated :
The next step needs to be a resolution under Chapter VII,
which allows for the use of all legitimate means, coercive means, embargo on
arms, as well as the use of force to oblige the regime to comply.
The NATO forces or armed peacekeepers have been waiting in the wings for
their direction to attack.
Over 10,000 men armed with highly-sophisticated weapons, including
anti-tank missiles entered into Syria to assist in the conflict and
bloodshed. These trained terrorists took up positions in the suburban areas
while other armed groups attacked Assads military.
In Turkey, while the CIA trains oppositional forces against Assad, there has
developed an element of instability within the Kurds against Erdogan, who
supports the CIA operatives.
Through Palestinian Intelligence sources, Turkey provided evidence that
Erdogan had direct involvement in the Gaza Flotilla killings. These murders
aided the Turkish Muslim Brotherhood who was opposed to military action
against Syria.
Could the same forces who have orchestrated uprisings in the Middle East as
so-called Arab Springs be planning another in Turkey?
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) has admitted involvement with the Arab Reform Initiative (ARI) and the US/Middle East Project that is a
consortium of senior diplomats, intelligence officers and financiers that
are directed to control regional policy analysis to ensure conflict while
purporting stability.
To finance the forced regime change in Syria, the CFR have employed the
Centre for European Reform (CER), while using advise from Peter Sutherland
from Goldman Sachs.
Advisers to the project include:
-
Brent Scowcroft, former US National Security adviser
-
Zbigniew Brzezinski, influential to Obamas rise to presidency
-
George Soros, providing monies from his Open Society Foundation
-
Charles Grant, former defense editor of the Economist
Now the Red Cross has declared that civil war is officially sited as Homs
and Hama are noted as war zones.
This means that combatants are subject to
the Geneva Conventions and possibly be tried as war criminals in
international court.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is beginning talks with Russia and China in
an attempt to coerce them into supporting the pending military strike
against Syria.
are gathering up forces and making
ready for the war they have been planning on for quite some time.
The UN has been frustrated with Russias continued blockade of resolutions
with the ultimate intervention of UN NATO forces against Assad.
An anonymous
diplomat admits:
the problem here is Russia.
By declaring civil war in Syria, Assad could, and most likely will, be
charged and tried for war crimes.
Mohamad Bazzi, adjunct for the CFR,
remarked:
Most of the scenarios are really frightening and just lead to
more brutality by the regime and more of a counterattack by the opposition.
The regime still hasnt been weakened to the degree where they can be
overrun.
Bazzi claims the declaration of civil war will do little to change the
situation.
The regime already opened themselves up to that months ago, and
theyve been rather disdainful of any kind of international accountability
for what theyve done.
On the whole, the observer mission has not been
particularly successful. Its something for the UN to focus on but its sort
of a sideshow.
As the UN Security Council voices concerns that Russia will come to Assads
defense if and when military strike occurs, the UN has stated that,
we
really need to decide if we are prepared to take action... We should be
supporting the opposition, with weapons, ammunition, training and
intelligence - now.
