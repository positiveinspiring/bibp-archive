NewOrleans.IndyMedia Website
In August of 2004, quietly and without fanfare,
an article was published on the Los Angeles Independent Media website
revealing a plan by the U.S. government to depopulate the country via the
water system.
The article alleged that the water system had
been reconfigured country-wide so as to function as a finely honed targeting
system, which, when deployed, would selectively target individual homes with
undrinkable, or death water.
The article alleged that this had been
accomplished by the construction of a complex system of double lines and
mixing capabilities on the main lines. In this manner, certain, pre-selected
homes would receive the ordinary water while the targeted homes would
receive the mixture.
It is the contention of this reporter that the mixture
will kill those imbibing the water.
Nearly three years have passed since the publication of Public
Extermination Project. New information has surfaced supporting these claims. In addition, this
reporter has determined some errors in the initial report, which mandate
correcting.
A careful reading of
Section 817 of the Patriot Act, The Expansion of the
Biological Weapons Statute, reveals this to be the umbrella statute which
is authorizing this project. While the wording of this statute is somewhat
opaque, a diligent scrutiny of the language reveals its true intent.
Firstly, this statute is legalizing delivery systems and toxins under
certain circumstances.
The statute details when these delivery systems and toxins will
and will not be legal.
Poisons, as we all know, are meant to terminate, not enhance, life. There is
no mention in 817 of these poisons being utilized as any sort of legally
sanctioned punishment for a crime, such as lethal injection.
Rather, the
statute states that these SHALL be legal when used for purposes determined
as,
peaceful, protective, prophylactic or bona fide research.
Setting aside the research clause, we are essentially seeing the legalizing
of peaceful, protective, prophylactic... poisoning.
We have thus essentially bypassed any necessity for due process and have
authorized the use of poisons to kill.
A dissection of the part of this statute which lists the restricted
persons, who are disallowed from possessing or transporting these delivery
systems and toxins indicates that this statute is not authorizing a military
operation.
The list of restricted persons follows:
"(2) The term 'restricted person' means an individual who,
"(A) is under indictment for a crime punishable by
imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year;
"(B) has been convicted in any court of a crime
punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year;
"(C) is a fugitive from justice;
"(D) is an unlawful user of any controlled
substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled
Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802));
"(E) is an alien illegally or unlawfully in the
United States;
"(F) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or
has been committed to any mental institution;
"(G) is an alien (other than an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence) who is a national of a
country as to which the Secretary of State, pursuant to
section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979
(50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)), section 620A of chapter 1 of
part M of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.
2371), or section 40(d) of chapter 3 of the Arms Export
Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2780(d)), has made a
determination (that remains in effect) that such country
has repeatedly provided support for acts of
international terrorism; or
"(H) has been discharged from the Armed Services of
the United States under dishonorable conditions.
Nowhere is there any mention of exclusive military dominion over these
delivery systems and toxins.
We therefore infer that this is NOT authorizing
the use of poisons in warfare against an enemy of the United States of
America.
So who are the intended recipients of this biological warfare, authorized in
this statute? If not an enemy of this country, could it be selected segments
of the U.S. population?
We have seen in our country, since 911, the stripping of civil rights that
historically accompanies the rise of fascism. Our vote seems to have gone
the way of Diebold, and can now be electronically finessed by those who seek
to cement their continued governing power. Our privacy rights have been
crushed by the national emergency that the attacks of 911 established as
an ongoing national predicament.
Most newspaper editors will acknowledge, at
least in private conversation, that they believe their office phone lines to
be tapped.
Peace groups, and even Quakers, have been under surveillance, and
an act as simple and unremarkable as checking a book out of a library now
may invoke FBI scrutiny of library records, courtesy of the Patriot Act.
The Patriot Act had already been written before the
attacks of 911, and was
waiting in the wings to be trotted out and rammed through Congress. It is
not my intention here to attempt an analysis of who the true perpetrators
were of the 911 attacks.
This has been adequately done by many authors and
researchers, including Webster Tarpley and David Ray Griffin.
What these
redoubtable authors have failed to do is to draw the line of reasoning
between the creation of what Tarpley terms synthetic terror to the war on
Iraq as a position in a global chess game, rather than as an imperialistic
invasion for purpose of seizure of oil resources.
And neither Tarpley,
Griffin, or any other of the 911 researchers that I am aware of have drawn
attention to the implications of 817 as authorizing a mass domestic
extermination project.
While Griffins analogy to the event that kicked off the U.S. involvement in
WWII certainly helps us to understand how governments may either allow or
even initiate certain events in order to make war on other countries, it
fails in the analysis of what has become, through the Patriot Act and the
Military Commissions Act, a war on the citizens of the U.S.
Tarpleys comparison between 911 and the Reichstag fires provides a more
fertile field for comparison. It is a matter of historical fact that Hitler
had his own Brownshirts burn down the German Parliament, then blamed this
destructive act on the Communists.
This provided a bogus national
emergency so as to provide a rationale for the stripping of civil liberties
necessary for his ascension to dictatorship.
As a result of the false state of emergency, Hitler was granted emergency
powers. He ultimately used these enhanced powers to invade Poland, Norway,
the Netherlands, France, Belgium as he headed on towards his mission of
world control, and to launch an extermination policy within his own country.
The mass genociding of the Jews, the gypsies, Communists, Jehovahs
Witnesses, the disabled, homosexuals and political dissidents in Hitlers
Germany has become the modern day standard against which other brutal
dictatorships are now measured.
The process of rights-stripping as a result of the creation of synthetic
terror, as well as our imperialistic invasions of the Middle East strongly
echo Hitlers prototype. Missing is an awareness of a domestic extermination
policy.
It is the contention of this reporter that the Patriot Act has
indeed codified a domestic extermination policy, via delivery systems and
toxins, which has yet to be deployed. 817 appears to be the slam dunk
death clause in the Patriot Act.
And if the Jews are, again, one of the primary targets slated for
extermination, as this reporter believes, then the destruction of Israel
would be a necessary pre-condition for the deployment of the water weapon.
Through our invasion of Iraq, we have secured a base with proximity to
Israel. This will facilitate the bombing and wholesale destruction of the
tiny Jewish state, which our government could then easily blame on Osama bin
Laden, Iran, Hezbollah or whatever most convenient fall guy we choose.
The media has gingerly reported the stripping of rights that followed on the
heels of the 911 attacks. It is now common knowledge that intelligence
agencies can commandeer bookstore records, bug conference rooms and tap
phones with impunity.
It is NOT common knowledge that the government can, at
will and without due process, poison selected U.S. citizens. It is the hope
of this reporter that by adequately documenting the plan to use the water
system as a weapons system that it may be possible to derail what will
otherwise be the worst genocidal attack in the history of the planet.
In order for the water system to be deployed as a selective, finely honed
targeting system, it would be necessary for it to be configured in certain
ways. First of all, there would need to be at least two water lines in most
neighborhoods. One line would provide ordinary water, while the second line
would contain the toxins.
My research on the water system in such disparate
venues as Los Angeles and Spokane has revealed the existence of the double
line system.
I have attached two photographs of blueprints from the Spokane water system
(Attachments 1 & 2). These were obtained April 19, 2007, at a public meeting
held at Applebees Restaurant on 29th Street in Spokane. The work in this
area has significantly disrupted traffic and access to local businesses. The
meetings were held weekly to answer questions of local business owners and
residents.
I identified myself as a Sandpoint based writer and requested of Steve
Sather, project engineer, a viewing of the blueprints. He immediately
complied, and I requested photographing privileges. He assented.
The attached photos, taken that morning, reveal the double line system on
29th Street in Spokane, Washington. This particular project involved the
replacement of two water lines - a twelve inch main and a parallel 36 inch
main.
The onsite foreman, Brian Snipes, who appeared quite uncomfortable
with my request to photograph the prints, informed me that the 36 inch line
was a transmission line, and not to be tapped. However, the blueprints
reveal something pivotal about this system: access line connecting the two
lines, every fifty yards or so.
According to the specs, both lines were
placed 5.5 feet deep. The only reasonable assumption is that the two mains
are connected by the access lines.
Snipes had attempted to refute my perception that the two pipes were, in
fact, connected. He had informed me that the connective pipe was flexible,
and would bend under the second main. The pipe I viewed that day did not, in
fact, appear to be flexible.
In 2006, I submitted more requests for documents to the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power. Specifically, I requested blueprints from the
Ardmore Street Cement Re-lining Project.
The attached letter came back from LADWP, signed by Ronald Deaton, General
Manager (Attachments 3 & 4). He stated that certain sensitive information
would be redacted from the blueprints that would be ponied up to me.
Understanding that I would be viewing altered blueprints, I scheduled a
meeting in March of 2007.
Every print I was given was stamped REDACTED.
However, there were no indications of white-out or black- out on the prints.
Aside from a few scattered indications of hydrant valves, there were no
other valves detailed on the blueprints. There was also virtually no
evidence of service lines from the main(s) to houses or businesses. The
infamous second lines were, in almost every blueprint, also missing.
In the
process of redacting, it appears that LADWP created entirely new documents
for me to view.
I have also attached a recent letter from the City of Santa Monica, in
response to California Public Records Act requests for information about the
water system (Attachments 5 & 6). Santa Monica was one of the cities
initially contacted by this reporter, and the responses to those requests
are contained in the link to the original article.
This letter, signed by Eugenia Jimenez for Assistant City Attorney Joseph
Lawrence, states that my requests for blueprints and for contracts with
private companies are,
highly sensitive and jeopardize the security of the
City.
You may note by re-visiting the Public Extermination Project
article that Joe Lawrence also put his name to a letter in 2004 stating that
there were no records whatsoever on water work in Santa Monica, California.
I have also attached two photographs of blueprints of the Los Angeles water
system (Attachments 7 & 8). Through a bit of studiously disingenuous Irish
blarney, this reporter was able to view and photograph some of the
non-redacted blueprints from the Ardmore Street Project.
I located an ongoing work site, and arrived in the late morning. I had
sidled up to a small group of Creamer employees who were digging up a
section of the street (both Creamer and Spiniello were awarded sections of
the cement re-lining contract). While the crews are buttressing the aging
pipes with cement, they are also replacing the manually operated valves with
remote controlled valves. This is critical to the deployment of this weapons
system.
More about these valves a little later on in this report.
I chatted with the forklift operator for a bit. I told him I was a reporter
covering infrastructure work.
How boring, he commented.
I made a face and
agreed.
We talked a little, and I asked if I could get a gander at the
blueprints. He was agreeable, and asked another crew member to retrieve the
plans from the truck. Immediately, I sat down on the curb and began to
shoot.
Within a few minutes, he realized that I was photographing the blueprints.
He got down off the lift and walked over to me.
Hey, he said uneasily, I
dont know who you are. We are in very strange times. You could be a
terrorist
His voice trailed off.
I smiled at him, as disarmingly as possible, and quickly stuck my cameras in
my pocket.
Oh my goodness, I said. I dont want to worry you. Here, take
back the plans.
And then I winked at him.
Actually, I said, I am Osama
bin Laden. They shrunk me and gave me a sex change, so the CIA could never
find me. Pretty clever, wouldnt you say?
He laughed. The moment of suspicion had passed.
He took the plans back to
the truck, and my cameras remained safe inside my jacket pocket.
Hey, listen to this! he said to his buddies on the crew. Shes Osama!
Everyone had a good laugh. I stayed a few more minutes, chatting amiably
with the guys, then took off, my cameras and photographs secure.
The two attached photos from the Ardmore Street project were taken that day
with a cell phone camera and with a standard camera. The second line is in
evidence in both photos, which delineate separate streets in the Ardmore
Street Cement Re-lining Project.
One of my detractors, Harry Mobley, of Alton, Illinois, has stated that the
existence of two lines is normal.
Mobley writes,
. but second lines are
there already. That's normal. It's a backup to feed around any breaks
when certain lines have to be closed down for repair.
This way, the problem affects the least amount of customers.
If that were in fact true, the city would not need to lay down temporary,
gutter lines while doing this infrastructure work.
As the City of Los
Angeles needs to provide a continuity of water service while working on the
main lines, and if the second lines were indeed, as Mobley stated, only
back-up lines and NOT containing another substance, the temporary gutter
lines in evidence in the following photograph would not be necessary. The
city would simply utilize its back-up line, and would not incur the added
work and expense of laying down gutter pipe.
The attached photograph of
gutter line during a recent cement re-lining project was taken at Washington
Boulevard, in Los Angeles, California (Attachment 9).
The blueprints I photographed in 2006 from the Ardmore Street Project do not
appear to be as complete as the ones I first viewed back in 2004, while the
City was working on the Washington/La Brea area, nor as complete as the
Spokane prints. Engineers, architects and others with access to water
blueprints will affirm that there are layers of work that have been done on
the underground utilities throughout the years, and different sets of
blueprints will reveal varying levels of complexity in delineating the
systems.
The blueprints I first viewed in Los Angeles, courtesy of an
on-site foreman, revealed not only the existence of double lines, but access
lines connecting the two lines at regular intervals. This was also revealed
in the plans from the Spokane system.
The L.A. plans had also revealed crosses in front of every residence on
that street. I had incorrectly designated these as tees in my first
publication on the water weapon. Tees, be they tee fixtures or tee valves,
have three ports. Crosses have four ports. The significance of tees and
crosses in the water system is that three or more ports provide the
possibility to introduce another substance into the primary line.
For purposes of clarification as to the functions of tees, I have attached a
photo of an exposed tee, taken at Casa Las Rosas in Los Angeles, in 2005
(Attachment 10). As you will see, there are three ports, or accesses. As
water cannot flow both East/West and West/East at the same time, two of the
ports provide for the uninterrupted flow of water in one direction.
The
third port would allow for the possibility of an introduction of a substance
from another line into the main line.
A valve would be necessary to control the introduction of a substance from
another source. Without a control valve, the two substances would be freely
intermingling.
My original assumption that tee, or three port valves, were involved in this
system may not be entirely accurate.
Virgil Diaz, who is a sales rep for
Mueller, which has acquired U.S. Pipe, advanced my understanding of this
system by pointing out that gate valves positioned on tee joints serve the
same function as tee, or three port, valves. The same would go for gate
valves on cross joints. The red valve depicted in the second photo on
the
Public Extermination Project article is, in fact, a gate valve, which is a
two port valve.
The first photo depicts a gate valve on a tee joint.
For further clarification, the link that follows provides a quick primer on
valves.
http//www.spiraxsarco.com/learn/modules/6_1_01.asp
The original article had stated that the red valves were manufactured by
Tyton. They are, in fact, manufactured by U.S. Pipe. An overview of the
officers of U.S. Pipe reveals a very compelling history.
Ray Torok,
President of U.S. Pipe, previously spent twenty five years at Alcoa, as Vice
President and General Manager of the Aerospace Division.
Walter Knollenberg,
VP of Finance and Treasurer of U.S. Pipe, previously served as Vice
President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Burns Aerospace
Corporation. Aerospace companies are generally known for their government
contracts, including spy satellites, etc. It would be an unusual career path
from aerospace to plumbing.
Unless, of course, there is a direct connection
between the satellites and the water system.
And apparently there is...
The ROM Communications website provides a diagram
which depicts how remote controlled water valves can be accessed off a
computer, lap top or even cell phone (Attachment 11). As shown in the
diagram, the originating signal goes into the internet and up to a
satellite, which can then relay the signal to the items featured on the left
hand side of the diagram.
Please note the inclusion of the water valve as a
remote asset in the far left of the diagram. I have also attached a photo
of gate valves stacked up in the City Yard in Santa Monica, California
(Attachment 12). You will note the chalked in numbers on the valves on the
bottom row. These appear to be RFID addresses
The ability to control these valves from a remote location is a necessary
component of this system. The system has been configured for a mass
kill - therefore, it would be wildly impractical and ludicrously inefficient
to attempt to dispatch teams of workers throughout the broad sweep of this
country to dig up the streets and manually turn all the valves at the
designated time of deployment.
The valves would need to be solenoid, or
remote controlled. Thus, at the time of deployment, after determination had
been made as to which locations house the targets and which will be passed
over, one would need only throw a switch to open the valves.
And the
twisted vision which compelled Prescott Bush, who was the money man in the
U.S. for Adolph Hitler, would be brought to fruition under the reign of his
grandson, President
George W. Bush.
In a taped interview in March of 2006, Ali Sabouni, the Resident Engineer
for the Ardmore Street Project, stated emphatically that,
There is no such
thing as a remote controlled water valve.
When further questioned as to how
timed sprinkler systems operate, he sputtered, then back-tracked.
Those are
small valves, he said, lamely.
Small valves. What a relief. Then we really have nothing to worry about.
For Ali Sabouni, who is in charge of the Ardmore Street Project, one of
thousands of such projects across the country, Ali Sabouni, who refused to
tell me the country of his birth or where he obtained his Masters Degree in
Engineering, Ali Sabouni tells me that remote controlled sprinkler valves
are small valves.
Im sure glad we cleared that up.
Hitler had his showers. Bush has his water lines...

Public Extermination Project
by Janet C. Phelan
August 14, 2004
from
LA.IndyMedia Website
A specific public works project became "classified" following 911.
This
project, which has been on-going throughout the U.S., has lethal
capabilities for innocent U.S. citizens.
There has been intensive media attention since 911 to the resultant war on
terrorism and our aggression in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The media has,
however, failed to report a shocking post 911 project here in the U.S.
Following 911, there began intensive and concentrated infrastructure work
that has lethal capabilities and intent. In an extremely non-forthcoming
governmental atmosphere, I have been able to document a small portion of
this work, which was ongoing in Los Angeles County in the spring of 2004.
Through the use of t-valves, the government can regulate, on an
individualized, residence by residence basis, the introduction of another
substance into the water lines. As fluoride goes in at the plant, we are not
dealing with the capability to add fluoride. It is quite a bit more
nefarious than that.
In the first interview in May, 2004, with Engineer Mike Downs and Head
Engineer Julie Spacht, Department of Water and Power, downtown Los Angeles
office, the two engineers issued a blanket denial that t-valves were used in
any capacity
by DWP.
Spacht stated that she had never heard of t-valves, and
asked, somewhat disingenuously, whether I could draw one so that she could
see what they looked like.
Several days later, I happened upon surface work by DWP contractor Spiniello
Co. The work involving t-valves is generally done under the street; however,
the surface work on La Brea Avenue between Washington and Venice Blvds.
revealed a t-valve in front of every house.
When I informed Downs that I had the valves on film, it seemed to jog his
memory. When I asked him to state in writing the DWP policy on t-valves, he
submitted a fax (Attachment A) stating that t-valves were never used in
mainline construction (note the capitalization and bold type used for
emphasis).
Photograph 1 is a t-valve on mainline construction on Washington Blvd. and
Harcourt, under the authority of DWP.
According to Spiniello workers, every single t-valve is being replaced by
ones that respond to computer commands. The Spiniello foreman at this job
site revealed that the main computer is in a centralized location.
Photograph 2 features the replacement t-valve. It is manufactured by Tyton.
The picture was taken at the above site, prior to installation.
We must now consider why DWP, through Downs, is misstating fact about
something as seemingly benign as regulatory valves. As a rule of thumb,
there is generally no cover-up unless there is something to hide.
I have secured a sample directly from a DWP water line. It is simply toxic,
causing extreme cardiac discomfort. However, it tastes just like water.
In order to fully understand the implications here, we must comprehend the
larger context. Students of history are aware of the striking similarities
between 911 and the Reichstag fires in Hitler's pre-war Germany. Briefly,
Hitler had his own troops burn down the German Parliament. Hitler then
blamed the fires on the Communists, in order to obtain the powers to govern
under a bogus state of emergency.
911 and the resultant Patriot Act have essentially duplicated the political
situation here in the U.S. The media has dutifully reported the increased
incidence of surveillance, the governmental intrusion into library and
bookstore records, and other losses of civil liberties. However, the media
has failed to explicate that we have also lost the right to life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness. More specifically, the right to life. Ask any
civil rights lawyer. If you can still find one.
The tie in the t-valve project now becomes clear: our government is denying
the capability of making additions into the water system when the work is
ongoing. If the introduction of a toxic substance into the lines were
planned, would they admit it? It might cause a generalized panic.
For those concerned how our own leadership could possibly be involved in
such a questionable matter, one needs to understand the ongoing relationship
between the Bush family and Adolph Hitler.
It has been well documented by Webster Tarpley and
Antonin Chaitkin in the book,
George Bush
- An
Unauthorized Biography, that our Presidents grandfather, Senator
Prescott
Bush, was funneling millions of dollars into Hitler's war effort through
Union Bank Corporation.
In October, 1942, the government seized UBC under
the Trading with the Enemies Act, declaring the bank to be a Nazi front.
Prescott Bush was at that time a director of UBC. For those who are
interested in further documentation of this, I refer you to chapter 2 of the
above cited book.
The Bush-Hitler connection did not end with the seizing of the bank. It
simply became more covert and less easy to detect. It was continued on
through Skull and Bones, the Yale secret society with massive Nazi
connections, into which both Presidents Bush immersed themselves at Yale.
It is important here to understand that using water as a medium for
poisoning had its genesis in the Nazi prison camps, where the first
introduction of the hotly debated compound sodium fluoride was used as a
form of hippocampal dulling.
According to Charles Perkins, who was appointed post-war head of the German
chemical giant I.G. Farben. The real reason behind
water fluoridation is
not to benefit children's teeth.
The real purpose behind water fluoridation
is to reduce the resistance of the masses to domination, control and loss of
liberty.
The German chemists worked out a very ingenious and far-reaching
plan of mass-control which was submitted to and adopted by the German
General Staff. This plan was to control the population in any given area
through mass medication of drinking water supplies.
Repeated doses of
infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individuals power
to resist domination, by slowly poisoning and narcotizing a certain area of
the brain, thus making him submissive to the will of those who wish to
govern him.
His remarks were reinforced by Dr. E.H. Bonner, who was the great Albert
Einstein's nephew:
Even in small quantities sodium fluoride is a deadly
poison to which no effective antidote has ever been found.
For those
wishing a more complete reading on this subject, please reference
The Crime
and Punishment of I.G. Farben, by Joseph Borken.
It is necessary to reiterate here that in the case of the Los Angeles DWP
sample, we are not dealing with fluoride. This report touches on the Nazi
use of fluoride as an example of using the water system for purposes that
were contrary to the welfare of those imbibing the water.
To recap, there are definite similarities between 911 and Hitlers Reichstag
fires.
-
Because of 911, we have lost the right to live.
-
An introduction of another substance into the water lines could prove
deadly.
-
According to Mike Downs, the water records became classified the week
after 911.
-
He is attempting to deceive this reporter by denying that the valve that
simply has the capability to introduce another substance into the water
system is even used by DWP.
-
Add to this galmaufrey the extensive relationship between the Bush family
and Adolph Hitler and his spiritual descendants, and the picture comes into
focus.
Through the use of t-valves, concentration camps become unnecessary.
The
U.S. government now has the capability of exterminating whoever they wish
through its own water system. No muss, no fuss, no heart-wrenching scenes of
rounding people up and transporting them off to a highly uncertain future.
When they are ready for the Big Kill, when they have determined which
residences will receive death water and which will be bypassed (the
function of a t-valve in front of every residence), a switch will be thrown
and what Hitler began will be accomplished.
In this context, the reason for the oops-no-weapons-of-mass-destruction
war in Iraq becomes transparent. We now have a base with proximity to
Israel. When Israel, the refuge established for the Jewish people after the
horrific events perpetrated by Hitler, gets hit and expunged from the
planet, we will face, once again, genocide. This time it will occur in the
flagship for democracy in the world.
Hitler had his showers; Bush has his water lines.
There have been enormous obstacles to obtaining any documentation for this
story.
Within 24 hours of my first request for water records at Santa Monica
City Hall, I was forced to resign from my position as columnist for the
Santa Monica Daily Press.
Nevertheless, I continued on.
The first request produced the letter from Joseph Lawrence, Assistant City Attorney, featured in
attachment B.
A
reading of the Public Records Act indicated that Lawrence was misstating the
PRA in his refusal to give records. In addition, his declaration that there
were no documents responsive to the request is also dubious, in view of the
fact that at that very time there was water line work in progress at the
Santa Monica Pier, two blocks away from Lawrence's office.
My second request produced the letter featured in
attachment C.
This letter
from the Santa Monica City Attorney's office misstated ths substance of my
request. I had requested work orders on t-valves since September 2001, not
in September 2001.
Recognizing that I was getting smoke blown at me, I filed a request with the
City Clerk, Maria Stewart, to address the City Council concerning
misstatements of the PRA and non-responsive communications from the City
Attorney's office.
Ms. Stewart denied my request to be put on the agenda, and offered a slot
under item 14, which requires no response from the City Council.
I then approached the City Manager's office concerning inaccessibility of
appropriate channels to address this matter. That office produced the letter
in attachment D, stating that my request for obtaining the work orders on
t-valves was denied because of homeland security.
Despite the refusal of records, an on-site DWP worker offered to let me view
blueprints he had in his company truck.
A perusal of the blueprints for the Washington-LaBrea area substantiated my
hunch. There was a t-valve demarcated in front of every edifice. The worker
also assured me that in the case of a multi-unit building, there was a
t-valve for each individual unit.
There was also a second line.
In order to make an addition into the water system, a second line would be
necessary.. The worker explained that this line was merely a conduit for
transporting water great distances.
However, there were service lines connecting the second line onto the main
line, as well as to the lines branching off onto the side streets, which
calls into question the assertion that the second line is merely a transport
line.
With the DWP worker's permission, I photographed a blueprint. The prints
came out somewhat fuzzy, although the demarcation of two lines was clear.
I then secured the services of a professional photographer, and we arranged
to go to a Spiniello work site to commit the blueprints to film, hopefully
with greater resolution. When I called Spiniello, located in Santa Fe
Springs, California, to inquire at which location a crew would be, I was
refused that information. The supervisor refusing to reveal where the DWP
contracting company was working the first week in August, 2004, only
identified himself as "Greg," and would not reveal his surname.
Considering the enormous difficulties in obtaining information on public
works water projects, the documentation for this story is at this time not
as complete as this reporter would have wished.
However, we have offered photos of valves that simply have a certain
capability, and the denial by DWP that these are used at all in the capacity
photographed.
