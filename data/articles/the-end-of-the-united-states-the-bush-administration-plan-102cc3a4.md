George Bush, and the policies attributed to him
and his administration, are part of a sweeping conspiracy designed to bring
about a chain of events that will eventually topple the United States of
America and hasten the planned approach of
a unified global government.
While my theory would certainly be an intricate proposition deserving of an
epic amount of verbiage, I will endeavor to explain my position through a
series of concise statements designed to inspire your input and discussion.
A Predisposition For a
Costly War
While intended to be highly humorous, the line from the movie "Princes
Bride" is exceptionally accurate and in this case, apropos:
"Never get involved in a land war in Asia."
Based on the widely available historical record,
we know that this president began his administration with an intent to find
reason to invade Iraq.
Long before
the events of 9/11/2001, the
administration made it clear to high-level staffers that Saddam Hussein was
in the cross-hairs.
Fabricated
Rationale For a War Known to be Costly
All but the most staunch Bush apologists recognize that the rational for an
Iraq war was at best misrepresented, and at worst a fabricated series of
intentional lies.
While unserviceable weapons of
large-scale-destruction (I hesitate to use "mass-destruction") were indeed
discovered rotting way in long-forgotten caches, we now know that Saddam's
claims of WMB were mere Arabic posturing. Learned scholars of the region
desperately attempted to inform Bush, to no avail, that the words of Hussein
were hollow.
No scholar of the history of war and military strategy of the region would
dare conceive of a plan to invade and occupy the region. This is why the
Gulf war stopped short of an invasion and occupation. This is why a career
civilian (Rumsfeld) was selected to devise the war strategy.
As we will see later, the strategy was designed
to fail.
Setting The
Stage - A Plan For Subprime Failure
During the rule of the Bush administration, the difference between between
prime and subprime mortgages (or mark-up) plummeted from 2.8 percent in 2001
to 1.3 percent in 2007.
And the total number of subprime loans created
jumped from 9% of all mortgages in 1996(*) to 20% in 2006(*). The number of
loans dramatically jumped because the risk premium required to issue these
loans dramatically dropped.
Despite widespread concern and gloomy forecasts related to such a large
amount of high-risk debt, the administration and
the Federal bank enabled
broad securitization(*) of these incredibly high risk mortgages into pools
of "mortgage-backed securities" or MBS. This strategy made it possible to
spread the staggering risk, repackaged as securities, throughout the world
economies like a plague of capital-eating viruses.
As the plague spread and high-risk capital became cheap, the inevitable run
on real estate occurred and prizes soared as speculators extended themselves
and low-income buyers financed 105% of their home purchases.
The volatile stage is set with a superabundance
of high-risk no-equity debt on trillions of dollars of over-priced property.
The Deft Timing
of A Catastrophe
Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz recently postulated
that the Iraq war cost the U.S. fifty to sixty times more than the Bush
administration has admitted or predicted.
He further postulates that the war is the
primary reason for
the subprime banking crisis and resulting global
financial crisis.
While the esteemed Mr. Stiglitz is indeed looking in the correct direction,
he's not adjusting his perception to consider conspiracies, and thus, not
prepared to see the obvious - the unimaginably costly war and timing of the
subprime financial crisis were expertly manipulated to coincide for maximum
global collateral damage.
The Brilliant
Strategy of a Globalist
Much has been speculated about the globalist posture of the Bush
Administration.
As conspiracy theorists, we've witnessed the
expansion of:
-
the "North American Free Trade Agreement"
-
the baby-steps
toward the Amero
-
unthinkable immigration policies for a conservative
-
his
remarks that the "Constitution is just a piece of paper"
-
the endorsement of
North American integration in the Guantajuato Proposal
-
the creation of
the North American Competitiveness Council
Also, we conspiracy theorists have recognized
the global government agenda of the so-called "NeoCons" and their chess-like
strategy to sacrifice short term losses for the ultimate win.
The End of it
All
Economic estimates of the total cost of the war in Iraq have exceeded
two
trillion dollars (Stiglitz & Bilmes).
The war is a failure, because it was designed to
fail. The brokers of power were more interested in organizing colossal
financial mismanagement and waste than actual strategic results.
Economic estimates of the global impact of the subprime crisis exceed one
trillion dollars in banking write-downs alone - this figure does not factor
in global loses from MBS failures, foreclosures, lost consumer savings, and
lost property values which could add further trillions to the total. The
brokers of power were more interested in stealthily distributing
unprecedented financial risk than promoting home ownership for consumers.
It is my position that those within the administration who plot such
conspiracies, planned these two financially catastrophic events to culminate
in a crescendo of staggering uncertainty and catastrophic economic failure
late this year, precisely as the 2008 election approaches.
The weakened government soon to be in transition
will inevitably overreact with an ill-conceived financial "bail out" effort,
causing the end of this nation as we know it - a sacrificed rook in the
global chess game of domination.
