On August 7th (2014), President
Obama
authorized airstrikes on Iraq in nominal support of a besieged
population of about 10,000 Yezidis, a Kurdish ethnic minority, who were
placed under siege by the Sunni Jihadist Islamic State, henceforth to be
referred to as (ISIS).
In mainstream media, the intervention has been
criticized as backtracking on what is already a quagmire precipitated by the
2003 American invasion under Bush II, and an occupation inherited and
supervised by Obama from 2008-11.
Another argument is that Obama is showing
his support for the autonomous region of Kurdistan, a U.S. ally whose
leaders provided pivotal assistance to the United States during the
2003-2011 Iraq War.
The document that follows offers a brief history
of the Islamic State entity and the method by which U.S. policies under both
Bush and Obama facilitated its growth, primarily through the opening of
power vacuums created via ill-advised and ruinous imperialist policies.
The underlying irony of this story is that
George W. Bush fabricated a premise for
invading Iraq under the assumption that
Saddam Hussein was harboring al Qaeda
operatives, and what has resulted from the events set in motion by the U.S.
invasion is the fall of a significant portion of Iraq to an organization
even worse than al Qaeda, and the establishment of a jihadist haven the
likes of which bin Laden could have only dreamed.
This is a long document and filled with a great
deal of information about a topic greatly affecting the lives of millions of
innocents across the world. I hope that it finds you well. A few notes on
clarification of terms before I begin
ISIS has gone through several transformations. I
will detail each stage, as well as the US's role within each of them. They
are as follows:
-
Jama'at al Tawhid w'al Jihad (JTJ)
-
Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI)
-
The Islamic State in Iraq (ISI)
-
The Islamic State in Iraq and Sham
(ISIS)
-
The Islamic State (IS)
Note: I am referring to the current incarnation
of the Islamic State as ISIS because it is the abbreviation most familiar to
the Western audience and because it is extremely annoying to use the IS
abbreviation, particularly when typing the phrase "IS is
"
Jama'at al Tawhid w'al
Jihad
The original incarnation of ISIS was founded by
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, America's "boogeyman" in Iraq between the years of
2003-6.
The information I obtained and present to you
here on JTJ and Zarqawi is derived from Loretta Napoleoni's 2005 book,
Insurgent Iraq, which is the best
English-language resource on his life and early organizational activities.
JTJ was, at first, distinct from al-Qaeda in operations, but identical in
ideology.
It was one of the myriad jihadist groups that incubated in
Afghanistan during the 90s up until the U.S. began dropping bombs there in
2001.
Zarqawi and his militia left Afghanistan to take
refuge with (ironically) the Kurdish branch of al-Qaeda, who were based in
the northern mountain ranges of Iraq. It is worth mentioning that this
migration by Zarqawi from Afghanistan to Iraq was one of the key pretexts
that the White House under Bush II gave for invading the country in the
first place.
Saddam had nothing to do with facilitating
Zarqawi's arrival, however, as he was enemies with the Kurds and especially
antagonistic toward foreign jihadists.
I will spend what may seem like an inordinate
amount of time talking about Zarqawi, but it is necessary because he is the
physical and spiritual progenitor of ISIS. If we follow the "great man"
theory of history, I would say that there would be no ISIS today without
Zarqawi and his "vision."
He embodied a mission so extreme and performed
acts of violence so horrific, that he essentially tore through the fabric of
the existing state paradigms of the region. The vacuum he left in his wake
would be filled, successfully it would seem, by his successors.
Zarqawi and his JTJ did not participate in
battles against U.S. forces until August of 2003.
By that time, they had had the opportunity allow
the occupying forces to settle in and had scouted their positions and
tactics. JTJ selected terrorism as its strategy for dominating Iraq, and its
inaugural bombing campaign was directed at both U.S. forces as well as
Shiite civilians.
It was the attacks on the Shiites which
immediately perturbed the jihadist leadership in Afghanistan, including bin
Laden who, at first, demanded Zarqawi cease killing Muslims.
While most jihadists were all for attacking U.S.
forces, attacking Shiites was viewed as too extreme and counterproductive.
In the eyes of the al Qaeda bosses of the time, Shiites were still Muslims,
even if they were not Sunnis, and the goal of bin Laden in particular was to
unite all of the Muslims against the United States in order to expel them
from Iraq.
Bin Laden, however, was not on the ground to
understand the situation from the lens of Zarqawi. Through Zarqawi's looking
glass, tainted as it was, the Shiites were collaborators with the U.S.
occupation and thus enemies of the Sunnis.
The key thing to focus on here is that the U.S.
deliberately adopted a sectarian-based strategy to divide and conquer Iraq
from the outset of its invasion. They intentionally took sides on a
sectarian basis, exploiting a key division in society which ended up
backfiring in their face as I will expound upon later.
Pre-invasion, the U.S. had negotiated with a
number of Iraqi dissidents, but the majority of the Iraqis who helped the
United States plan the invasion were Shiites and Kurds. Thus, these became
the favored groups and, notably, the U.S. did not station its forces in the
Shiite south of Iraq, instead leaving the responsibility up to the British
whose mission was more symbolic than operations-oriented.
Meanwhile, Zarqawi migrated from Kurdistan and
found refuge amongst the Iraqi Sunni tribes in West and Central Iraq.
Iraqi Tribal System
It is necessary to talk about this system
because it is a key part of the conflict and often overlooked.
Norman Cigar, a researcher and professor
at the Marine Corps University, wrote a highly detailed and informative
book on the
tribal dynamics between Salafist organizations and the Iraqi tribes. I
obtained much of my information on the politics of these tribes from him.
The tribal system is exactly as it sounds: it is
an ancient institution which distributes power and control on a hereditary
basis.
Within each tribe, there is a subset of clans,
then individual families, and so on. The largest tribal confederations in
Iraq number in the hundreds of thousands and the largest tribe, the Dulaim,
is three million strong.
These people essentially enforce their own laws,
and the failure to end or marginalize the tribal system by local state
actors is a large reason why the Middle East remains so backward and
violent. They essentially act as a state-within-a-state and have proved to
be wonderful proxies for meddling foreign powers, including the British
during the colonial era.
Cigar notes that the Sunni tribes also came into
prominence in Iraq after the Iran-Iraq war and First Gulf War in 1991.
Saddam was badly weakened internally by these
conflicts and thus fell back on the tribes to bail him out politically as
Shiites and Kurds began rebellions against his rule. Tribal leaders assumed
high ranks in the Iraqi Army, thus entrenching their power.
The tribes became Iraq's powerbrokers and
naturally saw the U.S. invasion and Saddam's subsequent demise as a direct
threat to their newfound dominance.
However the tribal system has its weaknesses.
Because tribes are so enormous, and because power is concentrated at the
very top of the hierarchy in accord with an irrational tradition where
heredity implies merit, the tribes give rise to large swathes of disaffected
men.
Essentially, the tribal system can be modeled
with a pyramid structure where the men at the bottom lose out on privileges,
i.e. jobs, monetary handouts, and wives. Furthermore, because Islam permits
polygamy with up to four wives, men at the bottom of this pyramid often miss
out on mating opportunities.
Tribes tend to be highly fundamentalist in their
interpretation of Islam largely because fundamentalist Islam is a system
which offers considerable advantages to tribal alpha males, such as the
aforementioned polygamy.
The creator of Islam, Muhammad, was a tribal
warlord himself.
Sectarian violence in
Iraq during the U.S. occupation
Zarqawi's stated aim was to precipitate a
sectarian civil war between Sunnis and Shiites.
His goal was to undermine Iraqi nationalism for
reasons I will explain later. Most Sunnis were
not on board with this plan, particularly the jihadist leadership in
Afghanistan and the majority of Sunnis in Iraq.
The tribal warlords who held sway in the Sunni
regions of Iraq (located in the central, west, and northern parts of the
country) had everything to lose from a protracted war against the Shiites
who were ~66% of the population. Their plan was instead to establish a
confederacy within the borders of Iraq so that they could practice a degree
of autonomy.
The warlords viewed Zarqawi as a foreign
troublemaker and harped on the fact that he had come from Afghanistan to
wage war against a "foreign power" when he himself was a foreigner to Iraq
meddling in Iraqi affairs.
According to Napoleoni, Zarqawi was well aware
of his perception as a foreigner, but did not accept it as valid criticism.
He did not consider the Sykes-Picot arrangement as valid, and sought to
redraw the region's boundaries on sectarian lines instead.
In his view, he was not an outsider, but a
Muslim in the lands of Islam. Zarqawi opposed Iraqi nationalism because
Iraqi nationalism was a dire threat to his life, his mission, and his
organization. If the Sunnis rallied around a nationalistic banner, his
pan-Islamic organization's ideology would become viewed as a threat to be
excised by not just Shiites, but also his Sunni brethren.
Through his terrorism in the name of Sunni
Islam, he attempted to poison the well of Sunni-Shiite relations so
extensively that a unified state would become impossible. With the power
vacuum left by Saddam's fall, it appeared Zarqawi had plenty of space to
maneuver and craft such a venomous milieu.
Ironically, Iraqi nationalism was also a strong
danger to the United States. Chapter 10 in Insurgent Iraq describes a
botched campaign of prewar bribery, one where the U.S. had managed to stoke
resentment even within their supposed Shiite allies.
The funds it distributed to the Shiite political
warlords who helped pave the way for its invasion were (predictably) corrupt
and hoarding money intended for the Iraqi public amongst themselves and
their cronies.
Furthermore, Washington's Shiite agents were
mostly composed of individuals who had been expelled from Iraq by Saddam
during the 80s and 90s. Many of them had not set foot in Iraq for years.
These new U.S.-sponsored political leaders were alien to the local Iraqis,
notably the powerful clerics of the Sadr family.
Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shiite cleric backed
by his Mahdi Army militia, claimed to represent the interests of his sect's
poor and downtrodden in Iraq. Sadr was essentially the warlord of Baghdad's
Shiite slums and his men battled U.S. forces throughout Baghdad in response
to the occupation.
Sadr openly shunned the upper class Shiites
collaborating with U.S. occupation forces, choosing instead to ally himself
with Iran in exchange for funds and training for his militiamen. This
development was important because it provided a political and military entry
point for Iran into the Iraq War.
Effectively, the U.S. had thus created enemies
with both the Sunnis and the Shiite lower class.
The nightmare scenario for the United States was
that Sadr's Mahdi Army would sign an agreement with the Sunni insurgent
groups in West Iraq, thereby forming a unified national front against the
U.S. occupation and critically endangering any claim they might have made on
forming a government in the name of national unity. The U.S. thus had to
undermine Iraqi nationalism from coming into being under the pretext of
armed opposition to the U.S. occupation.
They instead sought to funnel nationalism, via a
system of bribery and military force, into a U.S.-dominated order held aloft
by a charade of democratic elections.
Of course, this bribery was not effective in
actually building a coherent Iraqi nation. Factions would participate in
elections only to keep the American money flowing and, as we will see, when
the U.S. left, Iraq broke down along militant sectarian lines again.
The farce of Iraqi "democracy" was a PR stunt to
convince Americans that Bush and the neocons had not swindled America out of
billions for a war that had failed on its original promises and was
producing countless casualties on both sides.
According to Norman Cigar, the U.S. believed it
would be able to ignore the Sunnis at the outset of the Iraqi rebuilding
effort, and thus focused its bribery efforts on the Shiites and Kurds,
funneling money to cooperative "politicians" and granting them power within
a U.S.-designed state. The Sunnis responded to the American strategy with a
sustained revolt against the U.S. occupation between 2003-8, coming to a
head in two battles for Fallujah in 2004.
Chapter 11 of Insurgent Iraq describes
how it was during the second battle of Fallujah that JTJ made a name for
itself as one of the vanguard groups of the Iraqi resistance.
The U.S. stated their goal in Fallujah was the
dismantlement the "Zarqawi network" purported to be based there. Despite
massive destruction and devastation inflicted on Fallujah from an American
encirclement and siege, they failed to do so, probably because Zarqawi
wasn't even in Fallujah to begin with.
Following America's failure to dismantle JTJ
with such an enormous show of force, Zarqawi became a superstar among
jihadists worldwide.
Islam and tribalism
Political Islam has always sought to undermine
the power of the tribes.
Muhammad himself was a low-ranking member of the
Quraysh tribe and his story, if we are to look at it rationally, is
essentially about how he used a divine pretext to overthrow the tribal
leaders of his own family and assume the dominant position.
The ideology of ISIS and al-Qaeda is referred to
as "Salafism," and it is a movement stressing a return to the literal and
metaphysical foundations of Islam. It even entails mimicking the lifestyle
of Muhammad and his followers in 7th century Arabia.
This is considered an insane proposition to many
Muslims (and non-Muslims), but this brand of piety does find a very large
following in tribal regions across the Muslim world. One reason for this is
that many of the lower caste tribal youth resonate very strongly with the
story of Muhammad and seek to recreate his
story.
Tribal systems, even those outside of the Arab
world in places like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kurdistan, are breeding
grounds for this type of religious fanaticism.
The Salafists seek to replace the irrational
authority of the tribal warlords with the irrational authority of religious
scholars and Mujahidin.
JTJ metamorphoses into Al Qaeda in Iraq
After the second battle of Fallujah, Zarqawi's
propaganda apparatus purported him as one of the heroes of the fight against
the Americans.
As the legend went, he was one of the few who
had stood his ground against suicidal odds and clambered out of the rubble
to fight another day. Zarqawi still had problems with legitimacy and funding
in Iraq.
The issue of legitimacy arose from the
persistent nationalist angle perpetuated by Sunni Iraqis, as well as his
lack of religious authority.
According to Cigar, to cope with the first
problem, he had to start recruiting Sunnis from within Iraq in order to give
the organization a more "national" flavor. He got these recruits from the
lower strata of the Iraqi tribal system. Essentially, he offered these
individuals, who had no hope of social mobility in their own system due to
birth order, an opportunity to have a stake in a new, Islamic "tribe."
Loretta Napoleoni described Zarqawi as
functionally illiterate, and militant Islamists derive much of their social
support from the fact that their leaders are titular experts in Islamic
doctrine in a region where theology is considered the supreme form of
thought.
Zarqawi's Sunni rivals were able to encourage
Islamic scholars in Iraq to label his mission of establishing a caliphate
and an Islamic State theologically impure, and so he was losing the ability
to find recruits and find sanctuary amongst the members of his sect.
He had to find religious authorities to sanction
his mission, and he found that lifeline with a couple of old associates:
Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri: the
heads of al Qaeda in Afghanistan, religious scholars, and experts in
jihadist financing.
The alliance between Zarqawi and bin Laden was
mutually beneficial.
Osama bin Laden wanted a stake in the
Iraqi violence, as the war in Afghanistan was going poorly for him. He
offered to make Zarqawi an "emir" of al Qaeda, essentially making him a
sponsored warlord of Iraq and giving him access to all of Qaeda's financial
and political connections in the Arab Gulf.
Bin Laden also issued religious edicts
sanctifying Zarqawi's mission, thus granting him, at the very least, a
temporary theological shield with which to ward off the lacerating words of
his critics.
Ironically, the US's harping on Zarqawi as a
boogeyman made him more popular. It was free publicity for him.
One of the reasons why bin Laden selected
Zarqawi as his emir was because he was by far the most well-known jihadist,
and such an alliance would bring great prestige to al Qaeda.
However, this also implicitly meant that bin
Laden signed onto Zarqawi's sectarian war. This development is ironic given
that JTJ was only one of many jihadist factions, but the U.S., in its
desperation to fabricate a strawman it could point to as "proof" that
American forces had a coherent enemy in Iraq, ended up bringing to life the
fictional Frankenstein they'd been obsessively parading before the eyes of
the world.
It is a sad fact that much of the current Iraqi
tragedy came about because of Bush's cynicism and narcissism in trying to
sell across propaganda points to the American public.
In 2005, JTJ changed its name to al-Qaeda in
Iraq (AQI) and continued its bombing attacks. By 2006, Zarqawi got what he
finally looking for: a civil war in Iraq between Sunnis and Shiites.
Hostilities erupted after his operatives blew up the
Askari
shrine, one of the holiest sites in Shiite Islam. These massive
sectarian hostilities were the de facto end of Iraq within its Sykes-Picot
borders.
However, in addition to the Shiites, Zarqawi had
also managed to precipitate a war against the Sunni tribal warlords in Iraq
who began to see him as a serious threat to their rule now that he was
recruiting their lower caste to fight against them.
This AQI-Tribal war heated up significantly in
2005 when Zarqawi bombed hotels in
Jordan and
Egypt,
which were housing Iraqi tribal leaders who had found sanctuary there away
from the Iraqi violence. This move was his undoing, as Zarqawi had then
created enough Iraqi enemies that he had scant few places to find refuge.
AQI had bitten off more than it could chew, now
fighting a war against the superpower, Sunni tribal warlords, and the Shiite
majority of Iraq.
Zarqawi was finally killed in a U.S. airstrike
in July 2006. He was replaced by another operative named Abu Ayyub al Masri
who steered AQI in much the same way that Zarqawi had, focusing on
"high-profile" bombings of Shiite targets, usually civilians and the holy
shrines and mosques sacred to them.
Sahwa Militias and the
disintegration of the Iraqi state
In 2005, general elections were held in Iraq,
which the Sunnis boycotted. I am jumping around here in the timeline, but I
promise this section will end being temporally coherent.
All of the information I use on Sahwa militias
and other players mentioned in this section can be found in Norman Cigar's
book.
With the Sunni boycott, the United States again
had a problem with its PR in that one of the three major sects refused to
recognize the legitimacy of the Iraqi state, thus detonating the premise of
Iraqi nationalism being the unifying factor behind the new government.
Sunnis had no interest in joining an order
dominated by Shiites and Kurds.
By the U.S.-designed law, the president of Iraq
must be a Kurd, and the prime minister will inevitably be Shiite since they
are more than 60% of the population of Iraq.
Sunnis thus had very little interest in
democracy in a place where they were heavily outnumbered. They were the
kingmakers under Saddam and were not willing to join the government
established by the Americans. For them, no Iraq would be better than an Iraq
under American-imposed circumstances and Shiite rule.
U.S. command viewed JTJ/AQI as an obstacle in
getting Sunni popular opinion on their side, and so they began searching for
divisions within the sect that they could exploit and thus rattle Zarqawi's
power base.
They found agents with the tribal warlords whom
the Salafist groups had greatly agitated and warred against. Trial runs of
arming Zarqawi's tribal enemies began in 2005, but it was not until
September 2006 that agreements between tribal warlords and the United States
to fight the Salafists went public.
This strategic maneuver on the Americans' part
enraged the Shiite political establishment because, by then, the sectarian
war between Sunnis and Shiites had reached a fevered pitch. Shiites viewed
the U.S.-Tribal alliance as an act of treachery, believing that the U.S. was
trying to engineer a stalemate, exhaust both sides, and prolong the war.
Arming Sunni tribal militias, who now called
themselves the "Sahwa" (translation: Awakening) in Iraq, was a critical
juncture in the country's history.
In bolstering the military might of a sector of
the Iraqi population that had already historically existed as a "state" for
centuries, the Americans further eroded any chance that the Shiite-dominated
Iraqi central government could exercise a monopoly on force within its
Sykes-Picot geography.
Around the time of its alliance with the Sahwa,
the U.S. also began to design its "surge" strategy where it would increase
the number of U.S. troops by 20,000 in the Sunni regions of Iraq.
Like the Shiites the U.S. funded, these Sahwa
leaders were also corrupt and hoarded their cash stockpiles.
The U.S. was spending millions of dollars a day
on these Sahwa militias and incompetence and corruption was rife - it was
estimated that the rosters submitted to U.S. command for salary payments by
tribal leaders were padded with up to 60% fake names, and these warlords
spent the American-distributed cash on frivolities like mansions painted
pink, stables of race horses, and sports cars - all courtesy of the U.S.
taxpayer (or the Federal Reserve, depending on how you look at it).
However, the U.S. kept paying because the
strategy was working, and the Sahwa were successful in curbing the
activities of AQI.
They probably ratted out Zarqawi to the U.S.,
who killed him in the aforementioned 2006 air strike, and they also helped
locate and kill Zarqawi's successors. At their height, the Sahwa fielded an
estimated 118,000 men in Iraq.
For comparisons sake, AQI probably had only
1,000 operatives, many of whom were probably foreign fighters alien to the
terrain.
I will now skip an expanse of time, from 2007 to
2011, because these four years essentially see the marginalization and near
disintegration of AQI thanks to the efforts of the Sahwa militias. During
these years, AQI also changes its name to the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI)
and takes a more Iraq-centric focus, consolidating its dwindling power base
there.
However, geopolitical earthquakes would rock the
region in 2011 and rattle what was considered to be Zarqawi's absurd and
unfulfilled fantasy of restoring the Caliphate back to life.
Describing Jihadi
Organizations
I'm including this section in order to better
explain how these jihadist organizations derive their power.
The jihadist mission is easily compared to
European colonial-settler movements that were popular in the 19th century,
only jihad is an export from the Gulf Arab states and thus assumes an Arab
"flavor" (which makes me nauseous, might I add).
Because these Gulf states
derive their vast wealth from
pumping black stuff out of the ground rather than contributing
intellectual and scientific value to civilization, they can afford to
indulge in self-serving religious backwardness.
This fosters societies low on human capital,
high in monetary capital, a cultish obsession with Islam, and a demographic
of men willing to venture abroad to conquer other nations using religion as
their pretext.
The Middle East is, as you may have
long-realized, a medieval place.
The tribal regions are, generally, stuck in the
10th or 11th century in terms of their thinking, as evidenced by their
hereditary distribution of power, fundamentalist religiosity, and lack of
industry. The most dangerous tribes are those like the Saudis, who have vast
wealth and thus access to all of the First World's weapons.
The al-Saud tribe derives its rule from internal
religious authorities.
People like Zarqawi and bin Laden were
essentially looking to replicate the example of the al-Saud's elsewhere in
the world. In Zarqawi's case, it was Iraq; in bin Laden's, Afghanistan.
Al Qaeda's leadership are religious scholars.
Bin Laden himself was probably an adept of Islamic theology, although it is
equally likely that he purchased his Islamic "degree" and flaunted it as
proof of his authority given how wealthy he was relative to his
contemporaries.
Although I used the colonial analogy, I also
like to think of Al Qaeda and similar organizations as being the Muslim
analogs to the Catholic Church in the medieval era, back when they sent
mercenaries on "Crusades" to conquer foreign, un-Christian lands.
Like the Crusaders, these al Qaeda operatives
traverse the world in search of apostates to kill and a land upon which to
establish their holy state.
It is my opinion that the reason why there are
sects in the first place is due to the fact that one warlord using religious
"authority" runs up against another person using the same religious
authority and they essentially split off into divergent and antagonistic
religio-tribal organizations.
In the Arab world, the people who obsessively
accuse others of apostasy as a pretext for violence are called
Takfiris. This term is
used in a pejorative manner, as the strategy of declaring enemies to be
apostate is well known and has been performed throughout history by
troublemakers.
ISIS is the best example of a Takfiri
organization.
Takfirism is analogous to the prevalent tactic
in the West conflating adversaries with Hitler and Nazis, or as "enemies of
democracy."
2011
The two critical events that occurred in 2011
were the civil wars in Libya and Syria, as well as the U.S. withdrawal from
Iraq.
The fall of Gaddafi produced a strategic
situation which saw Libyan jihadists, with the help of U.S. air support,
overrun Libya. What resulted was a situation where these jihadists opened up
Gaddafi's weapons stores to every other Jihadi group in the Middle East to
purchase, and the war in Syria was the primary market for these "liberated"
arms caches.
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Qatar were making
several airlifts and cargo shipments from Libya to Turkey and back in
order to facilitate the dispensation of weapons to an assortment of rebels,
including ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, the "official" al-Qaeda franchise in
Syria.
These arms ended up reenergizing the jihadist
movement in Syria.
So, ironically, the United States, in
destabilizing Libya, helped to pave the way for the rise of ISIS when a
flood of fresh Libyan weapons came into their hands, most notably antitank
and even anti-air weapons. The Libyan intervention is likely to go down as
one of the greatest blunders of American foreign policy, as it has created
yet another jihadist
outpost, this time on African soil.
The war in Syria, unlike the Libyan conflict, is
defined as a sectarian war similar to the Iraq's. The "president" of Syria
(really just the leader of the largest fighting force) is Bashar al-Assad, a
member of the Alawite sect of Islam. To Sunni jihadists, rule by an apostate
Alawite is obviously unacceptable, and he is thus a great target for
Takfirist defamation, especially given the fact that Syria is 80% Sunni.
It was easy to paint Assad as a committed
oppressor of Sunnis given these circumstances, and such sentiment was
greatly fueled by the fact that the Sunnis were largely the losers of Iraq's
civil war and perpetual victims of a continuing Shiite conspiracy to
dominate Sunni Islam.
However, not to say Assad is even remotely a
good guy, but his wife is a Sunni, and much of his army and its command are
Sunnis as well. In other words, the idea that Assad is necessarily sectarian
is
false.
As the Libyan and Syrian wars ensued and set
each respective country back a hundred years or more, the U.S. began its
preparations to leave Iraq in 2011. Part of this meant that they would cease
their payments to the Sahwa militias, instantaneously leaving vast swathes
of Sunni street thugs
unemployed and politically marginalized.
In arming these militias, the Americans had
created a state-within-a-state situation. According to Cigar, The central
government had no authority to rein these militias in, and integrating the
militias into the armed forces had failed.
What ensued after the U.S. withdrawal was the
fracturing of the "central" (really Shiite, Baghdad-based) government along
sectarian lines. The Shiite Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, sent Shiite
troops to occupy the Sunni towns in Iraq, where they massacred civilians,
and deposed Sunni politicians.
Maliki even sentenced a former Sunni vice
president, who served up until 2009, to
death in absentia.
Simultaneously, because of the sectarian
overtones of the Syrian war, Sunni donors from the Gulf states began to
contribute vast amounts of money to al Qaeda central leadership in the Af-Pak
tribal belt in order to fund the jihad against Assad.
Al Qaeda subsequently increased the funding of
its Iraqi cells to join the fight in Syria, as they were still operational
on the Syrian border. ISI operatives were to infiltrate Syria under the
organizational title "Jabhat al-Nusra" (JN), which translates to "The Front
of Helpers."
Due to the fact that many former Sahwa
militiamen were now broke with the departure of the United States, and
because there was little use for their skills as career thugs outside the
army in Iraq's economy, many joined the fight in Syria under facilitation by
JN. JN thus found a stable base within Iraq from which they could launch
strikes into Syria.
This Qaeda-tribal realignment represents another
pivotal point in the history of ISIS.
U.S. destabilization of
Syria
In its support for
toppling
Assad by aiding the
Syrian rebels, many of whose allegiances exist in a state of flux and who
have defected to ISIS, the U.S. essentially made it possible for ISIS to
rise and take command of eastern Syria.
While you can argue that Washington probably
didn't directly arm and train ISIS, it nonetheless facilitated and supported
a chaos scenario where ISIS could rise to the top of the jihadist hierarchy.
Ironically, in 2010, Assad
offered to assist the U.S. in a war against Takfiri rebels operating on
the Iraqi-Syrian border. Assad's government has fought jihadists for decades
and considered themselves "experts" on the affair.
The U.S. refused and, in 2011, they armed
jihadists instead to depose Assad.
Jabhat al Nusra and ISIS
JN quickly gained a reputation as being the most
extreme (and most effective) rebel fighting group in Syria.
They were better funded, better trained, and
many had had years of experience fighting U.S. occupation forces in Iraq.
One of the byproducts of wars is the creation of a class of experienced
fighters. While many militants die in these infantry-based guerilla wars,
the ones who survive tend to be resilient given their experience advantage.
JN had a great number of survivors from
conflicts in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and Chechnya.
Furthermore, the extreme factions will often
find the best recruits and people most willing to join up with their cause.
If you look at the history of statehood in general, it is usually the most
murderous and extreme of the militias who rise to power. This was true of
the Leninists in Russia, the Zionists in Palestine, and it appears ISIS in
Iraq/Syria.
JN eventually fractured, however, forming a
splinter group called the Islamic State in Iraq and Sham (Sham = Levant in
Arabic).
Effectively, the ISI fraction of JN had gotten "too
extreme" for al Qaeda's tastes. Perhaps too much of Zarqawi's ghost had
lived on in the organization. This schism precipitated bloodshed between JN
members and the newly formed ISIS, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
JN was getting a lot of negative press in the
West and the greater Middle East because of its penchant for using massacres
as a tool for terrorizing populations into submission, as well as other
heinous crimes such as mass rapes of female captives and wanton looting.
Ironically, ISIS practiced Takfirism against JN in order to justify its
split.
The schism was likely a calculated move on the
part of ISIS, who were now the main players on the Iraqi-Syrian border.
They did not need AQ central leadership because
they had enough support from the Iraqi tribal system to survive and thrive.
ISIS
What distinguished ISIS from the rest of the
militias operating in Syria was that it had a coherent goal of statehood in
mind, while other groups were just focused on toppling Assad.
The state-building project entailed a focus on
combat, but also a considerable attention was given to subduing the civilian
population through propaganda and terror. The group was experienced in both
facets of sowing the seeds of statehood, having had years of practice in
Iraq and in other conflicts around the globe, most notably the
Chechen-Russian wars.
ISIS also has an
international angle, unlike the Syrian and Iraqi nationalist militias.
This international focus gives them access to a
far larger pool of recruits, and has enabled them to link up with several
other jihadist factions across the world, notably the Chechen jihadists and
other fighters across Europe and the Caucuses.
The Chechens are also highly experienced
fighters, having fought the Russians for years, and so they constitute one
of the most deadly fighting forces in Iraq and Syria. The field commander of
ISIS operates under the field name
Abu Omar al-Shishani (literally Abu Omar The Chechen).
ISIS's breakout moment was their June 2014
invasion of northern Iraq, which began with a
jailbreak of thousands of Sunni prisoners from Iraqi military jails. In
the eyes of ISIS, the Iraqi military are essentially a Shiite militia,
referring to them pejoratively as the "Army of the Safavids," with
Safavid being a
reference to medieval Persian, Shiite rulers of Mesopotamia.
Following this jailbreak, ISIS launched a
blitz on northern Iraq, seizing Mosul, Iraq's oil-rich, and second
largest city, as well as taking control of towns all over western and
central Iraq.
The U.S.-trained Iraqi army, which took billions
of dollars and years to create, effectively
collapsed in 24 hours. 30,000 Iraqi troops shrank back in the face of
about 3,000 ISIS militiamen, resulting in one of the greatest military routs
in the region's history.
If you remember how I mentioned previously that
a great deal of this jihadist doctrine is tied into the militias viewing
themselves as walking the path of the ancient, "untainted" Muslims around
the time of Muhammad, then this episode featuring the ISIS blitzkrieg unto
Iraq was a fulfillment of prophecy in the minds of Sunnis and ISIS.
The original Muslim conquests of Mesopotamia and
the Levant proceeded in the same blitz fashion, where a small army of
Muslims
conquered
Byzantine and Persian armies which often outnumbered them by 4 or 5
times. The conquest by ISIS affirmed in the minds of Sunnis that history was
repeating itself as the "true Muslims" routed the infidels thanks to the
grace of god and the holiness of their mission.
However, the real story is less fantastical.
ISIS had only took over the Sunni areas of Iraq which were under effective
occupation by Shiite forces. Shiite troops and even the Sunnis serving
alongside them in the Iraqi army had no interest in losing their lives for
the sake of a corrupt authority in Baghdad bent on policing a disparate
Sunni population. They dropped their guns, ran and were summarily routed by
ISIS.
Shiites
were executed and Sunnis were spared as part of an ISIS amnesty program
for their fellow Sunnis who had gone "wayward."
The sparing of the lives of Sunnis is actually a
development in the tactics of ISIS, as they were against such amnesty
policies in their past, less compromising iterations, notably under Zarqawi.
ISIS publicized images and video of the rout and
ensuing capture of hundreds of Shiite troops, executing them on camera in
systematic fashion. This represented Iraq officially splitting on its
sectarian lines.
Because the Iraqi Army left their equipment
largely intact,
ISIS got access to tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters (which
they don't know how to use yet), and a large amount of ammunition, uniforms,
and other types of hardware to help them consolidate rule over north and
central Iraq.
In addition, they robbed the central bank of
Mosul and other banks across Iraq which led to them claiming up to
400 million dollars in cash.
In addition to the arms and cash, ISIS also
seized the precious bounty of oil fields across northern Iraq and now makes
perhaps
3 million a day in black market oil sales according to experts.
Cash and oil has made ISIS self-sufficient, and
it is perhaps this conquest strategy is a large reason why they abandoned al
Qaeda central leadership to begin with. ISIS had no intention on sharing the
spoils of their hard-fought labor with an isolated leadership far away from
the battlefield in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The success of ISIS has led hundreds of people
from Europe and other parts of the world streaming into the area under ISIS
control to pledge allegiance to their organization, with some estimated
6,300 aspiring jihadists migrating to Syria and Mesopotamia in the month
of July 2014 alone.
Upon conquering northern and central Iraq, ISIS
changed its name to the Islamic State (IS), and declared Abu Bakr
al-Baghdadi as Caliph Ibrahim. Upon declaration of the restoration of the
Caliphate, the Kurds also formally announced their
plans to break from the Iraqi central government, hearkening the
subsequent rebirth of Kurdistan.
In response to the ISIS takeover, Obama sent
300 advisors
to Iraq. Ironically, the Iranian revolutionary guards are also in Iraq at
the time of this writing to help bolster the defenses of Baghdad in
expectation of an ISIS push to take control of Baghdad.
At the end of August, Obama announced yet
another 300 troops were to be sent back to Mesopotamia following the
execution of American reporter James Foley and ISIS threats to murder
another, Steven Sotloff.
The Islamic State and
Kurdistan
The Kurds are dispersed throughout the Middle
East, although they have a large territory in the Northeast of Iraq in the
mountain ranges between Iraq and Iran and on the border with Turkey.
Ironically, this is where Zarqawi initially
found refuge when he fled Afghanistan.
ISIS began operations on Kurdistan in late July
of this year, but prior to the commencement of those hostilities, they had
been rooting out religious minorities under their dominion in Mosul and
Anbar province.
The message to the non-Sunnis was to convert to
Islam or pay a "jizya," which is essentially a tax for not being a Sunni
Muslim. After a short period, ISIS arbitrarily changed the message to "leave
or die," thus triggering an exodus of Christians from northern Iraq.
After the Christians, the jihadists turned their
sights on the Kurds, and the opening of this front is where the line in the
sand was drawn by the United States. In the geopolitical theater, Obama had
no intentions on allowing ISIS to usurp Kurdistan, as such a development
posed a grave threat to the geopolitical balance in the region as it would
place ISIS on the borders of both Iran and Turkey.
Iraqi Kurdistan is a socially divided entity.
There are
Salafi jihadist Kurds who generally are youth and low caste tribesmen.
Kurds are also mostly Sunni Muslim, which would have meant that the
transnational ISIS would possibly be able to incorporate Kurdistan as one of
its "emirates."
The Kurdish leadership has a good relationship
with Washington, as they were the chief, unflinching collaborators with the
U.S. occupation. They are also considered a vital part of the intelligence
apparatus in the greater Middle East area, as they work with Mossad and the
CIA to
spy on neighboring Iran.
International outcry came about once ISIS added
the Yezidi religious group to its genocidal hit list, leading to a set of
massacres and the hot pursuit of a civilian Yezidi population up Shingal
Mountain.
The Yezidis
began dying of
thirst in the caves of their makeshift stronghold in the ensuing ISIS
siege and it was at this time that the Americans made a humanitarian air
drop to them while the world watched on. Assistance to Yezidis facing
genocide was the political cover story for launching airstrikes on ISIS.
The way I see Washington's message to ISIS is,
"don't mess with the Kurds, you can have
everything else."
While Obama was probably willing to tolerate the
Sunni parts of Iraq falling to ISIS, the Kurdish regions were a red line.
This is evidenced by the fact that there was no
vitriolic reaction to the fall of Mosul and the drive of ISIS toward
Baghdad. In fact, the central government of Iraq essentially had to turn to
the
Russians,
who are allied with Assad and Iran, in order to assist them with the vital
problems facing their rule in Iraq.
Furthermore, there is the question as to why
NATO member Turkey never sought to crush ISIS, despite the fact that they
were willing to go as far as to stage a
false flag attack on their own civilians to justify such a measure.
Perhaps the U.S. did not trust the Turks enough
not to violate the sovereignty of the Kurds, whom they have been in
on-and-off wars
with for decades.
The relatively muted U.S. response, which
includes only limited airstrikes, and only airstrikes in ISIS's Iraqi half,
could be because it wants to keep ISIS intact enough that it continues to
constitute a thorn in the side of Iran on its eastern border and Assad in
the West.
Perhaps Washington has learned its lesson
regarding the dangers of creating
power vacuums.
The best case scenario for Washington may be a
prolonged war between the Sunnis of Iraq and the Levant and the Shiite
countries bordering them.
Notes on the Kurds
The information I'm including below is not to
vilify Kurds, but rather to provide some clarity about the people who
Washington is supporting.
Kurdish rule in Iraq is essentially a
dictatorship led by the Barzani clan. It is a tribal area, like the culture
of their Sunni Arab adversaries. In 2011, they violently
suppressed protests by their fellow Kurds protesting the Barzani
dictatorship.
It is also an area where female genital
mutilation is considered normal and, despite a nominal "ban" in response to
Western pressure, the practice
continues unabated.
Note, male genital mutilation is also endemic
across the Middle East, although it is FGM which generally gets Westerners
up in arms, so I highlight this because it flies in the face of the
narrative purported by the U.S. government that it is assisting a free,
democratic bastion of civilization against murderous religious fanatics.
Truth is, it is one medieval set of people
clashing with against another set of people whose psychologies lie somewhere
between the invention of the agriculture and the Industrial Revolution.
Notes on U.S.
involvement
I think it is necessary to recap how the U.S.
helped precipitate this crisis:
-
They invaded Iraq, thus upsetting the
balance of power there and leaving a vacuum to be filled by Zarqawi
and JTJ
-
They pursued a policy of sectarian
divide-and-conquer, thus effectively setting up sectarian military
boundaries in Iraq when they simultaneously armed Sunni tribes
alongside the Shiite-dominated central government
-
The attack on Libya that toppled Gaddafi
created the rise of jihadists there and a subsequent flood of
weapons into Syria that bolstered ISIS
-
U.S. support for rebel groups in Syria
undermined Assad who was a bulwark against Jihadism in the region,
again bolstering ISIS
