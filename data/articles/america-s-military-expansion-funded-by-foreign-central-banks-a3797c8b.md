Large amounts of surplus dollars are pouring
into the rest of the world.
Central banks have recycled these dollar inflows
towards the purchase of U.S. Treasury bonds, which serve to finance the
federal U.S. budget deficit. Underlying this process is the military
character of the U.S. payments deficit and the domestic federal budget
deficit.
Strange as it may seem and irrational as it
would be in a more logical system of world diplomacy, the "dollar glut" is
what finances Americas global military build-up. It forces foreign central
banks to bear the costs of Americas expanding military empire: effective
"taxation without representation".
Keeping international reserves in "dollars" means recycling their dollar
inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bills, namely, U.S. government debt issued
largely to finance the military.
To date, countries have been as powerless to defend themselves against the
fact that this compulsory financing of U.S. military spending is built into
the global financial system. Neoliberal economists applaud this as
"equilibrium", as if it is part of economic nature and "free markets" rather
than bare-knuckle diplomacy wielded with increasing aggressiveness by U.S.
officials.
The mass media chime in, pretending that
recycling the dollar glut to finance U.S. military spending is showing their
faith in U.S. economic strength by sending "their" dollars here to "invest".
It is as if a choice is involved, not financial
and diplomatic compulsion to choose merely between "Yes" (from China,
reluctantly), "Yes, please" (from Japan and the European Union) and "Yes,
thank you" (from Britain, Georgia and Australia).
It is not "foreign faith in the U.S. economy" that leads foreigners to "put
their money here".
This is a silly anthropomorphic picture of a more
sinister dynamic. The "foreigners" in question are not consumers buying U.S.
exports, nor are they private-sector "investors" buying U.S. stocks and
bonds. The largest and most important foreign entities putting "their money"
here are central banks, and it is not "their money" at all.
They are sending back the dollars that foreign
exporters and other recipients turn over to their central banks for domestic
currency.
When the U.S. payments deficit pumps dollars into foreign economies, these
banks are being given little option except to buy U.S. Treasury bills and
bonds which the Treasury spends on financing an enormous, hostile military
build-up to encircle the major dollar-recyclers:
-
China
-
Japan
-
Arab OPEC
oil producers
Yet these governments are forced to recycle
dollar inflows in a way that funds U.S. military policies in which they have
no say in formulating, and which threaten them more and more belligerently.
That is why China and Russia took the lead in forming the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO)
a few years ago.
In Europe there is a clear awareness that the U.S. payments deficit is much
larger than just the trade deficit.
The deficit does not stem merely from consumers
buying more imports than the United States exports as the financial sector
de-industrializes its economy. U.S. imports are now plunging as the economy
shrinks and consumers are finding themselves obliged to pay down the debts
they have taken on.
Congress has told foreign investors in the largest dollar holder, China, not
to buy anything except perhaps used-car dealerships and maybe more packaged
mortgages and Fannie Mae stock. This is the equivalent of Japanese investors
being steered into spending one billion dollars for the Rockefeller Center,
on which they subsequently took a one hundred percent loss, and Saudi
investment in Citigroup.
Thats the kind of "international equilibrium"
that U.S. officials love to see. "CNOOC go home" is the motto when it comes
to serious attempts by foreign governments and their sovereign wealth funds
(central bank departments trying to figure out what to do with their dollar
glut) to make direct investments in American industry.
So we are left with the extent to which the U.S. payments deficit stems from
military spending. The problem is not only the war in Iraq, now being
extended to Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is the expensive build-up of U.S.
military bases in Asian, European, post-Soviet and Third World countries.
The Obama administration has promised to make the actual amount of this
military spending more transparent.
That presumably means publishing a revised set
of balance of payments figures as well as domestic federal budget
statistics.
The military overhead is much like a debt overhead, extracting revenue from
the economy. In this case it is to pay the military-industrial complex, not
merely Wall Street banks and other financial institutions. The domestic
federal budget deficit does not stem only from "priming the pump" to give
away enormous sums to create a new financial oligarchy; it contains an
enormous and rapidly growing military component.
So Europeans and Asians see U.S. companies pumping more and more dollars
into their economies, not only to buy their exports in excess of providing
them with goods and services in return, and not only to buy their companies
and "commanding heights" of privatized public enterprises without giving
them reciprocal rights to buy important U.S. companies (remember the U.S.
turn-down of Chinas attempt to buy into the U.S. oil distribution
business), and not only to buy foreign stocks, bonds and real estate.
The U.S. media somehow neglects to mention that
the U.S. Government is spending hundreds of billions of dollars abroad, not
only in the Near East for direct combat, but to build enormous military
bases to encircle the rest of the world, to install radar systems, guided
missile systems and other forms of military coercion, including the "color
revolutions" that have been funded and are still being funded all around the
former Soviet Union.
Pallets of shrink-wrapped hundred-dollar bills,
adding up to tens of millions of dollars at a time, have become familiar
"visuals" on some TV broadcasts, but the link is not made with U.S. military
and diplomatic spending and foreign central-bank dollar holdings, which are
reported simply as "wonderful faith in the U.S. economic recovery" and
presumably the "monetary magic" being worked by Wall Streets Tim
Geithner at Treasury and "Helicopter Ben" Bernanke at the
Federal Reserve.
Heres the problem:
The Coca-Cola Company recently tried to buy
Chinas largest fruit-juice producer and distributor.
China already holds nearly two trillion
dollars in U.S. securities, way more than it needs or can use, inasmuch
as the United States government refuses to let it buy meaningful U.S.
companies.
If the U.S. buyout would have been permitted
to go through, this would have confronted China with a dilemma:
-
Choice #1 would be to let the sale go
through and accept payment in dollars, reinvesting them in what the
U.S. Treasury tells it to do. With U.S. Treasury bonds yielding
about one percent, China would take a capital loss on these when
U.S. interest rates rise or when the dollar declines, as the United
States alone is pursuing expansionary Keynesian policies in an
attempt to enable the U.S. economy to carry its debt overhead.
-
Choice #2 is not to recycle the dollar
inflows. This would lead
the Renminbi to rise against the dollar,
thereby eroding Chinas export competitiveness in world markets.
So China chose a third way, which brought U.S.
protests.
It turned the sale of its tangible company for
merely "paper" U.S. dollars, which went with the "choice" to fund further
U.S. military encirclement of the SCO. The only people who seem not to be
drawing this connection are the American mass media, and hence U.S. public
opinion. I can assure you from personal experience, it is being drawn in
Europe.
(Heres a good diplomatic question to discuss:
Which will be the first European country besides Russia to join the SCO?)
Academic textbooks have nothing to say about how "equilibrium" in foreign
capital movements, speculative as well as for direct investment, is infinite
as far as the U.S. economy is concerned.
The U.S. economy can create
dollars freely, now that they no longer are convertible into gold
or even into purchases of U.S. companies, inasmuch as America remains the
worlds most protected economy.
It alone is permitted to protect its agriculture
by import quotas, having "grandfathered" these into world trade rules half a
century ago. Congress refuses to let "sovereign wealth" funds invest in
important U.S. sectors.
So we are confronted with the fact that the U.S. Treasury prefers foreign
central banks to keep on funding its domestic budget deficit, which means
financing the cost of Americas war in the Near East and encirclement of
foreign countries with rings of military bases.
The more "capital outflows" U.S. investors spend
to buy up foreign economies most profitable sectors, where the new U.S.
owners can extract the highest monopoly rents, the more funds end up in
foreign central banks to support Americas global military build-up. No
textbook on political theory or international relations has suggested axioms
to explain how nations act in a way so adverse to their own political,
military and economic interests.
Yet this is just what has been happening for the
past generation.
