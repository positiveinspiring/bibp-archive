President
Barack
Obama is currently blocking the release - or allowing the CIA
to block the release - of a comprehensive Senate report on the use of
torture by the
George W. Bush administration CIA that
is said to conclude that torture was not an effective or reliable method of
interrogation and that the agency repeatedly misled the White House, the
Justice Department, and Congress about its interrogation efforts.
Initiated by Senate Intelligence Committee Chair
Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-West Virginia) and continued by Sen.
Dianne Feinstein (D-California) when she succeeded him in 2009, the
Senate torture probe entailed about six years of work and the review of 6
million pages of documents.
In December 2012, the committee voted out the
report on a mostly party line vote.
Since that time, the report has been stuck in
limbo at the CIA, with Director
John Brennan refusing to state when his review will be complete, and
reports indicating that the agency intends to write a rebuttal and oppose
public release of the report.
Although the report validates anti-torture
positions taken by Democrats, including President Obama, during the Bush
years, Obama may be delaying its release over concerns about shedding
negative light on his own, related, anti-terror policies that offend human
rights, such as the continued use of torture at Guantánamo Bay or the
predator drone assassination program.
Further, the deep involvement of Obama's
hand-picked CIA Director, John Brennan, in the Bush-era torture and
kidnapping programs may call Obamas judgment about Brennan into question.
On the issue of torture at Guantánamo, the Obama
White House claimed in 2009 that the President had canceled all Bush-era
legal memos purporting to justify the use of enhanced interrogation
techniques not authorized by the Army Field Manual.
The President did not, however, cancel an
April 13, 2006, memo regarding the 2006 revision of the Army Field
Manual and its controversial Appendix M on interrogation.
That memo justifies the use of isolation, sleep
deprivation, and forms of sensory deprivation that have been denounced as
torture or
abuse
by a number of human rights and legal groups - and which sparked the ongoing
hunger strike at Guantánamo.
Obama may be concerned about the impact release
of the report might have on his predator drone targeted assassination
program.
In 2009, the Obama administration successfully
persuaded the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York to overrule a
trial judges ruling ordering release of a September 17, 2001,
presidential directive that established a wide range of anti-terror
efforts, including the use of torture.
Why Obama went to such great lengths to keep the
directive secret may have been revealed by the
appeals court opinion, which stated that,
the withheld information pertains to
intelligence activities unrelated to the discontinued [torture]
program, including targeted killings of suspected al-Qaeda operatives.
