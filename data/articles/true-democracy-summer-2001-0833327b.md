Gehlen, the Nazi, and the CIA
General Gehlen had been the Nazi head of intelligence in the Soviet Union.
In May 1945, he surrendered, along with his archives, to the U.S. He was
presented to Major-General Luther Sibert, head of intelligence for General
Bradley's armies. At Sibert's request, Gehlen the Nazi wrote a
129-page report. Thereafter, Gehlen 'developed his great scheme of
a secret organisation engaged on intelligence work against the Soviet Union
under American aegis.'
Ibid. , p. 122.
Gehlen was introduced to the highest U.S. military authorities and, when
Soviet representatives asked about the whereabouts of Gehlen and Schellenberg,
two war criminals who should have been returned to them, the U.S. replied
that they had no news of them. On August 22, 1945, they clandestinely brought
Gehlen to the U.S.
Ibid. , p. 125.
Gehlen the Nazi `negotiated' with the leaders of U.S. intelligence,
including Allen Dulles, and they came up with an 'agreeement': Gehlen's
spy organization would continue to serve in the Soviet Union, autonomously,
and `Liaison with American Intelligence would be maintained by US officers'.
Furthermore, the 'Gehlen Organisation would be used solely to procure
intelligence on the Soviet Union and satellite countries of the communist
bloc.'
Ibid. , p. 135.
On July 9, 1946, Gehlen was back in Germany to reactivate his Nazi
spy service, under U.S. leadership. He hired dozens of upper Gestapo and
SS officers, to whom he furnished false identities.
Ibid. , pp. 144--145.
John Loftus, former U.S. intelligence officer responsible for the
tracking down of former Nazis at the end of the war, noted that thousands
of Ukrainian, Croatian and Hungarian fascists were snuck into the U.S. by
a 'rival' intelligence service. Loftus writes:
'According to one estimate, some 10,000 Nazi war criminals entered the United
States after World War II.'
Mark Aarons and John Loftus, Ratlines: How the Vatican's
Nazi networks betrayed Western intelligence to the Soviets (London: Heinemann,
1991), pp. 269--270.
Right from 1947, when the U.S. started up the Cold War, these 'former' Nazis
played an important role in the anti-Communist propaganda. So we can correctly
claim that U.S. imperialism was the direct continuation of Nazi expansionism.
