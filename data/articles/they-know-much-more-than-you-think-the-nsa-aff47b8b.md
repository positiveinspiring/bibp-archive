The headquarters of
the National Security Agency, Fort Meade, Maryland
In mid-May, Edward Snowden, an American in his late twenties, walked
through the onyx entrance of the Mira Hotel on Nathan Road in Hong Kong and
checked in.
He was pulling a small black travel bag and had
a number of laptop cases draped over his shoulders. Inside those cases were
four computers packed with some of his countrys most closely held secrets.
Within days of Snowdens documents appearing in The Guardian and The
Washington Post, revealing several of the National Security Agencys
extensive domestic surveillance programs, bookstores reported a sudden spike
in the sales of George Orwells classic dystopian novel
1984.
On Amazon.com, the book made the "Movers &
Shakers" list and skyrocketed 6,021 percent in a single day.
Written sixty-five years ago, it described a
fictitious totalitarian society where a shadowy leader known as "Big
Brother" controls his population through invasive surveillance.
"The telescreens," Orwell wrote, "have hidden microphones and cameras. These
devices, alongside informers, permit the Thought Police to spy upon
everyone
"
Today, as the Snowden documents make clear, it is the NSA that keeps track
of phone calls, monitors communications, and analyzes peoples thoughts
through data mining of Google searches and other online activity.
"Any sound that Winston made, above the
level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it," Orwell wrote
about his protagonist, Winston Smith.
There was of course no way of knowing whether
you were being watched at any given moment.
How often, or on what system, the Thought Police
plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable
that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in
your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live - did live, from habit
that became instinct - in the assumption that every sound you made was
overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.
Of course the US is not a totalitarian society, and no equivalent of Big
Brother runs it, as the widespread reporting of Snowdens information shows.
We know little about what uses the NSA makes of most information available
to it - it claims to have exposed a number of terrorist plots - and it has
yet to be shown what effects its activities may have on the lives of most
American citizens.
Congressional committees and a special federal
court are charged with overseeing its work, although they are committed to
secrecy, and the court can hear appeals only from the government.
Still, the US intelligence agencies also seem to have adopted Orwells idea
of doublethink...
"to be conscious of complete
truthfulness," he wrote, "while telling carefully constructed lies."
For example, James Clapper, the director
of national intelligence, was asked at a Senate hearing in March whether,
"the NSA collect[s] any type of data at all
on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans."
Clappers answer: "No, sir
. Not wittingly."
Three months later, following the revelations of
the phone-log program in which the NSA collects telephone data - the numbers
of both callers and the length of the calls - on hundreds of millions of
Americans, Clapper switched to doublethink.
He said that his previous answer was not a lie;
he just chose to respond in the "least untruthful manner."
With such an
Orwellian concept of the truth now being used, it is useful to take a look
at what the government has been telling the public about its surveillance
activities over the years, and compare it with what we know now as a result
of the top secret documents and other information released by, among others,
the former NSA contract employee Edward Snowden.
Looking back, the NSA and its predecessors have been gaining secret, illegal
access to the communications of Americans for nearly a century. On July 1,
1920, a slim balding man in his early thirties moved into a four-story
townhouse at 141 East 37th Street in Manhattan.
This was the birth of the
Black Chamber, the NSAs earliest predecessor, and it would be hidden in the
nondescript brownstone.
But its chief, Herbert O. Yardley, had a
problem. To gather intelligence for Woodrow Wilsons government, he needed
access to the telegrams entering, leaving, and passing through the country,
but because of an early version of the Radio Communications Act, such access
was illegal.
With the shake of a hand, however, Yardley convinced Newcomb
Carlton, the president of Western Union, to grant the Black Chamber secret
access on a daily basis to the private messages passing over his wires - the
Internet of the day.
For much of the next century, the solution would be the same: the NSA and
its predecessors would enter into secret illegal agreements with the telecom
companies to gain access to communications. Eventually codenamed
Project
Shamrock, the program finally came to a crashing halt in 1975 when a Senate
committee that was investigating intelligence agency abuses discovered it.
Senator Frank Church, the committee chairman, labeled the NSA program,
"probably the largest governmental
interception program affecting Americans ever undertaken."
As a result of the decades of illegal surveillance by the NSA, in 1978 the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was signed into law and the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) came into existence. Its
purpose was, for the first time, to require the NSA to get judicial approval
for eavesdropping on Americans.
Although the court seldom turned down a
request for a warrant, or an order as its called, it nevertheless served as
a reasonable safeguard, protecting the American public from an agency with a
troubling past and a tendency to push the bounds of spying unless checked.
For a quarter of a century, the rules were followed and the NSA stayed out
of trouble, but following the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration
decided to illegally bypass the court and began its program of warrantless
wiretapping.
"Basically all rules were thrown out the window and they would
use any excuse to justify a waiver to spy on Americans," I was told by
Adrienne J. Kinne, who in 2001 was a twenty-four-year-old voice intercept
operator who conducted some of the eavesdropping.
She or her superiors did
not have to get a warrant for each interception.
"It was incredibly
uncomfortable to be listening to private personal conversations of
Americans," she said. "And its almost like going through and stumbling and
finding somebodys diary and reading it."
All during this time, however,
the
Bush administration was telling the
American public the opposite: that a warrant was obtained whenever an
American was targeted.
"Anytime you hear the United States government
talking about a wiretap, it requires - a wiretap requires a court order,"
President George W. Bush told a crowd in 2004.
"Nothing has changed, by the
way. When were talking about chasing down terrorists, were talking about
getting a court order before we do so."
After exposure of the operation by
The New York Times in 2005, however, rather than strengthen the controls
governing the NSAs spying, Congress instead voted to weaken them, largely
by codifying into the amendment to FISA what had previously been illegal.
At the same time, rather than calling for prosecution of the telecom
officials for their role in illegally cooperating in the eavesdropping
program, or at least a clear public accounting, Congress simply granted them
immunity not only from prosecution but also from civil suits.
Thus, for
nearly a century, telecom companies have been allowed to violate the privacy
of millions of Americans with impunity.
With the arrival of the Obama administration, the NSAs powers continued to
expand at the same time that administration officials and the NSA continued
to deceive the American public on the extent of the spying. In addition to
the denial I have mentioned by James Clapper, General Keith Alexander, the NSA director, also blatantly denied that his agency was keeping records on
millions of Americans.
In March 2012, Wired magazine published a cover story
I wrote on the new one-million-square-foot NSA data center being built in
Bluffdale, Utah.
In the article, I interviewed William Binney, a former
high-ranking NSA official who was largely responsible for automating the
agencys worldwide eavesdropping network. He quit the agency in 2001 in
protest after he saw the system designed mainly for intelligence about
foreign threats turned inward on the American public.
In the interview, he
told how the agency was tapping into the countrys communications and
Internet networks. He revealed that it also was secretly obtaining
warrantless access to billions of phone records of Americans, including
those of both AT&T and Verizon.
"Theyre storing everything they gather," he
said.
In the months afterward, General Alexander repeatedly denied Binneys
charges.
"No
we dont hold data on US citizens," he told Fox News, and at an
Aspen Institute conference he said, "To think were collecting on every US
person
that would be against the law."
He added,
"The fact is were a foreign intelligence
agency."
But the documents released by
Edward Snowden show that the NSA does have a
large-scale program to gather the telephone records of every Verizon
customer, including local calls, and presumably a similar agreement with
AT&T and other companies.
These are records of who called whom and when, not
of the content of the conversations, although the NSA has, by other methods,
access to the content of conversations as well. But the NSA has, on a daily
basis, access to virtually everyones phone records, whether cell or
landline, and can store, data-mine, and keep them indefinitely.
Snowdens
documents describing
the PRISM program show that the agency is also
accessing the Internet data of the nine major Internet companies in the US,
including Google and Yahoo.
Snowdens documents and statements add greatly to an understanding of just
how the NSA goes about conducting its eavesdropping and data-mining
programs, and just how deceptive the NSA and
the Obama administration have
been in describing the agencys activities to the American public.
In a
video interview conducted in his room in the Mira Hotel, Snowden elaborated
on the extent of the NSAs capabilities.
"Any analyst at any time can target
anyone, any selector, anywhere," he said.
Where those communications will be picked up depends on the range of the
sensor networks and the authorities that that analyst is empowered with.
Not
all analysts have the ability to target everything. But I sitting at my desk
certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant
to a federal judge to even the president, if I had a personal e-mail
[address].
What Snowden was discussing was the way in which analysts at the NSA can
place such things as names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses on target
lists, thus causing communications containing those "selectors" to be
intercepted.
He seemed to be indicating - although this remains to be
officially confirmed - that while
under FISA, a court order would be
required to enter an American on a target list, analysts have the capability
to unilaterally bypass the procedure by simply listing a name or e-mail
address on the target list.
To understand what Snowden is saying, it is
necessary to elaborate a bit on the way the NSA conducts its eavesdropping.
Drawing by Edward Gorey
During the past decade, the NSA has secretly worked to gain access to
virtually all communications entering, leaving, or going through the
country.
A key reason, according to the draft of a top secret NSA inspector
generals report leaked by Snowden, is that approximately one third of all
international telephone calls in the world enter, leave, or transit the
United States.
"Most international telephone calls are routed through a
small number of switches or chokepoints in the international telephone
switching system en route to their final destination," says the report.
"The
United States is a major crossroads for international switched telephone
traffic."
At the same time, according to the 2009 report, virtually all
Internet communications in the world pass through the US.
For example, the
report notes that during 2002, less than one percent of worldwide Internet
bandwidth - i.e., the international link between the Internet and computers
- "was between two regions that did not include the United States."
Accessing this data is possible through a combination of techniques.
Through
the most effective of them, the NSA can gain direct access to the
fiber-optic cables that now carry most kinds of communications data.
According to a slide released by Snowden, the cable-tapping operation is
codenamed "UPSTREAM" and it is described as the,
"collection of
communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past."
It
also appears to be both far more secret and far more invasive than the PRISM
program revealed by Snowden.
Although PRISM gives the NSA access to data
from the individual Internet companies, such as Yahoo, Google, and
Microsoft, the companies claim that they dont give the agency direct access
to their servers. Through UPSTREAM, however, the agency does get direct
access to fiber-optic cables and the supporting infrastructure that carries
nearly all the Internet and telephone traffic in the country.
As part of its cable-tapping program, the NSA has secretly installed what
amount to computerized filters on the telecommunications infrastructure
throughout the country.
According to the leaked inspector generals report,
the agency has secret cooperative agreements with the top three telephone
companies in the country. Although the report disguises their names, they
are likely AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint:
NSA determined that under the Authorization it could gain access to
approximately 81% of the international calls into and out of the United
States through three corporate partners: Company A had access to 39%,
Company B 28%, and Company C 14%.
The filters are placed at key junction points known as switches. For
example, much of the communications - telephone and Internet - to and from
the northwestern United States pass through a nearly windowless nine-story
building at 611 Folsom Street in San Francisco. This is AT&Ts regional
switching center.
In 2003, the NSA built a secret room in the facility and
filled it with computers and software from a company called Narus.
Established in Israel by Israelis, and now owned by Boeing, Narus
specializes in spyware, equipment that examines both the metadata - the
names and addresses of people communicating on the Internet - and the
content of digital traffic such as e-mail as it zooms past at the speed of
light.
The agency also has access to the telephone metadata - the numbers called
and calling and other details - of all Americans. Phone calls from telephone
numbers that have been selected as targets can be routed directly to the
agency and recorded.
According to William Binney, the former NSA senior
official, the NSA has established between ten and twenty of these secret
rooms at telecom company switches around the country.
It is this daily access to the telephone metadata of all Americans without
FISA warrants that the NSA and the Office of National Intelligence tried to
hide when they falsely denied that the agency had surveillance records on
millions of Americans. For years, the agency also had a nationwide bulk
e-mail and Internet metadata collection and storage program, although that
was ended in 2011 for "operational and resource reasons," according to the
director of national intelligence.
But according to a joint statement issued on July 2 by senators Ron Wyden
and Mark Udall, the real reason the program was shut down was that the NSA
was "unable" to prove the usefulness of the operation.
"We were very
concerned about this programs impact on Americans civil liberties and
privacy rights," they said, "and we spent a significant portion of 2011
pressing intelligence officials to provide evidence of its effectiveness.
They were unable to do so, and the program was shut down that year."
The
senators added,
"It is also important to note that
intelligence agencies made statements to both Congress and the [FISA
court] that significantly exaggerated this programs effectiveness.
This experience demonstrates to us that
intelligence agencies assessment of the usefulness of particular
collection program - even significant ones - are not always accurate."
Speaking on Meet the Press,
Glenn Greenwald, a lawyer and journalist who
wrote the story about the NSAs collection of phone data for The Guardian,
also mentioned a still-secret eighty-page FISA court opinion that, he said,
criticized the NSA for violation of both the Fourth Amendment and the FISA
statute.
According to Greenwald,
"it specifically said that they are
collecting bulk transmissions, multiple conversations from millions of
Americans
and that this is illegal."
The NSA, he said,
"planned to try to
accommodate that ruling."
On the same program, Representative Mike Rogers,
Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, confirmed that the
FISA court had issued a critical opinion and said that the NSA had "figured
out how to correct that."
According to The Economist of June 29,
"the NSA provided congressional
intelligence committees with what it said were over 50 cases in which the
programs disclosed by Mr. Snowden had contributed to the understanding
and, in many cases, disruption of terrorist plots in America, and over 20
other countries."
In a recent New York Review blog post, Kenneth Roth,
director of Human Rights Watch and a former federal prosecutor, commented
that "upon scrutiny" many of the plots referred to by the NSA
appear in fact to have been uncovered not because of the mass collection of
our metadata but through more traditional surveillance of particular phone
numbers or e-mail addresses - the kinds of targeted inquiries that easily
would have justified a judicial order allowing review of records kept by
communications companies or even monitoring the content of those
communications.
At the AT&T facility on Folsom Street and the other locations, fiber-optic
cables containing millions of communications enter the building and go into
whats known as a beam-splitter.
This is a prism-type device that produces a
duplicate, mirror image of the original communications.
The original beams,
containing Internet data, continue on to wherever they were originally
destined. The duplicate beam goes into Room 641A, the NSAs secret room one
floor below, a discovery made by another whistleblower, AT&T technician Mark
Klein.
There the
Narus equipment scans all the Internet traffic for
"selectors" - names, e-mail address, words, phrases, or other indicators
that the NSA wants to know about. Any message containing a selector is then
retransmitted in full to the NSA for further analysis, as are the contents
of phone calls selected. With regard to targeted phone numbers, the agency
supplies them to the company, which then gives the NSA access to monitor
them.
The selectors are inserted by remote control into the Narus equipment by NSA
analysts sitting at their desks at the agencys headquarters at Fort Meade
in Maryland or at dozens of locations around the world.
What Snowden seemed
to be saying in his interview is that as long as certain analysts have an
e-mail address, for example, they can simply enter that information into the
system and retrieve the content of the e-mails sent from and to that
address.
There are, by his account, no judicial checks and balances to
assure that the targeting of an American has been approved by a FISA court
order and not just by NSA employees. These claims by Snowden, and other
revelations from the documents he released, should be investigated by either
a select committee of Congress, such as the Church Committee, or an
independent body, like the 9/11 Commission.
While UPSTREAM captures most of the telecommunications - about 80 percent
according to Binney - there are still gaps in the coverage.
That is where
the PRISM program comes in. With PRISM, the NSA is able to go directly to
the communications industry, including the major Internet companies, to get
whatever they miss from UPSTREAM.
According to the top secret inspector
generals report, the,
"NSA maintains relationships with over 100 US
companies," adding that the US has the "home field advantage as the primary
hub for worldwide telecommunications."
According to a recent slide released by Snowden, the NSA on April 5, 2013,
had 117,675 active surveillance targets in the program and was able to
access real-time data on live voice, text, e-mail, or Internet chat
services, in addition to analyzing stored data.
In the end, both UPSTREAM and PRISM may be only the tips of a much larger
system.
Another new document released by Snowden says that on New Years
Eve, 2012, SHELLTRUMPET, a metadata program targeting international
communications, had just "processed its One Trillionth metadata record."
Started five years ago, it noted that half of that trillion was added in
2012. It also noted that two more new programs, MOONLIGHTPATH and SPINNERET,
"are planned to be added by September 2013."
One man who was prescient enough to see what was coming was Senator Frank
Church, the first outsider to peer into the dark recesses of the NSA.
In
1975, when the NSA posed merely a fraction of the threat to privacy it poses
today with UPSTREAM, PRISM, and thousands of other collection and
data-mining programs, Church issued a stark warning:
That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people
and no American would have any privacy left, such [is] the capability to
monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesnt matter.
There would be no place to hide.
If this government ever became a tyranny,
if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity
that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to
impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back, because the
most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no
matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to
know.
Such is the capability of this technology
I dont want to see this
country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make
tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all
agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under
proper supervision, so that we never cross over that abyss.
That is the
abyss from which there is no return.
Church sounds as if he had absorbed the lessons of 1984.
From the recent
evidence, they are still to be learned.
