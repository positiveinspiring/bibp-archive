In her book Water Wars,
the Indian author
Vandana Shiva lists nine principles
underpinning water democracy. At least two of these principles are directly
compromised by the privatization of water.
Point number four states
that,
Water must be free for
sustenance needs. Since nature gives water to us free of cost, buying
and selling it for profit violates our inherent right to nature's gift
and denies the poor of their human rights.
When private companies try to
make large profits through high water prices, it denies the poor the
inalienable right to the most necessary substance for life. In accordance
with this fact, point number seven states,
Water is a commons... It
cannot be owned as private property and sold as a commodity.
How can one justify claiming
water as their own through contractual agreement while letting another human
being go thirsty?
Water is a commons because it is the basis of all life.
Water rights are natural rights and thus are usufructuary rights, meaning
that water can be used, but not owned. As far fetched as water ownership may
seem, it is happening at an increasing rate around the globe.
Currently there is a rush to privatize water services around the world. The
World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) are
pushing for the
privatization of water services by European
and U.S.-based companies.
They are pushing privatization through
stipulations in trade agreements and loan conditions to developing
countries.
These privatization programs
started in the early 1990s and have since emerged in India,
Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Nigeria, Mexico,
Malaysia, Australia, and the Philippines, to name a
few.
In Chile, the World Bank
imposed a loan condition to guarantee a 33 percent profit margin to the
French company Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux while the company insisted on
a margin of 35 percent.
This privatization of services is only the first step toward the
privatization of all aspects of water. Through this new globalization and
privatization of water resources, there is an effort to replace collective
ownership of water sources with corporate control. This effort is being met
with increasing opposition.
Supporters of privatization
say that it has a great track record of success, increasing the efficiency,
quality, reliability and affordability of services to the population.
Yet the industry has a track
record of hazards and failures. For example, private companies most often
violate standards of operation, and engage in price fixing without many
consequences.
This leads to water stress
among the poor populations of these areas, causing people to drink water
that is often very contaminated and hazardous to their health (even though
case studies have shown that privatized water can be very contaminated as
well).
Rising Prices and
Deteriorating Water Quality
-
Australia - In 1998,
the water in Sydney, was contaminated with high levels of giardia
and cryptosporidium shortly after its water was overtaken by
Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux.
-
Canada - At least
seven people died as a result of E. coli bacteria in Walkerton,
Ontario, after water testing had been privatized by A&L Labs. The
company treated the test results as "confidential intellectual
property" and did not make them public.
-
Morocco - Consumers
saw the price of water increase threefold after the water service
was privatized in Casablanca.
-
Argentina - When a
Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux subsidiary purchased the state-run water
company Obras Sanitarias de la Nacion, water rates doubled but water
quality deteriorated. The company was forced to leave the country
when residents refused to pay their bills.
-
Britain - Water and
sewage bills increased 67 percent between 1989 and 1995. The rate at
which people's services were disconnected rose by 177 percent.
-
New Zealand -
Citizens took to the streets to protest the commercialization of
water.
-
South Africa - Water
became inaccessible, unaffordable, and unsafe after the water supply
was privatized by Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux in Johannesburg. Cholera
infections became widespread and thousands of people were
disconnected from their supply of water.
As is already evident, once
these private water giants take over water services, prices skyrocket.
After
privatization, customer fees in France increased 150 percent while the water
quality declined. In a French government report, it was revealed that over
5.2 million people had received bacterially unacceptable water.
In Subic Bay, a former U.S.
naval base in the Philippines, Biwater increased water rates by 400 percent.
Water rates in England increased by 450 percent while company profits soared
by 692 percent. CEO salaries for the private corporations behind the water
supply increased by an astonishing 708 percent. As one can expect with such
high price fixing, service disconnection increased by 50 percent.
Meanwhile, the British
Medical Association condemned water privatization for its health effects
because dysentery increased six-fold. Many of these examples of the failures
of water privatization are occurring in developed countries, but the most
severe effects have been on the developing world.
The high rises in pricing
along with deteriorating water quality because of water privatization has
led to much public scrutiny and uprisings by affected communities around the
world.
Bechtel in Cochabamba,
Bolivia
Probably the most well known example of the global conflict over water
privatization is the case of Cochabamba, Bolivia.
It is a shining
example of the conflict over the privatization of water services, a victory
for the people opposing privatization, and the persistence of the water
giants to make money any way they can. Cochabamba lies in a semidesert
region of Bolivia, making water a scarce and precious resource.
However, in 1999 the World
Bank recommended privatization of Cochabamba's municipal water supply
company, Servicio Municipal del Agua Potable y Alcantarillado (SENIAPA).
"Bank officials directly
threatened to withhold $600 million in international debt relief if
Bolivia didn't privatize Cochabamba's public water system."
http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=14525
This was to be done through a
concession to one of Bechtels subsidiaries - International Water.
Bechtel
is a U.S. corporation based in San Francisco. This corporate giant is not
even welcome in its hometown of San Francisco. In June, 2002 the Board of
Supervisors in San Francisco voted to cancel a $45 million program
management contract awarded to Bechtel for the reconstruction of the Hetch
Hetchy public water system.
This vote took place after an
investigation by the San Francisco Bay Guardian, a local alternative weekly
newspaper, exposed that at least $5 million dollars of nearly $8 million
pay out to Bechtel for its first year of service was a complete waste of
money.
In one case, Bechtel took a city database of projects, resorted the
information, changed the data into a different format, and sold it back to
the city for almost $500,000.
In response to the World Bank recommendation, the Bolivian Congress passed
the Drinking Water and Sanitation Law in October 1999, allowing
privatization and ending government subsidies to municipal utilities.
Soon
after International Water took over the water services in Cochabamba, the
monthly water bill reached $20 in a city where the minimum wage is less than
$100 a month. These increases forced some of the poorest families in to
literally choose between food and water ($20 is nearly the cost of feeding a
family of five for two weeks).
For more information on the
these price hikes, see
HERE.
In response to these price increases,
an alliance of the citizens of Cochabamba called La Coordinadora de
Defensa del Agua y de la Vida (The Coalition in Defense of Water and
Life) was formed in January 2000. Through mass mobilization, the alliance
shut down the city for four days. Within a month of this, millions of
Bolivians marched to Cochabamba and held a general strike, stopping
all transportation.
The protesters then issued
the Cochabamba Declaration, which called for the protection of
universal water rights for all citizens.
In response to this, the
Bolivian government promised to reverse the price hike. They never did.
So,
in February 2000, La Coordinadora organized a peaceful march demanding the
retraction of the Drinking Water and Sanitation Law, the termination of the
water contract, the participation of citizens in creating a water resource
law, and the cancellation of ordinances allowing privatization.
Slogans such as "Water Is
God's Gift and Not A Merchandise" and "Water Is Life" were used by the
protesters. These demands were strongly rejected by the government. The
following April, the government declared martial law to try and silence the
water protests. Activists were arrested, protesters were killed, and the
media was censored.
After only a day of martial
law, three protesters had been killed, including a 17-year old boy who was
shot in the head by soldiers in Cochabamba. Over 30 people had been injured
through conflicts with the military and the leaders had been jailed (some
were flown to a remote location in the jungle of Bolivia).
The people finally won on April 10, 2000 when Aguas del Tunari and Bechtel
left Bolivia and the government was forced to revoke its water privatization
legislation. The water company Servico Municipal del Aqua Potable y
Alcantarillado (SEMAPO) along with the debts, was handed over to the workers
and the people.
In the summer of 2000, La Coordinadora held public hearings to start democratic planning and
management. However, the Bolivian government and Bechtel continued to harass
and threaten activists of La Coordinadora, trying their best to undermine
the process.
In November 2001, Bechtel filed a lawsuit against Bolivia,
demanding $25 million in compensation for its lost opportunity for future
profits.
Currently, this lawsuit is being heard by the International Center for the
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an international tribunal housed
at the World Bank in Washington DC, that holds all of its meetings in
private. Bechtel was able to file the case with ICSD under a Bilateral
Investment Treaty (BIT) between the Netherlands and Bolivia.
Even though Bechtel is a U.S.
corporation, its subsidiary founded a presence in the Netherlands in order
to exploit this treaty.
Because of the secrecy of the hearings, the Center
for International Environmental Law and Earth justice filed a request in
August 2002 to open these proceedings to the public of Bolivia. However, in
February 2003 the ICSD sided with Bechtel, announcing that it would not
allow the media or public to have any part in or even witness the meetings.
Not only is the World Bank
forcing its programs and ideas on the people of Bolivia, but it is also
preventing the affected people from participating in a matter that directly
affects their lives.
As of May 2004, there has been no verdict on the
lawsuit.
Bechtel in the new
Iraq
Today, Bechtel is spreading its water privatization elsewhere, aided by war.
Within a month after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Bechtel acquired a $680
million contract for rebuilding Iraq.
As Vandana Shiva writes in
her article
Bechtel And Blood For Water: War As An Excuse For Enlarging
Corporate Rule,
The U.S. led war first
bombed out Iraq's hospitals, bridges, water works, and now U.S.
corporations are harvesting profits from 'reconstructing' a society
after its deliberate destruction.
Blood was not just shed for oil, but
also for control over water and other vital services... war has become
a convenient excuse for enlarging corporate rule. If W.T.O. is not
enough, use war.
George Shultz was Secretary
of State under Ronald Reagan and previously was the president of Bechtel. He
is now a board member and senior counselor for the corporation.
He was chairman of the
pro-war Committee for the Liberation of Iraq and wrote in a op-ed article in
the Washington Post September 2002 that,
A strong foundation
exists for immediate military action against Hussein and for a
multilateral effort to rebuild Iraq after he is gone."
Because Bechtel is a
privately held company, without public stock trading, it does not have to
reveal many of its operations.
Bechtel is responsible for
over 19,000 projects in 140 countries on all continents, and is involved in
over 200 water and wastewater treatment plants around the world. It was
involved in the Dabhol plant in India with Enron, and is now involved in water privatization of Coimbatore/Tirrupur as part of a consortium with Mahindra and Mahindra, United International North West Water.
The contract has not yet been
made public, as is the case with other privatization contracts.
Conclusion
The rush to privatize water continues unencumbered, despite its unpopularity
among residents worldwide who are affected by it. Countries faced with large
debts are forced by the World Bank and IMF to privatize water . Water
deregulation is a common demand of the World Bank and IMF as part of their
loan conditions.
In 2000, out of 40 IMF loans distributed through the
International Finance Corporation, 12 had requirements of partial or full
privatization of water supplies. They also insisted on the creation of
policies to stimulate full cost recovery and the elimination of subsidies.
African governments, such as
Ghana, increasingly give in to pressures for water privatization. In Ghana,
the World Bank and IMF policies forced the sale of water at market rate,
requiring the poor to spend up to 50 percent of their earnings on water
purchases.
As Vandana Shiva writes in
Water Wars,
The water crisis is the
most pervasive, most severe, and most invisible dimension of the
ecological devastation of the earth.
