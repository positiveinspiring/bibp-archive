Our defensive
power has been created on the basis of our defensive strategy
and the
presumption ruling our defensive strategy is that
we will enter an massive
battle with a U.S.-led coalition.
Brigadier General Hossein Salami
IRGC Deputy Commander
September 2012
Both the U.S. and Israel have threatened to
implement a preemptive first strike attack against Iran, the consequences of
which would be devastating.
Responding to these ongoing threats, Irans
Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) General Amir Ali Hajizadeh has warned that a
U.S.-Israeli military attack against Iran could
lead to the outbreak of a Third World War. He also intimated that Israel
cannot launch a war without the green-light from the U.S..
If such a war were to be launched, according to
General Hajizadeh, a scenario of uncontrolled military escalation is likely
to occur.
If attacked, Iran would retaliate against both
Israeli and U.S. targets including U.S. military facilities in neighboring
countries (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gulf States):
Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps
(IRGC) Aerospace Force General Amir Ali Hajizadeh warned the U.S. and the
Zionist regime [Israel] that an attack on Iran will likely trigger World War
III.
Speaking to the Arabic news network, Al-Alam
on Sunday, General Hajizadeh said the
U.S. and the Israeli regime
may not enter war with Iran,
independent from each other, meaning that
either one of these two starts the war, it will be joined by the other one.
We see the U.S. and the Zionist regime standing
fully on the side of each other and we
cannot imagine the Zionist regime initiating a war without the U.S. backup.
Due to the same reason, if a war breaks out,
we will definitely wage battle on both
sides and will definitely be engaged with the U.S. bases, he said.
In case such conditions arise, a
series of incidents will take place which will not be controllable and
manageable and such a war might turn into a third world war.
That
means, certain countries may enter the war for or against Iran, added the
general.
The IRGC commander warned that in case such war
is waged on Iran, the U.S. bases in,
those
countries around us and inside the neighboring countries will be
targeted and they will even be threatened by the nations of
these very states.

The World is at a dangerous crossroads. The
statement of General Hajizadeh must be taken seriously.
Active war preparations against Iran have been
ongoing for the last eight years. Since 2005, the U.S. and its allies,
including Americas NATO partners and Israel, have been involved in the
extensive deployment and stockpiling of advanced weapons systems.
The air
defense systems of the U.S., NATO member countries and Israel are fully
integrated. Israel cannot act without the support of its allies. This is a coordinated endeavor of the Pentagon,
NATO and Israels Defense Force (IDF) directed against Iran.
Several
non-NATO partner countries including the frontline Arab states (members of
NATOs
Mediterranean Dialogue and the
Istanbul Cooperation Initiative) are also involved.
Media Disinformation
Public opinion, swayed by media hype is tacitly
supportive, indifferent or ignorant as to the likely impacts of what is
upheld as an ad hoc punitive operation directed against Irans nuclear
facilities rather than an all out war.
The war on Iran is presented to public opinion
as an issue among others. It is not viewed as a threat to humanity.
Quite
the opposite: it is viewed as a humanitarian endeavor.
Retaliation
The Western media is beating the drums of war.
The purpose is to tacitly instill, through repeated media reports, ad
nauseam, within peoples inner consciousness, the notion that the Iranian
threat is real and that the Islamic Republic should be taken out.
Iran has significant military capabilities. The
fact that an attack on Iran could lead to retaliation and escalation which
could potentially unleash a global war is not a matter of concern.
While the Islamic Republic does not constitute a
threat to the security of Israel, Irans military brass has emphasized that
in the case of an attack on Iran, retaliation against Israel is
contemplated, with potentially devastating consequences:
On Saturday, IRGCs top Commander Major
General Mohammad Ali Jafari said
an enemy invasion of Iran is possible, but such a war would
put an end to the life of the Zionist regime of Israel.
War may break out, but if Zionists [Israeli
government] start something, that will be the point of their
annihilation and the endpoint of their story, he added.
Jafari, meantime, underlined that
no one dares to wage an extensive ground assault on Iran.
The General said
if the enemy were wise,
there wouldnt be any problem,
but
the problem is that there is no guarantee for this rationality and we
should be prepared too."
Later yesterday, his deputy, Brigadier General
Hossein Salami, cautioned that any possible attack on the Islamic Republic
of Iran by the Zionist regime would provide an opportunity for Tehran to
wipe the regime off the earth.
If the Zionists embark on attacking Iran,
it will provide a historical opportunity for the Islamic Revolution to
wipe them off the worlds geographical history, Salami said on Saturday
night on the state-run TV.
We are now through with concerns about the
Zionist regimes threats, he said, adding that Israel has bitter
memories of its last-decade wars with the regional allies of the Islamic
Republic, including Hezbollah and Hamas Movement.
(Given the above-mentioned failures) how
does it (the Zionist regime) want to be a threat against the Islamic
Republic of Iran? Salami asked.
He, meantime, underlined Irans
preparedness to confront any aggression against the country, and said,
Our
defensive power has been created on the basis of our defensive strategy
and the presumption ruling our defensive strategy is that we will enter
an massive battle with a U.S.-led coalition.
On Friday, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed
Forces Major General Seyed Hassan Firouzabadi also warned that Tehran would
reciprocate any aggression against the country with an immediate and
non-stop response, stressed.
We do not feel threatened by the boastful
remarks of Zionist leaders, because they are creatures with deep fright
who continue crying out since they know that Irans response to threats
will be readymade, immediate and non-stop, Major General Firouzabadi
told reporters on the sidelines of September 21 military parades marking
the anniversary of the Week of Sacred Defense here in Tehran on Friday
morning.
The Zionist regime officials have declared
in their (military) estimates that military operations against Iran
neither can be done by Israel nor is useful for them, he added.
He also stated that Irans armed forces today
are unpredictable and their strategy and actions cannot be foreseen by the
enemies.
The Sacred Defense Week, commemorating Iranians
sacrifices during the 8 years of Iraqi imposed war on Iran in 1980s, started
on Friday with nationwide parades by various units of the Islamic Republic
Army, Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) and Basij (volunteer) forces in
Southern Tehran.

Reverse the Tide of War
We call upon our readers to spread the message
far and wide.
We call upon people across the land, in
America, Western Europe, Israel, Turkey and around the world to rise up
against this military project, against their governments which are
supportive of military action against Iran, against the media which serves
to camouflage the devastating implications of a war against Iran.
The people of Israel are largely united against
Prime Minister Netanyahus resolve to attack Iran.
A protocol of
non-aggression should be reached between Israel and Iran.
