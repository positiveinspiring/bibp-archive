News has just broken about a freedom activist
and former Marine named Brandon Raub, who
was arrested (apparently
without a warrant or being read his rights) on the evening of August 16th.
Details are still coming in, but it appears that
his "crime" was posting things that the overseers didn't like on
Facebook.
As I recount the facts of this horrifying case (as best I am able), please
remember that the violation of this man's natural rights is not the issue I
wish to point out, as ultra-valid as that may be.
WHAT HE DID
From the above link, you can find five articles from Brandon on a
pro-liberty website.
Perhaps we might quibble with these posts on a
few points (I'm for abandoning politics rather than trying to use it, for
example), but it is clear that the young man is thinking along some good
lines.
He also promoted a small freedom march in Richmond, Virginia last November.
It was peaceful and I've seen no problems reported.
So, aside from a picture of him holding an old
rifle, the only thing the overseers had on him were a few recent Facebook
posts:
-
I feel like I am standing at a great
crossroads. As if a storm of destiny is about to pick me up and take
me to fight a great battle. A battle I could have never imagined
existed. 7/24/12
-
We MUST rise up and take our country
back. 7/30/12
-
I am standing against a great evil. I
will do it all by myself if I have to. 8/4/12
-
This is the part where I tell the
Federal Government to go fuck itself. This is the part where I tell
Generals, training our young men to fight Americans, I am coming for
you. The Veterans will be with me. 8/9/12
-
Im starting the Revolution. Im done
waiting. 8/10/12
-
Sharpen up my axe; Im here to sever
heads. 8/13/12
-
The Revolution will come for me. Men
will be at my door soon to pick me up to lead it. 8/14/12
-
The Revolution is here. And I will lead
it. 8/14/12
#6, by the way, seems to be a lyric from a song
called Bring Me Down by a band called Swollen Members.
Several of these sound like rants a lot of us
have had in moments of frustration.
THE POINT
I expect further facts to emerge about Brandon and what has been done to
him, and I expect to see some creative statist media spin.
Regardless of whatever facts emerge, I suspect
that high law enforcers will get the talking heads to reassure the public
that this was done to keep them safe. The obedient onlookers will be given a
reason to ignore the story.
The point I want you to get is that Facebook is the
Department of PreCrime.
Everything you do there (or your friends, family or co-workers do there) is
monitored and may be taken as a valid reason for armed men to grab you and
lock you up.
In order to respond within in a day or two of a post, an entire
infrastructure, including both computing power and manpower, had to be in
place. The overseers are not going to abandon this infrastructure.
Some of us have
warned about this previously, but this is the first time the
results have been seen in public.
There is one fact that I left out above: Brandon was NOT taken to a jail -
he was taken to a mental hospital. That is also a big deal. Forced committal
is a very nasty tactic that was used regularly in the USSR and the other
communist slave states. By declaring someone who opposes the state insane,
you can disappear them, while assuring the want-to-believe public that you
are benevolent and just.
The bottom line is that Brandon didn't actually DO anything.
A friend of Brandon's explained this well:
I served alongside Brandon both in Iraq and
in Afghanistan. He was in my combat engineer platoon in Iraq in 2006 and
in Afghanistan 2011
Brandon was the man who opened my eyes to the slow hemorrhaging of civil
rights in America and the extreme and purposeful devaluation of the
dollar.
Whether you agree with his method or mode of expressing himself is
erroneous. He has broken no laws and hurt no one.
What Brandon did do, was to type certain words
into the Bureau of PreCrime's servers, aka, Facebook.
For this, he was promptly picked up by a swarm
of law enforcers, including the FBI, Secret Service, and county police.
Facebook is the Department of PreCrime, and the rest of the Internet
is following. You had better start taking that seriously.
And please don't expect this situation to be reformed.
Since 9-11, law
enforcement on all levels has been publicly worshipped beyond measure. Aside
from reality shows and sports, television has effectively become Cop Worship
Theater.
Their arrogance and their power will not go away
for a long time.
Face this or don't. It's your life.
