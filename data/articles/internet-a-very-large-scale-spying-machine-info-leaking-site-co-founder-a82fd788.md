RT
Website
Cryptome.org was publishing classified and
secret documents long before WikiLeaks made headlines. Cryptome co-founder
John Young told RT such sites are allowed to stay online so that spy
services might keep an eye on their visitors.
There is no secrecy on the Internet, John Young warned.
In terms of their being able to see
everything that we are doing, we know that we cannot keep any secrets
about our site and we tell our readers, You should not expect us to
protect you, because we are being watched and every other site is being
watched, just like WikiLeaks is being watched, he said.
Theres no secrecy on the Internet - thats
the lesson weve learned and we are now trying to spread that.
They [the security services] use our site to see whats going on and
thats something that weve learned about sites like ours. They are left
in place in order to watch who comes there and see what kind of
information weve put up, John Young added.
The reason we havent been shut down is
that we are useful to them to see what kind of attention is paid to this
material. We think they actually feed us material to put up as they are
feeding information to WikiLeaks and many other sites that operate the
same way.
John Young said Cryptome grew out of his
participation in the group called Cypherpunks - which was also the group in
which Julian Assange learned his skills.
This group was composed of very
highly-educated engineers, scientists and technicians who were mostly
working for corporations and government on the technology of
communication security, he said.
Cryptomes co-founder said secrecy is a biggest
enemy of democracy.
Threats to democracy come from the secret
keepers, and they need to be exposed. It has become a huge industry and
its extremely expensive, he said.
And you cant criticize it, you cant get
access to it, because those who go inside that world are sworn to
life-time secrecy about it and they can never talk about it.
This is a system which is anti-democratic and its a big business now.
Thousands of firms have been drawn into it
since 9/11, because it is
very lucrative. We need to have less secrecy in Congress, less secrecy
in the presidency, less secrecy in all forms of government, he says.
John Young said governments leak more
information for their own purposes than all the secret leaking websites put
together.
They [governments] run operations to leak
secrets to test their own system, he said.
There are schools to train people doing
just that on the Internet. They teach their own people how to run these
sting operations by leaking information to test their system. They are
sometimes called A-teams and B-teams.
