# The Truth Behind The Gates of Auschwitz - David Cole

"It is an undisputed fact of history that,
during World War II, the Germans ran a network of prison and labor
camps, both in Germany and in the territories they controlled.
Into
these camps were sent Jews, prisoners-of-war, resistance fighters,
Gypsies, and other people considered enemies of the Third Reich. The
largest of these camps was the one called Auschwitz, located in Poland.
Those interned at Auschwitz came from all over Europe and consisted of
men, women, and children.
Those able to work were used as labor for
the German war effort. Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet Army in
January of 1945. But that is where the consensus ends.
Since the end of
World War II we have been told repeatedly that many of these camps
served a darker purpose: the genocide of six million Jews and the
execution of five million non-Jews through the use of homicidal gas
chambers in what is now commonly known as the "Holocaust."
The largest number of people are said to
have been murdered at Auschwitz. But there are some people who maintain
these claims of mass murder have never been proven.
These people point
to the lack of documentation other than the highly questionable and
partially discredited evidence supplied by the Soviet Union at the
Nuremberg Trials and the unreliable nature of the eyewitness
testimonies, many of which have also been discredited.
(For example, many former camp
inmates, as well as American soldiers, still speak of "gassing" at the
Dachau camp in Germany, even though it is no longer held that any
[homicidal] gas chamber was ever in use at that camp.)
Still, the Holocaust is an event that has
seemingly grown in importance since the end of the war, taught as
fact... usually accepted without question.
This video deals with, among other things,
one of those proofs, one piece in a very large puzzle: the supposed gas
chamber at the Auschwitz Main Camp."
