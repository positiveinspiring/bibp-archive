VANCOUVER (Silver Gold Bull)
For approximately three years, our governments,
the banking cabal, and the Corporate Media have assured us that they knew
the appropriate approach for fixing the economies that they had previously
crippled with their own mismanagement.
We were told that the key was to stomp on the
Little People with "austerity" in order to continue making full interest
payments to the Bond Parasites - at any/all costs.
Following three years of this continuous, uninterrupted failure, Greece has
already defaulted on 75% of its debts, and its economy is totally destroyed.
The UK, Spain and Italy are all plummeting downward in suicide-spirals,
where the more austerity these sadistic governments inflict upon their own
people the worse their
debt/deficit problems get.
Ireland and Portugal are nearly in the same
position.
Now in what may be the greatest economic "mea culpa" in history, we have the
media admitting that this government/banking/propaganda-machine troika has
been wrong all along.
They have been forced to acknowledge that
Iceland's approach to economic triage was the correct approach right from
the beginning.
What was
Iceland's approach?
To do the exact opposite of everything the
bankers running our own economies told us to do. The bankers (naturally)
told us that we needed to bail out the criminal Big Banks, at taxpayer
expense (they were
Too Big To Fail).
Iceland gave the banksters nothing.
The bankers told us that no amount of suffering (for the Little People) was
too great in order to make sure that the Bond Parasites got paid at 100
cents on the dollar. Iceland told the Bond Parasites they would get what was
left over, after the people had been taken care of (by their own
government).
The bankers told us that our governments could no longer afford the same
education, health care and pension systems which our parents had taken for
granted. Iceland told the bankers that what the country could no longer
afford was to continue to be blood-sucked by the
worst financial criminals
in the history of our species.
Now, after three-plus years of this absolute
dichotomy in economic policymaking, a clear picture has emerged (despite the
best efforts of the propaganda machine to hide the truth).
In typical fashion, the moment that the Corporate Media is forced to admit
that it has been serially misinforming us for the past several years; the
Revisionists are immediately deployed to rewrite history, as shown in this
Bloomberg Businessweek
excerpt:
...the island's approach to its rescue led
to a "surprisingly" strong recovery, the
International Monetary Fund's
mission chief to the country said.
In fact, from the moment
the Crash of
2008 was
orchestrated and our morally bankrupt governments began executing the plans
of the bankers, I have written that the only rational strategy was to put
People before Parasites.
While I wouldn't expect national policymakers to
take their cues from my writing, when I wrote out my economic prescriptions
for our economies I didn't base my views on compassion, or simply "doing the
right thing."
Rather, I have consistently argued that it was a matter of simple arithmetic
and the most-elementary principles of economics that "the Iceland approach"
was the only strategy which could possibly succeed.
When Plutarch wrote 2,000 years ago,
"an imbalance between rich and poor is the
oldest and most fatal ailment of all Republics," he was not parroting
socialist dogma (1,500 years before the birth of Socialism).
Plutarch was simply expressing the First
Principle of economics; something on which all of the modern capitalist
economists who followed in his footsteps have based their own theories.
When modern economists produce their own jargon,
such as the Marginal Propensity to Consume; it is squarely based on the
wisdom of Plutarch:
that an economy will always
be healthier with its wealth
in the hands of the poor and the Middle Class instead of being hoarded by
rich misers (and gamblers).
So when the Bloomberg Revisionists attempt to convince us that Iceland's
strong (and real) economic recovery was a "surprise"; this could only be
true if none of our governments, none of the bankers and none of the media's
precious "experts" understood the most-elementary principles of arithmetic
and economics.
Is this the message the media wants to convey?
What is even more disingenuous here is the congratulatory tone in this
exercise in Revisionism, since nothing could be further from the truth.
As I detailed in a four-part series one year
ago, the campaign of "economic rape" perpetrated against the governments of
Europe over the past two and half years (in particular) has been expressly
designed to take away "the Iceland option" for Europe's other governments.
One of the reasons for Iceland being able to escape the choke-hold of the
Western banking cabal is that its economy (and its people) still retained
enough residual prosperity to tough it out - as the banking cabal tried to
strangle Iceland's economy as retribution for rejecting their Debt Slavery.
Thus, austerity has been nothing less than a deliberate campaign to destroy
these European economies so that the Slaves would be too economically weak
to be able to sever their own choke-holds. Mission accomplished!
One can only assume that neither
the Corporate Media nor
their Banker
Masters would have allowed this clear acknowledgment that Iceland was right
and we were wrong to appear within its own pages, unless it felt secure in
the knowledge that all the remaining Debt Slaves had been crippled beyond
their capacity to ever escape this economic oppression.
Indeed, for evidence of this we need only look to Greece: the one other
European nation where there had been "rumblings" (i.e. riots) aimed at
toppling the Traitor Government that served the banking cabal.
After two elections, the combination of fear and
propaganda bullied the long-suffering Greek people into choosing another
Traitor Government - which had expressly pledged itself to reinforcing the
bonds of economic slavery.
When the Slaves vote for slavery,
the Slave
Masters can afford to gloat.
Here, the purpose of this Bloomberg propaganda was not to praise Iceland's
government (when both the bankers and Corporate Media despise Iceland with
all of their considerable malice). Rather, the goal of this disinformation
was to manufacture a new Big Lie.
Instead of the Truth, that from Day 1 Iceland's approach was the only
possible strategy which could have succeeded, while our own governments
chose a strategy intended to fail; we get the Big Lie.
Our Traitor Governments were acting honestly and
honorably; and Iceland's success and our failure was yet,
"another surprise
which no one could have predicted."
We saw precisely the same Revisionism following the Crash of '08 itself,
where
the mainstream media trotted out all their expert-shills to tell us
they had been "surprised" by this economic event; while those within the
precious metals sector had been predicting precisely such a cataclysm, in
ever more-assertive terms, for several years.
The real message here for readers is that when an economic strategy of
People before Parasites succeeds that there is nothing the least-bit
"surprising" about this.
As with all the remainder of the world around
us, promoting the health of Parasites is only good for the Parasites
themselves.
