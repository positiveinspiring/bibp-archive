The net-neutrality ending deal with Verizon is
just the beginning of Googles plans to kill the open and free Internet
as part of their takeover agenda to completely control the world wide web
and force independent media websites, radio and TV shows out of existence
for good.
Googles agreement with Verizon to speed certain Internet content to users
opens the door to the complete sterilization of the world wide web as a
force for political change.
Under Googles takeover plan, the Internet will
closely resemble cable TV, independent voices will be silenced and the
entire Internet will be bought up by transnational media giants.
People who want to run a simple blog will be priced out of existence, online
TV and radio shows will cease to exist as the Internet is swallowed up by
the corporate borg.
True net neutrality means that independent news
outlets who attract an audience by telling the truth can compete on an even
keel with corporate giants like ABC, CBS and CNN.
The
Google-Verizon pact will end that level playing field and in turn
eliminate everything that is outside of the mainstream.
A non-neutral Internet means that companies
like AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and Google can turn the Net into cable TV
and pick winners and losers online, writes Josh Silver.
A problem just for Internet geeks? You
wish. All video, radio, phone and other services will soon be delivered
through an Internet connection. Ending Net Neutrality would end the
revolutionary potential that any website can act as a television or
radio network.
It would spell the end of our opportunity to
wrest access and distribution of media content away from the handful of
massive media corporations that currently control the television and
radio dial.
The deal will also split the Internet into a
two-tier system, a cyber toll road, where satisfactory speeds and service
will only be obtainable by those willing to pay substantial fees.
The pact also gives Google and huge ISPs the leeway to block certain
websites on wireless networks, meaning Prison Planet and Infowars will go
dark for millions of people.
Once Googles fiercest critics have been silenced for good the company can
then set about
implementing its CIA-backed total information
awareness program, which will scour Twitter accounts, blogs and
websites for all sorts of information left by individual users, aiming to
use this data to predict the future and completely direct and control
peoples lives and behavior.
Google CEO Eric Schmidt
has announced that Google, in conjunction
with the CIA, is set to become the ultimate Big Brother entity that will
know so much about its users that the search engine will be able to help
them plan their lives by constantly tracking their location via smart
phones and telling them where to go and what to do.
We have previously reported on Googles intimate and
long
standing connections to government spy networks.
There is also no doubt that Google is one of the corporations at the
forefront of the governments
drive to use cybersecurity as a pretext for killing the free
Internet, having previously worked with
the NSA
and the CIA.
The recent scandal involving the companys street view roaming vehicles
accessing the wi-fi details of internet users and mapping their
online activities has also raised serious questions over intelligence links
and abuse of privacy laws.
