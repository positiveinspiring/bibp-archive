Admits Coup Plot

Proponents of her ouster
argued that former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff
was targeted and ultimately booted from office for
budgetary wrongdoing or,
ironically, corruption.
But fresh comments by new,
unelected president Michel Temer himself back up
claims that her impeachment was politically
motivated, specifically, that Rousseff wouldn't enact
the austerity-promoting, welfare-slashing economic
platform Temer
unveiled from his party, the
Brazilian Democratic
Movement Party (PMDB), in October when he was vice-president.
The Intercept's
Inacio Vieira
reported on the comments Temer made Wednesday
speaking
to investors in New York City at an event at the
Americas Society and Council of the Americas (AS/COA).
Here is the key comment, as
noted by The Intercept:
And many months ago,
while I was still vice-president, we released a
document named 'A Bridge to the Future' because we
knew it would be impossible for the government to
continue on that course.
We suggested that the
government should adopt the theses presented in that
document called 'A Bridge to the Future.'
But, as that did not
work out, the plan wasn't adopted and a process was
established which culminated with me being installed
as president of the republic.
Watch:
Vieira concludes that the
impeachment,
"was for an agenda of
impunity, profit, and power that would never be
ratified democratically by the Brazilian voting
population at the ballot box, and was thus imposed
on them under the guise of upholding the law."
Public Radio
International also
reported this week:
"A mere two days
after impeaching Rousseff, the same senators
voted to legalize the very budget tricks they
accused her of playing."
In his speech Wednesday,
Fox News Latino
adds,
"Temer made a pointed
appeal to United States investors that his country
is open for business."
In separate reporting by
The Intercept, Glenn Greenwald
writes that,
"what's as revealing as Temer's casual acknowledgement of coup-type motives
is how Brazil's large media - which united in favor of
impeachment - has completely ignored his comments,"
thus "ignor[ing] the huge implications for what this
illuminates about Dilma's removal."
"Just contemplate that,"
Greenwald added, "the installed president of the
country admits to a room full of oligarchs and
imperialists in New York that he and his party
impeached the elected president for ideological
and policy reasons, not because of the stated
reasons, and the entire big Brazilian press pretends
that it never happened."
According to
British-Brazilian writer and athlete Juliano Fiori,
"In removing the elected
president for ostensibly political reasons, the
impeachment of Dilma is a coup against democracy."
Temer was formally installed
as president just hours after the August 31
impeachment of Rousseff, and has since
faced protests.
He will complete the rest of what
would have been her term, serving through the end of
2018.
