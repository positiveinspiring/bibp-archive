The biggest banks in the US have been given advisement by US regulators that
they must
make plans to stave off a complete
financial collapse without relying on the US government.
Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and other
technocrats have secretly crafted worst-case scenarios in which they can
continue to thrive during a full-blown domestic monetary crisis.
The Federal Reserve and the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC)
named,
-
Citigroup Inc.
-
Morgan Stanley
-
JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
...as well as others to devise recovery plans
in 2010.
Banks were directed to have schemes to remain
afloat by selling off assets, finding alternative sources of funding,
reducing risky measures that make a quick buck.
These strategies were to be perfected with,
no assumption of extraordinary support from
the public sector.
Resolution plans, required under the
2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law
describe how to liquidate banking assets without causing further damage to a
failing financial system.
By selling non-core assets without upsetting
shareholders while protecting the monetary system, taxpayers and creditors
is the work of the mega-banks who have contributed solely to the destruction
of the global financial markets.
The OCC constantly monitors the largest banks and evaluates their resolution
plans to provide assurance to the US government that financial instability
will not destroy the banking industry in America.
The details of the resolution plans are considered confidential. While the
mega-banks wait to see if another round of banker bail-outs will alleviate
the pressure of the international interests as Bank of America and
Citigroup begin to act as if they are
implementing their resolution plans covertly.
Bank of America has sold off portions of
their domestic assets to secure capitol while Citigroup has followed suit.
By ridding themselves of non-core assets,
combined with bailout monies, Citigroup, in their resolution plan decided by
management meetings by regulators, will,
make appropriate assumptions as to the
valuations of assets and off-balance sheet positions.
By adhering to initiatives provided by the
Financial Stability Board, these mega-banks
will, when they enact their resolution plans, coordinate with international
banking institutions and regulators rather than simply implode.
While preparing for financial collapse, the technocrats on Wall Street are
also acquiring firearms, ammunition and control over private mercenary
corporations like
DynCorp and "Blackwater
as authorized by the Department of Defense (DoD)
directive 3025.18.
DynCorp is a military-based private mercenary contractor that provides
(among other services) intelligence training and support, international
security, contingency plans and operations. Ninety-six percent of their
funding is based on annual revenues from the US federal government. The
international branch of DynCorp has operated as a police force even
assisting local law enforcement
during Hurricane Katrina.
Named as investors for the amassing of gun and ammunition manufacturers are,
-
Citi Bank
-
Bank of America
-
Barclays
-
Deutsche Bank,
...who are pouring money into
Cerebus and Veritas Equity who have taken
over private corporations involved in the controlling riot situations.
The
Federal Reserve Bank, one of the heads of banking cartels, has
their own police force which operates as a protective security for the Fed
against the American public. As part of the
Federal Reserve Act signed in 1913, the
designation of a Federal Law Enforcement - special police officers that are
exclusively regulated by authority of the Fed, whether in uniform or plain
clothes.
These specialized police officers (who train
with Special Response Teams) can work in tandem with local law enforcement
or US federal agencies. These officers are heavily armed with semi-automatic
pistols, sub machine guns and assault rifles as well as body armor.
Across the nation, reports about the militarization of local police
departments reflect Israeli influence in training exercises, according to a
military analyst.
Michael Chertoff, Israeli citizen and former director of the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
explains that the increased use of military
uniforms, armored vehicles, assault weapons, illegal surveillance all
reflects unconstitutional policies of Israeli Defense Forces have become the
new operational manual.
While preparations for financial collapse and technocratic acquisition of
mercenary military forces are being laid out behind closed doors, even the
mere mention of protest against the banking cartels is becoming a crime.
Recently David C. Gorczynski
was charged with attempted bank robbery and
making terroristic threats - and to add insult to injury, one misdemeanor
charge of disorderly conduct.
Gorczynski is only guilty of protesting outside
a Wells Fargo Bank while holding one sign that read,
Youre Being Robbed and another that
stated Give a man a gun, he can rob a bank. Give a man a bank, and he
can rob a country.
Carl Scalo, Easton police chief said that,
We cant allow the perceived idea of
protesting to be a defense to criminality. People have to understand if
they want to protest, theres a line.
Mary Catherine Roper of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) believes that the charges are,
overzealous... especially given the clear
political nature of the statements.
Last week, Russian-based security firm, Kapersky
Lab, uncovered a
cyber-surveillance virus that specifically
targets banking transactions, stealing login information for social
networks, email and instant messaging. Infected computer are mostly in the
Middle East; however CitiGroup Inc.s Citibank and eBays Paypal online
payment system.
This virus focus on online banking makes it a potential threat to banking
systems worldwide.
Ever since the
global fiat currency implosion that begun in 2008,
the banking cartels have been propping up the American financial system to
stave off a
complete monetary collapse in the US.
However it has always been their intention to
bring down the monetary system in America. Ironically, Gauss may be the mode
in which they are able to carry this out.
In the event that Gauss is used as an excuse to shut down the banking
industry domestically to purge all computers of the virus, this would be the
flashing red warning signal that the covert banking holiday has begun. Since
all mega banks have resolution plans filed with the Fed, their insolvency
would be superficial.
Once all customer funds were electronically transferred into off-shore
accounts, the specialized police forces and hired mercenaries would be
stepped forward to protect the technocrats from retaliation for their
crimes.
Tactical manuals have already been written to explain how to lockdown
urbanized centers in the event of a domestic insurrection.
From law-enforcement battalions consisting of
specialized Marine Corp military police to collaboration of a Police
Stabilization Force, the resolution plans put forth by the mega-banks in
conjunction with
the DHS and
the US Armed Forces preparatory measures, it is
clear that when the monetary system in America finally does collapse, they
will be prepared.
Will you be?
