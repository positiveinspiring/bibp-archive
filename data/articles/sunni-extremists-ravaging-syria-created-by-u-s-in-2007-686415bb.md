A
2007 New Yorker article written by renowned journalist Seymour
Hersh revealed a plan under the Bush Administration to organize, arm,
train, and deploy a regional army of Sunni terrorists, many with ties
directly to Al Qaeda, in a bid to destabilize and overthrow both Syria and
Iran.
The plan consisted of US and Israeli backing,
covertly funneled through Saudi proxies to conceal Washington and Tel Aviv's
role, in building the Sunni extremist front.
According to Seymour Hersh's 2007 article, "The
Redirection - Is the Administration's new policy benefiting our enemies in
the war on terrorism?," (1)
Saudi Arabia, a more credible candidate for openly interfacing with
the militants, openly admitted that it was a danger, but that they "created
it," and therefore could "control it," in meetings with Washington.
The plan called for not only setting up
terrorist enclaves in nations neighboring Syria, including Lebanon, Jordan,
and US-occupied Iraq, but also for building up the Muslim Brotherhood, both
inside Syria's borders and beyond - including in Egypt.
Hersh's work now holds new relevance as revelations that indeed a
Sunni-extremist element is behind the violence in Syria, including a
horrific bombing in Damascus (2) that has killed scores and
injured hundreds.
That these Sunni elements are openly supported
by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, with militants and weapons flowing in
from the above mentioned
Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon, (3) just as
planned in 2007, shows clearly that the US-Israeli-Saudi plan is unfolding
as intended.
As the West feigns shock and horror over the rise of their Sunni front, from
Egypt to Syria, and beyond, along with the resurrection of
the Muslim Brotherhood, who Hersh confirmed
was already benefiting from US and Saudi aid in 2007, it is clear that in
reality this is the fruition of a complex premeditated plan, years in the
making.
The accomplices include Neo-Conservatives,
-
Dick Cheney
-
Elliott Abrams
-
Zalmay Khalilzad,
...who also serves on the board of the US State
Department's National Endowment for Democracy, (4) a chief
facilitator of the
US-engineered "Arab Spring"
(5)
destabilization that brought the Muslim Brotherhood (purposefully) back onto
the Middle East's political landscape.
This after Arab nations fought long difficult
battles against the Brotherhood's brand of violent extremism and
anti-secular policies.
Martin Indyk of the US State Department under
former President Clinton, a former Ambassador to Israel, and a director at
the corporate-financier funded think-tank, the Brookings Institution, was
also mentioned in Hersh's report, and was a co-author of the infamous 2009 "Which
Path to Persia?" report, (6)
openly declaring US machinations in bringing down the Iranian government,
including the use of listed terrorist organizations.
Image: Twin car bombings in Damascus Syria kill scores
and maim hundreds - the final result of years of
US-Israeli-Saudi backing of vicious Sunni terrorists,
admitted in both Seymour Hersh's 2007 article, "The
Redirection," as well as across US policy think-tanks
openly conspiring to fund and arm listed terrorist
organizations for use against Syria, Iran, and even
Pakistan.
Saudi Arabia's Prince Bandar is noted by Hersh
as instrumental in coordinating efforts between the Saudis, Israel, and the
United States, while the political party built up around pro-Saudi Lebanese
tycoon Rafic Hariri set the groundwork in Lebanon for the creation of
staging points for the violent Sunni front.
With Sunni-extremists committing increasingly frequent and violent
atrocities across Syria, the US and the Western media in general, have
attempted to portray it as a natural progression of Syria's internal
conflict - when in reality, based on Hersh's report and confirmed again more
recently as the source of the rebels' funding and support is revealed, it is
clearly the result of this long-planned act of foreign aggression against
Syria, perpetrated by the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and their Sunni proxies
in
the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hersh's report had warned of the tragic consequences to be expected once
this Sunni-front had been unleashed, namely, according to former CIA agent
Robert Baer in Lebanon,
"Sunni Arabs carrying out a cataclysmic
conflict."
Baer warned of the need to protect Christians
from a predictable onslaught by Sunni extremists - an onslaught now playing
out against Syria's 10% Christian population, according to
the LA Times'
"Church fears 'ethnic cleansing' of Christians in Homs, Syria," (7)
and more recently in USA Today's distorted, but
still telling,
"Christians in Syria live in uneasy alliance with Assad, Alawites." (8)
Christians are not the only minorities being targeted by the
US-Israeli-Saudi terrorist front, but all minorities are as is secularism
itself, being systematically attacked, as is the case in the wake of the
NATO-backed dismemberment of Libya. (9)
As the US attempts to portray terrorist violence in Syria as the fault of
Syria's government for not yielding to "international" pressure - we must
remember that while they are absolutely correct - it is not because the
Syrian government has reaped the consequences of inciting its own people to
violence, but is instead suffering at the hands of a Sunni-extremist
front, created by the West and its allies years in advance for the sole
purpose of sowing terror to destabilize, divide, and forever destroy Syria
and Iran.
Should Syria or Iran fall to such machinations,
their fate will be no different than that of Libya, now lying in absolute
ruin, without a government, without law, but with torturers and militants
roaming the streets and preying on the population as Libya's oil is pilfered
by foreign contractors.
There will be no winners if Syria falls, no appeasing the reckless forces of
terror manufactured and thrust at the Syrian people. Only unity and
perseverance will save Syria from suffering Libya's fate.
The Arab World itself must make a reassessment
in the midst of a geopolitical landscape manipulated by the US, Israel, and
Saudi Arabia, pitting Muslim against Muslim for the sake of destroying the
stability needed for all to prosper.
