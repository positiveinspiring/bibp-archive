One of the most popular films of 2012 was The Hunger Games which portrayed a post-apocalyptic nation called Panem in which a super-rich, super-pampered, super-callous 'elite' lived in high-tech luxury while the rest of the population daily battled to survive in abject poverty locked away behind prison fences in intensively-populated 'people zones'.
Panem comes from the Latin phrase panem et circenses or 'bread and circuses' - a term derived from Rome and meaning to give the people diversions and distractions to hide what is being done to them.
Exactly what is happening today... The Totalitarian Tiptoes to just such a world are happening all around us, although most people can't see this because they don't connect the dots. People tend to live in their own 'little world' and focus on only a few subjects and interests. This gives them a distorted view of what is happening because they are so busy concentrating on the strands that they cannot see the tapestry.
The world of The Hunger Games is already well on the way to fruition unless humanity has a fundamental reassessment of reality. The foundations, structure and 'must haves' of a Hunger Games society are detailed in a plan being imposed through the United Nations called Agenda 21 which encompasses two related themes of 'sustainable development' and 'biodiversity'.
Sustainable development - as in don't use more than can be replaced - sounds sensible enough at first until you realize what this and biodiversity really mean in the context of the conspiracy. Agenda 21 was established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janerio, Brazil, in 1992, hosted by Maurice Strong, a Canadian oil and business billionaire and long-time front man for the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
Strong has been a leader of their exploit-the-environment-to-scam-the-people program which is now in full flow.
Strong is a member of the Club of Rome, the environmental Hidden Hand in the Round Table network that includes the,
Bilderberg Group Trilateral Commission Council on Foreign Relations
Bilderberg Group
Trilateral Commission
Council on Foreign Relations
Strong said in support of Agenda 21:
'Isn't the only hope for this planet that the industrialized civilization collapse? Isn't it our responsibility to bring that about?'
This is a man who became mega-rich through the oil industry.
He now lives in billionaire luxury in China where carbon-emitting industry is booming and he is a director of the Chicago Climate Exchange (largest shareholder, Goldman Sachs), which is,
'the world's first and North America's only legally-binding greenhouse-gas emission registry reduction-system for emission sources and offset projects in North America and Brazil'.
The Exchange was established with funding from the Joyce Foundation where Barack Obama was once a director.
Maurice Strong and Al Gore make money through the Carbon Exchange and other means from the lies they promote about climate change and the solutions they propose.
Kate Johnston wrote on the Globalresearch.ca website:
'The same men that sold us the myth of man-made global warming are the same men that sold us the "solution" of a Carbon Tax and Emissions Trading Scheme and now they're profiting off their lucrative investments which are based on lies.' Source - see also The Climate Change Hoax

Strong fled to China in 2006 after being accused of corruption with respect to the UN oil for food program. Climate change propaganda is a No-Problem-Reaction-Solution technique to justify Agenda 21 and its stable-mate the Biodiversity Treaty. This is an internationally-binding document involving nearly 200 countries.
The United States signed the treaty, but it was not ratified by the Senate after people like ecologist and ecosystem scientist Dr. Michael Coffman exposed its true consequences and implications.
He said that he realized during the 1980s and 1990s that the plan was to use the excuse of protecting the environment to confiscate half the land of the United States. Similar plans exist for every other country. America may not have ratified the treaty, but it is being implemented by the day.
Agenda 21 demands the central global control of,
all land all private property all water sources and distribution all other resources which includes people in its definition all energy supplies and distribution all food production and distribution
all land
all private property
all water sources and distribution
all other resources which includes people in its definition
all energy supplies and distribution
all food production and distribution
Agenda 21 is called 'the agenda for the 21st century' and that refers to global fascism/communism.
This is a summary of what Agenda 21/Sustainable Development/Biodiversity is seeking to impose:
An end to national sovereignty State planning and management of all land resources, ecosystems, deserts, forests, mountains, oceans and fresh water; agriculture; rural development; biotechnology; and ensuring 'equity' (equal slavery) The State to 'define the role' of business and financial resources Abolition of private property (it's not 'sustainable') 'Restructuring' the family unit Children raised by the State People told what their job will be Major restrictions on movement Creation of 'human settlement zones' Mass resettlement as people are forced to vacate land where they currently live Dumbing down education (achieved) Mass global depopulation in pursuit of all the above
An end to national sovereignty
State planning and management of all land resources, ecosystems, deserts, forests, mountains, oceans and fresh water; agriculture; rural development; biotechnology; and ensuring 'equity' (equal slavery)
The State to 'define the role' of business and financial resources
Abolition of private property (it's not 'sustainable')
'Restructuring' the family unit
Children raised by the State
People told what their job will be
Major restrictions on movement
Creation of 'human settlement zones'
Mass resettlement as people are forced to vacate land where they currently live
Dumbing down education (achieved)
Mass global depopulation in pursuit of all the above
This horrific plan is being coordinated through the United Nations, the stalking horse for world dictatorship, via a non-governmental network once called the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives - ICLEI), and now known as Local Governments for Sustainability although still using the shortened name ICLEI.
The United Nations is now opening 'embassies' around the world called 'UN Houses' under the guise of raising awareness of UN activities, but not the activities that people really need to know about.
They have opened one in Hunter Square, Edinburgh, Scotland, for example. Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) and other organizations are integrating the plan into every village, town, city and region and it is already becoming widespread across the world.
The organizational infrastructure of Agenda 21 is already fantastic and involves government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), think-tanks, trusts, foundations, 'training' (mind control) operations and 'initiatives' which have been building the infrastructure for what they call 'the post-industrial, post-democratic' society while the public go about their daily business oblivious of the prison being built all around them by the hour. Harvey Ruvin, a vice-chairman of ICLEI, was asked how Agenda 21 would affect liberties with regard to the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, private property and freedom of speech.
He replied:
'Individual Rights must take a back-seat to the collective.'
The arrogance of these people is breathtaking.
The extraordinary network supporting ICLEI and Agenda 21 includes the,

These and so many others are working to the same end - Agenda 21 and total human enslavement worldwide, although most of those involved will have no idea that they are building a global prison for themselves and their families. Another of these front organizations is the World Business Council for Sustainable Development which includes the hideously anti-people Monsanto.
Destroying food-growing land, contaminating the countryside with toxins and replacing proper food with deadly and soil-destroying genetically-modified organisms is Monsanto's contribution to 'sustainability'.
Agenda 21 is operating in more than 600 towns, cities and counties in the United States and expanding by the day. A member of the Agenda 21 committees in Santa Cruz, California, in the mid-1990s said that the proposals he heard were so crazy that he laughed at them because they could never happen.
These included that,
'Mother Earth's surface was not to be scratched' humans should be concentrated in settlement zones education should focus on the environment as a central organizing principle and all aspects of life covered by Agenda 21,
'Mother Earth's surface was not to be scratched'
humans should be concentrated in settlement zones
education should focus on the environment as a central organizing principle and all aspects of life covered by Agenda 21,
...but all of these crazy plans are now being introduced.
It's all happy, feely, smiling faces and how we care, when the truth is that Agenda 21 is a vicious, brutal, heartless strategy to impose a global Orwellian state. Agenda 21 manipulators either create or hijack some local organization or other, many of them in locations with large populations, and they have their (controlled) leadership to agree the Agenda 21 blueprint for their community together with any uninformed, unwitting idiots who can be sold a human nightmare as saving the planet.
This allows them to claim that decisions were made after 'public participation' when that would have been the last thing they wanted, and 99 percent of the 'community' has never heard of Agenda 21 let alone had their say on it.
They want no democracy which is why these people talk privately, sometimes even publicly, about the post-democratic, post-industrial society. They want to control every man, woman and child on the planet - everyone and everywhere and every resource, water source and piece of land. To do this they need a global structure of fascist control that goes right down into every local community with the jackboots at local level enforcing the will of the global centre.
This is why there is so much emphasis on local authorities and town and city authorities in Agenda 21. There is a 'training organization' called Common Purpose (common purpose, common consensus, everyone the same) which has been paid very large amounts of money by governments and local authorities, police forces and other institutions of state to 'train the leaders' of the post-democratic, post-industrial society.
Common Purpose was heavily represented in the Leveson 'inquiry' leading to new media laws in Britain.
It is not a training program; it is a programming program and turns out unquestioning zombie administrators who serve the god of Agenda 21 and the associated European Union.
The theme of 'common' also applies to the ever greater standardization of laws and regulations and constant reference to 'international law'. This is the unfolding global dictatorship of Agenda 21.
What do you need to be a global dictator?
Laws that everyone on the planet must obey - international law and the standardization of global regulation.
Figure 1
The demand in Agenda 21 for a massive cull of the population
can be understood when you see how much of America
is designated for no human activity.
You can see The Hunger Games connection when you look at the official Biodiversity wish-for map of the United States in Figure 1.
The red areas are designated for no human use and most of the rest of America is confiscated for little and highly-regulated use. The mass of the population would be concentrated in high-rise, densely-packed 'human settlement zones' and denied access to something like 80 percent of present day America.
It is without question the world of The Hunger Games with a globally-enforced top-down hierarchy that has a world government using its world army and police force to impose its will at regional and local levels (sectors).
The Rockefeller-funded America 2050 has produced a map of the new United States divided into eleven 'megaregions' and includes parts of Canada (Figure 2).
Seattle, Portland and Vancouver, British Columbia, become the mega-region known as 'Cascadia' and this regional system comes under the collective name of 'megalopolis' which is Greek for large city or great city.
America, Canada and Mexico are due to merge to form the North American Union in line with the European Union blueprint.
Figure 2
The Rockefeller-funded America 2050 map
of America and Canada divided into megaregions.
The European Union is planned to be broken up into regions and the same structure is in development all over the world.
The map of the new Europe has regions from different countries linked up with regions in other countries to end any vestige of national sovereignty or even national existence (Figure 3).
This is a global plan with its fierce central control hidden behind its lower elements such as the European Union and local government.
What is planned would clearly require a fantastic reduction of the global population and this is indeed what Agenda 21/Sustainable Development/Biodiversity demand.

The European Union has the same
regional structure in its sights.
