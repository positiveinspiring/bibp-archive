Captain David Astle,
Colborne, Ontario
September 15th 1993,
Great indeed was my surprise when I opened your small parcel to find therein
a translation into Hungarian of "The Babylonian Woe".
Please accept my
thanks! I esteem your unsolicited work as a great honor, and it is indeed
an event in my life. There may be other translations, but I do not know
where they are. It is not the easiest type of book to translate.
A Greek
lady set down to translate it into Greek but she gave up after a chapter or
two (so far as I know). She told me that it was as difficult as translating
Plato into English!... I am the more pleased that you are one of the
relatively few who truly understand the theme and its significance in the
rise and fall of civilizations.
The impression that Hungarians in Toronto
have given me is that there is no people more aware generally of this fact.
No specially deep thought is required to see that everything we describe as
civilization and indeed all of its works, is the derivative of
Money Power
and its creation as indeed by Sovereign Power or by the activities of an
International criminal caste...
Law No. 7 of Hammurabi that I quote is evidence enough.
Also the proscription by Manu of the Goldsmiths who
used their trade to deceive...
"The most pernicious
of all deceivers is a Goldsmith who commits frauds. The
Maharajah shall order him to be cut to pieces with razors..."
The principal fraud being that which has appeared and
reappeared throughout history, the issuance of fraudulent receipts as
against Gold supposedly on deposit...
This knowledge is written deep into
the memory of your people for there cannot be much doubt that it was the
destroyer of Sumer.
If not, why then
Hammurabi's Law, a repetition of
similar Laws out of much more ancient codes yet again ?
Have you produced a finished book? and if so, have you circulated it? If
you have not done so, then that is obviously the next step. I myself am at
the moment concerned with the United States. "SPOTLIGHT" in Washington plan
a review within a few weeks, which should wake things up thereabouts.
If you do not feel that you want to go further than you have (at the moment)
I might try myself . Though it seems to me that you should be better able to
so do in North America. But there is also Hungary itself, and this is an
understanding they need more than any at this moment when Communism is
supposed to have collapsed and the Jackals will be seeking to take over .
I do not remember whether I replied to your last letter and the copy of
"The
Rise of the Money Power" you sent me. Was it from "The Red Dragon"? and was
that the title of the book found in the library at Cincinnati? I am alone
here and do not mind admitting that I am not as well organized as I would
like to be.
Anyway I had some copies of
"The
Rise of the Money Power" zeroxed and it is doing good work. If I did not reply please accept my
apologies.
The fact is I am 77 years of age and Alas! not getting any younger!
However, as you see, I keep going.
My main effort "The Babylonian Woe" was
not finished until I was practically 60 years of age, and then on top of
that, it had to be sold and promoted generally.
But nevertheless in the last seventeen years it has trickled all around the
world; principally due to my own efforts.
When Mrs. Thatcher said to the
British Parliament that she would not lead Britain into a COMMON MONEY
MARKET, you need have no doubt whose book she had been reading ; she had had
it for 13 years!
If you decide to publish your translation itself, I can advise you to some
extent. However it seems to me there is a wide field open, not only in North
America etc., but in Hungary itself .
I vaguely remember Lillooet as a village near the junction of the Thompson
River and the Fraser river ; not far from Ashcroft and the small town of
Merritt with the Douglas lake ranch in between.
There used to be good
fishing around there. I cannot imagine what it is like now. When I was
there some 45 years ago, the road was just a dirt track crawling around the
edge of the canyon.
If you come here again [why don't you] immediately look me up. At present I
live very much in the country about 83 miles from Toronto - Eastwards.
In
this letter I am giving you my home address the telephone No. is 416
515-8002. Although I keep box 282, Stn. "P" going, most of my mail comes
here these days.
Thank you once again for the honor your work bestows on me and hoping to
hear from you soon
Yours very sincerely
David Astle
PS: "the Red Dragon" is
"Y Draig Coch" in Welsh. As you may know it is
their very ancient flag.
