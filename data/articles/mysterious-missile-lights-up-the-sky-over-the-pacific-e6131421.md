A mysterious missile launch off the southern
California coast was caught on video Monday evening by a KCBS news
helicopter.
The spectacular contrail could easily be seen up in Los Angeles, but who
launched this missile and why, remain a mystery for now.
The magnificent images were captured from the KCBS chopper around 5pm. The
location of the missile was described as west of Los Angeles, north of
Catalina Island, and approximately 35 miles out to sea.
A Navy spokesperson tells News 8, this wasn't its missile. He said there was
no Navy activity reported in that part of the region.
On Friday, November 5, Vandenberg Air Force Base launched a Delta II rocket,
carrying the Thales Alenia Space-Italia COSMO SkyMed satellite, but a
sergeant at the base tells News 8, there have been no launches since then.
News 8 showed the video to Robert Ellsworth, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO
and a former Deputy Secretary of Defense.
He said it didn't appear to be a Tomahawk missile and said it would be
safest to wait for definitive answers to come from the military.
Based on pure speculation, however, Ambassador Ellsworth said, with
President Obama in Asia, perhaps this could have been a show of our military
muscle.
"It could be a test firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile from an
underwater submarine, to demonstrate mainly to Asia, that we can do that,"
he said, stressing that it was just a theory.

A mysterious missile launch off the southern California coast was
caught by CBS affiliate KCBS's cameras Monday night, and officials are
staying tight-lipped over the nature of the projectile.
CBS station KFMB put in calls to the Navy and Air Force Monday night about
the striking launch off the coast of Los Angeles, which was easily visible
from the coast, but the military has said nothing about the launch.
KFMB showed video of the apparent missile to former U.S. Ambassador to NATO
Robert Ellsworth, who is also a former Deputy Secretary of Defense, to get
his thoughts.
"It's spectacular
It takes people's breath away," said Ellsworth, calling
the projectile, "a big missile".
Magnificent images were captured by the KCBS news helicopter in L.A. around
sunset Monday evening. The location of the missile was about 35 miles out to
sea, west of L.A. and north of Catalina Island.
A Navy spokesperson told KFMB it wasn't their missile. He said there was no
Navy activity reported in the area Monday evening.
On Friday night, Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California, launched a Delta
II rocket, carrying an Italian satellite into orbit, but a sergeant at the
base told KFMB there had been no launches since then.
Ellsworth urged American to wait for definitive answers to come from the
military.
When asked, however, what he thought it might be, the former ambassador said
it could possibly have been a missile test timed as a demonstration of
American military might as President Obama tours Asia.
"It could be a test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile from a
submarine
to demonstrate, mainly to Asia, that we can do that," speculated
Ellsworth.
Ellsworth said such tests were carried out in the Atlantic to demonstrate
America's power to the Soviets, when there was a Soviet Union, but he
doesn't believe an ICBM has previously been tested by the U.S. over the
Pacific.
Officially, at least, the projectile remains a mystery missile.
China Fired Missile
...Seen
In Southern California

China flexed its military muscle Monday evening in the skies west of Los
Angeles when a Chinese Navy
Jin class ballistic missile nuclear
submarine, deployed secretly from its underground home base on the south
coast of Hainan island, launched an intercontinental ballistic missile from
international waters off the southern California coast.
WMRs intelligence sources in Asia, including
Japan, say the belief by the military commands in Asia and the intelligence
services is that the Chinese decided to demonstrate to the United States its
capabilities on the eve of the G-20 Summit in Seoul and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit in Tokyo, where President Obama is scheduled to
attend during his ten-day trip to Asia.
The reported Chinese missile test off Los Angeles came as a double blow to
Obama.
The day after the missile firing, Chinas
leading credit rating agency, Dagong Global Credit Rating, downgraded
sovereign debt rating of the United States to A-plus from AA.
The missile demonstration coupled with the
downgrading of the United States financial grade represents a military
and financial show of force by Beijing to Washington.
The Pentagon spin machine, backed by the media reporters who regularly cover
the Defense Department, as well as officials of the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and
the U.S. Northern Command, is now spinning various conspiracy theories,
including describing the missile plume videotaped by KCBS news helicopter
cameraman Gil Leyvas at around 5:00 pm Pacific Standard Time, during
the height of evening rush hour, as the 'condensation trail from a jet
aircraft.'
Other Pentagon-inspired cover stories are that
the missile was actually an amateur rocket or an optical illusion.
Experts agree that this was a
ballistic missile
being fired off of Los
Angeles.
Pentagon insists it was a jet
aircraft or model rocket.
There are no records of a plane in the area
having taken off from Los Angeles International Airport or from other
airports in the region.
The Navy and Air Force have said that they were
not conducting any missile tests from submarines, ships, or Vandenberg Air
Force Base. The Navy has also ruled out an accidental firing from one of its
own submarines.
Missile experts, including those from Janes in London, say the plume was
definitely from a missile, possibly launched from a submarine. WMR has
learned that the missile was likely a JL-2 ICBM, which has a range of 7,000
miles, and was fired in a northwesterly direction over the Pacific and away
from U.S. territory from a Jin class submarine.
The Jin class can carry up to twelve such
missiles.
Navy sources have revealed that the missile may have impacted on Chinese
territory and that the National Security Agency (NSA)
likely possesses intercepts of Chinese telemetry signals during the missile
firing and subsequent testing operations.
Japanese and other Asian
intelligence agencies
believe that a Chinese
Jin-class SSBN submarine
conducted missile show of
force in skies west of Los Angeles.
Asian intelligence sources believe the submarine
transited from its base on Hainan through South Pacific waters, where U.S.
anti-submarine warfare detection capabilities are not as effective as they
are in the northern and mid-Pacific, and then transited north to waters off
of Los Angeles.
The Pentagon, which has spent billions on
ballistic missile defense systems, a pet project of former Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld, is clearly embarrassed over the Chinese show of strength.
Likely route of Jin-class
submarine from Hainan base.
The White House also wants to downplay the
missile story before Presidnet Obama meets with his Chinese
counterpart in Seoul and Tokyo.
According to Japanese intelligence sources,
Beijing has been angry over United States and allied naval exercises in the
South China and Yellow Seas, in what China considers its sphere of
influence, and the missile firing within the view of people in Southern
California was a demonstration that Chinas navy can also play in waters off
the American coast.
For the U.S. Navy, the Chinese show of force is a huge embarrassment,
especially for the Navys Pacific Command in Pearl Harbor, where Japans
December 7, 1941 attack on the fleet at Pearl Harbor remains a sore subject.
In 2002, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice reportedly
scolded visiting Chinese General Xiong Guankai, the deputy chief of
staff for intelligence of the Peoples Liberation Army, for remarks he
allegedly made in 1995 that China would use nuclear weapons on Los
Angeles.
Xiong denied he made any such comments but the
spin on the story helped convince Congress to sink billions of additional
dollars into ballistic missile defense, sometimes referred to at Star Wars
II.
California Missile Launch
Controversial Mystery Missile

Mystery Missile confuses Californians and Americans. In what has become
the latest conspiracy theory the talk of the internet has shifted from the
Chinese UFOs to a certain uncertainty - the mystery launch over California.
The government says that the missile launch contrail that has taken over
the news sites is really from a passenger jet flying from LAX to PHX.
However, some people say that the way that the contrail looks, its a
missile launch.
Photos
of jet contrails taken at various angles, experts, and photos of missile
launches are flooding the net.
What is this mysterious launch?
You can see the below video of the launch.
There are many people who believe the explanation - just as there are many
people who think that this constitutes yet another government cover-up. Some
claim that this is either a missile that no one is telling us was launched
accidentally, a show from a foreign body, or still a mystery even to the
Pentagon.
So what is it? Is it a missile, or is it a plane
or something else?
Below
see a video of an expert weighing in on the California
missile launch, or the mystery missile.

You saw the news of the missile launch north of Catalina in California.
Before they put a total lock down on audio/video I picked up a LOT! I
managed to record some of it.
-
I have brief video recorded of a close-up telephoto of the missile. It is
a MISSILE. NOT an aircraft! Not jet engine "contrails" as the military is
now saying.
-
I listened to people interviewed who were on boats out in that area. No
one was hurt but they all said this "object" suddenly arose from the ocean
at a blinding speed.
-
They ALL said it went straight up. Not sideways like the military now
says. Note the military did not ID the "jet" that caused such an odd
"contrail". Today, no news, no interviews, no anything other than articles
saying "it was just a harmless contrail".
-
YouTube or
Google the video Nike ABM launch to see video of a real
missile and observe the exhaust then compare it to the exhaust of what was
shot yesterday. It is NOT a
wispy multiengine white cloud contrail drifting in the wind.
The missile
yesterday left a compacted pencil thin dark exhaust JUST LIKE THE ABM
MISSILE IN THE YOUTUBE/GOOGLE video. I know what missile exhaust looks like
and what contrails look like.
This left 50,000 feet ++ of compacted dark
exhaust. THAT IS ROCKET FUEL EXHAUST!
Early on you could see the shape of
the object. Long and thin like a cigar. How many airplanes look like that?
In one telephoto shot I saw but my recording wasn't running then I THOUGHT I
could make out markings on the side of the object (I'd say it was several
hundred feet long). NOT English letters. Cyrillic, Greek, Chinese, Japanese - something other than English.
-
The object eventually went out of sight. A lady was interviewed who said
she saw a brief blinding flash followed by a "plume" of "smoke" above where
the object was last seen. She said it was about 15 seconds after losing
sight of the object. Look up the speed of an ICBM.
Calculate visual range of
an object 200 feet long at that speed then add 15 seconds.
That puts it at
about 140,000 feet above the earth. That is technically outer space and no
gasses, radiation, etc. would fall to earth in measurable amounts from that
high up. Nothing to go look for or even measure.
-
Bulletins began to pop up totally independent of this event that nuclear
explosion monitoring stations around the world had just picked up an "event"
somewhere in the world. Not one report connected the two events. Ooops!
Somebody suddenly connected the two. This was on Google News for all of
about six minutes - then gone. No trace anywhere. There were at least a
dozen reports from monitoring stations then the news was GONE!!
-
95% of all you just read is now gone from the Internet. If I post it to YouTube and it is all true, I'll probably never be seen again. If this is
just a series of events of panicked people I create a small, unwarranted
panic and IT IS MY FAULT!
I finally decided to make a few other people aware
of this then stop. This is that message.
What do I think it was?
My best guess is a Chinese ICBM shot straight up
(their subs are seen all the time off our West Coast) armed with the
smallest nuke they have just to "make a point".
THIS was their "warning
shot" about what we are doing with QE2 and all of the other beyond idiotic
economic measures being taken to try to "save" the
dollar from total
collapse after all that
Obama et al have done (and some by
Bush and Clinton
too but 95% Obama).
We MUST back down. One side must blink. It should be us.
We have no rational
reason that we are right in what we are doing.
We are about to destroy the
world's economy. It will destroy many countries and just damage others.
Probably just damage China but they have much to damage since they
essentially own the USA with all of the US debt they have been forced to
buy.
That debt has lost over 20% in value this year; 6% last week!
Would you
put up with that and stand by while the other ten trillion (it's 10 - not
two) you hold of US debt becomes totally worthless?
