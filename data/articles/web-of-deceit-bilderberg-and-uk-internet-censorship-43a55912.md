This fortnight, host Jenny Haase
interviews investigative journalist Matthew Butler on the Total View show
about his article
Web of Deceit - The Bilderberg Group and Elite Powerbrokers Linked to the
UKs Stealth Internet Censorship Coup.
It reveals the critical details, connections,
and players involved in the agenda against freedom of thought and
communication on the internet, which has disturbing consequences already
manifesting against websites of alternative spiritual information and
beliefs.
If you thought it could never happen in the
"free world", the infrastructure has already been put in place in the UK
with other western countries to follow suit.
A must watch for those interested in
spirituality of all kinds and the freedom to access it via the net.
