# Open Letter to Warren Buffett - Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is

Dear Warren,
If you are truly sick and tired of the mega-rich being coddled by a
billionaire-friendly Congress, as you said in your recent NY Times
editorial, why dont you back up your words with some real action and
put your money where your mouth is?
As you well know, though you may not admit it publicly, there is a
system of political bribery in place that allows the mega-rich to
control our political process, thus creating the billionaire-friendly
Congress you claim to be against. Through campaign finance, lobbying
and the revolving door the mega-rich are able to dominate and corrupt
government policy.
If you are serious about what you say, it seems obvious that you would
financially support politicians and organizations that seek to change
these government rigging processes. Saying that you want to be taxed
more by a paid off government, without changing the system that allows
this corruption in the first place, sounds like meaningless rhetoric to
me.
While you are at it, if you truly believe in free market competition,
you must surely want to break up the too big to fail banks that have
now rigged your beloved free market.
Clearly, you cant have free market
competition when a few global financial institutions have consolidated
so much wealth and power that they can crash the economy and then get
paid off politicians and the Federal Reserve to throw trillions of
dollars at a select few and rig the laws and regulations in their
favor. Thats clearly not a free market based on fair competition.
Once again, this a symptom of the system of
political bribery.
So Warren, what do you think? Are you going to support efforts to make
these urgently needed changes, or are you just making meaningless
statements to ease your guilty conscience?
If you are truly concerned about the future of America, you should be
fighting on these fronts.
I sincerely hope you are a man of your word.
If you would like to discuss these issues further or publicly debate
them, please have your people get in touch with me.
Thank you for your time,
David DeGraw
