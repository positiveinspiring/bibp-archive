The Lucis Trust is the Publishing House which
prints and disseminates United Nations material. It is a devastating
indictment of the New Age and Pagan nature of the UN.
Lucis Trust was established in 1922 as Lucifer
Trust by Alice Bailey as the publishing company to disseminate the books of
Bailey and Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society.
The title page of Alice Bailey's book,
'Initiation, Human and Solar' was originally printed in 1922, and clearly
shows the publishing house as,
'Lucifer Publishing CoIn 1923. Bailey
changed the name to Lucis Trust, because Lucifer Trust revealed the true
nature of the New Age Movement too clearly."
(Constance Cumbey, The Hidden Dangers of
the Rainbow, p. 49).
A quick trip to any New Age bookstore will
reveal that many of the hard-core New Age books are published by Lucis
Trust.
At one time, the Lucis Trust office in New York was located at 866 United
Nations Plaza and is a member of the Economic and Social Council of the
United Nations under a slick program called "World Goodwill".
In an Alice
Bailey book called "Education for a New Age"; she suggests that in the new
age,
"World Citizenship should be the goal of the enlightened, with a world
federation and a world brain."
In other words - a One World Government New
World Order.
Luci's Trust is sponsored by among others Robert McNamara, former minister
of Defense in the USA, president of the World Bank, member of the
Rockefeller Foundation, and Thomas Watson (IBM, former ambassador in
Moscow).
Luci's Trust sponsors among others the following organizations:
-
UN
-
Greenpeace Int.
-
Greenpeace USA
-
Amnesty Int.
-
UNICEF
The United Nations has long been one of the foremost world harbingers for
the "New Spirituality" and the gathering "New World Order" based on ancient
occult and freemasonic principles.
Seven years after the birth of the UN, a book
was published by the theosophist and founder of the Lucis Trust, Alice
Bailey, claiming that:
"Evidence of the growth of the human
intellect along the needed receptive lines [for the preparation of the
New Age] can be seen in the "planning" of various nations and in the
efforts of the United Nations to formulate a world plan... From the very
start of this unfoldment, three occult factors have governed the
development of all these plans".
[Alice B. Bailey, Discipleship in the New
Age (Lucis Press, 1955), Vol. II, p.35.]
Although she did not spell out clearly the
identity of these 'three occult factors', she did reveal to her students
that:
"Within
the United Nations is the germ and
seed of a great international and meditating, reflective group - a group
of thinking and informed men and women in whose hands lies the destiny
of humanity. This is largely under the control of many fourth ray
disciples, if you could but realize it, and their point of meditative
focus is the intuitional or Buddhic plane - the plane upon which all
hierarchical activity is today to be found'.
[Ibid. p.220.]
To this end, the Lucis Trust, under the
leadership of Foster and Alice Bailey, started a group called 'World
Goodwill' - an official non-governmental organization within the United
Nations.
The stated aim of this group is,
"to cooperate in the world of preparation
for the reappearance of the Christ"
[One Earth, the magazine of the Findhorn
Foundation, October/November 1986, Vol. 6, Issue 6, p.24.]
But the esoteric work inside the UN does not
stop with such recognized occult groupings. Much of the impetus for this
process was initiated through the officership of two Secretary-Generals of
the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld (held office: 1953-1961) and U Thant (held office:
1961-1971) who succeeded him, and one Assistant Secretary-general, Dr.
Robert Muller.
In a book written to celebrate the philosophy of
Teilhard de Chardin (and edited by Robert Muller), it is revealed:
"Dag Hammarskjöld, the rational Nordic
economist, had ended up as a mystic. He too held at the end of his life
that spirituality was the ultimate key to our earthly fate in time and
space".
[Robert Muller (ed.), The Desire to be
Human: A Global Reconnaissance of Human Perspectives in an Age of
Transformation (Miranana, 1983), p.304.]
Sri Chinmoy, the New Age guru, meditation leader
at the UN, wrote:
"the United Nations
is the chosen instrument of God; to be
a chosen instrument means to be a divine messenger carrying the banner of
God's inner vision and outer manifestation."
William Jasper, author of "A New World Religion" describes the religion of
the UN:
"...a weird and diabolical convergence of
New Age mysticism, pantheism, aboriginal animism atheism, communism,
socialism, Luciferian occultism, apostate Christianity, Islam, Taoism,
Buddhism, and Hinduism".
