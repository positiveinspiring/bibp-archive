A study published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), called Point process modeling of
the Afghan War Diary, says that data supplied
by
WikiLeaks can accurately predict where terrorist (or insurgent)
attacks will happen.
The researchers at Edinburgh University analyzed data uploaded onto
WikiLeaks over 2 years ago where 77,000 military documents dated between
2004-2009 where more telling than originally assumed.
They used mathematical algorithms from statistical data, signal processes
and ecology, as well as utilizing specific software that is designed to
identify trends in massive amounts of information.
According to the software, in Baghlan, Afghanistan violence would rise from
100 in 2009 to 228 in 2010. The actual count was 222, which is strikingly
close to the prediction.
These computer models appear to validate with statistical perspective that
the Middle Easter region is froth with violent outbursts.
DARPAs
Integrated Crisis Early Warning System, which is hailed as a
predictive allocated tool, actually does not live up to its claimed
potential. Large, geopolitical events are not able to be foreseen by
predictive software. The idea that data alone can tell future events is
naïve and takes no account for global Elites consistent manipulation of
violent outbursts and controlled moments of peace.
Recently, WikiLeaks released emails they obtained that were damaging to
Assad called
the Syrian Files.
They showed a relationship between,
western corporations and the Syrian
government.
WikiLeaks spokesperson Sarah Harrison
claimed she could not divulge where they got their information, however it
was mentioned later on that Anonymous (who is a CIA covert operation)
supplied those emails to WikiLeaks.
Of course, Harrison did not mention Julian Assanges
links to the CIA
or his having been raised in the brain-washing cult known as the Family in
Australia that usurps children at a young age and creates controlled
Manchurian candidates that are strategically placed in positions to be
influential in purveying disinformation.
As a psy-op, the manifestation of Assange and WikiLeaks has effectively used
engineered operations of secret document exposure to give the appearance of
forced political responsibility for intelligence and policy failures. This
is detailed in the CIA document entitled,
The Secret Team.
WikiLeaks has been integral in the destruction of sovereign nations such as
the Tunisian government. Assange also leaked information that worked to
further Zionist agendas, as
with the placing of Muhammad Morsi into the
presidency of the Egyptian government after a fake revolution funded by
globalists like George Soros and controlled by the CIA with infiltrated
operatives.
As with Syria, we are again witnessing the assistance of Assange in the
disinformation campaign and psy-op campaign that supports the movements of
Obama, Netanyahu and the UN toward attacking Syria in a prelude toward WW
III.
The use of predictive tools against military reality is demeans the
actuality of assaults on sovereign nations by intelligence operations and is
quite obviously manipulated as a Hegelian Dialectic we can watch happen, if
we are paying attention.
Michael Parenti, in his 2011 lecture , explains these psy-ops as:
This global empire needs to be looked at a
little more closely [as] a military dominion... The US power extends to
more than just bases, there is a global network of military and security
forces.
There are officer classes in many countries
that are trained and advised and equipped by the US and on the US
payroll. And they develop an international camaraderie and they work
with each other...
Military security forces, paramilitary
police and even death squads... All financed, equipped, trained and
advised by the CIA or the US Pentagon and related agencies.
