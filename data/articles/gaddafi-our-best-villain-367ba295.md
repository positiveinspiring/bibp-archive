Muammar Muhammad al-Gaddafi (born 7 June 1942) is a Libyan politician and
revolutionary, who has led the Libyan state since he overthrew King Idris in
a 1969 bloodless coup and established the Libyan Arab Republic.
He went on to survive revolts, military strikes and embargoes while showing
a knack for playing to Western interests, namely geopolitical security and
oil reserves.
Its no surprise many of the interviews about hidden dealings are tainted by
realpolitik. These personal accounts from key players are a fascinating
foray into the diplomatic world of riddles, theatrics and hidden agendas.
In early February 2011, major political protests, which were inspired by
recent protests in Tunisia, Egypt and other parts of the Arab world, broke
out in Libya against Gaddafis government and quickly turned into a civil
war. Gaddafi vowed to die a martyr if necessary in his fight against rebels
and external forces, saying that those rebelling against his government
deserve to die.
On 17 May 2011 the
International Criminal Court issued a request for an
arrest warrant against Gaddafi for crimes against humanity.
This insightful essay-style documentary by Frenchman Antoine Vitkine puts
current events into perspective by examining the motivations behind the
actions of Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, a man whose peculiar
appearance belies savvy negotiation skills.
