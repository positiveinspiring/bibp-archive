The defeat for Obama will represent a deadly
blow to the dynamic of the British Empire, and open up the potential to
accelerate the mass strike ferment in the United States, which is
increasingly reflecting itself in actions in the direction of restoring
national sovereignty.
What we are actually looking at is the conflict of two dynamic processes:
-
the evil dynamic of the British Empire,
which has been dominating the planet for decades
-
the dynamic of the mass strike, which is
reflected both in the fight for national sovereignty against
globalization in Copenhagen, and the fight against fascist measures
such as the Hitler health bill here in the U.S.
The British know that "their way of life" is at
stake, and they are fighting tooth and nail on both fronts. But, right now,
it looks like their efforts may crumble.
There is no agreement on any major issue - from finance, to emissions
targets, to enforcement - at Copenhagen. The British are basically running
the show, and have put their authority on the line.
First there was
Prince Philip at Windsor Castle in
November, then
the Queen at the Commonwealth meeting, then
Charles, and now Gordon Brown trying to run the negotiations.
Their major stumbling block is the stated, and very real, determination by
the Chinese and the Indians to preserve their national sovereignty against
enforcement.
This is the crucial element, and if they have
the guts to stick to it, the British can't get their genocidal plans
through.
If the British are defeated in Copenhagen, by a combination of leading
members of LaRouche's Four Power alliance, it will have devastating
consequences for their British puppet in Washington, who is already
suffering paroxysms of rage and fear.
The hysteria of the Empire on
global warming (in the midst of a very
cold, snowy Copenhagen) is nearly matched by that of the Obama
administration on the health care bill in the United States. One can
only imagine the threats that have to have been issued against Obama, to get
him to go on TV to insanely proclaim that the Federal government "will go
bankrupt" if his cuts to Medicare and Medicaid don't go through.
Those threats, of course, are being further
passed down the line, to try to line up the 60 votes in the Senate to get
this monstrosity through. One source even said that Sen. Ben Nelson
of Nebraska is being told that the
Offutt airforce base in his state will be
shut down, if he doesn't vote for Hitler health.
Within the United States, however, the mass strike dynamic is becoming more
and more visible.
Not only is the population making its voice
heard against the mass murderous health care, but institutional moves are
increasing against two major elements of the suppression of national
sovereignty:
When Time magazine decided to put its backing
behind Fed Chairman 'Bail-out Ben' Bernanke, by naming him its
man of the year, it just stoked the flames of opposition.
Bernanke comes up for a vote in the Senate
Banking committee today, but there are now at least five senators vowing to
put a hold on the nomination once it reaches the floor, and the declared
'no' votes are increasing. Even more striking is the fact that there is now
a bipartisan bill for reinstating Glass-Steagall introduced in the
Senate, along with the one being put in by Democrats in the House.
The restoration of Glass-Steagall is not what is required, LaRouche said
yesterday, but it's a step in the right direction.
The solution would be instituting a credit
system, instead of a monetary system, but those pushing Glass-Steagall
are only going as far as Paul Volcker, who has been campaigning
internationally for the Glass-Steagall standard, will go.
Essentially, they are scared shitless
about the breakdown crisis, and are trying to soften the blow, with measures
that are compromises with what LaRouche has outlined must be done.
