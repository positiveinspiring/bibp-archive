TRUE DEMOCRACY SUMMER 2001 TABLE OF CONTENTS
EDITORIAL
This edition of True Democracy (La verdad sobre la
democracia) is devoted to everyone who ever suffered from the hegemony
of the United States government. In other words, this edition of my unique
magazine is devoted to nearly everyone.
To disband the CIA wouldn't do much good (see the first
edition) because the Defense Intelligence Agency would be given the same
responsibilities that the CIA had so it was with gratitude that I obtained
the documentation which you will read within these pages because the Defense
Intelligence Agency is part of the "Shadow Government" or the government
you've most likely never been aware existed.
The Shadow Government is composed of five branches of government,
not three as the framers fashioned. The documentation is in a Web site which
is http://abovetopsecret.com/pages/secgov.html and will be embellished in
this edition. If you have read the first edition of my unique empowering
magazine you would have read about four of the agencies or organizations
because of my immense good fortune had made me aware that either President
Kennedy wanted to disband them which resulted in his assassination or I had
learned of them because of my being in the right place at the right time
so many times that I learned of them. Specifically, I speak of the Trilateral
Commission and the Bilderbergs, two elite organizations which need to be
exposed to decent people of the world like you.
So, enjoy this edition of True Democracy because it
is devoted to you. If your family hasn't suffered physically or emotionally
because of my government, your taxes have funded the atrocities making you
suffer indirectly.
In
peace and solidarity,
