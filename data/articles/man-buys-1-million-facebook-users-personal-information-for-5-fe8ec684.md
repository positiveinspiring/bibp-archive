How much is your personal information worth?
How about a data set consisting of over 1
million individuals personal information complete with their
full legal name, personal E-mail address, and URL to their Facebook account
as confirmation?
According to one mystery company that recently
sold 1 million
Facebook users personal information to a very surprised
blogger, not very much at all. About $5, to be specific.
It all started when one blogger, a
self-proclaimed seeker of cheap deals that pertain to potentially useful
or interesting subjects, stumbled across an offer for 1 million Facebook
accounts for $5. Skeptical but willing to try it out, the blogger purchased
the list to be met with much surprise when he actually personally identified
many of the users on the list to be people
he actually knew personally.
Complete with their personal E-mail
address (which Facebook is supposed to keep hidden), full names, and a
link to their page to verify, this blogger had stumbled across a major
corporations dream come true.
According to the description from the seller of
the list, the information was collected through Facebook applications and
even checked monthly to ensure validity.
The description stated:
The information in this list has been
collected through our Facebook apps and consists only of active Facebook
users, mostly from the US, Canada, UK and Europe
The list is checked
and validated once a month so you wont get a list full of invalid or
duplicate email addresses
this list has a great potential for you.
After purchasing the list and being amazed at
its legitimacy, the IT blogger
detailing the event along with screenshots and a
surprising follow-up.
Using his personal E-mail provided when signing up for
his Facebook account, Facebooks policy team member
sent him an E-mail asking him
to set up a call with the company.
During the call, things got very
concerning.
Facebook Rep
- Send Us the File, Delete it, and Tell No One
Starting off with a warning to the blogger that
the phone call was being
recorded, the unnamed Facebook rep told the
blogger to send them the file of the 1 million users information, delete
it, and delete all traces of its mentioning off of his blog.
Not agreeing to censor the information, the
blogger posted the quote from the phone conversation on his website:
Now we would like you to send us this file,
delete it, tell us if you have given a copy of it to someone, give us
the website from which you bought it including all transactions with it
and the payment system and remove a couple of things from your blog.
Oh
and by the way, you are not allowed to disclose any part of this
conversation; it is a secret that we
are even having this conversation.
Proceeding to ask whether or not the rep would
fill him in on what would be done by the company, the rep said that it was
an internal issue and that he would not be allowed to know the result.
How Safe is Your Personal
Information?
It has been known for years that Facebooks very
own terms of service allows for blatant privacy intrusions, and the company
has been even caught syncing up with major third party corporations to track
you online and offline.
What has not been seen, however, is an event of
this caliber taking place involving the average consumer. No longer are the
days where major corporations were forced to buy your personal information
and habits through terms of service changes and large volumes of cash.
Now, almost anyone can go online and buy 1
million E-mails, names, and Facebook URLs for a total of $5. In other words,
you could purchase tens of millions of E-mails to spam or otherwise for a
very inexpensive amount.
Whats more is that criminals could also purchase
this database for further malicious reasons.
Its no wonder that Facebook
refuses to discuss the matter in any capacity, demanding that the blogger
remove all content on the subject and pretend that it never happened.
If you absolutely cannot delete your Facebook,
you can at least stop using apps on the platform that are known to be
siphoning your personal information.
Also be sure to use a Facebook specific dummy
E-mail when signing up and choose a nickname or alternative name that is not
the same as your full legal name.
Bulgarian Privacy Activist Buys a...
Million Facebook IDs
...for
A Sandwich, Essentially

Five bucks can get you many things. A fast food
meal. A couple of candy bars. A beer if its not a tiny microbrew or Belgian
or something.
Roughly 100 words written by yours truly (just
dont expect the Gettysburg address or anything). Oh, and also
1.1 million Facebook user IDs, emails, and names.
Heres what happened, and why its annoying or
scary, depending on your perspective.
Bogomil Shopov, a digital rights
activist and blogger, decided to see how easy it was to get Facebook contact
information.
It turns out it was as simple as finding some
random guy on an Internet message board, who had this description posted:
The information in this list has been
collected through our Facebook apps and consists only of active Facebook
users, mostly from the US, Canada, UK and Europe.
There are users from other countries as well
but they are almost exclusively English speaking as well, as all the
apps we provide are written in English and to use them properly one
needs to read the instructions.
The list is checked and validated once a
month so you wont get a list full of invalid or duplicate email
addresses.
Facebook is currently calling this a breach, a
breach theyre taking so seriously they called Shopov, demanded that he send
them the data and delete it, and then
take down his post about how sloppy they are with user data.
Apparently the conversation he had was magical
and super-secret, and someday somebody is going to have to explain to legal
interns that saying This communication is confidential doesnt make it so.
Its not really clear what Facebook can do,
though. Apps are allowed to collect this information, and presumably users
have agreed to share their data.
But its nice to see them pretending to care.
The Price of...
A Million Facebook Names and Email Addresses?
-
A Measly $5... -

The majority of us are painfully aware that
companies are persistently
mining our personal data in their relentless quest to make a profit from
it. You would think that something like your Facebook presence (& email
address) would be particularly valuable, but what value you would you put on
it?
Im not a number crunching type, maths was never
my strong point but Id guess a buck or two, maybe less, maybe $0.50 -
surely it cant be less than that though, can it?
Well according to Czech IT Consultant Bogo
Shopov it is considerably less than that! He claims to have
paid
just $5 for a spreadsheet containing ONE MILLION links to valid Facebook
accounts which included the users real names and their email addresses!
That works out at just $0.000005 each if you are
willing to buy in bulk, which all of the companies who go digging for your
data like to do!
In his
blog,
Shopov said that he came across the unbelievable find whilst scouring the
internet for bargains, he said: I have the bloody
habit to look for cheap deals on some websites.
This particular find turned up on Gigbucks.com -
a site where individuals offer various different data mining services and
according to the
Daily Dot, the offer of 1million users info for $5 is
still on there!!
The description of the offer says:
The information in this list has been
collected through our Facebook apps and consists only of active Facebook
users, mostly from the US, Canada, UK and Europe.
There are users from other countries as well
but they are almost exclusively English speaking as well, as all the
apps we provide are written in English and to use them properly one
needs to read the instructions.
The list is checked and validated once a
month so you wont get a list full of invalid or duplicate email
addresses. Whether you are offering a Facebook, Twitter, social media
related or otherwise a general product or service, this list has a great
potential for you.
Finally, the list is in a zipped excel
format split into 12 sheets, each sheet containing roughly 100,000 email
addresses with name, last name and Facebook profile information
separated with comma.
Shopov stated:
I make a quick check over the data and
surprise, surprise: most of them are real and I even know some of those
users.
Shopov then took a screenshot of a page from the
document and the
Daily Dot verified that at least some of the accounts listed there were
valid (according to SEC Filing - Facebook has 83 million fake accounts).
Then things get really interesting, Shopov
claims to have been
emailed by Facebooks Platform Policy Team requesting his phone number.
They
contacted the IT Consultant and demanded details of his purchase. Then
they told him to delete his blog post about the incident and not tell anyone
about the conversation.
How very cloak-and-dagger!

Warning: According to Facebook you are not
allowed to read this post, so beware.
The
Daily Dot has stated that Facebook has not yet responded to their
request for an official comment on this sensational story!
