Some weeks ago, I wrote an article dealing with
a bizarre lawsuit full of
twists and turns that has been filed against individuals, governments,
private institutions, and secret societies spanning the entire globe.
Essentially, the plaintiff of the lawsuit is
alleging that billions of dollars worth of U.S. bonds were stolen from him
by a wide-ranging cartel - bonds that he was entrusted with by the extremely
rich and reclusive Dragon family of Asia.
But what at first may seem like an isolated incident, now appears to be an
emerging pattern of theft of U.S. bonds from individuals who have either
acquired them individually or have had them passed down through generations.
That is, at least the claims of stolen bonds are becoming more and more
common.
Take, for instance,
another recent lawsuit filed with the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania - U.S. Federal Court, by Joseph Riad.
Riad is suing the U.S. Federal Government for $15 billion as a result of the
fifteen $1 billion bonds that he alleges have yet to be returned to his
possession by an agent of the Department of Homeland Security.
Riad claims
to have a total of 735 $1 billion Federal Reserve bonds that are stashed in
banks outside of Philadelphia where he lives. These 735 are in addition to
the 15 bonds he is suing for.
The 15 bonds at issue, according to Riad, came from three rare sealed and
certified bronze boxes, each of which contained 245 $1 billion Federal
Reserve bonds dated back to 1934.
As Reuben Kramer of Courthouse News Service
writes,
The billion-dollar bonds allegedly were
used by the government for debt-management purposes in the 1930s when
physically moving lower-denomination currency or gold was impractical.
Riad allegedly discovered the bonds after his
attorney suggested he open the boxes to determine whether or not there was
anything of value inside them.
But, while some may automatically assume that Riads claim is false or that
his bonds are fake, all indications are that the bonds are, in fact, real.
Indeed, Riad has cited in his lawsuit,
extensive and exhaustive proof of the
authenticity of the Bonds.
However, according to Riad, no federal agency
will redeem them, despite this proof.
As part of his case, Riad has provided what he calls and
Affidavit of
Procurement, in which he states that the boxes became collateral for over
$76,000 in loans made by him to,
a mandate to the South African government.
Riad claims that he has spent nine years confirming the authenticity of the
bonds, including contacting a number of officials and experts in the field
of bonds, finance, and sculpting and metal.
Riad claims that he contacted,
Kermit Harmon, PE, CEM, CCP, DGCP, a former
Security Director for the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, and an expert in
bonds, notes, and other financial instruments,
...and that Harmon, along with
Bruce Colburn, PhD., PE, CEM, inspected these bonds meticulously and
determined that they are authentic government-issued Federal Reserve bonds.
Riad has attached the report made by Harmon and Colburn to his lawsuit as an
exhibit.
Riad also claims that he consulted,
A.J. Obara, internationally-renowned
bronze sculptor and bronze metal expert, who inspected Plaintiffs three
bronze boxes containing the bonds.
It is then claimed that Obara also
confirmed the authenticity of the bonds. Like Harmons report, the report by
Obara is also included as an exhibit to the lawsuit.
Furthermore, the lawsuit claims that Riad contacted Dr. Franklin Noll,
a
consultant with the Bureau of Public Debt who is an historian with expertise
in the history of government-issued, high-denomination bonds, such as those
Plaintiff possesses,
...as well as former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury,
Stuart Eizenstat, Esq., and Patrick Oxford, Esq. of Houston, all of whom
recognized the bonds as real and authentic.
Riad asserts that he was then referred to the Secret Service, where he met
with Secret Service agents Chad Sweet and Craig Caldwell who took the bonds,
confirmed their authenticity, and then returned them.
Again, Riad includes
the report that the agents produced in reference to their documentation of
the receipt of those bonds, as an exhibit in the suit. It should be noted
that the filing points out that if the bonds had been fraudulent or fake,
the Secret Service would have been bound by law to seize them and that they
would not have been returned.
This is where Riad claims his fortunes took a turn for the worse. He claims
he was referred to the Bureau of Public Debt, and specifically to an
official of that department by the name of Donna Ayers.
However, according
to Riad, Ayers completely denied the existence of such bonds and referred
him back to the Secret Service agents, who, in turn,
inspected plaintiffs
bonds, reviewed the accompanying expert reports, and performed their own
evaluations and tests so as to render their own opinion as to the
authenticity of plaintiffs bonds.
Riad claims that the agents then contacted Ayers and,
informed her that
plaintiff had completed the appropriate and required examination and
authentication of the Bonds and that the redemption of said bonds did fall
under the purview of the BPD, since the bonds were outstanding government
issued securities/debts.
However, Riad states, he still received no
cooperation from the BPD and was forced to take other avenues.
These other avenues led Riad to the Department of Homeland Security and an
agent, Nickolaus Jones, who Riad claims was determined to fraudulently
acquire the bonds.
Riad claims he learned about Jones through a man named
Neil Gibson, an individual that was,
an alleged British financial consultant who claimed to have experience in
the repatriation of high-denomination U.S. government bonds, and who
represented to plaintiff that he had a contract with the U.S. government to
complete such transactions and that he had successfully handled such
projects on behalf of the U.S. government in the past.
The lawsuit further states that Agent Jones confirmed his ability to
repatriate U.S. government bonds and that he had a working relationship with
Neil Gibson in this specific regard. Jones then confirmed the bonds held by Riad as bonds he already knew existed and told Riad that he wanted to know
more about them.
This, Riad claims, was all part of the ultimate deception.
Nevertheless, Riad says he met with Agent Jones at Jones Irvine, California
government office for approximately three hours in March 2009. According to
the suit, Jones once again confirmed for a second time that he was an agent
with DHS, and produced his identification badge and business card to prove
it.
However, Riad says there was another man present at the meeting who refused
to do any of those things, even after being asked repeatedly by Riad and his
then-lawyer for identification. Interestingly enough, Jones made no attempt
to help identify the man either, even though he was witness to a discussion
involving such a large amount of money.
Continuing the story, the filing reads:
Based upon Agent Jones stated and apparent
authority to act on behalf of the U.S. government as a DHS agent
[and]... based upon the fact that Agent Jones repeatedly and
unequivocally told plaintiff and Mr. Oxford [his then-attorney] of his
ability and authority to assist plaintiff with the repatriation of his
bonds... plaintiff provided Agent Jones with fifteen (15) of the
at-issue bonds:
five (5) original bonds from each of the
three (3) metal containers, as well as the treasury-produced
authentication documents...
Surprisingly, Agent Jones refused to sign... [an] inventory, and he
refused to issue a general receipt to plaintiff indicating that he received
the bonds from plaintiff.
However, in that meeting, Agent Jones assured
plaintiff and Mr. Oxford that he would return the bonds to plaintiff after
he completed his investigation into the authenticity of the Bonds, and that
said investigation would take approximately one week to complete.
Because
they were meeting in DHS offices and given that Agent Jones had provided
valid identification and appeared to be a legitimate member of the Irvine,
CA DHS staff, plaintiff, upon advice of counsel, reluctantly provided the
bond samples to Agent Jones.
Riads lawsuit provides the court with what it claims are copies of Agent
Jones identification and business card as exhibits, as well as some email
communication exchanged between Riad and Jones.
After about a week, Riad claims, he was contacted by Agent Jones via email
and told that his bonds were not authentic.
After so much evidence to the
contrary, Riad claims that he demanded his bonds back from Jones, who
promptly refused, stating that he had destroyed them. It is then alleged
that Jones stated he could not explain his investigation methods and
procedures with anyone who did not have the proper clearance.
Fortunately
for Riad, Kermit Harmon, who had helped identify the bonds as authentic
earlier on, had such clearance.
Thus, Riad then demanded a face-to-face
meeting between Harmon and Jones. However, Jones subsequently refused to
continue discussing the matter any further with Riad or his then-lawyer, Mr.
Oxford, essentially killing the communication between them.
Riads lawsuit claims that Agent Jones is either currently in possession of
the bonds himself or has transferred them to a third party.
It states,
Retrospectively, it is clear that Agent Jones, while operating
under the actual and apparent authority that is inherent to his position as
a U.S. agent with the DHS, provided plaintiff with false and/or misleading
documents and information with the intent to illegally obtain the Bonds from
plaintiff.
The interplay between members of official government agencies and shadowy
individuals who seem to appear at just the right moment to develop trust,
only to then disappear back into the shadows after a large amount of
government bonds have been stolen, has popped up in the judicial system
twice now.
Indeed, this lawsuit bears traits very similar in nature to that
of the Dragon Family suit filed weeks ago.
Unfortunately, we will have to wait and see how the suit works its way
through the courts in order to see if any further information will come out
regarding world governments apparent attempt to prevent the theft of
legally owned bonds and prevent them from being exchanged outside of the
system it has designed as a rigged game.
If the suit is to be believed, it
will be interesting and quite revealing to witness the information brought
out in the courtroom as it runs its course.
Needless to say, Riads claims are certainly not unbelievable, especially
when one is dealing with such nefarious organizations as
the Federal Reserve
and the
Department of Homeland Security.
As it is, Riad is suing under the
Federal Tort Claims Act, for what he
alleges to be trespass, conversion and intentional representation.
Albert
Iacocca of West Chester, Pennsylvania is representing Riad in the case.
