Last weeks North Korean artillery barrage
against South Korea was a response to the arrest of
Yamaguchi gumi Yakuza syndicate number two
Kiyoshi Takayama.
Takayama was a senior North Korean agent in
Japan and his arrest was part of the dismantling of the North Korean spy
network in Japan. The arrest also marks a fundamental change in the secret
Japanese government and is part of a comprehensive defeat for the
Federal Reserve Board crime syndicate and their proxies. The Feds
have responded by trying to start a war in the Korean Peninsula.
They are also threatening to seize Japanese
owned-factories in North America, starting with Toyota and Honda.
In the meantime, anybody who has watched major bubbles (such as the Japanese
one) implode, know that just it is just a matter of time for both the
European and US financial systems to disintegrate. The mathematics simply do
not support either a continuation of the Euro nor a continuation of the
Federal Reserve Board under the current regime.
The crisis in the Euro has now moved from the imposition of impossible
conditions on the Greek peoples to similar impositions on the Irish.
The next targets will be Portugal, followed by
Spain, then the Baltic states, then Italy. Italy will take France down with it and that
will in turn hit Germany.
These countries populations cannot mathematically
support the banks attempts to keep their giant
ponzi scheme going much longer. Raising
taxes and lowering wages will mean shrinking economies which in turn will
mean the people will have less money to pay the banksters.
The obvious solution, as the people of Iceland
figured out, is to let the banks go bankrupt and thus free the European
peoples from debt slavery.
The head of the Bilderberg group, Viscount
Etienne Davignon, is promising to
support the White Dragon Society.
This would involve help in recovering the
over
$1 trillion in Asian assets, as well as considerable German and
Austrian assets stolen by certain individuals associated with the Davos
World Forum, the UN and
the OITC among others.
In the US, meanwhile, the Pentagon has made it very clear now it will not
support the banksters and the Satanists in their plans to kill the most
disobedient one-third of the US population via injection. Instead, the
military will watch the Washington D.C. corporate control grid disintegrate
further before they will consider conditions ripe for a military coup
against the unconstitutional US corporate government.
The one million or so Satanists who were part of
the plan to exterminate large numbers of Americans are still actively
seeking shelter elsewhere. The most likely destination now appears to be
Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile.
The
Bushes and their Moonie allies
have purchased vast ranches in
prime parts of Paraguay presumably in preparation for exactly the scenario
that is now unfolding.
However, there are many in the US who would
rather apprehend these people and make sure they face justice. Jesse
Ventura has apparently gone underground and is one of the leaders of the
military resistance.
Meanwhile, back in Japan, preparations are now underway for a major regime
change.
The scenario now being considered most likely in
the political world will be the dissolution of Parliament followed by a
general election possibly as early as January. At that point the Komeito
party will seek to ally itself with ruling Democratic Party of Japan
defectors and members of right-wing parties in a bid for power.
DPJ power broker Ichiro Ozawa is
considering having his considerable faction join that new grouping.
The arrest of Katayama mentioned in the opening paragraph was actually
instigated by insiders in the Japanese underworld as a part of the regime
change in the Japanese secret government. The new leadership structure of
the Yamaguchi gumi is now secret because intense police pressure is driving
them fully underground. Some sort of accommodation will have to be reached
with the official central government.
For now though, the Japanese underworld is
actively assisting the purge of Satanists from Japan.
The situation in the Korean peninsula will not be allowed to degenerate into
full-scale war. Instead, we will see more posturing as a part of secret
negotiations to unify North and South Korea. Russia, China, Japan and the US
have all insisted the cold war relic division of Korea be brought to an end.
As these and other events show, the signs are all there that the post World
War true global power structure is coming to an end. If we compare the
situation to the fall of the Soviet Union, we are now at the stage where
regime change in Poland seems imminent. In other words, things are just
starting to get intense.
The signs of the final result can be seen in many ways. The Russians have
shown a desire to enter a military and political alliance with Europe even
as they deepen their relations with China. The Turks have made it clear they
will fight Israel if they attack Lebanon.
The Americans and the Pentagon are reinventing
themselves as protectors of nations on the Chinese periphery. The Chinese,
for their part, are making friendly approaches to everybody.
The Satanists, meanwhile, are experiencing sheer
terror and helplessness.
