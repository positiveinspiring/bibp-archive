CIA
I never would have agreed to the formulation of the Central Intelligence
Agency back in forty-seven, if I had known it would become the American
Gestapo.
US President Harry S. Truman, 1961
The CIA, the NSA, the FBI and all other three letter, intelligence gathering,
secret keeping agencies mimic and are modeled after secret societies.
They
gather and filter information by compartmentalizing the organization in a
pyramid like hierarchical structure keeping everyone but the elite on a
need-to-know basis.
The CIA was born from the WWII intelligence arm, the OSS
(Office of Strategic Services), and was funded into permanence by the
Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations, which donated $34 million 194548
alone. Nearly every person instrumental in the creation of the CIA was
already a member of the CFR, including the Rockefellers and Dulles brothers.
In 1945 when the CIA was still the OSS, they began
Operation Paperclip which
brought over 700 Nazi scientists directly into the forming CIA, NSA, and
other high-level government organizations.
Since it was illegal to even allow
these Nazis into the US, let alone into top-secret government agencies, the
CIA convinced
the Vatican to issue American passports for these 700+ Nazi
scientists under the pretense that it was to keep them out of the hands of
the Russians.
After WWII ended in 1945, victorious Russian and American intelligence
teams began a treasure hunt throughout occupied Germany for military and
scientific booty. They were looking for things like new rocket and aircraft
designs, medicines, and electronics. But they were also hunting down the
most precious spoils of all: the scientists whose work had nearly won the
war for Germany. The engineers and intelligence officers of the Nazi War
Machine.
Following the discovery of flying discs (foofighters),
particle/laser beam weaponry in German military bases, the War Department
decided that NASA and the CIA must control this technology, and the Nazi
engineers that had worked on this technology. There was only one problem: it
was illegal. U.S. law explicitly prohibited Nazi officials from immigrating
to America and as many as three quarters of the scientists in question had
been committed Nazis.
Operation Paperclip Casefile: New World Order and
Nazi Germany
Hundreds of Nazi mind control specialists and doctors who performed horrific
experiments on prisoners instantly had their atrocious German histories
erased and were promoted into high-level American jobs.
Kurt Blome, for
instance, was a high-ranking Nazi scientist who experimented with plague
vaccines on concentration camp prisoners.
He was hired by the U.S. Army
Chemical Corps to work on chemical warfare projects.
Major General Walter
Schreiber was a head doctor during Nazi concentration camp prisoner
experiments in which they starved, and otherwise tortured the inmates. He
was hired by the Air Force School of Medicine in Texas.
Werner Von Braun was
technical director of the Nazi Peenemunde Rocket Research Center, where the
Germans developed the V2 rocket.
He was hired by the U.S. Army to develop
guided missiles and then made the first director of NASA!
Military Intelligence cleansed the files of Nazi references. By 1955,
more than 760 German scientists had been granted citizenship in the U.S. and
given prominent positions in the American scientific community. Many had
been longtime members of the Nazi party and the Gestapo, had conducted
experiments on humans at concentration camps, had used slave labor, and had
committed other war crimes.
In a 1985 expose in the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists Linda Hunt wrote that she had examined more than 130 reports on
Project Paperclip subjects and every one had been changed to eliminate the
security threat classification.
A good example of how these dossiers were
changed is the case of Werner von Braun. A September 18, 1947, report on the
German rocket scientist stated, Subject is regarded as a potential security
threat by the Military Governor.
The following February, a new security
evaluation of Von Braun said, No derogatory information is available on the
subject
It is the opinion of the Military Governor that he may not
constitute a security threat to the United States.

Shortly after Operation Paperclip came Operation Mockingbird, during which
the CIA trained reporters and created media outlets to disseminate their
propaganda.
One of Project Mockingbirds lead roles was played by Philip
Graham who would become publisher of The Washington Post. Declassified
documents admit that over 25 organizations and 400 journalists became CIA
assets which now include major names like ABC, NBC, CBS, AP, Reuters, Time,
Newsweek and more.
In 1953 the Iranian coup classified as Operation AJAX was the CIAs first
successful overthrow of a foreign government. In 1951 Iran Parliament and
Prime Minister Dr. Mohammed Mosaddeq voted for nationalizing their oil
industry which upset western oil barons like the Rockefellers. On April 4th,
1953, CIA director Allen Dulles transferred $1 million to Iranian General
Fazlollah Zahedi to be used in any way that would bring about the fall of
Mosaddeq.
Coup leaders first planted anti Mosaddeq propaganda throughout the
Iranian press, held demonstrations, and bribed officials. Then they began
committing terror attacks to blame on Mosaddeq hoping to bring public
sentiment away from their hero.
They machine-gunned civilians, bombed
mosques, and then passed out pamphlets saying,
Up with Mosaddeq, up with
Communism, down with Allah.
Zahedis coup took place between August 15th
and
19th
after which the CIA sent $5 million more for helping their new government
consolidate power.
Soon America controlled half of Irans oil production and
American weapons merchants moved in making almost $20 billion off Iran in
the next 20 years.
In 1953 the Central Intelligence Agency working in tandem with MI6
overthrew the democratically elected leader of Iran Dr. Mohammed Mosaddeq.
Mosaddeq had been educated in the west, was pro-America, and had driven
communist forces out of the north of his country shortly after being elected
in 1951.
Mosaddeq then nationalized the oil fields and denied British
Petroleum a monopoly. The CIAs own history department at CIA-Gov details
how U.S. and British intelligence agents carried out terror attacks and then
subsequently blamed them on Mosaddeq
The provocations included propaganda,
demonstrations, bribery, agents of influence, and false flag operations.
They bombed the home of a prominent religious leader and blamed it on
Moseddeq.
They attacked mosques, machine-gunned crowds, and then handed out
thousands of handbills claiming that Moseddeq had done it
Dr. Mohammed
Moseddeq, who was incarcerated for the duration of his life, fared better
than any of his ministers who were executed just days after the successful
coup for crimes that MI6 and the CIA had committed.

In 1954 the CIA performed its second coup detat overthrow of a foreign
democracy; this time it was Guatemala, whose popular leader Jacobo Arbenz
Guzman, had recently nationalized 1.5 million acres of land for the
peasants.
Before this, only 2.2% of Guatemalas landowners owned 70% of the
land, which included that of United Fruit Co. whose board of directors were
friends with the Dulles brothers and wanted to keep Guatemala a banana
republic.
So once again the CIA sent in propagandists and mercenaries,
trained militia groups, bombed the capital, and installed their puppet
dictator Castillo Armas, who the gave United Fruit Co. and the other 2.2%
landowners everything back. Military dictators ruled Guatemala for the next
30 years killing over 100,000 citizens. Guatemalan coroners were reported
saying they could not keep up with the bodies.
The CIA called it Operation
Success.
The CIA has overthrown functioning democracies in over twenty countries.
John Stockwell, former CIA official
They always follow the same strategy.
First, globalist interests are
threatened by a popular or democratically elected foreign leader; leaders
who help their populations nationalize foreign owned industries, protect
workers, redistribute wealth/land and other such actions loved by
the lower and middleclass majority, hated by the superrich minority. Next,
the CIA identifies and cooperates with opposition militia groups within the
country, promising them political power in trade for American business
freedom.
Then they are hired, trained and funded to overthrow the current
administration through propaganda, rigged elections, blackmail,
infiltration/disruption of opposition parties, intimidation, torture,
economic sabotage, death squads and assassinations. Eventually the CIA-backed
militia group stages a coup and installs their corporate sympathizer
dictator
and the former leaders are propagated as having been radicals or communists
and the rest of the world is taught to shrug and view American imperialism
as necessary world policing.
The CIA has now evolved this whole racket into
a careful science which they teach at the infamous School of the Americas.
They also publish books like The Freedom Fighters Manual and The Human
Resource Exploitation Training Manual teaching methods of torture,
blackmail, interrogation, propaganda and sabotage to foreign military
officials.
Starting in 1954 the CIA ran operations attempting to overthrow the
communist North Vietnamese government, while supporting the Ngo Dinh Diem
regime in South Vietnam.
From 19571973 the CIA conducted what has been
termed The Secret War in Laos during which they carried out almost one
coup per year in an effort to overthrow their democracy. After several
unsuccessful attempts, the US began a bombing campaign, dropping more
explosives and planting more landmines on Laos during this Secret War than
during all of World War II.
Untold thousands died and a quarter of the
Laotian people became refugees often living in caves.
Right up to the
present, Laotians are killed/maimed almost daily from unexploded landmines.
-
In 1959 the US helped install Papa Doc Duvalier, the Haitian dictator
whose factions killed over 100,000.
-
In 1961 CIA Operation Mongoose attempted
and failed to overthrow Fidel Castro.
-
Also in 1961 the CIA assassinated the
Dominican Republics leader Rafael Trujillo, assassinated Zaires
democratically elected Patrice Lumumba, and staged a coup against Ecuadors
President Jose Velasco, after which US President JFK fired CIA director
Allen Dulles.
-
In 1963 the CIA was back in the Dominican Republic and Ecuador
performing military coups overthrowing Juan Bosch and President Arosemana.
-
In 1964 another CIA-funded/armed coup overthrew Brazils
democratically elected Joao Goulart replacing him with Dictator General
Castelo Branco, CIA-trained secret police, and marauding death squads.
-
In
1965 the CIA performed coups in Indonesia and Zaire and installed oppressive
military dictators; General Suharto in Indonesia would then go on to
slaughter nearly a million of his countrymen.
-
In 1967 a CIA-backed coup
overthrew the government of Greece.
-
In 1968 they helped capture Che Guevara
in Bolivia.
-
In 1970 they overthrew Cambodias popular Prince Sahounek, an
action that greatly strengthened the once minor opposition Khmer Rouge party
who went on to murder millions.
-
In 1971 they backed a coup in Bolivia and
installed Dictator Hugo Banzer who went on torture and murder over 2000 of
his political opponents.
-
In 1973 they assassinated Chiles
democratically elected Salvador Allende and replaced him with General Augusto
Pinochet who murdered thousands of his civilians.
On and on it goes; The
Association for Responsible Dissent put out a report estimating that by
1987, 6 million people worldwide had died resulting from CIA covert ops.
Since then there have been many untold millions more.
Throughout the world, on any given day, a man, woman or child is likely to
be displaced, tortured, killed or disappeared, at the hands of governments
or armed political groups. More often than not, the United States shares the
blame.
Amnesty International annual report on U.S. Military aid and human
rights, 1996
1979-1989 CIA Operation Cyclone, with joint funding from Britains MI6,
heavily armed and trained over 100,000 Afghani Mujahideen (holy warriors)
during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. With the help of the Pakistani ISI (Inter Services
Intelligence), billions of dollars were given to create this Islamic army.
Selig Harrison from the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars
stated,
The CIA made a historic mistake in encouraging Islamic groups from
all over the world to come to Afghanistan. The US provided $3 billion [now
many more billion] for building up these Islamic groups, and it accepted
Pakistans demand that they should decide how this money should be spent
Today that money and those weapons have helped build up the Taliban
[who]
are now making a living out of terrorism.
Perhaps as Harrison stated, the CIA made a historic mistake in creating
these Jihadists, or perhaps they knew exactly what they were doing.
Recently
declassified DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) documents prove that the US
government was long aware of the ISIs sponsorship/creation of both the
Taliban and Al Qaeda
The United States has been part and parcel to supporting the Taliban all
along, and still is let me add
You have a military government in Pakistan
now that is arming the Taliban to the teeth
Let me note; that [US] aid has
always gone to Taliban areas
And when people from the outside try to put
aid into areas not controlled by the Taliban, they are thwarted by our own
State Department
Pakistan [has] initiated a major resupply effort, which
eventually saw the defeat, and caused the defeat, of almost all of the anti Taliban forces in Afghanistan.
Congressional Rep. Dana Rohrbacher, the
House International Relations Committee on Global Terrorism and South Asia,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stated before the House of Commons that
Al Qaeda is not actually a terrorist group, but a database of
international Mujahadden and arms dealers/smugglers used by the CIA to
funnel arms, money, and guerrillas.
The word Al Qaeda itself literally
translates to the database. Not only did the CIA create the Taliban and AlQaeda, they continued funding them right up to
the 9/11 attacks blamed on
them.
For example, four months prior to 9/11, in May, 2001, Colin Powell
gave another $43 million in aid to the Taliban.
Not even the corporate US media could whitewash these facts and so
explained it away by alleging that US officials had sought cooperation from
Pakistan because it was the original backer of the Taliban, the hard-line
Islamic leadership of Afghanistan accused by Washington of harboring Bin
Laden. Then the so called missing link came when it was revealed that the
head of the ISI was the principal financier of the 9/11 hijackers
Pakistan
and the ISI is the go between of the global terror explosion. Pakistan's
military intelligence apparatus, which literally created and sponsored the
Taliban and Al Qaeda, is directly upheld and funded by the CIA. These facts
are not even in dispute, neither in the media nor in government.
Therefore
when we are told by the neocon heads of the new world order that they are
doing everything in their power to dismantle the global terror network what
we are hearing is the exact opposite of the truth. They assembled it, they
sponsored it and they continue to fund it. As any good criminal should, they
have a middleman to provide plausible deniability, that middleman is the ISI
and the military dictatorship of Pakistan.
Steve Watson, U.S. Intel
Officer: Al Qaeda Leadership Allowed to Operate Freely (http://www.infowars.net/articles/july2007/160707ISI.htm)
Major
PierreHenri Bunel, a French military intelligence agent, who was
framed and convicted no doubt for daring to raise his voice in December,
2001, said,
The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group
called Al Qaeda. And any informed intelligence officer knows this. But there
is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an
identified entity representing the devil only in order to drive the TV
watcher to accept a unified international leadership for a war
against terrorism.
The country behind this propaganda is
the US and the lobbyists for the US war on terrorism are
only interested in making money.

In a late 1980s Newsweek article, outspoken opponent of
President Bush and recently assassinated Pakistani Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, told George Bush Sr.,
you are
creating a Frankenstein, concerning the growing Islamist
movement.
She also came out in 2007 to say that
Osama Bin Laden was already
long dead having been murdered by Omar Sheikh.
She was murdered a
month after the interview, only two weeks before the Pakistani 2008 general
elections.
