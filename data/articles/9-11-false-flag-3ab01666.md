Whereas Americans launch attacks relatively
quickly, first on Afghanistan and later on Iraq, using falsified evidence,
doubts about the official version of the events of September 11th grows.
The
speculations that surfaced on the internet directly after the attacks were
considered to be just wild conspiracy theories until this now. Yet the
circumstantial evidence and even the substantial evidence itself paints a
clear picture.
The responsibility for the terrible attacks seems to lie not
with Islamic Terrorists but with several high-ranking members of the
military and administration of the U.S. Government. This documentary focuses
on the inconsistencies in the official version of the events as well as on
the evidence which has been suppressed regarding September 11th.
In
addition, it answers the questions of why we still know nothing about it to
this day and why we are being deceived also in European countries.
