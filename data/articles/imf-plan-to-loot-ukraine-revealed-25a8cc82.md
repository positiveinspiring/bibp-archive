Ukraine partitioned into east and west,
like the division of
numerous post-World War II nations.
Readers will notice that on April 30, 2014, it
was posted
an analysis of the Western establishment's longtime approach of
containment and subversion in regards to Russia and its satellite nations.
One of those crucial strategic locales is
Ukraine, which has historically been an integral part of Russia.
Washington and its axis have sought to wrest
Ukraine from Russian influence to divide up the nation, loot the resources,
integrate Ukraine into the EU, and establish more military bases that
encroach upon the Rus.
In that article, I wrote as follows:
"The "democratic transformation" Brzezinski
is writing about is found in the phony, western-funded NGOs that have
sparked a host of "color revolutions" over the last few decades in
Middle Eastern and former Soviet satellite nations.
The goal is thus to flank Russia and
eventually "democratize" and McDonalidize Russia and its satellites even
further through perpetual social disorder, collapse, and GMO
cheeseburgers, just as the United States itself undergoes tyrannical
"democratization" from its degenerate, so-called elite.
This plan of Brzezinski to transform Russia
at the end of the 90s resulted in the Yeltsin regime, wherein a host of
former communist party oligarchs looted the nation through the Clinton
Administration's IMF 'aid.'
This 'aid' resulted in
500 billion being looted from the Russian people,
as well as the collapse of the Russian economy.
The same Clintonists that organized this
debacle through organized (NGO) crime also organized the banker bailout
of recent fame, through unending, repackaged derivatives scams."
The next day, Russia Today reported that the IMF
had approved a 17 billion dollar "aid" package to "stabilize" the economy of
Kiev.
RT wrote:
"The International Monetary Fund has
approved a two-year $17.1 billion loan package for Ukraine. The
immediate disbursement of $3.2 billion will allow Ukraine to avoid a
potential debt default.
The IMF's 24-member board agreed to the
two-year program to aid Ukraine's troubled economy on Wednesday.
The approval gives the green light for the
immediate release of $3.2 billion to Ukraine, which will allow the
nation not to fall into default, Reuters reports. More than half of that
money will be dedicated to supporting the country's budget.
The package will open up loans from other
donors totaling around $15 billion. The goal is for Ukraine to use the
money to stabilize its economy.
"The authorities' economic program supported
by the Fund aims to restore macroeconomic stability, strengthen economic
governance and transparency, and launch sound and sustainable economic
growth, while protecting the most vulnerable," the IMF said in a
statement.
IMF managing director Christine Lagarde
commented on the aid package, stating that the plan may come with
geopolitical and implementation risks.
"On
the implementation front, we are taking all the precautions we can
in order to mitigate those risks," Lagarde
told reporters on Wednesday.
"On
the geopolitical front, clearly the bilateral international support,
and the cooperation of all parties, will be extremely helpful to
reinforce the position of the economy of Ukraine."

Amazingly, this "aid" is simply the same plan of
IMF shock doctrine we have seen over and over, as Nobel winning economist
Joseph Stiglitz (former chief economist of the World Bank) revealed back
in 2001.
That revelation first appeared through BBC
reporter Greg Palast's famous article, 'The
Globalizer Who Came in From the Cold.'
The documents summarized there outline the
multi-layered plan the IMF takes to attack, destabilize and reorganize (ie,
loot) through "aid" packages that result in extensive debt slavery and
privatization.
Palast explains of the IMF plan in regard to
Russia in the 90s:
"Each nation's economy is individually
analyzed, then, says Stiglitz, the Bank hands every minister the same
exact four-step program.
Step One is Privatization - which Stiglitz
said could more accurately be called, 'Briberization.'
Rather than object to the sell-offs of state
industries, he said national leaders - using the World Bank's demands to
silence local critics - happily flogged their electricity and water
companies. 'You could see their eyes widen' at the prospect of 10%
commissions paid to Swiss bank accounts for simply shaving a few billion
off the sale price of national assets.
And the US government knew it, charges
Stiglitz, at least in the case of the biggest 'briberization' of all,
the 1995 Russian sell-off.
'The US Treasury view was this was great
as we wanted Yeltsin re-elected. We don't care if it's a corrupt
election. We want the money to go to Yeltzin' via kick-backs for his
campaign.
Stiglitz is no conspiracy nutter ranting
about Black Helicopters. The man was inside the game, a member of Bill
Clinton's cabinet as Chairman of the President's council of economic
advisors.
Most ill-making for Stiglitz is that the
US-backed oligarchs stripped Russia's industrial assets, with the effect
that the corruption scheme cut national output nearly in half causing
depression and starvation.
After briberization, Step Two of the
IMF/World Bank one-size-fits-all rescue-your-economy plan is 'Capital
Market Liberalization.' In theory, capital market deregulation allows
investment capital to flow in and out. Unfortunately, as in Indonesia
and Brazil, the money simply flowed out and out. Stiglitz calls this the
'Hot Money' cycle.
Cash comes in for speculation in real estate
and currency, then flees at the first whiff of trouble. A nation's
reserves can drain in days, hours.
And when that happens, to seduce speculators
into returning a nation's own capital funds, the IMF demands these
nations raise interest rates to 30%, 50% and 80%."
The Western axis has now implemented the latest
installment of the bankster attack pattern in Ukraine, with the approval of
17 billion fiat dollars, reminiscent of the 18 billion that took down the
Russian economy in 1998.
The 2000 fas.org online text of the US House of
Representative's "Russia's
Road to Corruption" noted of the 1990s Clintonista plan:
"On March 23, 1998, five months before the
Russian government's default on its international and domestic debts led
to the nation's complete economic collapse, Viktor Chernomyrdin was
fired as Prime Minister.
The allegations of corruption against him
had only reinforced the public impression that the policy of a handful
of powerful Russian officials was not the construction of a free
enterprise system, but rather the subversion of the public good through
crony capitalism.
The unexpected firing of Chernomyrdin, Vice
President Gore's partner in the highly visible Gore-Chernomyrdin
Commission, unnerved Clinton administration officials. They were just as
unprepared for the appointment of the little-known Sergei Kirienko to
replace Chernomyrdin.
Lawrence Summers, then Deputy Secretary of
the Treasury, had inauspiciously dubbed the outgoing Prime Minister's
deputies, Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais, 'the Dream Team.'
Summers' characterization epitomized the
wishful thinking of the administration, and its willful blindness to the
worsening reality in Russia.
As late as the summer of 1998, the Clinton
administration still failed to grasp the fundamental error of its policy
of funneling enormous amounts of money into a corrupt central
government.
Despite widespread rumors that Kirienko,
too, would soon be fired, the administration proposed nothing more than
pouring still more loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) into
Russia's central government.
Vice President Gore, Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin, and Summers set to work on an additional $18 billion U.S.
commitment to the IMF chiefly intended to support new lending to Russia.
The IMF riot comes to
Ukraine.
'We have a significant opportunity to use
the leverage of IMF financing to help the Russian government,' Rubin
wrote to then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich on July 28, 1998.
'The basics are all in the right direction,'
Stanley Fischer, the IMF's Deputy Managing Director, said the same day.
The
administration successfully forced the $18 billion through Congress.
The reality of the situation, however, was
that the Russian economy had already begun to collapse. The stock market
was plunging. The day before Rubin's letter to the Speaker of the House
and the IMF's blindly upbeat assessment, the market had suffered a 9%
drop.
'It's looking ugly,' said one Western economist on July 27.
Said another Western investment strategist:
'We're sitting and watching this in
shock and horror.'
Over the next two weeks, the deterioration
continued. Finally, on August 17 - one month after the latest bailout - the
roof caved in.
The Russian government announced that it
would no longer be able to pay its official debts. The ruble was
devalued at the same time. The default, coupled with the devaluation of
the ruble after years of promises that this would not occur, led to
Russia's total economic collapse - a cataclysm by all measurements worse
than America's Crash of 1929.
The end of Soviet Communism had afforded the
United States its greatest foreign policy opportunity since the Allied
victory in World War II. Barely six years later Russia's economy lay in
ruins - an opportunity lost."
It doesn't take a genius to see that the same
plan of "aid" that collapsed the Russian economy of the 90s will not assist
Ukraine, unless by "assist" one means assist in its destruction.
Criminals operate with the same modus
operandi making it relatively easy to notice the pattern of destruction
the western axis will inevitably unleash as it seeks to implement its
version of the new world order.
The austerity introduced into EU nations
like Greece will now be the norm for Ukraine.
RT continues:
"Lagarde argued that Ukraine has already
shown its ability to undertake 'comprehensive reforms', listing
a few of the sacrifices that have been made.
'Whether it was a question of letting the exchange rate float, whether
it was a question of reforming the procurement law, whether it was a
question of modifying the price of gas to customers or to corporate.
They've (Ukrainian government) done all these things to demonstrate
their determination to endorse a very bold program of reforms,' Lagarde
stated.
The IMF money comes with stringent terms,
asking for various cuts and economic reforms.
In the case of Ukraine, the requirements
include a 50 percent increase in the price of gas for households, as
well as a quick pension reform and lower government spending."
Palast's article elucidates the attack pattern
in its next stages, as readers can expect to see the same in the Ukraine for
the near future:
"At this point, the IMF drags the gasping
nation to Step Three: Market-Based Pricing, a fancy term for raising
prices on food, water and cooking gas. This leads, predictably, to
Step-Three-and-a-Half: what Stiglitz calls, 'The IMF riot.'
The IMF riot is painfully predictable. When
a nation is,
'down and out, [the IMF] takes advantage and squeezes the
last pound of blood out of them. They turn up the heat until, finally,
the whole cauldron blows up,' as when the IMF eliminated food and fuel
subsidies for the poor in Indonesia in 1998.
Indonesia exploded into riots, but there are
other examples - the Bolivian riots over water prices last year and this
February, the riots in Ecuador over the rise in cooking gas prices
imposed by the World Bank. You'd almost get the impression that the riot
is written into the plan.
And it is...
What Stiglitz did not know is
that, while in the States, BBC and The Observer obtained several
documents from inside the World Bank, stamped over with those pesky
warnings, 'confidential,' 'restricted,' 'not to be disclosed.'
Let's get back to one: the 'Interim Country
Assistance Strategy' for Ecuador, in it the Bank several times states - with cold accuracy
- that they expected their plans to spark, 'social
unrest,' to use their bureaucratic term for a nation in flames.
That's not surprising. The secret report
notes that the plan to make the US dollar Ecuador's currency has pushed
51% of the population below the poverty line. The World Bank
"Assistance" plan simply calls for facing down civil strife and
suffering with, 'political resolve' - and still higher prices.
The IMF riots (and by riots I mean peaceful
demonstrations dispersed by bullets, tanks and teargas) cause new
panicked flights of capital and government bankruptcies.
This economic arson has it's bright side -
for foreign corporations, who can then pick off remaining assets, such
as the odd mining concession or port, at fire sale prices."
As veteran researcher Dr. Paul Craig
Roberts explains, the propaganda will certainly increase,
characterizing Russia as the invasive aggressor:
"With Obama's incompetent White House and
State Department having botched Washington's takeover of Ukraine,
Washington has been at work shifting the blame to Russia.
According to Washington and
its presstitute media, the protests are
orchestrated by the Russian government and have no sincere basis.
If Russia sends in military units to protect
the Russian citizens in the former Russian territories, the act will be
used by Washington to confirm Washington's propaganda of a Russian
invasion (as in the case of Georgia), and Russia will be further
demonized."
I was able to call the IMF plan because the IMF
plan is always the same.
The Anglo global elite must destroy any and every
nation to implement their global socialist technocracy. The technocracy is
the friend of no tribe or peoples, and the bankers and looters who propagate
this system are blind to their own good, as well as that of their posterity.
But when you're
an economic hit man (or woman) brimming with hated and
narcissistic self-interest, international looting scams are euphoric.
