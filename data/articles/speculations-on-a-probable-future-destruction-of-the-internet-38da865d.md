Kenitra, Internet
after all is not without enemies
The Internet has become the Archimedean point in our daily life.
Almost nothing gets done without it nowadays.
The more we rely on it, the more it seems impossible to live without it. It
is undoubtedly the most reliable machine Man has ever made.
However,
-
Could this blind dependence of ours in
itself be a threat to mankind?
-
Are we investing too much in this new
medium that we are risking to lose too much if we ever were to live
without it?
-
Why is the Internet so successful?
-
How does it invade all aspects of life?
The Internet, as a matter of fact, is the only
manmade machine that has an organic structure.
The way everything is wired up is unbelievably
complex. Seeing that it has this organic structure, it seems to fit the
properties of vitalism perfectly, and all aspects of human daily life.
It fits the structure of society and how people
connect to each other.
Life spreads by networking. The body itself
is an information processor. Memory resides not just in brains but in
every cell. No wonder genetics bloomed along with information theory.
Gleick (2011:07)
Every newly added part, be it a computer or a
smart-phone for example, fits perfectly within the larger whole of the
global network without disrupting the function of the rest of its parts,
just like organic living cells.
This is because,
"the whole is greater than the sum of its
parts"
(Aristotle 384-22 BC).
Besides, the Internet could also be seen as a
virtual reduplication of society and reality as a whole.
Therefore, it enjoys social compatibility. The
Internet is capable of acquiring new intelligences, which is an aspect of
the human brain.
There is always room for improvement, but if its
success is not due to its organic structure, then maybe it is due to the
fact that Internet is an efficient tool that circulates, measures, organizes
and processes information, boosting human knowledge.
Thus, the Internet is unique for its potential
to store and easily access human knowledge and above all, its promise for
the ideal democracy.
Most people go about their daily lives as if
Internet has always been here and always will be.
However, its success and mere presence are not
proof of its permanence. It would be unwise to think it will always be
around.
Actually, we have no guarantee that it will. It
is evident that it is so reliable but yet at the same time it is so
vulnerable. Its destruction is a legitimate probability although there isnt
much fuss about it.
Thanks to its omnipresence, the Internet has redefined the concept of
power. On one hand it has empowered the people; structured them and
unified their voices. Power is no longer strictly identified by missiles and
bullets, but rather by ideas and people. On the other hand, the Internet has
also empowered governments. It has enabled them with new ways of censoring,
controlling, and manipulating people.
This makes the thousands-years-long strife
between governments and citizens even more intense.
this has obviously empowered individuals in
a broad and complex set of ways, but as our lives become more and more
dependent on the internet, it has also provided governments with a
single point of contact for nearly ubiquitous surveillance. Kevin Drum
(2013)
The Internet plays in favor of both parties.
This can make the suppressed and overpowered
party, be it the citizen or government, target the very same weapon with
which the one in power exerts power. Using Egypt as an example, it is almost
unthinkable to picture the Egyptian uprising without social networking.
When the government awoke to the danger of the
people protesting, they immediately shut down the Internet and cellphone
services as a form of resistance on January 28th 2011, OECD (2013:36).
In contrast, a worldwide rage among citizens of some countries is growing
over the fact that their governments are trying to sensor the Internet.
Consequently, movements and organizations such as Anonymous and
Wikileaks have emerged and threatened many governments as well as
Internet security.
The possibilities are endless to what
the masses can do when they are upset, as
history has shown.
It would, perhaps, be shocking for citizens
of respected democratic states to discover that foreign forces were
influencing their lives in small but meaningful ways. Its a universal
issue and one that is highly controversial by its nature and though its
sheer audacity.
Bilal Khalid (2012)
In the two given examples above, it is shown how
governments and citizens alike can constitute a threat to Internet
stability.
It seems it is the Internet that is primarily
targeted whenever one party reacts. This sort of struggle between
governments and the people is not ending anytime soon, and it can, and may,
have huge repercussion with the presence of the Internet in the near future
if things escalated.
Now, with that being said, and since
globalization is pushing us towards a single one-world government, let us
apply this small incident of Egypt on a larger scale.
-
What would happen if all citizens were
at odds with the governments over power?
-
Similarly, what if the Internet granted
citizens unconditional freedom that would threaten the firm grasp
governments have over their people?
-
Wouldnt the Internet be susceptible of
being the cost of this struggle for control?
-
Wouldnt it be, and maybe it is, the
battlefield that is at the risk of its own destruction?
Weapons by nature inherently bear the seeds of
their own destruction, and the Internet is being used as a weapon - a very
vulnerable one.
No one would care about the survival of the
Internet as long as its survival intervenes with ones own interests.
Internet after all is not without enemies. The more technology advances, the
more we meet those longing for antiquity and the medieval life when things
used to be simple.
Ultimately,
-
If the Internet were really to be
destructed, it would be destructed not despite of, but because of
its success.
-
If the threat does not come from amongst
ourselves, it can very well come from the outside.
While browsing the Internet we dont worry about
whats happening in the center of our galaxy or on the surface of the sun.
Getting used to seeing the sun rises every
morning at a precise and predictable time makes us forget that the earth is
actually floating in a violent and brutal universe filled with random comets
and asteroids.
Space Weather, for example, can have great
impact on the global communication system, which could potentially put the
entire global connectivity at the mercy of space.
Not long ago in 1998, several satellites blacked
out simultaneously
because of a sun flare and many services
went down instantly such as web pages and TV channels. Add to that, 12
satellites so far have been lost because of space weather, ESA (2004:05).
We are
affected by the suns mood whether we like
it or not.
We can be subject to a future massive solar
flare just like we are subject to the suns rays. The most gigantic one,
known as
the Carrington Flare, took place in 1859.
It crippled the telegraphic communication all across North America and
Europe.
Computer engineers and space physicists are well
aware of what a solar flare the size of Carrington would do to todays
extremely vulnerable communication infrastructure.
A major solar event could theoretically melt
down the whole Internet. What earthquakes, bombs, and terrorism cannot
do might be accomplished in moments by a solar corona.
Eagleman (2012)
Electromagnetic storms are very common too.
Quebecs power went down in 1989 for 9 hours
because of one - affecting 6 million peoples lives. The cause of this
geomagnetic storm was a Coronal Mass Ejection from the sun that took place
on March 9th, 1989 and did not reach earth until 4 days
after.
From the micro perspective, IBM estimates that
there is a new software error every month in every 256 MB of computer RAM
caused by cosmic rays (Ziegler and Lanford, 1979:19-40, Tom 2008) despite
the earths magnetic shield. These cosmic rays are unstoppable charged
particles with high energies originating from the depth of space or the
center of the Milky Way.
Now with the increase of chips miniaturization (Moores
law), errors are expected to increase (Tom, 2008) since
electronic components will increasingly be affected by cosmic rays. Let
alone the worst-case scenario if the flux of cosmic rays increased. This
confirms the weak spot communication technologies have vis-Ã -vis outer
space.
The earth magnetic field, which serves as a
shield that protects the earth from violent solar flares, has been weakened
the past decade.
This is because the earth, as some scientists
believe, is at the verge of a probable
pole magnetic reversal (Wicherink,
2008:150), which is not an unprecedented event in the long history of earth.
Thus, the current weak magnetic field and the vulnerability of our global
communication infrastructure put the Internet at a greater risk of
disappearing.
On-going events of space weather can be
predicted but only a few days ahead, and there isnt much we can about them.
The Internet can be damaged in different ways. If the damage is not physical
it could be virtual. Cyber-warfare and cyber-terrorism arent fictional
concepts but real ones. Because the Internet will own every bit, and because
every datum is connected to one single organism, the whole thing is at the
risk of disappearing in bulk and at once.
One single virus might have the potential of
damaging every bit connected to the gigantic web.
We are living in a digital age in which any new piece of information is
primarily poured into the internet, if not born in it already, before being
committed to paper. In that sense, Internet is not a bunch of wires and
servers connecting people, but there is more to it than just that.
The Internet has become humanitys huge
database that hosts human knowledge.
It follows that whatever harms the Internet
would inevitably lead to the loss of human knowledge.
Ironically, one important consequence of the
shift to digital publishing is that it leads to a potential loss of
knowledge.
Curt Rice (2013).
Such a horrible event is not unprecedented in
human history.
Civilizations, such as the antediluvian
civilizations, lost a massive wealth of knowledge in the remote prehistory (Bauval
and Graham, 1996). Even more recently, a similar event took place in
Alexandria with the destruction of the
Royal Library of Alexandria (391 AD), which
was the hub of knowledge in the ancient world.
The Internet has proved to be efficient in processing and storing human
knowledge, yet it hasnt proved to be stable, permanent, or sustainable. The
only reasonable way to store human knowledge is to diversify the means of
storage, which is not something being seriously taken into
consideration.
Gathering and centralizing human knowledge into
the-binary-system medium isnt a cleaver idea. With all due respect to
Claude Shannon, a backup storage with a medium of a different nature
should be going in parallel; books for example.
-
Why are we in a state of heedlessness
about the probability that the Internet may not be around in the
future?
-
Is it because we never contemplate the
idea of a world without Internet although it always used to be the
case?
When asked the question:
"What is life to you without internet?" some
people responded: Life then would be "without colors," "very slow,"
"tasteless," "lifeless," or "I would feel locked up in a cell."
According to these sorts of reactions, which may
be the case for the majority, life seems nihilistic without Internet.
Is it possible that the Internet has given new
meaning to life?
Probably, because it seems as if the Internet
has shifted from being a means to being an end in itself, and the slogan
nowadays has become,
"I am on-line therefore I am".
It seems we are putting our entire human worth
and essence into a lifeless machine.

The Internet has empowered people; it has
empowered nations, bridged gaps and brought the world together. However
it is now being used to tear the world apart.
Bilal Khalid (2012)
All in all, what does this change?
What sort of attitude should we adopt if we were
to approach Internet as something temporary in our life in particular, and
in human history in general?
