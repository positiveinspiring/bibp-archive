The seeds for President
Obamas demagogic press
conference on Thursday were planted last summer when he assigned his
right-wing
Committee of 13 the role of resolving the obvious and inevitable
Congressional budget standoff by forging an anti-labor policy that cuts
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and uses the savings to bail out
banks from even more loans that will go bad as a result of the IMF-style
austerity program that Democrats and Republicans alike have agreed to back.
The problem facing Mr. Obama is obvious enough:
How can he hold the support of moderates and
independents (or as Fox News calls them, socialists and
anti-capitalists), students and labor, minorities and others who
campaigned so heavily for him in 2008?
He has double-crossed them - smoothly, with a
gentle smile and patronizing patter talk, but with an iron determination to
hand federal monetary and tax policy over to his largest campaign
contributors:
Wall Street and assorted special interests -
the Democratic Partys Rubinomics and Clintonomics core operators, plus
smooth Bush Administration holdovers such as Tim Geithner, not to
mention quasi-Cheney factotums in the Justice Department.
President Obamas solution has been to do what
any political demagogue does:
Come out with loud populist campaign
speeches that have no chance of becoming the law of the land, while
quietly giving his campaign contributors what theyve paid him for:
giveaways to Wall Street, tax cuts for the wealthy (euphemized as tax
exemptions and mark-to-model accounting, plus an agreement to count
their income as capital gains taxed at a much lower rate).
So heres the deal the Democratic leadership has
made with the Republicans.
The Republicans will run someone from their
present gamut of guaranteed losers, enabling Mr. Obama to run as the voice
of reason, as if this somehow is Middle America.
This will throw the 2012
election his way for a second term if he adopts their program - a set of
rules paid for by the leading campaign contributors to both parties.
President Obamas policies have not been the voice of reason.
They are even
further to the right than
George W. Bush could have achieved. At least a
Republican president would have confronted a Democratic Congress blocking
the kind of program that Mr. Obama has rammed through. But the Democrats
seem stymied when it comes to standing up to a president who ran as a
Democrat rather than the Tea Partier he seems to be so close to in his
ideology.
So heres where the Committee of 13 comes into play.
Given,
-
the agreement that if the Republicans
and Democrats do NOT agree on Mr. Obamas dead-on-arrival
job-creation ploy
-
and Republican House Leader Boehners
statement that his party will reject the populist rhetoric that
President Obama is voicing these days
-
then the Committee will get its chance
to wield its ax and cut federal social spending in keeping with its
professed ideology
President Obama signaled this long in advance,
at the outset of his administration when he appointed his Deficit Reduction
Commission headed by former Republican Sen. Simpson and Rubinomics advisor
to the Clinton administration Bowles to recommend how to cut federal social
spending while giving even more money away to Wall Street.
He confirmed suspicions of a sellout by
reappointing bank lobbyist Tim Geithner to the Treasury, and tunnel-visioned
Ben Bernanke as head of the
Federal Reserve Board.
Yet on Wednesday, October 4, the president tried to represent the
OccupyWallStreet movement as support for his efforts. He pretended to
endorse a pro-consumer regulator to limit bank fraud, as if he had not
dumped Elizabeth Warren on the advice of Mr. Geithner - who seems to be
settling into the role of bagman for campaign contributors from Wall Street.
Can President Obama get away with it? Can he jump in front of the parade and
represent himself as a friend of labor and consumers while his appointees
support Wall Street and his Committee of 13 is waiting in the wings to
perform its designated function of guillotining Social Security?
When I visited the OccupyWallStreet site on Wednesday, it was clear that the
disgust with the political system went so deep that there is no single set
of demands that can fix a system so fundamentally broken and dysfunctional.
One cant paste-up a regime that is impoverishing the economy, accelerating
foreclosures, pushing state and city budgets further into deficit, and
forcing cuts in social spending.
The situation is much like that from Iceland to Greece:
Governments no longer represent the people.
They represent predatory financial interests
that are impoverishing the economy. This is not democracy. It is financial
oligarchy. And oligarchies do not give their victims a voice.
So the great question is, where do we go from here?
Theres no solvable path within the way that the
economy and the political system is structured these days. Any attempt to
come up with a neat fix-it plan can only suggest bandages for what looks
like a fatal political-economic wound.
The Democrats are as much a part of the septic disease as the Republicans.
Other countries face a similar problem. The Social Democratic regime in
Iceland is acting as the party of bankers, and its governments approval
rating has fallen to 12 percent. But they refuse to step down.
So earlier last week, voters brought steel oil
drums to their own Occupation outside the Althing and banged when the Prime
Minister started to speak, to drown out her advocacy of the bankers (and
foreign vulture bankers at that!).
Likewise in Greece, the demonstrators are showing foreign bank interests
that any agreement the European Central Bank makes to bail out French and
German bondholders at the cost of increasing taxes on Greek labor (but not
Greek property and wealth) cannot be viewed as democratically entered into.
Hence, any debts that are claimed, and any real
estate or public enterprises given sold off to the creditor powers under
distress conditions, can be reversed once voters are given a democratic
voice in whether to impose a decade of poverty on the country and force
emigration.
That is the spirit of civil disobedience that is growing in this country. It
is a quandary - that is, a problem with no solution. All that one can do
under such conditions is to describe the disease and its symptoms.
The cure will follow logically from the
diagnosis.
The role of OccupyWallStreet is to diagnose the
financial polarization and corruption of the political process that extends
right into the Supreme Court, the Presidency, and Mr. Obamas soon-to-be
notorious Committee of 13 once the happy-smoke settles from his present
pretensions.
