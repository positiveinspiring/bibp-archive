There is an estimated 366 million, trillion
gallons of water on planet Earth.
That number appears to be fixed, according
to UNESCOs
Intergovernmental Council of the International Hydrological Program
(HIP). The alarmist threat of man-made climate change states that where and
how this water manifests itself in hydraulic flux across our biosphere is
questionable.
The HIP are a UN program system devoted to
researching and finding natural water resources and managing those resources
found. While the UN is well aware that the necessity of water as a vital
source for life means the retention of power over all life, they are well
into their schemes to develop global governance over all sources of fresh,
clean water.
The IPCC document
HS
15332 Climate Change Impacts - Securitization of Water, Food, Soil, Health,
Energy and Migration explains how the UN plans to secure resources to
use at their disposal.
Through the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
under-developed countries are forced to sell their resources to
the
Global
Elite as full cost recovery to the global central bankers.
Once those
resources
are under the complete control of the IMF they become assets to be
reallocated back to the enslaved nations for a price.
This scheme makes water sources under central
privatization cost more and become less accessible to those who desperately
need it. Water prices rise while the quality of it diminishes. This forces
natives in places like South Africa and India to collect water from polluted
streams and rivers, which compromises their health.
The cycle in complete
when those who had their water stolen from them through coercion die from
contaminated water that they were forced to use.
If the alarmist view is taken as fact
(regardless of the empirical data to disprove it), then rising sea levels
will somehow allow more water to evaporate in the atmosphere, lowering water
table levels dramatically. Estimations state that hydro-electric dams, like
the Hoover Dam, would cease generating electricity by 2024.
While some areas on Earth, under climate change
computer models, are expected to become wetter, some are equally expected to
become drier.
The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) claims that from research flooding
worldwide takes an estimated 25,000 lives and is responsible for economic
loses that add up to $60 billion annually.
Reworking of highways to elevated areas and
moving infrastructure from coastlines are a challenge for alarmist
engineers. Relying on policymakers and behavioral shifts are at the core of
the alarmist perspective. Cities must evolve from out-of-control consumerism
to eco-friendly examples of moderation, just as we see in
Transition Towns.
Engineers and planners, working with
Agenda 21 policies in mind, are devising ecosystem-based responses to
protecting the biodiversity of land and animals under the guidelines set
forth by the UN.
When it comes to land conservation, the UN is explicit as
to how they want to ensure its success. Schemes that are devised to meter
the output of resources and control how much is used by an individual are
being made available to governments through allocation of taxpayer money
under the direction of the UN Sustainable Development initiatives and
Millennium Development Goals.
Over the past two decades, scientists have been
using a cheap method called
ocean
fertilization that is the dumping of iron dust into the oceans in order
to stimulate the growth of CO2 breathing phytonplankton.
Under guidelines of
UNESCO, ocean fertilization is conducted under the assumption that they are
adding nutrients, or increasing the nutrient supply from deep waters when
really they are polluting the oceans with a toxic metal.
Small scale experiments have confirmed that iron
seeding of the oceans does promote the phytonplanktons growth. Yet, ocean
fertilization causes catastrophic effects, such as creating oxygen-depleted
dead zones in the worlds oceans.
The
Royal Society, who supports these seeding oceans efforts, admits that
the deduction of CO2 it would facilitate is a negligible 10 parts per
million which would not have any real impact on global temperatures.
J. Gary Lawrence, adviser to former President
Clintons Council on Sustainable Development
said :
Participating in a UN advocated planning
process would very likely bring out many of the conspiracy- fixated
groups and individuals in our society.
This segment of our society who
fear one-world government and a UN invasion of the United States
through which our individual freedom would be stripped away would
actively work to defeat any elected official who joined the conspiracy
by undertaking [Agenda 21].
So we call our process something else, such
as comprehensive planning, growth management or smart growth.
Local governments and municipalities are
utilizing the capture of rain-water under strict regulation.
It is not meant
for any individual to capture rain-water for private use. The community as a
whole, under Agenda 21 control and distribute water resources to all; as
long as there is enough. Watersheds, controlled by local governments who
adhere to Agenda 21 policies would control who gets access to water, how
much and how much it will cost the individual.
The UN Environmental Program (UNEP) in a
UN-Water Survey of 130 Countries Status Report have forced reformation
through international water laws that apply pressure under the guise of expanding
populations, urbanization and climate change.
While clean drinking water
for humans is controlled, improvements designed to ensure freshwater
reserves for the ecosystem are first and foremost.
Management and use of water under the
international agreement known as Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)
was back at the 1992 UN Conference on Sustainable Development. This is a
part of
the Agenda 21 plan.
Cooperation of the UNEP and the UN-Water, an
inter-agency mechanism to control freshwater resources, relates UN policies
to governments on how to allocate their assets.
Achim Steiner, UN Under-Secretary-General and UNEP executive director, said:
The sustainable management and use of water
due to its vital role in food security, energy or supporting valuable
ecosystem services underpins the transition to a low-carbon, resource
efficient green economy.
Steiner believes that integrating UN policies
for water resource management will facilitate a sustainable approach to
water. The needs of the global population, which is expected to rise to 9
billion by 2050, will demand total governance.
The UN blames population growth combined with
communities in rural areas increase the necessity of stricter guidelines to
avert,
climactic and socio=political disasters.
The UN suggests that by 2015 all countries
develop financing strategies and action programs that adhere to the IWRM.
They want all nations to report to the UNEP concerning water resources
management so that the UN can assess their progress and make changes as they
see fit.
Simply put, the securitization of water on a
global scale, will be run by
the United
Nations only.
Their target recommendations will
then be directed to individual governments to be made into laws. The
citizens of those nations will have no choice but to follow the laws of
their countries; if they are to get their ration of life-giving water.
Even in industrialized nations, this will mean
the difference between access to fresh, clean water and having to use
polluted water sources which threaten our health and well-being.
