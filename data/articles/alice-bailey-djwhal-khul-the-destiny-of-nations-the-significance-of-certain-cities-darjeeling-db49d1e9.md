I would like here to interpolate some remarks. It is of deep moment to realize that Great Britain and the United States are closely related; that this relation makes certain realities and activities inevitable once the soul of each nation is functioning potently. India and Great Britain are also related through this first Ray personality of Great Britain and the soul ray of India. The implications are clear and interesting and also encouraging. The consciousness aspect of the British people is steadily shifting into an expression of their second ray soul and hence their seizing upon the opportunity at this time to serve humanity at immense cost. The same thing is happening to the American people. The problem of shifting idealism is great, as I have said, and the temptation is to hide behind the glamor of fighting for an ideal rather than react to world need, and omit to react to the ray of the soul which is the second ray of love.
