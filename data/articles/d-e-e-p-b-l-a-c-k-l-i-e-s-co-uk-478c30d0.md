Dr.
Kurt Waldheim - second from the left, during
WW11. Waldheim is the former Austrian President
and UN Secretary General who hit the headlines in 1994
following an unexpected release of documents by the US
Justice Department that cited Waldheim's involvement
in the "deportation, mistreatment and execution
of civilians and Allied soldiers in World War
11." If one believes coincidences of this
order do occur naturally, then it is a sheer
coincidence that this story hit the headlines (N Y
Times) on 13 March 1994 - the exact time frame that
the Russbacher/Waldheim gold deal was nearing completion
(the letter from the Central Bank of the
Philippines to Dr. Werner Metz at the Austrian Central
Bank was signed 15 March 1994).
