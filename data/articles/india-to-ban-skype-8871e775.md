Intelligence agencies have asked the government to consider blocking Skype.
The popular global VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) engine are refusing
to share the encryption code that prevents Indian investigators from
intercepting conversations of suspected terrorists.
During the 26/11 Mumbai attacks VOIP was extensively used by the terrorist
to communicate with their bosses, which made it extremely difficult for the
security agencies to track the terrorists and intercept their calls.
Most VOIP providers, use an encryption mechanism to encode the voice message
while transmitting the messages, this is done to prevent anyone from
illegally getting into someone else conversation. But this encryption also
proves to be a hassle for all the security agencies, as it prevents them
from intercepting call also.
The Cabinet Committee on Security has accepted the recommendation in
principle but has not set a date for initiating action.
Since Skype is not
registered in India, Indian authorities will have to block the gateways
here. to prevent Skype from working, however this might not be a complete
solution, Skype can route traffic through other service providers.
What surprises me is what prevents Skype from sharing the code with India,
when it has already done so with the US and China. If its in the interest of
the nation, its should be justified.
Spooks Want Government to Block Skype

Intelligence agencies have asked the government to consider
blocking Skype as operators of the popular global VoIP (Voice over Internet
Protocol) engine are refusing to share the encryption code that prevents
Indian investigators from intercepting conversations of suspected
terrorists.
The Cabinet Committee on Security has accepted the recommendation in
principle but has not set a date for initiating action. The urgency to track Skype calls stems from the fact that terrorists - as the
26/11 attacks in
Mumbai showed - are increasingly using VoIP services.
The shift to VoIP has
been prompted by the growing ability of intelligence agencies to intercept
mobile and other calls.
Like the BlackBerry service, VoIP operators send their signals under a
specific code which makes it difficult for others to decipher. Sources said
Skype has shared its encryption code with the US, China and other
governments but is refusing to accept similar Indian requests.
Since Skype is not registered here, Indian authorities have been forced to
mull the drastic option of blocking its gateways here. This, however, may
not be entirely effective as Skype can route traffic through other service
providers. The agencies feel blocking the gateways will at least serve as a
signal to local service providers against carrying traffic from Skype or any
other similar service provider which does not share the encryption code with
the government.
Sections 4 and 5 of the Telegraph Act gives government the right to grant
license for any kind of telephony and also the right to intercept.
Last
year, government amended Section 69 of the Information Technology Act to
empower itself to take over servers of Net and telecom service providers and
demand the encryption code.
This may still be no remedy against recalcitrant
overseas service providers who usually have their servers abroad.
Last year,
the government had a similar run-in with,
Indian agencies are also keeping their fingers crossed, not sure whether the
department of telecom - with a stake in sectoral growth - would like to
lean on VoIP service providers on the issue of sharing encryption code.
Besides, there's also a feeling that the government would be wary of
people's response to the snapping of Skype. The free service is used by a
vast majority of urban middle class Indians for communicating with families
and friends spread across the world.
Last year,
TRAI had sent a recommendation (with data from 2007), that
Skype
and Goggle should be asked to pay a license fee, after being brought within
the license regime.
However, government turned it down saying they were not
based in India.
