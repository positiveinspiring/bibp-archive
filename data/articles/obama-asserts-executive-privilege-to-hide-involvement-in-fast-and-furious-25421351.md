In a vein effort to cover his tracks and protect his cohorts, President
Barack Obama is claiming executive privilege regarding Fast and Furious
(F&F) documents that expose their operation to smuggle weapons into Mexico
by way of US agents that were handed off directly to Mexican drug cartels.
The House Oversight Committee (HOC), headed by Chair Darrell Issa, is flat
out demanding that classified and undisclosed documents that show the
Department of Justice (DoJ) and Attorney General Eric Holder were directly
involved with the F&F operation.
Just as the Oversight Committee votes on holding Holder in contempt or not,
Obama claims a thinly veiled retreat; perhaps to mitigate his exposed
connection to the DoJs involvement in the ruined operation.
Holder had attempted to subvert responsibility by offering to negotiate with
Congress; yet Issa refused, moving forward with a motion for contempt of
Congress.
Issa asserts:
The committee has uncovered serious wrongdoing by the Justice
Department. That wrongdoing has cost lives on both sides of the border.
James Cole, Deputy Attorney General for the DoJ, wrote a letter to Issa
acknowledging Holders,
failure to comply with the Committees subpoena of
October 11, 2011 however they claim they have made an extraordinary effort
to accommodate the Committees legitimate oversight interests and provided
over 7,600 pages of documents and has made numerous high-level officials
available for public congressional testimony, transcribed interviews, and
briefings.
The DoJ is choosing to call out their authority and hope to intimidate the
HOC into ceasing all pursuant activity.
By citing that the DoJs Attorney
General has opened an investigation in F&F, and that it is ongoing,
supplants nothing. It only ensures by their words that getting caught during
a covert operation will not occur again.
Holder and Obama have been discussing how to handle the F&F scandal.
Choosing to hide under the cover of US presidency has only stood to fuel
questions about Obamas participation, knowledge and role in the operation.
Earlier this week, Holder advised Obama to use his executive privilege card
concerning the internal documents of the F&F operations that would,
have
significant, damaging consequences.
Holder went on to explain that handing over the documents to Congress,
would
inhibit candor of such Executive Branch deliberations in the future and
significantly impair the Executive Branchs ability to respond independently
and effectively to congressional oversight.
In an effort to downplay Obamas use of executive privilege,
Eric Schultz,
White House spokesman said:
dating back to President Reagan, presidents
have asserted executive privilege 24 times. President Obama has gone longer
without asserting the privilege in a congressional dispute than any
president in the last three decades.
However House Speaker John Boehner points out that Obamas choice,
implies
that White House officials were either involved in the Fast and Furious
operation or the cover-up that followed.
Executive privilege can be overturned with a court order, however history
shows it is resolved mostly through negotiations .
The HOC has decided to hold Holder in contempt for failing to cooperate with
their congressional inquiry into F&F.
Holder asserted that the HOC action was,
divisive and does nothing to make
any of our law enforcement agents safer.
He maintains that his job is to
protect the American people and this Committee is subverting his efforts
to execute his job properly.
The family of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, who was killed by member of a
Mexican drug cartel with guns that the DoJ provided them through F&F, has
come forth to respond to Obamas use of executive privilege.
Their statement reads that,
President Obamas assertion of executive
privilege serves to compound this tragedy. It denies the Terry family and
the American people the truth.
The Terry family have been requesting for over a year and a half for the US
government to hold those responsible within the government to justice and
accountability.
They recognize that it is very,
disappointing that [the Terry family] are
now faced with an administration that seems more concerned with
protecting themselves rather than revealing the truth behind Operation
Fast and Furious.

"What did the
President know and when did he know it?"
former
senator Howard Baker about Richard Nixon during the
Watergate hearings
20 June 2012
It is interesting that it was exactly forty
years ago this week that five "burglars" were caught inside the Watergate
complex, setting off one of the most notorious presidential scandals in U.S.
history.
The events of June 17, 1972 resulted in the
resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon just over two years later.
During that two years, the press was aggressive in its coverage and
investigation, while the White House denied any involvement with, connection
to, or knowledge of the incident.
During the two years following the arrests of the men caught inside the
Watergate complex and until the White House could no longer suppress
evidence behind the claims of "executive privilege," the press and
congressional investigators were relentless in determining "what Nixon knew
and when he knew it."
How times have changed.
Not very fast, and no fury
Unless you've been trapped in a cave or your television has been stuck on
MSNBC, chances are good that you are aware of a growing scandal known as
Operation Fast & Furious.
Chances are equally good that you don't know all
of the intricate details of Fast & Furious, as it has been the practice of
this administration and many in leadership positions to confuse the public,
convolute the facts, and downplay the murderous scandal that leads directly
to the highest levels of this administration.
