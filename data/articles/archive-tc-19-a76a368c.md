Question:
The best known book about the photon belt was channeled by Sheldan
Nidle, apparently from the Sirian arm of the Galactic Federation.
Was there, at one time, a plan on the part of the Galactic
Federation and/or the Sirians to intervene on Earth when they saw
that we were about to enter the
photon belt?
A:
That was hoped for. ET intervention has been continually delayed due
to the fact that, as I stated earlier, there is not a wish to have
armed intervention. There is a wish to have peaceful intervention.
And until such time as the ships can come without being destroyed or
without engaging in a firefight, this has been delayed for safety
reasons.
If they came today the governments would fire nuclear
weapons on them and not only would those ships risk being destroyed
but much life on this planet would be destroyed as well. There is
much fear in the ruling bodies because they know this would be the
end of their rule, and they would rather burn the Earth than give up
control.
Question:
Please give us some information on
the Galactic Federation.
A:
The Galactic Federation is a body of many ETs, the leaders of which
are ninth dimensional beings, but they encompass beings from the
ninth through the fifth dimension. And their mission has been to
work towards liberating the Earth from the dark forces. They have
worked towards this for many centuries, setting things in place,
infiltrating when they can in small areas.
Question:
How is the
Ashtar Command related to the Galactic Federation?
A:
The Ashtar Command is a wing of the Federation.
Question:
One that more closely concerns Earth?
A:
Yes.
Question:
You stated earlier that the negative ETs, such as the Greys and the
Dracos, are races created by fallen Creator Gods. We know that the
Greys in particular have been responsible for millions of abductions
of humans who were used in their genetics programs. What is the
current status of the negative ETs? Have most of them been
captured?
A:
Yes, I would say upwards of 80% of them have been captured. It has
not been formulated what would be done with them, so they are being
held in an area. Work is being done, negotiations are being made and
some experiments are being done on whether it is possible to uplift
their vibration to where they are able to be integrated into the
rest of the fallen sector as it returns to light.
Question:
They do have souls, do they not?
A:
Yes.
Question:
Couldnt those souls be worked with, and then incarnated into human
type bodies?
A:
It is believed something of that nature will happen, yes.
Question:
Regarding the capture of the negative ETs: Does this mean that
people who have suffered from abductions, including repeated
abductions, will now be free from this?
A:
The abductions are diminished quite significantly in the last year.
Question:
And will ultimately stop?
A:
Yes.
Question:
I have heard a good deal about the
underground bases on Earth, such
as those in the vicinity of Dulce, New Mexico. It is believed that
these bases are staffed by beings such as the Greys, Dracos, and
other negative ETs, and run by them in conjunction with
the
Illuminati.
There are people who have gone into these bases and
lived to telland they have seen these ETs present in dense
physical form. What is the status of the underground bases at the
present time?
A:
They are still intact; the ETs that are there have not been
captured. Of those who have left there to travel outside the earths
atmosphere, many of them have been captured. So they are in a hunker
down mode, trying to stay sheltered from the light beings.
Also one
thing that has happened is the communication and flow of supplies
and so on to the bases has been cut off. The beings there are
isolated and in a state of fear and panicthey know that their days
are numbered.
Question:
Is it correct that there was a major attempt on the part of the
Dracos and others to capture Earth in the fall of 1997?
A:
Yes, it is true.
Question:
That completes our questions for today, Heru. Thank you for this
information.
A:
My love and my blessings to all of you.
