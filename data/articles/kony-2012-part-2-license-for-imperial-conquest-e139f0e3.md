The sequel to the mega-viral disaster that was
Kony 2012 may only be 20
minutes long, but financier-turned-'humanitarian' Ben Keesey still manages to
gravely insult the intelligence of an audience clearly more awake and aware
than he and the corporate-financiers behind Invisible Children would like to
admit.
Surely though, they are more than aware of the
real revolution they've scratched the surface of - a population no longer
swayed by slick marketing campaigns and who are more than ready to confront
such deception.
That is why Invisible Children has not only disabled
comments on their latest piece of propaganda, but have also disabled the
rating system for their video.
Image: Kony 2012: Part II (video can be found here). Ratings and comments
have been disabled exposing "activism 2.0" as the one-way predetermined,
monolithic, corporate-funded agenda it was all along.
Just like traditional corporate propaganda, Invisible Children has become a
one-way marketing operation - while posing as an "activism 2.0" exercise, it
denies activists any opportunity to express their views, influence the
debate, or sway the agenda in any shape form or way - much like Soros-funded
infiltrators did to the Occupy Wall Street movement right before it petered
out.
You are given the illusion of being a part of something bigger than
yourself when in reality you are simply being used by a monolithic
unilateral predetermined agenda.
Bigger than Kony -
Selling the R2P Pretext
Keesey, in his pro-imperial infomercial, begins by citing a 2005 UN World
Summit "outcome" titled "the responsibility to protect" which is drafted
verbatim from a 2001 report titled, "The Responsibility to Protect"
(R2P),
published by the ad hoc International Commission on Intervention and State
Sovereignty (ICISS).
The commission consisted of members drawn from the
Fortune 500-Soros funded International Crisis Group (Fidel Ramos, Cyril Ramaphosa), the Lowy Institute, the
Council on Foreign Relations, and
members of both Western governments and their armed forces. It is a doctrine
created exclusively for the benefit of justifying wars of opportunity,
profit, and conquest by former colonial rulers to recommence the golden age
of global subjugation and plundering.
Already
R2P has been horribly abused in Libya, where violence was
purposefully triggered by the very nations behind the R2P doctrine, then
insidiously used as a pretext to militarily intervene.
Their intervention
saw weapons, money, air support, and diplomatic legitimacy granted to
vicious, racist, genocidal terrorists, notorious for decades of violence not
only in Libya, but in Afghanistan and Iraq.
NATO's assistance to these
terrorists, falling under the banner of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG),
has not only plunged Libya into perpetual chaos, but has seen these rearmed,
reinvigorate terrorists carry their campaign as far east as Syria and as far
west as Mali.
Ironically, Keesey in his "Kony 2012 Part II" video implicates Syria as
another prime candidate for R2P intervention.
It is ironic because Syria is
another nation ravaged by violence openly fueled by the UN, NATO, and their
junior Arab League partners, with the "Free Syrian Army" itself armed,
funded, and directed by NATO-backed Libyan LIFG commander Abdul Hakim Belhaj
all under the pretext of the R2P agenda.
Luis Moreno-Ocampo of the
illegitimate "International Criminal Court" (ICC)
once again lends his questionable stamp of approval to Invisible Children's
crusade to "catch Joseph Kony."
Ocampo states that it is a "dream" that we
are a,
"global community protecting each other."
Ocampo is famous not only
for his role in lying to the world to justify the Libyan War in the first
place, but for his overt deceit during the height of NATO's Libyan campaign
when he claimed Saif al-Islam Qaddafi's capture in Tripoli was not only
"confirmed," but that his transfer to the Hague was underway.
The next day, Saif al-Islam appeared in Tripoli still leading efforts to liberate his
besieged nation.
It would be months before he was actually captured.

after ICC's Luis Moreno-Ocampo "confirmed" he was captured - an overt lie.
Ocampo would compound this lie
by later denying he made any such
confirmation.
Keesey then claims that the world is still standing behind the goals of
Invisible Children, but what his video shows instead is the same steady
stream of deceitful politicians who have held the will of their constituents
in contempt for decades, green-lighting a massive military build-up in
Central Africa for an admittedly meager, "alleged" force of 250 men.
Keesey
produces a smattering of Congolese witnesses that are supposed to sway us -
after their previous film falsely depicted the conflict taking place in
Uganda with a similar smattering of Ugandan witnesses.

Soros-funded Human Rights Watch "Joseph Kony -

Invisible Children's Kony 2012: Part II.
Another bizarre happenstance, as an
identical man, wearing an identical shirt appears in both videos - as if the
editing for both organizations took place in the same office using the same
footage.
The punchline of the sequel comes 13 minutes in, where it is stated that the
ICC has indicted Kony, but lacks an "army" to bring him to justice. The
"solution" of course, requires a joint military force.
John Prendergast of
the Soros-funded "Enough Project" chimes in claiming that Kony's alleged 250
men represent a threat to,
"international peace and security" and requires
"collective responsibility."
The "Enough Project" comes to us from the
Center for American Progress run by notorious corporate lobbyist John Podesta, funded by
George Soros, tied directly to the US State Department,
and yet another special-interest think-tank (covered in more detail in, "JP
Morgan, Exxon, Boeing, Among State Department's New Advisers").
Kony 2012 - R2P's
Public Roll-Out
Keesey saves the best for last, claiming,
"we will not dismiss the problems of our
friends simply because they are not our own - we don't live like that
anymore. And this is only the beginning because stopping injustice
around the world is far bigger than stopping the LRA.
We are a new
generation of justice made for such a time as this. Because our liberty
is bound together across the world and across the street."
And indeed it is bigger than stopping the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) - Kony 2012 and the mission of Invisible Children is
the public roll-out of a geopolitical mechanism long festering amongst the
pages of Fortune 500 think-tanks and being rubber-stamped at the UN for now
over a decade.
It is the public roll-out of R2P - the
"responsibility to protect."
It is the institutionalization of wars of
conquest - a systematic methodology of sowing chaos within any given nation
refusing to pay into the globalist collective and using the resulting
violence, real or imagined, as an excuse to eviscerate their government,
bury their institutions, and build upon the rubble homogeneous networks that
will interlock with globalist "international institutions."
Kony 2012 from A-Z has been revealed as an absolute fraud - a fabrication as
dishonest about the current problems in East and Central Africa as it is
about the alleged solutions.
In reality, the greatest danger to the people of Africa are men like Ugandan
"president-for-life" Yoweri Museveni who is in reality still carrying out
the very atrocities Kony is accused of.
And while
the United
Nations, ICC, and a
menagerie of other "international institutions" pose as an army of "white
knights," they have been instrumental in legitimizing, covering up,
facilitating, and clearly benefiting from the atrocities of men like Museveni.
Just last year, it was reported that Museveni and a British
corporation called "New Forests Company" forcibly evicted
20,000 Ugandans,
incinerating their homes, burning alive and gunning down all who refused to
leave.
The evictions were part of a United Nations "clean air" program and involves
investors including
the World Bank and HSBC.
Image: Taken from New Forests' website, they proudly display the swath of
destruction their company is responsible for, of course, instead of
depicting the displacements, murders, and thuggery they are committing
against the people of Africa, they place images of thriving trees. In just
this manner R2P is being declared as a revolutionary humanitarian
achievement where tales of "democracy" and "freedom" cover up the trail of
atrocities truly being blazed.
If what is essentially criminal land grabbing in Africa can be
institutionalized and dressed up as "protecting the environment," then
dressing up imperial military conquest as "protecting civilians" under the
R2P doctrine is an obvious logical progression.
The R2P doctrine is as big a
fraud as the continuous lies being told to justify it and endear it to the
public - Kony 2012 being perhaps the most obvious embodiment of these lies.

Corbett's "R2P or: How the Left Learned to Stop Worrying and Embrace Wars of
Imperial Aggression":
