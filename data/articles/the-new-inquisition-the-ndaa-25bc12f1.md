No one expects the American Inquisition (apologies to Monty Python).
The Holly Inquisition was said to be the
worst time in the history of humanity, culminating in the Dark Ages, a time
when man's forward evolution was stifled by fear.
When all is said and done, it may be viewed as a cakewalk compared to
today. There are striking similarities between that era of ignorance, pain
and bloodshed (and cause for hiding one's true beliefs), and now.
During the Holly Inquisition, anyone who did not accept the authority of
Pope Gregory IX was labeled a heretic and tortured until they renounced
their own beliefs, or died.
This was legitimized under a Papal Bull given to
Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain.
Today,
the NDAA gives the same authority to
various agencies of the United States government, against those who believe
that they still live in a free country.
During the Holly Inquisition, priests were given higher office (promotions)
based on the number of heretics they could flush out of the general
population. They stood in the square, looking for anyone they could call
suspicious.
They were helped by common citizens - perhaps a
neighbor with whom you were having a dispute over the boundary lines of your
land, or an envious woman who wanted to marry your husband when you were
dead.
Today we have
-
the TSA jealously guarding their
jobs by harassing and physically molesting the public as they are on
their way to Grandma's or their next business meeting
-
the agent hoping that he or she will get
a gold star by finding a terrorist within the long lines they
have created at the airport
-
and they are helped by zealots who say
something when they think the see something - even when all they
see is a grandfather buying a book for his grandchild or having a
heated discussion on their cellphone
During the Holly Inquisition, heretics were
labeled as sick of the mind for not following the church's doctrines and the
torture they suffered was for their own good.
Today, every human emotion, every opinion that
does not match those of the government, is labeled as a mental illness (See
DSM 5), to be cured with mind-numbing drugs or imprisonment in a
mental-health institution where they can be cured of their malady and
join normal society.
Although the Church had a strict policy of not shedding someone's blood, it
was apparently perfectly all right to torture them beyond endurance to help
them get into Heaven. After a while, the admonition against bloodshed was
put aside as well.
Today, local police departments are being
trained to control the public in anticipation of martial law being
instituted in the near future.
One of the tenets protected by the Inquisition was that nothing should be
discussed that was not approved by
the
Church, vis รก vis, that the world might be round, or that the
Earth might not be the center of the Universe (Copernicus and
Galileo suffered for their ideas on this.)
Today,
-
if one - even a noted scientist - denies
global warming is caused by the cars of a thoughtless middle class
-
or if
one propounds that
a falling tower cannot collapse at faster than free-fall
speed by itself
-
or that
genetically modified food is detrimental to the
human body,
...you are labeled as a conspiracy theorist - the modern version
of a heretic.
And the consequences are just as dire, although
more insidious. You can be put on a no-fly list, or even a no-work list,
and with the passage of the NDAA (the modern Papal Bull) you can be held
indefinitely without legal representation, and even tortured for your
opinions and beliefs.
Torquemada would be proud...
Gutenberg could print only Bibles, lest he be arrested for the high crime of
educating the masses by printing a scientific volume. Today the
mainstream
media disseminate only that information that has been approved - or supplied
- by the government agencies who place their own spin on the hot topics of
the day, which include large portions of sports and entertainment news.
One of the main reasons - although not commonly known - for
the Holly Inquisition was that the esoteric knowledge of the Mystery Schools of religion
was coming once again to the surface.
This re-emergence threatened the powers that
were at the time, i.e., the Church's stranglehold on most of the
population.
After all, if
the Church wasn't the only path to
enlightenment and Heaven,
-
Why would the people follow their
strict, oppressive doctrines?
-
Why would they obey the church's orders
to work as slaves for the king who, in turn, gave his riches to the
church?
Today, TPTB (The
Powers That Be) want desperately to cause you to forget that we
are all connected, that we are all part of the one universal energy.
WE are the ones who are powerful. WE are the
ones who can best take care of ourselves. WE are the ones who can determine
what form our life should take, and direct our own path to enlightenment.
The knowledge that we are connected to and part of the one universal
consciousness and can affect the direction in which the world goes by virtue
of our intentions and actions, and that caring about each other (love) can
overcome greed (fear) is something TPTB would dearly like to suppress.
Don't allow the American - or Global -
Inquisition to claim you as a victim, nor an inquisitor. Don't give your
mind, or your beliefs, over to those who want to control you.
If this new Inquisition has replaced your opinion with a governmental spin
line, it has done its job. If you live in fear of saying the wrong thing and
that it might be traced from an email or phone conversation, it has done its
job.
If you rationalize to yourself that the
decimation of free speech, free thought and a free life that does no harm to
others is just the way things are today and that's all right because it
keeps you safe from some unseen enemy, it has done its job.
Just as in the time of the Holly Inquisition, our evolution is being stifled
by fear.
Don't allow a return of the Dark Ages. It is up
to you to make the present and future an age of light.
