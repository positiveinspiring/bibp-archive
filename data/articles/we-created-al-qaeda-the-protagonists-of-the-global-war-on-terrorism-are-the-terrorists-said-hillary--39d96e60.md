The following video features
Hillary Clinton candidly acknowledging that
America created and funded Al Qaeda as a terrorist organization in the
heyday of the Soviet-Afghan war.
What she does not mention is that at no time in the course of the last 30
years has the US ceased to support and finance Al Qaeda as a means to
destabilizing sovereign countries.
The Global War on Terror (GWOT) is led by the United States. It is not
directed against Al Qaeda.
Quite the opposite:
-
The "Global War on Terrorism" uses Al Qaeda terrorist
operatives as their foot soldiers.
-
"Political Islam" and the imposition of an
"Islamic State" (modeled on Qatar
or Saudi Arabia) is an integral part of US foreign policy.
-
America is the Terror State.
-
The GWOT is a diabolical instrument of Worldwide conquest.
It is a means to destabilizing sovereign countries and imposing "regime
change".
Clintons successor at the State Department, John Kerry is in
direct liaison
with Al Nusra, an Al Qaeda affiliated organization in Syria, integrated by
terrorists and funded by the US and its allies.
In a bitter irony, John Kerry is not only complicit in the killings
committed by Al Nusra, he is also in blatant violation of US anti-terrorist
legislation. If the latter were to be applied to politicians in high office,
John Kerry would be considered as a "Terror Suspect".
New Normal? Al Nusra is on the State Department
blacklist of terrorist
organizations and the US Secretary of State is channeling money and weapons
to Al Nusra.
Support to Al Qaeda operatives in different countries by the US government
is known and documented.
In this upside down World, the Lie prevails:
The Protagonists of the "Global
War on Terrorism" and the "Responsibility to Protect" are the Terrorists.
Its a circular relationship, a vicious circle: Those who lead the
"Global
War on Terrorism" in the name of "Democracy" are those who are supporting
and financing terrorist organizations, which they themselves created.
Cest le monde Ã  lenvers.
- Hillary Clinton -
We created Al Qaeda
