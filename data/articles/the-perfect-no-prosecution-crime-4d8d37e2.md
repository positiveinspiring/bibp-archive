Did you know that in the aftermath of the
Savings and Loan (Thrifts) scandal there were more than a thousand felony
convictions of financial elites?
The cost of the wrongdoing associated with the
rip-off and closure of nearly 800 Thrifts cost taxpayers more than $160
billion. The current sub-prime/mortgage-backed security scandal is 40 times
bigger according to Economics professor William Black.
That means the size
of the crime is $6.4 trillion by my calculation.
Can you guess how many indictments there have
been on financial elites who created this enormous
mortgage crisis mess? Zero, none,
nada, zip.
Yes, not one single prosecution or conviction
has been started of achieved.
That is simply outrageous considering the width and breadth of the many
crimes committed. There was rampant mortgage fraud in the loan application
process according to the FBI as far back as 2004 (see one of
many stories of the
FBI warning of mortgage fraud).
There was real estate document fraud when the
original Promissory Notes and loan documents were lost. The Promissory
Notes were required to create tens of thousands of mortgage-backed
securities (MBS). No note, no security. That is security fraud.
No security means the special IRS tax treatments
for the MBSs were fraudulently obtained. That is IRS tax fraud. Because
there were no documents, the rating agencies fraudulently made up triple A
ratings for the securities. When the whole mess blew up, big banks hired
foreclosure mill law firms to create forged documents.
That phony paperwork was and is being used to
wrongfully remove homeowners from their property. That is foreclosure fraud.
It appears to me the entire mortgage/securitization industry is one giant
criminal enterprise.
And yet, last Wednesday, Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Shaun Donovan said,
We have not found any evidence at this
point of systemic issues in the underlying legal or other documents that
have been reviewed.
What! Well, look a little harder Mr. HUD
Secretary (see complete
Reuters story with Donovans quote.)
Donovan did say the foreclosure fiasco is
shameful, but that is not the same as a criminal prosecution now is it?
Where is U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in all of this? I guess
hes busy planning a lawsuit to stop California from making pot smoking a
misdemeanor.
Holder is probably also very busy with
continuing legal actions against Arizonas immigration law. I guess
trillions of dollars in mortgage and securities fraud is just not enough of
a legal priority for America!
All 50 State Attorneys General are looking into what is now being called Foreclosuregate.
Iowa AG, Tom Miller, is leading the
investigation for the 50 states.
His focus, according to a recent Washington Post
story, is preventable foreclosures,
"ones in which small changes might keep the
homeowners in their home - benefits all parties involved. The borrower
keeps the house. The servicer continues to collect fees, and the
investors receive more income than a foreclosure would bring. The
community has one less deserted home.
Millers office also says,
This is a public policy issue.
(See the
complete Wa Po
story.)
When did State AGs become public policy
negotiators for the banks? Where are the criminal prosecutions? This is a
sham and an outrage perpetrated by state governments. Who are they
protecting? I say its really the banks and investors income stream.
It sure doesnt look like the FBI is going to prosecute any of the rampant
mortgage fraud any time soon, according to Professor Black.
At the end of September on the Dylan Ratigan
Show, he said,
We know that the FBI has formed what it
calls a partnership with the Mortgage Bankers Association. Now, thats a
trade association of the perps, and guess what the trade association
said: Hey were the victims. You know none of the bad stuff happened
because the lenders wanted to engage in this fraud, and the FBI
believed them if you can believe that!
Black is not just some angry academic.
Besides being a Professor of Economics at the
University of Missouri KC, he is also a former bank regulator and an expert
in crimes committed by CEOs. He thinks Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and
Attorney General Eric Holder should be fired so real regulators can get to
work on prosecutions of crime throughout the entire industry.
And get this,
just last week, Black adamantly claimed that major frauds continue, at all
the big banks.
Hear for yourself in the clip below:
William Black, a
professor at the University of Missouri at Kansas City, talks about the U.S.
mortgage crisis.
Black speaks with Lisa
Murphy on Bloomberg Television's "Fast Forward."
(This is an excerpt of
the full interview).
Again, Black said,
80% of the loans were fraudulent.
He also said in this segment (but wasnt
included in the clip) that,
securitized mortgage instruments are all
fraudulent.
That means trillions of dollars in MBSs are
worthless!
Foreclosuregate is a gargantuan financial mess,
and federal and state regulators have not found a single crime in all of
this to prosecute? Clearly, the U.S. government and both political parties
are shielding the perpetrators.
Oh wait! The SEC did fine Angelo Mozilo,
the former head of Countrywide Financial Corp., $67.5 million in penalties
to settle civil fraud and insider-trading charges.
Mozilo ripped-off hundreds of millions of
dollars, and he pays a fine that amounts to a parking ticket for a man of
his wealth? Is that the same as a criminal prosecution? I dont think so!!
(more on the
Mozilo story from The WSJ.)
So, if you are or have been committing document, tax, security, rating or
foreclosure fraud, you dont have a thing to worry about. Keep doing what
youve been doing because you are committing the perfect no prosecution
crime.
According to the financial elites, these crimes
are essential to keep the American economy running smoothly.
