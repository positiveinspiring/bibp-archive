# The Hidden Evil - 17

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/hiddenevil/hiddenevil17.htm

Tactics (Part 1)
It has been said that when you're first targeted, they hit you hard in
multiple directions.
Presumably, this is done so you'll collapse
after experiencing recurrent emotional violence, which is compounded after
you've realized that all normal support structures and avenues of grievance
have been removed. There appears to be multiple levels of intensity of this
program that people can receive. The two main parts of the program are group
stalking and Non-lethal Weapons (NLW). Both are violent attacks. And some
are apparently hit hard with both.
People tend to associate the word harassment with acts of temporary
aggravation or pestering. Therefore, it may not by the proper word to
describe the never-ending acts of covert violence inflicted upon targeted
people, which amounts to torture and murder. Some of the tactics used in
these programs are borderline-subliminal, which is why they are so difficult
to detect, explain, and defend against.
It is my goal to make the unconscious,
conscious. Many of these tactics are a type of mind-control.
Most of these tactics have been used in former Cointelpro operations by the
United States, Russia, and Germany against their civilian population.
The Hidden Evil's genesis is obviously derived
from known tactics such as bogus investigations, surveillance, smear
campaigns, the use of noise, thefts, break-ins, character assassination,
staged accidents, framings, sabotage and vandalism, mail interference,
blacklisting, citizen informant squads for overt surveillance (Gang
Stalking), poisoning and drugging, incarceration into prisons and mental
institutions, and electromagnetic weaponry.
It is a historical fact that the U.S. has officially targeted its civilian
population on multiple occasions. Programs such as MKULTRA and Cointelpro
can't be denied.
"The methods reportedly employed in these
harassment campaigns," explained McKinney, "bear a striking resemblance
to those attributed to the CIA and FBI during Operations MKULTRA,
MHCHAOS, and COINTELPRO."
In Germany these methods were contained in two
programs, Zersetzung and Directive Perceptions.
They were basically German versions of
Cointelpro. Zersetzung was developed to destroy a targeted person's
inner-self. During an interview on the Republic Broadcasting Network, Dr.
Munzert, a German target, drew a parallel between the current program, and
what occurred in East Germany.
He explains,
"In Germany this is called Zersetzung and
this means the dissolution or disintegration of the targeted person."
BBC in 2004 for her non-fiction book, Stasiland.
In it, she wrote,
"The German word Zersetzung is harsh, and
has no direct English equivalent." She described, "Zersetzung, as a
concept, involves the annihilation of the inner-self."
It calls for,
"[The] targeted spreading of rumours about
particular persons with the aid of anonymous [means]... making
compromising situations for them by creating confusion over the facts...
[and] the engendering of hysterical and depressive behaviors in the
target person."
"Directive Perceptions," she continued, was
another program designed to "develop apathy (in the [targeted]
subject)... to achieve a situation in which his conflicts, whether of a
social, personal, career, health or political kind are irreversible...
to give rise to fears in him... to develop/create disappointments... to
restrict his talents or capabilities... to reduce his capacity to act
and... to harness dissentions and contradictions around him..."
These directives were used by the Ministry for
State Security (MfS) against threats to state security. In other words, they
were massively used on the population to maintain a dictatorship.
These programs were designed to secretly destroy a target's personal and
professional life, ruin them financially, and prevent them from reaching
their potential, with the intention to produce irreversible depressive and
panic-stricken behaviors. What the Hidden Evil appears to be, is a
combination of various Cointelpro operations used by oppressive regimes on
their civilian population. It has been refined and deployed globally.
As I'll demonstrate, it is likely an indication
of the creation of a worldwide dictatorship.
Hidden in Plain View
Many of us have experience with books where the goal is to find the hidden
picture contained in the landscape.
Or the artwork, where if you look intently, you
will eventually see a three-dimensional picture superimposed on a flat
background. At first, most of us had some trouble detecting these hidden
pictures, but with practice we usually see them. Once the detection
mechanism is developed, these hidden objects become clearly visible with
little effort. So too with the Hidden Evil.
Once you know what to look for, these
borderline-subliminal attacks are quite detectable.(*)
So, rather than using a blunt overt attack against a fully functional
person, they usually attack covertly, and conceal their harassment by using
existing events that occurs naturally. There is usually cover for the
harassment as well. However, it is probably a statistical rarity for some of
these staged events to occur as often as they do. They conceal much of their
harassment using what appears to be a simple formula.
From what I've learned, the basic formula is as
follows:
-
Frequency: Describes how often an event
occurs. It also pertains to the number of acts within a single
event.
-
Duration: Pertains to the length of a
single event. It also pertains to the non-stop nature of the
harassment in general.
-
Intensity: The amplification of acts
such as sound, sight, crowding, etc. within an event.
A hypothetical example of a car door-slamming
event would include this:
One neighbor arrives and two others leave.
As they're tending to their vehicles there is
the repeated opening and shutting doors and trunks, alarms going off, and
beeping from alarms being turned on. These disturbances emanate from areas
surrounding your house. This may happen simultaneously, or they may be
strung together, one right after the other. Synopsis
The event lasted for 5 minutes; longer than normal (Duration). In addition
to length of the event being extended, the number of times each act occurred
within the event was increased (Frequency).
Ex: Multiple, repeated doors/trunk slamming from
cars, even if a single individual is at the vehicle. This event also happens
many times throughout the day (Frequency). Each individual act of door/trunk
shutting is amplified by deliberate slamming to produce a louder than normal
noise (Intensity).
The event was louder, contained more activity (acts), and lasted longer than
normal to produce a covert attack. Even if a single individual is
arriving/leaving, standard practice seems to be multiple slams (trunk, back
door, driver's door).
This may be synchronized with your activity,
such as your arrival or departure. The event may also be a part of a Noise
Campaign consisting of an alteration of other types of noise. This basic
formula is used with many of the tactics outlined in this chapter. The
frequency and duration formula is also used in Mobbing.
In addition to the overuse of an individual
tactic, these tactics are combined and used in a round-the-clock fashion,
which amplifies their overall potency.
Basic Protocol
There is a basic protocol that they
begin with which is consistent in all NATO nations.
It begins with the surveillance of targets,
monitoring of their private lives, and entry into their homes (break-ins).
This is done so their personality traits can be cataloged.
"There is a basic protocol that the
perpetrators begin with," states McKinney, "but the TI [Targeted
Individual] contributes to the modification."
After they are singled out for preliminary
stages of harassment, Gang Stalking ensues, which McKinney describes as part
of a "softening-up process."
After a period of overt surveillance (Gang
Stalking), NLW are introduced. The NLW harassment gradually increases to
extreme conditions. This pattern has unfolded consistently in all NATO
countries.
Dr. Munzert speaks of basically the same pattern, which he describes as a
"double-folded strategy."
"It is usually the same procedure," he
announced, "but with individual variations."
One part includes the victims being "attacked
with microwave weapons," and "the other part of the strategy" he says, is to
portray the targeted people as "mad [insane]."
He explained the effectiveness of this approach
as "unbeatable," and reveals that this is essentially what the Stasi did to
their targets. Part of this protocol appears to include elements of Neuro-linguistic
Programming (NLP), which is a type of mind-control used by behaviorists to
affect change. NLP will be covered in more detail shortly.
Some of the tactics below have been called Street Theatre, Harassment Skits,
or Staged Events. They are planned harassment skits, such as blocking, or
swarming. They also include informants who surround targets and have
conversations intended to be overheard, which contain information about the
target's personal life.
Presumably, citizen informants are told that
this is necessary to let targeted people know they're being watched. This
may happen in any public place. This is not a complete list of tactics but
it includes some of the more common ones reported.
Some of these tactics will sound insane because they're deliberately
designed to make someone appear as though they're suffering from a mental
disorder. They were definitely created by experts in the behavioral
sciences. In addition, people may be emotionally drained, and unable to
properly identify or explain what's happening to them.
According to the DOJ, mental tactics designed to
cause psychological harm must last for months or years before they
constitute torture. The Hidden Evil fits this description.
So keep in mind, these are Psychological Warfare
tactics which are intended to drive people crazy.
Mental Health System
The mental health system is
apparently being used worldwide to discredit targeted people who complain.
According to the book, Journey Into Madness: The
True Story of Secret CIA Mind Control and Medical Abuse, by Gordon Thomas,
countries around the world, including the U.S., have used doctors to help
abuse and discredit people, often for political reasons. It is also a
documented fact that there was collaboration between doctors and the
military when experiments were carried out in prisons, hospitals, and
universities on unwitting people in North America.
McKinney states that medical doctors, as well as psychiatrist and
psychologists appear to be providing cover for this program.
This is similar to what was done in Russia,
where enemies of the dictatorship would be thrown into mental institutions
and drugged beyond recovery.
"The APA's refusal to acknowledge the impact
of terrorization upon the human psyche, even given the publicity
stemming from the Church Committee's findings in 1975, raises serious
questions about the validity of psychiatry as a profession in this
country," declared McKinney, "not to mention, the APA's ethical intent,
in the long term."
The DSM is a diagnostic manual for identifying
mental disorders.
The first edition of the DSM was released in
1952 at a time when the APA was under the control of Dr. Ewen Cameron, who
would commit brutal government-sponsored torture under the MKULTRA program.
Dr. Rauni Leena Kilde, former Chief Medical Officer of Finland, wrote an
article entitled, Microwave Mind Control: Modern Torture and Control
Mechanisms Eliminating Human Rights and Privacy.
In it she described,
"The Psychiatric Diagnostic Statistical
Manual (DSM) for mental disorders," as a "brilliant cover up operation
in 18 languages to hide the atrocities of military and intelligence
agencies' actions towards their targets."
Dr. Kilde says the manual,
"lists all mind control actions as signs of
paranoid schizophrenia," and that "all medical schools teach their
students that the person is paranoid, ESPECIALLY if he believes
intelligence agencies are behind it all."
Finally she proclaims,
"Never is the medical profession told that
these are routine actions all over the world by intelligence agencies
against their targets."
Dr. Munzert said that doctors,
"first think of paranoia and schizophrenia"
if someone complains of this program.
He cautions that because of this, "victims"
could end up in a "lunatic asylum."
Annie Earle, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker,
and Board Certified Diplomat in her area of expertise, has over 25 years of
psychotherapy experience as an independent practitioner. When referring to
the DSM during an interview on the Republic Broadcasting Network, she
stated,
"It's called the Diagnostic Statistical
Manual... [and all] psychotherapists, regardless of specialty are
required to give their patients a diagnosis from this manual, and in
order to get the diagnosis you have to fulfill certain criteria that is
clearly spelled out in the DSM."
Earle noticed a pattern unfolding when some of
the people who came to her who did not fit the standard criteria.
"The patients that started coming to me
really did not fit any of the standard classifications," she explained.
"For example, they might be having what some
people consider a psychotic or schizophrenic breakdown in that they
might report what seem to be hallucinations, but they did not have any
of the other criteria that goes along with schizophrenia. There are many
criteria that one is required to... [detect] in making the diagnosis of
schizophrenia, and these people did not meet all that criteria."
Apparently Earle became targeted herself while
studying this program.
Interestingly, the April/May 1996 issue of Nexus Magazine contained an
article entitled, How The NSA Harasses Thousands Of Law Abiding Americans
Daily By The Usage Of Remote Neural Monitoring (RNM) written by former NSA
worker John St. Clair Akwei.
It read,
"NSA DOMINT [Domestic Intelligence] has the
ability to covertly assassinate U.S. citizens or run covert
psychological control operations to cause subjects to be diagnosed with
ill mental health."
The DSM appears to have been created with a
loophole which allows government-sponsored harassment programs to exist.
This was evidently done so that people will
appear ill when explaining this to a mental health professional. Adding to
this confusion, the program itself is designed to mimic mental illness when
explained to those "not-in-the-know."
Mental health professionals may also participate
in this program, wittingly or unwittingly by labeling targets as mentally
ill. It is one of several layers of protection used to help keep this
program operating in secrecy.
It's easy to see how some mental health
professionals might "jump to conclusions."
Surveillance
Surveillance is apparently part of an ongoing bogus investigation that never
ends.
The investigation may be done for reasons of
"national security." Similarly, German and Russian security forces would
often target the civilian population for the same reason. After a person is
singled out, dwellings surrounding the target will be sublet and used as
bases of operation and training.
If the target lives in a house, the base will usually be the closest
building to the house. If the target lives in an apartment, then the base
will be in one or more of the surrounding apartments. There will be unusual
patterns of occupancy with lots of people coming and going into these bases.
Vehicles and license plates used by the occupants of the bases may be
periodically changed.
According to McKinney and Moret, the people who
move into these bases have been linked to the DOJ, CIA, and other federal
agencies, as well as Universities, and government defense contractors.
"In order to target someone it requires that
that person be put under surveillance," proclaimed McKinney, "so that
their personality traits, their capacity to inter-relate with people,
their capacity for corruption or non-corruption (that seems to be a
critical point), and even their religion factors into it."
The information obtained by surveillance is used
for no ethical reason,
"other than to establish a harassment
protocol, which will follow that targeted individual for the rest of his
or her life," said McKinney.
Moret said that neighbors, friends and family
are then co-opted into the harassment.
This surveillance is apparently done using very sophisticated equipment
which can locate targeted people through walls. This equipment seems to be
used in combination with Directed Energy Weapons and other "Non-lethals."
According to McKinney, miniature microphones and
cameras may be planted in your home, or through-the-wall infrared devices
may be used to monitor your movement. The Life Assessment Detector System
(LADS) developed at Georgia Tech was apparently created to rescue people
trapped in rubble, avalanches, or other disasters.
It has a range of about 135 feet can and can
detect heartbeat and respiration. It can also be configured to track a
specific person's movement inside a building.
Soldier
Vision A1, a radar flashlight, has a standoff
distance of 30 feet and can detect motion behind a wall at 30 feet as well.
These flashlights have been steadily researched
using military and university testing labs since the 1990s. Some of these
flashlights display images in 3D format, can detect respiration, and can see
through, wood, brick, plasterboard, glass and concrete.
More than likely, the surveillance technology
which is now being used on targets worldwide is much more advanced and not
publicly available.
Character Assassination
Targets usually experience character assassination which is done to destroy
their personal and professional life.
Half-truths and lies are often strategically
spread into their lives, and may be the basis for a bogus investigation. The
rumors circulated about people are apparently not petty, but shocking and
repulsive. They are CIA or Stasi-type life-damaging lies. Some of the people
spreading these lies may be acquaintances and/or family members that have
been recruited (lied to, intimidated and blackmailed) into becoming
informants.
More on the recruitment of family and friends
will be covered in the Informants and Motivational Factors chapters.
U.S. Federal law enforcement has used these tactics to destroy people they
either wanted to recruit as informants or those they knew they couldn't
recruit and just wanted to destroy.
According to former CIA psychologist James
Keehner,
"It was planned destructiveness. First,
you'd check to see if you could destroy a man's marriage. If you could,
then that would be enough to put a lot of stress on that individual, to
break him down. Then you might start a rumor campaign against him.
Harass him constantly."
Constant harassment, planned destructiveness,
character assassination, destroying relationships, all done in concert with
the goal of breaking someone down are a standard part of this program.
Reportedly, the usual rumors spread about a person are that they are a
pedophile, prostitute, terrorist, racist, anti-government, mentally ill,
drug addict, drug dealer, or a threat to "national security." They are often
spread to neighbors, friends, family, employers, etc. A major effort is
spent to separate a person from their friends and families.
Apparently these rumor campaigns aid in recruitment.
Dr. Rauni Kilde wrote,
"Deception is the name of the game, so
recruits are told untrue sinister stories of their victims to keep them
motivated."
According to CNN, the Stasi used the exact same
tactics. They stated,
"The agency was authorized to conduct secret
smear campaigns against anyone it judged to be a threat..."
The Russian KGB too, with its massive network of
informants, would slander their internal targets.
These rumors may be propagated by multiple people (informants) behind a
target's back. Apparently, not letting a targeted person become aware of
these rumors is essential to their effectiveness.
Victor Santoro noted in his book, Gaslighting:
How to Drive Your Enemies Crazy, that,
"The essence of defaming your target with
rumors is it that it not get back to him."
Some targeted people believe that rumors are
being spread that they are pedophiles.
The organizers realize that labeling someone a
pedophile will be highly damaging and produce optimum leverage for gaining
community support. It is probably one of the worst rumors you could launch
against someone. The Stasi would destroy the character of their targets by
labeling them as pedophiles as well.
There have been multiple magazine and newspaper
reports of pedophiles being harassed by neighbors, and vigilante groups to
the point where they are driven out of communities and forced out of work.
Some have been driven out of multiple states.
An article in the Toronto Star entitled, Vigilantes Versus Pedophiles on
August 8, 2004 outlined how one citizen's group called, Perverted-Justice,
would start campaigns to expose people that they have concluded were
potential pedophiles. This illustrates the mind-set of some groups of people
who have reason to believe a person is a pedophile.
The PJ group is run by Xavier Von Erck (real
name Phillip John Eide), at www.perverted-justice.com.
Upon visiting a site called Corrupted-Justice at www.corrupted-justice.com,
I discovered that multiple members of Perverted Justice have endured trauma
such as incest or other forms of sexual abuse and are suffering from a
variety of mental disorders. The Corrupted-Justice site obtained this
information from member profiles which are publicly available, and located
at the Perverted-Justice website.
And according to CJ, Eide is on record saying
that more than 40% of his followers have endured this type of sexual abuse.
The CJ site also has some very interesting message board chats (publicly
available) by PJ members that are worth a look. Apparently the CJ people
have documented proof that members of PJ have hacked into their web server.
The CJ people are for the full prosecution of potential sex offenders by
using law enforcement equipped with the checks and balances built into the
legal system.
The CJ group basically says that although the PJ
system appears to be beneficial, it is heavily corrupted.
Most PJ "busts" do not include law enforcement. According to the article in
the Toronto Star and the CJ website, the volunteers at PJ instead begin a
relentless campaign to expose people they believe are pedophiles by calling
friends, neighbors, children, places of employment and ruining personal and
professional relationships.
This is similar to what targeted people
experience, as indicated by the behavior of their friends, family and
co-workers. But they're never told about it. PJ is listed as a potential
destructive cult by the Rick A. Ross Institute for the Study of Destructive
Cults, www.Rickross.com.
It appears that some PJ members have a psychological need to feel powerful
and meet that need by displaying to the public and their targets how they
can destroy a life. I believe that some of these volunteers are ill and have
latent sadistic intentions, despite their patriotic motives. Apparently some
of them receive a sick type of enjoyment/empowerment by ruining the lives of
people, as evident by their chats.
Character assassination is standard. My research leads me to conclude that
it is not beyond these people to masquerade as "concerned citizens" and call
local officials to register destructive complaints about a targeted person.
I'm fairly certain they do this.
This type of "community service" can be very
damaging, especially when the complaints originate from multiple, seemingly
unconnected sources.
Sensitivity Programs (NLP)
Some of the sensitivity tactics used by
these groups are borderline-subliminal attacks designed to artificially
create phobias.
They are apparently based on Neuro-Linguistic
Programming (NLP). You can think of NLP as a very powerful tool that can be
used to produce rapid, profound change. The parts of NLP that groups use are
anchors and triggers.
The goal of a these sensitivity programs appears to be to condition people
with damaging emotions which are linked to triggers such as objects, colors,
movements, and sounds. Once this is done, a target can be covertly injured
openly in public. This may happen with or without the target's conscious
awareness.
As I'll demonstrate, this is brutally violent.
"There is a basic protocol that the
perpetrators begin with, but the TI contributes to the modification,"
explained McKinney.
She described that a "pavalonian conditioning"
program, is used to get targeted people to "respond emotionally to a
particular trigger."
These negative emotions are then "built into the
protocol."
"It's an ongoing process," declared
McKinney. Moret agrees saying, "They will stalk the target for a
while... to condition them," and make them "confused and frightened."
Self-help gurus use these programs to create
positive emotional states and anchor them to a movement, a sound or an
object.
Then the sound, movement, or object becomes the
trigger that will invoke the emotion. Although this sounds complex it is
pretty simple in practice. It is done by creating a peak emotional state,
and then while in that state, you anchor it, that is, do something
repeatedly.
This effectively anchors the emotional state to
whatever was repeatedly done.
"A stimulus which is linked to and triggers
a physiological state is called an anchor in NLP," stated O'Connor and
Seymour in their book, Introducing NLP.
They ask,
"How are anchors created?"
"First by repetition... Secondly, and much
more important, anchors can be set in a single instance if the emotion
is strong and the timing is right."
This process of creating anchors has also been
called Emotional Transference.
We're unconsciously creating anchors in our environment all the time with
people, music, places, and objects. These stalking groups are obviously led
by people knowledgeable in the behavioral sciences. The groups are used to
create negative emotional states in targeted people, such as fear and
anxiety, and anchor them to common objects.
This is the deliberate creation of a phobia!
O'Connor and Seymour declare,
"An external stimulus can trigger a very
powerful negative state."
"This is the realm of phobias," they warn.
This is nothing less than using violence to
create an injury and then deliberately irritating it.
"Targets are constantly monitored and if a
target responds emotionally to a particular trigger, that will be built
into the protocol," says McKinney.
Organizations known to have studied NLP include
military intelligence agencies, CIA, FBI, and other state bureaus of
investigation.
According to an article called, Non-Lethality,
which appeared in June 1993 issue of Lobster Magazine, in the early 1980s,
Dr. John Alexander taught NLP to "selected general officers and Senior
Executive Service members" as a "set of techniques to modify behavior
patterns."
Some of the references used in this article were
taken from Dr. Alexander's book, The Warrior's Edge, which was co-authored
by Janet Morris, who, according to the article, was a student of the Silva
course in advanced mind-control. In the Structure chapter, I'll provide
evidence that Dr. Alexander and Janet Morris have contributed to the
creation of this program on behalf of the Think Tanks, as part of a
political agenda.
In their book, Dr. Alexander and Janet Morris wrote,
"In 1983, the NLP training group, along with
John Alexander, was engaged to teach these skills to several members of
Congress, including Al Gore and Tom Downey, under the auspices of
Congressmen Clearing House on the Future, a bipartisan activity
established to provide information to congressmen when they request it."
He continued,
"One organization that played a major role
in the dissemination of NLP skills was the U.S. Army Intelligence and
Security Command (INSCOM)... Unlike the rest of the U.S. Army, INSCOM
does not differentiate between wartime and peacetime roles."
According to his Bio, available at
www.platinumstudios.com, Dr. Alexander has worked at,
"the highest levels of government," such as
"the White House Staff, National Security Council, Members of Congress,
Director of Central Intelligence, and senior defense officials."
Morris' Bio, available at www.m2tech.us, is
similar. Some of the organizations she's worked with include: the White
House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Office of the Secretary of
Defense, the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, etc.
"Anchoring," stated Morris and Alexander,
"is based on the neurophysiological assumption that patterns of behavior
can be installed, then reactivated whenever a similar situation is
encountered or created... Knowing this, you can intentionally install
anchors to return your target to specific emotional states. The first
step is [to] create the desired emotional state in the individual."
There has been some concern in the mental health
field over the potential misuse of NLP.
Unfortunately, like other tools, such as guns,
they can be misused in the wrong hands. Andreas and Faulkner warned of the
"possible uses and misuses of this technology," in their book, NLP: The New
Technology of Achievement.
They wrote,
"We recognize the incredible power," of NLP
and "recommend you exercise caution..."
The deliberate infliction of emotional pain is
an act of violence. The use of NLP in this manner is similar to a physical
attack such as a punch or kick, only it leaves no visible injury.
Here's an example of how groups use NLP to make you aware that you're being
stalked:
One morning you're walking out to your car
and a man walks in front of you, stares directly at you in a hostile
manner while repeatedly clicking his pen the whole time. You feel a
little uneasy and say to yourself, "Boy that was weird, what was his
problem?"
Then two hours later you're leaving a shopping mall on a day that it was
not particularly crowded. As you walk out to your car, an old lady
approaches you on foot. As she almost collides with you, she locks her
eyes onto you with a hostile demeanor, while clicking a pen the whole
time. Then maybe you tell yourself something like this. "There couldn't
be a relation between those events, probably just a coincidence. But
they both stared at me in such a mean way while hammering their pens..."
Later in the afternoon, you're on your way home. You're at a stoplight
and out of the corner of your eye you see a passenger in the car to your
left. You hear a slight noise, and glance over. You see a man glaring at
you with a grin on his face. His arm is hanging out the window and he is
holding a pen, which he is repeatedly clicking. Now imagine that
happening for a month. Then a few days later you're on a sidewalk with a
friend or family member. A man walks by, doesn't look at either one of
you, but clicks his pen a couple of times. You feel anxious and afraid.
You may not even know you've been sensitized.
One reason people may not realize that they're
targeted or can't remember exactly when it began, is because these groups
may slowly and gradually increase the harassment over time. But if you did
recognize it as an attack, what would you tell your friend or family member?
This is what happened:
The collisions, blatant hostile staring, and
foul grin created the negative emotions and anchored them to the pen,
which has now become the trigger.
That is an example of a sensitivity program. Now
imagine yourself being sensitized to multiple objects and sounds, and each
of them creating pain each time you see or hear them.
Targets around the world have witnessed this being done with sounds,
gestures, cell phones, laptops, pens, cars, watches, clothing, symbols,
colors, and other items. This type of attack does require some maintenance
and will loose its potency unless it is reinforced. So groups will reinforce
these anchors and triggers with an occasional blitz attack from time to
time.
The example above is a simple tactic which groups can use to let you know
that you're being harassed in public. But there are many other attacks which
NLP can be used for. For instance, you have recently experienced an
extremely traumatizing event (which may have been facilitated by a faction
of this network), such as an accident, death of a family member or pet, or
some type of a brutal assault.
Those who have you under surveillance know that
there is a color, object, or sound that you've linked (anchored) massive
pain to. Then shortly afterward, you are stalked by multiple people who
carry that object, wear that color, or utter that phrase. This brings to the
surface all the emotional pain you suffered during that experience.
Imagine this happening again and again, every
time you go outside. Now think what it would be like if your family and
friends started to participate.
Groups will take an object you've been sensitized to and link it to another
object. The idea appears to be to keep expanding the amount of objects you
associate fear, anxiety, anger, or shame with. For instance, one of your
neighbors has made it clear that they're participating in the harassment.
Now, you know they're participating, and they know you know.
So they may try to sensitize you to another
stimulus such as a car alarm.
Because you've already associated them with massive pain, they can extend
their harassment to a sound by turning their car alarm on/off in rapid
succession over a short period of time, multiple times throughout the day.
After they've done this for a couple of days and you've been sensitized to
this sound, they can reduce their use of this specific tactic and just use
the occasional maintenance sounds to inflict pain.
Now instead of repeatedly turning it on/off ten times, they only do it two
or three times in a row, just to let you know you're being attacked. Even
though it's only done a couple times in a row, you know why they're doing it
and you may feel anger, fear, anxiety or other negative emotions. You may
also feel frustrated at the prospect of trying to explain this harassment to
another individual.
Anyone else observing this might think it's a little strange that someone
would turn their alarm on/off a few times but they'd probably write it off
as an isolated strange incident. But because they have not had your
experience with that sound, and are not aware that it is a small part of a
much larger harassment program, it would be difficult to explain that those
beeps were attacks.
In NLP, the process of copying an emotional state from an existing trigger
to a new trigger is called chaining.
O'Connor and Seymour state,
"Anchors can be chained so that one leads to
another. Each anchor provides a link on the chain and triggers the next
one, just as the electrical impulse flows from nerve to nerve in our
body."
After a person has been sensitized to a color or
object, the article can become a unification symbol for the group, much like
a uniform.
For instance, after a person has been sensitized
to the color red, she is surrounded by people wearing red cloths in public.
Furthermore, this is an adaptable uniform because it can be changed in less
than five minutes. If a person who realizes that they're being Gang Stalked
has been sensitized to red, then the organizers of these groups can simply
have them blitzed by a horde of citizens wearing the color blue.
The harassment has now been chained to this
color. Most likely, these uniforms also help promote group cohesiveness, and
may foster feelings of empowerment among stalkers.
Space Invasion (Crowding)
Space invasion includes blocking,
cut-offs, and swarming or what some TIs refer to as, crowding.
Targets may be encircled by people wearing
colors or holding objects that they've been sensitized to. Prolonged
crowding can have an extremely negative effect on your mental/emotional
health. The people who designed this harassment program were obviously well
aware of this.
While some cultures may be more immune to
crowding than others, even people from parts of the world that have been
historically crowded react stressfully to crowding. People who have not been
invited into your personal space but deliberately violate it are attacking
you.
Body language is more accurate and reliable than verbal communication. Most
of this non-verbal communication is unconscious. The study of this language
has been called Social Kinesics (the study of body communication). There are
two components to this communication: One contains movements, gestures,
postures, the other is spatial relationships. The study of communication
using distance/space is called Proxemics.
For most North Americans the intimate zone is 0-18 inches and personal space
is 1 -4 feet. This type of communication is used to harass a person. For
instance, while in stores, restaurants and public places that are not busy,
a target will have people invading their personal space. This happens even
if there are only two customers in a store.
If a targeted person makes a move from one place
to another, several people may suddenly appear and jump out in front of him
from around corners and isles.
The deliberate space invasion use by these people is designed to look like
normal cut-offs and collisions that we all experience from time to time. It
can happen with vehicles, on foot, or a combination.
This type of space invasion is obviously
intended to startle people and make them tense. It can be thought of as a
virtual slap. They are used in blind areas such as corners, hallways,
restrooms, or intersections where targets have people or cars cutting them
off, or almost hitting them in a calculated manner.
This happens in stores, buildings and on the
street, with people and vehicles.
With some artificially induced cut-offs, the perpetrator is seen at a
distance. The target and the perpetrator(s) are heading toward the same
focal point which is used to maximize crowding. The point may be a corner, a
very small walkway, a thin passageway, or an obstruction on the sidewalk
such as a telephone pole or a tree.
The informants adjust their timing so that they
meet the target at the exact point where there is the least amount of space
for all parties to pass, thus maximizing the invasion of the target's space.
Apparently the idea is to get the target's
attention and make them uncomfortable. When standing in a checkout-line,
targets may routinely have group members standing a foot or closer behind
them. And rather than wait for a target to leave, they may crowd them as
they reach to the side or in front of the target to put their items on the
counter.
If a target is outdoors in a populated area, he or she may see a wave of
people move in the direction that they're headed in order to swarm them.
If a target moves, then stops and waits for a
few moments, they may see that the activity will settle back to normal again
after the horde passes. This test can be run indoors and outdoors as well.
Sometimes the horde may blatantly adjust their timing, or linger for a while
until the target begins to move again, then they'll continue.
These crowding and blocking tactics amount to an
obstacle course that follows people wherever they go.(**)
They will also block targets, both on foot and with vehicles. For instance,
as a target leaves a parking lot, a vehicle or person will be in the way,
usually for a few moments. These things happen to everyone, once in a while,
but for targets, it happens consistently, regardless of the time of day or
how busy the area is.
This space invasion happens on days/times that there are normally not many
people. It happens in stores while making purchases, restaurants,
businesses, where targets have people frequently cutting them off, invading
their space, using sensitivity programs, or other harassment tactics. If
there is one customer in the store, they will probably be invading the
target's space.
For instance, a TI is indoors when it is not
crowded, but witnesses multiple people who, instead of taking the shortest
path to their destination, go double or triple the distance just so they can
brush by them or cut them off.
Here is one personal example which took place at a YMCA in Boston, shortly
after I realized I was being Gang Stalked. At the time, there were four
people, including myself in the weight room. After I was there for a few
moments I noticed there was an unusual amount weight banging. It was louder
and more repetitive that it normally is.
I've been exercising and going to health clubs for about 15 years and I
immediately recognized that these few people were repeatedly going out of
their way to make as much noise as possible. I sat down on a bench and
started doing dumbbell presses. Two students walked in, stood on either side
of the bench I was sitting on and began to do lateral arm raises, blatantly
invading my personal space.
There was no special equipment that they were
using in that area. I noticed one had a shirt on that said something like,
"The MOST important part of playing rugby is
support."
Anyone who can't wait a few minutes for you to
finish and needs to stick their arms in your face is probably doing it on
purpose.
In addition, the exercise they were doing could
have been done anywhere else a gym that was almost empty. It was a dead
giveaway. Another student arrived and began lingering in an area to my left.
He stared at me for a few seconds and started smirking.
Once he had my attention he turned his back to me so I could see his shirt
which read, "CHASE." In smaller letters underneath was the word,
"Manhattan." These attacks using symbolism are common reports among people
who are targeted. The kid with the CHASE shirt left shortly after, and his
total stay was about ten minutes.
That episode is an example of noise, crowding,
and symbolic attacks.
Noise Campaigns
All targets of the Hidden Evil are
familiar with noise campaigns.
Basically, targets report experiencing a steady
stream of noise consisting of a rotation of various types of disturbances
around their homes. This includes door slamming, yelling, car alarms, horns,
tires screeching, loud music, engines revving, and frequent construction
projects which include an assortment of noise from heavy machinery and
tools.
Not surprisingly, in his books Future War and
Winning the War, Dr. Alexander described using noise as a weapon.
In Future War he wrote,
"Audible sound, in frequencies from 20 to
20,000 hertz, can be applied to influence behavior, as most people are
sensitive to very loud noises."(***)
For instance, if you're targeted, there will be
doors slamming for a few moments, several minutes of silence will ensue,
then a motorcycle will drive by and rev its engine outside of your house.
After that you'll have someone mowing the lawn.
Then there will be alarms going off. After that you'll hear a loud crowd of
people walk by your house. Then you may then hear fire or ambulance sirens.
Then there will be hammering and sawing sounds from the ongoing construction
projects. Then you'll hear car alarms being turned on/off in succession
multiple times from multiple vehicles around your house.
There will generally not be a solid five minutes
of uninterrupted peace.
Moret spoke of the use of "noise campaigns" which included the frequent use
of garbage disposals in surrounding apartments, vehicles with "blaring
horns" and the sirens of fire trucks.
She also spoke of habitual door slamming,
proclaiming,
"they'll slam doors all day and all night
long." "Door slamming," agreed McKinney, "is also a popular pastime,
particularly in apartment settings."
Those targeted may experience a "chain reaction"
of door slamming by apartments or houses surrounding theirs.
Other types of disturbances include frequent
noise from lawn mowers, snow blowers, vehicles with loud exhaust systems,
and ambulance sirens, etc. Noisy construction projects will usually be
ongoing.
"Blaring horns, sirens, [and] garbage
disposal[s]" which are "run concurrently in apartment settings, for
excessively prolonged periods of time," are common reports wrote
McKinney.
She also noted that targets experience frequent,
"amplified transmissions" of "general
racket" which is "used on a recurrent basis under circumstances intended
to persuade the individual that he or she is under surveillance."
She added,
"In all of these cases, the individuals'
neighbors apparently pretend to be oblivious and/or indifferent to these
sudden, continuous explosions of noise."
They're oblivious to the noise because they're
complicit in the program.
Also, the people above a targeted individual may loudly pace as they mimic
his or her movements from above. For instance, if you're targeted, as you
walk into your bathroom, you hear loud stomping from above which follows you
into the bathroom.
McKinney affirmed,
"A number of individuals report that
occupants of upstairs and downstairs apartments appear to follow them
from room to room, tapping on the floor or engaging in other activities
which appear intended to advertise an ongoing surveillance."
They'll "pace in their apartment," added Moret,
and seemingly to the target underneath them,
"it sounds like they're being tracked...
from the apartment above."
If you're targeted, helicopters and small
propeller planes may frequently pass over your home.
Some of these aircrafts may be low enough to
vibrate the room you're in. According to Cheryl Welsh's March, 2003 article
entitled, List of Mind Control Symptoms, the use of helicopters is a common
tactic reported by targets. Apparently these overhead assaults are used for
sleep disruption and to undermine the morale of targeted people.
Welsh is one of only six Non-lethal Weapons experts in the world recognized
by the United Nations. This noise may follow you to destinations you
frequently visit. Foot and vehicular traffic may be re-routed through your
street, causing an unnatural amount of vehicles driving by your house (even
if you're on a side or dead-end street).
There also appears to be a fleet of vehicles
equipped with loud mufflers that groups use specifically for creating noise
in the targeted area.
Often, noise will be synchronized with some type of activity. For instance,
a target hears an ambulance, fire sirens, alarms, or beeps as they leave. Or
as they leave, a small aircraft passes overhead, then as they approach their
car, they hear alarms or doors slamming.
Noises made as they leave also appear to serve
as a form of communication to alert group members in the area to begin
pursuit. In addition to the standard noise package, whatever noise would
naturally occur in the area you live will also be increased in frequency.
For instance, if a target lives in a rural area then noisy chainsaws will be
quite regular.
And in the winter there may be frequent loud
snowmobiles that pass near the area.
In this manner, noise is used as a weapon to inflict pain. Chronic exposure
to even low-level noise is considered a health hazard that has been known to
produce adverse physiological & psychological health effects. Prolonged
exposure to noise can produce high blood pressure, a rise in cholesterol,
damage to the circulatory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, &
musculoskeletal systems.
If you're targeted & pregnant or plan on having
a baby, you may want to think twice. Noise has been known to cause hearing
loss & growth disturbances in a fetus, & can lead to birth defects.
Prolonged stress in general has been known to cause miscarriages, and some
who have been stalked and harassed over a period of time have attributed
their miscarriages to ongoing harassment. Just as the fabricated cut-offs
are likened to getting slapped, these noises are the equivalent of being
repeatedly shocked.
The creators of this program are obviously aware
that these noise campaigns are acts of violence.
Synchronization
Groups will try to synchronize their tactics with things that targets do
such as entering or leaving their homes.
The target's movements will be synchronized with
vehicles or people coming or going, or other movements. These
synchronization tactics are often done several times, perhaps three or more.
For instance, when the target arrives, two cars will drive down their
street, while their next-door neighbor leaves.
If a target has a habit of going to the bathroom at 2 AM and looking out his
bathroom window at a specific area, then they will eventually arrange it so
that there is some activity such as a light being switched on or someone
leaving or arriving in that area.
This is an example of the level of detail that
they will resort to when tailoring a harassment protocol to the profile of a
target.
Synchronization is also used with sensitivity tactics and noise. For
instance, if you're targeted, you'll hear ambulance or fire truck sirens the
moment you enter or leave your house. Or car alarms, hammering or some other
type of noise will occur as you look out the window. As you leave your home,
you may notice people walking by, wearing a color or holding an object that
you've been sensitized to.
If you pull into a parking lot, there will
usually be cars arriving or leaving. Synchronization is also used with
blocking/crowding. For instance, as you approach a store's entrance, people
will be either walking in or leaving.
They will often be wearing a color or holding an
object that you have been sensitized to.
A variation of this is echoing and mirroring. Like other forms of non-verbal
communication, echoing and mirroring are very powerful, (but usually
unconscious) ways of interrelating. This form of information exchange has
been outlined in the book, Secrets of Sexual Body Language: Understanding
Non-Verbal Communication, by Martin Lloyed-Elliot.
Most of us speak this language without even
knowing it to attract others.
However, this form of communication has evidently been incorporated into
this program as a tool to annoy targets. With echoing for instance, if a
target is in a restaurant, or on public transportation, and they drink then
an informant next to them will drink. If they pull out a cell phone, then
the informant will produce a cell pone or similar device.
When the target puts it away, so do they. In
essence, they will mimic the movements of a target.
With mirroring for example, targets may frequently have a person or group of
people walking parallel to them, in the same direction on the other side of
a street, or any public area. Also, there may be someone directly in front
of the target, and approaching the same intersection that they're
approaching.
The informants adjust their timing so they
approach at the same time, and cross the street just as the target does, at
which point crowding may occur. The informant(s) may also be wearing red,
holding cell a phone or another device, which the target has been sensitized
to.
Dr. Alexander and Janet Morris also spoke of the
use of mirroring to influence people, in their book, The Warrior's Edge.
Harassment Skits (Street Theatre)
Commonly used routes are used as avenues
for various types of Street Theatre that unfold as targets pass through.
Street Theatre is used during group stalking and
contains verbal and non-verbal harassment, threats, insults, intimidation,
and violence, conveyed overtly, or covertly using themes, symbolism, or
other medium. They may be carried out after a target has been sensitized
using NLP. This harassment can be relayed with metaphors, verbal remarks,
and symbolism using clothing or other items.
Targets may be stalked by a network of people
who frequently stomp their feet, clear their throat or cough (even in the
middle of summer) to indicate that they're part of the program.
Stalkers may be speaking on their cell phone and loudly accent the insult as
they walk by and stare at targeted people. Blatant, hostile or smirking
stares are also common. Sometimes they may not be on the phone and may just
overtly insult you as they walk by.
As an example, I have people walk by me and say
things like fuck you, fuck-up, fuck-head, you're disgusting, etc. I've also
witnessed them spit in my direction as I walk by them and have seen this
spitting tactic used by teenagers who would spit on the lawn while I was on
the front porch as they passed by my former residence.
Some words carry with them a particular weight to potentially trigger an
effect on a person's emotional state.
For instance, if you're at a restaurant you may
have a couple sit down at a table next to you, and mention some events that
are taking place in your personal life, in order to get your attention.
After that they may make repeated references words such as paranoid, crazy,
scared, panic, insane, freak, sad, depressed, etc. The idea is that the
words will invoke the emotion.
Not only is this possible, but it works best
when you don't know it's being done to you.
This tactic appears to be a variation of a pacing technique used in
hypnosis. It involves first linking something to the subject's ongoing
experience (or personal life) and then using certain words intended to evoke
a particular response.
Morris and Alexander refer to these words as
"verbal anchors" and state,
"Verbal anchors can also be effective
tools... Words such as freeze or duck transmit complete messages...
Verbal anchors can elicit both positive and negative states."
In addition these words can be emphasized by
changing their tone and volume when they're spoken, so that some words are
slightly louder and spoken longer than the others.
This can completely change the meaning of a
message. This is called metacommunication.
Metamessages are suggestions hidden in a
statement, perhaps a compliment. The tone, volume, and rhythm of specific
words in the sentence are changed so that the actual message is different
than what the spoken words are.
"It's hard to defend against the anger and
disapproval expressed in negative metamessages," stated McKay, Davis,
and Fanning, in their book, Messages: The Communication Skills Book.
"The attack is often so subtle that you
aren't aware of exactly how you've been hurt..." The basic function of
metamessages," they say, "is to say something covertly that you're
afraid to say directly. Since metamessage attack is covert, there is
little chance of overt retaliation."
These metamessages are quite similar to indirect
imbedded messages used in hypnosis.
In the book, Patterns of Hypnotic Techniques of
Milton H. Erickson, M.D., Richard Bandler and John Grinder provide examples
of a master hypnotist named Erickson.
Describing this type of covert communication,
they write,
"Imbedded commands serve the purpose of
making suggestions to the client indirectly and, thereby, making it
difficult to resist in any way... These are most effective when they are
also marked analogically by emphasizing the command and by looking
intently at the listener, if their eyes are open."
It appears a variation of this message can be
conveyed with multiple people blitzing a person with cut-offs while talking
on their cell phones, looking directly at the person and emphasizing (metacommunication)
weighted words and/or information about the person's personal life that was
obtained from surveillance.
Groups will also use these phony conversations
to harass targets in stores, restaurants, public places, elevators, etc.
McKinney wrote of recurrent negative comments by strangers that are
apparently intended to evoke feelings of "paranoia." She also wrote in her
report that the stalkers operate in large groups over a long period of time
- seemingly with the support of the government.
Bandler and Grinder describe a positive use of this tactic when quoting
Erickson addressing an anxious patient, with,
"My friends tell me to feel comfortable and
to loosen up when we are out on the town."
Note that the italicized words are emphasized
when spoken. This tactic can be used even if the intended subject is not
being addressed directly, hence the name "Indirect Imbedded Command."
Again, something about the target's personal life or real-time ongoing
experience is mentioned near him so he will identify himself as the subject,
then weighted words conveying insults are used.
These covert public mocking tactics using
trigger words which are intended to evoke negative emotions, are based on
NLP/hypnosis, and seem to be the result of an in-depth study of hypnosis by
the CIA which occurred during the MKULTRA period.
"When we hear something, even from another
conversation, we can't help but make images and sounds of it in our
head," announce Adreas and Faulkner. "The professional persuader knows
this intuitively. In NLP we know it explicitly."
They affirm,
"You cannot NOT communicate."
The use of NLP/hypnosis by these citizen
stalkers as directed by their handlers is obviously intended to drive people
insane.
Victor Santoro explains how these tactics can be used in a destructive
format, as a way to "foster your target's paranoia" and "suggest that he's
being mocked..."
He explains,
"If you can get several accomplices to do
this... he'll get the feeling that mockery and ridicule of him are
widespread."
Santoro's book seems to have some accurate
information pertaining to this program, which makes me wonder if at some
point he was employed as an intelligence agent.
At any rate, the Hidden Evil was obviously
designed by experts in the behavioral sciences.
After a target has been sensitized, they can even be harassed, insulted, and
threatened with symbolism using articles of clothing, newspapers, and other
items. Just as body communication (Social Kinesics) is used to harass a
target, so too is symbolic communication. Symbolism can be used with
articles of clothing, especially during a wave attack where a target is
blitzed by a crowd of informants who smile, laugh, stare at them, and cut
them off as they pass.
Some of the messages I've noticed on apparel
include: Stop and Die, Big Bro, Watch Your Back, as well as Satanic,
Freemasonry, and Wicca symbols.
An attention-getting tactic may be used. It can
be a cut-off, blatant stare, loud noise, or other sensitivity tactics.
Remember how the perpetrators at the YMCA both used an attention-getting
tactic? One man gave me a smirking stare and the other two swarmed me.
In essence, they will take an event that is unfolding in a target's personal
life and make references to it using any number of methods. Interestingly,
an article in the San Francisco Bay Guardian, on October 22, 2004, entitled,
The New COINTELPRO, stated similar that tactics were being used on
protesters at anti-corporate rallies.
The theme may pertain to something in your
personal life. They may play on this theme for a single day, a series of
days, or weeks. In addition, they may choose a theme and try to project it
into your life.
Personally, I doubt that most of the citizens
who are used to flash these messages are aware of their meaning.
Footnotes
* This Idea was taken from Gary Allen's
book, None Dare Call It Conspiracy.
** Words such as "crowding" and "space invasion" have not been
specifically mentioned in the material which I've found relating to the
East German and Russian citizens watch networks. So this seems to be a
new tactic, which is now used worldwide by this global stalking group.
Although, the book, Stasiland, by Anna Funder, does hint that at least
one target regularly experienced this type of crowding attack.
*** He also wrote of the use of stink bombs to induce gagging or
vomiting, and infesting the dwellings of targeted individuals with
insects.
