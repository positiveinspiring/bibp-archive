Its Wipe Out Time
The
elite have sucked the life and vitality from the American
financial system yet Vice President Joe Biden complains that he is
being driven crazy because so many people are betting on Americas demise.
Reports of it are not just exaggerated; they
are, he insists, ridiculous.
Like President
Obama,
he will not accept second place for the United States. Despite the
present crippling budget deficit and the crushing burden of projected
debt, he denies that the country is destined to fulfill a,
prophecy that we are going to be a great
nation that has failed because we lost control of our economy and
overextended.
If we cede the ground to those who suggest that - I dont mean
foreigners, I mean domestic critics - that somehow, we are destined
..to
be a great nation that has failed because we lost control of our economy
and overextended, then we might as well throw it in now, cried out
Biden.
-
Throw it in now?
-
What could that possibly mean?
-
Call all our military boys home from
their thousand bases around the world and cut our military budget to
pieces?
-
Dismantle Homeland Security?
-
Default on all US bonds and start all
over with a new monetary system?
-
How about firing everyone at the CIA?
-
Or you think there is a possibility of
us coming to our senses, finding some speck of humility, living
within our means and stop being the most aggressive country in the
world?
We will continue to be the most significant
and dominant influence in the world as long as our economy is strong,
growing and responsive to 21st-century needs, insisted Biden.
But Bob Herbert of the Times was recently
asking,
How loud do the alarms have to get? There
is an economic emergency in the country with millions upon millions of
Americans riddled with fear and anxiety as they struggle with long-term
joblessness, home foreclosures, personal bankruptcies and dwindling
opportunities for themselves and their children.
Some 5 million more people claim unemployment
benefits than a year ago. How many more will fall off the deep end, we
simply dont know.
And yet with alarm bells ringing all over the country president Obamas
shift from stimulus spending to deficit reduction in his new budget for the
2011 to 2020 fiscal years assumes that the economy will have fully recovered
from
the worst recession in eight decades.
This is the biggest assumption perhaps ever made
(measurable in trillions of dollars and immense consequences) with more
hanging in the balance then most Americans can possibly imagine. The
president might as well be telling everyone Detroit will recover or that
Gary Indiana will come back from the dead or that States will balance their
budgets.
It is wipe out time and one might as well resign oneself to the facts
of life as they are going to be ruthlessly dished out to citizens all over
the first world. The entire system of infinite debt accumulation teeters on
a cliffs edge and the drop down is precipitous.
But alas this is not how policy makers in public
see it and what they think in private is anyones guess.
The American dream has turned into a
nightmare. Led by the selfish, materialistic, self-absorbed Boomers, the
nation has degenerated into an individualistic society of wealth
seekers. The countrys common good and attitudes of thrift, hard work,
and self reliance have been cast aside for the corporate good, immediate
material satisfaction, and entitlement attitude. America is no longer
the land of opportunity. It is the land of corporate fascism,
benefitting the few, writes The Burning Platform.
What is standing in the way of events proceeding
along their natural course is a pathetic type of wishful thinking that is
official policy in England, the United States and many parts of the rest of
the world.
In a speech in London, the Prime Minister will
insist that the Conservatives plans to tackle the deficit by cutting
spending this year would undermine the recovery.
What recovery?
How can we use something that simply does not
exist; hallucinations to rationalize anything we should or should not do?
The English, after centuries of brutal British
Colonialism,
have not a clue that they might have produced some measure
of discontent among the brutalized. Americans similarly
are clueless to the consequences of their nations policies.
Despite growing warnings from economists and
business leaders that the size of the deficit poses a grave threat to
Britains economic future, Labour says public spending should not be cut
before 2011/12.
Instead of helping a recovery, their hatred
of government action would risk the recovery, Mr Brown will say.
Instead of defending ordinary families, they would kick the ladder of
opportunity away from ordinary families.
Its hard to appreciate the cost of helping to
ensure something that is not and never was going to happen.
What our public servants have been saying are:
Ensuring the recovery
Protecting frontline services
Standing up for the many
Protecting future jobs and new industries
Nice to say and think these altruistic
sentiments but when we are delivering to the public the opposite of what we
say, what do we have?
20 reasons why the U.S. economy is
dying and is simply not going to recover.
Massive layoffs are on the horizon for city and
state workers across the country.
American society is going to be gutted right
across its middle and exactly where it will hurt the most. Police and fire
departments will be devastated and public education will become a shadow of
what it once was. Cities, states, and municipalities are sinking as you read
this and unless unions agree to concessions (which they wont) massive
layoffs are coming everywhere you look.
This is just the beginning of the real crisis,
not the end as we were most recently led to believe.
Plummeting housing prices and record
foreclosures are responsible for double-digit declines this year in
residential property taxes, which communities use for police and fire
protection, jails, senior programs, libraries and other services. Budgets
across the nation are in freefall and thats not only deflationary, its
devastating to a way of life that Americans simply got too used to.
In addition, aid for other services such as soup kitchens, homeless shelters
and transit cards for students are being cut, funding to libraries,
reductions in the number of caseworkers who deal with
H.I.V. and AIDS, elimination of nurses in elementary schools,
closure of senior centers and numerous sports complexes and community
centers.
Funding for the arts and after-school programs
also are being slashed.
The order of collapse could be moving from
deflation to inflation, hyperinflation then back to deflation and lastly
a historically predictable world war to escape the final disaster.
War is always the final solution to
divert the attention the public from their pathetic broken
economic existence. Civil disorder appeared last summer in several
countries instigated by hungry, jobless people from working classes.
So far its been contained to car fires,
vandalism, protest marches and small riots. The deeper we go into
Greater Depression II, the worse it gets expanding into stronger and
more wide-spread violence, writes Roger Wiegand.
Then we will relearn the meaning of insecurity
and fear.
We are fast approaching the stage of the
ultimate inversion: the
stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases, while
the citizens may act only by permission; which is the stage of the
darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by brute force.
Ayn Rand
As the global government and the financial
takeover accelerates, its becoming harder and harder for the elite to
hide the true intention of what they are doing, which is centralizing
power into fewer hands, destroying sovereignty and creating a one world
order run by an unelected, undemocratic authoritarian system, concludes
Paul Joseph Watson.
The withdrawal of trillions of dollars from the world economy will
collapse it and
the Illuminists are well aware of that.
The goal has always been the pauperization of the multitudes worldwide
in order to implement world government and the
new world order. The enslavement of mankind. That is what
this is all about and you had best come to grips with what they intend
to do.
These people have bankrupted almost every
country in the world in this deliberate process. That is why sovereign
debt is the next area they have zeroed in on as one of the last main
cogs of stability to be destroyed along with the devaluation of most
currencies, writes Bob Chapman.
Bob Chapman really opens up a can of
worms with this statement.
He is correct and is talking about the higher
echelons of
the United Nation, The World Health
Organization,
The World Bank,
The IMF, and the head honchos of the
European Union now centered in Brussels who all have been having a good time
while struggling to dominate and control and bring harm to men, women and
children everywhere.
These people are failing in their efforts
(hopeful wishful thinking) at least in their pet areas of mass vaccination
against
fabricated monster viruses from the id. And
in their attempts to convince us that most of us would drown in
rising seas and melting ice so we
should pay cash up front in the form of carbon taxes.
Of course the United States fits in powerfully in the above groups but it
does seem that the richest and most powerful people on earth have seen
through the clouds and understood quite a while ago where this was all
going.
That is with them stealing ever more and
more wealth there was not going to be much left over for the middle and
upper middle class multitudes. And only an idiot could not predict
what the final stages of unlimited credit expansion would end up.
Credit is not money in the final telling (yes we
have been that dumb) but it sure was fun in pretend to be rich land.
The Big Boys Are
Changing their Tune
Developed countries with big budget deficits must start now to prepare
public opinion for the belt-tightening that will be needed starting next
year now says the IMF.
John Lipsky, the International
Monetary Funds first deputy managing director, said the scale of the
adjustment required was so vast that it would have to come through
less-generous health and pension benefits, spending cuts and increased tax
revenues. The IMF in their divine wisdom favors maintaining fiscal
stimulus in 2010 in most advanced economies, but then the brakes need to be
slammed on so it is being advised that governments should make it crystal
clear to their citizens why a return to prudent policies is a necessary.
Though there has been great effort to soften the blows, to bail out the
water from the fast sinking ship, to diminish the pain of unemployment and
loss of income.
To retard in every way possible a collapse but
knowing in the end there is no permanent middle ground. In the end the have
nots will have less then the poor, they will have nothing. The poor in the
first world especially in America have been able to live some kind of life.
But when someone loses their home and their job
and there is no opportunity for future work in the foreseeable future where
is that going to leave breadwinners and their families?
We might be dumb cattle but for sure there are people with money and power
and lots of intelligence staffs around them fully aware of what is coming.
Police forces around the world have been preparing and arming themselves for
battle these past ten years. They are trained in riot control. But even then
who will prevail is anyones guess.
Can what is happening in parts of Russia spread to the United States and
Europe?
The New York Times reported that in the
Russian region of Dagestan, in the North Caucasus fifty-eight police
officers were killed in attacks last year many of them while running errands
or standing at their posts. Last month alone 13 officers were killed in
bombings and gang-land-style shootings.
The gunmen - some combination of Islamist
militants, alienated young people, ordinary criminals and foot soldiers
in private armies - just melt back into the city, to be described in the
next days news reports as persons unknown.
The number of attacks doubled, to 201 last year
from 100 in 2008.
One of the greatest mistakes we have made is to alienate ourselves from our
neighbors, who sometimes live on the other side of the world.
Globalization is a two edged sword. If we
cannot realize ever that what is happening to one is happening to all (in a
spiritual but eventually even in a physical sense) then we will have to face
the consequences no matter what they may be.
Prepare as well as possible for the worst
for it is the worst side of humanity that is beginning to see the
light of day.
