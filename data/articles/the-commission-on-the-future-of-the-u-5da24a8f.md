U.S. Aerospace Industry
(This is basically a follow up, ordered by Bush, to Rumsfeld’s commissions)
**
"The United States aerospace industry plays a major role in our national defense, economic growth, scientific advancement, and quality of life. The Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry studies the issues associated with the future of the industry in the global economy and assesses the future importance of the U.S. aerospace industry for U.S. economic and national security. The Commission's findings and recommendations to the President and the Congress will greatly assist in the development of policies to support a robust U.S. aerospace industry for the twenty-first century. The country owes a debt of gratitude to Chairman Bob Walker and the Members of the Commission for their service to the country in this important endeavor."
The Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry was established by Section 1092 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, Public Law 106-398. The Commission was formed to study the future of the United States aerospace industry in the global economy, particularly in relationship to United States national security; and to assess the future importance of the domestic aerospace industry for the economic and national security of the United States. The Commission will prepare and issue a final report to the President and Congress no later than November 27, 2002. Periodic interim reports may also be issued.
The Commission shall develop and recommend a series of public policy reforms which will permit the U.S. aerospace industry to create superior technology, excel in the global marketplace, profit from investments in human and financial capital, benefit from coordinated and integrated government decision-making, assure our national security, access modern infrastructure, and give the United States a capacity throughout the 21st Century to reach for the stars.
The Commission was given a broad mandate by the Congress to study:
The adequacy of projected budgets of the federal departments and agencies for aerospace research and development and procurement;
The adequacy of the current acquisition process of federal departments and agencies;
The procedures for developing and fielding aerospace systems incorporating new technology in a timely fashion;
The policies, procedures, and methods for the financing and payment of government contracts;
Statutes and regulations governing international trade and the export of technology;
Policies governing taxation, particularly with a view to assessing the impact of current tax laws and practices on the international competitiveness of the aerospace industry;
Programs for the maintenance of the national space launch infrastructure
Programs for the support of science and engineering education.
