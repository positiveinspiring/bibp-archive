I. The World TodayWhat are the causes
which have produced present world conditions? What are the underlying pressures which are
producing the present chaos or those which can produce eventual order? Before there can be
correction, there must be appreciation of error; there must be understanding of the
predisposing causes producing the necessity; there must be realization of the general
guilt and a shared responsibility for the evil conditions; there must be determination to
make restitution, and to cease from evil doing.
The tendency to fasten the war on Hitler and his gang of evil men should not blind us
to the causes which have made his evil work possible. He is mainly a precipitating agency,
for through him world selfishness and cruelty have been brought to a focus. But, as Christ
has said: "Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences
come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh." (Matthew 18:7.) The causes of
this rampant evil are inherent in humanity itself.
Ancient and untrammeled selfishness has ever been a characteristic of man; the desire
for power and for possession has ever motivated men and nations; cruelty, lust, and
sacrifice of the higher values to the lower have been deeply rooted human habits for ages.
Of these ancient habits of thought and behavior all peoples and all nations are guilty.
Steadily, [182] as the world grew closer, the lines of cleavage and the antagonism of the
nations increased, and thus the present war (beginning in 1914) is the inevitable result
of wrong thought, selfish goals and ancient hatreds. Individualistic interest, separative
aims and aggressive desire march towards their inevitable finale - war and chaos.
