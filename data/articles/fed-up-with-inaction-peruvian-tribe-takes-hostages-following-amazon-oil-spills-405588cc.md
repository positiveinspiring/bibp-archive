After learning that they
would be excluded from an official state of emergency
declared in the wake of
two catastrophic oil spills
in the Peruvian Amazon, members of
the Wampis community of
Mayuriaga stopped a helicopter from taking off late
Sunday evening and held 8 officials hostage to force the
government to respond to their desperate pleas for help.
More than a month after the
spills devastated many Indigenous communities' water
supplies, there is little end in sight to the suffering
of those most affected.
"Though officials refer
to the second leak as 'the Mayuriaga spill' because
it took place in Mayuriaga," Reuters
reported, "the
government did not include the community in an
official list of affected groups that would receive
emergency supplies and attention."

The official state of
emergency was declared by the central government on
February 29th.
The spills contaminated the
food and water supplies of 20 communities, a local
Indigenous group
reported, but the
central government initially offered emergency
assistance to only 16.
"This oil spill has
already resulted in severe and irreparable harm to
the community lands of Mayuriaga and to our
collective territory as a people. Responsibility
lies squarely with [the oil company] Petroperu, who
have acted with complete negligence," Wrays Perez
Ramirez, who was elected president of the Wampis
after they formed a government last November,
told RT.
"Over more than 40 years
they have failed to maintain and repair their
pipeline knowing full well that it needs constant
maintenance and replacement every 10-15 years."
The grounded helicopter
belonged to the Peruvian military, and it was
transporting government and Petroperu officials to the
region to inspect the damage from the spills.
Reuters
reports:
The government will
amend the emergency decree, published last month, to
include Mayuriaga, said Deputy Culture Minister
Patricia Balbuena.
Balbuena said a local
government compiled the list and it was not clear
why it excluded Mayuriaga.
"It's a mistake that
should be corrected as soon as possible," Balbuena
said.
It remains unclear whether
officials have spoken with the tribe directly.
"The Peruvian Air Force
said in a statement that a group of officials would
visit the area Monday, including the president of
PetroPeru in order to hear the protesters demands,"
teleSUR
reported.
"The statement added
that the crew were being treated well and that the
helicopter had not been damaged."
As of Tuesday, there have
been no further reports regarding what meetings took
place.
The state-owned oil company
Petroperu was responsible for the pipeline breakages
that led to the horrific spills that poured 3,000
barrels of oil into Amazon tributaries, causing
"incalculable damage" to one of the most biodiverse
areas of the tropical forest,
according to
Scientific American.
"The people affected [by
the spills] are suffering from nausea, vomiting,
dizziness, and diarrhea," teleSUR reported.
The Peruvian environmental
regulator has stated that the recent spills were "not
isolated incidents," RT reported, and that the
oil company had failed to respond to 20 smaller spills
from its pipelines in the Amazon since the regulatory
body was formed in 2011.
One of the Petroperu
officials taken hostage
told the Peruvian news
outlet RPP while he was being detained that the
native community was respectful and peaceful.
He noted that the Mayuriaga
community is simply attempting to ensure a meeting with
government officials so that the tribe is finally
provided the assistance it feels it is owed.
Despite the peaceful nature
of the group's action, local non-profit news agency
Servindi
warned that Peruvian
activists and humanitarian organizations fear,
"that the measures taken
by the community may lead to a repressive action by
security forces."
