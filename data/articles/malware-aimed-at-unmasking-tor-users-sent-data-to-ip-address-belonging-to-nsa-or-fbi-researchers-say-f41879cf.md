Malware aimed at uncovering the anonymous
identities of Tor users reportedly sent information to an IP address that
belongs to the National Security Agency (NSA),
routed through Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).
Tor, an anonymity network
originally short for The Onion Router, was developed with
contributions from
individuals who worked for the Navy and
the NSA. This latest revelation comes as the NSA is under increasingly
intense scrutiny around the world for their data harvesting activities.
It also comes on the heels of a report stating
that the FBI regularly employs hackers to develop malware and an earlier
report which stated that the US government is the
worlds largest buyer of malware.
The NSA link was uncovered by researchers from
Baneki Privacy Labs, a group of Internet security researchers,
along with
CryptoCloud (plus
CriptoStorm.is and
CriptoStorm.org), a VPN provider.
The IP address,
hardcoded into the
JavaScript exploit, was discovered by
Cryptocloud but a Baneki source told
Ars Technica that they reached out to other
researchers in the malware and security
community to identify the source.
The exploit specifically targeted
FireFox Extended Support Release 17 for
Windows, the same browser that was released as a part of the Tor Projects
Tor Browser Bundle.
The vulnerability exploited was patched by
Mozilla in June of this year and the patched version is part of the new
Browser Bundle.
However, Ars points out that,
the TBB configuration of
Firefox doesnt include automatic
security updates, so users of the bundle would not have been protected
if they had not recently upgraded.
Early investigations traced the IP address back
to SAIC, which incidentally provides support to the Department of Defense in
the areas of information technology and Command, Control, Communications,
Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR).
The IP address was specifically tracked to the
SAIC facility in Arlington, Virginia,
though further analysis turned up that it went beyond the defense
contractor.
Research using
Robtex, a DNS record tool, found that the IP address was part of
one of many blocks of IP addresses which have been
permanently assigned to the NSA.
Ars Technica points out that this discovery is
one of two things: a laughable mistake by someone working for either the NSA
or SAIC, or,
an intentional calling card as some
analyzing the attack have suggested.
An individual posting on Cryptoclouds
discussion forum
speculated,
Its psyops - a fear campaign
They want to
scare folks off Tor, scare folks off all privacy services.
Kevil Poulsen, writing for Wireds
Threat Level, on the other hand,
believes that the FBI is the prime suspect.
It just sends identifying information to
some IP in Reston, Virginia, Vlad Tsrklevich, a reverse-engineer, said
to Wired. Its pretty clear that its FBI or its some other law
enforcement agency thats U.S.-based.
They note that if Vlad Tsrklevich and
others are correct, it could be the FBIs
computer and internet protocol
address verifier (CIPAV).
CIPAV is a piece of law enforcement spyware
first covered by Wired back in 2007, though
it has
reportedly been in use since 2002.
SAIC has not responded to attempts by Wired to
get a comment on the story, and Poulsen notes that SAIC is a contractor for
the FBI.
The discovery of the exploit came
soon after the FBI reportedly
sought to extradite Eric Eoin Marques,
28-year-old founder of Freedom Host, on child pornography charges.
It also came after individuals involved with the
Tor Project
reported the disappearance of numerous so-called hidden service
addresses that were used by Freedom Hosting.
The confluence of the three events has
prompted speculation that the de-anonymizing exploit is the work of the
FBI or another organized group targeting child pornographers, Ars
Technica
reports.
Because this payload does not download or
execute any secondary backdoor or commands its very likely that this is
being operated by an LEA [law-enforcement agent] and not by blackhats,
Tsrklevich wrote, according to Ars.
It seems that the evidence indicating that the
IP address is linked to the NSA is quite strong, though if that is the case,
they almost certainly provided information to the FBI in relation to the
Marques case mentioned above.
