"All war is based on deception."
Sun Tzu
The Art of War
There is nothing new in a government lying to
their people to start a war.
Indeed because most people prefer living in
peace to bloody and horrific death in war, any government that desires to
initiate a war usually lies to their people to create the illusion that
support for the war is the only possible choice they can make.
- President McKinley told the
American people that the
USS Maine had been sunk in Havana Harbor
by a Spanish mine.
The American people, outraged by this
apparent unprovoked attack, supported the Spanish American War. The
Captain of the USS Maine had insisted the ship was sunk by a coal bin
explosion, investigations after the war proved that such had indeed been
the case. There had been no mine.
- Hitler used this principle of
lying to his own people to initiate an invasion.
He told the people of Germany (below audio)
that Poland had attacked first and staged
fake attacks against German targets.
The Germans, convinced they were being
threatened, followed Hitler into Poland and into World War 2.
- FDR claimed Pearl Harbor was
a surprise attack.
It wasn't.
The United States saw war with Japan as the
means to get into war with Germany, which Americans opposed. So
Roosevelt needed Japan to appear to strike first. Following
an 8-step
plan devised by the Office of Naval Intelligence, Roosevelt
intentionally provoked Japan into the attack.
Contrary to the official story, the fleet
did not maintain radio silence, but sent messages intercepted and
decoded by
US intercept stations. Tricked by the lie of a surprise
attack, Americans marched off to war.
- President Johnson
lied about
the Gulf of Tonkin to send Americans off to fight in Vietnam.
There were no torpedoes in the water in the Gulf. LBJ took advantage of
an inexperienced sonar man's report to goad Congress into escalating the
Vietnam War.
It is inescapable historical reality that
leaders of nations will lie to their people to trick them into wars they
otherwise would have refused. It is not "conspiracy theory" to suggest that
leaders of nations lie to trick their people into wars. It is undeniable
fact.
This brings us to the present case.
Did the government of the United States lie to the American people, more to
the point, did President
Bush and his Neocon associates lie to
Congress, to initiate a war of conquest in Iraq?
This question has been given currency by
a memo leaked from inside the
British Government which clearly indicates a decision to go to war followed
by the "fixing" of information around that policy. This is, as they say, a
smoking gun.
But the fact is that long before this memo surfaced, it had become obvious
that the US Government, aided by that of Great Britain, was lying to create
the public support for a war in Iraq.
- First off is Tony Blair's
"Dodgy Dossier" (click below image), a document released by the Prime Minister that made
many of the claims used to support the push for war. The dossier soon
collapsed when it was revealed that much of it had been plagiarized from
a student thesis paper that was 12 years old!
The contents of the dossier, however much they seemed to create a good
case for invasion, were obsolete and outdated.
This use of material that could not possibly be relevant at the time is
clear proof of a deliberate attempt to deceive.
- Then there was the claim about the
"Mobile biological weapons laboratories".
Proffered in the absence of any real
laboratories in the wake of the invasion, photos of these trailers were
shown on all the US
Mainstream Media, with the claim they while seeming
to lack anything suggesting biological processing, these were part of a
much larger assembly of multiple trailers that churned out biological
weapons of mass destruction.
- The chief proponent of this hoax was
Colin Powell, who presented illustrations such as this one to
the
United Nations on
February 5th, 2003.
This claim fell apart when it was revealed that these trailers were
nothing more than hydrogen gas generators used to inflate weather
balloons. This fact was already known to both the US and UK, as a
British company manufactured the units and sold them to Iraq.
- Colin Powell's speech to the UN was
itself one misstatement after another.
Powell claimed that Iraq had purchased
special aluminum tubes whose only possible use was in uranium enrichment
centrifuges. Both CIA and Powell's own State Department confirmed that
the tubes were parts for missiles Saddam was legally allowed to have.
Following the invasion, no centrifuges,
aluminum or otherwise were found.
- Powell also claimed to the United
Nations that the photo on the left showed "Decontamination Vehicles".
But when United Nations inspectors visited the site after the invasion,
they located the vehicles and discovered they were just firefighting
equipment.
Powell claimed the Iraqis had illegal
rockets and launchers hidden in the palm trees of Western Iraq. None
were ever found.
Powell claimed that the Iraqis had 8,500 liters (2245 gallons) of
Anthrax. None was ever found.
- Powell claimed that Iraq had four
tons of VX nerve gas.
The UN had already confirmed that it was
destroyed. The only VX ever found were samples the US had left as
"standards" for testing. When the UN suspected that the US samples had
been used to contaminate Iraqi warheads, the
US moved quickly to destroy
the samples before comparison tests could be carried out.
Powell claimed that Iraq was building long-range remote drones
specifically designed to carry biological weapons. The only drones found
were short-range reconnaissance drones.
Powell claimed that Iraq had an aggregate of between 100 and 500 tons of
chemical and biological warfare agents. Powell gave no basis for that
claim at all, and a DIA report issued the same time directly
contradicted the claim. No biological or chemical weapons were found in
Iraq following the invasion.
Powell claimed that "unnamed sources" confirmed that Saddam had
authorized his field commanders to use biological weapons. No such
weapons were ever used by the Iraqis to defend against the invasion and,
of course, none were ever found in Iraq.
Powell claimed that 122mm warheads found by the UN inspectors were
chemical weapons. The warheads were empty, and showed no signs of ever
having contained chemical weapons.
Powell claimed that Iraq had a secret force of illegal long-range Scud
missiles. None were ever found.
Powell
claimed to have an audio tape proving that Saddam was supporting
Osama Bin Laden.
But independent translation of the tape revealed
Osama's wish for Saddam's death.
- Colin Powell's UN debacle also
included spy photos taken from high flying aircraft and spacecraft.
On the photos were circles and arrows and
labels pointing to various fuzzy white blobs and identifying them as
laboratories and storage areas for Saddam's massive weapons of mass
destruction program. Nothing in the photos actually suggested what the
blobby shapes were and during inspections which followed the invasion,
all of them turned out to be rather benign.
In at least one case, the satellite Powell claimed had taken one of the
pictures had actually
been out of operation at the time.
And many
questioned why Powell was showing black and white photos when the
satellites in use at the time over Iraq
took color images.
- Another piece of evidence consists
of documents which President
Bush referenced as in his 2003 State of the
Union Speech. According to Bush, these documents proved that Iraq was
buying tons of uranium oxide, called "Yellow Cake" from Niger.
(click below image)
Since Israel had bombed Iraq's nuclear power
plant years before, it was claimed that the only reason Saddam would
have for buying uranium oxide was to build bombs.
Osama bin Laden's "Mountain Fortress", shown to the US public by
the corporate media,
and like Saddam's nuclear
weapons, never actually existed.
- This hoax fell apart fast when it
was pointed out that Iraq has a great deal of uranium ore inside their
own borders and no need to import any from Niger or anywhere else.
The I.A.E.A. then blew the cover off the
fraud by announcing that the
documents Bush had used were not only
forgeries, but too obvious to believe that anyone in the Bush
administration did not know they were forgeries!
The forged documents were reported as being
"discovered" in Italy by SISMI, the Italian Security Service. Shortly
before the "discovery" the head of SISMI had been paid a visit by
Michael Ledeen, Manucher Ghorbanifar, and two officials from OSP, one of
whom was Larry Franklin, the Israeli spy operating inside the OSP.
In July, 2005, the Italian Parliament concluded their own investigation
and named four men as suspects in the creation of the forged documents:
-
Michael Ledeen
-
Dewey Clarridge
-
Ahmed Chalabi
-
Francis Brookes
This report has been included in Patrick
Fitzgerald's investigation into the outing of Valerie Plame, and Paul
McNulty, the prosecutor of the AIPAC spy case.
A recently declassified memo proves that the State Department reported
the fact that the Niger documents were forgeries to the CIA 11 days
before President Bush made the claim about the Niger uranium based on
those documents.
In the end, the real proof that we were lied to about Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction is that no weapons of mass destruction were ever found.
That means that every single piece of paper that purported to prove that
Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was by default a fraud, a hoax, and
a lie.
There could be no evidence that supported
the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction because Iraq did not
have weapons of mass destruction. In a way, the existence of any faked
documents about Iraq's WMDs is actually an admission of guilt. If one is
taking the time to create fake documents, the implication is that the
faker is already aware that there are no genuine documents.
What the US Government had, ALL that they had, were copied student
papers, forged "Yellow Cake" documents, balloon inflators posing as
bioweapons labs, and photos with misleading labels on them.
And somewhere along the line, someone
decided to put those misleading labels on those photos, to pretend that
balloon inflators are portable bioweapons labs, and to pass off stolen
student papers as contemporary analysis.
And THAT shows an intention to deceive.
Lawyers call this "Mens Rea", which means
"Guilty Mind". TV lawyer shows call it "Malice aforethought".
This means that not only did the Bush
Administration lie to the people and to the US Congress, but knew
they were
doing something illegal at the time that they did it.
All the talk about "Intelligence failure" is just another lie. There was no
failure.
Indeed the Army agents who
erroneously claimed that missile tubes
were parts for a uranium centrifuge received bonuses, while the
Pentagon
smeared Hans Blix, and John Bolton
orchestrated the firing of Jose
Bustani, the director of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons, because Bustani was trying to send chemical weapons inspectors
to Baghdad.
The President of the United States and his Neocon associates lied to the
people of the United States to send them off on a war of conquest.
Defenders of the government will point to the cases listed at the top of the
page as proof that lying to the people is a normal part of the leader's job
and we should all get used to it.
And because "Everybody does it" that we
should not single out the present administration. But this is madness. We do
not catch all the murderers, yet when we catch a murderer, we deal with them
as harshly as possible, in order to deter more murderers.
Right now, we have the criminals at hand, and, while other leaders in
history have lied to start wars, for the first time in history, the lie
stands exposed while the war started with the lies still rages on, to the
death and detriment of our young men and women in uniform.
We cannot in good moral conscience ignore this
lie, this crime, lest we encourage future leaders to continue to lie to us
to send our kids off to pointless wars.
-
Lying to start a war is more than an
impeachable offence; it the highest possible crime a government can
commit against their own people.
-
Lying to start a war is not only
misappropriation of the nation's military and the nation's money
under false pretenses, but it is outright murder committed on a
massive scale.
-
Lying to start a war is a betrayal of
the trust each and every person who serves in the military places in
their civilian leadership.
By lying to start a war, the Bush administration
has told the military fatalities and their families that they have no right
to know why they were sent to their deaths. It's none of their business.
Our nation is founded on the principle of rule with the consent of the
governed. Because We The People do not consent to be lied to, a government
that lies rules without the consent of the governed, and ruling without the
consent of the governed is slavery.
You should be more than angry. You should be in a rage. You should be in a
rage no less than that of the families of those young men and women who have
been killed and maimed in this war started with a lie.
You need to be in a rage and you need to act on
that rage because even as I type these words, the same government that lied
about Iraq's nuclear weapons is telling the exact same lies about Iran's
nuclear capabilities.
The writing is on the wall; having gotten away
with lying to start the war in Iraq,
the US Government will lie to start a
war in Iran, and after that another, and after that another, and another and
another and another because as long as you remain silent, and as long as you
remain inactive, the liars have no reason to stop.
As long as you remain inactive, the liars have
no reason to stop.
None.
It is time to fire the liars.
