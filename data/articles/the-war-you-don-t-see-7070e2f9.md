A powerful and timely investigation into the medias role in war, tracing
the history of embedded and independent reporting from,
As weapons and propaganda become even more sophisticated, the nature of war
is developing into an electronic battlefield in which journalists play a key
role, and civilians are the victims.
But who is the real enemy?
John Pilger says in the film:
We journalists
have to be brave enough to
defy those who seek our collusion in selling their latest bloody adventure
in someone elses country
That means always challenging the official story,
however patriotic that story may appear, however seductive and insidious it
is.
For propaganda relies on us in the media to aim its deceptions not at a far
away country but at you at home
In this age of endless imperial war, the
lives of countless men, women and children depend on the truth or their
blood is on us
Those whose job it is to keep the record straight ought to
be the voice of people, not power.
