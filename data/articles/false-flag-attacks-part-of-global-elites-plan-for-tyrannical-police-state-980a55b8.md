The Batman shooting has prompted a nationwide dialogue about gun control.
This plays perfectly into the global Elites
schemes to disarm Americans and destroy our 2nd Amendment rights.
Stricter background checks have been suggested to weed-out the pre-crime
potentials. Pro-gun control advocates decry that these safety measures
would save lives in the long run.
If we just give up a few of our Constitutional
freedoms now, we will all be better off later... a familiar call to action
by the global Elite through their propaganda machine called the mainstream
media.
The cover story is that guns in the hands of violent criminals are
dangerous. And potential criminals lurk around every corner. The claims that
legal procurement of firearms is not part of the discussion are distracting
from the truth of the matter. The UN who is discussing the Arms Trade Treaty
(ATT) in New York right now, tell a different tale.
The ATT clearly states that the UN, after Congressional ratification, will
force the US government to:
-
Enact internationally agreed licensing
requirements for Americans
-
Confiscate and destroy unauthorized
firearms of Americans while allowing the US government to keep
theirs
-
Ban trade, sale and private ownership of
semi-automatic guns
-
Create and mandate an international
registry to organize an encompassing gun confiscation in America
At Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic
Medicine, a medical school in Parker, Texas, a planned disaster response
drill under Advanced Disaster Life Support Training was underway while the
shooting in Aurora was underway.
Among the disasters that could be conceived by the drill experts, the
students were proposed how to
effectively respond,
if a shooter fires at people in a movie
theater and also uses a bomb in the attack.
Dr. Bruce Dubin, Rocky Vista dean, commented on
the amazing irony. Dubin said that the shooting scenario was incorporated
into the teaching on Friday.
The propaganda campaign worked, as Dubin
remarked that,
It made these medical students very aware
that these kinds of things can happen anywhere. The events of this
tragedy have helped to drive that home.
While the general public is unaware of the
correlations between the shooting and current movement of the Obama
administration to enact UN policies on gun control within the US, the
conspiratorial aspect of the case may be used by the mainstream media to
cloud the real issue.
Obama has gone to Colorado to
make PR visits with the victims of the
shooting as comforter-in-chief and use this opportunity to quote scripture
and,
come to [the victims] not so much as a
president, [but] as a father and husband.
The psy-op surrounding James Holmes, the alleged
shooter, brings to light some interesting questions.
One worth exploring is the
para-military grab
Holmes wore to the theater. It was identical to the new outfits we see local
law enforcement donning as a staged move toward changing the social meme
about what it means to be a police officer. Where it used to be a cop wore a
button-down shirt and slacks, now Americans must be convinced that regular
police walk around ready for a violent SWAT team like altercation every day.
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been involved with psy-ops
involving mind-control techniques using every day pasty-types that become
the public focal point that overshadows the real crime being perpetrated
against America.
In the 1950s, Project MKUltra was a CIA controlled covert research project
into human behavior modification where unwitting US and Canadian citizens
were used as
test subjects.
Several drugs, including LSD and mescaline, were
used to create methodologies to alter brain functions and induce mental
states where the subject would be under complete control. These subjects
were literally real Manchurian Candidates.
Under research conducted during MKUltra, substances were used to:
-
Promote illogical thinking and
impulsiveness
-
Cause temporary loss of memory
-
Produce amnesia of events before and
during
-
Confusion over time periods
-
Creation of substance undetectable under
biological tests
-
Distortion of hearing and eye-sight
-
Can be administered through food, drink,
cigarettes, aerosols
-
Subject is still conscious to preform
specified actions without retention of cognitive functions
Drugs experimented with during MKUltra were,
-
LSD
-
heroin
-
morphine
-
psilocybin
-
scopolamine
-
marijuana
-
alcohol
-
sodium pentothal
-
ergine
In the 1960s
Operation Northwoods , a plan approved in the 1960s by the
Chairman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff called for civilians to be shot in
America while violent terrorism would be staged across the US.
Pasty
operatives would be framed for bombings, planes would appear to be hijacked
and evidence would be planted to blame Castro in Cuba in an attempt to
produce justification for war with Cuba.
These false flag attacks staged by the US federal agencies such as the FBI
and CIA would include:
-
Planted bombs and explosive materials
-
Intercepted messages with suspected
terrorist organizations
-
Staged hijacking attempts
-
Murder of America citizens to justify US
federal agency agendas
The Obama administration is currently seeking
the US Congress to ratify the ATT which UN Secretary Ban Ki-moon describes
as:
Our goal is clear: a robust and legally
binding Arms Trade Treaty that will have a real impact on the lives of
those millions of people suffering from consequences of armed conflict,
repression and armed violence
It is ambitious, but it is achievable.
The draft of the ATT is scheduled for enactment
this year. Once completed, Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State, has
pledged to push the Senate for ratification. Once international mandate
becomes law in America, our Constitutional Republic will be further
destroyed and prime for control by the global Elite.
The United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs has supposed to quell public protest
by claiming:
The outcome [of the ATT] will not seek to
prohibit citizens of any country from possessing firearms or to
interfere with the legal trade in small arms and light weapons.
Yet once that door is opened and international
law supersedes our US Constitution with the backing of our current
administration it is just a short walk to the destruction of our American
freedoms.
House Representative Mike Kelly
implores:
The UNs actions to date indicate that the
ATT [United Nations Arms Trade Treaty] is likely to pose significant
threats to our national security, foreign policy, and economic interests
as well as our constitutional rights.
The U.S. must establish firm red lines for
the ATT and state unequivocally that it will oppose the ATT if it
infringes on our rights or threatens our ability to defend our
interests.
Chris Cox of the National Rifle Association
(NRA) also warn that:
Any international Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)
that in any way, shape or form affects the constitutional rights of
American gun owners is unacceptable. International organizations and
foreign governments do not have the right to restrict the fundamental
freedoms handed down to us from our Founding Fathers.
The UN has never definitively defined what
terrorism is and the UN Security Council, regardless of treaties signed, has
not effectively stopped any oppositional group from enacting a violent
display.
In fact,
the UN has covertly supported terrorist groups
under the
guise of struggling against foreign occupations.
The ATT and the Obama administrations support of it is a coercive attempt
to disarm all the citizens of America.
In order to reclaim America for
the global Elite
under a tyrannical police state, the disarmament of US citizens is
imperative...
