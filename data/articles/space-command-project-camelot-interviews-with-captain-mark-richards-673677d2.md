# Space Command - Project Camelot Interviews with Captain Mark Richards

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalmilitarism180.htm

Hi, this is Kerry Cassidy and I have just come back from interviewing
Mark Richards in the
Vacaville Prison, and this has been a fascinating
experience I have to say.
Way over the top, I mean just amazing! A
very interesting man, definitely a military man of Germanic and British
background, heritage, and DNA - all that. Very, very knowledgeable about
the Secret Space Program, and everything intending on that. I literally
peppered him with questions nonstop.
I can tell you that, for all intents and purposes, he is exactly who he
says he is.
This is what appears to be the truth. He was very, very well informed,
very well read, very gracious, very astute, and answered all my
questions very clearly.
There was no attempt, or at least obvious
attempt at obfuscation, and I am going to just reel out the information
I was given, which in some cases is kind of mind blowing and yet a
validation of most of what I have been given or what I know from the
eight years in Camelot.
I can just say that this is a person who really knows what he is talking
about, and who is able to answer me from his own experience - very
direct experience. He has been a Captain in the Navy. His father was, I
guess, a high-ranking Air Force person, and also in the military.
Both
of them were in the Secret Space Program.
The kind of questions I asked him had to do
with getting verification on who is running the planet, what the various
races are, who are visiting here, and who are interacting with humans
and aligning themselves with various countries, governments, and
military factions.
And so I was really asking him very high-level sophisticated kinds of
questions. It wasn't just, you know, what are the kinds of aliens, and
what do they look like, although we do have some of that in there.
He made some very clear statements that I
will state here. And, again, this is me going off my memory from just
having been there for about two hours in conversation with him, and I
didn't have any pen or paper, was not allowed to keep notes of any kind,
so everything comes off my memory.
We are doing this right now so that I will
have a clear record, and so that I can also document for the public what
I have just learned.
Apparently it appears that he was given an okay to release this
information gradually, and I am the first person who has gone to
interview him in an official capacity. There have apparently been a few
visitors who are friends, who became friends with him and Jo Ann, his
wife.
But for all intents and purposes this is the very first time he
has been interviewed in this way and for the purpose of release to the
public.
I can say that he talked about
races of ETs that he dealt with directly
through the years and they involve first and foremost what he calls the
Raptors and the Raptor race being a group who look like the
Velociraptors to some degree, and I guess maybe they are even descended
from them.
They consider the earth theirs, that they
are an indigenous species to the earth and that they really did die out.
Actually they left during the end of the dinosaur era, but then some
survived and they returned apparently, and they are interacting very
directly with our military. They have a joint base and joint operations
going on, or had in the Falklands, and a current, I believe, base down
there. They are a species that, you know, really do look like the
pictures of them, like in Jurassic Park.
They love our luxury items. I was told that they also love cars, luxury
cars and things like that. They have a set of family values. Their first
approach to us was back in, if I remember correctly, 1951 give or take,
and that their interaction was initially sort of negative with our race.
But once they established relationships, we have become, I guess, tacit
colleagues.
They call us allies, human allies. However
their initial impulse is to eat humans, and they still can do so at any
given point if they get mad or whatever.
I was given an example that somebody could be having a friendly
relationship, you know, talking with them but if they got angry, they
could turn around and eat the kid, you know, that they liked to eat
humans. But when you get in these military relationships with them they
refrain, the way you could imagine a vampire might refrain. In other
words, they still have the capacity, but they refrain from exercising
it.
So they have been establishing and evolving over the last 40 or 50
years, or whatever it is, their relationship with the humans. They have
a very close relationship with Mark Richards actually, who seems to have
a very good friend who is among them.
What he did describe was relationships as they exist between military
and various alien races are not uniform. In other words they have some
individuals or actually factions within each group that may be more
predisposed to be favorable toward humans, and then others that are less
so, even within the same races.
I did ask him about overall agendas for each group. There are two
races
of Reptilians - actually there are many more races of Reptilians - but
there are two major races of reptilians that are antagonistic toward
humans and that want to take over the earth, take back the earth for
their own.
They do consider that they own the earth,
and also are battling with the Raptor race for ownership of the earth.
The humans are helping the Raptors and the
Raptor race is helping the humans to battle these reptilian races, these
two races that both have differing agendas but more or less have to do
with taking back the earth.
One group of reptilians is more humanoid, standing on their legs and so
on and is more human-like, and has even lost, over time, their tail and
so on and so forth. And then there is another race that is like a more
traditional reptoid looking race with tails. And neither group is
positively oriented toward humans for the most part.
There is a group
of
Draco. They have the wings. We know of them as the
Ciakars. We didn't get a lot of time to discuss that but he did talk
about them being a different race altogether.
And then there are, in other words, so many different races that are
operational here, and that are coming in and out of the planet, even
though our atmosphere is very hard for many of them to deal with, for
the most part.
He did agree that the terra farming of the
planet, as I have stated in Camelot numerous times, with the methane and
the Fukushima disaster involving radiation, is an effort to make the
planet more amenable to certain races of beings, including the
Reptilians so that they can be in our atmosphere more easily.
That is the agenda. That is one of the agendas.
The other, and I know
I'm going to be jumping around because I have to grab my memory from all
the different areas that we talked about, but basically what is
happening is that they are terra farming this planet. And they are
looking to take the radiation to create a Humanity 2.0.
They are looking for mutants, just as the
X-men movie states. In other words radiation can cause mutations that
can be positive mutations for a race of beings, and that's what they are
hoping to land on, is some more superpowers access from that. Certainly
I think being able to travel in space more easily is an example, as one
can better withstand radiation.
We talked about so many things I'm just going to fire, you know, like a
shotgun kind of thing here, because it was really quite substantial.
I
mean I barely gave him any time to breathe because I was asking him
things just like that [snaps fingers]. And at no point did he ever
hesitate, and when he didn't know something he was clear. If I said
something that was too general, he asked me to be more specific.
We did have a good rapport and were easily
able to talk to each other. He comes from a Germanic-English background.
He has blue eyes and light skin and looks fairly Germanic. He was
definitely a high-ranking officer in the Secret Space Program.
He was framed. The murder actually happened when he wasn't even here. He
was on an assignment and had just come back and was having a meal with
his mother when the actual, I guess, thing occurred.
But, for all intents and purposes he was not
able to defend himself because he was away on a mission during the time
when the plotting was supposed to be going on, along with all the other
things he was accused of. And, certainly you can't use your secret
mission as a defense in a proceeding of this nature, because it violates
the security oath for one thing, and for another thing, no one would
believe him.
Okay, so there are also... we talked about
the Greys. We talked about
Dulce,
the Dulce battle.
He talked about violence as being a real last
resort. He said in some ways they were kind of young and naïve back in
those days during the Dulce battle, that they went in and it was
supposed to be a friendly threat, rather than an overt threat, or a
down-and-out battle.
But it devolved into a battle because they
simply didn't know how to handle it, and [they] ended up having to kill
a number of the Greys, etcetera, in order to try to free the humans that
were being experimented on there.
He agreed with me. He said that they were sent in by Carter, and that
prior to that, I questioned him about Eisenhower and that witness that
is out there talking about how they went in to invade during the
Eisenhower administration. He said Eisenhower wanted the place nuked.
And in fact, nuking is one of the ways that they do go in and that they
are fighting battles.
He talked about the fact that there was...
Sean David Morton has a whistleblower that he wrote a book about, and so
I was curious whether that whistleblower's testimony was correct, and
basically it apparently is.
There was, or is, an alien who runs that place who is not a Grey. Most
of the Greys are clones he said.
They use these interdimensional gates that
require them to dematerialize, and when they rematerialize on the other
end, they are not the same beings, and the humans can do the same thing,
but that they hesitate, and most of them, like even Mark himself, will
not go through certain kinds of gates that require them
to dematerialize
because when they reappear on the other side, they basically have to die
to show up there.
They do show up in their human form with all
their memories intact, etcetera, but they are not the same exact being
as the one who left there. It's a duplicate, so to speak.
And if they come back and they cross back over, they again have to die,
dematerialize, and rematerialize, again in the same configuration which
we have, but he said it's very detrimental. There tends to be a
degrading process that goes on in those kind of gates, and that he
declined to use them as a result.
He said the Greys use them, however,
all the time, and that is part of the reason that their race is so
devolved on certain physical levels, and he says it also affects the
mental capacity.
He does say that he himself was augmented. I asked him if his
intelligence was augmented in other capacities. He alluded to the fact
that, yes, he has been augmented, as many of the Secret Space Program
military have been. And this is the case with most of the people I have
talked to, who are part of that program, especially on the more secret
side, and this is even before the days of what we call supersoldiers.
He said that there is a great deal of truth in the supersoldier story
involving augmentation and what I call
robotic supermen, and he verified
that that is their agenda. That is being carried out. And he thinks that
the Nano is the most dangerous side of that. He said he had had direct
experience with the Nano, although we didn't have time to talk about in
what way.
Okay, so I was very interested in knowing who is running planet Earth
and the bottom line, he said, is no one is running planet Earth.
And the reason is because they are all, more
or less, at war with each other within the various races of ETs that are
visiting here, some of whom believe they own the planet as well as the
humans.
In other words, just as each of our
countries has a different agenda, this is what we have on the alien side
of things also. And he said if anything, it is more complex than the
human relations here on planet earth politically and otherwise.
But we did talk about
Zecharia Sitchin,
the Anunnaki, the conception of
the humanoid, very tall beings that are depicted on the temples and he
verified that those beings did indeed look like that or do. And he did
not seem certain as to whether people or beings like Enki or Enlil are
still alive and whether or not they would be returning at this time.
We did talk about
the return of Marduk. He
indicated that there is some possibility that there is some truth there,
but again that they don't run the earth. Maybe they want to be running
it, but they are not.
He did say that
the group in Sumer was Reptilian however, that they
looked Reptilian, and that they are related to the ones who are actually
running the Vatican at this time, which he did verify is a group of
Reptilians.
I talked about one of the significant areas that I had put out there
that I had tapped into on a psychic level, which had to do with Obama
during the so-called coronation or whatever they call it, of the new
Pope, who is indeed a Nazi, and therefore the Nazis have a relationship
even through DNA to the Reptilian factions.
He said that indeed when Obama went to pay
homage to Israel, that underground in Dimona is where the base of the
Anunnaki is, what we know of as these humanoid Anunnaki, from what I
understood. And that indeed Biden went to pay respects to the new Pope
as sort of a nod to that, but basically a statement by the United
States, in essence, saying that we are not going to necessarily bow down
to the Nazi contingent that is running the Vatican.
He did talk very specifically... we talked about some new information
that I had gotten recently having to do with the Chinese and where the
Chinese are at.
He agreed that the Chinese are dealing with
a new race of beings who are giving them new technology, and I've been
told that they want to, in essence, run the world, but he did not feel
that they are taking over the financial system, contrary to some reports
I was getting lately.
He does not feel that they are... he had not
heard that there was a contingent of Elders who had gone to try to make
a deal in Britain, basically sidelining
the Rothschilds and
the Bushes,
the Bush Cabal.
He said that the Chinese were not going to be running the financial
system from what he knows, and that they were barely making it. He said
that actually they are going to be hard-pressed in the next five years
to keep themselves going.
He thinks that they are going to have a
civil war, that the people, the Chinese people are actually in rebellion
against their leaders in China and that there is going to be a civil war
as the result.
I did ask him that if, as I felt,
the Secret Space Program is run for
the most part by the U.S. human's military, and he agreed that that was
for the most part the case.
But he did say that they had been very much
beleaguered financially by the problems that have been happening here on
planet Earth. And that money as the medium of exchange does seem to
interrupt or dampen their ability to do the kinds of things for the sake
of the Secret Space Program they would like to be doing, and it has
dampened some of their strength on a certain level.
Obviously the Secret Space Program is worked in connection with various
alien groups, and we talked about which groups are out there, which
groups are aligned positively with the humans, and which are not.
We talked about what is known as
the Galactic Federation. We also talked
about another group that is called the Collective, and we talked about,
as I said, the Reptilians and the Raptors.
So it seems to be divided
into those kind of groups in terms of factions, at least the ones you
can address without going into so much detail as to all the different
races beyond that.
And there are groups also that go interdimensionally. We didn't have
time to talk about all that, but apparently there are many different
kinds of gates here,
stargates on the planet, some of which are natural
stargates that involve vortices and some that you can use go to the Moon
and Mars.
He said the most easy thing to transport is
material items, more so than physical beings, but that you can
definitely take the gates, and that he and his father both took gates on
a regular basis between here and the Moon and Mars.
I asked him if it degraded, you know, if it was a problem physically to
take a gate because I remember that
Henry Deacon had talked about, and
complains of some of his health problems as the result of using the
gates, and he did say that that was one of the results.
Let's see, there's so much and I am going to try to grasp it as quickly
as I can. He talked about
Eisenhower meeting
just as it is in the public domain with the groups of aliens. We talked
about Nordics from Orion. I had a theory that not all the Nordics are so
friendly to our agenda but certainly there are some Nordics that are.
He did say that the Pleiadians and Nordics
are different races and that they look different. He said the one way
you could tell is that the Nordics actually have white blond hair and
some other different physicalities, but the Pleiadians have hair my
color (golden blond).
He said that he didn't know anything about
the
Billy Meier story. I asked him about that.
We talked about the AI (artificial intelligence). I asked him if there
was an AI running earth. He said that there is not. However, there is a
lot of danger from AI. It is one of our biggest so-called potential
enemies, are the various races that have AI. He also talked about the
humans that are now walking around that have been taken over by AI.
He talked about the fact that we are protected here on the planet Earth.
He said we were like [what] Israel is to the rest of the world, in a
sense that they have their protectors who keep them alive, but some of
their protectors are not necessarily their friends. It's like a tacit
peace in which they acknowledge that they can't just get rid of all the
human race, because they will bring war down upon themselves, so they
have a tacit truce, if you will, to allow humanity to be on the planet.
He said that if it wasn't for the fighting between the races that are
here and visiting, with various agendas, that humanity wouldn't have
lived this long on this planet, because there are a lot of them who
would like to do away with humanity altogether.
So it's like the
fighting, you know, the enemy of my enemy is my friend kind of thing.
He talked about why is there secrecy and the fact that all the races,
including the humans, are in complete agreement that the secrecy has to
continue because humanity is not ready to deal with the reality of the
ET presence. And that has nothing to do with what the various ET races
look like; we could handle what they look like. What we can't handle is
how they act, in other words the fact that they want to eat us.
There are a number of those races out there
that basically want to eat us for dinner, and so that mentality, of
going out and dealing with these races and knowing that any moment they
want to eat you, was something that humanity couldn't handle.
I asked him about the
Battle of LA. For example, there were kind of some
small antidotal things that I asked him, like details. I wanted to know
what race of beings were at the Battle of LA [and what they] had to do
with [it].
He said that the Japanese are dealing with various races of ETs, and
indeed various countries have various relationships with different
groups of ETs. So this further makes more of a complexity in the
international relations, as I've always known, although very few people
out there seem to realize that or deal with that.
In other words, we have governments. The governments do not act alone.
They act in concert with the various ET races that they have alignments
with and those agendas, whatever the agendas happen to be.
And he said that the Japanese were dealing with a couple different
races, and that they have been through the last four thousand years or
more.
We talked about the battle in the Pacific,
and
the underground bases of the various ETs there. He validated that.
He said the Navy is indeed at war with a group of Reptilians, and what
are in essence Reptilians with undersea bases in the Pacific Rim, and
that they have nuked a number of them.
They nuked an Island off of LA, which is
called something like LA Island, and that most people don't even know
that, and it is [only] 200 miles from LA.
He said nuclear power was really useless in space, completely antiquated
technology, that it really did no good, and it wasn't useful for
anything except occasionally here on earth to use as a weapon or in
space to basically, he said, shoot into an asteroid to then blow up a
passing ship that they want to destroy.
That is what he said is how it was used. But he said it was very crude,
a very crude method to even do that.
So in other words things like particle beam weapons and scalar weapons
were far in advance of the kinds of nuclear technology. But obviously
the nukes or nuclear technology are useful here on Earth to change the
environment into a high radiation environment so that we would in
essence mutate into having various powers that except... [cut away].
I didn't get a chance to ask him
about Phobos, which I wanted to, but I
talked to him about Solar Warden. He said Solar Warden is this inner
planet [group]. It's part of our solar system. It's a group of guardians
who are going around monitoring incoming and outgoing craft and races.
He does know something
about Ison and the
beams that are coming as part of Ison, and he is going to try to get
that information to me in as best a way he can. And, he clearly knows a
tremendous amount. It is just quite amazing. He just didn't even
hesitate.
He talked about the cutting edge of having technology as a race, and
being a space-faring race is all about having an ability to tap into
what he called a black star. And a black star can then become a black
hole; that's where they get their technology. There is a huge source of
power there that the races use to power the spacecraft and to use what
he called warp drive, to have the ability to warp-jump in that Star Trek
way.
He said that humans do have that technology, but only because they have
been given it or have stolen it by getting it from certain craft that
are drifting around out [in space].
In other words, the occupants are gone, but
this is a craft that has that technology. And they are still trying to
reverse engineer certain kinds of spacecraft that they use in concert
with the races that they are partners with, I guess, so to speak.
That is technology that gives them access to
the black star technology, but they don't own it for themselves yet, so
that is a big inhibiting factor to being able to rule space the way they
would like to, or have any kind of dominance out there without the help
of their alliances with these races.
Most Greys are clones. I kind of got off the
subject when I was talking about Dulce, but their one being who is
running Dulce was at least from a far off star system, and he is highly
intelligent and a different being than the Greys. I asked him if he was
a Zeta Reticuli. He seemed to think that he might have been from another
race altogether. And so this is the playing field.
He said the Rothschilds had less dominance than commonly thought,
although they do have a position in terms of the power structure. And
obviously, you know, the Bushes are players, etcetera.
He did say that you would not find a
documented record of the Bush family lineage DNA-wise anywhere, because
it contains Reptilian DNA. But, they are not shapeshifters, contrary to
what people think, but in their DNA is absolutely Reptilian DNA.
They
don't go to regular hospitals, and there is a reason for that. And the
Nazis the same thing, that there is a bloodline that has to do with the
Reptilian DNA that is in the Nazi line.
The two main Reptilian species that he was discussing, he said, don't
get along with each other so much. Each one considers the other lesser
than themselves, although they have the same agenda, but it's to
exclusion of each other. So again, that kind of animosity works for us
and the Raptors.
He has had a great deal of dealings with the Raptors it appears, from
not only having friends among the Raptor species, specific friends, to
having been discovered when he was a child in Marin County where there
was a crash of the spacecraft that was taken down by a group of incoming
Raptor craft.
Actually it was his wife, Jo Ann, who said
he had a scar from a blood brother relationship with the Raptors that
was made when he was a little child, a little baby in fact, right after
he was born.
He talked about the Raptors being able to speak English or any language
they wanted, but their vocal cords had to be slightly altered so that
they could communicate using voices like we do, and that they could then
communicate using our language.
But lots of the Raptors who are not on
the high levels of the military and the Raptor society don't have that
alteration, so they have to use things like sign signals. He said that
they are slightly telepathic but not all that telepathic.
I ask him if indeed he had some augmentation or abilities in that area,
and he seems to have that. He did allude to the fact that his
physicality being what it is, although he does have physical problems as
he is hitting 60 years old or more, that in his current capacity if he
didn't have that augmentation, he probably would not have survived 30
years of prison just physically.
So whatever that means, it sounds quite
interesting in what it really means in terms of his dealings with his
fellow inmates, so to speak.
Let's see, what else. I'm trying to think in terms of anything else I
can remember. I ask him where the gates were, you know, and I named De
Menwith Hill and Dimona, and he named another part of Israel that had a
gate.
He said there were gates in the mountain
ranges between Pakistan and Afghanistan and that [area] was riddled with
gates along there. And there are a number of gates, and I believe these
are natural
gates, between Iraq and Iran. And of course being that there
are battles over these gates, we make sure to try to have command of
them.
In essence, I mean if you were to sum up everything that he said, he was
basically talking about this kind of being... actually it sounds like a
mess here on earth. There are so many different agendas in operation for
these various races of ETs and there are so many of them and they are
all dealing with the various militaries, that it is really hard to
separate things out and talk about them. He said you can't make a
blanket statement for all one race anymore than you can for one country
so to speak.
Let's see, he talked about why he ended up in jail, why they framed him
particularly.
He said he had become disenchanted with his job in the
military. He is not aligned with the Nazi agenda and he is not happy
with the obvious experimentation that is going on by various races on
humanity. And that it also sounds like he didn't like
any kind of blanket murder of the ET races, even if they were our
enemies to some degree.
He had liaisons with Russian women, interpersonal relations, as well as
a head of French Intelligence, apparently a woman.
And those alliances, although he fed
information and reported on them regularly, etcetera, as an officer, he
said that that made him a threat in our military in such a way that they
became worried that he would become a whistleblower.
And so this is why they arranged to frame
him, that he was vocal about his disagreement with some of the agendas
that he was asked to be a part of and that this became more problematic.
His father, however, was more aligned with what you might call the
standard New World Order mission to some degree, at least throughout his
life because he was brought up with that perspective more so than Mark.
Let's see what else, I'm trying to think about any other areas that we
talked about, and I may have to just wait for my memory to come back in
certain things because I'm just trying to get everything. He said he had
had a lot of dealings with the Vatican, and I guess the races of
Reptilians under the Vatican.
Oh, he said John Paul, the death of John Paul I back in, I think it was
the '60s or '70s [1978], whenever he was killed, that that was a
killing. He just didn't die. He was killed, as many people have
suspected.
He said in 1979 the Vatican went through a drastic change,
and there was some kind of... it wasn't clear. I didn't get a clear
answer and wasn't able to really delve down into it too far because our
time was getting shorter and shorter.
But he said that in 1979 a lot of people don't realize it, but there was
a massive change. It sounded like it was earthwide, but it was also
specifically to do with the Vatican and a power struggle
within the
Vatican.
Well I talked about the financial system and again, you know, was it
true that the Chinese were actually going to be able to take it over,
and he said no, that he hadn't heard anything like that. He is tuned in
and has contacts on the outside. He is in communication regularly with
people who are on a high level.
I talked about being at the Bilderberg Event, you know the Fringe Event,
the demonstration where I spoke and so on, and he said that he has a
relationship with various members of
the Bilderbergs.
Let's see, what else? Oh he said the idea of shapeshifting, a lot like
you know what
David Icke talks about is really not very accurate. There
are very few races that ever have the ability to shapeshift, that it's
more, I guess, a DNA thing, a bloodline thing.
But that there are races, he said, that will
materialize here or they will use an android body that looks very human
and then they will manipulate it from a distance using an AI.
I think from what I understand
the Andromedans... first of all he said there were hundreds of races of
Andromedans, so, you know, you couldn't just couldn't call one group the
Andromedans, and that they all have different agendas. [0:49:10]
We talked about the Praying Mantis people as well. He said they had lost
power over the last 50 years, that group, but that they were initially
favorable toward humans, and now they may be more broken up. The Praying
Mantis people had some kind of civil war within their factions.
He said that initially the Praying Mantis
group was favorable to humans and were our allies, but that has changed
over time.
They are still, I guess, predominantly our
allies, although I think that there are breakups within their faction so
that you don't know who you are dealing with. And this is true, he said,
also within the Reptilian groups. The Greys definitely are at the beck
and call of the Reptilians he said.
He said that one of the reasons he is talking to me, or can talk to me
is that they know that because he is a prisoner, he's a felon - a
convicted felon, or whatever you call that - that nobody will believe
him. And so this is their way of feeding information out to the public
in one way.
But in the other way their plausible deniability is substantial because
if I say, as I am saying, all the things he said, people will not
believe the source, will not believe him because he has been in prison
for a murder charge, even if it is trumped up for the last 30 years.
So they feel safe in that way, but at the
same time they want to get information out, just as he said the movies
are being used for this purpose as well, movies and television, that
they are trying to wake humanity up to some degree. Although, you know,
they want to keep the lid on certain things.
He talked about crash retrievals. He was part of crash retrievals on a
regular basis. He said the United States is still going out around the
world paying off certain governments. For example, I mentioned South
Africa and various African countries where crashes are happening.
The U.S. Military or
Secret Space Program will go in right away, try to be the first ones
on the scene, and their job is to get that technology at whatever cost.
They will kill locals, or whatever they have to do in order to get that
technology. So that's their mission. That's what they are being told to
do, and he was part of some of those missions. So recovering technology
is still key.
I'm trying to think about anything else I might have asked him about.
I asked him about the black nano oil in
the
Falklands. He said he had heard about that but even though he was part
of the battle in the Falklands, he was not exposed directly to that so
he doesn't know anything much about it.
He is highly knowledgeable and he has flown many spacecraft,
interstellar types of craft, he, and his father. His father was, I
guess, a fighter pilot in World War II. In fact, he has a Nazi
bloodline. He has people that he was fighting, he and his father, or his
father was fighting against that are members of the Nazis, or were.
Oh, and I talked to him about the time travelers, actually the Nazi
technology
for time travel that in essence came out of the Bell, and
they have had that technology since the '40s. They do have a way to go
over to the other side, the parallel earth, bring back Nazis or even
other beings, you know, humans such as my whistleblower said.
I talked about this in my Time Travel
Conference from a whistleblower that I have. And he did say there are
many operations that involve time travel, and that [there are] many ways
in which they can bring, you know, back the human, in other words, make
them younger.
They are working on all these aspects of it so that he's met with Nazis
who are made younger in this way.
He himself has dealt with them so he
validated that information, which was fascinating, and said that you
can't always tell where the person who we knew in history, what means
they used to bring them back, whether they crossed over from what we
call the parallel earth, or whether it was this technique to reduce your
age, and then augment you, etcetera, and have you live a very long life.
He did there are many different ways that could be done, and so any
particular individual could have used a part of whatever program.
We talked
about Area 51 containing a gate. He said Los Alamos, just as
we thought, contains a gate and basically places in the Southwest of the
United States. As I said,
Menwith Hill, and
Dimona. He said Australia
was a very strong area, Outback of Australia. Oh, this is gone. I think
we are about to lose the battery.
I think the battery has gone out. Looks like
we are still broadcasting, but I'm not sure. Is that on?
Unidentified Person: Um hum.
KC: Is this on? Okay, he said that Australia, out in the desserts
of Australia, has a number of gates that people use and especially the
U.S. Military use.
He said there are things he can't tell me that absolutely have to do
with whether he would be killed or not and whether his family members
would be killed. So he has a select group of information that he can, I
guess, reply to, but there is also a very select group of information he
cannot acknowledge that he knows or talk about.
I think I'm running out of information at this point so we can stop and
I will try to think of some more. Okay, thank you.
[Later driving in car]
The prison outside looks like literally from the
Nazi era, but its bordered by these neighborhoods with kids, and I mean
people live right next door to the prison. It is unbelievable to me that
they would want to live there, but maybe they have to live there. I'm
not sure why.
But anyway the prison inside, when you go to meet with the
prisoners, is not anything like the movies, in this case at least. You
know it is not all lined up with tables and chairs where people sit
opposite each other and have conversations and can't touch and all this.
People are hugging each other and sitting next to each other really
close, couples and babies, and little children all running around.
There
are paintings on the wall, murals that the prisoners have made with
jungle scenes and animals, you know, it looks kind of like a playroom.
And it has little tables and chairs and everything is a little bit small
like it was borrowed from a school. Everyone is eating from vending
machines.
They have a microwave and they are making popcorn, so it is
not really an awful experience. That part is very human, you might say.
Although there are guards and everything, they don't get into your face.
They are not standing over you. I guess their high-powered cameras are
documenting everything they can hear you say, but we were able to talk
quite quietly, and there was a huge amount of noise because everyone is
talking at once to their spouses and all that kind of thing.
We were there for two hours or more. We were delayed because he said
that there was some kind of delay. He didn't know if it had to do with
them trying to delay him or not, but more delay than usual in bringing
him out to see us. And that was interesting.
You know, we basically had
to sit in these little chairs kind of hunched over talking to each
other, the three of us - me, Jo Ann his wife, and him. He ate a salad
from a vending machine that she got for him while he was talking to me.
I could have eaten something. I just drank water. Jo Ann made popcorn in
the microwave and ate it.
Let me see if there is anything I am thinking of. When I first got there
I described Camelot a little more to him. He seemed to know something
about Camelot. And I have to say, he definitely has his sources of
information, like people that he is getting his information from.
He
definitely talked about dear friends in the military and so on, and
actually Jo Ann told me that the guards are not able to - they try once
in a while to catch these people and get them in trouble and stuff - but
he's very... he's kind of like that Germanic strong no-nonsense kind of
guy.
He's not a joker. He is very intellectual, kind of an intellectual
physique, although you could see that he was probably stronger when he
was younger. He is still strong though. Looks strong. But he is
definitely sort of a no-nonsense kind of guy.
We weren't making jokes
and all that kind of thing. He is not like that at all.
He said the
guards tried to call him hunk or something, and because he is a Captain,
and maybe I guess a Major in the military, he insists on being treated
with respect by the guards. And he outranks them Jo Ann said, so they
are supposed to treat him with respect. And he insists upon it, and I'm
not sure what that manifests into or whatever.
She said that she feels protected, but that people have been following
her. They are often following her, she thinks, not to spy on her but to
protect her, because he insists upon it. Maybe it is part of his deal in
incarceration.
Their house gets broken into every single time she leaves it, like for a
trip to go to a speaking engagement, but the authorities, the military
is always in evidence of having snuck in; they try to cover their traces
but they don't do it very well.
So she is aware that they are always
going through her stuff. She talked about being on the Tour, I guess the
Glastonbury Tour, when she went to England to speak recently.
There was
a man dressed in black from head to toe standing there with a camera
looking very out of place, not fitting in, but basically there on the
job to watch her. I think he was not a good guy.
He said something intriguing to me when I was about to leave, that was
something about he could tell me more about Camelot. So I didn't know
what he was meaning about that, and I'm thinking that maybe he is
talking about King Arthur's Camelot or in the relationship, but I don't
really know what he is talking about exactly. Maybe even about this, or
my Project, I don't know.
In the meeting with Eisenhower off the airbase, I forget what it is
called, Muroc or whatever they call it, Edwards, he said there were
three groups of aliens.
One was called, he said one was called, I want
to say the Gargoyles, but that's not what he called them. He called them
something like the Ghouls, or something, that they have a name that
sounds kind of like... (Goblins) they make a joke about this race of
beings. They were there and, I guess, the Nordics and the Reptilians.
That's who was there.
There was one point when he said people should
be paying more attention to, you know, what I was talking about humanity
2.0 and their efforts in that direction... In essence he was saying that
people should put more energy toward that and less maybe toward outer
space, you know, the kind of cute little alien stories than they do,
because there is a lot going on, on planet Earth here I guess, where
they are really trying to manipulate the humans so to speak, and that is
something that needs to be investigated and paid more attention to.
I mean he definitely talked about going to
the Moon and
Mars like [it
was] a normal thing.
He also talked about going to
the moons, like moons
of
Titan, he named, and other moons. And he said that we are out in
space doing space mining, so to speak.
I wanted to know
about the gold. Because recently somebody was telling
me, Oh, you know the Chinese have more gold than anyone else.
Actually
that is not true according to him.
He says that we are bringing gold and
silver in from other planets, and that they come from all different
other planets, but we are not the only ones with gold and silver, and
that we are bringing gold and silver onto the planet. Obviously the
Secret Space uses that to basically be in charge of the world.
He also said that the whole idea of having an empire is the most common
configuration or model in space for a race to rule, that commandeering
resources and some form of money. He said there is always some form of
exchange regardless of what it might be with most other races.
He said that our Oort cloud of asteroids surrounding us makes us a very
difficult place to get to without using a gate, in other words, if you
want to fly here using spacecraft.
And that because of that, the Earth
was quite a protected zone in a certain way, that alien races had
trouble getting here using craft, and that they had to be quite advanced
to get here, like their space travel.
He said there was no second Sun. He said we might have been a binary
system a while ago, but that to his knowledge, and he has been out
there, he says to quote him, we do not have a second Sun. We only have
one Sun... and they have to be very careful about not igniting Jupiter
into a second sun, which is the same thing
Boriska said by the way.
That
validates Boriska's information.
He knows a lot about propulsion systems and I guess free energy and all
that. But he seemed to say that using that black star as a... oh, he
talked about black stars being a source of neutrinos, and that neutrinos
were the best source of fuel for getting around the solar system, and
again going warp.
He has flown all kinds of craft. He has flown experimental craft that
then became part of the Secret Space Program. He said that there is
distortion in the Star Trek version, that people tend to believe too
much of that. He did also refer to himself, however, as a Captain Kirk
character.
That, that in essence was his job, the same job as the one
Captain Kirk has, in other words, leading the space fleet.
I got the impression that both he and Jo Ann are having ongoing
relationships and communications with at least the Raptors, if not other
races as well.
He said he was placed in prison, he believes, by a certain group of
Reptilians in concert with some humans who don't like him and trust him.
I think maybe in essence the kind of Wolfowitz-Cheney contingent is
among those who are not his friends.
He talked about human women being extremely desirable to off-planet
races. Reptilians and Raptors can mate with human women and create
offspring who are then hybrid. They look human for the most part, but
that they have to be assisted, and I wasn't sure what he meant by that,
but they have to be assisted someway.
They consider it a big deal to be
with a human woman, and that lots of races, it sounded like he was
saying lots of races [felt that way]...[video fade]
He talked about
Göbekli Tepe, the new discovery in Turkey, and he said that that was
showing or had a very strong
connection to Sirius, the races from
Sirius, that they were dogs, he called them Canan-ites or Cannites
(something like that) and that they looked like dogs basically, standing
up on their hind feet, and that they had been dealing with [them] coming
here for eons.
He also talked about the cat people, the same thing.
He talked about
the Egyptians. He said that they were dealing with all
the different races coming here and that they were on a pretty
sophisticated level for the 2000 years that their civilization was in
operation, I think it was 2000 years.
He said he was involved with this Island called Saint George an island
down by the Falklands, I think it is down there. He said there is a
major, I guess, base of some kind going on there, and I think that might
be where the Raptors are as well.
He definitely was talking about wars taking place over the last 50 years
between all the different races, including happening here on earth, or
part of it.
He also said that various factions of the military, for
example, the Air Force has been dealing with, I think he said the
Raptors, for a super long time and therefore the Navy, if I have got
this right, doesn't trust them all that much. In other words the
different factions, because I was asking him, it has been known to
Camelot that the various divisions of the military don't necessarily
trust each other, and because they are aligned with different groups of ETs, and I asked him if he could verify that.
He did. That indeed is the
case.
[video fade]
He said that they definitely have undersea bases. He said that Catalina
was a base that was ours but it really belongs to an ET group, and that
we are the "security guards" he said for the Catalina base.
He stressed that various races really like our luxury items.
Specifically he then said you'd be surprised what a group of beings
would do for some chocolate, and he said that, and it almost sounded a
little sinister.
And along those lines he did say the earth is a very...
he didn't just say Earth, but he said our entire solar system is very
well positioned on the Milky Way Galaxy.
It's a very desirable location
apparently to other races. It is a highly contested area, and of course
Earth itself is, partly because of all the goodies - I think he even
called it goodies - it contained, presumably the humans being among one
of the goodies that he was talking about.
So he said, you know, that is
part of the issue.
He said his bloodline is the
Stewart family in England, but that he also
comes from a Scottish division of that group, and also has a very strong
German part of his bloodline that is linked to the Hapsburgs.
One of his
relatives is involved with one of the Hapsburg Princesses, and what that
does is validate the level he achieved in the military as well, because
obviously they are promoting those bloodlines.
The reason that you don't see these gigantic craft taking off from earth
to go out into space is because they can transport physical material
very easily through a gate, and so then they can use small craft to just
take, I guess, small teams out there. And so that's why there are not so
many big craft, or that they don't have to worry about hiding big craft.
And he said they could go as far as Moon and Mars. He said after that it
gets, what he called, dicey to try transporting things, meaning through
the gates. And that does coincide a bit with what Dan Burisch had said.
Dan Burisch had referenced early on the gates as being used to move
materials through and Dan Burisch said there was limitation. First of
all he said that humans couldn't go through the gate, which is not true.
I just remembered that he said he was part of
Project Moon Dust. He
called it Operation Moon Dust, and that was a crash retrieval program
for recovering technology, as we know, and which is documented out
there.
But the interesting thing about that is that I wrote a screenplay
years ago before Project Camelot and I named it Project Moon Dust,
because I had seen the name Moon Dust out there. It's just a
synchronicity.
He also talked about Robots. In other words that one of the biggest
threats we have is possible incoming races of Robots, obviously running
on an AI interface that would look humanoid. I guess like Battlestar
Galactica. He said that's a real possibility. But they may not look
humanoid; that's also a possibility.
And another big threat, he said,
was AI in general, that that was a big danger. And Nano, he said, that
was the other big danger to humanity is Nano. And he said he had direct
experience with that.
There were some things I wanted to remember that
he said
[Kerry shakes her head and voice drifts off
]
I can't remember
it will come to me

JULY 2014
CAPTAIN MARK RICHARDS II
MAIN NOTES: compilation of my recall
and Jo Ann Richard's notes in pencil during interview
note: these are notes only and not written in complete sentences with
punctuation etc.
NOTES TAKEN BY JO ANN RICHARDS
AND TRANSCRIPT FROM KERRY'S AUDIO NOTES
COMBINED INTO ONE DOCUMENT
Rough Draft notes
PENCIL ISSUE
They insisted that I know that this was weapon and Joann took notes
while I was talking to him.
I am struck by his presence of mind and his
generosity of spirit is such that he is willing to respond to any
question fully and completely. He focuses on you he's he's he's very
direct and he doesn't mince words he also doesn't suffer fools gladly.
I asked him several times to respond to
things that I have heard over the years out in the Alternative sector in
order to get his reaction and sometimes he would just unequivocally say
no this is not true and sometimes... he would say that something is
partially true and then exactly how it's true.
TIME TRAVEL/MISSIONS CURRENT - OUT OF BODY
OR IN ETHER
One the most significant questions that I asked him which he refused to
answer but in refusing to answer the answer was therefore clear - -I
asked him whether he felt he was still being utilized on missions.
Answered yes with body language
He was very very clear as always and I have to say that all my answers I
got all the answers to my questions and more and will to try to relate
here all the things that told so first of all I want to say that he also
shared with in prison for this as many years as he has been why he's
actually probably been able to survive it and that has a lot to train
because she is a very well-trained military guy
A captain inmate in the navy but he has since he was around three years
old been taught how to use gun and defend himself and join us published
many reports written by him and in part by her about his experiences
prior to his incarceration soon if you haven't already tried to get a
hold of those reports these to go to her website
I have a list pages long and I'm going to be giving this to him mailing
it to them because they wouldn't allow me to actually hand it to him and
so I mailed it to him, after the fact and then he will be able to also
put in writing anything that we don't cover- any questions I wasn't able
to get an answer to
As a captain in the Navy secret space program flying ships
interdimensional jumping he is very well aware of the multi-verse
He's not waiting for DISCLOSURE
***
There are between 1200 and 1500 inmates who should be released for good
behavior at Vacaville. They have been asked to find a way to release
them but they haven't done so.
This is called a political football. Mark Richards is one of those who
qualifies
VACAVILLE is a lower custody facility.
The kid who originally committed the murder Mark is accused and
sentenced over has gotten a high paid lawyer and gotten his sentence
overturned. However, they refuse to release him anyway
What does that tell you?
-
Raptors play both sides/factions.
Naga's daughter, is the Empress of the Raptors
-
See Harvest Moon '77 (one of the
reports for sale on Jo Ann Richard's website: Earth Defense
Headquarters - EDHCA.org)
-
TROGS - 7-9 foot tall cross between
Ant-like creatures and Praying Mantis
negative (service to
self) race
-
RAIDING PARTIES - humans are
abducted permanently off service Earth and have many uses to
visiting races
USES OF HUMANS:
-
FOOD SOURCE FOR REPS AND GRAYS
(MAYBE OTHERS)
-
ALLIES
-
SLAVES FOR BUILDING THINGS, SERVING
VARIOUS RACES
-
TRADING/BARTERING
-
STUDY - AS IN SCIENTIFIC STUDY
-
EARTH IS DESIRABLE VACATION SPOT
-
ACCESS TO MINERALS AND PRECIOUS
STONES
-
TOP SIDE USE OF LAND/UNDERGROUND
BASES - JUMPING OFF POINT TO OTHER SYSTEMS
-
BREEDING AND GENETIC PROGRAMS WITH
HUMAN FEMALES HIGHLY DESIRABLE
***
1. BLACK STAR - DARK STAR ENERGY - from used
to power space craft.
This type of energy is highly prized in the
multi-verse. It puts humans on the level with other interstellar races.
They don't appreciate that.
-
- Different than zero point energy
-
Gotten from recently exploded
neutron stars
-
Most of science doesn't understand
dark energy
-
Allows our space command to go
interstellar and avoid jumping through black holes
-
Technically, we could make it at
CERN but it is both small and expense
-
The best way to snag it is with the
help of various friendly races who help us navigate jumping
(going back in time, to acquire it
Because we still don't have
complete control of where we jump to
You can jump too close to
a system's sun or star
Once you get caught in the gravitic pull
of a body, you may not be able to escape
3 ways to get Dark Energy
-
Snag it by jumping back in time with
navigation help from another race. Snag it through gate.
-
Trade it by giving them a large
number of humans. (darkest way)
-
Barter - such as we did with the
Canonians (Dog race of beings)
exchange for giving them an
underground base on Earth (in Australia).
CANONIANS
According to Mark the Canonians like humans.
Often dress in hoods and go into malls etc
to watch humans and have fun. Consider Earth good jumping off point to
other systems. Merchant race of the galaxy. Can't wait for disclosure so
they can market to us. Needed a safe place for their underground base.
Consider Earth safe for them. They stand upright humanoid - their faces
are like hound dogs.
SPACE COMMAND have done a deal with them and HAS BUILT THEM A BASE
underground in Australia
and in exchange for that they were given dark energy to go inter
dimensional and travel far distances.
They sometimes go out IN appropriate weather with rain coats and
cover their faces and go out among the public because they just enjoy,
SIMILAR TO
THE TALL WHITES AS REPORTED BY CHARLES HALL.
VARIOUS factions of the military and governments ALIGNED WITH VARIOUS
INTERSTELLAR RACES are worth each other but each of the sessions is
aligned with at least one and sometimes more than one race that those
who serve and we're really dealing with what is in essence Exopolitics situation is
all of these races are vying for power
.
He said earth is extremely desirable because of its various systems and
not the least of which is also our society.
He doesn't want to violate security but he did say that earths females
are highly desirable to many off planet races
they use HUMANS FOR
various purposes. He didn't elaborate much on this.
2. MARK'S PSYCHIC ABILITIES
-
He knew
Pat Price - he verified he
died via remote viewing. Pat Price was the CIA equivalent of
what Mark did for the USAF
-
Pat Price was getting ready to come
forward in 1975-76, was murdered.
-
Mark started working for Lockheed at
16. Was heavily tested for psychic and other abilities, and
found that because of his childhood (in part) that he didn't
have limitations most children have. Was able to achieve things
most kids can't
partially due to his father and mother and
growing up with a father in the secret space program/ space
command. Father was known as the DUTCHMAN. He was frequently
introduced to many people in high places military and others
that he doesn't remember
-
Asked about Kill shot from the sun -
said it's gov BS
there is no doom/gloom scenario that we don't
manage to get around for the next several centuries that he is
aware of
-
ETs both positive and negative have
vested interest in seeing Earth remain and humans as well (in
case of positive/related ET groups)
-
Alien or human illuminati could do
an EMP to slow us down.
-
Doesn't think the NWO agenda would
allow for this Earth to destroy their means to acquire more
wealth and power. They sell to the middle class.
-
There are "no fracture lines in our
mobius that suggest world destruction"
-
Pole shift concept
could happen but
not man-made
Believes gov groups /factions are trying to figure
out how to avoid it rather than create it.
-
Humans have enemies that threaten
us
several races.
3. BLACK OIL - GOO - yes was introduced by
alien source probably reptilians. Can take over humans... artificial
intelligence but more like mushrooms or fungus... You are not going to
have a conversation with it anytime soon
Still a factor to deal
with
Has no agenda of its own. Several species have this sort of
technology. Our military is still fighting it
but it's more stabilized.
4. We have an off planet group of
PEACEKEEPERS/WATCHDOGS willing to defend Humans and Earth
5. The Confederation of races - such as
Ashtar Command - have been enemies at times and other times work with us
on some things. They have an agenda
***
6. MT. SHASTA - Lemurian base has been there
15-16,000 years
has gone through several changes and challenges.
Raptors were there in mid 70's until about 1981-82.
They pulled out
after the Falklands war
due to angst from other races who felt they
were not to be trusted because too aligned with certain humans (NAVY?)
and possibly Air Force as well.
7. NAZI'S IN US GOV - doesn't seem to
believe they are in control of US. gov.
Thinks Bushes aren't Nazis (just
helped them because it made monetary and strategic sense) but they are
FASCISTS. The elected government not Nazis however the Rich Nazis do run major
corporations
and therefore run US. through them to some degree.
Nazis believe in totalitarian government
in favor of human slavery,
social purity. Got help from Aldebaran and Reptoids and probably TROGS.
8. Says AFRICA - they have big plans for
Africa and none of them good. Something is going on in Nigeria and the
Congo
did not deny that we sold large portions of Africa to incoming
race from Aldebaran (need to get more about this
)
Says both CONGO and
SOUTH AFRICA seen as important in the future
Mining of colored
DIAMONDS - several alien species find COLORED DIAMONDS (not clear ones)
very desirable.
7. CATS - panther type; introduced concept
of Cat goddess to Egypt and Mesopotamia
by Cat people.
8.
VESTA - asteroid... there is a base in
the asteroid with human and Nordic species.
9.. ORION SHIPS
- Ships from Orion System - built by
Nordics (and other races?) have been sold to humans
- SPACE FLEET - belonging to and built by humans called ORION SHIPS
deep space fleet
- (12 built in the '50s)
upgraded since then. Mark was a Captain of
an Orion ship.
- we have an interchange program with aliens to learn about space
travel and navigation.
10. Verified that we have capability (as
stated by Jake Simpson) to identify who is flying and incoming craft,
type of craft etc from a distance of those flying into our solar system.
SOLAR WARDEN.. space fleet. But we are not as fast at that as we need to
be.
11. MINERVA - biological entity - SPACE SHIP
- one of a kind in our solar system but she is in touch with others of
her kind out there. She is 40,000 years more advanced than our tech.
- humans irritate her like fleas
- liked Mark and did mind meld so he could fly her using his
abilities to interface with her
12. WHY DOESN'T MARK SIMPLY LEAVE?
-has offers from Raptors (to go to other
planets) etc. but doesn't want to leave friend and family
- yes they could break him out of prison at any time
- if he was broken out he would have to leave because he would be
hunted by enemies (Reps and some humans)
- he does have protection and is very able to protect himself as
well.
- loves this planet - says its the best Earth like planet out of
1700 others for human life
13. TERRAFORMING MOONS OF JUPITER & SATURN -
he says no
but we do have BASES THERE
AND we have terraformed a couple
of moons containing large numbers of humans (hundreds of thousands of
humans) rescued from RAIDING PARTIES by the Raptors.
They can't bring
them back here because they know at least some of the humans would talk
and they can't have that.
Note: indications that we have more enemies that we know
and that
Humans are more desirable either as food and for breeding (genetic
programs with human females) than we realize.
- our
terraforming attempts have been less than successful because it is
hard to get Earth plants and bacteria to grow in alien soil
14. MARS
- Everything is underground.
15. MISC. RAPTORS - look like Steven
Spielberg Jurassic park - 4 ft tall - hunched over on very large
legs/thighs but if stretched out are about 8 feet tall.
- Anything they do to help humans can be used against them by Reptoids
and Trogs..
- Raptors Empress viewed
mobius of future timelines and the ones where
they align themselves with humans are the most positive for their race.
So they are now dedicated to working with humans (not eating them).
- Raptors were eating humans until a TREATY in 1954.
- CHINA GATE - WAR - a group of Raptors disagreed with the Empress and
worked with Nazis/Reptoids against humans.
16. CRYSTALLINE BEINGS BLOB-LIKE - CALLED
"JOTUNS" - spies of the multi-verse
used by other races because they
can morph to take on almost any shape (couch, human) and are
indistinguishable from the real thing)
but can' only take shapes approx
to their own real size. Not friendly to humans.
17.
NEW BERLIN:
- Build and run by Nazis
- Raptors and humans are there now as well.
- Some small groups of ambassadors from other races including the BLUE
GREYS who are friendly to humans.
- Mark admits to working with Nazis when necessary to his mission.
18. ROTHSCHILDS - Mark has a problem with
most Rothschilds but one
doesn't believe they are necessarily
Satanists.
19.
BECHTELS - are WAY WORSE THAN
ROTHSCHILDS
running behind the scenes a part of secret space program.
20. Says DNA tests of Western Elite families
does not contain reptilian stain
Says humans have horrible tendencies not connected to the alien races
21. We can trace HUMAN DNA all the way
back.. much further than commonly known.
22.
PLEIADIANS contributed DNA to
humans -
were the first humans
but left and have not contributed anything to
help our DNA progress lately
23.
CHEMTRAILS - yes being used to poison
humans
terraform planet/contain nano and create Humanity 3.0 =
looking for a more SUGGESTIBLE, (DOCILE) CONTROLLABLE, BUT SUPER SOLDIER
TYPE OF HUMAN.
24. Some parts of TREATIES WITH ALIENS have
given away our rights.
25. Doesn't believe AUTISM (created by
radiation exposure of parents) is being used to create pre-cogs. (note I
disagree strongly with this based on much investigation).
26. Says we have lowered out standards of
excellence in the military
27. Mark considers that he has made a
COMMAND DECISION TO COME FORWARD... as an OFFICER OF THE MILITARY
28.
TIME TRAVEL - he travels without
stargaze or wormhole - using basically the merkaba
light body in
motion
Only question he would not answer was about him being sent on
CURRENT ASSIGNMENTS in ether etc.
But in body language conveyed clearly
this is the case.
- PARALLEL EARTH - very dangerous to go and find your doppleganger
(double)
; warns must not touch them
would be very difficult.
- NAZIS - TIME TRAVEL & REVERSE AGING
they made great strides in
longevity and reducing aging
verified my time traveler story (spoken
about on stage at my Awake & Aware Time Travel conference
) yes 1000s of
Nazi officers and scientists have been reduce aged
at innocuous jobs.
And working on the space program in secret. Easiest place to hide is
GERMANY. (Hiding in plain site)
Since 1982 (?) easier for reduce-aged to
blend back into society
.
- WERNER VON BRAUN AND DISNEY were some of 1st men to be CLONED.
- AVATAR SCENARIO EASY TO ACHIEVE - using your own DNA
- Our mind is BASED on our DNA
29. EARTH - BIG VACATION SPOT/OBSERVATION
SPOT FOR VISITING SPECIES
they may sometimes fear us
Big "alien
tourist industry"
30. PORTALS/STARGATES - BEINGNESS OF
PLANETS ETC
- Saturn and Jupiter have large portals into other dimensions
- there is a species of gaseous creature that visits Mark and others
looks like grayish cloud
-
they can survive here
- says anything that develops a multi-genetic code is Alive
- there is no ruling body that controls Earth from Saturn
- Saturn is considered a goddess being and worshipped or revered by
several ET races
Back in 1961 and 71 we had interplanetary meetings but
humans back then didn't understand what being "alive" was
Story about
aliens refusing to meet without Goddess Saturn present
Jupiter also
individual living being...
31. ALL WORLDS ARE YOURS EXCEPT FOR
EUROPA
- says race of Worms inhabit it and want to develop their race there so
it is off limits to other beings to occupy however there are
installations (we have one) and 16 robotic bases there. (note: I remote
viewed this as well...)
32. We have been attacked by ADVANCED AI
SPECIES
robots/androids more
33. GOLD - not the same energetically as
that found off planet... why? Doesn't have same pollution levels as
Earth gold... nor same long term pressures
- used in space travel as directional locator
- doesn't know about inter dimensional qualities but acknowledges
possible
- We could slide Earth slightly off-kilter but it is dangerous
34. WHY HE TALKS - believes his info is
dated and built in deniability by gov due to imprisonment etc.
35. WAR IN MIDDLE EAST - about guarding
stargates with Raptors help - NUMEROUS GATES ALONG RANGE OF MOUNTAINS
BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ
but they are shifting constantly floating up and
down
making guarding them more and more difficult.
36. WARS - POLITICS - INTERSTELLAR RACE
INVOLVEMENT.
There is evidence of ALIEN VISITATION some buried such as IN GOBI
DESERT
IN MALTA
- Carved mural near Persepolis
- Iran - we are battling them since 1979 (up until then they were
"fine") but since then taken over by Reptoids and "Jinn"
- Their Imams are being deceived and turned against us by Reptoids
- Certain races of OCEANICS advise our Navy
- Raptors CLOSEST to USAF
- Russians are more aligned with Reptoids
- Our animosity toward Russians goes back many years due to different
human conditions creating us as a different type of humanity
- Russians more hardy due to strenuous conditions/ life style/and
meaner as a result.
- Chinese are aligned with RACE OF HAIRY HUMANOIDS/AND ZETAS
He knows
of 3 other races interacting with Chinese but does not know of any new
technological advantage.. (this came from a whistleblower who claims the
Chinese were recently given an new tech no one else has to give them the
advantage so they can "rule the world"
)
- URAL MTN BASES - There are new Russian bases in the Ural Mountains
affecting US-Russian relations
37. PUTIN AND UKRAINE
- Putin wanted Crimea for reasons
pertaining to bizarre MAGNETIC
anomalies in that country... tanks and troops disappearing in thin air -
many such occurrences
(my comment: The very uneven energy in Crimea and
Putin's desire to get control of Crimea may be in part because of the
pyramids found there).
- Putin knows all secrets
not the good guy he pretends to be - however
very smart and comes across better because far more read in on truth
than Obama and other Western politicians.
38.
MALTA - SOME OF RUINS NOT OF THIS PLANET
- TEMPLES built by other races
- vortexes there are controlled by
Vatican and
Knights of Malta etc.
- yes one of the powerhouses on Earth
- Mark was thinking of writing a book on Malta, loves it but they killed
an important and powerful friend of his there
-
Mnajdra and other temple built by Raptors... see their size and size of
doors
not by Longheads.
-
Ggantija was major GALACTIC SPACE CENTER where many races
from Multiverse would meet also containing SPACE PORT LIKE ZEPTEPI
IN
SOUTHERN TURKEY. Big alien tourist spot.
- Vatican using Knights of Malta to hide MANY SECRETS on Malta re
Atlantis and more.
39.
ATLANTIS
- MALTA was a safe haven
but Atlantis likely was (according to
Pleiadians). North American continent - back in those days just around
1000 miles off Portugal
MALTA RE the information that I've been getting
go there to bring a group to investigate is right on.
- ATLANTIS - There is evidence of Atlantis off the coast of Gibraltar
and undersea substantial things have been found there GOBI desert AND
other places as well. THE PLEIADIANS SAY that our earth was smaller
AND
HAS expanded so that got me days of Atlantis is very likely that he
believes United States was a lot closer and U.S. may actually be
Atlantis.
- MALTA he agrees was a sanctuary
40. Re TOWER ON THE MOON FOR SOULS?
REINCARNATION?
- says NO
there are many towers on the Moon but nothing to do with
Reincarnation!
41. BUSH branch of NWO - cabal - forced to
pull back since 2008
due to mismanagement
42. Mark is a deep believer in the DREAM OF
The United
Nations
- says there are at least 2 main meeting places on Earth today for
interstellar races
one in Britain and one in Chile. The one in Chile is
often attacked by Earthquake weapons from the reps
it is in Southern
Chile.
- one old one in UK was in a well known castle... Major meeting place.
Now changed to Space Command Center in Leiscester
not as much for
meetings but still a lot more going on there than public realizes
43. Secret Space Program RUN PRIMARILY BY US
& RUSSIA along with UK & FRANCE.
44. MARK's STATE OF MIND AND HOW HE SURVIVES
PRISON
45, RAIDING PARTIES
TAKING HUMANS
WOMEN
AND CHILDREN MAINLY
OFF PLANET TERRAFORMED A COUPLE MOONS OUTSIDE OUR
SOLAR SYSTEM
HIDDEN
WILL NOT REVEAL WHERE
large numbers of humans on that were recaptured
by the raptors and rescued
taken to the terraformed Moons - hundreds of
thousands - the reason they can't bring them back to earth is because
that at least some of those people would end up talking and Mark said
that they couldn't allow that because that would reveal the whole
secret
46. We have PEACEKEEPERS - WATCH FORCE that
patrols or galaxy maintained by our various allies. There's a group that
is dedicated to keeping people peace in the solar system and that they
there are there are similar to our United Nations with your different
group and I try to broker peace between various rival beings and
Factions.
47. NORM BERGRUN - RINGS OF SATURN - DIDN'T
know about SHIPS in Rings of Saturn per Norm Bergrum. Doesn't think
there is a Control group from Saturn over Earth. He did say some major
portal into the multi-verse from Saturn and Jupiter as well.
48.
TERRAFORMING he said that the earth is
very very hard for us to TERRAFORM that people don't understand the
difficulty there has a lot to do with the fact that we had trouble
getting bacteria to grow in an alien environment. Therefore it's very
hard to get plants take root
so they use hydroponics in an enclosed
structure. 17,000 (or 1700??) Earthlike planets but none of them are as
conducive to human human life as our Earth.
49.
STARGATES - Earth's star gates - he said
you can create a portal any where. Humans can create a portal which to
go that we have the capability. And then there are the ones that are
being fought over and there's a range of mountains between IRAN AND IRAQ
where the gates are shifting
for the gates don't stay in place and
therefore they're very hard to guard and and and so on.
50. ET's that are investing in movies make the most money and that that money is all going into the
black
projects. There is a paper trail that Hollywood has that would prove
this
but it is hidden. George Lucas and James Cameron are very well
versed in what is going on here on planet earth and know the Raptors are
investing in their movies
.
MORE movies coming about DRAGONS... for PR purposes by Raptors
to improve
Human-Raptor relations!
51. HUMANS AS A COMMODITY - needs more
investigation
Humans are a commodity in
the multiverse that they sometimes used to
trade for what we (the Secret Space program) really wants like whether
it's
dark energy or something else.
However, there is also a protection for the humans, but there's a lot
less of that going on because of the NEW TREATIES that have been made as
of this sort of protection.
