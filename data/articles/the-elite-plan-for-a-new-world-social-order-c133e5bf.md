When the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, in the late 1700s, there
was lots of money to be made by investing in factories and mills, by opening
up new markets, and by gaining control of sources of raw materials.
The
folks who had the most money to invest, however, were not so much in Britain
but more in Holland. Holland had been the leading Western power in the
1600s, and its bankers were the leading capitalists. In pursuit of profit,
Dutch capital flowed to the British stock market, and thus the Dutch funded
the rise of Britain, who subsequently eclipsed Holland both economically and
geopolitically.
In this way British industrialism came to be dominated by wealthy investors,
and capitalism became the dominant economic system. This led to a major
social transformation. Britain had been essentially an aristocratic society,
dominated by landholding families. As capitalism became dominant
economically, capitalists became dominant politically.
Tax structures and
import-export policies were gradually changed to favor investors over
landowners.
It was no longer economically viable to simply maintain an estate in the
countryside: one needed to develop it, turn it to more productive use.
Victorian dramas are filled with stories of aristocratic families who fall
on hard times, and are forced to sell off their properties. For dramatic
purposes, this decline is typically attributed to a failure in some
character, a weak eldest son perhaps. But in fact the decline of aristocracy
was part of a larger social transformation brought on by the rise of
capitalism.
The business of the capitalist is the management of capital, and this
management is generally handled through the mediation of banks and brokerage
houses.
It should not be surprising that investment bankers came to occupy
the top of the hierarchy of capitalist wealth and power. And in fact, there
are a handful of banking families, including
the Rothschilds and
the
Rockefellers, who have come to dominate economic and political affairs in
the Western world.
Unlike aristocrats, capitalists are not tied to a place, or to the
maintenance of a place. Capital is disloyal and mobile - it flows to where
the most growth can be found, as it flowed from Holland to Britain, then
from Britain to the USA, and most recently from everywhere to China. Just as
a copper mine might be exploited and then abandoned, so under capitalism a
whole nation can be exploited and then abandoned, as we see in the rusting
industrial areas of America and Britain.
This detachment from place leads to a different kind of geopolitics under
capitalism, as compared to aristocracy. A king goes to war when he sees an
advantage to his nation in doing so. Historians can explain the wars of
pre-capitalist days, in terms of the aggrandisement of monarchs and nations.
A capitalist stirs up a war in order to make profits, and in fact our elite
banking families have financed both sides of most military conflicts since
at least World War 1.
Hence historians have a hard time explaining World
War 1 in terms of national motivations and objectives.
In pre-capitalist days warfare was like chess, each side trying to win.
Under capitalism warfare is more like a casino, where the players battle it
out as long as they can get credit for more chips, and the real winner
always turns out to be the house - the bankers who finance the war and
decide who will be the last man standing.
Not only are wars the most
profitable of all capitalist ventures, but by choosing the winners, and
managing the reconstruction, the elite banking families are able, over time,
to tune the geopolitical configuration to suit their own interests.
Nations and populations are but pawns in their games. Millions die in wars,
infrastructures are destroyed, and while the world mourns, the bankers are
counting their winnings and making plans for their postwar reconstruction
investments.
From their position of power, as the financiers of governments, the banking
elite have over time perfected their methods of control. Staying always
behind the scenes, they pull the strings controlling the media, the
political parties, the intelligence agencies, the stock markets, and the
offices of government.
And perhaps their greatest lever of power is their
control over currencies. By means of their central-bank scam, they engineer
boom and bust cycles, and they print money from nothing and then loan it at
interest to governments.
The power of the elite banking gang (the banksters)
is both absolute and subtle
Some of the biggest men in the United States are afraid of something. They
know there is a power somewhere, so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so
interlocked, so complete, so pervasive that they had better not speak above
their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.
- President Woodrow Wilson
The End of Growth - Banksters vs. Capitalism
It was always inevitable, on a finite planet, that there would be a limit to
economic growth.
Industrialization has enabled us to rush headlong toward
that limit over the past two centuries. Production has become ever more
efficient, markets have become ever more global, and finally the paradigm of
perpetual growth has reached the point of diminishing returns.
Indeed, that point was actually reached by about 1970. Since then capital
has not so much sought growth through increased production, but rather by
extracting greater returns from relatively flat production levels. Hence
globalization, which moved production to low-waged areas, providing greater
profit margins. Hence privatization, which transfers revenue streams to
investors that formerly went to national treasuries.
Hence derivative and
currency markets, which create the electronic illusion of economic growth,
without actually producing anything in the real world.
For almost forty years, the capitalist system was kept going by these
various mechanisms, none of which were productive in any real sense. And
then in September 2008 this house of cards collapsed, all of a sudden,
bringing the global financial system to its knees.
If one studies the collapse of civilizations, one learns that
failure-to-adapt is fatal. Is our civilization falling into that trap? We
had two centuries of real growth, where the growth-dynamic of capitalism was
in harmony with the reality of industrial growth. Then we had four decades
of artificial growth - capitalism being sustained by a house of cards.
And
now, after the house of cards has collapsed, every effort is apparently
being made to bring about a recovery - of growth! It is very easy to get
the impression that our civilization is in the process of collapse, based on
the failure-to-adapt principle.
Such an impression would be partly right and partly wrong. In order to
understand the real situation we need to make a clear distinction between
the capitalist elite and capitalism itself. Capitalism is an economic system
driven by growth; the capitalist elite are the folks who have managed to
gain control of the Western world while capitalism has operated over the
past two centuries.
The capitalist system is past its sell-by date, the bankster elite are well aware of that fact
- and they are adapting.
Capitalism is a vehicle that helped bring the banksters to absolute power,
but they have no more loyalty to that system than they have to place, or to
anything or anyone. As mentioned earlier, they think on a global scale, with
nations and populations as pawns.
They define what money is and they issue
it, just like the banker in a game of Monopoly. They can also make up a new
game with a new kind of money. They have long outgrown any need to rely on
any particular economic system in order to maintain their power. Capitalism
was handy in an era of rapid growth.
For an era of non-growth, a different
game is being prepared.
Thus, capitalism was not allowed to die a natural death. Instead it was
brought down by a controlled demolition. First it was put on a life-support
system, as mentioned above, with globalization, privatization, currency
markets, etc. Then it was injected with a euthanasia death-drug, in the form
of real-estate bubbles and toxic derivatives.
Finally, the Bank of
International Settlements in Basel - the central bank of central banks - pulled the plug on the life-support system: they declared the
mark-to-market rule, which made all the risk-holding banks instantly
insolvent, although it took a while for this to become apparent.
Every step
in this process was carefully planned and managed by the central-banking
clique.
The End of Sovereignty
- Restoring the Ancien Régime
Just as the financial collapse was carefully managed, so was the
post-collapse scenario, with its suicidal bailout programs.
National budgets
were already stretched; they certainly did not have reserves available to
salvage the insolvent banks. Thus the bailout commitments amounted to
nothing more than the taking on of astronomical new debts by governments. In
order to service the bailout commitments, the money would need to be
borrowed from the same financial system that was being bailed out!
Its not that the banks were too big to fail, rather the banksters were too
powerful to fail: they made politicians an offer they couldnt refuse. In
the USA, Congress was told that without bailouts there would be martial law
the next morning. In Ireland, the Ministers were told there would be
financial chaos and rioting in the streets.
In fact, as Iceland
demonstrated, the sensible way to deal with the insolvent banks was with an
orderly process of receivership.
The effect of the coerced bailouts was to transfer insolvency from the banks
to the national treasuries. Banking debts were transformed into sovereign
debts and budget deficits. Now, quite predictably, it is the nations that
are seeking bailouts, and those bailouts come with conditions attached.
Instead of the banks going into receivership, the nations are going into
receivership.
In his book,
Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, John Perkins explains how
the third world has been coerced over the past several decades - through
pressure and trickery of various kinds - into perpetual debt bondage.
By
design, the debts can never be repaid. Instead, the debts must be
periodically refinanced, and each round of refinancing buries the nation
deeper in debt - and compels the nation to submit to even more drastic IMF
diktats.
With the orchestrated financial collapse, and the too big to fail
scam, the banksters have now crossed the Rubicon:
the hit-man agenda is now
operating here in the first world.
In the EU, the first round of nations to go down will be the so-called PIIGS:
-
Portugal
-
Ireland
-
Italy
-
Greece
-
Spain
The fiction, that the PIIGS can deal
with the bailouts, is based on the assumption that the era of limitless
growth will resume. As the banksters themselves know full well, that just
isnt going to happen. Eventually the PIIGS will be forced to default, and
then the rest of the EU will go down as well, all part of a
controlled-demolition project.
When a nation succumbs to debt bondage, it ceases to be a sovereign nation,
governed by some kind of internal political process. Instead it comes under
the control of IMF diktats. As we have seen in the third world, and is
happening now in Europe, these diktats are all about austerity and
privatization.
Government functions are eliminated or
privatized, and
national assets are sold off. Little by little - again a controlled
demolition - the nation state is dismantled. In the end, the primary
functions left to government are police suppression of its own population,
and the collection of taxes to be handed over to the banksters.
In fact, the dismantling of the nation state began long before the financial
collapse of 2008. In the USA and Britain, it began in 1980, with Reagan and
Thatcher. In Europe, it began in 1988, with the Maastricht Treaty.
Globalization accelerated the dismantling process, with the exporting of
jobs and industry, privatization programs, free trade agreements, and the
establishment of the regulation-busting World Trade Organization (WTO).
Events since 2008 have enabled the rapid acceleration of a process that was
already well underway.
With the collapse, the bailouts, and the total failure to pursue any kind of
effective recovery program, the signals are very clear: the system will be
allowed to collapse totally, thus clearing the ground for a pre-architected
solution. As the nation state is being dismantled, a new regime of global
governance is being established to replace it.
As we can see with the WTO,
IMF, World Bank, and the other pieces of the embryonic world government, the
new global system will make no pretensions about popular representation or
democratic process.
Rule will be by means of autocratic global
bureaucracies, which will take their orders, directly or indirectly, from
the bankster clique.
In his book, The Globalization of Poverty, Michel Chossudovsky explains how
globalization, and the actions of
the IMF, created massive poverty
throughout the third world over the past several decades. As we can see,
with the dramatic emphasis on austerity following the collapse and bailouts,
this poverty-creation project has now crossed the Rubicon. In this new world
system there will be no prosperous middle class.
Indeed, the new regime will
very much resemble the old days of royalty and serfdom (the ancien régime).
The banksters are the new 'royal family,' with the whole world as their
dominion. The technocrats who run the global bureaucracies, and the
mandarins who pose as politicians in the residual nations, are the
privileged upper class.
The rest of us, the overwhelming majority, will find
ourselves in the role of impoverished serfs - if we are lucky enough to be
one of the survivors of the collapse process.
Today Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to
restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful.
This is especially true if
they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or
promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples
of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil.
The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this
scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee
of their well being granted to them by their world government.

The End of Liberty - The Global Police State
For the past four decades, since about 1970, weve been experiencing a
regime-change process, from an old global system to a new global system.
In
the old system, first world nations were relatively democratic and
prosperous, while the third world suffered under police state tyranny, mass
poverty, and imperialism (exploitation by external powers).
As discussed
above, the transition process has been characterized by crossing the
Rubicon - the introduction of policies and practices into the first world,
that were formerly limited, for the most part, to the third world.
Thus debt bondage to the IMF
crossed the Rubicon, enabled by the
collapse-bailout scam.
In turn, mass poverty is crossing that same Rubicon,
due to austerity measures imposed by the IMF, with its new bond-holding
powers. Imperialism is also crossing the Rubicon, as the first world comes
under the exploitative control of banksters and their bureaucracies, a power
nexus that is external to all national identities.
Unsurprisingly, police
state tyranny is also crossing the Rubicon:
the imposition of third world
poverty levels requires third world methods of repression.
The anti-globalization movement can be taken as the beginning of popular
resistance to the process of regime change.
Similarly, the police response
to the Seattle anti-globalization demonstrations, in November 1999, can be
taken as the crossing of the Rubicon for police state tyranny. The
excessive and arbitrary violence of that response - including such things as
holding peoples eyes open and spraying pepper into them - was unprecedented
against non-violent demonstrators in a first world nation.
Ironically, that police response, particularly as it was so widely
publicized, actually strengthened the anti-globalization movement.
As
demonstrations grew in size and strength, the police response grew still
more violent. A
climax of sorts was reached in Genoa, in July 2001, when the
levels of violence on both sides began to resemble almost a guerilla war.
In those days the anti-globalization movement was dominating the
international news pages, and opposition to globalization was reaching
massive proportions. The visible movement was only the tip of an
anti-systemic iceberg. In a very real sense, general popular sentiment in
the first world was beginning to take a radical turn.
Movement leaders were
now thinking in terms of an anti-capitalist movement. There was a political
volatility in the air, a sense that, just maybe possibly, enlightened
popular sentiment might succeed in shifting the course of events.
All of that changed on
September 11, 2001, the day the towers came down. The
anti-globalization movement, along with globalization itself, disappeared
almost totally from public consciousness on that fateful day. Suddenly it
was a whole new global scenario, a whole new media circus - with a new
enemy, and a new kind of war, a war without end, a war against phantoms, a
war against terrorism.
Earlier we saw how the orchestrated financial collapse of September 2008
enabled certain ongoing projects to be rapidly accelerated, such as the
dismantlement of sovereignty, and the imposition of austerity.
Similarly,
the events of September 2001 enabled certain ongoing projects to be greatly
accelerated, such as the abandonment of civil liberties and international
law.
Before the towers had even come down, the Patriot Act had already been
drafted, proclaiming in no uncertain terms that the police state was here
(in the USA) in force and here to stay - the Bill of Rights was null and
void. Before long, similar anti-terrorist legislation had been adopted
throughout the first world.
If any anti-systemic movement were to again
raise its head in the first world (as it did, for example, recently in
Greece), arbitrary police powers could be brought to bear - as much as might
be necessary - to put the resistance down. No popular movement would be
allowed to derail the banksters regime-change designs.
The anti-globalization
movement had been shouting,
This is what real democracy looks like.
With
9/11, the banksters replied:
This is what real oppression looks like.
The events of 9/11 led directly to the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan,
and in general helped create a climate where invasions of sovereign nations
could be readily justified, with one excuse or another. International law
was to be as thoroughly abandoned as was civil liberties.
Just as all
restraint was removed from domestic police interventions, so was all
restraint being removed from geopolitical military interventions.
Nothing
was to stand in the way of the banksters regime-change agenda.
The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled
society
dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values
this
elite would not hesitate to achieve its political ends by using the latest
modern techniques for influencing public behavior
Persisting social
crisis, the emergence of a charismatic personality, and the exploitation of
mass media to obtain public confidence would be the stepping-stones in the
piecemeal transformation of the United States into a highly controlled
society
In addition, it may be possible - and tempting
- to exploit for
strategic political purposes the fruits of research on the brain and on
human behavior.

The Post-Capitalist Era
- New Myths for a New Culture
2012 might not be the exact year, but its difficult to see the endgame
lasting much beyond that - and the masters of the universe love symbolism,
as with 911 (both in Chile and in Manhattan), KLA 007, and others.
2012 is
loaded with symbolism, eg. the Mayan Calendar, and the Internet is buzzing
with various 2012-related prophecies, survival strategies, anticipated alien
interventions, etc. And then there is the Hollywood film, 2012, which
explicitly portrays the demise of most of humanity, and the pre-planned
salvation of a select few. One never knows with Hollywood productions, what
is escapist fantasy, and what is aimed at preparing the public mind
symbolically for what is to come.
Whatever the exact date, all the threads will come together, geopolitically
and domestically, and the world will change.
It will be a new era, just as
capitalism was a new era after aristocracy, and the Dark Ages followed the
era of the Roman Empire. Each era has its own structure, its own economics,
its own social forms, and its own mythology. These things must relate to one
another coherently, and their nature follows from the fundamental power
relationships and economic circumstances of the system.
Whenever there is a change of era, the previous era is always demonized in a
new mythology. In the Garden of Eden story the serpent is demonized - a
revered symbol in paganism, the predecessor to monotheism. With the rise of
European nation states,
the Catholic Church was demonized, and Protestantism
introduced.
When republics came along, the demonization of monarchs was an
important part of the process. In the post-2012 world, democracy and
national sovereignty will be demonized. This will be very important, in
getting people to accept arbitrary totalitarian rule
In those terrible dark days, before the blessed unification of humanity,
anarchy reigned in the world. One nation would attack another, no better
than predators in the wild. Nations had no long-term coherence; voters would
swing from one party to another, keeping governments always in transition
and confusion. How did anyone ever think that masses of semi-educated people
could govern themselves, and run a complex society?
Democracy was an
ill-conceived experiment that led only to corruption and chaotic governance.
How lucky we are to be in this well-ordered world, where humanity has
finally grown up, and those with the best expertise make the decisions for
the whole globe.
Capitalism is about growth, progress, and change. Under capitalism the
virtues of ambition, initiative, and competitiveness are praised, because
those virtues serve the dynamics of capitalism.
People are encouraged to
always accumulate more, and never be satisfied with what they have. Under
capitalism, people need to have a bit of liberty, and a bit of prosperity,
so that the dynamics of capitalism can operate. Without some liberty,
ambition cannot be pursued; without some prosperity, how could accumulation
be pursued? In the post-capitalist world, the capitalist virtues will be
demonized.
This will be very important, in getting people to accept poverty
and regimentation
The pursuit of money is the root of all evil, and the capitalist system was
inherently corrupt and wasteful. Anarchy reined in the marketplace, as
corporations blindly pursued profit, with no concern for human needs or for
the Earth. How much more sensible are our production brigades, producing
only what is needed, and using only what is sustainable.
Capitalism
encouraged greed and consumption; people struggled to compete with one
another, to get ahead in the rat race. How much wiser we are now, to live
within our ration quotas, and to accept our assigned duties, whatever they
might be, in service to humanity.
In this regime change, ushering in the post-capitalist era, were seeing a
conscious orchestration of economics, politics, geopolitics, and mythology - as one coordinated project. A whole new reality is being created, a whole
new global culture. When it comes down to it, the ability to transform
culture is the ultimate form of power. In only a single generation, a new
culture becomes the way things are.
And what, we might inquire, might
stand in the way of any future manipulations of the cultural regime that the bankster
'royal family' might contemplate?
Ever since public education was introduced, the state and the family have
competed to control childhood conditioning - and it is in childhood that
culture is transmitted to the next generation. In the micromanaged
post-capitalist future, well most likely see the final solution of social
control, which is for the state to monopolies child raising.
This would
eliminate from society the parent-child bond, and hence family-related bonds
in general. No longer is there a concept of relatives, just fellow members
of the hive. The family must be demonized.
Already, here in Ireland, there
are daily TV spots dramatizing the plight of children who are being abused
or neglected by their parents
How scary were the old days, when unlicensed, untrained couples had total
control over vulnerable children, behind closed doors, with whatever
neuroses, addictions, or perversions the parents happened to possess. How
did this vestige of patriarchal slavery, this safe-house den of child abuse,
continue so long to exist, and not be recognized for what it was?
How much
better off we are now, with children being raised scientifically, by trained
staff, where they are taught discipline and healthy values.
El Plan de La Élite
...Para un Nuevo Orden Social Mundial

Versión original en Ingles
Richard K. Moore (dice en su propio sitio) es un expatriado de Silicon
Valley en retiro, emigrado a Irlanda en 1994 para comenzar su "verdadero
trabajo": tratar de comprender cómo funciona el mundo y cómo podemos
mejorarlo.
Muchos años de investigación y escritura culminaron en su libro
ampliamente aclamado "Escaping the Matrix: How We the People Can Change the
World" (2005). Este artículo fue publicado primeramente en la revista
bimensual New Dawn (www.newdawnmagazine.com) de Septiembre de este año.
En
Global Research estaba la traducción de Germán Leyens que hemos corregido.
El título del artículo es lo suficientemente explicito en cuanto a su
contenido, y lo publicamos por el buen análisis que hace del cambio de
régimen que no se sabe si en efecto ocurrirá.
Cuando comenzó la Revolución Industrial en Gran Bretaña, a fines de los años
1700, se podía ganar mucho dinero invirtiendo en fábricas e industrias,
abriendo nuevos mercados, y obteniendo el control de fuentes de materias
primas.
Los que tenían más dinero para invertir, sin embargo, no eran tantos
en Gran Bretaña sino que estaban más bien en Holanda. Holanda había sido la
mayor potencia occidental en los años 1600, y sus banqueros eran los
principales capitalistas. En busca de beneficios, el capital holandés fluyó
hacia el mercado bursátil británico, y así los holandeses financiaron el
ascenso de Gran Bretaña, que luego eclipsó a Holanda económica y
geopolíticamente.
De esta manera el industrialismo británico llegó a ser dominado por
inversionistas acaudalados, y el capitalismo se convirtió en el sistema
económico dominante. Esto condujo a una gran transformación social. Gran
Bretaña había sido esencialmente una sociedad aristocrática, dominada por
familias terratenientes.
A medida que el capitalismo llegaba a ser
económicamente dominante, los capitalistas llegaron a ser dominantes en la
política. Las estructuras tributarias y las políticas de
importación-exportación fueron gradualmente modificadas para favorecer a los
inversionistas por sobre los terratenientes.
Ya no era económicamente viable mantener simplemente una propiedad en el
campo: había que desarrollarla, convertirla para un uso más productivo. Los
dramas de la época victoriana están repletos de historias de familias
aristocráticas que enfrentan tiempos difíciles, y se ven obligadas a vender
sus propiedades.
Para poder ser representada, esa decadencia era
generalmente atribuida a un defecto de algún carácter, tal vez un
primogénito débil. Pero en los hechos la decadencia de la aristocracia
formaba parte de una transformación social más amplia causada por el ascenso
del capitalismo.
El negocio del capitalista es la administración de capital, y esa
administración es manejada generalmente a través de la mediación de bancos y
casas de corretaje. No debería sorprender que los banqueros de inversión
llegaran a ocupar la cima de la jerarquía de la riqueza y el poder.
Y de
hecho, hay un puñado de familias de banqueros, incluidos
los Rothschild y
los Rockefeller, que ha llegado a dominar los asuntos económicos y políticos
en el mundo occidental.
A diferencia de los aristócratas, los capitalistas no están ligados a un
sitio, o al mantenimiento de un lugar. El capital es desleal y móvil; fluye
hacia donde se encuentra el mayor crecimiento, tal como fluyó de Holanda a
Gran Bretaña, luego de Gran Bretaña a EE.UU., y más recientemente de todas
partes a China. Tal como una mina de cobre puede ser explotada y luego
abandonada, así bajo el capitalismo toda una nación puede ser explotada y
luego abandonada, como lo vemos en las enmohecidas áreas industriales de
EE.UU. y Gran Bretaña.
Este desapego por el lugar conduce a un diferente tipo de geopolítica bajo
el capitalismo, en comparación con la aristocracia. Un rey va a la guerra
cuando ve una ventaja para su nación al emprenderla. Los historiadores
pueden "explicar" las guerras de los días pre-capitalistas en términos del
engrandecimiento de monarcas y naciones.
Un capitalista provoca una guerra a fin de lograr beneficios, y de hecho las
familias bancarias de nuestra élite han financiado ambos lados de la mayoría
de los conflictos militares desde por lo menos la Primera Guerra Mundial.
Por ello los historiadores tienen problemas para "explicar" la Primera
Guerra Mundial en términos de motivaciones y objetivos nacionales.
En los días pre-capitalistas la guerra era como el ajedrez: cada lado
trataba de ganar.
Bajo el capitalismo la guerra es más bien como un casino,
en el cual los jugadores participan mientras pueden conseguir dinero para
más fichas, y el ganador siempre resulta ser la casa: los banqueros que
financian la guerra y deciden quién será el último que quede en pie.
Las
guerras no son sólo las más lucrativas de todas las empresas capitalistas,
sino que al elegir a los vencedores y al administrar la reconstrucción, las
familias bancarias de la élite logran, con el tiempo, adecuar la
configuración geopolítica para que sirva a sus propios intereses.
Las naciones y las poblaciones son sólo peones en sus juegos. Millones
mueren en las guerras, las infraestructuras son destruidas, y mientras el
mundo está de duelo, los banqueros cuentan sus ganancias y hacen planes para
sus inversiones en la reconstrucción de posguerra.
Desde sus posiciones de poder, como financistas de los gobiernos, las élites
bancarias han perfeccionado con el tiempo sus métodos de control.
Permaneciendo siempre detrás del escenario, ellos tiran de las cuerdas que
controlan a los medios, los partidos políticos, las agencias de inteligencia,
los mercados bursátiles y las oficinas gubernamentales.
Y tal vez la mayor
palanca de poder es su control sobre las monedas. Mediante su fraude de los
bancos centrales, causan ciclos de auge y ruina, imprimen dinero de la nada
y luego lo prestan con intereses a los gobiernos.
El poder de la pandilla
bancaria de la élite (los "banksters") es absoluto y sutil
"Algunos de los más grandes hombres de EE.UU. tienen miedo de algo. Saben
que hay un poder en algún sitio, tan organizado, tan sutil, tan vigilante,
tan entrelazado, tan completo, tan dominante, que más vale que no hablen en
voz alta cuando lo hacen para condenarlo".
Presidente Woodrow Wilson
EL FINAL DEL CRECIMIENTO
- LOS BANKSTERS CONTRA EL CAPITALISMO
Siempre fue inevitable, en un planeta finito, que habría un límite para el
crecimiento económico.
La industrialización posibilitó que nos apresuráramos
precipitadamente hacia ese límite durante los últimos dos siglos. La
producción ha llegado a ser cada vez más eficiente, los mercados se han
hecho más globales, y finalmente el paradigma del crecimiento perpetuo ha
alcanzado el punto de la disminución de la rentabilidad.
Por cierto, a ese punto ya se llegó hacia 1970. Desde entonces el capital no
ha buscado tanto el crecimiento mediante un aumento de la producción, sino
más bien mediante la obtención de mayores rendimientos a partir de niveles
de producción relativamente limitados.
De aquí surge la globalización, que
transfirió la producción a áreas de bajos salarios, asegurando mayores
márgenes de beneficios. De aquí también la privatización, que transfiere a
los inversionistas las corrientes de ingresos que antes llegaban a las
tesorerías nacionales. De aquí los mercados derivados y de divisas, que
crean la ilusión electrónica de un crecimiento económico, sin producir nada
efectivamente en el mundo real.
Durante casi cuarenta años, el sistema capitalista se mantuvo mediante estos
diversos mecanismos, ninguno de los cuales fue productivo en algún sentido
real. Y entonces, en Septiembre de 2008, repentinamente el castillo de
naipes se desplomó, poniendo de rodillas al sistema financiero global.
Si uno estudia el colapso de las civilizaciones, uno aprende que esa
incapacidad de adaptación es fatal. ¿Está cayendo en esa trampa nuestra
civilización?.
Tuvimos dos siglos de verdadero crecimiento, en los cuales la
dinámica de crecimiento del capitalismo estuvo en armonía con la realidad
del crecimiento industrial. Luego tuvimos cuatro décadas de crecimiento
artificial - el capitalismo siendo sustentado por un castillo de naipes. Y
ahora, después del colapso del castillo de naipes, parece que se hace todo
el esfuerzo posible por producir "una recuperación"... ¡del crecimiento!.
Es
muy fácil obtener la impresión de que nuestra civilización se encuentra en
un proceso de colapso, basado en el principio de la incapacidad de
adaptación.
Una impresión semejante sería en parte correcta y en parte equivocada. A fin
de comprender la situación real, tenemos que hacer una clara distinción
entre la élite capitalista y el capitalismo en sí. El capitalismo es un
sistema económico impulsado por el crecimiento; la élite capitalista es la
gente que se las ha arreglado para conseguir el control del mundo occidental
mientras el capitalismo ha funcionado en los últimos dos siglos. El sistema
capitalista ha sobrepasado su fecha de vencimiento.
La élite de los banksters conoce perfectamente ese hecho
- y ellos se están adaptando.
El capitalismo es un vehículo que ha ayudado a llevar a los banksters al
poder absoluto, pero ellos no tienen más lealtad hacia ese sistema que la
que le tienen a un lugar, o a cualquier cosa o cualquier persona. Como
mencioné anteriormente, ellos piensan a escala global, donde naciones y
poblaciones son como peones. Ellos definen lo que es dinero y lo emiten,
exactamente como el banquero en un juego de Monopoly.
También pueden
inventar un nuevo juego con otro tipo de dinero. Hace tiempo que han
superado toda necesidad de depender de algún sistema económico en particular
para mantener su poder.
El capitalismo fue útil en una época de rápido
crecimiento. Para una época sin crecimiento, un juego diferente está siendo
preparado.
Así, al capitalismo no se le permitió que muriera una muerte natural. A
cambio, fue derribado mediante una demolición controlada. Primero lo
pusieron en un sistema de soporte vital, como mencionamos anteriormente, con
globalización, privatización, mercados cambiarios, etc.
Luego le inyectaron
una droga eutanásica, en la forma de burbujas inmobiliarias y derivados
tóxicos.
Finalmente, el Banco de Pagos Internacionales
- el banco central de
los bancos centrales - canceló el sistema de soporte vital: declaró la regla
de "ajustar los valores", lo que llevó a la insolvencia instantánea de todos
los bancos riesgosos, aunque tardó un tiempo antes de que fuera notoria.
Cada paso en este proceso fue cuidadosamente planificado y dirigido por la
camarilla de los bancos centrales.
EL FINAL DE LA SOBERANÍA
- RESTAURANDO EL ANTIGUO RÉGIMEN
Tal como el colapso financiero fue administrado cuidadosamente, así lo fue
el escenario posterior al colapso, con sus programas suicidas de rescate.
Los presupuestos nacionales ya estaban puestos al límite; ciertamente no
había reservas disponibles para salvar a los bancos insolventes. Por lo
tanto los compromisos de rescate no eran otra cosa que la aceptación por
parte de los gobiernos de nuevas deudas astronómicas.
A fin de pagar los
compromisos del rescate, ¡el dinero tenía que pedírsele prestado al mismo
sistema financiero que estaba siendo rescatado!.
No era que los bancos fueran demasiado grandes para quebrar, sino que más
bien los banksters eran demasiado poderosos para quebrar: éstos hicieron a
los políticos una oferta que no podían rechazar.
En EE.UU. se le dijo al
Congreso que sin rescates habría ley marcial a la mañana siguiente. En
Irlanda, se dijo a los ministros que habría caos financiero y disturbios en
las calles. De hecho, como Islandia lo demostró, la manera sensata de tratar
a los bancos insolventes era con un proceso ordenado de suspensión de pagos.
El efecto de los rescates bajo presión fue transferir la insolvencia de los
bancos a las tesorerías nacionales. Las deudas bancarias fueron
transformadas en deudas soberanas y déficits presupuestarios.
Ahora, de un
modo bastante predecible, son las naciones las que están buscando rescates,
y esos rescates llegan con condiciones adjuntas: en vez de que los bancos
caigan en suspensión de pagos [receivership], son las naciones las que están
cayendo bajo la administración de un síndico [receivership].
En su libro Confesiones de un Sicario Económico (Confessions of an Economic Hit Man),
John Perkins explica cómo
se ha coaccionado al Tercer Mundo durante las últimas décadas - mediante
presión y trucos de diversos tipos - para que acepten una esclavitud perpetua
por deudas. Por su propio diseño, las deudas nunca pueden ser pagadas.
En
vez de ello, las deudas deben ser periódicamente refinanciadas, y cada nuevo
refinanciamiento entierra más profundamente a la nación en las deudas - y la
lleva a someterse a dictados aún más drásticos del FMI.
Con el colapso
financiero orquestado, y el timo del "demasiado grande para quebrar", los banksters han creado una situación en la que no hay vuelta atrás: la agenda
de los sicarios está ahora operando aquí en el Primer Mundo.
En la Unión Europea, el primer grupo de naciones en caer serán los así
llamados PIIGS:
-
Portugal
-
Irlanda
-
Italia
-
Grecia
-
España
La ficción de que los PIIGS pueden encarar los rescates se basa en la suposición de que se
reanudará la era del crecimiento ilimitado.
Como lo saben perfectamente los banksters, eso simplemente no va a suceder. Finalmente el grupo PIIGS se verá
forzado al incumplimiento de pagos [default], y entonces el resto de la UE
también se derrumbará, todo como parte de un proyecto de demolición
controlada.
Cuando una nación sucumbe a la esclavitud por deudas, deja de ser una nación
soberana, gobernada por algún tipo de proceso político interno. En vez de
ello cae bajo el control de
los dictados del FMI.
Como hemos visto en el
Tercer Mundo - y está sucediendo ahora en Europa - esos dictados tienen que
ver con austeridad y privatización.
Las funciones del gobierno son
eliminadas o privatizadas, y los recursos nacionales son vendidos como en
liquidación. Poco a poco - de nuevo una demolición controlada - la
nación-Estado es desmantelada. Finalmente, las funciones primordiales que le
quedan al gobierno son la represión policial de su propia población, y el
cobro de impuestos para entregarlos a los banksters.
De hecho, el desmantelamiento de la nación-Estado comenzó mucho antes del
colapso financiero de 2008. En EE.UU. y Gran Bretaña comenzó en 1980 con
Reagan y Thatcher.
En Europa comenzó en 1988, con el Tratado de Maastricht.
La globalización aceleró el proceso de desmantelamiento, a través de la
transferencia al exterior de los puestos de trabajo y las industrias, de
programas de privatización, acuerdos de "libre comercio" y el
establecimiento de la Organización Mundial de Comercio (OMC), destructora de
las regulaciones.
Los eventos desde 2008 han posibilitado la rápida
aceleración de un proceso que ya estaba perfectamente encaminado.
Con el colapso, los rescates, y la total dejadez para perseguir alguna clase
de un efectivo programa de recuperación, las señales son muy claras: se
dejará que el sistema colapse totalmente, allanando así el terreno para una
"solución" previamente diseñada. Mientras se desmantela la nación-Estado, se
establece un nuevo régimen de autoridad global para reemplazarla.
Como
podemos ver en el caso de la OMC, el FMI, el Banco Mundial, y las otras
partes del gobierno mundial embrionario, el nuevo sistema global no mostrará
pretensiones de representación popular o proceso democrático. El gobierno
tendrá lugar a través de burocracias autocráticas globales, que recibirán
sus órdenes, directa o indirectamente, de la camarilla de los banksters.
En su libro The Globalization of Poverty [La Globalización de la Pobreza],
Michel Chossudovsky explica cómo la globalización y las acciones del FMI
crearon una pobreza masiva en todo el Tercer Mundo durante las últimas
décadas.
Como podemos ver, con el dramático énfasis en la austeridad,
después del colapso y los rescates, este proyecto de creación de pobreza ya
no tiene vuelta atrás. En este nuevo sistema mundial no habrá ninguna clase
media próspera. En realidad, el nuevo régimen se parecerá en mucho a los
antiguos días de la realeza y la servidumbre (el antiguo régimen).
Los banksters son la nueva 'familia real', y todo el mundo será su dominio.
Los
tecnócratas que dirigen las burocracias globales, y los mandarines que se
presentan como políticos en las naciones residuales, son la clase superior
privilegiada.
El resto de nosotros, la abrumadora mayoría, nos encontraremos
en el papel de los siervos empobrecidos - si tenemos la suficiente suerte de
estar entre los supervivientes del proceso de colapso.
"Hoy los estadounidenses se indignarían si tropas de la ONU entraran a Los
Angeles para restaurar el orden; mañana lo agradecerán. Esto es
especialmente verdadero si se les dice que hay una amenaza (del espacio)
exterior, sea real o sólo proclamada, que amenazaría nuestra propia
existencia.
Entonces todos los pueblos del mundo rogarán a los dirigentes
del mundo que los libren de ese mal. Lo único que todo hombre teme es lo
desconocido. Cuando se le presenta ese escenario, renunciará voluntariamente
a sus derechos individuales a cambio de la garantía de su bienestar otorgada
por su gobierno mundial"
Henry Kissinger
hablando en Evian, Francia, 21 de
Mayo de 1992, reunión de
los Bilderberger
EL FINAL DE LA LIBERTAD
- EL ESTADO POLICIAL GLOBAL
Durante las últimas cuatro décadas, desde aproximadamente 1970, hemos estado
viviendo un proceso de cambio de régimen, desde un antiguo sistema global a
un nuevo sistema global.
En el antiguo sistema, las naciones del Primer
Mundo eran relativamente democráticas y prósperas, mientras el Tercer Mundo
sufría bajo la tiranía de Estados policiales, pobreza masiva e imperialismo
(explotación por potencias extranjeras).
Como lo mencionamos antes, el
proceso de transición ha sido caracterizado como "el cruce del Rubicón" (sin
vuelta atrás):
la introducción en el Primer Mundo de políticas y prácticas
que antes estaban limitadas, en su mayor parte, al Tercer Mundo.
Por lo tanto la esclavitud por deudas con el FMI
cruzó el Rubicón (punto de no-regreso),
posibilitado por la estafa del colapso-rescate. Por su parte, la pobreza
masiva está cruzando el mismo Rubicón, debido a las medidas de austeridad
impuestas por el FMI, con sus nuevos poderes de posesión de bonos.
El
imperialismo también está cruzando el Rubicón, mientras el Primer Mundo cae
bajo el control explotador de los banksters y sus burocracias, un nexo
impositivo del poder que es ajeno a todas las identidades nacionales. No es
sorprendente que la tiranía del Estado policial también esté cruzando el
Rubicón: la imposición de los niveles de pobreza del Tercer Mundo requiere
métodos de represión del Tercer Mundo.
El movimiento contra la globalización puede ser considerado como el comienzo
de la resistencia popular contra el proceso de cambio de régimen.
De la
misma manera, la reacción policial a las manifestaciones contra la
globalización de Seattle, en Noviembre de 1999, puede ser interpretada como
el "cruce del Rubicón" de la tiranía del Estado policial. La violencia
excesiva y arbitraria de esa reacción - incluyendo cosas como mantener
abiertos los ojos de la gente y rociarles pimienta en ellos - no tenía
precedentes en acciones contra manifestantes no-violentos en una nación del
Primer Mundo.
Irónicamente, esa reacción policial, especialmente porque fue tan
ampliamente publicitada, realmente fortaleció el movimiento contra la
globalización. A medida que las manifestaciones crecían en tamaño y fuerza,
la reacción policial se hizo aún más violenta.
Un cierto clímax
fue
alcanzado en Génova, en Julio de 2001, cuando los niveles de violencia de
ambas partes casi comenzaron a parecer una guerra de guerrillas.
En esos días el movimiento contra la globalización dominaba las páginas de
las noticias internacionales, y la oposición a la globalización alcanzaba
proporciones masivas. El movimiento visible era solo la punta de un iceberg
anti-sistémico. En un sentido muy real, el sentimiento popular general en el
Primer Mundo comenzaba a tomar un giro radical. Los dirigentes del
movimiento pensaban ahora en términos de un movimiento anti-capitalista.
Había volatilidad política en el aire, en el sentido de que posiblemente un
sentimiento popular ilustrado podría lograr un cambio en el curso de los
eventos.
Todo eso cambió
el 11 de Septiembre de 2001, el día en que cayeron las
torres. El movimiento anti-globalización, junto con la propia globalización,
desaparecieron casi enteramente de la conciencia pública en ese fatídico
día. Repentinamente hubo un escenario global totalmente nuevo, todo un nuevo
circo mediático, con un nuevo enemigo y un nuevo tipo de guerra, una guerra
sin final, una guerra contra fantasmas, una guerra contra el "terrorismo".
Anteriormente vimos cómo el orquestado colapso financiero de Septiembre de
2008 posibilitó que ciertos proyectos existentes fueran rápidamente
acelerados, como el desmantelamiento de la soberanía y la imposición de
austeridad. Del mismo modo, los eventos de Septiembre de 2001 posibilitaron
que otros proyectos existentes fueran acelerados considerablemente, como el
abandono de las libertades civiles y del derecho internacional.
Antes de que las torres incluso cayeran, la "Ley Patriota" (Patriot Act) ya
había sido redactada, proclamando de manera muy clara que había llegado el
Estado policial (a EE.UU.) con toda su fuerza y para quedarse.
La
Declaración de Derechos (Bill of Rights) quedó sin efecto.
Antes de mucho
tiempo, una similar legislación "anti-terrorista" había sido adoptada en
todo el Primer Mundo. Si algún movimiento anti-sistémico volvía a levantar
cabeza en el Primer Mundo (como lo hizo, por ejemplo, recientemente en
Grecia), se podrían poner en práctica poderes policiales arbitrarios - tantos
como fuera necesario - para aplastar la resistencia.
No se permitiría que
ningún movimiento popular desbaratara los designios de cambio de régimen de
los banksters.
El movimiento anti-globalización había estado gritando:
"Ésta
es la verdadera democracia".
Con el 11-S, los banksters replicaron:
"Ésta es la verdadera
opresión".
Los eventos del 11-S condujeron directamente a las invasiones de
Irak y
Afganistán, y en general ayudaron a crear un clima en el cual las invasiones
de naciones soberanas podían ser prontamente justificadas con una u otra
excusa.
El derecho internacional fue totalmente abandonado como lo fueron
las libertades civiles. Tal como se eliminó toda restricción de las
intervenciones policiales domésticas, así se eliminó toda restricción de las
intervenciones militares geopolíticas.
Nada debía interponerse en el camino
de la agenda de cambio de régimen de los banksters.
La era tecnotrónica involucra la aparición gradual de una sociedad más
controlada
dominada por una élite, no limitada por valores tradicionales
esta élite no dudaría en lograr sus objetivos políticos utilizando las
últimas técnicas modernas para influir sobre la conducta pública
La
persistencia de la crisis social, la emergencia de una personalidad
carismática, y la explotación de medios de comunicación de masas para
obtener la confianza pública serían los escalones en la transformación
gradual de EE.UU. en una sociedad altamente controlada
Además, podría ser
posible - y tentador - explotar para propósitos políticos estratégicos los
frutos de la investigación sobre el cerebro y la conducta humana"
Zbigniew Brzezinski, La Era Tecnotrónica, 1970
LA ERA POST-CAPITALISTA
- NUEVOS MITOS PARA UNA NUEVA CULTURA
Puede que 2012 no sea el año exacto, pero es dificultoso ver que la fase
final dure mucho más - y los amos del universo aman el simbolismo, como el
del 11-S (tanto en Chile como en Manhattan), y otros.
El 2012 está cargado de
simbolismo, por ejemplo el del Calendario Maya, e Internet es un hervidero
de diversas profecías relacionadas con 2012, estrategias de supervivencia,
espera de intervenciones alienígenas, etc.
Y luego está la cinta de
Hollywood, "2012", que presenta explícitamente el fin de la mayor parte de
la Humanidad, y la salvación planificada previamente de unos pocos
escogidos. Uno nunca sabe diferenciar en las producciones de Hollywood lo
que es fantasía escapista de lo que está destinado a preparar simbólicamente
la mente del público para lo que vendrá.
Sea cual fuere la fecha exacta, toda la hebras se entrelazarán, geopolítica
y domésticamente, y el mundo cambiará. Será una nueva era, tal como el
capitalismo fue una nueva era después de la aristocracia, y la Alta Edad
Media siguió a la era del Imperio Romano.
Cada era tiene su propia
estructura, su propia economía, sus propias formas sociales, y su propia
mitología. Estas cosas deben relacionarse coherentemente entre sí, y su
naturaleza proviene de las fundamentales relaciones de poder y
circunstancias económicas del sistema.
Cada vez que hay un cambio de época, la época anterior siempre es demonizada
en una nueva mitología. En la historia del Jardín del Edén la serpiente es
demonizada - un símbolo reverenciado en el paganismo, el predecesor del
monoteísmo. Con la aparición de las naciones-Estado europeas,
la Iglesia
Católica fue demonizada, y el protestantismo fue puesto en práctica.
Cuando
llegaron las repúblicas, la demonización de los monarcas fue una parte
importante del proceso. En el mundo posterior a 2012, se demonizará la
democracia y la soberanía nacional. Esto será muy importante para conseguir
que la gente acepte un régimen totalitario arbitrario
En esos terribles días tenebrosos, antes de la bendita unificación de la
Humanidad, la anarquía reinaba en el mundo. Una nación atacaba a otra, como
los depredadores en la selva. Las naciones no tenían coherencia a largo
plazo; los votantes pasaban de un partido al otro, manteniendo siempre en
transición y confusión a los gobiernos.
¿Cómo pudo llegar alguien a pensar
que las masas de gente semi-educada podrían gobernarse, o dirigir una
sociedad compleja?
La democracia fue un experimento mal concebido que
condujo solo a la corrupción y al gobierno caótico. ¡Qué suerte tenemos de
estar en este mundo tan ordenado, en el cual la Humanidad finalmente ha
crecido, y en el cual aquellos mejor preparados toman las decisiones para
todo el globo.
El capitalismo tiene que ver con crecimiento, progreso y cambio. Bajo el
capitalismo las virtudes de la ambición, la iniciativa y la competitividad
son elogiadas, porque esas virtudes sirven a la dinámica del capitalismo. La
gente es alentada a acumular siempre más, y a no darse jamás por satisfecha
con lo que tiene. Bajo el capitalismo, la gente tiene que tener un poco de
libertad, y un poco de prosperidad, para que la dinámica del capitalismo
pueda operar.
Sin una cierta libertad, la ambición no puede ser continua;
sin una cierta prosperidad ¿cómo se puede lograr la acumulación?. En el
mundo post-capitalista, las virtudes capitalistas serán demonizadas.
Esto
será muy importante para lograr que la gente acepte la pobreza y el control
disciplinario
La búsqueda del dinero es la raíz de todo mal, y el sistema capitalista era
inherentemente corrupto y derrochador. La anarquía reinaba en el mercado,
mientras las corporaciones ciegamente buscaban beneficios, sin preocuparse
por las necesidades humanas o por la Tierra. Cuánto más sensatas son
nuestras brigadas de trabajo, que producen sólo lo necesario, y usan sólo lo
que es sustentable.
El capitalismo alentaba la codicia y el consumo; la
gente luchaba para competir unos contra otros, por "ser los primeros" en la
carrera de ratas. Cuánto más sabios somos ahora, que vivimos con nuestras
cuotas racionadas y aceptamos los deberes que se nos asignan, sean cuales
sean, sirviendo a la Humanidad.
En este cambio de régimen que lidera la época post-capitalista, estamos
viendo una orquestación consciente de economía, política, geopolítica y
mitología, como un proyecto coordinado. Se está creando toda una nueva
realidad, toda una nueva cultura global. Cuando se trata del tema, la
capacidad de transformar la cultura es la máxima forma de poder. En sólo una
generación, una nueva cultura se convierte en "la manera en que las cosas
son".
¿Y qué - podemos preguntar - podría interponerse en el camino de
cualquier futura manipulación del régimen cultural que se le antoje a la
'familia real' bankster?
Desde que se introdujo la educación pública, el Estado y la familia han
competido por controlar el condicionamiento de la infancia - y es en la
infancia cuando se transmite la cultura a la próxima generación.
En el
micro-administrado futuro post-capitalista, es muy probable que veamos la
"solución final" del control social: que el Estado monopolice la educación
de los niños. Eso eliminaría de la sociedad el lazo entre padre e hijo, y
por lo tanto los lazos que lo unen a su familia en general. No más el
concepto de parientes, sino sólo de otros miembros de la colmena.
La familia
debe ser demonizada. Aquí en Irlanda ya hay anuncios publicitarios en la
televisión dramatizando los sufrimientos de los niños que son abusados o
descuidados por sus padres
Qué horribles eran los antiguos días, cuando parejas sin permiso, sin
capacitación, tenían control total sobre niños vulnerables, a puertas
cerradas, con todas las neurosis, adicciones o perversiones que los padres
tuvieran.
¿Cómo existió durante tanto tiempo ese vestigio de esclavitud
patriarcal, la guarida refugio del abuso infantil, sin ser reconocida por lo
que era?.
Cuánto mejor nos va ahora, con niños educados científicamente, por
personal capacitado, donde se les enseña disciplina y valores sanos.
