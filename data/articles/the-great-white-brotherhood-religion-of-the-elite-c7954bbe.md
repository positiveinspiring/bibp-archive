If you want to raise the ultimate kind of power within Satanism you
sacrifice someone. In the highest levels of Satanism they believe
the best way to raise your energy is by murdering something, either
an animal or a person. With a human being theres an enormous amount
of energy released.
Bill Schnoebelen
The most powerful
Illuminati bloodlines lead the Satanic Hierarchy and are
part of Satans Kingdom. Each of these bloodlines have demonic
princes, just like the man and demon Prince of Persia in the Bible.
The following overview has been composed by
former Illuminati members.
Male Part
Royal Ipsimus
Council of the Grand Druids
Higher Masters
Pentacle Servants Regular Witchcraft Circle
(Under the leadership of a Priest)
Female Part
Queen of Darkness
Grande Mother of Darkness (13 degrees)
Sisters of the Light (9 degrees)
Matriarch Regular Witchcraft Circle
(Under the leadership of a Priestess) 1
1 A witchcraft circle is part of the lowest
level of organized Satanism (comparable to a unit of the army) and consists
of thirteen witches with a priest or priestess as officer.
Within organized Satanism, at the highest level
of the Illuminati structure, at the top of the pyramid and above the Royal
Ipsimus, we find The Great White Brotherhood.

Few people are aware of the existence of this
organization because The Great White Lodge of The Great White Brotherhood
is not a visible organization. Its members do not gather for meetings nor do
they have a temple of their own. The structures within The Great White
Brotherhood are actually very simple. Satan is the Deputy
Grandmaster of the Great White Lodge, with other spiritual members being
demons.
Both Satan and his demons are in constant
telepathic contact with the few visible (human) leaders of the Brotherhood.
Introduction to The Great White Brotherhood takes place through a
Cosmic Initiation.
Potential candidates are recruited in different
ways. Members of the Brotherhood meet a certain person who they believe has
the personality that makes him or her suitable for the lifestyle within the
Brotherhood. The new victim is not addressed directly. First, the candidacy
of this new member is discussed with the Grandmaster of the highest Degree
who will have him tailed.2
2 The Grandmaster of the high Degree is called
the Master of the Chair. He possesses the highest degree of power.
A thorough background check is carried out, with
all the habits, preferences, strengths and weaknesses of the candidate
meticulously mapped out.
When sufficient information concerning the life of a potential new member
has been collected, and when it is determined that he is easily influenced,
the Masters will order a detailed plan to be drawn up to bring the potential
candidate into contact with the Brotherhood.
This sophisticated approach usually works
perfectly. The Brotherhood takes the initiative, and all the prospective new
members have to do is take the bait. Often, they have no idea that a fine
net is being spun around them.
The first real contact takes place in such a way as to ensure that the
meeting makes an overwhelming impression on the new candidate. When the
Brotherhood decides to add a new member to its organization, the action has
to succeed. A person informed of the existence of the Brotherhood that
decides not to become a member usually places his life in danger.
People who have been marked as untrustworthy
almost certainly risk losing their lives.
In this regard, the Brotherhoods motto is:
It is better to have a reliable member end
the life of a hazy suspect than to be exposed by an unreliable member.
Executions ordered by the Brotherhood
will only be carried out when there is a guarantee that the act will not be
discovered.
When the candidate has been dazzled by the Brotherhood and has declared a
willingness to be initiated into the teachings of the Brotherhood, there is
no going back. At least six Masters and one of the higher Masters are
present at the acceptance ceremony.
The light is dimmed, candles and oil lamps are
lit, and incense is burned. The leading Master pronounces the oath,
repeating it six times while looking into the eyes of those present. It is
important to look into each others eyes when pronouncing the oath. Like
with the Rosicrucian Brotherhood,
the Freemasons and
other occult societies, the candidate
is connected to a demon through hypnosis during the ceremony.3
3 With Satanic rituals, initiations and ritual
murders, hypnosis and witchcraft are used.
The text of the oath is as follows:
I swear on my life and my soul never to
reveal that which fate lets me encounter on this night. Should I, my
friend, break this holy oath, I hereby officially grant permission to
annul my life and my soul.
After that, all seven who are present pronounce
the oath six times. They do so solemnly and with great emphasis. During the
test, which comes next, a phenomenon called the transfiguration
occurs. The demon literally takes possession of the spirit of the newcomer.
In addition to dreams and astral projections, a kind of fata morgana
can also transmit visions.
Before the test takes place, the candidate is told that he has been chosen
by providence to possess special powers.
These powers will be transmitted to him
through another human being. The way this is done is secret and the
candidate has to swear never to reveal that secret. After the candidate once
again swears on his life never to reveal the knowledge he will receive, the
Grandmaster and the other Masters present tell him about rituals from the
Incas and the Celtic Druids. He is not told how these rituals were carried
out in practice; he is only told that they exist and that they involve
natural processes.
The candidate is told which priests were
authorized to transmit which powers, and that these secret techniques are
only passed on to a handful of the chosen. For thousands of years these
practices have been carried out in secret, and it has to stay that way for
all eternity. The Incas were masters in transmitting special powers,
and the candidate is told that he is about to experience how they did it.
One of the most powerful Grandmasters within the Illuminati (Hohen Meister
von Stuhl), in his book
334 Pro Mille Lies, writes the
following about his first test and initiation:
Present in the room were a woman, five
Masters and a Grandmaster. Before the test commenced, one of them
suggested we eat something first.
The woman asked those present what kind of
pizza they wanted, and she ordered them by telephone from a pizzeria
nearby. When she had put down the telephone, she left the house. At the
time, I had no idea what this behavior meant. After a while the woman
returned, bringing a young man who carried a pile of boxes from which
the delicious smell of pizza emanated. We were all very hungry. The
Grandmaster asked the pizza delivery boy to sit down while he fetched
the money. The boy was offered a large glass of soda, which he emptied
in just a few big gulps.
The pizzas were put on plates and cut. The
young man fell into a deep sleep. I was very worried. Had they poisoned
him? The Grandmaster assured me that the pizza delivery boy had only
been sedated. He suggested we eat first, and we ate our pizzas.
After we finished, we cleaned up.
Then we put on white, nightgown-like robes
and brought the pizza delivery boy to the basement. The Masters tied him
to a metal rack that was placed in the center of the basement room. They
attached leather cuffs to his wrists and tied him so tightly that he
appeared to be crucified to the metal rack. By then he had regained
consciousness.
We sat in a circle around him. The
Grandmaster told me the pizza delivery boy belonged to me and that I
could withdraw as much energy from him as I wanted. He then handed me a
large knife and made an inviting gesture towards the restrained boy. I
understood. 4

Hohen Meister von Stuhl, Frankfurt 2002, 75.
Next, the anonymous author describes how he
murdered the pizza delivery boy in a gruesome way. The torture and
bloodshed, which are described in detail, are absolutely unfit for reading.
A Grandmaster of the Chair can never
occupy an official position, nor will he ever be able to manage a
multinational company. The reason for this is that visible leaders have to
leave their position from time to time, when they are demanded to do so by a
majority of the population.
In other words, the visible leaders of this
world come and go, whereas the invisible leaders controlling them are always
the same.
