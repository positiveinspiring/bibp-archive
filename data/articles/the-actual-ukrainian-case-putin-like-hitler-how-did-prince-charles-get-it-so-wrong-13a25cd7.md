Far from being 'like Hitler'
as Prince
Charles accuses,
Putin is sober, cautious,
defensive, a stickler for international law,
determined
to modernize Russia,
and anxious to avoid military
confrontation.
Israel Shamir sees through the NATO
propaganda
Putin's choice is not an easy one.
As Russia
procrastinates, as the U.S. doubles the risks, the world draws nearer to
the nuclear abyss. Who will chicken out?
It is not much fun to be in Kiev these days. The
revolutionary excitement is over, and hopes for new faces, the end of
corruption and economic improvement have withered.
The
Maidan street revolt and the subsequent coup
just reshuffled the same marked deck of cards, forever rotating in power.
The new acting President has been an acting
prime minister, and a KGB (called 'SBU' in Ukrainian) supremo.
The new acting prime minister has been a foreign
minister. The oligarch most likely to be 'elected' President in a few days
has been a foreign minister, the head of the state bank, and personal
treasurer of two coups, in 2004 (installing Yushchenko) and in 2014
(installing himself).
His main competitor, Mme Timoshenko, served as a
prime minister for years, until electoral defeat in 2010.
The new rulers are the
ones that ruined Ukraine
These people had brought Ukraine to its present
abject state. In 1991, the Ukraine was richer than Russia, today it is three
times poorer because of these people's mismanagement and theft.
Now they plan an old trick: to take loans in
Ukraine's name, pocket the cash and leave the country indebted. They sell
state assets to Western companies and ask for NATO to come in and protect
the investment.
They play a hard game, brass knuckles and all.
The Black Guard, a new SS-like armed force of the neo-nazi Right Sector,
prowls the land. They arrest or kill dissidents, activists, journalists.

IMF-dictated reforms slashed pensions by half
and doubled the housing rents.
In the market, U.S. Army rations took the
place of local food.
Kiev - even the pretence
of democracy has gone
The new Kiev regime had dropped the last
pretence of democracy by expelling the Communists from the parliament. This
should endear them to the U.S. even more.
Expel Communists, apply for NATO, condemn
Russia, arrange a gay parade and you may do anything at all, even fry dozens
of citizens alive. And so they did.
The harshest repressions were unleashed on
industrial Novorossia, as its working class loathes the whole lot of
oligarchs and ultra-nationalists.
After the blazing inferno of Odessa and a wanton
shooting on the streets of Melitopol the two rebellious provinces of Donetsk
and Lugansk took up arms and declared their independence from the Kiev
regime. They came under fire, but did not surrender.
The other six Russian-speaking industrial
provinces of Novorossia were quickly cowed. Dnepropetrovsk and Odessa were
terrorized by personal army of Mr Kolomoysky. Kharkov was misled by its
tricky governor.
Russia did not interfere and did not support the
rebellion, to the great distress of Russian nationalists in Ukraine and
Russia who mutter about "betrayal".
So much for the warlike rhetoric of
McCain and Brzezinski.
An exasperating respect
for international law
Putin's respect for others' sovereignty is
exasperating. I understand this sounds like a joke - you hear so much about
Putin as a "new Hitler" - most recently in unguarded comments from
Prince
Charles on his Canadian tour:
Prince Charles 'Compared Russian Actions to
Nazis'
21 May 2014
A former Polish war refugee who met Prince Charles in Canada has said
he likened some Nazi actions in Europe to those of Russia's Vladimir
Putin.
Marienne Ferguson was speaking after meeting Prince Charles at a Nova
Scotia immigration museum where she works.
As they discussed Hitler's takeover of countries, the prince,
"said something to the effect of 'it's
not unlike... what Putin is doing,'" she recalled.
Clarence House said it would not comment on
a private conversation.
The prince and the Russian president are both due to attend a D-Day
anniversary event in France next month.
Speaking from China, President Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov
told the BBC he was "not commenting right now" on the remarks.

As a matter of fact, Putin had legal training
before joining the Secret Service. He is a stickler for international law.
His Russia has interfered with other states much less than France or
England, let alone the U.S..
I asked his senior adviser, Mr. Alexei Pushkov,
why Russia did not try to influence Ukrainian minds while Kiev buzzed with
American and European officials.
"We think it is wrong to interfere", he
replied like a good Sunday schoolboy.
"It is rather likely Putin's advisors misjudged
public sentiment. The majority of Novorossia's population does not like the
new Kiev regime, but being politically passive and conservative, will submit
to its rule", they estimated.
"The rebels are a small bunch of firebrands
without mass support, and they can't be relied upon", was their view.
Accordingly, Putin advised the rebels to postpone the referendum
indefinitely, a polite way of saying "drop it".
A convincing vote for
secession
They disregarded his request with considerable
sang froid and convincingly voted en masse for secession from a collapsing
Ukraine. The turnout was much higher than expected, the support for the move
near total.
As I was told by a Kremlin insider, this
development was not foreseen by Putin's advisers.
Perhaps the advisors had read it right, but
three developments had changed the voters' minds and had sent this placid
people to the barricades and the voting booths.
1. The Odessa
incineration
The first one was the
fiery holocaust of
Odessa, where the peaceful and carelessly unarmed demonstrating workers
were suddenly attacked by regime's thugs - the Ukrainian equivalent of
Mubarak's shabab - and corralled into the Trade Unions Headquarters.
The building was set on fire, and the
far-right pro-regime Black Guard positioned snipers to efficiently pick
off would-be escapees.
Some fifty, mainly elderly, Russian-speaking
workers were burned alive or shot as they rushed for the windows and the
doors. This dreadful event was turned into an occasion of merriment and
joy by Ukrainian nationalists who referred to their slain compatriots as
"fried beetles".
It is being said that this auto-da-fé was
organized by the shock troops of Jewish oligarch and strongman
Kolomoysky, who coveted the port of Odessa.
Despite his cuddly bear appearance, he is
pugnacious and violent person, who offered $10,000 for a captive
Russian, dead or alive, and proposed a cool $1 million for the head of
Mr Tsarev, a Member of Parliament from Donetsk.
2. The Mariupol
pogrom
The second was the
Mariupol attack on May 9,
2014. This day is commemorated as V-day in Russia and Ukraine (while the
West celebrates it on May 8). The Kiev regime forbade all V-day
celebrations.
In Mariupol, the Black Guard attacked the
peaceful and weaponless town, burning down the police headquarters and
killing local policemen who had refused to suppress the festive march.
Afterwards, Black Guard thugs unleashed armored vehicles on the
streets, killing citizens and destroying property.
The West did not voice any protest. Nuland
and Merkel weren't horrified by this mass murder, as they were by Yanukovich's timid attempts to control crowds.
The people of these two provinces felt
abandoned. They understood that nobody was going to protect and save
them but themselves, and went off to vote.
3. The Eurovision Song Contest. Yes, seriously
The third development was, bizarrely, the
Eurovision jury choice of the Austrian transgender singer Conchita Wurst
as winner of its 2014 song contest.
The politically correct judges of the jury
chose to "celebrate tolerance", in line with Western European cultural
trends.
However this support for re-gendering did not go
down well with most Russians and / or Ukrainians, who remain socially
conservative on such issues.
Traditionally minded Novorossians want no
part of such a Europe, which they see as an affront to their values,
traditions, religion and culture.
The Russians have readjusted their sights, but
they do not intend to bring their troops into the two rebel republics,
unless dramatic developments should force them.
Sochi Olympics were
meant to showcase the new Russia
Imagine: you are dressed up for a night on
Broadway, but your neighbors are involved in a vicious quarrel, and you
have to gun up and deal with the trouble instead of enjoying a show, and a
dinner, and perhaps a date. This was Putin's position regarding the
Ukrainian turmoil.
A few months ago, Russia had made a huge effort
to become, and to be seen as, a very civilized European state of the first
magnitude.
This was the message of the Sochi
Olympic games:
to re-brand, even re-invent Russia, just as Peter the
Great once had, as part of the First World; an amazing country of strong
European tradition, of Leo Tolstoy and Malevich, of Tchaikovsky and
Diaghilev, the land of arts, of daring social reform, of technical
achievements, of modernity and beyond - the Russia of Natasha Rostova riding
a Sikorsky 'copter.
Putin spent $60 billion to broadcast this image.
The old fox
Henry Kissinger wisely
said:
"Putin spent $60 billion on the Olympics.
They had opening and closing ceremonies, trying to show Russia as a
normal progressive state. So it isn't possible that he, three days
later, would voluntarily start an assault on Ukraine.
"There is no doubt that
at all times he
wanted Ukraine in a subordinate position. And at all times, every senior
Russian that I've ever met, including dissidents like Solzhenitsyn and
Brodsky, looked at Ukraine as part of the Russian heritage.
But I don't
think he had planned to bring it to a head now."
But the U.S. does not
want a modern Russia
However, Washington hawks decided to do whatever
it takes to keep Russia out in the cold.
They were afraid of this image of
"a normal progressive state" as such a Russia would render NATO irrelevant
and undermine European dependence on the U.S.
They were adamant about retaining their
hegemony, shattered as it was by the
Syrian confrontation. They attacked Russian positions in the Ukraine and
arranged a violent coup,
installing a viciously anti-Russian regime supported by football fans
and neo-Nazis, paid for by Jewish oligarchs and American taxpayers.
The victors banned the Russian language and
prepared to void treaties with Russia regarding its Crimean naval base at
Sebastopol on the Black Sea. This base was to become a great new NATO base,
controlling the Black Sea and threatening Russia.
Putin had to deal quickly and so he did, by
accepting the Crimean people's request to join Russian Federation. This
dealt with the immediate problem of the base, but the problem of Ukraine
remained.
A Ukraine hostile to
Russia is not acceptable
The Ukraine is not a foreign entity to Russians,
it is the western half of Russia. It was artificially separated from the rest in
1991, at the collapse of the USSR.
The people of the two parts are interconnected
by family, culture and blood ties; their economies are intricately
connected. While a separate viable Ukrainian state is a possibility, an
'independent' Ukrainian state hostile to Russia is not viable and can't be
tolerated by any Russian ruler.
And this for military as well as for cultural
reasons: if Hitler had begun the war against Russia from its present border,
he would have taken Stalingrad in two days and would have destroyed Russia
in a week.
A more pro-active Russian ruler would have sent
troops to Kiev a long time ago. Thus did Czar Alexis when the Poles,
Cossacks and Tatars argued for it in 17th century. So also did
Czar Peter the Great, when the Swedes occupied it in the 18th
century. So did Lenin, when the Germans set up the Protectorate of Ukraine
(he called its establishment "the obscene peace").
So did Stalin, when the Germans occupied the
Ukraine in 1941.
Washington's
geo-political goals
Putin still hopes to settle the problem by
peaceful means, relying upon the popular support of the Ukrainian people.
Actually, before the Crimean takeover, the majority of Ukrainians (and near
all Novorossians) overwhelmingly supported some sort of union with Russia.
Otherwise, the Kiev coup would not have been necessary.
The forced Crimean takeover seriously undermined
Russian appeal. The people of Ukraine did not like it. This was foreseen by
the Kremlin, but they had to accept Crimea for a few reasons.
Firstly, a loss of Sevastopol naval base to NATO
was a too horrible of an alternative to contemplate. Secondly, the Russian
people would not understand if Putin were to refuse the suit of the Crimeans.
The Washington hawks still hope to force Putin
to intervene militarily, as it would give them the opportunity to isolate
Russia, turn it into a monster pariah state, beef up defense spending and
set Europe and Russia against each other.
They do not care about Ukraine and
Ukrainians, but use them as pretext to attain geopolitical goals.
No succor from the EU
The Europeans would like to fleece Ukraine; to
import its men as 'illegal' workers and its women as prostitutes, to strip
assets, to colonies. They did it with Moldova, a little sister of Ukraine,
the most miserable ex-Soviet Republic.
As for Russia, the EU would not mind taking it
down a notch, so they would not act so grandly. But the EU is not fervent
about it. Hence, the difference in attitudes.
Putin would prefer to continue with his
modernization of Russia. The country needs it badly. The infrastructure lags
20 or 30 years behind the West.
Tired by this backwardness, young Russians often
prefer to move to the West, and this brain drain causes much damage to
Russia while enriching the West.
Even Google is a result of this brain drain, for
Sergey Brin is a Russian immigrant as well.
So are hundreds of thousands of
Russian scientists and artists manning every Western lab, theatre and
orchestra.
Meeting the aspirations
of Russia's young people
Political liberalization is not enough: the
young people want good roads, good schools and a quality of life comparable
to the West. This is what Putin intends to deliver.
He is doing a fine job of it. Moscow now has
free bikes and Wi-Fi in the parks like every Western European city. Trains
have been upgraded. Hundreds of thousands of apartments are being built,
even more than during the Soviet era.
Salaries and pensions have increased
seven-to-tenfold in the past decade. Russia is still shabby, but it is on
the right track. Putin wants to continue this modernization.
As for the Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states,
Putin would prefer they retain their independence, be friendly and work at a
leisurely pace towards integration a la the European Union. He does not
dream of a new empire. He would reject such a proposal, as it would delay
his modernization plans.
If the beastly neocons would not have forced his
hand by expelling the legitimate president of Ukraine and installing their
puppets, the world might have enjoyed a long spell of peace.
But then the
western military alliance under
the U.S. leadership would fall into
abeyance, U.S. military industries would lose out, and U.S. hegemony would
evaporate. Peace is not good for
the U.S. military and
hegemony-creating
media machine.
So dreams of peace in our lifetime are
likely to remain just dreams.
What will Putin do?
Putin will try to avoid sending in troops as
long as possible.
He will have to protect the two splinter provinces, but
this can be done with remote support, the way the U.S. supports the rebels
in Syria, without 'boots on the ground'.
Unless serious bloodshed on a large scale should
occur, Russian troops will just stand by, staring down the Black Guard and
other pro-regime forces.
Putin will try to find an arrangement with the
West for sharing authority, influence and economic involvement in the failed
state. This can be done through federalization, or by means of coalition
government, or even partition.
The Russian-speaking provinces of Novorossia are
those of,
-
Kharkov (industry)
-
Nikolayev (ship-building)
-
Odessa (harbour)
-
Donetsk and Lugansk (mines and industry)
-
Dnepropetrovsk (missiles and
high-tech)
-
Zaporozhe (steel)
-
Kherson (water for Crimea and ship-building),
...all of them established, built and populated by Russians.
An independent
Novorussia?
They could secede from Ukraine and form an
independent Novorossia, a mid-sized state, but still bigger than some
neighboring states. This state could join the Union State of Russia and
Belarus, and / or the Customs Union led by Russia.
The rump Ukraine could manage as it sees fit
until it decides whether or not to join its Slavic sisters in the East. Such
a set up would produce two rather cohesive and homogeneous states.
Another possibility (much less likely at this
moment) is a three-way division of the failed Ukraine:
-
Novorossia
-
Ukraine
proper
-
Galicia&Volyn
In such a case, Novorossia would be strongly
pro-Russian, Ukraine would be neutral, and Galicia strongly pro-Western.
The EU could accept this, but the U.S. probably
would not agree to any power-sharing in the Ukraine. In the ensuing
tug-of-war, one of two winners will emerge. If Europe and the U.S. drift
apart, Russia wins.
If Russia accepts a pro-Western positioning of
practically all of Ukraine, the U.S. wins.
The tug-of-war could snap and cause all-out war,
with many participants and a possible use of nuclear weapons. This is a game
of chicken. The one with stronger nerves and less imagination will remain on
the track.
Pro and Contra
It is too early to predict who will win in the
forthcoming confrontation.
For the Russian president, it is extremely
tempting to take all of Ukraine or at least Novorossia, but it is not an
easy task, and one likely to cause much hostility from the Western powers.
With Ukraine incorporated, Russian recovery from
1991 would be completed, its strength doubled, its security ensured and a
grave danger removed. Russia would become great again. People would venerate
Putin as Gatherer of Russian Lands.
However, Russian efforts to appear as a modern
peaceful progressive state would have been wasted. It would be seen as an
aggressor and expelled from international bodies.
Sanctions will bite: high tech imports may be
banned, as in the Soviet days. The Russian elites are reluctant to
jeopardize their good life. The Russian military just recently began its
modernization and is not keen to fight yet, perhaps not for another ten
years.
But if they feel cornered, if NATO moves into Eastern Ukraine, they
will fight all the same.
The Ukrainian national
interest lies with Russia
Some Russian politicians and observers believe
that Ukraine is a basket case. Its problems would be too expensive to fix.
This assessment has a 'sour grapes' aftertaste, but it is widespread.
An interesting new voice on the web, The Saker,
promotes this view.
"Let the EU and the U.S. provide for the
Ukrainians, they will come back to Mother Russia when hungry", he says.
The problem is, they will not be allowed to
reconsider. The junta did not seize power violently in order to lose it at
the ballot box.
Besides, Ukraine is not in such bad shape as
some people claim. Yes, it would cost trillions to turn it into a Germany or
France, but that's not necessary. Ukraine can reach the Russian level of
development very quickly - in union with Russia. Under the EC-IMF-NATO,
Ukraine will become a basket case, if it's not already.
The same is true for all East European ex-Soviet
states:
they can modestly prosper with Russia, as
Belarus and Finland do, or suffer depopulation, unemployment, poverty
with Europe and NATO and against Russia, vide Latvia, Hungary, Moldova,
Georgia.
It is in Ukrainian interests to join Russia in
some framework. Ukrainians understand that.
For this reason they will not be allowed to have
democratic elections.
Putin's hard choices
Simmering Novorossia has a potential to change
the game.
If Russian troops don't come in, Novorossian
rebels may beat off the Kiev offensive and embark on a counter-offensive to
regain the whole of the country, despite Putin's pacifying entreaties. Then,
in a full-blown civil war, the Ukraine will hammer out its destiny.
On a personal level, Putin faces a hard choice.
Russian nationalists will not forgive him if he
surrenders Ukraine without a fight. The U.S. and EU threaten the very life
of the Russian president, as their sanctions are hurting Putin's close
associates, encouraging them to get rid of or even assassinate the President
and improve their relations with the mighty West.
War may come at any time, as it came twice
during the last century - though Russia tried to avoid it both times. Putin
wants to postpone it, at the very least, but not at any price.
Putin's choice is not an easy one. As Russia
procrastinates, as the U.S. doubles the risks, the world draws nearer to the
nuclear abyss.
Who will chicken out?
