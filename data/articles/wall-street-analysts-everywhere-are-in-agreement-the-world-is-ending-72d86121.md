Dont they know its the End of the world?
If you like your Wall Street analysis with a
heavy dollop of rapture and Armageddon, today was the day for you. Blame the
weighty issues of the day (Europe, mostly), and yesterdays big selloff for
the spasm of bearishness.
It started off with Nomuras Bob Janjuah.
He
said that any talk of the ECB saving Europe was a mere pipedream, and that
if
the ECB did go whole-hog buying up peripheral debt to suppress yields,
then that would prompt a German departure from the Eurozone.
Germany appears to be adamant that full
political and fiscal integration over the next decade (nothing substantive
will happen over the short term, in my view) is the only option, and ECB
monetization is no longer possible.
I really think it is that clear and simple. And
if I am wrong, and the ECB does a U-turn and agrees to unlimited
monetization, I will simply wait for the inevitable knee-jerk rally to fade
before reloading my short risk positions.
Even if Germany and the ECB somehow agree to
unlimited monetization I believe it will do nothing to fix the insolvency
and lack of growth in the Eurozone. It will just result in a major
destruction of the ECBâ€Ÿs balance sheet which will force an ECB recap. At
that point, I think Germany and its northern partners would walk away.
Markets always want short, sharp, simple solutions.
But then there was Deutsche Banks Jim Reid, who
is always sober, but not usually wildly negative.
He offered up one of the most bearish lines in
history in regards to German opposition to ECB debt monetization:
If you
dont think Merkels tone will change then our investment advice is to dig a
hole in the ground and hide.
But it got even wilder with the latest from SocGens Dylan Grice. Again, hes always pretty negative, but he cranked it
up a notch, comparing Germanys policy today against the policies that
enabled the rise of Hitler.
Specifically, he said that post-Weimar, Germany
became too aggressive about fighting inflation, thus prompting deflation,
thus prompting more unemployment, thus enabling the rise of the Nazis:
George Goncalves writes US and Europe: At the
Point of No Return?
we were wrong in assuming one could be
optimistic around the EU policy process and have learned our lesson not
to accept apathy as a sign that all is factored in as its clear downside
risks remain.
In fact, we could be approaching the point
of no return for the fate of the euro, the European financial system and
more broadly the concept of a singular economic zone for Europe; this
obviously would change the path for the US and the global economy in a
heartbeat too.
We still believe there is time to prevent
worst-case scenarios, but these sort of watershed moments reveal one
thing, that market practitioners are ill-equipped to navigate the
political process, especially one that is driven by 17 different
governments.

Currency Wars in EU commence
Britain will soon be forced to scrap the pound
and join the euro, one of Germanys most senior figures said yesterday.
In a chilling threat to UK sovereignty, German
finance minister Wolfgang Schauble predicted that all Europe would one day
use the single currency.
It will happen perhaps faster than some in
the British Isles currently believe, he said.
His sinister warning followed the emergence of
a
secret German plan to build a powerful new economic government for the Eurozone and block an EU referendum in Britain.
A leaked German foreign ministry memo detailed
plans for a new European Monetary Fund.
It also claimed the EUs treaty
could be altered to centralize more power without triggering a vote. In a
further sign of growing German supremacy within the EU, David Cameron was
yesterday rebuffed by Chancellor Angela Merkel in talks over how to tackle
the euro crisis.
Last night British opponents of the EU were
horrified by the bellicose threat to Britains economic independence.
Tory MP Peter Bone said:
I would be happy to have a bet with the
German finance minister that the Euro will disappear before the pound.
It is a completely absurd suggestion that will never happen.

The 2nd Battle of Britain
Sir John Major has warned that a Franco-German
plan to introduce a financial transaction tax across Europe was akin to
directing a heat-seeking missile at the City of London.
Hours after David Cameron failed to persuade
Angela Merkel to drop the idea of such a Tobin tax in the EU, the former
prime minister highlighted deep British unease over the issue by accusing
Paris and Berlin of fanning the flames of Euro-skepticism. Britain would be
able to veto the introduction of the tax in the EU because all taxation
matters have to be agreed by all 27 members of the EU.
But France and Germany would be able to use what
are known as enhanced co-operation powers under the Lisbon treaty to
introduce the tax in the 17 members of the Eurozone.
Britain objects to this because the tax - 0.1%
on stock and bond trades and 0.01% on derivatives - could still apply in the
City.
Merkel made clear in their discussions that she will give no ground on
a key British recommendation, that the European Central Bank should act as
the lender of last resort for the Eurozone.
