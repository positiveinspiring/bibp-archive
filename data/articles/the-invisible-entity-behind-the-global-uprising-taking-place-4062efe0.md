These perfectly coordinated
uprisings happening
across the world have something in common.
They are
occurring in countries that have rulers who have declared themselves
lifetime rulers, with high unemployment among the youth. Take Egypt, for
example, many think this was propagated by the group "Anonymous" and April 6
Youth Movement, using Facebook. To a certain extent, that is true.
However, who is behind the curtain?
All these governments were once
supported by the West, and Egypt specifically, has even been receiving
financial assistance by the billions of dollars from the U.S.
This report
from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) shows distribution of foreign
aid to various countries.
See page 18 on "Foreign
Aid - An Introductory Overview of U.S. Programs and Policy".
Sign Of The Times
To answer the question as to whom is behind the curtain during all these
protests, look no further than the signs.
Why are all these signs written in English? How
is it that these non-English speaking countries display signs in perfectly
written English?
No grammatical errors, no incorrect tenses, no
misspellings whatsoever, yet in English-speaking countries where the locals
make their own signs, it is not unusual to see signs that have errors on
them. There is no doubt that those signs are done by professionals, and it
would be reasonable to reach the deduction that covert agents from the West
have a hand in these uprisings. Stay with me on this one.
In the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s 90s and beyond Y2K, governments in the West used
economic hitmen to bring foreign governments to their knees.
John Perkins, a former economic hitman
explains in detail how they do what they do:

Here is how it works:
A third world nation receives a loan from a
developed nation. The loan is so big, there is no way the third world
country can pay it back without defaulting. When the third world country
defaults, the developed nation offers to re-finance the debt with
pre-conditions attached to it.
The most common pre-conditions are the third
world country agrees to let the lender take over its natural resources
like oil, gold and other minerals.
The contractors responsible for building the
infrastructure are owned by the developed country; or the country in
debt offers to send its troops to war zones where there are never-ending
wars.
In essence leaders of countries entrapped in the debt cycle that
is carefully orchestrated by the developed country, become their useful
puppets.
What happens is in such countries is that all
the national assets and treasures are sold off to privately owned foreign
entities. Institutions like schools, insurance corporations, electric and
utility companies and so forth end up in the hands of foreigners.
Third world countries that are rich in minerals
end up getting pimped by their leaders for their natural resources and
institutions, leaving the citizens in abject poverty, while only a handful
of people in power at the very top of the pyramid benefit financially. Most
people in third world countries cannot figure out why their rulers sell of
national assets, I hope the video above answers those questions.
Citizens of those countries get the bread-crumbs while their leaders and
foreign masters have all the milk and honey.
Native citizens of these indebted countries end
up becoming homeless in the very countries their forefathers built, and are
treated like slaves by foreigners, because their leaders sold them out to
foreign multi-national co-operations.
Where is the justice?
People are now waking up to the reality that they will be enslaved in their
own countries by the autocratic leaders who are getting rich and fat while
their fellow countrymen are starving.
The West in now allowing their former puppets to
be disposed of, so they can usher in a new generation.
The old guard cannot fight back by spraying
bullets into demonstrators because eventually they will be tried for crimes
against humanity. They cannot stay and try to negotiate their way into being
given more time to correct the wrongs, because most of them have been in
power for decades, and their failure to deliver on their promises is
inexcusable.
They were all intentionally corrupted in the 80s and 90s by the economic
hitmen who sensed greed in them, and those same vices are the ones that are
being held against them as they are now being ousted from power. When
someone has a blemished record that person can easily be manipulated.
The people in that person's immediate circle can
also be manipulated because they too have been compromised by those in the
top tier. That's the reason why after these regimes have been toppled, the
entire parliament and cabinet is dissolved and nullified to ensure that
remnants of the former regime are completely cleaned out and replaced.
Even the House of Saud has become extremely nervous because Saudis have now
awakened and organized their "Day of Anger" for March 11. The royal house is
now
giving out $32 billion dollars to Saudis, in hopes that these monies
will silence them.
Saudis will have to weigh the benefits of either cleaning house, or being
stuck with the same politicians for the rest of their lives. America,
Britain and France will stand by and watch just as they have been doing, as
nations plunge into chaos.
I believe the West is now taking sides with the
people, that's why they refused to rescue Egypt their strong ally, and are
not intervening with Jordan and recently the House of Saud.
-
Remember Kuwait? The U.S. was quick to
defend that small country to protect its oil.
-
Why didn't the U.S. step in to protect
Egypt?
-
Why is it not intervening with Jordan or
Libya?
-
Libya has one of the largest oil
reserves in the world even greater than Iraq, so why would America
just stand by, yet Libya is no longer considered a rogue state?
-
Why are they allowing the March 11
uprising to take place in Saudi Arabia when the House of Saud has
been the US' biggest ally in the Middle East?
The answer is simple. A new generation cannot be ushered in as long as
you still have the old guards on their thrones who plan to rule for life.
They are now being disposed of to make room for those whom this shadow
entity perceives will embrace their global initiatives, as opposed to
self-serving dictators.
With rulers declaring themselves lifetime presidents, they are making
themselves targets. Mubarak at 82 was not satisfied with the decades he was
in power and
the wealth he had accumulated. He still wanted to run for
president in September. If only he had stepped down on New Year's Day 2011,
he would still be living in Egypt and would be considered a national
treasure by Egyptians and a war hero.
Instead they now want him extradited so they can
try him like a common thief.
Uprisings or Secession
Could Happen In Dictatorships
If Gadhafi had also stepped down on the day of his 40th anniversary, he too
would not be dealing with what he is facing now. He would probably be the richest retired man in
Africa.
Bashir of Sudan is perhaps the brightest of all, he has declared
that this will be his last term in office. Gadhafi's talk of uniting African
nations into a United States of Africa got him in trouble, because it showed
he wasn't about leave office, so now he finds himself in a situation where
he could possibly be a man without a country.
Gadhafi's dream of a United States of Africa was
very unrealistic because Africa is plagued with tribalism. Tribalism is
worse than racism because it is perpetrated by people of the same race and
nation against one another regardless of whether they have the same skin
color.
Because the cancer of tribalism plagues Africa, we've seen nations like
Somaliland seceding from Somalia on May 18, 1991 and declaring their
independence. In 1993, following a UN-supervised referendum in Eritrea, the
Eritrean people voted overwhelmingly for independence from Ethiopia, and
Eritrea gained international recognition as a sovereign state.
On February 7, 2011, 99 percent of South
Sudanese voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence and have chosen July
9, 2011 as the date to celebrate their independence.
Tribes are either seeking secession singularly
or are banding together collectively and divorcing themselves from the
oppressive nations, as they seek to be a free and independent people.
Since dictators appear oblivious to voices that are being oppressed, I
believe they will experience either uprisings and demonstrations, or the
oppressed will seek secession from the oppressors and we will see more new
countries being formed as a result of breaking away from the original
nations they were once a part of.
Heck, even Texas over here threatened to secede
because of ObamaCare, and later on sued the government for imposing a
health care plan that Texans found unacceptable.
Governor
Rick Perry started it all when
ObamaCare angered him, and now several organizations are promoting
it. (pop-up)
I predict that the next decade will be a decade of secession in oppressed
and troubled nations rather than of unification, if their leaders continue
with their tyranny against the citizens.
The tide has now turned and a new day is
dawning.
