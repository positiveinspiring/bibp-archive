Fall Of The Republic documents how an
offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the US economy by design. Leaders
are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will
be replaced by a new global currency.
President
Obama has brazenly violated Article 1 Section 9 of the US
Constitution by seating himself at the head of
United Nations' Security
Council, thus becoming the first US president to chair the world body.
A scientific dictatorship is in its final stages of completion, and laws
protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide; an iron curtain
of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
A worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite is
implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human
activity and establish a system of neo-feudal slavery.
The image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the world's savior; he is
the Trojan Horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan.
This film reveals the architecture of the
New World Order and what the power
elite have in store for humanity. More importantly it communicates how We
The People can retake control of our government, turn the criminal tide and
bring the tyrants to justice.
A film by Alex Jones.
