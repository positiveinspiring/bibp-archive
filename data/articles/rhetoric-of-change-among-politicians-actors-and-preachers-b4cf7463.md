The rhetoric of change is a continual theme
among politicians, actors, and preachers who really know little about the
real meaning of change, nor do they want to.
Clinton and
Obama preached the
same message of change, but what has really changed in terms of anything
good? Much of the New Age rhetoric has always been one of an awakening and
right now there is a big focus about a change that will occur in
2012.
There has been an increasing amount of pressure that has been rising up
against just about everything, but there is a particular current against new
agers and against firebrands like Jesse Ventura and Alex Jones. Some throw
conspiracies against the conspiracy-warning crowd accusing them of spinning
messages that create anger, hope, and the subliminal message to rise up and
fight against the establishment.
It all can get kind of confusing after a
while, leading to ambiguity, indecision, and depression through inaction.
If one is not centered deeply inside oneself and centered in love, one is
vulnerable in a mental sense. Thats a nice way of saying we become like
sitting ducks to any higher well-organized power that is exerting great
amounts of resources to shape life according to some selfish design. We are
vulnerable to the message of change because its obvious that change is
urgently needed across a broad front but we are deceived, and that hurts.
Though there is a lot to be angry about!
But anger, except for short bursts
that propel one to action for some very good reason, is not productive and
does not usually lead to any kind of significant change except in ones
health status and I dont mean that in a positive sense.
Anger though is one
of the most honest emotions and I have written about this extensively in my
book
HeartHealth.
The bible talks about the kind of change that comes from renewing ones mind
but that is best executed through opening up the heart to the deeper
currents of love and to devotion to the higher beings that line the heavens.
That was the American Indian way of relating to the divine.
Certainly I am
not talking about aliens here, the ones I am hearing increasingly about. Not
the ones who are supposedly
manipulating governments and the elite with
their gifts of technology, wealth and power. I would not trust them as far
as I could spit even if they arrived in a UFO at my front door.
I did trust Mary though when she knocked hard at the door of my heart. I do
trust myself but only in the context of service to something higher, in
service to my family and in service to humanity as a whole.
The one thing that a person can change in this mad mad world of ours is
oneself and that comes slowly and only with time and it begins with the
willingness to see oneself as one actually is, and then change. This takes
ego penetration, which is something our egos resist with all their might. It
is in reality the real purpose of life, to penetrate ones own ego thus
getting to the truth of ones own essence or state of being.
The main point I am making is the truth does set us free, at least to a
certain extent.
My greatest hope about people who communicate the truth,
like I believe Jesse does, is that it at least unchains peoples minds so
they can break free from the constant propaganda that the higher-ups put out
in the mass media.
The movie
The Matrix was no joke and mirrored quite
accurately the current state of the mainstream.
We can pick up many truths that are happening around the globe from the
mainstream media, but at the same time we have to accept the hugely
penetrating mental manipulation that is a zero sum game in terms of real
change.
The press has the world pouring out its empathy and compassion for
those killed in Arizona but will not spend a word on the children killed by
the poisons in vaccines because there is no proof of that.
Misplaced Tears?
The youngest victim of the Tucson shootings, Christina-Taylor Green, was
buried amid an outpouring of grief but where is the grief for all the men,
women, and children being buried by contemporary medicine?
Though this
subject has not been on President Obamas wifes mind, she posted an open
letter on the White House web site that said:
As parents, an event like
this hits home especially hard. It makes our hearts ache for those who lost
loved ones. It makes us want to hug our own families a little tighter. And
it makes us think about what an event like this says about the world we live
in - and the world in which our children will grow up.
So how about it Mr. and Mrs. of the White House? How about some grief for
the victims of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster? Have you forgotten
completely about them?
I am reading how coastal residents who have their
complaints about health problems they allegedly suffered from exposure to
dispersants and toxins while helping clean up oil from
the BP spill in the
Gulf are being dismissed as unproven
by these men.
William K. Reilly, Bob Graham, and
Donald Boesch of the National Oil Spill
Commission listened compassionately to the tearful entreaties of those who
say their suffering has been unfairly dismissed.
But in the end, the
commissioners stated,
We were charged with being evidence-driven, and the
fact is weve asked for and sought out evidence that the oil spill is the
proximate cause of these health problems, and we just havent found it.
I
never heard something so ridiculous in my entire life. But we can celebrate
at least that finally the government is beginning to admit that fluoridation
of water should be reduced because its dangerous.
Rich Beware
I was just reading from the New York Times about the rioting in Tunisia.
Just as in other protests in recent days, the demonstrators called for
President Ben Ali to step down.
But many seemed even more angry at his
second wife, Leila Trabelsi, and her family - 'No, no to the Trabelsis who
looted the budget,' has been a popular slogan - and some said they still
considered the president a good man brought down by the greed of his wife
and her clan.
Much of the anger is being directed at the wealth and at the
many mansions this family owns.
What I could not help thinking is how vulnerable many of the rich and
powerful are in the United States to an eventual uprising against their
power and wealth. Sure the richest drive around in their armored limos and
have security guards and high security fences around their homes.
But
like
these men above, there are so many of them who are playing the rich mans
game who do not have armored cars.
Prince
Charles got a taste of this and I
am sure many more will also despite everything the police and security
forces around the world can do. But perhaps they have nothing to be worried
about except for polar shifts and their houses being covered by ice age
sheets of ice.
Then the super wealthy will have to come up with something
more than just chains for their limo tires.
