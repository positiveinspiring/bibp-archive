A little help on security
from the NSA.
The National Security Agency (NSA)
has been working with Microsoft Corp. to help improve security measures for
its new Windows 7 operating system, a senior NSA official said on Tuesday.
The confirmation of the NSA's role, which began during the development of
the software, is a sign of the agency's deepening involvement with the
private sector when it comes to building defenses against cyber-attacks.
"Working in partnership with Microsoft and
(the Department of Defense), NSA leveraged our unique expertise and
operational knowledge of system threats and vulnerabilities to enhance
Microsoft's operating system security guide without constraining the
user's ability to perform their everyday tasks," Richard Schaeffer, the
NSA's Information Assurance Director, told the Senate Judiciary
Committee in a statement prepared for a hearing held this morning in
Washington.
"All this was done in coordination with the
product release, not months or years later in the product cycle."
The partnership between the NSA and Microsoft is
not new.
In 2007, NSA officials acknowledged working with Microsoft during the
development of Windows Vista to 'help' boost its defenses against
computer viruses, worms and other attacks. In fact, the cooperation dates
back to at least 2005, when the NSA and other government agencies worked
with Microsoft on its Windows XP system and other programs.
The NSA, which is best known for its electronic eavesdropping operations,
is charged with protecting the nation's national security computing
infrastructure from online assaults.
As these systems become increasingly dependent on private-sector computing
products, the NSA has reached out to a growing number of software companies.
"More and more, we find that protecting
national security systems demands teaming with public and private
institutions to raise the information assurance level of products and
services more broadly," Schaeffer said.
Schaeffer said that the NSA is also working to
engage other companies, including Apple, Sun, and RedHat, on security
standards for their products. The agency also works with computer security
firms such as Symantec, McAfee, and Intel.
A growing array of law enforcement authorities, intelligence officials, and
private computer experts has been warning about the rising threat of
cyberattacks.
"The FBI considers the cyber threat against
our nation to be one of the greatest concerns of the 21st
century," Steven Chabinksy, the deputy assistant director of the FBI's
cyber division, told the same congressional committee.
The Obama administration has been under pressure
to name a cybersecurity chief to reinvigorate the government's efforts to
protect its most sensitive computer networks. Some press reports suggest
that appointment could come as early as next week.

The text of Schaeffer's testimony, as prepared
for delivery, is now online here.
Update at 2 p.m. ET
The NSA and other cybersecurity experts say that
simple precautions (such as installing system updates regularly and running
anti-virus software and firewalls) should protect against about 80% of the
attacks out there.
This means that if users took these steps, the
NSA and others could focus on the more dangerous 20%, or so the theory
goes. Put another way, of course, that means about 20% of attacks are
sophisticated enough to theoretically defeat standard security measures.
