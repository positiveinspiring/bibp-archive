The European Union is terrorizing voters in
Switzerland and threatening retaliation against the tiny nation, which is
not in the EU, after the Swiss voted on February 9 to limit immigration in a
national referendum.
Amid outrageous verbal attacks on the Swiss themselves
- senior EU officials have been suggesting that "xenophobia" was behind the
vote - out-of-touch European politicians and bureaucrats are even warning
that Switzerland could lose its current bilateral access to the "common
market" ruled by the
emerging super-state in Brussels.
The EU, famous for
ignoring the public to impose its will, has already started adopting the
"consequences" promised by its apparatchiks.
According to news reports, the
unaccountable regime just suspended talks with Switzerland on incorporating
Swiss utilities into the broader European energy market.
"No technical
negotiations on the electricity agreement are foreseen between Switzerland
and the EU at the moment in light of the new situation," European Commission
spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde-Hansen announced to reporters in Brussels on
February 11. More pain has been promised.
With the neutral Alpine nation facing a
tsunami of immigrants from Europe who do not share their generally
liberty-minded values and culture, concerns over unrestricted immigration
under bilateral treaties finally came to a boil this year.
Already, some 25
percent of the population is foreign born - about two thirds of that total
come from EU nations - and many native Swiss people have long felt that the
nation was losing its culture.
With Switzerland's
freer economy leaving the EU in the dust in terms of growth, wages,
wealth, innovation, and employment, the influx of foreigners showed no signs
of easing.
In response to the situation, the center-right
Swiss People's Party (SVP), the nation's largest, organized the referendum
to seek public input on the issue - a common occurrence in Switzerland,
where the people get the final say if they want it. Voters narrowly decided
that curbs on immigration were needed, with 50.3 percent voting to scrap a
2002 deal with the EU allowing "free movement" of people across the borders.
A majority of cantons also backed the proposal. The Swiss federal
government, which opposed the limits before the vote, will reluctantly begin
implementing a quota system sometime this year in accordance with the
referendum result.
Foreign ministers from formerly sovereign
nations across Europe, whose governments continue to impose more
"integration" and unaccountable governance on the peoples of the bloc
without their consent, lambasted the Swiss decision.
Multiple officials even
claimed infinite immigration was somehow a "sacred principle" for Europe.
Ironically, however, all across the controversial bloc,
liberty-minded parties seeking to put the brakes on unlimited mass
immigration are soaring in the polls. From France and the United Kingdom
to the Netherlands and beyond, European voters are becoming
increasingly weary of what critics say is a power-hungry regime with
totalitarian tendencies in Brussels.
In response to the growing outrage over the EU
and unrestricted immigration, top EU commissars have increasingly resorted
to Saul Alinsky-style tactics to attack their opponents.
Among other
strategies, extremist European "integration" zealots, who now
openly declare their intention to build a "United
States of Europe" after decades denying it, have resorted to demonizing
the public they supposedly work for. Former EU Commissioner and Attorney
General Peter Sutherland, for instance, claimed opponents and even skeptics
of smashing national sovereignty were somehow extremists and racists.
After the latest Swiss vote, in between open
threats, top European politicians made similar suggestions, sounding like
petulant children.
"Switzerland has rather damaged itself with this result,"
claimed German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier after arriving in
Brussels, even as demands grow for a similar referendum in Germany.
"Switzerland must realize that cherry-picking with the EU is not a long-term
strategy."
In other words, voters - even those who have consistently
rejected the EU - must have no say about the march toward
total EU domination of Europe.
Other foreign ministers made similarly
outrageous remarks threatening tiny Switzerland - among the freest and most
prosperous societies in the world and consistently ranked number one on just
about every metric.
"There will be consequences, that's clear," warned
Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, coming off more like a
schoolyard bully than a respectable public servant.
"You can't have privileged access to the
European internal market and on the other hand, dilute free
circulation."
Irish Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore, meanwhile,
took the hysteria a step further, calling the result of the Swiss people's
vote "very disturbing."
Of course, the obligatory smears of millions of
Swiss citizens and EU subjects could not be avoided, either.
"I think we
have seen throughout Europe a growth in what I can only call an
extreme-right agenda which is quite xenophobic," Gilmore told reporters,
using a typical tactic employed by totalitarians throughout history.
Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius with the
Socialist French government said the decision by Swiss voters was a "worrying" development, which he claimed showed that Switzerland - famous
for international trade - was somehow "withdrawing" into itself.
"We're
going to review our relations with Switzerland," Fabius said during a radio
program.
Top EU bosses made similar remarks vowing to retaliate against the
Swiss for standing up to their demands and wild fear mongering. The bloc
surrounds Switzerland on all sides.
Swiss officials, meanwhile, while acknowledging
that they are bound by the public's decision, tried to downplay the
hysterical talk coming out of politicians and bureaucrats in Brussels and
European capitals. Big business interests - business-friendly Switzerland
hosts international or regional headquarters for numerous major global
corporations fleeing bloated welfare regimes - lamented the decision, saying
it would be harder for companies to recruit the talent needed to grow.
The
public, however, concerned about what critics of unrestricted immigration
say is the ongoing destruction of Swiss culture, were willing to take the
risks.
While the establishment and its mouthpieces
slammed the decision, liberty-minded analysts celebrated it.
"There is
surely no doubt that Switzerland, as one of two remaining important Western
republics, continues to offer a challenge to those who seek aggressive
globalism," noted the free market-oriented Daily Bell.
"Switzerland's carefully preserved culture
and free-market virtues are ever a challenge to those who want to break
down the borders of nation-states in order to create an evolving,
expansive internationalism. But now - finally - Switzerland has pushed
back."
As The New American reported in 2011,
EU bullying of tiny Switzerland and its voters has been a persistent and
ongoing problem.
Despite not being a member of the
sovereignty-crushing regime, bloated high-tax EU member governments and
Brussels itself were demanding Swiss voters raise taxes as companies and
capital fled the bloc to lower-taxed, liberty-oriented cantons across
Switzerland. Since then, the outrageous threats and coercion have only
accelerated, with the EU treating Swiss voters as subjects required to
comply with Brussels' decrees.
The super-state's "war"
on Switzerland continues.
Of course, the
Obama administration has been
terrorizing Swiss voters
for years as well. Using a combination of
threats and intimidation, the U.S. government ultimately succeeded in
forcing Switzerland to obey its decrees on banking secrecy, data sharing,
and more.
Numerous tax-funded international outfits such as the OECD have
also been scheming to crush Swiss freedom and sovereignty under the guise of
helping revenue-hungry politicians around the world extract more tribute
from citizens.
While what little public support existed for the
EU
continues to evaporate across the region, political parties seeking to
exit the controversial union and restore national sovereignty
are dominating at the polls across much of the bloc.
However, so-called "eurocrats" and the establishment behind the radical project are unlikely to
abandon their decades-old dream of a Europe ruled by an unaccountable and
unelected behemoth - at least not any time soon.
Swiss voters, though, would be wise to continue
standing up against the
flailing bully as it
implodes from within.
