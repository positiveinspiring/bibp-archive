The powers of the magical age are many and one of the reasons why the seventh ray is now making its appearance is that, owing to the rapid perfecting and integration of the human personality, the higher integration between soul and personality is today more possible and more easily accomplished than ever before. The new forms, through which that much desired consummation can be affected, must be consequently gradually and scientifically developed. This, as you may well conceive, will be achieved through the intensification of the forces, functioning through the etheric body, through the coordination of the seven major centers, and the establishing of their rhythmic relationship. The seventh ray governs predominantly upon the etheric levels of [118] the physical plane. It does not govern the dense physical form which is under the control of the third ray. It is the vital or the etheric body which is responsive to and developed by the incoming seventh ray influences.
