Using data from shootingtracker.com, PBS recently updated a map which documents all of the mass shootings that occurred in the United States in 2015. They define mass shootings as,
"incidents when at least four people are killed or wounded, including the gunman."
Its a pretty disturbing sight.
This type of gun violence seems particular to the United States, and the numbers really do call into question the laxity of gun laws in this country.
Another relevant statistic to mention here is the fact that America has four percent of the worlds population, yet still carries approximately twenty five percent of the worlds prison population (though thats an entirely different can of worms that you can read about here, if interested).
These mass shootings have significant consequences, not only for the victims and their families, but for every other citizen in the country.
The fear these incidents create enables governments to impose a heightened national security state on a willing population, which in turn leads to the diminishment of many of their hard-earned rights.
We saw this happen here in Canada with Bill C-51, which gave The Canadian Security Intelligence Services (CSIS) more power to stop terrorist activities. We lost many freedoms in exchange.
More people are starting to wake up and connect dots between terrorism and government control, however.
The idea of false flag terrorism is becoming common knowledge, and people are beginning to recognize that these so-called terrorist attacks are a creation of the Western military alliance.
This means that the countries that are supposedly fighting these groups, like the United States, are the same countries funding them.
"We are dealing with a criminal undertaking at a global level... and there is an ongoing war, it is led by the United States, it may be carried out by a number of proxy countries, which are obeying orders from Washington... The global war on terrorism is a US undertaking, which is fake, its based on fake premises. It tells us that somehow America and the Western world are going after a fictitious enemy, the Islamic state, when in fact the Islamic state is fully supported and financed by the Western military alliance and Americas allies in the Persian Gulf... They say Muslims are terrorists, but it just so happens that terrorists are Made in America. Theyre not the product of Muslim society, and that should be abundantly clear to everyone on this floor... The global war on terrorism is a fabrication, a big lie and a crime against humanity." (source)

The quote above comes from prominent author and Canadian economist Dr. Michel Chossudovsky, who is the University of Ottawas Emeritus Professor of Economics.
He shared his views at the International Conference on the New World Order, which was organized and sponsored by the Perdana Global Peace Foundation.
Here below is a great video discussing the origins of ISIS that you wont hear from the Western media.
People are also starting to wonder if some of these mass shootings and other incidents in the U.S., including domestic terror events like the Boston Bombings, have been fabricated as well.
For example, Steven Segal recently expressed his belief that these shootings are "engineered" by the government. Considering his connection to domestic and foreign governments, this was pretty revelatory.
You can see more about that story:
"I believe that, I hate to say this, a lot of these mass murders and all this funny stuff thats going on, I believe a lot of this is engineered." (source)
"I believe that, I hate to say this, a lot of these mass murders and all this funny stuff thats going on, I believe a lot of this is engineered."
This of course leads one to ask, why would such events be engineered?
The answer is simple:
to greatened a heightened state of fear to justify the passing of certain bills and heighten the national global security state to create a New World Order.
This isnt just conjecture.
There is plenty of evidence to support these claims with regards to both terrorism and mass shootings. I am not going to go into detail at this time, but I do not think it is at all ridiculous to entertain the idea that at least some of these events are manufactured.
If this conflicts with your belief system, thats okay.
As the saying goes,
"Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance."
We need to be open to the possibility that things are not as they seem.
Personally, after having researched false flag terrorism for many years, I believe many of the mass shootings that occur in the United States are indeed fabricated, used as an ideological weapon against a manufactured enemy.
If you were to have suggested something like this a couple of years ago, you would have been deemed completely nuts.
Today, however, more people have the courage to ask these kinds of difficult questions and do the necessary research to answer them. The bottom line is that these false flag operations require complete control over global media, which could be one explanation for why we keep hearing opposing explanations for various phenomena.
Russia and the United States are a great example of this, with both outlets in those countries completely contradicting themselves.
