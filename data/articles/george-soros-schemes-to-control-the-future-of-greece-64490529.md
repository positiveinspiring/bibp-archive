The Berggruen Institute
on Governance sees itself as an independent think tank which
develops practicable solutions for the political systems of the 21st
century.
The functioning of the
Institute: It brings outstanding public figures and people, the
Governments work first hand and know my own practical experience
with the most successful entrepreneurs and the most important
intellectual thought leaders in the world together.
You make councils,
Councils, which meet regularly and engage in the long term. Their
common goal is to develop a baseline for the challenges of todays
Government work, to discuss, to submit concrete proposals for
action, and to accompany the process.
Soros, a Hungarian-American business
magnate, is the chairman of Soros Fund Management. and supports
progressive-liberal causes.
He is known as The Man Who Broke the Bank
of England.
The Berggruen Institute on Governance is
under the direction of
Nicolas Berggruen, a jet setting billionaire who
is working tirelessly to bring about the Progressive Movement into
mainstream, to destroy the very fabric of independence and liberty.
