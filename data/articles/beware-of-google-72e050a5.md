The brains behind Google
Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt &
Larry Page
Multiple convergent devices are an inescapable
reality in modern life.
In my case, (which is not unusual), I have a
laptop computer, a desktop computer and a mobile smart phone. All these
devices can surf the net, play music and videos, process email and work on
documents.
This is great but it does raise the question:
How do you synchronize all your files so
that:
-
you're not editing an out of date
document
-
you have access to those new
bookmarks in your browser
-
you've got the same emails on your
cell phone that you have on your desktop?
You can try maintaining multiple versions of
your data and institute a rigorous regime of synchronization, but really,
that's got knobs on it.
The only realistic way to manage the problem is
with a single centralized copy of the stuff that is accessible at all times,
from all locations. And where is that central location?
Well, it's a no brainer: on some internet
server, or, as Google like to put it: "on the Cloud".
Cloud computing is such a cogent solution to such a pressing problem
that everyone is moving their data there. And not only their data. Since the
data is online, it makes sense that the applications should be browser
based.
Interestingly, in this manner the tyranny of
incompatible operating systems can be broken. No longer is the operating
system the controlling specification. Now it is little more than the support
system for a web browser.
Since all browsers use the same HTML
specification it matters not whether you are running Symbian, MacOS, Linux
or Windows, it all works the same once you are in your browser.
Cloud Computing
Everything on the Cloud!
Google have known all this for years of course,
and have taken steps to position themselves as the main player in the cloud
computing game.
Google's products to exploit this direction
include:
-
Google Mail
A browser based email client and cloud
based email storage. Since it is free, unlimited, reliable and
intuitive, a large percentage of the world's email traffic goes
through Google. They know more about you than you know about
yourself.
-
Google Docs
A browser based set of "Office" apps
with cloud based data storage. Again, a free, reliable, easy to use
suite of apps that encourage collaboration. A perfect turnkey
solution for any IT manager in any business. It works and it's
free!!! Can't argue with that!
As more businesses switch to Google Apps
for ALL their documents, Google becomes the repository of the
greatest number of company secrets in the world!!!
-
Google Chrome
A multi-platform, high-performance
browser which provides the front end for Google's various solutions.
The system parameters and (in theory at least) your bookmarks are
stored on the cloud. A lovely browser.
When you use it Google stores an
ENORMOUS amount of data about you and your business.
-
Google Chrome OS
A multi-platform operating system built
purely to support their web browser. This will shut out any
competition at any level. If this gets major acceptance Google
will own every aspect of computing except the hardware.
Of course Google also have numerous other
products that further help them to maintain an unfair advantage and dominate
the world.
Google defeated the giant Microsoft, (who WERE
the arrogant monopolist kings), some time ago, an achievement many of us
applauded, since we
hated Microsoft so deeply, but the
degree of domination Google has in mind is FAR greater than that planned by
Microsoft.
Google wish to control every piece of
software in the world AND all the storage, and through this, to have
access to ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE WORLD!!!
The amount of knowledge possessed by Google
ALREADY is far and beyond anything previously considered and is not far from
the level of omniscience normally ascribed to that mythical deity commonly
referred to as God! The amount of power following such
knowledge is quite staggering.
Currently it is used merely to make money, but
in the future who knows? They say that power corrupts after all...
Google's methodology is simple:
They GIVE you a quality product for
nothing. It might even be the BEST product. You pay nothing!
How can you argue with that? I use Google
products myself: lots of them!
In return for their software, Google has access
your information:
Google are able to SELL this information,
(although not in its raw state), to people that want it.
The price is not cheap and Google are
fantastically wealthy as a result.
Google Headquarters Google
Headquarters
Google Headquarters, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California,
USA.
Yes! Hats off to the brilliant men behind this
company who thought it up and made it work. Kudos!
But now they must be stopped. It has got beyond
the joke.
We cannot allow one company such power. Remember
Microsoft? Who can imagine the amount of corruption possible with such
knowledge and control? Already we are starting to see that Google are not
above slimy activities: Remember the harvesting of MAC IDs by the Google
Maps car? This is merely the visible piece of the iceberg.
Even if Google were to observe an exemplary moral code, global
domination by their products would still be bad.
In the past Google's products were amazingly bug
free, efficient and intuitive, however, I have noticed in recent months a
growing degradation in all aspects of their output.
There are silly elements creeping into their
user interfaces and glaring omissions. (For example: where is the "Street
View" button in Google Maps? It should be next to the satellite button but
it isn't).
There are bugs creeping into their applications
and some features that simply don't work, a situation unthinkable only a
year or 2 ago. (For example: "Chrome Sync" doesn't work properly, despite
having been around for some time). Finally there are non-negotiable data
constraints being imposed by Google that may NOT be in your best interests.
(For example: no hierarchical folders in Gmail).
Imagine what would happen if Google's huge
databases stopped working!!! Imagine if your business were entirely
committed to Google Docs. Just think about that for a minute...
The only way to reduce corruption and arrogance and to manage the risk of
software incompetence and wide-scale data failure is to maintain a healthy
variety of competitive vendors, each offering something different and to
prevent total vertical integration as pursued by the likes of Google.
So what can we do to stop it?
Well, to begin with we can encourage governments
and legal institutions to use anti-monopoly and anti-competitive powers to
limit the scope of some of Google's operations. For the time being at least,
governments, (China for example), are still more powerful than the behemoth
and they should be encouraged to act while they still can.
More importantly (and more immediately) though,
there are things that we can do on our own:
Essentially we can reduce our use of Google
products, which will have the effect of reducing the information, money
and power available to Google and give their competitors some fuel and
oxygen.
This doesn't mean that we should suddenly all
switch to the Yahoo-Microsoft axis.
What we need is balance and variety. Ideally: 3
or more major players, none of which have complete vertical integration. We
the users must act to balance the ship by intelligent choice of which
products we use.
Since Google are the main player in most
internet arenas we need to bring them back to the pack.
This is easily done if the majority of users put
their mind to it:
-
Firstly and most importantly: DON'T USE
CHROME!
Chrome is the lynch-pin in Google plan
for world domination, without it they can't get full vertical
integration and will remain merely a web applications and data
storage vendor. There is no reason to use it. Firefox, Internet
Explorer, Opera and Safari are all fine browsers. Pick one,
preferably not IE though...
-
Secondly: DON'T USE GMAIL!
Much of your most personal information
is transmitted via email, don't give it Google. Yes, I know it's
good and it's free. That's how they got into their current position.
Remember that there are other free web-mail providers available or
you could even consider using a paid premium service, such as
FastMail. Other than that you can use your ISP's email or that of
your web host if you have your own domain.
-
Thirdly: Consider using a different
search engine.
Yes, I know, Google is the best search
engine. We all know that. That's why we use it! But the Google
search engine is where it all began. It is their revenue base. It is
their power base. Take it away and the company will collapse. Limit
it and you limit the power of the company. Consider using Ask.com at
least some of the time...
Hopefully you are now enlightened and see the
danger.
Let's nip this new dictator in the bud before things get right out of hand.
USE LESS GOOGLE!!!
No Chrome No Gmail
