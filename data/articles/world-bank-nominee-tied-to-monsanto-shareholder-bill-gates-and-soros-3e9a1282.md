Obama has nominated Dartmouth University
president
Jim Yong Kim, M.D. to head
the United Nations World Bank. Most people
think that UN agencies benefit poor people, but this is far from the truth.
The UN World Bank claims to fight poverty in developing nations by
financing infrastructure projects. But the UN World Bank is really a tool
used to acquire Third World natural resources through conditions on loans
that are extremely difficult to repay. The raw resources are then privatized
by insider multi-national corporations.
The World Bank actually creates more poverty.
The nomination of Jim Yong Kim indicates that the World Bank may shift away
from focusing on infrastructure and will instead turn toward providing
healthcare in Third World countries. Jim Yong Kims
areas of interest include vaccines for
tuberculosis as well as drugs for
HIV and AIDS.
Kim
brokered a deal with
Big Pharma and the UN World Health
Organization (WHO) for expanding the pharmaceutical drug market to a
larger populace in exchange for lower drug prices for second-line
tuberculosis drugs. Second-line drugs are used when basic treatment fails
because of drug resistance.
Drug resistance similar to the new resistant
White Plague brought about by big pharmas drugs.
Many in the medical community believed it would be dangerous to distribute
second-line drugs widely. Kim is also responsible for pushing HIV/AIDS
retroviral drugs in developing nations.
HIV/AIDS drugs used in the Third World have profound side effects that
include eye, kidney, liver and heart problems.
Jim Yong Kim says that the highest point in
his career was when
George Soros donated to Kims
tuberculosis vaccine program, which was followed by a a huge grant from the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for $44.7 million.
Monsanto shareholder
Bill Gates, who has repeatedly stated
that Monsantos GMOs are the answer to starvation, despite scientific
proof of the contrary, gave a controversial speech at a Ted conference
outlining the
controversial population reduction plan
through healthcare:
The world today has 6.8 billion people
thats headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on
new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower
that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
Additionally, Kim is the co-founder of Partners
in Health along with Paul Farmer who is famous for saying that
healthcare is a right.
Healthcare as a right disables health freedom
to escape the medical health paradigm and choose your own methods of
healing. In addition, it also enables the government to determine whether or
not an individual may receive care - the right to live or die.
Therefore, this shocking and
disturbing program
falls into the category of a eugenics-based plan.
Conclusion
The objective of Jim Yong Kim heading
the United Nations
World Bank appears to be to promote ludicrous policies by expanding
healthcare through dangerous drugs.
Kims support for redistribution of wealth
and socialized medicine may come with a tremendous price tag for
developed countries (especially the US).
If the UN World Bank was truly a benevolent organization, the focus for
the Third World would be on support for independent farming, clean water
and food.
