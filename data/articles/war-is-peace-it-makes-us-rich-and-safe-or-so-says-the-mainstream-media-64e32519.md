'War is Peace.'
What was known as a famous quote
from George Orwell's fiction
1984 has become a reality. Or maybe it is still fiction if
you consider that
the mainstream media is making up reality
on a daily basis.
On April 28, 2014, the homepage of The
Washington Post web site featured the picture of a nuclear explosion
with the following title:
"War
is brutal. The alternative is worse."
I wonder if people in war torn Iraq,
Afghanistan, Palestine and the likes agree.
The subtitle is probably the apex of nonsense:
"War may be the worst way imaginable to
create peaceful societies, but this professor (Ian
Morris) argues that it's the only
way."
Professor? How can you be a professor and say
something so illogical? And how can a newspaper be taken seriously when it
publishes such absurdities?
But it gets worse, if that's even possible.
Clicking on the article (click below image), you get this:
"Wars make us safer and richer".
Wow. Really?
Who's "us"? Certainly not the American people:
The decade-long American wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq would end up costing
as much as $6 trillion, the equivalent of $75,000 for every American
household, calculates the prestigious Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government
It is also imperative to recall that the Bush
administration had claimed at the very outset that the Iraq war would
finance itself out of Iraqi oil revenues, but
Washington DC had instead ended up
borrowing some $2 trillion to finance the two wars, the bulk of it
from foreign lenders.
According to the Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government 2013 report, this accounted for roughly
20 per cent of the total amount added to
the US national debt between 2001 and 2012.
According to the report, the US "has already
paid $260 billion in interest on the war
debt," and future interest
payments would amount to trillions of dollars.

US Wars in Afghanistan, Iraq to Cost $6 trillion)
So, who's "us" getting richer? The bankers
maybe?
Because if war makes some people rich, it's
the bankers:
Bankers
are often
the driving force behind war.
After all, the banking system is founded upon
the counter-intuitive but indisputable fact that banks
create loans first, and then create deposits later.
In other words, virtually all money is actually
created as debt
Debt (from the borrower's perspective) owed to
banks is profit and income from the bank's perspective. In other words,
banks are in the business of creating more
debt
i.e. finding more people who want to borrow larger sums
What does this have to do with war?
War
is the most efficient debt-creation machine
War is also good for banks because a lot of
material, equipment, buildings and infrastructure get destroyed in war. So
countries go into massive debt to finance
war, and then borrow a ton more to rebuild.
(Washington's Blog,
War Creates Massive Debt and Makes the Banks Rich)
"Us" is probably also the military industrial
complex, for which peace is enemy number one:
The fact that military
activities may become a profitable enterprise leads to the realization that
peace is the main enemy of the military-industrial complex.
A simple metaphor can illustrate this problem.
Grape growers, the wine industry and wine marketers would be completely out
of business if people stopped drinking wine.
In a similar way, the military-industrial
complex would be put out of business by lasting peaceful conditions because
the development, production, marketing and use of military equipment would
be not needed.
To stay
in business, this complex needed the wars in
Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, the "cold war" with the Soviet Union, war on
terrorism and various other wars.
And it needs to be involved in new
conflicts, such as in Ukraine at this time.
(Vashek Cervinka,
Peace is the Enemy of the US Military Industrial Complex)
WE, the people of the world, don't want wars and
WE are not getting "richer" and "safer" with wars. It's actually quite the
contrary.
Wars ruin economies and guess what? Wars kill
people! How are mass killings and massive debts making "us safer and
richer"?
Even though he received the
Stanford University Dean's Award, which,
"recognizes the efforts of exceptional
teachers in the School of Humanities and Sciences" and is "given for
excellence in graduate education" and "achievements in teaching",
...professor
Ian Morris seems to ignore the
existence of what is probably the most important judgment in the history of
mankind, The
Nuremberg Judgment, which says:
To initiate a war of aggression,
therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the
supreme
international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it
contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.
We live in a world where award-winning
Humanities and Science teachers promote war, the supreme international
crime.
It cannot get more Orwellian than that...
