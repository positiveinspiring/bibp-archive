What do,
-
Google
-
AOL
-
Skype
-
Facebook
-
Apple
-
Hotmail
-
Yahoo,
...all have in common? They have all been caught turning over private
user data to the government's spy agency,
the NSA.
All these companies
routinely turn over the emails, voice calls, text chats, photos, files and
even logins and passwords of their users, including Americans.
"There is a massive apparatus within the
United States government that with complete secrecy has been building
this enormous structure that has only one goal," journalist
Glenn Greenwald recently told Piers Morgan
(who knows all about spying and hacking people's private data).
"And that is to destroy privacy and
anonymity not just in the United States but around the world."
Tech companies rush to issue
(false) denials
Immediately after these revelations surfaced
over the past few days, all these companies began denying any involvement
with the NSA.
"Google CEO Larry Page and Facebook chief executive Mark
Zuckerberg are denying reports that depict two of the Internets most
influential companies as willing participants in a secret government program
that gives the National Security Agency unfettered access to email and other
personal information transmitted on various online services," reports the
San Francisco branch of CBS News.
But what nobody is yet revealing is that all these companies are required
by law to LIE to their own customers about secret government
surveillance.
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, you see, makes it a
federal crime for any company participating in the surveillance to publicly
acknowledge the existence of that surveillance.
Thus, executives at,
...and others would all face arrest and federal prosecution as
"terrorists" if they admitted the truth to their own users.
That's just how far down the rabbit hole this government surveillance
program goes:
Not only does the government spy on you and everything you do
- "they
quite literally can watch your ideas as you type" - the government can
also force all the tech companies cooperating with the spying to publicly
deny the existence of the program.
But the New York Times - yes, the NYT which hardly ever engages is actual
journalism - has gone public with an article confirming that these tech
companies did, indeed,
concede to the NSA surveillance program:
"They opened
discussions with national security officials about developing technical
methods to more efficiently and securely share the personal data of foreign
users in response to lawful government requests.
And in some cases, they
changed their computer systems to do so," says the NYT in an article titled
Tech Companies Concede to Surveillance Program.
Except it wasn't just "foreign users," it turns out.
The program quickly
ballooned to encompass users in the United States, too.
The NYT goes on to
report:
In at least two cases, at Google and Facebook, one of the plans discussed
was to build separate, secure portals, like a digital version of the secure
physical rooms that have long existed for classified information, in some
instances on company servers.
Through these online rooms, the government
would request data, companies would deposit it and the government would
retrieve it, people briefed on the discussions said.
This is how companies like Google and Facebook can claim,
with a straight
face, that the NSA doesn't have "backdoor access to our servers." They don't
need it!
What actually happens is that Google, Facebook, Yahoo and others
simply deposit all user data at another location - a "gateway" where the NSA copies it off.
Now you understand how to correctly parse this fake denial by Google's chief
executive Larry Page, who says,
"The U.S. government does not have direct
access or a 'back door' to the information stored in our data centers."
It doesn't need "direct access." It has
INDIRECT access that was set up by
Google!
Here's the slide from the
top secret PRISM program that tells the
truth.

How the government flipped
the script on "foreign terrorists" to "domestic threats"
All this is, of course, an outrageous abuse of
the
Patriot Act and the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).
Because when both of those were being debated on the Senate floor following
the false flag attacks of 9/11, it was promised that "this would never be
used against Americans."
Hence the name "Foreign" Intelligence Surveillance
Act. It was only about "foreigners," because they were the terrorists,
right?
But over the last decade, the U.S. government flipped the script. All of a
sudden the Obama administration was targeting "domestic threats" which it
identified as
veterans, patriots, conservatives, gun owners and anyone who believed in
the Constitution.
It didn't take long for the surveillance grid to be
redirected toward the American people.
Now, instead of FISA being used to
track Bin Laden through a network of caves in Afghanistan, it was being used
to track Bob Jones, a Kentucky farmer who owns a shotgun and carries a
Bible.
This demonstrates just how easily these unconstitutional powers can be
abused. History has shown that when the government is granted such powers,
they will always turn them against the People sooner or later.
Hence the
reason for the Fourth Amendment and the entire Bill of Rights - something
that both Bush and Obama seem to think doesn't exist.
Anyone who believes the
denials of Google and Facebook is a fool
At this point, of course, anyone who believes
the ridiculous denials of Google and Facebook is an outright fool.
Google,
for starters, has been run by spooks from the very beginning. Many of its
top engineers are straight out of the NSA. Backdoors have been in place from
its inception, just
FYI.
Google allows the government to psychologically profile all its users. By
watching what you query in the search engine, they can build a profile of
all your interests, habits, perversions and political leanings.
Gee, do you
think that could be used against you by a vindictive, criminal government
that has already been caught
using the IRS to intimidate and threaten conservative groups?
This is why more and more people are switching over to Startpage:
www.StartPage.com
It's the "no surveillance" search engine. Personally, I use Startpage for
almost all my searches - especially when I'm researching something for a
story that might get me flagged as a terrorist by the Google/NSA
surveillance grid.
For example, if I'm researching a story on the Oklahoma
City bombing, I might search for something like, "how to make a fertilizer
bomb" just to get background information on the story.
Such a search on
Google would immediately get you flagged by the NSA as a possible terrorist.
That's because journalism has been criminalized under the Obama
administration. As an example, examine how the Department of Justice
used its power to
intimidate and surveil hundreds of Associated Press reporters.
It even
accused
a Fox News reporter of being involved in a conspiracy against America
for merely asking a State Department official his opinion on an
international matter.
Collusion between tech
companies and bad government
Isn't it obvious at this point that the police
state spy grid has gotten completely out of control?
This collusion between
tech companies and abusive government has become a threat to the freedom and
safety of the American people.
Big Brother isn't merely something that might arrive in the future... it's
here! You are being tracked right now.
Everything you type, post, say or
search for is being recorded and data-mined to psychologically profile you
and even predict your future behavior.
If we don't stop this, it's
only going to become more abusive and dangerous
This system is already being wildly abused, yet
what we're seeing today is only the beginning.
Under a government that
strips away the Second Amendment from the People while surveilling all their
private communications, no one would be safe
from Big Brother.
No
communications would be private, and anyone who criticized the White House
could be arrested and "disappeared" into Obama's network of secret prisons
that he has continued to operate.
As a society, we have gone off the cliff and are plummeting toward total
tyranny. When privacy is lost, freedom is destroyed.
If we cannot hold phone
conversations and online conversations in private without being surveiled,
tracked and data-mined by our own government, then any idea that America is
still the "land of the free" is a cruel hoax.
But Obama says "trust me!".
All this spying is perfectly fine, he claims, because the government is
running it and all the government people have been "fully briefed" on it.
Never mind the fact that the People have never been told this is happening!
You're supposed to just trust that Obama won't abuse this and that as long
as you have nothing to hide, the government won't come knocking on your door
one day.
Obama is America's sociopath
in the White House
I'm not the only one who finds this explanation
not merely absurd, but
wreaking of mental illness.
Obama has become
America's sociopath. While he vacuums up all your private conversations,
phone calls, medical information and personal photographs, he says you're
supposed to trust him because he knows "who the good guys are."
Really? Because it seems increasingly obvious to everyone else that Obama
and the entire federal government are the bad guys engaged in outrageous
violations of the Bill of Rights on a routine basis. And everything the goes
does is rooted in hypocrisy.
For example, this is a government that says
we can't video tape police on public streets because that's somehow
breaking "wiretapping" laws.
And yet, without any warrants whatsoever, this
same government can read all your emails, listen to all your phone calls and
even track your geographic locations when you initiate those calls. This is
all being justified by invoking "terrorists" that the government itself
actually runs!
Nearly all the so-called "terror plots" taking place in the
USA today are, in fact,
run by the FBI!
What's wrong with this picture?
