Reports state that the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) is expected to unveil
rules that prevents internet service providers (ISPs) from
discriminating or blocking content from any website or brand.
Simultaneously, the FCC will also hand over
power to ISPs to give preferential treatment to self-determined websites
with an additional agreement that websites will be "commercially
reasonable".
This would funnel huge amounts of cash flow to
be used to ensure consumers are marketed to and followed across the internet
for promotional purposes.
This proposal has
given cause for,
-
Comcast
-
Verizon
-
Time Warner Cable (TWC),
...to expand
their overreaching controls to monitor content and decide what is available
for internet users to see.
In addition, the FCC has opened,
"an unfair
advantage" for Facebook and Google "over startups that cant afford to pay
for priority access into US homes."
The door has been opened for,
"broadband firms
could begin to strike deals for preferential treatment on their networks"
because of the "commercially reasonable" clause.
In January, the US Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) does not have legal authority to mandate that broadband
service providers (BSPs) treat content equally on the internet.
This translates to BSPs being able to manipulate
online traffic as well as charge a premium to corporations such as Netflix
for faster connections.

Verizon, AT&T and Comcast corporations
are cited as being among the top 20 lobby groups on Capitol Hill
in 2013.
-
Comcast spent nearly $14 million in 2013
to keep their hold over Congress.
-
AT&T invested $12.3 million in 89
lobbyists to vie for their agendas to lawmakers.
-
Verizon hired nearly 100 lobbyists and
spent $10.1 million to make sure their voice was heard at our
nations capital.
In response, Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC
told the Minority media and Telecommunications Council (MMTC) that his
agency would "find other ways to enforce" net neutrality.
In 1996, with the passage of the
Telecommunications Act
the FCC was given power to regulate internet service providers (ISPs) as
either telecommunications services or information services. The difference
is that ISPs transmit data; wherein information services process the data.
To confuse the matter,
cable corporations, who both transmitted and processed data, were
brought into the mix and labeled as both telecommunication and information
services while the industry contended that there could only be one
classification for each company.
According to the Telecommunications Act, an
information service must be regulated as a common carrier as outlined in
Title II and even extending telephone companies to have the option of
providing video programming as a conventional cable television operator.
