The United States conducts monetary policy the same way it conducts foreign
policy; unilaterally.
When Fed chairman Ben Bernanke signaled last week that
he was planning to restart his bond purchasing program (Quantitative Easing)
he didn't consult with allies at the IMF, the G-20 or the WTO. He simply
issued his edict, and that was that.
The fact that the Fed's policy will
flood emerging markets with cheap capital, pushing up the value of their
currencies and igniting inflation, is of no concern to Bernanke.
He operates
on the same theory as former Treasury Secretary John Connally who breezily
quipped to a group of Euro finance ministers,
The dollar is our currency,
but your problem.
Bernanke's 15 report could have been reduced to nine words: Inflation is too
low and unemployment is too high.
That said, Bernanke is not going to sit
back hemming and hawing until congress figures out that the economy needs
more support. He's going to put downward pressure on the dollar until
inflation rises to the target 2%, increasing the prospects for lower
unemployment, a narrowing of the current account deficit, and a faster
rebound.
Economist Edward Hugh sums it up like this:
Unemployment in the United States (which is currently at 9.6%, and may
reach 10% by the end of the year) is causing enormous problems for the Obama
administration. The US labor market and welfare system are simply not
designed to run with these levels of unemployment for any length of time.
In
Japan the unemployment rate is 5.1%, and in Germany it is under 8%. So
people in Washington, not unreasonably ask themselves why the US should
shoulder so much extra unemployment and run a current account deficit just
to maintain the
Bretton Woods system and the reserve currency status of the
US Dollar.
My feeling is that the US administration has decided to reduce the
unemployment rate, and close the current account deficit, and that the only
way to achieve this is to force the value of the dollar down.
That way it
will be US factories rather than German or Japanese ones that are humming to
the sound of the new orders which come in from all that flourishing emerging
market demand.
Bernanke has drawn the same conclusions as Hugh, but that doesn't mean his
strategy won't inflict considerable damage on US allies. It will.
His
beggar-thy-neighbor QE program will force trading partners to implement
capital controls and other protectionist measures to maintain price
stability. QE will also lead to more competitive devaluation as the world's
largest economies fight for a bigger share of the export market.
The
impending clash could bring about the dissolution of the present trade
regime and a sharp reversal of 30-years of globalization.
Bernanke's biggest problem is China. China was America's darling when it was
loading up on Treasuries and fueling a historic consumption binge that
filled Wall Street's coffers. But now that the purchase of US debt is
preventing the Fed from implementing its monetary policy, Bernanke wants a
change.
Unfortunately, China is not cooperating. It's piling up foreign
exchange reserves at record pace to maintain the dollar peg which is
widening the current account deficit to pre-crisis levels.
The yawning trade
imbalance is pushing the world towards another crisis, which is why Bernanke
and Co. are determined to persuade China to let its currency to appreciate
to narrow the gap. (China's foreign exchange reserves surged to $2.65tr in
the 3rd quarter)
Bottom line:
The Fed cannot jump-start the domestic economy if the trade
deficit continues to grow. It's impossible. The stimulus just gets flushed
down the plughole.
China is soaking up the lion's share of global demand by
underbidding the US on everything under the sun. That's the real effect of
the dollar peg, it gives China an unfair advantage over its competitors.
A
free-floating currency helps to level the playing field (even if US labor is
competing with some of the world's worst paid workers) Bernanke's
announcement last Friday, is just the first shot fired over Beijing's bow.
There will be more to come. This weekend's meeting of the G-20 provides
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner with the perfect opportunity to put the
spotlight on China and to rail against currency manipulation.
Many expect
him to make a strong statement demanding changes to the policy.
An update by Reuters on Wednesday confirms the US position.
Here's a blurp:
The United States wants Group of 20 finance chiefs to commit to allowing
market forces to set currency values and will discuss using targets for
trade to measure progress, a senior U.S. Treasury Department official said
on Wednesday.
Ahead of weekend G20 meetings in Gyeongju, South Korea, the U.S. official
made clear Washington wants currency levels to be a focal point of the
meetings and sees current account surpluses and deficits a vital part of the
discussion....
From our perspective we believe these issues are fundamentally, inherently
linked and that it is important for the G20 to be able to undertake
cooperative action facilitating orderly adjustment of imbalances and also
ensuring more effective adjustment of exchange rates in line with economic
fundamentals," the official said.
(U.S. wants G20 commitment to allow
currency rises, Reuters)
Neither the
Obama administration nor the Fed want a full-blown trade war
with China.
They'd rather see China assume its position in the global
system (as US diplomats aver.) But that means that China will have to
compromise on, what it considers to be, a matter of national sovereignty.
And, there's the rub. China is a proud nation and doesn't want to be told
what to do.
But that's not how the system works. Behind the facade of free
markets and international institutions, lies an imperial system ruled from
Washington. That leaves Beijing with two options; they can either bow to US
pressure and fall in line or shrug off Washington's demands and continue on
the same path.
If they choose to resist, relations with the US will grow
more acrimonious and the probability of conflict will rise.
