# Cuba Reaches Out to Partners Far and Wide to Hedge Against U.S. 
Engagement

Recent visits to Cuba by a bevy of
European and Asian leaders highlight a key element of Raul
Castro's foreign policy that he has pursued alongside
normalization with the United States:
Don't put all of Cuba's eggs in
one international basket.
Cuba learned this lesson the hard
way...
Pre-revolutionary dependence on the
United States, followed by post-revolutionary dependence on the
Soviet Union, twice plunged Cuba into economic crisis when those
ties were severed.
Although less drastic, the current
austerity triggered by the decline in oil shipments from
Venezuela underscores the danger of relying on a single foreign
partner.
Cuba's leaders hope that better relations with Washington will
lead to beneficial commercial ties. But they are still working
hard - and successfully - to diversify the island's
international economic relations so Cuba will never again be at
the mercy of a single partner, especially not the U.S.
The risk is real. The leading edge of a tsunami of American
visitors is already crashing on Cuban shores. The number last
year
jumped 77 percent from 2014; this year it is on track to be
30 percent more than in 2015.
Hundreds of business proposals from
U.S. firms are flooding the Cuban bureaucracy.
As a counterweight to the anticipated surge in U.S. trade and
investment, Cuba has been cultivating partners farther afield,
upgrading relations with old allies Russia and China, and
normalizing relations with traditional U.S. allies in Western
Europe and Asia.
Both Russia and China are seeking to extend their influence in
Latin America:
Russia's resurgence in the Caribbean
traces back to Putin's 2000 trip to Cuba, which resulted in
expanded trade deals, followed by
Castro's 2009 visit to Moscow, his first since the end of
the Cold War.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev
traveled to Cuba in February 2013, signing a number of
agreements on trade and scientific cooperation.
In July 2014, Putin visited the
island and
agreed to forgive 90 percent of Cuba's $32 billion in
Soviet-era debt, with the remainder to be retired through
debt-equity swaps linked to Russian investments.
By the time Castro
went
to Moscow again in 2015, Russia had signed agreements to
invest in airport construction, development in the port of
Mariel, metallurgy and oil exploration. It also agreed to lend
Cuba more than $1.3 billion to develop thermal energy plants.
The linkages extend beyond commerce. Both sides refer to their
revived relationship as a "strategic
partnership" that has diplomatic and military components.
Diplomatically, Cuba supports the
Russian positions on Ukraine, Syria and NATO expansion.
Militarily, Russia is refurbishing and replacing Cuba's aging
Soviet-era arms.
Russian naval vessels visit Cuban
ports, the most prominent being the ostentatious arrival of a
large Russian surveillance vessel the day before Secretary of
State John Kerry celebrated the reopening of the
U.S. embassy in Havana in August 2015.
It was a signal that
Cuba's new friends should not expect to usurp the place of old
ones.
Cuban leaders are working
hard
to diversify the island's
international economic relations
so Cuba will never again be
at the mercy of a single
partner,
especially not the U.S.
China revived its economic
ties with Cuba in the 1990s, when Beijing provided Cuba's
reeling economy with several hundred million dollars' worth of
loans to buy consumer goods.
In 2004, then-Chinese
President Hu Jintao
visited Havana and signed 16 agreements establishing joint
ventures to manufacture many of those goods in Cuba.
In 2008, Hu offered additional
loans and agreed to invest $6 billion in Cuba's oil and gas
industry. China has also become a major partner in the
development of Cuba's transportation infrastructure, supplying
cars, buses and trains, and building rails and roads.
In 2011, while still vice
president, Xi Jinping visited Havana,
signing 13 new economic accords for cooperation in
biotechnology, telecommunications, agriculture, oil and gas.
In
2012, on trips to China and Vietnam, Castro underscored the
importance of learning from their experience transforming
stagnant, centrally planned economies into socialist market
economies - a transformation he has begun in Cuba.
The pace of cooperation between Havana and Beijing accelerated
after Castro and President Barack Obama announced the
normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations in December 2014.
Xi returned to Cuba as
president in 2015, signing 29 new agreements, followed by
Premier Li Keqiang
just last month, who agreed to cancel Cuba's $4 billion
outstanding debt. Last year, China was Cuba's second-largest
trading partner behind Venezuela, with total trade worth $1.6
billion.
Obama's decision to normalize relations implicitly gave
traditional U.S. allies permission to deepen their own ties with
Cuba without fear of angering Washington.
While U.S. businesses struggle
to disentangle themselves from the embargo, foreign companies
are moving quickly to expand commercial ties before their U.S.
competitors can get a foot on the ground.
Last month, Shinzo Abe became the first Japanese prime
minister to visit Cuba with the avowed purpose of promoting
Japanese business.
Abe's discussions with Castro
focused on
expanding trade and investment in,
-
medicine
-
infrastructure
-
energy
-
communications,
...and came just days after Japan agreed
to
write off two-thirds of Cuba's $1.75 billion debt.
Cleaning up the financial wreckage left by Cuba's 1986 default
on its long-term debt has been a priority for Castro and a
necessary condition for reintegrating Cuba into the global
economy.
Last December marked a
milestone when Cuba
signed an agreement with 15 creditor nations in the Paris
Club to write off $8.5 billion of its $11.1 billion outstanding
debt and restructure the remainder to be paid off over the next
18 years.
The exceptionally favorable
terms signaled that the Paris Club countries see more to be
gained from cultivating future business with Cuba than from
trying to recoup past losses.
The European Union has also been moving toward a political and
economic cooperation agreement with Havana to replace the 1996
Common Position that conditioned relations on Cuban human rights
practices.
Negotiations began in early
2014, before the change in U.S. policy, and have accelerated
since. They reached an agreement in
early March 2016, just days before Obama landed in Havana.
When approved by the European
Council, that agreement will expand the scope of political
dialogue and economic cooperation between Cuba and the EU's
member states.
Even as Cuban officials welcome dozens of U.S. trade missions,
they are building a robust and diverse network of international
ties to hedge:
-
if normalization succeeds,
Cuba will not be drawn back into a dependent
relationship with the Colossus of the North
-
if normalization
fails, Cuba will have no shortage of alternative
partners
