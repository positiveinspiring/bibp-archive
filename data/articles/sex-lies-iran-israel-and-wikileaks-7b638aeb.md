WikiLeaks has given the mainstream media yet another opportunity to vilify
Iran.
A typical headline, from the New York Times was: "Around the world distress over Iran."
And, ironically, it is true, but not in the way
the headline writer meant.
Around the world there is distress over Iran,
distress at the way it is being cast in the role of the Evil Doer, when all
but the most ignorant observers realize that it is
nuclear-armed Apartheid
Israel that is the real threat to world peace, not Iran.
