On October 15, 2009, Bill Gates, the co-chair of the Gates Foundation
announced his $120 million grant to the Alliance for a Green Revolution
in Africa (AGRA).
AGRA, an organization that was set up by the
Gates Foundation in 2006, was developed under the pretext of ensuring that
small farmers get the funding needed that will enable them to feed
themselves and their communities. On the surface this looks like a great
initiative because, finally, Africa is getting the help it needed for so
long.
However, as with anything that involves
purveyors of capitalism and imperialism, there is an underlying agenda.
Understanding the
Gates Agenda
Gates is at the forefront of promoting
Genetically Modified (GMO) seeds which,
arguably, does more harm than good.
Gates has reportedly doled out 1.4 billion
dollars in grants to help get poor developing nations on track in the
avenues of agriculture and sustainability. Gates, along with the,
...and the government of Norway, is one of the
financial backers of the
Svalbard Global Seed Vault, located in the
icy mountains of Norway.
The project to build this massive underground
vault was completed in February 2008.
Agriculturalist from around the world have
participated in this project by sending every possible specimen of non-GMO
seeds to this bank to ensure its survival and reconstitution pending an
environmental melt down which could leave human beings scrambling to get
what is behind this vaults walls.
One could argue that if the GMO seeds that
Syngenta produces, were so good why not just manufacture them and put them
in the vault.
Gates is not a Philanthropist or a Humanitarian; he is a
Capitalist whose main objective is to become richer at the expense of
the masses of people. His apparent generosity comes with a catch that
will throw poor farmers into debt. Small farmers have to purchase this seed
and all of the chemical insecticides and fertilizers that go along with it
in order to yield a good harvest.
These chemical insecticides are manufactured
through one of the largest purveyors of chemical farming and genetic
engineering,
Monsanto.
We saw the devastating effect on Indias Rice farmers when in
October-December of 2008 thousands of farmer committed suicide facing the
loss of their land because of the debt incurred by farming with these
government promoted GMO rice seeds.
In one instance it has been found that GMO or hybrid seeds degrade the soil
inhibiting growth of any other types of seed for at least 10 years.
Why Africa is so important
As the Western world is becoming more and more dependent on Africa's
abundant resources, because of its own scarcity, many Western and Eastern
nations have turned to Africa not only to loot its mineral wealth but now to
grow food for export to their own countries.
The Grab for Africa is now coming in the
form of a manufactured Green Revolution cloaked behind environmentalism
but seeks to secure the survival of Imperialism while deepening the
exploitation of African people.
Gates is another weapon of colonialism and
domination in the ongoing war against African people.
He, being one of the worlds richest men, can
use his financial clout to inject these GMO seeds into our communities.
Although no independent scientific research has been conducted on GMO seeds,
the nutritional benefits are arguably extremely deficient than seeds that
come from the earth.
Let the technological whiz kids of the bio-tech
labs tell it and theyll say that these seeds will be the saving grace of
Africa.
African people need to have control of their lands and access to technology
that will help them grow food in a sustainable way.
Africans must say no!
Present studies reveal that 55% of the land on the continent is unsuitable
for agricultural farming. This could be a result of the centurys long de-nutrionalizing
of the soil by producing large amounts of the same crop for export to
western nations, and by-products of industrialization like soil
contamination from industrial waste.
This situation can only be exacerbated by the
introduction of these nutrient robbing seeds that work to:
-
Line the pockets of big capitalist
organizations by keeping poor people in debt
-
Contaminate African people and the
worlds population with genetic seed experiments
-
Continue a history of control, but this
time targeting our lifes source, the very food we eat
In every way that we can, Africans must say no
to the bio-tech fields advances to deposit their lab experiments within our
communities.
The survival of African People and the world
depends on Africans alignment with nature and our historic ability to farm.
Africans were targeted during the slave trade and colonialism, in many
cases, for our ability to produce abundant crops.
Ancient irrigation and farming techniques were
used to provide sustenance for our colonizers (read
Black Rice by Judith Carney).
As Africans,
-
We must rely on ourselves to engineer
the best plan to feed the people
-
We must use what we have been taught and
teach other Africans
-
We must reconstitute the soil in places
like Haiti and Zimbabwe
-
We must say no to our governments
leasing arable land to foreign governments to produce food for
export
-
We must think of our own interests first
Say no to
GMO and
AGRA and say yes to All African Peoples
Development and Empowerment Project (AAPDEP)
to help African people the world over take control of their food source and
ensure the best for coming generations.
AAPDEP is on the ground in places Like Sierra
Leone, Florida and California promoting self determination in our hands.
Instituting programs like community health workers training, rainwater
harvestings systems, community gardening and farming, and Birth Centers.
AAPDEPs primary objective is to ensure that
we can not only maintain ourselves but to sustain ourselves through
initiatives that will secure our own survival and empowerment.
