PSI-TECH Corporation
Involved in military/Intelligence applications of research into psychotronics,
parapsychology, remote viewing, and contacting extra-terrestrial consciousness.
"Edward Dames [Major, Ret] was assigned for over two years to the U.S. Army
Intelligence Unit that utilized Controlled Remove Viewing as a data collection
too. Prior to his military retirement he founded Psi-Tech Corporation, a company
now based in Beverly Hills, California, of which he is the president. Psi-Tech
offers 'TRV' services for companies interested in find out out what the future
holds, what their competition is doing, and what the 'best path' scenario
will be. Mr. Dames offers TRV training to the public. He is extremely interested
in using remote viewing for UFO and 'Future' research work and can often
be seen in the media spotlight."
Please advise me if you want this invasion of privacy in your home. At
the very least, American's tax dollars should not fund this company but you
may want more than that. There's no doubt in my mind that extra-terrestrials
would be grateful to end the invasion of their privacy also.
Let me know at ajohnsonpresnsi@truedemocracy.net. Mark it PSI-Tech in the
subject heading.
