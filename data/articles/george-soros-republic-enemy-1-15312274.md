"The main obstacle to a stable and just
world order is the United States."
- George Soros
"George Soros is an evil man. Hes anti-God, anti-family,
anti-American, and
anti-good."
- Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson
Is it possible to lay the global financial meltdown, the
radicalizing of the Democratic Party, and Americas moral decline,
at the feet of one man?
It is indeed possible.
If George Soros isnt the worlds preeminent
"malignant messianic
narcissist," hell do until the real thing comes along. Move over,
Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot. Theres a new kid on the block.
What we have in Soros, is a multi-billionaire atheist, with skewed
moral values, and a sociopaths lack of conscience. He considers
himself to be a world class philosopher, despises capitalism, and
just loves social engineering.
Uh oh. Can you say "trouble," boys and girls?
Soros is a real life version of Dr. Evil - with
Obama in the role of
Mini-Me. Which is not as humorous as it might at first sound. In
fact, its bone-deep chilling.
Gy√∂rgy Schwartz, better known to the world as
George Soros, was born
August 12, 1930 in Hungary. Soros father, Tivadar, was a fervent
practitioner of Esperanto - a language invented in 1887, and designed
to be the first global language, free of any national identity.
The Schwartzs, who were non-practicing Jews, changed the family
name to Soros, in order to facilitate assimilation into the gentile
population, as the Nazis spread into Hungary during the 1930s.
Soros
is an Esperanto word meaning "to soar."
In 1944 Hitlers henchman
Adolf Eichmann arrived in Hungary, to
oversee the murder of that countrys Jews. The Soros children were
all given fake identity papers, and were shipped out to various
Christian families. George Soros ended up with a man whose job was
confiscating property from the Jewish population. Soros went with
him on his rounds.
Soros has repeatedly called 1944 "the best
year of his life."
In an article in the
Wall Street Journal, Joshua Muravchik notes
that,
"70% of Mr. Soross fellow Jews in Hungary,
nearly a half-million human beings, were annihilated in that year. They
were dying and disappearing all around him, and their numbers no doubt
included many whom he knew personally. Yet he gives no sign that this
put any damper on his elation, either at the time or indeed in
retrospect."
During an interview with "Sixty Minutes" Steve Kroft, Soros was
asked about his "best year":
Sweetness & Light
KROFT: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of
yours who
swore that you were his adopted godson.
SOROS: Yes. Yes.
KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property
from the Jews.
SOROS: Yes. Thats right. Yes.
KROFT: I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots
of people to the
psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult?
SOROS: Not, not at all. Not at all.
KROFT: No feeling of guilt?
SOROS: No.
Of course he didnt feel guilty. Soros has
the moral depth of a
clam.
Nonetheless, he has said,
"my goal is to become the conscience of the
world."
In his article, Muravchik describes how Soros has admitted to having,
"carried some rather potent messianic
fantasies with me from childhood, which I felt I had to control,
otherwise they might get me in trouble."
Can you imagine the results of this messianic sociopath being
"the conscience of the world?" Ye gods.
Be that as it may. After WWII, Soros attended the
London School of
Economics, where he fell under the thrall of fellow atheist and
Hungarian,
Karl Popper, one of his professors. Popper was a mentor
to Soros until Poppers death in 1994. Two of Poppers most
influential teachings concerned "the open society," and Fallibilism.
Fallibilism is the philosophical doctrine that all claims of
knowledge could, in principle, be mistaken. Then again, I could be
wrong about that.
The "open society" basically refers to a "test and evaluate"
approach to social engineering.
Regarding "open society"
Roy Childs
writes,
"Since the Second World War, most of the Western democracies
have followed Poppers advice about piecemeal social engineering and
democratic social reform, and it has gotten them into a grand mess."
In 1956 Soros moved to New York City, where he worked on Wall
Street, and started amassing his fortune. He specialized in hedge
funds and currency speculation.
Soros is absolutely ruthless, amoral, and clever in his business
dealings, and quickly made his fortune. By the 1980s he was well on
his way to becoming the global powerhouse that he is today.
In an article Kyle-Anne Shiver wrote for
"The American Thinker" she
says,
"Soros made his first billion in 1992 by
shorting the British pound with leveraged billions in financial
bets, and became known as the man who broke the Bank of England. He
broke it on the backs of hard-working British citizens who
immediately saw their homes severely devalued and their life savings
cut drastically
almost overnight."
In 1994 Soros crowed in "The New Republic" that
"the former Soviet Empire is now called the Soros Empire."
The Russia-gate scandal in
1999, which almost collapsed the Russian economy, was labeled by
Rep. Jim Leach, then head of the House Banking Committee, to be
"one of the greatest social robberies in human history."
The "Soros
Empire" indeed.
In 1997 Soros almost destroyed the economies of Thailand and
Malaysia. At the time, Malaysias Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad,
called Soros "a villain, and a moron."
Thai activist Weng Tojirakarn
said,
"We regard George Soros as a kind of Dracula. He sucks the
blood from the people." (Source)
The
website Greek National Pride reports,
"[Soros] was part of the
full court press that dismantled Yugoslavia and caused trouble in
Georgia, Ukraine and Myanmar [Burma]. Calling himself a
philanthropist, Soros role is to tighten the ideological
stranglehold of globalization and the New World Order while promoting
his own financial gain. He is without conscience; a capitalist who
functions with absolute amorality."
France has upheld an earlier conviction against Soros, for felony
insider trading. Soros was fined 2.9 million dollars. (Source)
Recently, his native Hungary fined Soros 2.2 million dollars for
"illegal market manipulation."
Elizabeth Crum writes that,
"The
Hungarian economy has been in a state of transition as the country
seeks to become more financially stable and westernized. [Soros]
deliberately driving down the share price of its largest bank put
Hungarys economy into a wicked tailspin, one from which it is still
trying to recover." (Source)
Soros grasp, greed, gluttony have a global reach
My point here is that Soros is a planetary parasite. His grasp,
greed, and gluttony have a global reach. But what about America?
Soros told Australias national newspaper "The Australian",
"America,
as the centre of the globalized financial markets, was sucking up
the savings of the world. This is now over. The game is out," he
said, adding that the time has come for "a very serious adjustment"
in Americans consumption habits.
Ready to tighten your belts, America?
Soros also told "The
Australian"
that the
world financial crisis was, "stimulating"
and "in a way, the culmination of my lifes work"
Stimulating.
Have you found the job losses, house foreclosures, and
incredible national debt - stimulating? Me neither.
Obama has recently promised 10 billion of our tax dollars to Brazil
(yes, billion with a "b"), in order to give them a leg-up in
expanding their offshore oil fields. Obamas largesse towards
Brazil, came shortly after Soros invested heavily in Brazilian oil (Petrobras).
Tait Trussel writes,
"The Petrobras loan may be a windfall for
Soros and Brazil, but it is a bad deal for the U.S. The American
Petroleum Institute estimates that oil exploration in the U.S. could
create 160,000 new, well-paying jobs, as well as $1.7 trillion in
revenues to federal, state, and local governments, all while fostering
greater energy security."
Do you get the feeling that American taxpayers are being treated
like gullible suckers?
(By the way, if you want a short primer on Far Left economics
- and a
great cartoon from a 1911 St. Louis Post-Dispatch - go to actor
Michael Moriartys website).
A blog you might want to keep an eye on is
SorosWatch.com.
This is
their mission:
"This blog is dedicated to all
who have
suffered due to the ruthless financial pursuits of
George Soros. Your
stories are many and varied, but the theme is the same: the destructive
power of greed without conscience. We pledge to tirelessly watch Soros
wherever he goes and to print the truth in the hope that he will one day
stop preying upon the worlds poor
that justice will be served."
Back to America. Soros has been actively working to destroy America
from the inside out for some years now. People have been warning us.
Two years ago Bill OReilly said on,
"The OReilly Factor" that "Soros [is] an extremist who wants open borders, a one-world foreign
policy, legalized drugs, euthanasia, and on and on. This is
off-the-chart dangerous
." (Source)
In 1997
Rachel Ehrenfeld wrote,
"Soros uses his philanthropy to
change - or more accurately deconstruct - the moral values and attitudes
of the Western world, and particularly of the American people. His
"open society" is not about freedom; it is about license. His vision
rejects the notion of ordered liberty, in favor of an ideology of rights
and entitlements."
Perhaps the most important of these "whistle blowers" are
David
Horowitz and Richard Poe. Their book "The Shadow Party" outlines in
detail how Soros hijacked the Democratic Party, and now owns it
lock, stock, and barrel.
Soros has been packing the Democratic Party with radicals, and
ousting moderate Democrats for years. I dont have time to do the
subject justice in this article, but FrontPages Jamie Glazov has an
excellent interview with
Richard Poe, which will fill you in on many
of the facts.
The Shadow Party became the Shadow Government, which became the
Obama Administration.
DiscoverTheNetworks.org (another good source) writes,
"By his [Soros]
own admission, he helped engineer coups in Slovakia, Croatia,
Georgia, and Yugoslavia. When Soros targets a country for "regime
change," he begins by creating a shadow government - a fully formed
government-in-exile, ready to assume power when the opportunity arises.
The Shadow Party he has built in America greatly resembles those he has
created in other countries prior to instigating a coup."
The above quote was, of course, written before the Presidential
Election. So was the following quote from a November 2008 edition of
the German magazine "Der Spiegel," in which Soros gives his opinion
on what the next POTUS should do after taking office.
"I think we
need a large stimulus package
." Soros thought that around 600
billion would be about right.
Soros also said that,
"I think this is a great opportunity to
finally deal with global warming and energy dependence. The U.S. needs a
cap and trade system with auctioning of licenses for emissions rights."
Any of this sound familiar?
Although Soros doesnt (yet) own the Republican Party, like he does
the Democrats, make no mistake, his tentacles are spread throughout
the Republican Party as well.
Soros is a partner in the
Carlyle Group where he has invested more than 100 million dollars. According
to an article by "The Baltimore
Chronicles" Alice Cherbonnier, the
Carlye Group is run by,
"a
veritable whos who of former Republican leaders," from CIA man
Frank Carlucci, to CIA head [and ex-President]
George Bush,
Sr.
In late 2006, Soros bought about 2 million shares of
Halliburton - Dick Cheneys old stomping grounds.
When the Democrats and Republicans held their conventions in 2000,
Soros held Shadow Party conventions in the same cities, at the same
time. Republican Senator John McCain was the keynote speaker at the
"Soros Convention" (so labelled by the late Robert Novak) in
Philadelphia.
Soros has dirtied both sides of the aisle, trust me. And if that
werent bad enough, he has long held connections with the CIA.
And I mustn't forget to mention Soros involvement with the LSM (Lame
Stream Media), the entertainment industry (e.g. he owns 2.6 million
shares of Time Warner), and the various political advertising
organizations he funnels millions to.
As
Matthew Vadum writes,
"The liberal
billionaire-turned-philanthropist has been buying up media properties
for years in order to drive home his message to the American public that
they are too materialistic, too wasteful, too selfish, and too stupid to
decide for themselves how to run their own lives."
Richard Poe writes,
"Soros private philanthropy, totaling
nearly $5 billion, continues undermining Americas traditional Western
values. His giving has provided funding of abortion rights, atheism,
drug legalization, sex education, euthanasia, feminism, gun control,
globalization, mass immigration, gay marriage and other radical
experiments in social engineering."
Some of the many NGOs (None Government Organizations) that Soros
funds with his billions are:
-
MoveOn.org
-
the Apollo Alliance
-
Media
Matters for America
-
the Tides Foundation
-
the ACLU, ACORN, PDIA
(Project on Death In America
-
La Raza,
...and many more.
For a more
complete list, with brief descriptions of the NGOs, go to
DiscoverTheNetworks.org.
Poe continues,
"Through his global web of Open Society
Institutes and Open Society Foundations, Soros has spent 25 years
recruiting, training, indoctrinating and installing a network of loyal
operatives in 50 countries, placing them in positions of influence and
power in media, government, finance and academia."
As Ive said before, America currently faces the greatest challenge
to its existence as a free republic since the Civil War.
And as we
go, so goes the world.
-
So is Soros to blame for all of Americas woes?
-
Without Soros, would the Saul Alinsky Chicago machine still be
rolling?
-
Would SEIU, ACORN, and La Raza still be pursuing their
nefarious activities?
-
Would Big Money and lobbyists still be
corrupting government?
-
Would our college campuses still be
retirement homes for 1960s radicals?
Yes, yes, yes, and yes - but to
much less of a degree.
The purpose of this article is to point out that without the
financial skullduggery and Machiavellian manipulations of Soros,
America would be a considerably safer, saner, and stabler place to
live.
America stands at the brink of an abyss, and that fact is directly
attributable to Soros. Soros has vigorously, cleverly, and
insidiously planned the ruination of America.
His conduct has been immoral, duplicitous, and traitorous. Stripping
Soros of his U.S. citizenship, should be one of the first steps
taken during the upcoming courtroom trials.
And trials there must be. No matter the cost, the nest of vipers on
Capitol Hill, and all of the traitors in the government at large,
must be brought to task for their behavior, or a free America is
doomed.
The words of Patrick Henry are apropos:
"Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to
be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty
God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me
liberty, or give me death!"
These days, Patrick Henrys sentiment is more than just some quaint
hyperbole from long ago - its a slow burning, but intense, glow that
fires our courage and heart.
Laus Deo.
