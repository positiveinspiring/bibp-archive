Citing violations of European data protection
laws,
the group has taken legal action against
Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Skype, and Yahoo.
A student group has charged several U.S.
technology companies with violations of European law for allegedly
cooperating with the NSA to collect data on private citizens.
Known as
Europe-v-Facebook (EVF), the group of
Austrian students announced Wednesday that it
filed formal complaints with the EU against,
The group contends that since the five companies
do business in Europe through subsidiaries, they fall under European privacy
laws. Such laws allow the export of data only if the
company's European subsidiary can guarantee an "adequate level or
protection" in the home country.
Following the revelations of the National
Security Agency's
PRISM program, the group believes that the "adequate level of
protection" requirement was violated.
"There can in no way be an adequate level of
protection if they cooperate with the NSA on the other end of the line,"
EVF speaker Max Schrems said in a statement.
"Right now an export of data to the U.S.
must be seen as illegal if the involved companies cannot disprove the
reports on the PRISM program."
Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, Apple, Skype, and
other U.S. technology firms have acknowledged
receiving requests by the government for user data. But the companies
have
refuted reports that the government has direct access to their servers.
The complaints by the EVF are actually directed
at the European subsidiaries of the five companies.
To back up its charges, the group cited a 2006
case known as "Swift," in which EU data protection officials ruled that a
mass transfer of data to the U.S. is illegal under European law.
The finding
specifically emphasized that,
"even
in the fight against terrorism and crime fundamental rights must remain
guaranteed."
The EVF also is looking to lodge complaints
against Google and YouTube. Neither company works directly through a
European intermediate, making the legal situation a bit trickier.
But the group believes it can still take action
against Google since the search giant hosts data centers in Ireland,
Belgium, and Finland.
