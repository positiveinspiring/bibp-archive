Among the
long list of items bundled
by
consensus reality merchants
under the
banner of conspiracy theory,
is a world
without cash - where
technocrats
rule over the populace,
and
everything and anything,
is
exchanged via plastic and RFID
chips.
In this sterile and controlled Orwellian
hi-tech society, the idea of cash being passed from hand to hand would
be as archaic as the thought of carrying around a rucksack of tally
sticks today.
Still, despite the incredible penetration of
credit and debit card transactions into economic aggregate, and the boom
in internet shopping, few will comfortably admit that a cashless society
is nearly upon us.
In part, its a natural denial by many
fueled by the idea of our society is indeed on a collision course with
the sort of dystopic impersonal future like that depicted in the 1970â€²s
sci-fi film classic, 'Logans
Run'.
Cashless money is here,
and growing rapidly.
Over the years, futurists and commentators
alike seemed to agree that a cashless society would be a slow creep, and
cash would automatically phase itself in simply by virtue of the sheer
volume of electronic transactions that would gradually make paper less
available and more costly to redeem and exchange.
This is still true for the most part.
What few counted on, however, was how the
final push would take place, and why. Some will be surprised by these
new emerging mechanisms, and the political and sinister implications
they will ultimately lead to.
Whats the time frame on all this?
Difficult to say, but what is certain is that the initial phases are
already in motion
Introduction of
Parallel Currencies
There has been a lot made about the
cashless society in media, but this cannot fully happen until there is
a cashless currency.
Every revolution needs a good crisis in
order to germinate its seed.
The cashless revolution is no different. It
should be abundantly clear by now that the global financial meltdown has
been engineered at every juncture of its unfolding by the very private
central banks who expand and contract the money supply. A dollar or euro
collapse will trigger a global economic crisis, which is a prime
opportunity to introduce the next phase.
In the summer of 2012, at the height of the
European Central Bank (ECB) ritualistic raping of the Greek
economy, financial expert Max Keiser, alongside Mexican
billionaire Hugo Salinas Price, traveled to Athens to
promote the idea of a silver Drachma as a parallel currency to
the ever-failing euro.
In theory and in practice, this parallel
currency was sound money for individual Greeks and would allow them to
retain some say in their financial destiny, and also allow them to
accumulate real wealth. It should have caught on.
But this great idea did not go down well
with media moguls and technocratic elites loyal to their overlords in
the ECB, Wall Street and the City of London.
Still, too many people remain unaware
of how money is created, entered into circulation and how their
private central banks control inflation, and Greece is no different.
Watch this clip from
Greek television:
The U.S. dollar is pure fiat, but it does have
a theoretical backer.
It is an oil-backed currency - and for
better of for worse, its on its way to losing its long-lived status as
the worlds reserve currency. There are signals that China is moving
towards a gold-backed currency and has already agreed to buy the
majority of its oil supply from Russia off of the U.S. dollar peg.
This could mean two things:
-
the U.S. could be forced to fight a
war to maintain dollar supremacy, or
-
the dollar will begin to drop as
the top dog
This shift will open up a window of
opportunity for money masters to insert not only a brand new global
currency, but also its universal cashless attributes as well.
Common sense and free market wisdom would
expect to see a sound money option replace the current fiat disaster,
but as we saw in Greece, a great solution was not taken up and straddled
with the dysfunctional euro, that society will continue to pay the cost
of that reality.
The euro crisis was a great opportunity to
throw out the euro in favor of something that could create wealth,
rather than debt.
As the fiat currencies continue to slide
downhill, globalist are preparing their solution behind closed doors.
Enter the Cashless Currency
Its arguable that we approaching the cusp
of that U.S. Dollar collapse, and perhaps a Euro implosion on the back end
of it.
Risks of hyper inflation are very real here,
but if you control the money supply might already have a ready-made
solution waiting in the wings, you will not be worrying about the rift,
only waiting for the chaos to ensue so as to maximize your own booty
from the crisis.
Many believed that the global currency would
be the
'SDR unit,' aka Special Drawing Rights, implemented in
2001 as a supplementary foreign exchange reserve asset maintained by
the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
SDRs were not considered a full-fledged
currency, but rather a claim to currency held by IMF member countries
for which they may be exchanged for dollars, euros, yen or other central
bankers
fiat notes.
With the SDR confined to the upper tier of
the international money launderette, a new product is still needed to
dovetail with designs of a global cashless society.
Two new
parallel currencies are
currently being used exclusively within the electronic, or cashless
domain -
Bitcoin and
Ven.
Among the many worries Ben Bernanke
listed in his
speech at the New York Economic Club last week was the emergence of
Bitcoin.
But dont believe for a second that
these digital parallel currencies are not being watched over and even
steered by the money masters. Couple this latest trend with done deals
by most of the worlds largest mobile networks this month to allow
people to pay via a mobile wallet, and you now have the initial
enabler for a new global electronic currency.
These new parallel cashless currencies could
very quickly end up in pole position for supremacy when the old fiat
notes fade away as a result of the next planned economic dollar and euro
crisis.
Both Bitcoin and Ven appear
on their surface to be independent parallel digital money systems, but
the reality is much different. In April 2011,
Ven
announced the first commodity trade priced in Ven for gold production
between Europe and South America.
Both of these so-called digital
alternatives are being backed and promoted through some of the worlds
biggest and most long-standing corporate dynasties, including
Rothschild owned Reuters as an
example, which should be of interest to any activist who believes that a
digitally controlled global currency is a dangerous path to tread down.
The Electronic Deutsche
Mark
Much is made of Germanys prominent
financial position within the EU, with a popular talking point being
that,
Germany is carrying the majority of the
load in bailing out countries such as Greece in the south.
If the Euro is heading south as many a
financial commentator are claiming, then how would a country like
Germany - or even
the U.S. Federal Reserve for that matter, hedge their
bets with an impending currency collapse looming just over the horizon?
Economics professor
Miles Kimball from the University
of Michigan thinks he knows the answer:
In
short, for a smooth transition, a reintroduced mark needs to be an
electronic mark. I recently made the case for the electronic dollar
in a previous Quartz column, 'E-Money
- How paper currency is holding the U.S. recovery back.'
The
trouble with paper money is that the rate of interest people earn on
holding paper money puts a floor on the interest rate they are
willing to accept in doing any other lending.
For the
U.S., I proposed making the electronic dollar the unit of account or
economic yardstick for prices and other economic values, and having
the Federal Reserve control the exchange rate between electronic
dollars and paper dollars to make paper dollars gradually fall in
value relative to electronic dollars during periods of time when the
Fed wants room to make the interest rate negative.
In the
case of Germany, there would be no need to reintroduce a paper mark
along with the electronic mark, since the euro itself could continue
in its current role as a medium of exchange for making purchases
in Germany, alongside the electronic mark.
A
crawling peg exchange rate could be used to let the electronic
mark gradually go up in value relative to the euro, without causing
a huge rush into the mark, since with no paper mark other than the
euro itself, interest rates in Germany could be close to zero when
measured in Euros, which would make them strongly negative in terms
of marks.
A dollar or euro crash could be the perfect
storm for the introduction of a major global digital currencies, and
this will do nothing but fast-track our entry into the new cashless
society.
Contactless Payments
This past years Summer Olympic was a beta
testing exercise for a number of new programs.
We witnessed troops deployed en mass for the
first time to marshal the international sporting event and new facial
recognition technology tested to monitor its attendees.
One of the chief sponsors of London 2012
Olympic was VISA,
used the event as a springboard to launch its new contactless
payment technology, acclimatizing the international public to
making routine payments via smartphones.
VISA now predicts that this new
method will carry 50 per cent of its transaction volume by the year
2020.
Mastercard has also rolled out its
own version called Paypass, and
Barclaycard has already
implemented its own mobile phone payment chip in 2011.
It conceivable here, that a bank like
Barclays could one day takeover a major mobile service provider in order
to streamline the endless profits it could accrue from monopolizing
cashless payment facilities for its customers.
A recent edition of Marketing
Week further explains how this is program is being rolled out:
Barclays
launched Pingit this year, a mobile payment service that allows
customers to send and receive money with a mobile phone number,
which has sparked The Payments Council to work on a similar project.
And the
three leading mobile operators in the UK - EE, Vodafone and O2 - are
working on a joint project under the name Weve, one of the aims of
which is to develop standardized technology for digital wallets on
mobile.
These
industry innovations reflect the changing attitude and behavior by
consumers to cashless payments.
Barry
Clark, account director at Future Foundation, which identified the
trend towards a cashless society in its recent report into the
changing face of payments, explains that this move towards digital
is a banking nirvana for brands, since replacing cash with
electronic payments takes high costs out of the system.
These mobile enablers will effectively cover
the small services and contractors market for the cashless society.
In addition, digital payment terminals like
iZettle and Square (created
by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey), have brought in most small traders,
including taxi drivers, plumbers etc, and street side retailers -
meaning that the barrier for entry into the new cashless society has
been effectively dissolved.
The Socialist
Oyster
The darker aspect of a cashless society, is
one which few are debating or discussing, but is actually the most
pivotal in terms of social engineering and transforming communities and
societies.
In London, the electronic touch payment
Oyster Card was introduced in 2003, initially for public
transport, and since that time the card has been co-opted to be used for
other functions, as the UK beta tests the idea of an all-in-one cashless
lifestyle solution.
Ironically, and alongside biometric chipping
now in India, its the United States, supposedly the birthplace of
modern capitalism, who is beta testing its own socialist technocracy.
As the ranks of the poor and unemployed grow
and dollar inflation rises in America, more and more people are
dependent on traditional Food Stamp
entitlements in order to feed their families. The U.S. has now introduced
its own socialist Oyster to replace the old Food Stamp program.
Its called the
EBT, which stands
for Electronic Benefit Transfer,
as a means of transferring money from the central government to people
living below the poverty line.
Advocate Mike Adams for
Natural News
describes it another way:
EBT
benefits have
more than doubled during the Obama administrations last four
years, creating tens of millions of new dependents who now
vote based almost entirely on who gives them the most handouts.
The
purchase of vitamins is specifically prohibited by the EBT
program. This is done as a way to keep EBT recipients sick and
diseased while suffering from nutritional deficiencies, which is
precisely what the federal government wants.
EBT
cards create high-profit handouts to corporations, too:
-
Pharmaceutical companies and the sick-care industry
-
Big
Government which gets re-elected based on entitlement handouts
-
global banks which earn a percentage off every swipe
-
the processed junk food industry which preys upon nutritional
ignorance of the poor
In
fact, for every dollars worth of food handed out to EBT
recipients under the program, at least 50 cents is driven right
into the profit coffers of wealthy corporations.
Adams has pointed out the endgame here.
Where
collectivist technocrats are
concerned, a global digital currency is not only a means for a
centrally controlled economy, but also a centrally controlled
society. And as Adams also pointed out, they can even control
what you eat.
Theres also the small matter of the
Verichip, or class 2â€² implantable medical devise, an RFID chip
already
set to be implemented through
Obamacare. It
will transmit medical records, bank accounts, keyless entry and much
more. The technology could be a $100 Trillion industry over the
coming decade.
Bottom line:
Weve
got a big problem when the state can - and will cut-off your
electronic financial lifeline should you fall foul of the system.
No negotiations, no gray areas - and
definitely no place for a free individual in this type of globalist
system.
Social Networks
Gradually Supplanting Real Communities
In 2011
Facebook launched its own
virtual currency, which was taken up immediately by the games
developer industry.
Facebook created its own internal
digital market overnight. If customers didnt like it, they had two
choices - jump ship, or stay in the biggest market place. Thats a
lot of power to wield, and you can wield it if you have the big
numbers.
A severe lack of choice in the world of
online communities has unwittingly (or not) positioned Facebook to
play the roles of not only data collector, but also as banker,
retailer, archivist and governor.
As 2012 comes to a close, many people
have certainly become, in one way or another, sans border citizens
of the Facebook
Nation. In the future, one corporation or cartels success
in capturing a near global monopoly of membership to a particular
online platform might give it the ability to dictate a digital
economic mandate to both producers and consumer.
The digital data industry now claims in
a recent study by fast.MAP,
that consumer confidence in sharing personal information has risen.
But the reality is that most people do
not know which data is being used and to who it is being shared or
sold to. Most users are unknowingly trading access to networks, as
well convenient speed of registration - for data privacy. We do this
on a daily basis now.
Its a question of speculation at this
point how deeply the new digital currencies will be integrated into
social networking giants like Facebook, or
Second Life -
where users are already buying virtual property with virtual
currency, but few can deny that the potential for consolidation
in the early 21st century is already there.
History Will Repeat
Itself
Whenever the status quo is seen as a
failure, the architects of society will rarely allow the whole show to
come to a grinding halt, for fear that new and non-centrally controlled
organic systems of organization will emerge.
The ruling establishment will spare no
opportunity to tell society this, over and over, making people truly
believe that it is in their best interest to adopt whatever alternative
is handed down to them.
This is why, when faced with a crisis,
society will almost always seek to implement a parallel alternatives,
rather than rethink the whole system.
In 2008, the public had an opportunity to
collapse the predatory banking system that has been trading insolvent
and gambling on thin air. But the very same ruling establishment who
engineered the crisis to begin with, masterfully presented their own
solution as the remedy by establishing the precedent of the state
bailing out any gambling losses incurred by the banking community.
In the end society relented, and with
help of pro-banking political leadership on both sides of the Atlantic,
they adopted the pre-packaged belief that a cluster of bloated and
corrupt financial institutions were simply too big to fail.
Aside from being a massive
redistribution of wealth upwards into the hands of the speculative elite
classes, this was merely a test by the establishment to see how far they
could go in,
...all in one swoop.
It has long been the dream of collectivists
and technocratic elites to eliminate the semi-unregulated cash economy
and black markets in order to maximize taxation and to fully control
markets. If the cashless society is ushered in, they will have near
complete control over the lives of individual people.
The
financial collapse which began in
2007-2008 was merely the opening gambit of
the elite criminal class, a
mere warm-up for things to come. With the next collapse we may see a
centrally controlled global digital currency gaining its final foothold.
The
cashless society is already here.
The
question now is,
How far
will society allow it to penetrate and completely control each and
every aspect of their day to day lives?
