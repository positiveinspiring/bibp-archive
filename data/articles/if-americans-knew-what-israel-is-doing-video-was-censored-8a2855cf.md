The Public Campaign to Stop the Lies and the Denial of
the Main Motive for the 9/11 Attacks - U.S. Support for Israel
Those who want to suppress the facts have
dishonestly contacted YouTube and claimed that the video "If Americans Knew
What Israel Is Doing!" was a Terms of Service Violation. The video is
clearly NOT a TOS violation. You can see why they don't want you to see it.
The user "rbdevon4" was a smart-ass contacting me
with this message:
"You have violated YouTube terms of use
policy with your anti-Semitic hate videos. You must remove them
IMMEDIATELY! Thank you for your cooperation."
Soon after that, he and his buddies succeeded in
getting my video removed.
U.S. support of Israel puts America at risk and
it is immoral and unjust. If Americans knew what Israel was actually doing
they would not support it in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is the
goal of If Americans Knew to provide full and accurate information on this
critical issue, and on our power - and duty - to bring a resolution.
Mainstream Media, the 9/11 Commission Report,
politicians and pundits have all downplayed and/or omitted the fact that the
main motive for the 9/11 attacks was outrage over U.S. support of Israel.
Here is a rare exception to the suppression, it
comes from The Forward:
Outrage Over US Support of Israel
The fact is from November 1947 to May 1948 the
Zionists were already on the offensive and had already attacked Arabs. In
the months before Israel was declared, the Zionists had driven 300,000
non-Jews off their land. In the months before Israel was declared, the
Zionists had seized land beyond the proposed Jewish State.

The Israeli government's Foreign Ministry is involved in efforts to
influence public opinion on the Internet. Israel's Foreign Ministry orders
Internet propagandists, so called "trainee diplomats," to skew online polls
and public forums to conform with the Israeli line.
