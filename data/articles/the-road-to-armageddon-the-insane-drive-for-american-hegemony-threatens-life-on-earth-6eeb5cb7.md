The Washington Times is a newspaper that looks with favor upon the
Bush/Cheney/Obama/neocon wars of aggression in the Middle East and favors
making terrorists pay for 9/11.
Therefore, I was surprised to learn on
February 24 that the most popular story on the papers website for the past
three days was the Inside the Beltway report, Explosive News, about the
31 press conferences in cities in the US and abroad on February 19 held by
Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, an organization of professionals
which now has 1,000 members.
I was even more surprised that the news report treated the press conference
seriously.
-
How did three World Trade Center skyscrapers suddenly disintegrate into fine
dust?
-
How did massive steel beams in three skyscrapers suddenly fail as a
result of short-lived, isolated, and low temperature fires?
A thousand
architects and engineers want to know, and are calling on Congress to order
a new investigation into the destruction of the Twin Towers and Building 7,
reports the Washington Times.
The paper reports that the architects and engineers have concluded that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the
National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) provided,
insufficient, contradictory and fraudulent accounts
of the circumstances of the towers destruction and are calling for a
grand jury investigation of NIST officials.
The newspaper reports that Richard Gage, the spokesperson for the architects
and engineers said:
Government officials will be notified that Misprision
of Treason, U.S. Code 18 (Sec. 2382) is a serious federal offense, which
requires those with evidence of treason to act. The implications are
enormous and may have profound impact on the forthcoming Khalid Sheik
Mohammed trial.
There is now an organization,
Firefighters for 9/11 Truth.
At the main press
conference in San Francisco, Eric Lawyer, the head of that organization,
announced the firefighters support for the architects and engineers
demands. He reported that no forensic investigation was made of the fires
that are alleged to have destroyed the three buildings and that this failure
constitutes a crime.
Mandated procedures were not followed, and instead of being preserved and
investigated, the crime scene was destroyed. He also reported that there are
more than one hundred first responders who heard and experienced explosions
and that there is radio, audio and video evidence of explosions.
Also at the press conference, physicist Steven Jones presented the evidence
of nano-thermite in the residue of the WTC buildings found by an
international panel of scientists led by University of Copenhagen
nano-chemist
Professor Niels Harrit.
Nano-thermite is a high-tech explosive/pyrotechnic
capable of instantly melting steel girders.
Before we yell conspiracy theory, we should be aware that the architects,
engineers, firefighters, and scientists offer no theory. They provide
evidence that challenges the official theory. This evidence is not going to
go away.
If expressing doubts or reservations about the official story in the
9/11
Commission Report makes a person a conspiracy theory kook, then we have to
include both co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission and the Commissions legal
counsel, all of whom have written books in which they clearly state that
they were lied to by government officials when they conducted their
investigation, or, rather, when they presided over the investigation
conducted by executive director Philip Zelikow, a member of President
George
W. Bushs transition team and Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and a
co-author of Bush Secretary of State Condi Mushroom Cloud Rice.
There will always be Americans who will believe whatever the government
tells them no matter how many times they know the government has lied to
them.
Despite expensive wars that,
-
threaten Social Security and Medicare
-
wars based on non-existent Iraqi weapons of mass destruction
-
non-existent
Saddam Hussein connections to al Qaida
-
non-existent Afghan participation in
the 9/11 attacks
-
non-existent Iranian nukes that are being hyped as
the reason for the next American war of aggression in the Middle East,
...more
than half of the U.S. population still believes the fantastic story that the
government has told them about
9/11, a Muslim conspiracy that outwitted the
entire Western world.
Moreover, it doesnt matter to these Americans how often the government
changes its story.
For example, Americans first heard of
Osama bin Laden
because the Bush regime pinned the 9/11 attacks on him. Over the years video
after video was served up to the gullible American public of bin Ladens
pronouncements. Experts dismissed the videos as fakes, but Americans
remained their gullible selves.
Then suddenly last year a new 9/11
mastermind emerged to take bin Ladens place, the captive Khalid Sheik
Mohammed, the detainee waterboarded 183 times until he confessed to
mastermining the 9/11 attack.
In the Middle Ages confessions extracted by torture constituted evidence,
but self-incrimination has been a no-no in the U.S. legal system since our
founding. But with the Bush regime and the Republican federal judges, whom
we were assured would defend the U.S. Constitution, the self-incrimination
of Sheik Mohammed stands today as the only evidence the U.S. government has
that Muslim terrorists pulled off 9/11.
If a person considers the feats attributed to Khalid Sheik Mohammed, they
are simply unbelievable.
Sheik Mohammed is a more brilliant, capable
superhero than V in the fantasy movie, V for Vendetta. Sheik Mohammed
outwitted all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies along with those of all U.S.
allies or puppets, including Israels Mossad...
No intelligence service on
earth or all of them combined was a match for Sheik Mohammed.
Sheik Mohammed outwitted the U.S. National Security Council, Dick Cheney,
the Pentagon, the State Department, NORAD, the U.S. Air Force, and Air
Traffic Control.
He caused Airport Security to fail four times in one morning. He caused the
state-of-the-art air defenses of the Pentagon to fail, allowing a hijacked
airliner, which was off course all morning while the U.S. Air Force, for the
first time in history, was unable to get aloft intercepter aircraft, to
crash into the Pentagon.
Sheik Mohammed was able to perform these feats with unqualified pilots.
Sheik Mohammed, even as a waterboarded detainee, has managed to prevent the
FBI from releasing the many confiscated videos that would show, according to
the official story, the hijacked airliner hitting the Penagon.
How naive do you have to be to believe that any human, or for that matter
Hollywood fantasy character, is this powerful and capable?
If Sheik Mohammed has these superhuman capabilities, how did the incompetent
Americans catch him? This guy is a patsy tortured into confession in order
to keep the American naives believing the governments conspiracy theory.
What is going on here is that the U.S. government has to bring the 9/11
mystery to an end. The government must put on trial and convict a culprit so
that it can close the case before it explodes. Anyone waterboarded 183 times
would confess to anything.
The U.S. government has responded to the evidence being arrayed against its
outlandish 9/11 conspiracy theory by redefining the war on terror from
external to internal enemies. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano
said on February 21 that American extremists are now as big a concern as
international terrorists. Extremists, of course, are people who get in the
way of the governments agenda, such as the 1,000 Architects and Engineers
for 9/11 Truth. The group used to be 100, now it is 1,000. What if it
becomes 10,000?
Cass Sunstein, an
Obama regime official, has a solution for the 9/11
skeptics:
Infiltrate them and provoke them into statements and actions that
can be used to discredit or to arrest them. But get rid of them at all cost.
-
Why employ such extreme measures against alleged kooks if they only provide
entertainment and laughs?
-
Is the government worried that they are on to
something?
-
Instead, why doesnt the U.S. government simply confront the evidence that
is presented and answer it?
If the architects, engineers, firefighters, and scientists are merely kooks,
it would be a simple matter to acknowledge their evidence and refute it. Why
is it necessary to infiltrate them with police agents and to set them up?
Many Americans would reply that their government would never even dream of
killing Americans by hijacking airliners and destroying buildings in order
to advance a government agenda. But on February 3, National Intelligence
Director Dennis Blair told the House Intelligence Committee that the U.S.
government can assassinate its own citizens when they are overseas.
No
arrest, trial, or conviction of a capital crime is necessary. Just straight
out murder.
Obviously, if the U.S. government can murder its citizens abroad it can
murder them at home, and has done so. For example,
100 Branch Davidians were
murdered in Waco, Texas, by the Clinton administration for no legitimate
reason.
The government just decided to use its power knowing that it could
get away with it, which it did.
Americans who think their government is some kind of morally pure
operation would do well to familiarize themselves with
Operation Northwoods.
Operation Northwoods was a plot drawn up by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff
for the CIA to commit acts of terrorism in American cities and fabricate
evidence blaming Castro so that the U.S. could gain domestic and
international support for regime change in Cuba.
The secret plan was nixed
by President John F. Kennedy and was declassified by the John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Review Board. It is
available online in the National
Security Archive.
There are numerous online accounts available, including Wikipedia.
James Bamfords book,
Body of Secrets, also summarizes the plot:
Operation Northwoods, which had the written approval of the Chairman [Gen.
Lemnitzer] and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for
innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees
fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to
be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere.
People would be
framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using
phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer
and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing,
they needed to launch their war.
Prior to 9/11 the American neoconservatives were explicit that the wars of
aggression that they intended to launch in the Middle East required a new
Pearl Harbor.
For their own good and that of the wider world, Americans need to pay
attention to the growing body of experts who are telling them that the
governments account of 9/11 fails their investigation. 9/11 launched the
neoconservative plan for U.S. world hegemony.
As I write the U.S. government
is purchasing the agreement of foreign governments that border Russia to
accept U.S. missile interceptor bases. The U.S. intends to
ring Russia with
U.S. missile bases from Poland through central Europe and Kosovo
to Georgia, Azerbaijan and central Asia.
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke declared on February 20 that al Qaida is moving into former
central Asian constituent parts of the Soviet Union, such as Tajikistan,
Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan.
Holbrooke is
soliciting U.S. bases in these former Soviet republics under the guise of
the ever-expanding war on terror.
The U.S. has already encircled Iran with military bases. The U.S. government
intends to neutralize China by seizing control over the Middle East and
cutting China off from oil.
This plan assumes that Russia and China, nuclear armed states, will be
intimidated by U.S. anti-missile defenses and acquiesce to U.S. hegemony and
that China will lack oil for its industries and military.
The U.S. government is delusional.
Russian military and political leaders
have responded to the obvious threat by declaring NATO a direct threat to
the security of Russia and by announcing a change in Russian war doctrine to
the pre-emptive launch of nuclear weapons. The Chinese are too confident to
be bullied by a washed up American superpower.
The morons in Washington are pushing the envelop of nuclear war.
The insane
drive for American hegemony threatens life on earth. The American people, by
accepting the lies and deceptions of their government, are facilitating
this outcome.
