If you told somebody 10 years ago that there existed some sort of secret group or "secret government" pulling the strings behind the scenes of government policy, international law, various global rules/regulations, and more, they would have called you a "conspiracy theorist."
Today things have changed, largely as a result of information leaked by Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, and various other whistleblowers and activists in recent years. All of this exists in what's become known as the "black budget world" - a world so secretive that its operations, known as Special Access Programs, or Unacknowledged Special Access, remain hidden from Congress and are exempt from reporting to Congress.
The National Security Agency (NSA) was founded in 1952, but its existence was hidden until the mid 1960s. Even more secretive is the National Reconnaissance Office, which was founded in 1960 but remained completely secret for 30 years.
The United States was built on secrecy.
According to John F. Kennedy:
For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence - on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match. source

Is this the world where the "Men In Black" (MIB) come from?
Multiple presidents and politicians have alluded to the existence of a "secret government."
For example, the 26th President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, stated that,
"behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people."
The 28th President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, stated that,
"some of the biggest men in the United States" are "afraid of something," of a "power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it."
Another great quote comes to mind here, from Edward Bernays' book Propaganda 1928:
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.

President Eisenhower, too, coined the term "military industrial complex," and referred to the dangerous potential for the rise of misplaced power it had created.
Today, within the mainstream, this subtle hand that influence the realms of politics, finance, and more is becoming known as the "Deep State."
The Men in Black
Just as the "Deep State" has now become almost mainstream rhetoric, "men in dark suits" is another one that's creeping into the picture, thanks to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.
A couple of months ago in a live interview, Putin said:
"So a person is elected, he comes with his ideas. Then people with briefcases come to visit him, well dressed, in dark suits, kind of like mine. Except instead of a red tie it's black or navy. And then they explain what to do, and the whole rhetoric changes, you see? This happens from one administration to the next."

And then they explain what to do, and the whole rhetoric changes, you see? This happens from one administration to the next."
Was Putin referring to representatives of the Deep State?
It makes you wonder how many decisions over the years were actually made by presidents, and how many were dictated to them, their hands forced by other people.
What is really going on within politics? Clearly, it's not what we've been told.
One thing is for sure, Hillary was the favorite of this global group of elites, which is why they are doing everything they can to have Donald Trump removed.
He has caused a lot of problems by,
dismantling the TPP speaking out against Big Pharma making comments about 9/11 calling out his own government for creating and funding ISIS,
dismantling the TPP
speaking out against Big Pharma
making comments about 9/11
calling out his own government for creating and funding ISIS,
...among other things.
That being said, he has made it very easy for mainstream media to vilify him, but regardless of your feelings about him, he clearly isn't cooperating with the Deep State the way Bush, Obama, and Clinton did.
Presidents have long been tools for the hand that really controls American policy, one that continues to push forth its agenda for a New World Order.
As for Medvedev, when asked about the UFO/ET issue after a television broadcast, possibly unaware that the camera was still rolling, he stated:
I tell you the first and last time. Together with nuclear suitcase the president bring folder - Top Secret. And it is entirely devoted to the strangers who visited our planet. The report is provided by the special service which handles the control of aliens in our country. After management term - two folders and a nuclear small suitcase are transferred to the new president. How many of them are among us I cannot say because panic might begin. source

The best person to refer to when discussing this topic is Nick Redfern, an author, lecturer, and journalist who published a book titled The Real Men in Black, which provides evidence and anecdotal accounts of these mysterious men, with a specific focus on their connection to the UFO phenomenon.
Here's a little excerpt from the introduction of his book:
For years - or perhaps even for centuries, as I will later - the Men in Black have been elusive, predatory, fear-inducing figures, hovering with disturbing regularity upon the enigmatic fringes of the UFO subject, nurturing their own unique brand of terror and intimidation. Like true specters from the outer edge, the MIB appear from the murky darkness, and roam the country-side provoking carnage, chaos, paranoia, and fear in their wake, before returning to that same shrouded realm from which they originally oozed. Very often traveling in groups of three, the MIB are a trinity of evil that seemingly appears and vanishes at will. They are often seen (in the United States) driving 1950s-style black Cadillacs and (in the British Isles) 1960s-era black Jaguars, both of which are almost always described as looking curiously brand-new. The preferred mode of dress of these sinister characters is a black suit, black fedora - or Homburg-style hat - black sunglasses, black necktie, black socks, black shoes, and a crisp, shining, white shirt.

Below is a picture taken from Redferns' book of a strange figure seen by a woman named Mary Robertson in 1968, a woman who became increasingly afraid of this figure, which 'stalked' her for three days.

The photo was taken by her friend, Timothy Green Beckley.
According to Beckley:
I had my own experience with a Man in Black, when me and Jim Moseley photographed a strange individual one day back in 1968. ...Marry told me and Jim he seemed to be oddly dressed, and kind of like a zombie - just standing there, very rigid. She had never engaged him in dialog but he seemed to be surveying those going in and out of the building.

You can refer to the book for that story, as it's one of many.
The most interesting thing, to me, is their connection to the UFO phenomenon. The book details UFO witnesses and contactees having these strange men show up out of nowhere after an experience.
How did they know? What was going on there?
There is also a distinction made between Department of Defense type of intelligence officers, and the MIB. The MIB don't seem to be part of any known agency.
There is something very paranormal about these guys.
A few years ago, the Aerial Phenomenon investigations team in MD investigated a case captured on hotel CCTV following a UFO report. It made its way around the web and caused quite the stir, and multiple media outlets picked up on it, including Buzzfeed.
These are the types of strange encounters that seem to keep happening throughout history.
Another story we've covered regarding the MIB comes from the U.S. government's Stargate Program, which lasted more than two decades.
The program studied various topics within parapsychology such as,
telepathy psychokinesis remote viewing,
telepathy
psychokinesis
remote viewing,
...and more.
A man named Ingo Swann was one of the main participants within the program who had 'special abilities.'
Below is a picture of Ingo (right) with Paul Smith, PhD., another participant in the Stargate project, and now a retired US Army Major.
One day, a strange man entered into the secured facility at Stanford - not an easy thing to do.
He found Swann and persuaded him to leave with him.
The man, named 'Mr. Axelrod,' was accompanied by two twins, who were very tall and mysterious. They dressed in the typical 'cloak and dagger' intelligence agency outfit.
Swann described them as,
"two blond haired, blue eyed, military looking assistants."
The four of them flew to what Swann believed to be the Alaskan wilderness, although he wasn't certain and was told that it's best he did not know. More here...
Richard Dolan, one of the world's foremost authorities on the topic of UFOs, describes the incident well in his book UFOs and The National Security State - The Cover-Up Exposed 1973-1991, so I will quote it from here on in, starting on page 154:
They came to a small lake, and Axelrod said that as dawn approached, Swann would be able to see "it" through the pines. "We now wait and hope we are lucky. Say nothing, do not make any noise they detect heat, noise, motion like mad." Dawn arrived, and Swann saw a fog developing over the lake. This went on for five minutes, until the fog developed a luminous neon-blue color. Then, according to Swann, the color changed to an "angry purple." Axelrod and one of the twins each placed a hand firmly on Swann's shoulders while, "a network of purple, red, and yellow lightning bolts shot in all crazy directions through the 'cloud'." Swann said he would have jumped if the two had not held him down. He saw an object, almost transparent at first, but then "solidly visible over the lake." It was triangular or diamond-shaped, growing in size. Swann, in terror and amazement, heard a strong wind moving past, rustling the pine trees so much that some cones and branches fell on them. The object then began to shoot out "ruby red laser-like beams" as it continued to grow even more in size while maintaining its position on the lake. Very quietly, one of the twins said, "Shit! They're enveloping the area. They're going to spot us." As Swann later recalled the event, some of the red laser beams from the object were "blasting" pine trees, and he could hear low frequency pulsations. Axelrod whispered to Swann that the beams were probably honing in on deer or other forest creatures, as they sense biological body heat. "They're sure to hone in on us," he told Swann. Just then, one of the twins literally lifted and dragged Swann away, but not before Swann noticed the water of the lake surging upward, "like a waterfall going upward, as if being sucked into the 'machine'." The four ran quickly and at great length, sustaining minor cuts and bruises. Eventually they stopped, breathing hard, and waited for more than thirty minutes, until one of the twins said all was clear. Axelrod then asked Swann whether he could "sense" anything from the craft.

Axelrod then asked Swann whether he could "sense" anything from the craft.
It's clear why Swann was taken from his position and role at Stanford Research Institute and into this situation.
It seems these 'government' agents believed Swann could provide some detail about what was happening here and help the government with their research and interest in UFOs.
Swann burst out laughing. "You're completely nuts, Axel! I have to be calm, cool, collected, and in good shape to sense anything." But Swann offered the insight that the craft was, "a drone of some kind, unmanned, controlled from somewhere else." Axelrod asked him what it was doing there, to which Swann replied, "Well, for chrissakes! It was thirsty! Taking on water, obviously. Someone, somewhere needs water so I suppose they just come and get it. You don't need to be a psychic to see that." Essentially, said Swann, "they" treated Earth as the neighborhood supermarket. Before taking Swann back, Axelrod said, "I shouldn't tell you, but our mission will be disbanded shortly and the work picked up by others, because of strategic security reasons involved " "Others," said Swann, "who will not mix in with psychics, I take it." "You got it," Axelrod replied. Swann last saw Axelrod at the San Jose Airport, and never heard from him again.
