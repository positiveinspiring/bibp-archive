The assets (real) of the World have been hidden from view from 1946 to 1995 and abused by certain countries who would prefer it remained as such.
The system is broken and Bretton Woods is a shadow of what was Agreed! You are not slaves even though governments would prefer you in bondage for their own purposes.
To undo 50 years abuse takes time and against the will of those that would prefer to keep you in chains. But knowledge will set you FREE... What can be made public is the tip of the iceberg so understand this and the knowledge of a few good men can made things start to happen. From 1944/5-1994/5 The Trilateral Trillenium Tripartite Gold Commission (TTTGC - USA, France and UK) was organized and implemented, by the Nations of the World, with a Term period of Fifty (50) years.
During this term period the Commission held the Mandate, Rights and Authorities over The Combined International Collateral Accounts of the Global Debt Facility.
(Note: This Commission should not be confused with the Trilateral Commission that exists today).
Following the expiry of the 50 year term, the Nations of the World, disappointed with the biased way The Combined International Collateral Accounts had been utilized within the 50 years, agreed not to extend the term of the TTTGC, but instead appointed a single independent person to the position of International Treasury Controller with full rights, authority, and legal ownership of the Combined International Collateral Accounts. On January 20th 1995, Dr. Ray C. Dam was appointed International Treasury Controller, and Legal Heir and Owner of the Combined International Collateral Accounts of the Global Debt Facility, with full authority and dispositional control of same, under Legal Decadency RCD 1088, executed by the Nations of the World.
Also established on January 20, 1995 was The Office of International Treasury Control, as the management, administrative and operations organization for His Excellency, Dr. Ray C. Dam. Dr. Ray C. Dam is a person, but His Excellency Dr. Ray C. Dam is a certified and indemnified international Central Banking financial institution operating as The Office of International Treasury Control (OITC). Following the confirmation of the Powers and Authorities of His Excellency Dr. Ray C. Dam by the Washington Panel in 1998, the establishment of the Institution - The Office of International Treasury Control - was completed on January 20, 2003, whereby, based upon the content and requirements of numerous International Treaties, The Office of International Treasury Control was granted Sovereign Entity Status under the United Nations Charter Control No: 10-60847. Though not generally or publicly known, OITC is the largest International Institution of its kind.
It is the largest single owner of gold and platinum bullion in the World, in addition to being a major owner of Bank Debenture Securities, International Treasuries, Cash and other forms of securities, all of which are recorded as assets of the Combined International Collateral Accounts of the Global Debt Facility, whose accounts are held within
The Federal Reserve The Bank for International Settlements The US Treasury Swiss National Bank Swiss Federal Finance Administration
The Federal Reserve
The Bank for International Settlements
The US Treasury
Swiss National Bank
Swiss Federal Finance Administration
Since being established, the OITC has become the largest single owner of Home Mortgage Securities in the World today. Original assets in the form of gold have been wisely and well utilized to create wealth that creates further wealth. The Assets of the Combined International Collateral Accounts are in constant use, assisting to finance countries and such organizations, either in part or full, as,
The International Monetary Fund The World Bank The International Finance Corporation International Development Banks United Nations and additionally under-pinning the US Dollar as the Worlds Reserve Currency
The International Monetary Fund
The World Bank
The International Finance Corporation
International Development Banks
United Nations
and additionally under-pinning the US Dollar as the Worlds Reserve Currency
So as to protect the assets, as well as protecting Dr. Ray C. Dam (International Treasury Controller), together with all other persons involved, full International Protection and Immunity under Full Jacket Security Level 3-5 was applied, attested and affirmed under the Great Seal of America (No: 632-258894) on behalf of the International Community, together and conjointly with Sovereign Entity Status under the United Nations. It should be noted that only a few persons in each country of the world are eligible to be able to verify, or undertake a verification, re: the position of Dr. Ray C. Dam (International Treasury Controller) and the Office of International Treasury Control.
Such persons are limited to Kings, Queens, Presidents, Prime Ministers, with Ministers of Finance and Ministers of Foreign Affairs subject to security status and special conditions/dispensation.
For anyone, other than those persons referred to above, to attempt to undertake verification would be futile and would result in deliberate misinformation on same, or no response at all.
Additionally, Classified information is not available, and never will be, on or through the www or various Web Sites which are totally unregulated, uncontrolled, and legally void, whereby reference to such Web Sites will only reveal speculations, innuendoes, comments from the uninformed, deliberate propaganda and misinformation, or similar.
YOU ARE THEREFORE ADVISED NOT TO UTILIZE THE WWW OR VARIOUS WEB SITES FOR ANY FORM OF VERIFICATION AS IT IS NOT OFFICIAL, NOR IS IT A PROFESSIONAL METHOD OF VERIFICATION, NOR WILL IT GIVE YOU ANY CORRECT OR ACCURATE INFORMATION.

Statements of Fact
The Tripartite Gold Commission ...established under the Bretton Woods Agreement for a single term of 50 years, ceased operations in 1994 and was formerly wound up in 1997, after having fulfilled its life term. The World Governments via their respective interests in the Bank for International Settlements, appointed a Sole Arbiter to succeed the Commission on January 20, 1995. All assets deemed to be held under the Commissions Trustee were ceded and transferred to the Ownership of the Sole Arbiter, thereby granting unrestricted and absolute control to the Sole Arbiter. His Excellency, Dr. Ray C. Dam, ...is the appointed and empowered person holding full disposition rights and authority over said assets and accounts by virtue of the authority vested in him by the Governments of the World, whom he represents, such authority being chartered and then registered with the United Nations. As Chairman ...of the said Trust and Foundation and Sole Arbiter and Lawful Owner of all the assets held within Foundation Divine and the Heritage International Trust and their internal and ancillary Trusts, Foundations and Corporations, such Ownership granted to him by the International Community on January 20, 1995, His Excellency Dr. Ray C. Dam holds the absolute right to determine and make ruling, such ruling to be enforced (if necessary) by the Justice Department of the United States of America.

Decisions/Determinations made by H.E. Dr. Ray C. Dam in respect of the Combined International Collateral Accounts of the Global Debt Facility, take precedence over all / any laws, adjudications, Legal Rulings, or similar, determined by any Court of any other Country, including the The International Courts (World Courts). Under International Control Number 10-60847, ...the right of control is established and Chartered by Treaty Agreement between all Nations, then registered with the United Nations as a sovereign entity that is to be beyond all other jurisdictional controls. This creation of a sovereign jurisdiction of control preserves and protects the official independence of the appointed and empowered person, His Excellency Dr. Ray C. Dam, his heirs and successors.

It is an Institutional Bank held within the Federal Reserve. It will not be found within the "Bankers Almanac", "The Banker", or any other Professional Handbook. Few organizations ...have been so publicly attacked and maligned as The Office of International Treasury Control (OITC), by intensive and extensive disinformation campaigns, gossip, innuendoes, and the likes. Much of this is expanded by public perception and failures in total understanding that is further fueled by Levels of Secrecy that are imposed upon OITC, ignorance, political influence, even fear, or similar issues. All Governments are advised to stay with proper procedures and protocols and to conduct any undertaking for verification of the real existence of H.E. Dr. Ray C. Dam (International Treasury Controller), the OITC in compliance with such procedures and protocols, and to disregard internet gossip and reports, articles, or similar, to the contrary.
