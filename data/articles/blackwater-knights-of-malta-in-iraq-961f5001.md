The Knights of Malta are the militia of the
Pope, and are sworn to total obedience by a blood oath which is taken
extremely seriously and to the death. The Pope as the head of the Vatican is
also the head of a foreign national power.
-Encyclopedia of Freemasonry and Its Kindred Sciences by Albert G. Mackey
33rd degree Mason, published by the Masonic History Company, Chicago, New
York, & London, 1925: (Volume One, pp. 392-95)
The painful saga of modern Arab-Muslim history evokes the battles fought in
Crusades of the 11th century when the Knights of Malta began their
operations as a Christian militia whose mission it was to defend the land
conquered by the Crusaders.
These memories return violently to mind with the
discovery of links between the so-called security firms in Iraq such as Blackwater have historic links with the Order of Malta. You cannot
exaggerate it. The Order of Malta is a hidden government or the most
mysterious government in the world.
- Jordanian MP Jamal Muhammad Abidat, from an editorial in the United Arab
Emirates daily Al-Bayan entitled The Knights of Malta - more than a
conspiracy. Abidat describes the role played by the Knights of Malta during
the Crusades, and that the Order is playing a similar role in the Middle
East today, citing the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Blackwater is more than just a private army, much more than just another
capitalist war-profiteering business operation.
It is an army operating
outside all laws,
outside and above the US Constitution and yet is
controlled by people within and outside our government whose allegiance is
primarily to the foreign Vatican state. In other words, Blackwater is a
religious army serving the Pope in Rome through the Order of Malta, which is
itself considered under international law, as a sovereign entity with
special diplomatic powers and privileges.
Like Blackwater, the Order of
Malta is untouchable because it is at the heart of the elite aristocracy.
Knight of Malta Amschel Mayer Rothschild (17441812)
The Knights of Malta is not merely a charitable organization.
Thats just
an elaborate front, as should become clear to you later. As the name
Sovereign Military Order of Malta confirms, it is a military order based on
the crusader Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem and is interwoven with
Freemasonry. Most people have never even heard of SMOM, much less that it is
a part of Freemasonry. But that is the way the aristocratic elite like it.
One of the symbols of the military orders of the Vatican,
the
masonic double-headed eagle emblazoned with the Maltese cross, signifies
omnipotent royal dominion over both East and West. The orb signifies
temporal dominion over the globe of Earth, and the scepter signifies control
over the spiritual and religious impulses of humanity.
This eagle symbol is
used in the
masonic rite of Memphis and Misraim, under which it reads,
Order Out of Chaos, the Hegelian method of crisis creation. It is found on
the seals of many European and Eurasian nation states including that of
Russia, indicating direct Vatican control over those countries.
It
symbolizes the desire of a predatory elite with virtually unlimited
resources, to totally dominate the entire world under a New World Order
global government system using secrecy, manipulation, coercion and terror
with the ends justifying the means.
Double-Headed Eagle
Symbol
The
two-headed eagle emblem of the Byzantine Empire (Roman Empire) on a
Red
Shield was adopted in 1743 by the infamous goldsmith Amschel Moses Bauer. He
opened a coin shop in Frankfurt, Germany and hung above his door this Roman
eagle on a red shield.
The shop became known as the Red Shield firm. The
German word for red shield is Rothschild. After this point,
the Rothschilds became the bankers to kings and pontiffs alike, among the
richest families in the world.
Ever since, they have financed both sides of
every major war and revolution using the Hegelian Dialectic to engineer
society toward their New World Order.
The Rothschilds and their agents, such as
the Rockefellers, have been
engineering America and its foreign policy almost since its inception.
They
and their
Skull and Bones Wall Street partners staged and funded both sides
in WWII, and out of that hellish nightmare was born their infant global
government, the United Nations, and their tool of tyranny, the CIA.
The
father of the CIA, Wild Bill Donovan, was a Knight of Malta. In order to
be a director of the CIA you must be a crusading Knight of Malta and it
doesnt hurt if you are a member of Skull and Bones either.
In order to
reach the highest levels in the Pentagon establishment, you must be an
illuminated Freemason and/or a Knight of one order or another. Notable US
military members of SMOM include top crusading generals such as Alexander
Haig, William Westmoreland, and Charles A. Willoughby, an admitted Fascist.
Other notable members include:
Such a list should make you sit up and pay attention, but it is only the tip
of the iceberg unfortunately.
Then we come to another SMOM member, important
to what is transpiring in Iraq. Educated at the Jesuit Georgetown
University, former Pentagon Inspector General Joseph Edward Schmitz, Blackwaters operations chief, is a member of both
SMOM and Opus Dei.
Former Pentagon Inspector General Joseph Edward Schmitz quit in 2005 to work
for Blackwater. He is a member of Opus Dei and Knights of Malta.
The Knights of Malta in Iraq?
Malta Star
Sep 29, 2007
An American investigative journalist compared the US firm Blackwater, the
biggest security services provider in post war Iraq, to the Knights of
Malta.
The company is currently in the midst of a controversy after some of its
20,000 personnel stationed in Iraq killed a number of civilians.
In his book,
Blackwater: The Rise of the Worlds Most Powerful Mercenary
Army, Jeremy Scahill links the modern security firm to the Knights of
Malta.
The writer argues that Blackwaters employees
share the same religious
zeal of ancient crusaders, the Egyptian weekly newspaper Al-Ahram reported.
All the top Nazis in our government are connected in some way to
the
Vatican,
Jesuits and
Knights of Malta and have been for decades, as were the
Italian Fascists and German Nazis of WWII.
After all, what was their
favorite symbol after the swastika? The Maltese Cross of course!
Catholic Nazi Connections
These SMOM knights are behind most of the trouble in the world and they must
be exposed as the criminals that they are. They are not nice people helping
the poor, though they use good people in the lower ranks as useful idiots.
They are behind:
...and seek
to completely enslave the human species in a
global Big Brother totalitarian
regime as they kill off the majority of us in the process.
In fact, all of
it has either come to pass or is in the process of being implemented. We are
on the brink of WWIII which has been entirely staged by these profoundly
evil men. Therefore, we have no time left for pussyfooting around.
But dont take my word for it, do you your own research, find out and expose
them yourself before these dirty Blackwater mercenary thugs are allowed to
patrol American streets and confiscate guns during the next staged disaster.
We cant let this happen in America.

Order of The Knights of Malta

Freemasonry in Malta.
Many knights of the Order of St. John and some of the Maltese nobility were
freemasons. In 1756, the Grand Master of the Order was a freemason named E.
Pinto de Fonseca.
De Rohan, who was Grandmaster of the Order of St. John
between 1775 and 1797, is reported also to have been a freemason, and is
said to have helped the spread of freemasonry in Malta
This lodge noted in
its petition that the most important members of the Order of St. John ranked
amongst its membership.
The lodge obtained an English warrant as
the Lodge
of St. John of Secrecy and Harmony.
The Rite of Misraïm
Since 1738, one can find traces of
this Rite filled with alchemical, occult
and Egyptian references, with a structure of 90 degrees.
Joseph Balsamo,
called
Cagliostro, a key character of his time, known how to give it the
impulse necessary for its development. Very close to the Grand Master of the
Order of the Knights of Malta, Manual Pinto de Fonseca, Cagliostro founded
the Rite of High Egyptian Masonry in 1784.
He received, between 1767 and
1775, from Sir Knight Luigi dAquino, the brother of the national Grand
Master of Neapolitan Masonry, the Arcana Arcanorum, three very high hermetic
degrees.
In 1788, he introduced them into the Rite of Misraïm and gave a
patent to this Rite.

The picture that proves torture flights are STILL landing in the UK (and
Malta)
The European Parliament report describes these as shell companies operating
as subsidiaries of Blackwater USA,
an important contractor for the CIA and
the US military which bases the planes in Malta (click below image).
Tracking technology shows
that the plane was en route from Canada to Greenland two days before it was
sighted at Mildenhall: the internet software does not extend beyond American
airspace, but the expert explained that its route would be consistent with a
refueling stop in the Arctic - it only has a range of about 2,000 miles -
followed by a further refuel in East Anglia, before heading to Malta.
Malta is Blackwaters operational base
A European Parliament
working document drawn up by Giovanni Claudio Fava has
claimed,
Malta is the operational base of Blackwater, the
organizer of
private military militia which are increasingly taking on more and more
roles which used to be undertaken by US forces in Iraq and elsewhere.
In
2004, Cofer Black passed from CIA to the State Department and thence became Blackwaters vice-president.
While still in the CIA, Black was in charge of
the special extraditions organizing the secret transfer of prisoners from
Iraq or Afghanistan to countries less rigid against the practice of torture,
such as Poland, Romania, Egypt, and so on. These planes, which traveled
between Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and Afghanistan often made stopovers in many
European countries such as the UK, Italy, France, Germany and Malta many
times without the countries themselves being informed what was going on.
Now
the Swiss procurator Dick Marty has sent documents regarding the CIAs
flying prisons to the European Parliament and names two Blackwater
subsidiaries:

First it became a brand name in security for its
work in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Now its taking on intelligence.
The Prince Group, the holding
company that owns Blackwater Worldwide, has been building an operation that
will sniff out intelligence about natural disasters, business-friendly
governments, overseas regulations and global political developments for
clients in industry and government.
The operation, Total Intelligence
Solutions, has assembled a roster of former spooks - high-ranking figures
from agencies such as the CIA and defense intelligence - that mirrors the
slate of former military officials who run Blackwater.
Its chairman is Cofer
Black, the former head of counterterrorism at CIA known for his leading role
in many of the agencys more controversial programs, including the rendition
and interrogation of al-Qaeda suspects and the detention of some of them in
secret prisons overseas.
Bushs Shadow Army
Blackwater has repeatedly cited Rumsfelds statement that contractors are
part of the Total Force as evidence that it is a legitimate part of the
nations warfighting capability and capacity.
Invoking Rumsfelds
designation, the company has in effect declared its forces above the law -
entitled to the immunity from civilian lawsuits enjoyed by the military, but
also not bound by the militarys court martial system.
While the initial
inquiries into Blackwater have focused on the complex labyrinth of secretive
subcontracts under which it operates in Iraq, a thorough investigation into
the company reveals a frightening picture of a politically connected private
army that has become the Bush Administrations Praetorian Guard.
Blackwaters impunity
Neither Iraqi nor U.S. laws apply to its contractors, so a controversial
shooting may go unpunished.
"They
can get away with murder" has been the cry
of critics of hiring private companies such as Blackwater to provide
security for the U.S. military and diplomats in Iraq and other war zones.
Now it looks as though the critics may be right - and in the worst way.
Knights of Malta
The
Sovereign Military Order of Malta, also known as the original
Sovereign
Military Order of St. John of Jerusalem, is a closed fraternity of
the Roman
Catholic Church (click below image).
Pope Benedict with SMOM Grandmaster Andrew Willoughby Ninian Bertie
Its initiated members must be Catholic and have served in
the military. They participate in secret ceremonies and feudal ritual dress,
and embrace a strong class/caste mentality as part of their initiation into
Rosicrucian dogma.
The upper grades are fastidiously aristocratic and must be able to display a
family coat-of-arms dating back at least 300 years in unbroken succession
from father to son. The Sovereign Grand Master of the order is recognized as
a head of state, and his authority is ensured by his secular ranking as a
Prince, and his ecclesiastical ranking as a Cardinal.
Under international
law this organization has independent Sovereign status, which assures
nationalistic loyalty from its members, above and beyond allegiance to their
own country - they also have Permanent Observer status at
the United Nations.
The current Grand Master, Andrew Willoughby Bertie, is descended from Mary
Stuart (Mary Queen of Scots) which places him firmly in the Sion/Grail
historical scenario.
The order and its members have been proven to be linked with the Rat Run,
the post-WWII escape route used by high-ranking Nazis and death camp
scientists from defeated Germany to the Americas.

passports were issued with false identities that allowed escape from
prosecution for war crimes.
The privatization of security in Iraq threatens more than innocent civilians
The
killing of 11 civilians in Baghdad two weeks ago has once again put Blackwater on the spot.
The US security firm first came into the public eye
in early April 2004, when four of its personnel were killed and mutilated by
mobs in Falluja. Although Iraqi religious parties denounced the attacks at
the time, Bush gave the town four days to deliver the perpetrators before
ordering an all-out attack, one in which thousands of Falluja inhabitants
perished.
In his book,
Blackwater - The Rise of the Worlds Most Powerful
Mercenary Army, American investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill links the
modern security firm to the Knights of Malta, an offshoot of the Knights
Templar.
Blackwaters employees, he argues, share the same religious zeal of
ancient crusaders.
US Theocons Fight Battle in Iraq
Many has been written about the privatization of the Iraq war, but in his
new bestseller book Jeremy Scahill sheds much needed light on the
ideological roots of the largest US private mercenary firm and its links to
the theocons and the Christian militia Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
Prince, writes Scahill, shows how,
politically powerful Christian
fundamentalists and Neocons are pressing forward with their battle for what
they call freedom and democracy.
He has connections with conservative
Catholic groups and funds rightwing organizations through his
Freiheit
Foundation.
Senior Blackwater executives such as Joseph Schmitz do not only
subscribe to the theocon ideology but are also members of the Sovereign
Military Order of Malta, a Christian militia that had a mission of defending
territories the Crusaders captured from Muslims.
Schmitz, says Scahill,
comes from one of the most bizarre, scandal-plagued,
right-wing political families in US history.
The Sovereign Military Order
of Malta began as a Christian charity in Al-Quds in 1080 to provide care for
poor and sick pilgrims to the Holy Land.
After the conquest of the holy city
in 1095 during the First Crusade it became a Catholic Military Order. After
the Muslims restored Al-Quds, the Order operated from Rhodes and later from
Malta where it administered a vassal state under the Spanish viceroy of
Sicily. The Orders fighters, known as the Knights Hospitaller, helped the
Crusaders in raids on Muslim countries near the coasts of Italy, including
Tunisia, Libya and Morocco.
The
Sovereign Military Order of Malta
is now a
state located in Rome and is recognized by 50 countries worldwide.
BLACKWATER CHIEF
JOSEPH E. SCHMITZ -
KNIGHT OF MALTA
Joseph Edward Schmitz is the son of the late John G. Schmitz, former
California State Senator, Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and
U.S. Presidential candidate (1972).
Columba Bushs sister is married to John
P. Schmitz, a beneficiary of the fellowship programs subsumed under the Carl Duisberg gesellschaft and the brother of Joseph Schmitz, currently the head
of the Blackwater security outfit.
John P. Schmitz has close links to the
elder George Bush, the 9/11 milieu
Ex-Pentagon IG Joseph Schmitz At Prince/Blackwater
Joseph Schmitz is active in the Washington Lawyers Chapter of the
right-wing Federalist Society, the same group with which the new Chief
Justice John G. Roberts was affiliated.
Schmitz is also a member of the
Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Schmitz was accused of covering up
several investigations into fraud, waste and abuse within the Rumsfeld
Pentagon.
Joseph E. Schmitz: Georgetown, Opus Dei and Sovereign Military Order of
Malta
Joseph Edward Schmitz is an American lawyer, former Inspector General of the
Department of Defense and executive with Blackwater USA, a private
contractor providing security services to the U.S. military.
Schmitz attended
Catholic schools as a child and Georgetown Preparatory School while his
father served in Congress. He is a member of Opus Dei and the Sovereign
Military Order of Malta.
General Joseph Schmitz member of the Sovereign Order of Malta
In addition to Prince,
A number of Blackwater executives are deeply
conservative Christians, including corruption-smeared former Pentagon
Inspector General Joseph Schmitz, who is also a member of the Sovereign
Order of Malta, which Scahill describes as a Christian militia formed in
the eleventh century [to defend] territories that the Crusaders had
conquered from the Moslems, Chris Barsanti wrote in a review of the book
for In These Times.
Blackwater USA is the brainchild of Erik Prince
- a
former Navy SEAL and son of Edgar Prince, a wealthy Michigan auto-parts
supplier - described by Scahill as a radical right wing Christian
mega-millionaire who is a strong financial backer of President
George W.
Bush, as well as a donor to a host of conservative Christian political
causes.
In the 1980s the Prince family merged with one of the most venerable
conservative families in the United States, when Eriks sister Betsy - nine
years his senior - married Dick DeVos, whose father Richard, founded the
multilevel marketing firm Amway.
The two families exercised enormous
political influence both inside and outside Michigan.
They were one of the
greatest bankrollers of far-right causes in U.S. history, and with their
money they propelled extremist Christian politicians and activists to
positions of prominence, Scahill writes.

Enemy bodies were
brutalized for plunder, not pleasure; cannibalism was
caused by starvation, not hatred; and crusaders happily had consensual sex
