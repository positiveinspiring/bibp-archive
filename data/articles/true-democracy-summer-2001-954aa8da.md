Elite weapons application scientists, developing cutting-edge science
weapons for DARPA, and operating under the cover of the Mitre Corporation. 1. BACKGROUND, CHARGE, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
What they are doing is developing genetics for war and operating in relative
secrecy.
They don't deserve to exist. The money which is spent on this project could
be put to use in a much more productive manner.
