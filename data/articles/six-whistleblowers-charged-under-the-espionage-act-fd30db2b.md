The
Obama administration has been carrying out
an unprecedented
crackdown on whistleblowers, particularly on those who have divulged
information that relates to national security.
The Espionage Act, enacted during the first World War to punish
Americans who aided the enemy, had only been used three times in its history
to try government officials accused of leaking classified information -
until the Obama administration.
Since 2009, the administration has used the
act to prosecute six government officials. Meet the whistleblowers.

Thomas Drake is a former senior executive at
the NSA who was charged under the Espionage Act for the unauthorized willful
retention of classified documents.
Drakes problems with the agency started
when he found himself on the minority side of a debate about two new tools
for collecting intelligence from digital sources.
-
One program, called
Trailblazer, was being built by an outside contractor for $1.2 billion
-
The
other, known as
ThinThread, was created in-house by a legendary
crypto-mathematician named Bill Binney for about $3 million
Then, in the wake of the attacks of Sept. 11
2001, the NSA, with the approval of the Bush administration, began the
illegal warrantless surveillance of American citizens.
This did not sit well
with Drake, who says that during his time in the Air Force, where he also
did surveillance work, the imperative to protect Americans privacy was
drilled into him.
If you accidentally intercepted U.S. persons, there were
special procedures to expunge it.
I was faced with a crisis of conscience, Drake
told
The New Yorkers Jane Mayer. What do I do - remain silent, and
complicit, or go to the press?
As a father of five, one of whom has serious
health problems, Drake concluded that hed go to the press with his
complaints about the NSA - but hed only share unclassified information,
thinking perhaps hed lose hes job but at least not end up in jail.
So he
leaked the story of
ThinThread vs. Trailblazer - a simple story of
government waste - to the Baltimore Sun. A few months later, the
FBI appeared at his door.
Drake at one point faced up to 35 years in prison
for various charges, most of which were dropped. He eventually pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor for exceeding authorized use of a computer.

In 2010, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, a specialist in
nuclear proliferation who worked as a contractor for the State Department,
pleaded not guilty to charges of leaking information about North Korea to
Fox News.
He was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury, but the case
has not yet been brought to trial.
Fox journalist James Rosen, with whom Kim had
been in touch in the past, reported in 2009 that North Korea would likely
test another nuclear missile in reaction to a pending United Nations
Security Council resolution condemning its nuclear tests. The Justice
Department said Kim was
Foxs source.
Kim, who immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea
when he was nine years old, told
Bloomberg News that,
to be accused of doing something against or
harmful to U.S. national interest is something I cant comprehend.
Kims
lawyers said that Kim was being charged for participating in the type of
exchange between experts and the press,
that happen hundreds of times a day
in Washington.
In its obsession to clamp down on perfectly
appropriate conversations between government employees and the press, the
Obama Administration has forgotten that wise foreign policy must be founded
on a two-way conversation between government and the public, his lawyers
said.

the names of covert operatives to journalists.

John Kiriakou, a former CIA agent, was
sentenced to two and a half years in prison for giving journalists the
names of two former colleagues who interrogated detainees using harsh
practices including waterboarding.
Kiriakou became central to the debate
surrounding interrogation tactics in 2007 with an interview on ABC News.
By
then, he had left the CIA and was working at the auditing firm Deloitte.
Like a lot of Americans, Im involved in this internal, intellectual battle
with myself weighing the idea that waterboarding may be torture versus the
quality of information that we often get after using the waterboarding
technique, and I struggle with it,
he
said in his ABC interview.
He suggested that our country should
abandon the technique because,
were Americans and were better than
this.
After the interview, Kiriakou was asked to leave
Deloitte but became a source for other journalists investigating torture.
Over the course of the next year
he gave the name of one former colleague to a freelance reporter and
gave the name of another former colleague to a reporter for The New York
Times.
He
pleaded guilty in October 2012 to the leak made to the freelancer; the
charge related to The New York Times was dropped.

Shamai K. Leibowitz, a former FBI Hebrew
translator and the grandson of Israeli philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz,
pleaded guilty to leaking classified information before a judge who later
said he
did not know exactly what Leibowitz had disclosed - just that it was
a very, very serious offense."
Leibowitz was sentenced to 20 months in prison.
Leibowitz had leaked 200 pages of transcribed
conversations recorded by FBI wiretaps of the Israeli embassy in Washington.
They documented discussions embassy officials had with American supporters
of Israel and at least one member of Congress - and a discussion among
Israeli officials in which they worry that their exchanges might be
monitored.
The leak was to a blogger, Richard Silverstein, who writes the
blog Tikun Olam promoting
peace between Israel and Palestine and monitoring U.S. government overreach.
Silverstein burned the transcripts when Leibowitz came under investigation.
In an interview with
The New York Times, Silverstein said that Leibowitz released
the transcripts because of Israels aggressive attempts to influence public
opinion in the U.S., and because Leibowitz worried that Israel would take
what he saw as the potentially disastrous step of bombing nuclear facilities
Iran.
I should not have done what I did, Leibowitz said at his sentencing,
and I regret it terribly.

Pfc. Bradley Manning admitted to leaking 700,000
government documents to
Wikileaks,
including videos of air strikes in Afghanistan and Iraq in which civilians
were killed.
Manning said one of the videos, from 2007, was particularly
disturbing to him - it showed
American Apache helicopters killing a dozen people in Baghdad, including
two Reuters journalists, and then opening fire on a van that
arrived to help the victims.
Manning noted the seemingly delightful blood
lust of the airmen.
Manning said in February that
his goal in releasing the materials was to show the public,
what happens
and why it happens.
I believed if the public - in particular the American
public - had access to the information in the reports, this could spark a
debate about foreign policy in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan, he said.
In 2010, while on leave, Manning first tried to
leak materials to The Washington Post, but felt the reporter he
spoke with was not interested.
He then left a message with the ombudsmans
office at The New York Times which was not returned. So he uploaded
the files to WikiLeaks. He
was arrested on May 29, 2010; his trial is set for June 3, 2013.
A military judge ruled earlier this month that
for Manning to be convicted under the Espionage Act, the prosecution
would have to prove that Manning had reason to believe that the files
could be used to harm the U.S. or to aid a foreign power.
Manning said
during his February confession that he thought carefully about the
information he was releasing, and felt nothing he leaked could be used to
harm the U.S.
Jeffrey Sterling
Jeffrey Sterling was accused
of
giving information to
journalist James Risen for his book 'State of
War.'
Jeffrey Sterling, a former-CIA officer,
pleaded not guilty to the charge that he leaked information about a U.S.
plan to sabotage Irans nuclear operations to Pulitzer Prize-winning New
York Times journalist James Risen for his book
'State of War.'
The book had a chapter on
a botched operation to derail Irans nuclear ambitions through sabotage,
and the Justice Department charged that Sterling had been Risens source.
Risen recounts how, in the early 2000s, the CIA
sent a Russian nuclear scientist to Iran
to leak flawed plans for a nuclear
bomb-triggering device in an attempt to set back the countrys efforts to
develop a bomb. But the flaw in the bomb plans was so obvious that the
Russian scientist spotted it immediately - the scientist then told the
Iranians that there was an obvious flaw in the plans so that they would take
him seriously.
Risens source felt the Iranians likely were able to learn
from the parts of the plans that werent flawed, and that the operation,
intended as sabotage, may have in fact brought Iran closer to developing a
nuclear weapon.
The CIA had suspected Sterling of leaking
information to Risen since 2002, when Risen wrote an article about the
effect racial discrimination had on Sterlings career.
In the article,
Sterling said he had repeatedly been passed over for advancement because he
is black - a superior once told him he was not an ideal spy because,
you
kind of stick out as a big black guy.
Sterling sued the CIA for racial discrimination in 2000.
After his arrest, Sterling maintained his
innocence, and Risen refused to reveal his confidential sources for his
book, citing the first amendment in a lengthy
affidavit.
As of summer 2012, the Justice Department says it has
effectively terminated the case.
