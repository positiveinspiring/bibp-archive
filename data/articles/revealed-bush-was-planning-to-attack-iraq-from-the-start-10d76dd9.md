George W. Bush
planned the Iraq war from the
first National Security Council meeting on, long before the 9/11 attacks
took place. This was revealed by Paul O'Neill, former Treasury Secretary
under George W. Bush in his book "The Price of Loyalty".
Although this story was already published in
2004, it got only little attention, although it is clearly very important.
This clip features excerpts of the interview that "60 minutes" conducted
with Paul O'Neill.
Take it from an insider:
George W. Bush wanted to attack
Iraq all along, and 9/11 just gave him the right excuse.
It's that simple.
The following generations will have to live with
the terrible consequences of these reckless actions.
From Wikipedia
The Price of Loyalty - George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of
Paul O'Neill, a 2004 book, described the Bush administration during Paul
O'Neill's tenure as Secretary of the Treasury.
Written by former Wall Street Journal reporter
Ron
Suskind, the book says
Bush's economic policies were irresponsible, Bush was unquestioning and
uncurious, and the war in Iraq was planned from the first National Security
Council meeting, soon after the administration took office.
The book was based on extensive interviews with O'Neill and numerous
documents O'Neill received during his job as Treasury Secretary.
About Paul O'Neill
He began his public service as a computer systems analyst with the Veterans
Administration, where he served from 1961 to 1966.
He joined the United
States Office of Management and Budget in 1967, and was deputy director of
OMB from 1974 to 1977. After President Gerald Ford lost the 1976 election,
O'Neill took an executive job at the International Paper Company in New York
City. He was vice president of the company from 1977 to 1985 and president
from 1985 to 1987.
In 1988, he was approached by President George H. W. Bush to be Secretary of
Defense. O'Neill declined, but recommended Dick Cheney for the position.
Bush then pursued O'Neill to chair an advisory group on education that
included Lamar Alexander, Bill Brock, and Richard Riley. Under O'Neill's
leadership, the group recommended national standards and unified testing
standards.
O'Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant Alcoa from
1987 to 1999, and retired as chairman at the end of 2000. His reign was
extremely successful, as the company's revenues increased from $1.5 billion
in 1987 to $23 billion in 2000 and O'Neill's personal fortune grew to $60
million.
In 1995, O'Neill was made chairman of the RAND Corporation.
O'Neill was appointed Secretary of the Treasury by George W. Bush. O'Neill
was a somewhat outspoken member of the administration, often saying things
to the press that went against the administration's party line, and doing
unusual things like taking a tour of Africa with singer Bono.
His book claims that the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was not a reaction to the
attacks of September 11, but was instead a campaign in the planning stages
ever since Bush took office, with potential oil spoils charted in early
documents.
Rather than denying his allegations, Bush officials attacked O'Neill's
credibility, while answering that regime change in Iraq had been official
U.S. policy since 1998, three years before Bush took office. However,
O'Neill's claims called into question the relationship of the Iraq
occupation to the post-9/11
War on Terrorism.
After documents containing classified information were shown during a 60
Minutes interview in which O'Neill promoted the book, a Department of
Treasury investigation concluded in 2004 that no laws were violated, but
that inadequate document handling policies at Treasury had allowed 140
documents, which should have been marked classified, to be entered into a
computer system for unclassified documents.
The documents were amongst those subsequently
released to O'Neill in response to a legal document request.
