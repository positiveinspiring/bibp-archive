You might ask me at this point to be specific and state if there is any significant hindrance which needs to be offset or changed, once realized. An understanding of all I have stated above will greatly help, for I have pointed out three difficulties. Add to this the realization that a right handling of the broad issues will automatically tend to take care of the details. By this I mean that the establishing of sound inner group relations between all of the workers will produce that inner cohesion and one-pointed effort which must inevitably and surely produce the outer results and attract both the needed workers and the essential money.
See to it also that one department of the work is not over-emphasized in your minds to the exclusion of others, for that will produce strain, lack of balance and sometimes [336] a sense of separation, leading if continued, to disruption. Let the consciousness be developed that there is one work being done by all, and that the whole group is concerned in the entire activity. This inclusive attitude should permeate the entire Organization, and thus the departmental spirit need not enter in.
One point I will touch upon for the clarification of your minds. The daily meditation, both personal and in relation to the group, would produce better results if the focus of attention were given to the attaining of the needed inner attitudes, the intensification of the inner spiritual life of understanding and the welding of all workers into one unity of service. A united attitude of love, of hopeful expectancy, of courage, of spiritual demand and of directed will is potent in results and will bring all that is required.
Has there not been too much attention in the past to aspects of physical plane effort, and to techniques of working? Has there not been too much consideration of how to do the work and too little consideration of the spiritual dynamics of the work itself? The need has been great and the problems many. The expansion of the work may seem necessarily to foster a departmental spirit. When such situations arise, it is necessary then to intensify the inner sense of unity. Differentiations are easy, for they follow the line of least resistance upon the physical plane. But the work is one work, and the workers constitute one group. The need now is fusion and group understanding.
Is it not true that a point of fusion achieved in the daily meditation by an individual brings about right expression in the daily life and a right handling of life conditions? A point of fusion achieved in group meditation will evoke the right results and produce an instrument of service of such power that its progress will be irresistible.
The strain of the past three years has been long and great. Many of the workers are feeling it, and the need for love and strength is great. The strain ahead will be no lighter, though it will register differently and bring different problems, but you are equal to it and to the task ahead. [337] Success can crown the efforts being made, and the new group of world servers can measure up to the need, if there is a more conscious and definite attempt to stand in the center - the place of loving power - and an increased ability to think in terms of group synthesis and fusion, and to choose with wisdom those who (from inner development and outer ability, for these must go together) belong to the group.
