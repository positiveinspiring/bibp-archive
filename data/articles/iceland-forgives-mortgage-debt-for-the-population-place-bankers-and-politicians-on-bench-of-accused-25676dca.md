This is awesome.
It shows when the people DO STAND UP they have
more power and win against the corrupt bankers and politicians of a country.
Iceland is forgiving and erasing the mortgage debt of the population. They
are putting the bankers and politicians on the "Bench of the Accused."
Which means I assume they are putting them on
trial for corruption.
Now the rest of people of the world need to start doing the same thing. We
all need to stand up and against all the corruption and fraud of the banks
and politicians that are puppets of the banks and corporations.
The government of Iceland has forgiven the mortgage debt for much of its
population.
This nation chose a very different way of
stopping the crisis from the rest of European countries. It decided to hear
the requests of the population and to put politicians and bankers on the
bench of the accused three years after their financial excesses would sank
one of the most prosperous economies in 2008.
