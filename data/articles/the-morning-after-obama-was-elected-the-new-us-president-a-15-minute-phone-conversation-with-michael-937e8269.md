Phone Conversation With Michael St.Clair

Kerry Cassidy: Here we are, this is
Kerry Cassidy and Bill Ryan from Project Camelot, and we are here with
Michael St. Clair on the morning after the United States election in
which Obama is now president.
Bill Ryan: And it is the fifth of November, 2008.
K: And we want to welcome Michael and actually talk to you,
Michael, about number one, your predictions and talk to you about
timelines, and why people's predictions and even Looking Glass, in fact,
has been wrong about telling the future, repeatedly at this point.
Michael St.Clair: Yes. You see with the alignments that we have now it
is very difficult to say what is real and what is not real, what is
actually going on and what is prediction and what is creating an event
and what is co-creation and what is action.
So, while I predicted that Mrs. Palin will be president, I will stand by
that prediction and she will be probably be preparing her run for
presidency for 2012. And, to be honest with you, Kerry, you know,
whoever is caught in the prediction of Obama being president, will now
also have a certain part in the responsibility of what is about to
unfold. And I am glad not to have any part in that, because I can say
that I did not help co-create it. And so I will not have to live with
the consequences of what this is going to bring.
Because you see, what is now happening is that there are events in
motion, where the controllers feel that they actually have this wrapped
up and that they control the events. But the astrology will tell us, the
very advanced astrologist-seers, who know now at this point that you
cannot control events, and that there are things happening around the
world, in this physical realm, that are very very unusual.
And I want to give you a very short, quick example, a very simple
example. Ill post a photo on my website,
light-seeds.com in about 24
hours. Very simply put, there is a cherry tree in the neighborhood of a
sacred place I go at times, and were in the middle of fall - its
rather cool now in Frankfurt - and this cherry tree is blossoming while
all the leaves are falling apart, and so while actually the nature is
preparing for winter, you have this lonely cherry tree which is
blossoming.
You understand what Im saying?
K: Absolutely.
M: So youre looking at an event that is totally out of the ordinary.
And thats the shamanic sign. And there are many other events, like a
couple of days ago I crossed the street and saw some street lights that
were blinking, and all of the sudden one of the lights just went dead. I
just looked at it and thought of it and thought: thats interesting. So
I think thats the stance to take, is to observe whats going on around
us and to just say its interesting. So thats where were at, you know?
K: One thing were aware of, as Camelot, is that there are obviously
factions behind the scenes that are orchestrating events, and that
Obama was chosen by one group and then there is an opposition group
that wanted McCain obviously, and therefore one group is
absolutely winning at the moment, and that could shift at any time.
One of the things that has been going on behind the scenes are a lot of
things that we are not hearing about, and therefore its very hard for
people who see events, or even intentions for events, and read them on a
psychic level, to tap into how theyre actually going to play out.
And that actually gets back to
Looking Glass, which is like an alien
device for seeing the future, that
Dan Burisch talked about. And here we
have Looking Glass having been wrong on a number of counts.
One of the things Looking Glass had said is that Hillary would be
President. Now, we know that there are lots of predictions that Obama
may not make it through to the end of office. There are all sorts of
predictions that could change the current timeline that were on again.
So, what you have is, what seems to be
awakening consciousness, around
the planet, that is actually impacting on the timelines. Therefore,
intentions of the
Powers That Be are not going to be necessarily playing
out the way that they expect them to. And so theyre scrambling behind
the scenes.
On top of that youve got
white hats in the US government, and so on
that we have been contacted in regard to, which are actually
orchestrating some events against that
Bush faction that originally was
in power. So, theres a lot of different things going on, as you know,
so maybe you want to about that, maybe you want to talk a little bit
about some of the things going on in Europe, because we have listeners
to this all over the world.
And anywhere else in the world, certainly
the Russian situation is very interesting as well.
B: And you
also mentioned, Michael, in your own words, events that were
about to unfold, and it would be very interesting for listeners to hear
what it is you have to say about that.
M: Yes, I do not want to comment on this, Bill, and Im going to now
explain to you why. I dont want to have any energy strings attached to
this, because my work is geared and focused towards creating what I
called Radiant Zones, or places of retreat where we can create new
economies, and so my friends and clients and I are very active in
creating opportunities.
For instance today I came from a meeting where we are creating green
high tech new application in the medical business. Were doing a lot of
positive things. Were active in other words, creating what were
talking about, new economies, were buying gold, were getting ready for
exciting so, you have to understand, youre going to have levels and
levels of realities, or what you call timelines, one can call them
timelines or realities, and they will coexist with each other.
So now its a matter of where we are going to put the focus. So my focus
is with my friends, and colleagues and clients around the world, where
we are creating opportunity, { K: Yes } and what goes on, on those other
levels that you talked about, Ive said to my friends and my clients, we
dont give any focus or energy to those matters, they can live with the
consequences of what they create, and we focus on really positive things
that we want to create, and these things will coexist for a while until
these timelines then separate, because as I said in the beginning, we
are living now through very unusual phenomenon-type series, like the
cherry tree, like other things I mentioned, and, that is interesting.
We have to just look at it, observe it, and, stay aloof, and detached of
it, while doing what we want to create. So we have to now actually walk
these paths of our intentions of what we want to call spirituality,
etcetera, and when looking at the astrological alignments, we know that
were going through two or three or four years now, where there is
obviously polarization and tension going on, but that is creative
tension out of which, beautiful results will emerge.
K: Okay. Well, obviously, were right on board with you, Michael, in
that regard, and youre aware of our
Project Avalon { M: Yes } and the
Ground Crew, which we have gathered, and are gathering as we speak to
put together safe zones where they can live, create projects where they
do something creative, and feel good about the future, and begin to
create the future as we go.
And thank God for the awakening consciousness around the planet in this
regard, part of that is certainly creating the success that Project
Avalon, and
our forum, has been already. But we are also looking towards
the future here, and we are calling you to find out if you have anything
to say in regard to the astrology of the future, and I know you sent
through a link, and you have some things posted on your site about the
various planetary alignments and so on that are going to be coming.
And maybe you can address some of that, for our listeners at the moment.
Were not going to having a very long phone call here, but we would like
it if you could cover some of that astrology for people.
M: Yes, well the trends are now that were moving into beautiful
alignments, for instance, right in the beginning of the year, with the
Aquarian conjunction of Jupiter and Neptune and Chiron, lasting to
May-June 2009, the full moon of June 2009, and then towards the end of
the year.
So the whole of 2009, is creating networks, the key word here is
creating networks, thats the idea behind the Radiant Zones: to create
networks of people who help each other in creating new economies, and
new technology and solutions, and of course in the economy were faced
with a situation where, like I told you in May of this year, we have to
buy gold, and thats what we are doing.
And thats what friends and clients are doing, and what people should be
doing, is just make sure they stay independent of what is going to
happen, economically speaking to the paper money. And I know that what
were doing, is a lasting experiment and will create, really solutions.
What I can say is that the solutions are going to have to come about by
people who focus on doing that and nothing else. So this is a complete
change in direction of thinking that we have to go through. Now thats
what the astrology shows, we have to now rethink everything that we
thought we knew about reality and how reality stacks up.
Thats what the main alignment is all about, with this opposition
between Uranus and Saturn is actual reality is in question now. And this
alignment lasts more or less for about two years. So this is a very long
story thats twenty-four months of living through these creative
tensions I mentioned and oppositions and squares leading to July of
2010, but all of this is accompanied by extremely beautiful
opportunities and chances, so now is the time to be really awake.
K: Okay, and youve watched the economies actually going down, and I
know youre stressing buying gold. There are a lot of people out there
that dont necessarily have the wherewithal to buy gold, however,
certainly bartering may come to pass, as a means of getting by, in the
coming days, as we see a greater economic downturn. Are you seeing the
economies actually going by the wayside, at the moment?
M: Yes, well I see both, there are opportunities coming along now, where
a lot is possible, where you can create your own economies, so Im not
at all for getting by, that concept is, like, foreign to my friends and
myself.
We dont want to get by, we want to create a very interesting
commonwealth among people who are connected in networks. And how we do
this depends on what is around us, so yes, sure you see the economy
going down in the sense that the whole paper money, and the whole
exchanges and the markets, etcetera, are out for the count, for the
moment, and I would assume that probably within a year or two
the
Federal Reserve will be dissolved, and that, this whole reality that we
lived until now is in question.
So now is time, of course to wake up and create something of your own.
And the barter system is a great part of it, absolutely. You can trade
your services against goods, etcetera, so this is all going to become a
whole new concept that comes into being in the next two to four years.
It has begun, actually it is a reality now.
K: Yes, I think its, thats possible around the world.
M: I just want to say that I dont see any of this in a negative light.
K: I understand. Do you have anything else that you wanted to add this
morning while we have you on the line?
M: Yes, sure, I would like to say that right now, as the weeks unfold,
and the months, all of these trends and events will be dominated by
powerful planetary releases, and some of it can be very healing, some of
it can be stressful, depending on where you stand, how you look at it,
and this is why Im saying that the best we can do now is to be really
fluid and stay in observing mode and not attached to the outside events
and to what is happening to these larger political economic trends, and
instead focus on our own lives and our friends and our networks, and
create together, opportunities and work on that.
And put all our effort and energy into this, and this will go very well
because the astrology would show that now is a very good time to get
started with it. Im extremely positive, I mean I can say to you that my
clients and my friends, we are very happy about this and we are going
about doing our things.
I been doing it now for awhile { K: Yes } so to us, we carry on. Its
looking good. Here in Europe, things are okay, and my friends in the
United States and in Canada, all over the world, were connected to
create what we want to do for each one.
So, were looking at all of this from a completely different viewpoint,
this is another perspective, and I think the cherry tree I was telling
you about, sums it up, we are going to live through very unusual
phenomenon. We will see things, that on the face of it dont make sense,
and so we will have the layers of reality, and we will be looking at
that, and observing it, and thinking about it a little bit, what this
can mean in our lives. So this is, I think this is exciting.
K: Right. Well, we definitely would agree with you there.
(mutual laughter)
K: At any rate, thank you very much, Michael St.Clair, for spending a
little time with us this morning, and just giving us your take on
current events and what may be coming in the future here. So, Im going
to let you go, because we are getting another call, and take care, okay?
M: Okay, thank you so much, all the best to you, you be well, okay?
