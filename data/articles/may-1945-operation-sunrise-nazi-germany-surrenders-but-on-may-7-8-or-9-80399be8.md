After the Casablanca
Conference of January 1943, the Americans, British, and
Soviets had agreed that there would be no separate
negotiations with Nazi Germany with respect to its
capitulation, and that the Germander surrender would
have to be unconditional.
In the early spring of
1945, Germany was as good as defeated and the Allies
were getting ready to receive its capitulation.
The expected
unconditional German capitulation vis-à-vis all three
Allies would have to be concluded somewhere, but where -
on the Eastern Front, or on the Western Front?
If only for reasons of
prestige, the Western Allies preferred that this would happen on the Western
Front.
Secret talks with the
Germans, which the British and Americans were holding at that time (i.e. in
March 1945) in neutral Switzerland, code-named
Operation Sunrise, were useful in that
context, not only with an eye on a German surrender in Italy, which had
actually led to the talks, but also in view of the coming general and
supposedly unconditional German capitulation, of which intriguing details -
such as the venue of the ceremony - might possibly be determined in advance
and without input from the the Soviets.
There were many possibilities
in this respect, because the Germans themselves kept approaching the
Americans and the British in the hope of concluding a separate armistice
with the Western powers or, if that would prove impossible, of steering as
many Wehrmacht units as possible into American or British captivity by means
of individual or local surrenders, i.e. surrenders of larger or smaller
units of the German army in restricted areas of the front.
The Great War of 1914-1918
had ended with a clear and unequivocal armistice, namely in the form of an
unconditional German surrender, which everybody knows went into effect on
the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918.
The Second World War, on the
other hand, was to grind to a halt, in Europe at least, amidst intrigue and
confusion, so that even today there are many misconceptions regarding the
time and place of the German capitulation. The Second World War was to end
in the European theatre not with one, but with an entire string of German
capitulations, with a veritable orgy of surrenders.
It started in Italy on April
29, 1945, with the capitulation of the combined German armies in
southwestern Europe to the Allied forces led by Alexander, the British field
marshal.
Signatories on the German
side included SS General Karl Wolff, who had conducted the
negotiations with American secret agents in Switzerland about sensitive
issues such as the neutralization of the kind of Italian anti-fascists for
whom there was no room in the American-British post-war plans for their
country.
Stalin had expressed
misgivings about the arrangement that was being worked out between the
Western Allies and the Germans in Italy, but in the end he gave his blessing
to this capitulation after all.
Many people in Great Britain
firmly believe even today that the war against Germany ended with a German
surrender in the headquarters of another British field marshal, namely
Montgomery, on the Luneburg Heath in northern Germany.
Yet this ceremony took place
on May 4, 1945, that is, at least five days before the guns finally fell
silent in Europe, and this capitulation applied only to German troops that
had hitherto been battling Montgomerys British-Canadian 21st
Army Group in the Netherlands and in Northwest Germany.
Just to be on the safe side,
the Canadians actually accepted the capitulation of all German troops in
Holland the next day, May 5, during a ceremony in the town of Wageningen, a
town in the eastern Dutch province of Gelderland.[1]
In America and also in
Western Europe the event on the Luneburg Heath is rightly viewed as a
strictly local capitulation, even though it is recognized that it served as
a kind of prelude to the definitive German capitulation and resulting
ceasefire.
As far as the Americans,
French, Belgians, and others are concerned, this definitive German surrender
took place in the headquarters of General Eisenhower, the supreme
commander of all Allied forces on the Western Front, in a shabby school
building in the city of Reims on May 7, 1945, in the early morning.
But this armistice was to go
into effect only on the next day, May 8, and only at 11:01 p.m. It is for
this reason that even now, commemoration ceremonies in the United States and
in Western Europe take place on May 8.
However, even the important
event in Reims was not the final surrender ceremony.
With the permission of
Hitlers successor,
Admiral Dönitz, German spokesmen had
come knocking on Eisenhowers door in order to try once again to conclude an
armistice only with the Western Allies or, failing that, to try to rescue
more Wehrmacht units from the clutches of the Soviets by means of local
surrenders on the Western Front.
Eisenhower was personally no
longer willing to consent to further local surrenders, let alone a general
German capitulation to the Western Allies only.
But he appreciated the
potential advantages that would accrue to the Western side if somehow the
bulk of the Wehrmacht would end up in British-American rather than Soviet
captivity.
And he also realized that
this was a unique opportunity to induce the desperate Germans to sign in his
headquarters the general and unconditional capitulation in the form of a
document that would conform to inter-Allied agreements; this detail would
obviously do much to enhance the prestige of the United States.
In Reims it thus came to a
byzantine scenario.
First, from Paris an obscure
Soviet liaison officer, Major General Ivan Susloparov, was brought
over in order to save the appearance of the required Allied collegiality.
Second, while it was made
clear to the Germans that there could be no question of a separate
capitulation on the Western Front, a concession was made to them in the form
of an agreement that the armistice would only go into effect after a delay
of forty-five hours. This was done to accommodate the new German leaders
desire to give as many Wehrmacht units as possible a last chance to
surrender to the Americans or the British.
This interval gave the
Germans the opportunity to transfer troops from the East, where heavy
fighting continued unabatedly, to the West, where after the signing rituals
in Luneburg and then Reims hardly any shots were being fired anymore.
The Germans, whose delegation
was headed by General Jodl, signed the capitulation document at
Eisenhowers headquarters on May 7 at 2:41 a.m.; but as mentioned earlier,
the guns were to fall silent only on May 8 at 11:01 p.m.
Local American commanders
would cease to allow fleeing Germans to escape behind their lines only after
the German capitulation actually went into effect.
It can be argued, then, that
the deal concluded in the Champagne city did not constitute a totally
unconditional capitulation.[2]
The document signed in Reims
(image above) gave the Americans precisely what they wanted, namely, the
prestige of a general German surrender on the Western Front in Eisenhowers
headquarters.
The Germans also achieved the
best they could hope for, since their dream of a capitulation to the Western
Allies alone appeared to be out of the question:
a postponement of
execution, so to speak, of almost two days.
During this time, the
fighting continued virtually only on the Eastern Front, and countless German
soldiers took advantage of this opportunity to disappear behind the
British-American lines.[3]
However, the text of the
surrender in Reims did not conform entirely to the wording of a general
German capitulation agreed upon previously by the Americans and the British
as well as the Soviets. It was also questionable whether the representative
of the USSR, Susloparov, was really qualified to co-sign the document.
Furthermore, it is
understandable that the Soviets were far from pleased that the Germans were
afforded the possibility to continue to battle the Red Army for almost two
more days while on the Western Front the fighting had virtually come to an
end.
The impression was thus
created that what had been signed in Reims was in fact a German surrender on
the Western Front only, an arrangement that violated the inter-Allied
agreements.
In order to clear the air, it
was decided to organize an ultimate capitulation ceremony, so that the
German surrender in Reims retroactively revealed itself as a sort of prelude
to the final surrender and/or as a purely military surrender, even though
the Americans and the Western Europeans would continue to commemorate it as
the true end to the war in Europe.[4]
General Keitel signs
Germanys unconditional
surrender in Berlin (right)
It was in Berlin, in the
headquarters of Marshal Zhukov, that the final and general, political
as well as military, German capitulation was signed on May 8, 1945 or, put
differently, that the German capitulation of the day before in Reims was
properly ratified by all the Allies.
The signatories for Germany,
acting on the instructions of Admiral Dönitz, were the generals Keitel,
von Friedeburg (who had also been present in Reims) and Stumpf.
Since Zhukov had a lower
military rank than Eisenhower, the latter had a perfect excuse for not
attending the ceremony in the rubble of the German capital.
He sent his rather
low-profile British deputy, Marshal Tedder, to sign, and this of
course took some luster away from the ceremony in Berlin in favor of the one
in Reims.[5]
As far as the Soviets and the
majority of Eastern Europeans were concerned, the Second World War in Europe
ended with the ceremony in Berlin on May 8, 1945, which resulted in the arms
being laid down the next day, on May 9.
For the Americans, and for
most Western Europeans, the real thing was and remains the surrender in
Reims, signed on May 7 and effective on May 8. While the former always
commemorate the end of the war on May 9, the latter invariably do so on May
8. (But the Dutch celebrate on May 5.)
That one of the greatest
dramas of world history could have such a confusing and unworthy end in
Europe was a consequence, as Gabriel Kolko writes, of the way in
which the Americans and the British sought to achieve all sorts of big and
small advantages for themselves - to the disadvantage of the Soviets - from
the inevitable German capitulation.[6]
The First World War had ended
de facto with the armistice of November 11, 1918, and de jure with the
signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919.
The Second World War came to
an end with an entire string of surrenders, but it never did come to a peace
treaty à la versaillaise, at least not with respect to Germany.
(Peace treaties were in due course concluded with Japan, Italy, and so on.)
The reason for this is that
the victors - the Western Allies on the one side and the Soviets on the
other side - were unable to come to an agreement about Germanys fate.
Consequently, a few years
after the war two German states emerged, which virtually precluded the
possibility of a peace treaty reflecting an agreement acceptable to all
parties involved.
And so a peace treaty with
Germany, that is, a final settlement of all issues that remained unresolved
after the war, such as the question of Germanys eastern border, became
feasible only when the reunification of the two Germanys became a realistic
proposition, namely, after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
That made the Two-plus-Four
negotiations of the summer and fall of 1990 possible, negotiations whereby
on the one hand the two German states found ways to reunify Germany, and
whereby on the other hand the four great victors of the Second World War -
the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union - imposed
their conditions on the German reunification and cleared up the status of
the newly reunited country, taking into account not only their own interests
but also the interests of other concerned European states such as Poland.
The result of these
negotiations was a convention that was signed in Moscow on September 12,
1990, and which, faute de mieux, can be viewed as the peace treaty
that put an official end to the Second World War, at least with respect to
Germany.[7]
