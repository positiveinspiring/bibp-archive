Global food security may be in peril unless
immediate measures are taken to stem the dramatic loss of genetic diversity
among food crops and their wild relatives, according to a report by
the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
It is largely the genetic diversity found in both cultivated and wild
varieties of food crops that allows farmers and scientists to create new
strains.
In the face of a changing climate, the ability
to develop crops that can resist drought, heat, salinity, disease and pests
will only become more important. Yet according to the report, 75 percent of
crop diversity has already been lost since 1900, as agribusiness focused on
increasing the output of a few big cash crops and rare local varieties
disappeared.
Habitat destruction has wiped out wild relatives
of food crops, and global warming is exacerbating those effects. By 2050,
the report predicts, 22 percent of wild bean, peanut and potato relatives
will be lost to climate change.
Brian O'Leary describes the situation in his book
Reinheriting the Earth:
"It is as if humankind is painting a picture
of the next millennium with a shrinking palette - the world will still
be colored green, but in increasingly uniform and monocultured tones.
One in eight species are immediately threatened.
To make matters more
challenging, the genetic diversity of food supply keeps decreasing.
For
the sake of improving agricultural efficiency, large centralized seed
providers narrow the choices for farmers and raise the risk of major
crops being wiped out by blights or bad weather."
The FAO report calls for an immediate effort to
collect and study the remaining wild crop relatives and rare cultivars.
"The loss of biodiversity will have a major
impact on the ability of humankind to feed itself in the future; all
nine billion of us by 2050, with the poorest in the world most
affected," the report warns.
