Released September 8th; a video from the families who fought to create
The
9/11 Commission - and succeeded Headline: LA Weekly reported Mahmmud Ahmed
(Top ISI Official) ordered the transfer of funds from Pakistani banks to
Florida, where it was picked up and distributed by Mohammed Atta to the 9/11
hijackers via money orders throughout the United States to sponsor the
attacks.
This documentary presents the many-faceted
events that led up to, and then scrutinizes, the 9/11 Commission hearings.
Massive injustices and mis-representations are brought to light and
"exposed" by respected members of the mainstream American media, and from
the families themselves in the narrative of events that shaped most greatly
our world today:
"9/11 - Press for Truth"
The families present their 2Â½ year struggle
to create an investigation and inquiry into the events of 9/11 - which was
at first heavily resisted and even explicitly prohibited by the President
and Vice-President.
For an example of contrast in funding: the internal
disruption of a Clinton-Lewinski "sex scandal" the event was awarded a
budget of 100 million dollars in total.
Initially the 9/11 Commission was only allotted
3 million dollars and their time-limit was severely cut beyond the
expectations of those who brought it into existence.
