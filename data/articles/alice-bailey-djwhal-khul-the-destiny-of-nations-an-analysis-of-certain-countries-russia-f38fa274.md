The Destiny of the Nations - An Analysis of Certain Countries
I can only most briefly touch upon the energies which motivate and condition the Italian empire and the United States, leaving you to make your deductions and applications.
Russia
is as yet embryonic and her part lies more in the East than in the West, provided she follows the indicated lines. Her two ruling signs are Aquarius and Leo and her real function in the comity of nations lies far ahead when [86] the Aquarian age is flourishing and the Leo control of the Russian personality has been offset. The planets which primarily influence Russia are the Sun (2nd ray), Uranus (7th ray), Jupiter (2nd ray) and the Moon (4th ray). This makes a most interesting, a most humanitarian and - in the long run - a non-destructive combination. At present, the intensely individualistic Leo force in its worst aspects are dominating, but this will not last as history will eventually prove. The noisy, cruel child can turn into a controlled humanitarian in adult life and the influences potent in the Russian horoscope indicate this.
