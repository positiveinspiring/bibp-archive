Many civilizations with flying saucers exist, and are hidden inside this planet. Beings which generate out of their own thought, various craft which are among us. There are also the UFO craft that are built by surface cultures.
All these are linked together in various ways. Most all of these are OCCULT (hidden)... and most are messengers of deception.
In 1867, Wentworth Little founded the English Rosicrucian Society. He was in contact with the German Rosicrucians. Little recruited his followers, up to 144 people, from the ranks of the higher-ranking Freemasons.
One of his disciples was Bulwer Lytton, who was a learned man celebrated throughout the world for his novel The Last Days of Pompeii. He also wrote The Coming Race which featured a mystical pre-Nazi group in Germany.
This Berlin group called itself the Luminous Lodge, or Vril Society Vril (like the force) has enormous energy potential. The book describes a race of men physically far in advance of surface humans. They have acquired powers over themselves and over all material objects.
They lived in caves and would emerge to reign over the surface world. The most prominent member of the Vril Society was Karl Haushofer, a close confidant of Hitler, Hess and Rosenburg, who all belonged to the Thule Society (Thule Gesellschaft) that was founded in Munich in 1918.
Thule was a neo-Gnostic racist group, which became a rallying front for the societal roots of Nazi thought. The chief architect of the Thule group was Baron Rudolf von Sebottendorff (Rudolf Glauer) who had direct contact with the Dervish Orders and knew a great deal about Islamic mysticism, particularly Sufism in all its aspects. He also had contact with Herman Pohl, leader of the German Order Walvater of the Holy Grail.
Nazi occultism was a mixture of influences and a host of interrelated secret societies, including the Bavarian Illuminati, the Knights Templar, the Teutonic Knights, the Holy Vehm, the Golden Dawn, the Rosy-Cross, the Vril Society, the German Order and its offshoot, the Thule Society.
Thule is known as the capital of Hyperborea, in the polar regions.
Also known as Ultima Thule, it was the gateway to other worlds.
It was known to serve as both a place to leave the earth and a place on the rim of the opening to the hollow earth. It is interesting to note that the major powers of the earth have microwave stations setup in the area, broadcasting ELF waves on brain-wave frequencies.
Tradition has it that Hyperboreans were in contact with various alien cultures. War supposedly broke out between the Hyperboreans and other civilizations (atomic war).
Descendants of the Thule caste (Celts) emigrated elsewhere to other areas of the planet. They colonized these areas, driven by memory chromosomes inherited from their space-travelling ancestors.
These star seed people are mostly of Celtic origin (Basques, Irish, English, Norsemen, Icelanders, Bretons, Spaniards and Portuguese) which, strangely enough, make up the largest percentage of RH-NEGATIVE blood types.
Current neo-Nazis are allegedly trying to locate and control these people. Apparently, most contactees have RH-blood type. Are UFO cultures tracking their own cross-breeds?
The Grand Lodge of Vril was seeking to re-unite the ancient Aryan traditions and to make contact with the original super-human luminous race and to make an alliance with beings who have secret sanctuaries hidden inside the planet.
The book UFOs - NAZI SECRET WEAPON? by Mattern-Friedrich brings out some interesting information, It seems that Victor Schauberger (1885-1958) invented a number of flying disks for the Nazis between 1938 and 1945. Vangard Notes...
We have seen a copy of a letter from Schauberger to a friend which states that he worked at Matthausen concentration camp directing technically oriented prisoners and other German scientists in the successful construction of a saucer.
In this letter written by Schauberger, he gives further information from his direct experience with the German military:
The flying saucer which was flight-tested on the 19th February 1945 near Prague and which attained a height of 15,000 meters in 3 minutes and a horizontal speed of 2,200 km/hours, was constructed according to a Mod l 1 built at Mauthausen concentration camp in collaboration with the first-class engineers and stress-analysts ASSIGNED TO ME from the prisoners there. It was only after the end of the war that I came to hear, through one of the workers UNDER MY DIRECTION, a Czech, THAT FURTHER INTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT WAS IN PROGRESS. However, there was no answer to my enquiry. From what I understand, just before the end of the war, the machine is SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DESTROYED on Keitels orders. Thats the last I heard of it. In this affair, several armament specialists were also involved who appeared at the works in Prague, shortly before my return to Vienna, and asked that I DEMONSTRATE the fundamental basis of it: The CREATION OF AN ATOMIC LOW-PRESSURE ZONE, which DEVELOPS IN SECONDS when either AIR or WATER IS CAUSED TO MOVE RADIALLY AND AXIALLY under conditions of a FALLING TEMPERATURE GRADIENT."

Schauberger and his son lived in the United States for a short time after the war, where he was reported to be working on a top secret UFO project in Texas for the US Government.
Reports of Aryan looking saucer pilots are many. Long haired blond folks that speak German. It is interesting to note that the so-called venusian saucer design of contactees all look like German saucer designs. The Thule Society is still alive in the minds of neo-Nazi (Fourth Reich) occultists.
There is a booklet going around that reports to be the secret log of Admiral Richard Byrd. In 1978, copies were sent out by the Hollow Earth Research Society in Ontario, Canada.
Ivan Boyes, its director, claims that after the war, the allies discovered that over 2,000 scientists from Germany and Italy had vanished along with almost a million people to the Land beyond the pole."
This is apparently what Admiral Byrds expedition was all about. To hunt them down. The domain of the Arianni. The Flugelrads (wingwheels) were noted in the secret log as being sent to the surface world to investigate the first nuclear explosions. These were the model Ts of the German saucer design.
Do we have a myth in the making? So... Admiral Byrd goes back and tells the Pentagon and the President what he has seen. They order him to be silent.
It seems that the inner earth cavern civilizations and the lands inside the earth have been a part of the occult/military secret for a long time.
