Biography
Lee H. Hamilton became Director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in January, 1999. The Woodrow Wilson Center, located in the heart of Washington D.C., is a pre-eminent intellectual haven where scholars, policymakers, and business leaders investigate and discuss, in a comprehensive and non- partisan manner, public policy issues, their deep historical backgrounds, and their effect on our world. The Center serves as the living memorial to former President Woodrow Wilson, a scholar and a professor who was committed to bringing the world of policy and the world of ideas together so that each will learn from the other.
Prior to becoming the Director of the Woodrow Wilson Center, Lee Hamilton served for thirty-four years as a United States Congressman from Indiana. Born in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1931, Mr. Hamilton and his family soon relocated to Tennessee and then Indiana. After graduating from Central High School in Evansville, Indiana, he attended DePauw University where he studied history. He was involved in student government and served on the school’s Council on Religious Life and the Methodist Student Movement. He graduated with honors in 1952 and was awarded the Walker Cup, an award given to the most outstanding member of the senior class. Mr. Hamilton was the star of his basketball teams in high school and college, and his talent earned him a spot in the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. After college, Lee Hamilton attended Goethe University in Germany for a year, followed by law school at Indiana University, graduating in 1956. He then practiced law, first in Chicago and then in Columbus, Indiana. He was first elected to Congress from Indiana’s 9th District in 1964.
During his thirty-four year tenure in Congress, Mr. Hamilton became very influential in the area of foreign affairs. He served as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, now the Committee on International Relations, for his entire time in Congress. He became a subcommittee chairman in 1971, and chaired a Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East from the early 1970s until 1993. Lee Hamilton served for ten years as the Ranking Democrat on the Committee, and was Chairman of the Committee during the 103rd Congress. During his years in Congress, he made significant contributions to American foreign policy and took a particular interest in promoting democracy and market reform in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, as well as promoting peace and stability in the Middle East. He also encouraged the expansion of US markets overseas and the overhaul of US foreign aid and export policies. His service as a ranking member and a Chairman enabled him to become an astute observer of many significant historical events, such as the Arab/Israeli peace negotiations, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the 1991 Gulf War.
In addition to foreign affairs, Lee Hamilton made significant contributions to economic policy. As Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, he worked to create a sound and healthy economy and to promote economic development by focusing on such issues as global market competition, Federal Reserve policy, and long-term economic challenges facing the nation. Other committees Mr. Hamilton has chaired include the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, and the Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran. He was also active in strengthening Congressional ethics standards, serving on the House Standards of Official Conduct Committee and being a primary draftsman of several House ethics reforms.
In his own state of Indiana, Lee Hamilton has worked hard to improve the education, job training, and infrastructure programs of its citizens. He is now Director of a Center on Congress project at Indiana University. The Indiana Center aims to educate citizens on the way the US Congress operates, its importance, and its role in our system of government. The Center is strictly non-partisan and includes a special outreach program to the people of Indiana.
Mr. Hamilton’s distinguished service in government has been honored through numerous awards in public service and human rights. These include the Knight Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1999, the Paul H. Nitze Award for Distinguished Authority on National Security Affairs in 1999, the American Political Science Association Hubert H. Humphrey Award in 1998, the American Bar Association CEELI Award in 1998, the Center for Civic Education Civitas Award in 1998, the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 1998, the Center for National Policy Edmund S. Muskie Distinguished Public Service Award in 1997, the American Political Science Association Outstanding Legislator Award in 1997, the Indiana University Presidents Medal for Excellence in 1996, and the Indiana University Institute for Advanced Study Distinguished Citizen Fellow in 1994.

In favour of a post 9-11 draft: “President Bush has said that
the new war against terrorism will be "a different kind of conflict." He's more
right than he knows. Not only are we facing a uniquely shadowy enemy, one
committed to inflicting mass civilian casualties on U.S. soil, but for the first
time in our history we're entering a war of significant size and probable
duration without drafting young men to fight the threat.
This will have to change.America needs a draft. But because this is a new kind of war, we need a new kind of draft: One that would focus less on preparing men for conventional combat -- which hasn't been very extensive in this war so far -- than on training young men and even young women for the arguably more daunting task of guarding against and responding to terrorism at home.” – Washington Post, November 4th 2001 (with Paul Glastris)
