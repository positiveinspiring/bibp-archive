A laboratory shows how an e-voting machine
used by a third of all voters
can be easily manipulated
It could be one of the most disturbing
e-voting machine hacks to date.
Voting machines used by as many as a quarter
of American voters heading to the polls in 2012 can be hacked with just
$10.50 in parts and an 8th grade science education, according to
computer science and security experts at the
Vulnerability
Assessment Team at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois.
The experts say the newly developed hack
could change voting results while leaving absolutely no trace of the
manipulation behind.
We believe these man-in-the-middle
attacks are potentially possible on a wide variety of electronic
voting machines, said Roger Johnston, leader of the assessment team
We think we can do similar things on pretty much every electronic
voting machine.
The Argonne Lab, run by the Department of
Energy, has the mission of conducting scientific research to meet
national needs.
The
Diebold Accuvote voting system used in
the study was loaned to the labs scientists by
VelvetRevolution.us, of which
the Brad Blog is a co-founder.
Velvet
Revolution received the machine from a former Diebold contractor.
Previous lab demonstrations of e-voting
system hacks, such as Princetons demonstration of a viral cyber attack
on a Diebold touch-screen system - as
I wrote for Salon back in 2006 - relied on cyber attacks to change
the results of elections.
Such attacks, according to the team at
Argonne, require more coding skills and knowledge of the voting system
software than is needed for the attack on the Diebold system.
Indeed, the Argonne teams attack required
no modification, reprogramming, or even knowledge, of the voting
machines proprietary source code. It was carried out by inserting a
piece of inexpensive alien electronics into the machine.
The Argonne teams demonstration of the
attack on a Diebold Accuvote machine is seen in a short new video shared
exclusively with the Brad Blog [posted below].
The team successfully demonstrated a similar
attack on a touch-screen
system made by
Sequoia Voting Systems in 2009.
