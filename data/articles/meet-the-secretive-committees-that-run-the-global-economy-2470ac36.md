# Meet the Secretive Committees that Run the Global Economy

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_bisimfwb09.htm

There exists an overlapping and highly integrated network of
institutions, committees and secret meetings of ad-hoc groups
that collectively run the global economy.
This network consists
of,
...and the various conferences and confabs that bring
them together. This network is responsible for facilitating
global financial diplomacy and managing the architecture of
global financial governance.
In short: it is the most powerful
and informal political structure in the world.
With the United
States at the center of the system, the Treasury Department and
Federal Reserve Bank are the two most important American
institutions in global financial governance - and the Treasury
Secretary and Federal Reserve Chairperson are the world's two
most powerful financial diplomats.
Both institutions are
headquartered in Washington, D.C., just down the street from the
headquarters of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World
Bank Group, two global financial bodies created in 1944 to
manage the world economy on behalf of the rich Western nations
that founded them.
Twice a year, the IMF and the World Bank host large
international conferences.
The Spring Membership Meeting,
typically held in April, and the Annual membership meeting draw
a crowd consisting of most of the finance ministers and central
bank governors from the IMF's 188 member nations, representing
the Fund's Governing Board.
They descend on D.C. where the
meetings are typically held (though occasionally they are hosted
in other countries as well), and draw scores of journalists,
academics and thousands of bankers and financiers who are eager
to meet, greet, wine, dine and make deals with the political
decision-makers of the global economy.
The top five shareholders of the IMF,
-
United States
-
Japan
-
Germany
-
France
-
U.K.,
...reflect the membership of an ad-hoc
group of finance ministers that began meeting in 1973,
thereafter known as the Group of Five (G-5).
At the time, U.S.
Treasury Secretary George Shultz described
the group as,
"a channel for informal and very
frank communication on monetary and other issues, both of a
long-term and more immediate character."
But the G-5 was hardly the first
of such groups.
In 1962, the Group of Ten (G-10) was formed as a meeting of
finance ministers and central bank governors from the rich
industrial nations, including,
-
the U.S.
-
West Germany
-
Japan
-
France
-
U.K.
-
Italy
-
Canada
-
Belgium
-
Sweden
-
Netherlands (and
eventually Switzerland, although the
name remained the same)
The G-10 would
meet alongside the leaders of,
Following the U.S. unilateral decision to end the
Bretton
Woods monetary system in 1971, a series of committees and groups
were established to provide forums for major economies of the
world to negotiate forming a new monetary system, and to
integrate developing economies into the institutional apparatus
of global financial governance.
The Group of Ten was utilized as
one such forum.
In 1972, the G-10 laid the groundwork for the establishment
of a special Committee of 20 to be formed within the IMF, whose
membership reflected the composition of the IMF Executive Board,
but at the ministerial level - giving it a much higher level of
political authority than the board, which is
composed of mid-level officials from their respective
national finance ministries.
The committee would include most
G-10 members alongside several developing country
representatives, and was formally institutionalized in
late 1974 as the "Interim Committee" of the IMF.
(Although the Group of Five was formed in 1973, it wasn't
until 1975 that it held the first meeting at the head of state
level, with the addition of Italy to the group. The following
year, Canada was invited to participate, and thereafter it was
known as the Group of Seven - G-7 - effectively functioning as
the steering committee for the global economy.)
Fast forward to the mid-1990s, when the G-7 nations instructed the
Group of Ten to consult with emerging market economies on ways
to reform the global financial architecture in cooperation with
major international organizations like the IMF, World Bank,
OECD, and BIS, which were increasingly opening their membership
and ownership positions to large emerging market economies.
The idea was thus:
If developed countries give developing
countries a stake in the existing system, they won't use their
new-found wealth and power to oppose that system.
And all the
while, the West was to remain at the center.
Through crisis and
collapse and "rescue" efforts led by the IMF, BIS and World
Bank, developing and emerging market economies were encouraged
to accept Western economic "advice" on how to manage their
economies.
If they wanted bailouts in the form of loans from
international institutions, those countries had to follow
conditions that demanded a total restructuring of their
economies and societies along G-7 lines - designed to transform
them into modern "market economies" capable of integrating into
the larger global economy.
The groundwork was laid out over the following years, and in
the course of 1999, the IMF's Interim Committee was reformed
into the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC).
The G-10 organized several seminars involving major emerging
market economies and, together with the G-7, formed a new group
known as the Financial
Stability Forum (FSF), a meeting group of central bankers,
finance ministers and regulators who were handed responsibility
for maintaining financial stability in the world. Finally, 1999
also saw the organizing efforts of the G-7 result in the
formation of yet another forum, the Group of Twenty (G-20).
The G-20 was born in December of 1999 at a meeting of finance
ministers and central bank governors from the G-7 nations, along
with,
-
Russia
-
China
-
India
-
Brazil
-
Indonesia
-
Korea
-
Australia
-
Mexico
-
Saudi Arabia
-
South Africa
-
Turkey
-
Argentina
-
the
European Union
The event was
attended by top officials from the IMF, World Bank and the
European Central Bank.
But despite all the international noise,
the G20 was largely
the initiative of two men:
The G-7, or G-8 once Russia was invited in, remained the main
forum for global economic leadership.
But in the midst of the
global financial crisis in 2008, the G-20 was the group convened
by U.S. President
George W. Bush, who brought together heads of
state for the first meeting that took place in Washington on
November 15.
That meeting produced
an agreement among G-20 nations to pump trillions of dollars
into their economies in order to bail out their banking systems.
In 2010, then-President of the European Central Bank,
Jean-Claude Trichet, explained at
a meeting of the Institute of International Finance (IIF) that
the G-20 had emerged,
"as the prime group for global
economic governance."
Speaking to a crowd of hundreds of the world's most powerful
bankers and financiers, Trichet explained,
"Global economic governance
embraces supranational institutions - such as the IMF - as
well as informal groupings - such as the G-7 and the G-20.
Both are necessary, and both are complementary."
Trichet praised
the evolving system as,
"moving decisively towards a
much more inclusive system of global governance,
encompassing key emerging economies as well as the
industrialized countries."
To this day, the hierarchy of global economic governance
follows a familiar pattern.
Take the IMF's meetings, where 188
of the world's finance ministers and central bankers meet. The
International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) holds a
meeting, functioning as the steering committee to the Fund. And
prior to IMFC meetings, the G-20 finance ministers and central
bank governors hold a series of meetings, including a joint
meeting with the IMFC, as they already have a significant
crossover of membership.
But before the G-20 meets, the ministers and governors of the
G-7 nations typically meet privately for an hour or so,
attempting to form a common position or strategy in dealing with
the wider groupings of the G-20 and IMFC, in which all G-7
nations are represented at the ministerial level.
The chiefs of
the world's major international organizations (IMF, World Bank,
OECD, WTO, BIS) participate in almost all of these meetings,
acting as advisers to and receiving high-level political
direction from these groups.
The hierarchy of global economic governance emanates out of
the United States, in close cooperation with Germany, Japan and
the other members of the Group of Seven.
From there, it networks
through the Group of Twenty and the IMFC, which in turn
collectively function as the steering committee for the world's
major international organizations, and act as the board of
directors of the global economy.
