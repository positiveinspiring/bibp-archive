Yes, the infamous
Trilateral Commission still exists.
Many people think the TC, created in 1973 by David Rockefeller, is a
relic of an older time.
Think again...
Patrick Wood, author of
Trilaterals Over Washington, points out there are only 87 members
of the Trilateral Commission who live in America. Obama appointed eleven of
them to posts in his administration.
Keep in mind that the original stated goal of the TC was to create "a new
international economic order."
Knowing that you have to break eggs to make an
omelette, consider how the following TC members, in key Obama posts, can
help engender further national chaos; erase our sovereign national borders,
and install binding international agreements that will envelop our economy
and money in a deeper global collective: a new world order:
-
Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary
-
James Jones, National Security Advisor
-
Paul Volker, Chairman, Economic Recovery
Committee
-
Dennis Blair, Director of National
Intelligence
All Trilateralists...
In the run-up to his inauguration after the 2008 presidential election,
Obama was tutored by the co-founder of the Trilateral Commission,
Zbigniew Brzezinski.
In Europe, the financially embattled nations of Greece and Italy brought in
Lucas Papademos and Mario Monti as prime ministers. Both men are Trilateral
members, and Monti is the former European chairman of the Trilateral
Commission.
In the US, since 1973, author Wood counts eight out of 10 US Trade
Representative appointments, and six out of eight World Bank presidencies,
as American Trilateral members.
Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote, four years before birthing the TC with his
godfather,
David Rockefeller:
"[The] nation state as a fundamental unit of
man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force.
International banks and multinational corporations are acting and
planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of
the nation state."
Several other noteworthy Trilateral members:
The first three men helped sink the US further
into debt by fomenting wars abroad; and Gore's cap and trade blueprint would
destroy industrial economies, while vastly increasing the numbers of people
in Third World countries who have no access to modern sources of energy.
Does all this offer a clue as to why the US economy has failed to recover
from the Wall Street debacle of 2008, why the federal bailout was a handout
to super-rich criminals, and why Obama took actions which prevented a
recovery?
A closer look at Tim Geithner's circle of economic advisers reveals the
chilling Trilateral effect:
-
Paul Volker
-
Alan Greenspan
-
E. Gerald Corrigan (director, Goldman
Sachs)
-
Peter G Peterson (former CEO, Lehman
Brothers, former chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations)
These men are all Trilateral members.
How many foxes in the hen house do we need, before we realize their
Trilateral agenda is controlling the direction of our economy?
The TC has no interest in building up the American economy. They want to
torpedo it, as part of the end-game of creating a new international
currency, ushering in a de facto Globalist management system for the whole
planet.
Any doubt on the question of TC goals is answered by David Rockefeller
himself, the founder of the TC, in his Memoirs (2003):
"Some even believe we are part of a secret
cabal working against the best interests of the United States,
characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring
with others around the world to build a more integrated global political
and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that is the charge,
I stand guilty, and I am proud of it."
Even in what many people mistakenly think of as
the TC's heyday, the 1970s, there were few who realized its overarching
power.
Here is a close-up snap shot of a remarkable moment from out of the past.
It's a through-the-looking-glass secret - in the form of a conversation
between a reporter, Jeremiah Novak, and two Trilateral Commission
members, Karl Kaiser and Richard Cooper.
The interview took place in 1978. It concerned
the issue of who exactly, during President Carter's administration, was
formulating US economic and political policy.
The careless and off-hand attitude of Trilateralists Kaiser and Cooper is
astonishing.
It's as if they're saying,
"What we're revealing is already out in the
open, it's too late to do anything about it, why are you so worked up,
we've already won..."
NOVAK (the reporter): Is it true that a private [Trilateral committee]
led by Henry Owen of the US and made up of [Trilateral] representatives
of the US, UK, West Germany, Japan, France and the EEC is coordinating
the economic and political policies of the Trilateral countries [which
would include the US]?
COOPER: Yes, they have met three times.
NOVAK: Yet, in your recent paper you state that this committee should
remain informal because to formalize 'this function might well prove
offensive to some of the Trilateral and other countries which do not
take part.' Who are you afraid of?
KAISER: Many countries in Europe would resent the dominant role that
West Germany plays at these [Trilateral] meetings.
COOPER: Many people still live in a world of separate nations, and they
would resent such coordination [of policy].
NOVAK: But this [Trilateral] committee is essential to your whole
policy. How can you keep it a secret or fail to try to get popular
support [for its decisions on how Trilateral member nations will conduct
their economic and political policies]?
COOPER: Well, I guess it's the press' job to publicize it.
NOVAK: Yes, but why doesn't President Carter come out with it and tell
the American people that [US] economic and political power is being
coordinated by a [Trilateral] committee made up of Henry Owen and six
others? After all, if [US] policy is being made on a multinational level,
the people should know.
COOPER: President Carter and Secretary of State Vance have constantly
alluded to this in their speeches.
KAISER: It just hasn't become an issue.

Of course, although Kaiser and Cooper claimed
everything being manipulated by the Trilateral Commission committee was
already out in the open, it wasn't.
Their interview slipped under the mainstream media radar, which is to say,
it was ignored and buried. It didn't become a scandal on the level of, say,
Watergate, although its essence was far larger than Watergate.
US economic and political policy run by a committee of the Trilateral
Commission - the Commission had been been created in 1973 as an "informal
discussion group" by David Rockefeller and his sidekick, Zbigniew
Brzezinski, who would become Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor.
Shortly after Carter won the presidential election, his aide, Hamilton
Jordan, said that if after the inauguration, Cy Vance and Brzezinski came on
board as secretary of state and national security adviser,
"We've lost. And I'll quit."
Lost - because both men were powerful members of
the Trilateral Commission and their appointment to key positions would
signal a surrender of White House control to the Commission.
Vance and Brzezinski were appointed secretary of state and national security
adviser, as Jordan feared. But he didn't quit. He became Carter's chief of
staff.
Now consider the vast propaganda efforts of the past 40 years, on so many
levels, to install the idea that all nations and peoples of the world are a
single Collective.
From a very high level of political and economic power, this propaganda op
has had the objective of grooming the population for a planet that is one
coagulated mass, run and managed by one force.
A central engine of that force is the Trilateral
Commission.
