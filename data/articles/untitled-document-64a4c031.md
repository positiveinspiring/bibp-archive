Letter from Arndt Krupp's Swiss
law firm, Senn, Christians and Letermeyer, addressed to Herr Clem
T. Santiago of the Krupp Heritage & World Peace Foundation. Nicolaud
Senn is the Hon. Chairman on the Union Bank of Switzerland, one of
the principal banks where Santa Romana gold and other WWII loot was
deposited.
It is not without some interest
that Santa Romana used a number of assumed names (aka's) when setting
upthe numerous Black Eagle bank accounts. The list of these aka's
runs to aproximately 30 in total.
One of those he used is none
other than Clemente Santiago. I have been told (but cannot yet corroborate)
that the late Baron Krupp obtained access to these Santa Romana "Santiago"
accounts at UBS by deception.
If that proves to have been
the case, it is likely, even probable, that this resulted from a strategem
of using the similar name of Clem T. Santiago. The latter is believed
to be a relative of Konsehala Candelarin V. Santiago one of the three
"most trusted" women of Ferdinand Marcos. Use Such a ploy
would also explain how Marcos managed to steal some of Santa Romana's
accounts.
That they are not the one and
identical Clemente Santiago is established by the simple expediency
of comparing their respective birth dates. Santa Romana was born on
29th February 1908 in Cabanatuan City, province of Nueva Poiza, Philippines.
The copy of the Clemente T. Santiago passport I have as part of the
Krupp documents reveals the birth date to be 26th February 1925, with
the place of birth being Santa Cruz, Laguna, Philippines.
One cannot help wondering if
this fraud was achieved through the intermediation of Nicolaus Senn,
the Hon. Chairman of UBS? Senn and his law firm partners were, according
to another Krupp document (see krupp4) paid a very hansome fee of
3% on US$112 billion to compensate them for their effort. That is
to say that each partner of the Zurich law firm were to be remunerated
to the sum of $1.1 billion each, for the "services" they
rendered to Baron Krupp in this transaction.
It is also of intererest that
another aka used by Santa Romana was "General Edward Lansdale"
who had worked with Santa Romana in the Philippines. The "real"
general Lansdale had also, I understand, tried to obtain, by deception,
Santa Romana "Lansdale" UBS accounts - but failed to succeed.
