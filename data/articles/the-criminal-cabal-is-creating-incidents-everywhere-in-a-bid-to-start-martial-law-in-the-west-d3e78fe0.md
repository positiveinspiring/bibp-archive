What do,
...all have in common?
The answer is they are all desperate maneuvers by criminal Western oligarchs
hoping to start World War 3 and keep themselves in power via martial law.
It
is also a symptom of the extreme, desperate power struggle now unfolding in
Washington D.C. Although some are hoping for imminent announcements the
nightmare has ended, this struggle is likely to continue into the autumn and
possibly beyond.
Much of the maneuvering behind the scenes is linked to obscure bonds with
astronomical (theoretical) face value.
Although most of these bonds have a legitimate history behind them, giving
the owners the right to cash them would also mean handing over vast power
now in the possession of the
Federal Reserve Board crime syndicate.
One example of the type of maneuvering that is going on is that Dick Cheney
has been trying to buy all the Mexican peso and Mexican silver-backed bonds
he can get his hands on. This implies there will be yet another attempt to
revive
the Amero plan because only then would owning lots of Mexican pesos
suddenly make sense.
The key power brokers in Washington these days are, according to US-based
high level intelligence sources (and common sense):
Their latest plan still involves having Vice-President
Biden resign soon
because of a brain tumor, so that he can be replaced with Hillary Clinton.
Obama would then be ousted because of his foreign birth and homosexual
entanglements.
What these people fear the most is a genuine people-based revolution in the
US.
For that reason, they must get their hands on large amounts of money to
spread around. The Feds are therefore trying to work out a back-room deal
with their financial opponents that would allow the Fed to survive in
exchange for vast pay-offs.
Insiders aware of this situation are responding by dumping US dollars in
favor of anything else. Gold is also being sold to insiders at 28 dollars an
ounce, which is why the gold price is suddenly falling.
There is also an intensified campaign underway to stifle dissent with
increased discipline of the military, public announcements the US government
will kill Americans extra-judicially (as if they have not already being
doing just that), and a heavy crack-down on journalists.
The various incidents being fomented world-wide, meanwhile, seem designed to
usher in fascist rule in the West:
In South America we have the Columbian puppet-state trying to foment war
with Venezuela using doctored satellite photos.
In central Asia the US military seems to have deliberately leaked
information detrimental to Pakistan so they can shift the blame on Afghan
failure to them even as the US cabal continues to finance both the Taliban
and the NATO troops fighting them. Is the planned end-game a nuclear
incident?
Then in Asia we have the Chinese government saying UFOs being spotted are of
terrestrial origin. These are secret US military air-craft that have
attacked Chinese oil facilities, according to a Chinese source.
As reported in our free blog, a KGB source warns of a Weapon of Mass
Destruction incident in Tokyo to be blamed on North Korea. Although
announcing such plans beforehand often helps derail them, it may be prudent
to get out of Tokyo on the August 6th Hiroshima anniversary.
In Japan, meanwhile, secret negotiations are taking place aimed at unifying
the rump of the old Liberal Democratic Party with the now ruling Democratic
Party of Japan. This would be a marriage of the old money-politics (LDP)
with the new regime. Under this scenario Prime Minister Kan would lose power
in September.
Holding their cards close and acting passively for now can be found a
super-secret committee of powerful individuals. They are still saying the
swamp must be fully drained before all the swamp creatures can be exposed.
The Vatican is also headed for a major housecleaning. There is much we are
being asked not to report at this time but corrupt Vatican officials and
others are now under 24-hour surveillance.
The Chinese, for their part, know that time is on their side. They will
continue developing peacefully as will most of the rest of the world.
The world will continue to have to watch with disgust as the Western
governments continue their mass murder, pillage, drug-dealing and other
anti-social activities they like to call Geopolitics.
Historians will long
ponder the causes of this ongoing collapse of the West but those of us on
the ground know the cause: rampant greed and bottomless corruption.
