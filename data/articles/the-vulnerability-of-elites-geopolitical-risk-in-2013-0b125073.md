Categorizing the major themes, risks,
opportunities, and wild cards
based on discussions of the Global Agenda
Council on Geopolitical Risk
in Dubai, November 2012.
Introduction
In a post-financial crisis world, the lack of viable international
leadership is in stark relief.
As the
Global Agenda Council on Geopolitical Risk's 2012
report highlighted, the effectiveness of global institutions and the rise of
regionalism are overarching themes defining world events.
In 2013, this breakdown of international
coordination will go increasingly local: in such a world, governments will
focus more on their domestic agendas, which will create new risks in and of
itself. Most importantly, the growing vulnerability of elites makes
effective public and private leadership that much more difficult to sustain.
Leaders of all kinds are becoming more
vulnerable to their constituents, generating more reactive and short-term
governance. Whether one looks at the dismal approval ratings of the U.S.
Congress or the impact that more open flows of information is having on the
Chinese ruling elite, it is clear that people are becoming more and more
uninspired by their governments.
When it comes to unemployment, the widening
disparity of wealth, or environmental degradation, highly complex or even
intractable issues set politicians up for failure in the eyes of their
constituents.
Underperformance erodes elites' legitimacy, making it that much harder for
them to lead effectively.
States captured by corruption or special
interests, or that exhibit a lack of transparency, growing disparity of
wealth, or a perceived indifference to the lives of the citizenry, will
increasingly fall victim to this 'legitimacy deficit.' Corporate and NGO
leaders who act with impropriety can also find the ground shifting beneath
their feet, sometimes overnight.
Rapid news cycles and social media can allow
dissident movements to arise without warning, creating new challenges for
those in charge.
Against this backdrop, a host of key 2013 risks and opportunities takes
shape.
-
Tensions between China and Japan are
likely to worsen.
-
The spill over from the Syrian civil war
will have severe knock-on effects throughout the region.
-
The Iranian nuclear threat,
Afghanistan-Pakistan conflict in the wake of US 2014 withdrawal, and
Eurozone crisis response are other key risks.
Opportunities could arise from a brighter US
outlook and continuity in its government.
A growing awareness of the lack of international
leadership may impel political leaders to deal with issues locally, and
could result in better crisis response. In addition, there are a host of
wildcards - on the downside and upside - that could prove game-changers over
the coming year.
Discussion will break down into categories as follows:
-
A. Overview - The Vulnerability of
Elites
-
Key Risks
-
Wildcards
-
Opportunities
A. Overview - The
Vulnerability of Elites The challenge
The vulnerability of elites cuts across emerging markets and advanced
economies, democracies and authoritarian states, public and private
institutions, and a wide array of issues.
This is the challenge: as their legitimacy gets
called into question, political actors struggle to react to instability,
crises and opportunities in the most effective manner.
Whether it is the growing disparity of wealth,
or the evolving flow of information, several factors are facilitating
pushback against existing policies and institutions and making both
governments and some private actors across the globe look increasingly
fragile.
- First, the 'Occupy' movement may have run
out of steam, but the slogan "we are the 99%" has put an end to the
people's "peaceful coexistence with inequality."
While the richest have come out on top from
the economic crisis, middle classes are experiencing reversals in their
standards of living even in the developed world. In many developed and
emerging countries, youth unemployment rates are scandalously high.
A 'lost' generation of young people feel
they have no stake in the existing system. And this development is
occurring in a world where inequality is visible on a daily basis, both
within and between societies. The lack of economic prospects has eroded
people's trust in, and support for, their political leaders, whose
actions are rarely understood, let alone approved.
The result is a "legitimacy deficit" and a sense that we might nearly be
better off without rulers. Leaders no longer have a story to rally their
followers around. The few who do fare better than others. We're seeing
this trend across countries of vastly different stages of development.
- Second, people are less willing to tolerate corruption, crime,
cronyism and other forms of inappropriate behavior by leaders.
Most societies lack a clear moral compass in
the form of religion, ideology or established values. The media are
quick to fill this vacuum with instant moral outrage about the latest
scandal - and the news cycle is short-sighted at the expense of
longer-term problems that are more pressing.
Consider some of the events that dominated
headlines in the past year:
-
revelations of phone hacking by
News-Corp
-
the resignation of CIA director
David Petraeus
-
the demonstrations that erupted
after a gang rape in India
-
the cover-up of sexual misconduct
within the BBC
Among other things, these events show that the
spread of the internet and social media has made it much harder for leaders
to engage in "damage control."
It has given people a tool to hold their leaders
to account and, in extremis, to topple them. Nowadays, even rather innocuous
private misdemeanors can end a distinguished political or corporate career
overnight.
Governments, companies, even large media
organizations, are ill-equipped to handle the "tyranny of real time." More
than ever, knowledge is power - and more than ever, knowledge has been
democratized. Anyone with an Internet connection can access diplomatic
cables revealing inconvenient truths about their rulers.
In developed democracies, scandals involving leaders can distract
whole nations for weeks on end, while more important business remains
undone. Greater transparency may yield many important benefits, but it can
also pollute short-term agendas.
Growing disenchantment with political leaders
may discourage the best and brightest from entering politics in the first
place. Instead of imagination, conviction, and leadership skills, a
blemish-free past is becoming the real entry criteria for Western
governments. While a longer-term generational shift could ease this
phenomenon, for the foreseeable future, the trend will likely only worsen.
Overall, however, in established democracies the damage stemming from elite
vulnerability is limited by the existence of stable institutions.
If a minister, general, or even a president is
pushed out, there is a well-rehearsed and accepted process for replacing him
or her. In less democratic societies, by contrast, public scrutiny may not
burden leaders quite so continuously. But the risks associated with elite
vulnerability are considerably higher. Revelations about elite corruption
and double standards can galvanize people into street action and even
revolution.
From Russia to China, leaders' wealth is
increasingly exposed.
Public anger at corruption and disparities of
wealth also played a clear role in the 'Arab Spring,' and it remains to be
seen whether the region's monarchs will remain protected by tradition or end
up having no clothes.
In emerging markets countries, the growing ranks of the middle classes will
increasingly translate into pressure on authorities to deliver everything
from goods and services to property rights, freedom of information, and
political rights and civil liberties.
Regimes that are successful in improving living
standards and increasing the size of the middle class may subsequently
struggle with their aspirations - and the reduced likelihood that they will
remain willing to abide by the terms of the previous social contract.
This dynamic was among those at work in the Arab
Spring, where GDP growth and a larger demographic cohort of
university-educated citizens ultimately expected more from government.
Elites that are not perceived to have earned their status fairly tend to be
the most fragile.
If a leader in an autocratic society is forced
out by public outrage, leadership battles that can destabilize the whole
political system are likely to ensue. To avoid this, vulnerable leaders
often search for distractions and scapegoats.
Take China, for example, where the leadership
may focus on quelling transparency into its dealings at the expense of
enacting much-needed governance or reform. External enemies are blown up,
potential opponents are crushed and sabres are rattled. Vulnerable elites
can be unpredictable.
All of this takes place against the backdrop of a deglobalizing world.
The new local
The threat to elites' legitimacy varies considerably between regions and
even neighbors. In a similar fashion, the risk landscape in 2013 is
increasingly disparate.
There is no single, overarching risk that could
destabilize international politics or derail the global economy. Instead, a
myriad of local pressure points exist, from the escalating tensions between
China and Japan to the bloodshed in Syria and the ongoing crisis in the
Eurozone. Such risks have regional spill over effects but none of them has
the capacity to become an 'umbrella' calamity that becomes a global
priority.
Welcome to 'the new local,' where governments
are more shackled by regional concerns and their domestic constituencies -
at the expense of tackling larger-scale global issues that need collective
leadership to solve. Paradoxically, secessionism is on the rise just as one
would expect support for more integrated solutions to increasingly intricate
problems.
The world today lacks an overarching and accepted model of development and
progress.
Many people believe that the global financial
and economic crisis has discredited market capitalism. Institutions of
global governance look weak. Regional ones are slow to take their place (see
our report last year). The Lehman collapse, Abu Ghraib and Afghanistan have
all eroded American soft power.
With Europe in deep crisis, the idea that there
is a "Western" model that should be followed can no longer easily be sold.
Many people in Asia, Africa and elsewhere do not think that democracy is a
panacea. Perpetually waiting until after the next election to take action
does not seem attractive or efficient.
Even the Arab Spring was not so much about
democracy as about transparency and accountability - ingredients that can be
supplied to some extent by stable non-democratic systems.
Globalization itself is no longer the
unquestioned unifier that drives global markets. Nor is there a clear
alternative model. For many leaders around the world, the idea that there
could be economic development without the 'messy business' of democracy is
an appealing one.
However, autocratic systems tend to be rigid and
therefore likely to crack under pressure. The notion that development and
happiness can come from authoritarian state capitalism hinges on little more
than China's year-on-year growth rates and exceptional experience over the
past decade. Should China break, an entire worldview will likely come to an
end.
The deglobalization of risk exacerbates old
problems - and ushers in some new ones. Paradoxically, the fact that spill-overs
are not global makes the outbreak of local conflicts more likely.
During the Cold War years, any skirmish between
the two Germanys would have escalated to a third world war. Today, China and
Japan know that a tit-for-tat over
the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands can be pushed
much further before it precipitates a broader international response.
This knowledge might make actors more reckless -
and cause more damage.
Just look at the drop-off in Japanese exports in
China in the wake of the recent crisis.
B. Key Risks China-Japan
As previously mentioned, the risk that China-Japan relations could worsen
and the two nations head for a naval confrontation over the Senkaku/Diaoyu
islands is high.
Although pragmatic solutions are conceivable,
this conflict is not ultimately about territory. For both countries, it is
an opportunity to project power in a region that is in transition. And in
both countries, domestic political factors are pushing towards escalation:
Japan's government-weakened by economic woes and internal divisions-may want
to send a signal that Japan is not a country in terminal decline.
In China, a newly installed leadership may find
anti-Japanese nationalism the easiest way of gaining popularity. In a world
with vulnerable political elites, China and Japan's leadership may have more
cause to shore up their popularity by stoking nationalist sentiment.
Bilateral relations between the two countries
are tense and trade is already suffering.
China feels it needs neither Japanese capital
nor Japanese technology nowadays, which it can now import from places such
as Korea or Taiwan. Japan hopes for US support, including a new treaty that
could further align America with Japanese interests.
Although the US is torn between pivot and disengagement, it remains the only
power that can play the role of a mediator or help with conflict prevention
in Asia.
While it is probably not in a position to
prevent an incident between China and Japan, it should be able to forestall
a wider conflict. Yet uncertainties about the meaning and commitment of the
US "pivot to Asia" have left critical concerns unaddressed.
If the US is not understood by its Asian allies,
how can it avoid misunderstandings with its largest competitor?
Syria and its spill over
The
conflict in Syria will drag on in 2013 and
is likely to engulf more actors than expected to date.
While eyes were on Turkey and Lebanon in 2012,
they could be on Iraq and Jordan in 2013. Although neither side admits it,
the war in Syria is effectively in a stalemate, even if things are changing
gradually. Even though Syrian opposition leaders agreed to form a coalition
in November 2012 in Doha, a political settlement looks no closer.
What is more, following the intense outside
pressure that led to the formation of the coalition, it might now be tainted
as the "US council" for Syria, just as NATO seeks to avoid being drawn into
the country through its Turkish member.
If Assad does fall, events could accelerate unpredictably and
uncontrollably.
Even if there is a workable peace deal in Syria,
democracy and stability are unlikely to follow. In an interesting repeat of
history, the question is again about what happens the "day after."
The possibility of mass revenge killings or
territorial fragmentation of the state cannot be ruled out.
The turmoil in Syria is already providing
fertile ground for a re-emergence of Al-Qaeda - an organization that has
also operated in a 'new local,' splintering its actions into more granular
arenas, often working at a sub-regional level. Expect that to continue
unabated if a post-Assad power vacuum emerges.
On Syria, Russia and China continue to stand in the way of an international
intervention.
Vladimir Putin is unlikely to give up his
opposition to outside interference - even if the other powers on the UN
Security Council were to give him much of the credit for 'solving' the Syria
conflict. The Chinese government remains on the sidelines, showing limited
signs of leadership by issuing a brief forward-looking plan, yet still
fearful that any support for the Syrian opposition might encourage a Uighur
uprising in Xinjiang province.
The West, for its part, is torn between moral
values and a lack of hard interests justifying boots on the ground. While it
seeks to avoid profound involvement, it is also concerned with not losing
its diplomatic hold on the situation.
The ongoing battle in Syria is radicalizing and destabilizing the region,
opening for the first time a real - if still distant -
possibility that the map of the Middle East may be redrawn. Turkey, Iran and
Arab states like Saudi Arabia are key actors in Syria but they do not trust
each other and no side wants to see the other gain the upper hand.
Often their initiatives are aimed at containing
each other, rather than at stopping the bloodshed.
Turkey's position is particularly complex. On the one hand, Ankara could not
allow President Assad to crush the uprising and re-constitute his regime. On
the other hand, a large-scale military intervention would strengthen once
again the position of the Turkish military in domestic politics - and thus
undo one of Prime Minister Erdogan's greatest personal victories.
Moreover, Turkish businesses - many of
which support Erdogan's government - are against military intervention,
fearing the economic turmoil that would inevitably follow.
The fault lines of the Syrian crisis are also running through Iraq, where
both the Kurds and the Sunnis see the turmoil as an opportunity to remove (Shia)
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
The Kurds are keen to consolidate their gains in
terms of autonomy and economic independence (some oil companies now prefer
to sign deals with Erbil than with Baghdad) and the Sunnis are aggrieved
because they believe they may have given up arms too fast as they have not
gained sufficiently from power sharing and compromise.
Both are spoiling for a fight. Sectarianism is
turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
If Iraq erupts into civil war, Iran would
certainly be drawn in.
The Iran-Israel-US nuclear dynamic
Although both candidates in the US presidential election promised that they
would not
allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, a re-elected President
Obama will remain very cautious about the use of force.
There might even be an opportunity for a major
diplomatic initiative.
- First, international sanctions on Iran
appear to be biting. By the end of 2012 the Iranian currency had fallen
by 40% and there were uprisings in the bazaars. Economic turmoil makes
the Iranian government increasingly vulnerable; it could drive Tehran
towards bilateral negotiations.
- Second, the Iranian presidential election
in mid-2013 will almost certainly not feature incumbent Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, as he is constitutionally required to stand down from
office at the end of his term. The new president will have just as
little real power, which will remain firmly in the hands of Supreme
Leader Khamenei.
But a new, more conciliatory president could
change the mood music in Iranian-American relations, particularly if the US
seeks to constructively seize this opportunity.
Some have rumored the possibility of a secret
Nixon-like deal. Yet the Kissinger-designed overture of 1972 was made
possible only by carefully concealed groundwork of the like precluded by
today's levels of real-time transparency.
However, there are just as many reasons to believe that diplomacy will stall
and tensions between Iran and Israel and the US will intensify. In any
negotiations, Tehran would be seeking a grand bargain that includes not only
its nuclear program but also regional stability (for example the role of
Hezbollah), the future of Syria and relations with Israel.
However, Washington might not be able to
negotiate such a deal.
American politicians have demonized Iran to such
an extent that anything that does not look like 'complete surrender' might
be impossible to sell politically at home. The US may therefore demand that
Iran first comply with all international requests regarding its nuclear
program before wider negotiations may start. Iran would reject such terms.
In the absence of constructive talks, regime vulnerabilities in both Iran
and Israel may lead to escalating tensions. Israel lacks the strategic
military capability to destroy Iran's nuclear program but it can damage it.
Israeli hardliners such as Avigdor Lieberman may call for such strikes to
strengthen their position.
But the leadership in Tehran may even think that
a limited number of attacks would help it consolidate its grip on power - it
might be just what they need to deflect domestic anger toward an exogenous
threat.
Insofar as Israel realizes this - and outspoken
security personnel embed it into popular opinion - it could minimize the
chance of strikes.
A currently tamed discussion might emerge over
whether Iran's nuclear status in itself matters most or whether a deeper
rethinking of the country's regional relations is needed.
The Af-Pak region
The future of Afghanistan - and the Af-Pak region as a whole - hangs
in the balance as the US prepares to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan by
2014.
On the upside, Afghan leaders may realize that
they now need a settlement, and one that includes the Taliban. Afghanistan's
neighbors may take a stronger and more responsible role in seeking a
settlement, fearing the power vacuum that would follow an implosion in
Afghanistan.
However, the impending transition in Afghanistan also creates risks.
The ability of the Afghan national forces to
guarantee security is yet to be tested. The Najibullah regime collapsed in
the early 1990s as soon as the Soviet Union stopped supplying arms. There
are doubts whether the regime of Hamid Karzai can survive without US and
NATO support. The risk is that of a return to a pre-2001 landscape. The
risks to Afghanistan's transition lie in the complex militia structures that
dominate the region, and the Taliban's continuing ability to be vastly
destructive.
The rivalry between India and Pakistan could further destabilize the
situation in Afghanistan. India is helping to train Afghan security forces
and keeps strengthening its ties with the Northern Alliance while Pakistan
supports the Pashtun tribes.
Increased Pakistani involvement in the country
is likely as all players gear-up for of a post-2014 political environment.
As relations between India and Pakistan are
already strained - although not, by any metric, to the extent that they have
been in the past - any further terror attacks or hijackings in India (which
would be blamed on Pakistan) could lead to conflict, which would further
divert New Delhi's attention from an important but lagging domestic agenda
(itself marked by the red thread of anti-corruption and elite
vulnerability).
India's frustration with its neighbor's reaction
to its involvement in Afghanistan may be underestimated.
Eurozone crisis response
The weakness of governments in Europe has
shifted the locus of crisis response from governments to the European
Central Bank.
After two years of successive bailouts,
governments in Germany, Austria, Finland and the Netherlands cannot ask
their parliaments to agree to the sums that would be necessary to stabilize
large countries such as Italy and Spain.
Further requests for ever larger bailouts could
drive voters into the arms of euro-skeptic or nationalist parties, such as
the True Finns in Finland or Austria's Freedom Party (in Germany, no
euroskeptic party has emerged so far).
Meanwhile, in the struggling debtor countries, politicians are finding it
harder to push through further austerity and reforms after years of
recession and rising unemployment. Their standing is becoming increasingly
tenuous.
Political elites are well aware of the impact
that public frustration can have in the voting booth - and on the streets.
Support for the fascist
Golden Dawn in Greece reached 14% in
November 2012. The populist 'Five Star' movement of Pepe Grillo in Italy is
coming out on top in some polls. Separatist forces are gathering momentum in
Spain.
The inability of governments to act swiftly and decisively in the crisis has
left the European Central Bank as the only effective actor.
The announcement of the ECB's OMT (open market
transactions) program for buying government bonds and reducing borrowing
costs calmed markets in the second half of 2013 - but the Eurozone's
increasing reliance on the ECB itself creates growing risks in 2013.
Central banks are neither democratically
legitimized nor democratic. Those countries, like Spain, that hope for ECB
action to avoid a financial crisis want the ECB to act swiftly, decisively
and predictably. Germany and other countries with orthodox views on central
banking are deeply concerned about the central bank's expanding remit.
Both sides may look for ways of subjecting the
ECB to stronger political oversight. Calls for its minutes to be made public
come from the same vein of transparency that has, for better or for worse,
created the vulnerability of established elites elsewhere.
This could make it increasingly difficult for
the ECB to act.
C. Wildcards Eurozone exit
Wildcards are unpredictable but plausible events that might derail
predictions and risk assessments.
The most pressing wildcard in 2013 would be a
Eurozone exit - while unlikely, it cannot be ruled out. If a government
collapsed in one of the countries relying on EU bailouts, reforms there
would stall and further aid would not be forthcoming, given the restive mood
in the donor countries. For example, if Greece's fragile coalition
government unraveled, the country may yet be forced out of the Eurozone.
The threat of a domino effect throughout the
periphery is a wildcard of the first order.
It could lead to the creation of a new class of
"formerly rich" nations in what has been one of the most stable areas of the
world for decades. It would also contribute to making supra-national
decision-making even more rare in a context where the EU has already lost
its status as "global do-gooder."
New anti-establishment parties pay noticeably
little attention to foreign policy, focused as they are on rewriting
national agendas.
Cyber attack
The hacker group Anonymous, for its part, has begun showing signs that it
may seek to use its power in support of a foreign policy of its own. In
November 2012, it threatened Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi with cyber
attack should he seek to expand his powers too far.
A massive cyber attack is certainly possible in
2013, whether on a corporation's intellectual property, a country's critical
infrastructure, or a government's secrets. In a world of vulnerable elites,
the latter could have unanticipated impact, particularly in more
authoritarian regimes.
Many governments not only cannot protect their
critical infrastructure from cyber attacks - they admit they are not even
equipped to measure the full scope of their infrastructural vulnerabilities.
An attack could be damaging in and of itself.
The knock-on effects could have far-reaching
geopolitical, economic or security implications. It would also demonstrate
the seriousness of the threat that emanates from cyber crime.
Just as the use of drones is rapidly being
democratized with dangerous consequences for the monopoly of political
violence, the lesson of cyber weapons may be that "you reap what you sow."
Hopefully, a cyber Cuban crisis will lead to a
code of conduct before we run into a cyber Pearl Harbor.
Other threats
Even though Al Qaeda demonstrates
'the new local' phenomenon, there is always a chance that it returns as a
global threat. We cannot rule out an Arab Spring 2.0.
Could the Gulf region, Jordan, or Morocco be the
next area affected by uprisings? What happens if China experiences its own
version of Wikileaks?
The temporary disappearance of Xi Jinping in
September 2012 caused confusion enough, despite being a non-event. In that
vein, a new Green revolution in Iran is a possibility, as is a third
intifada. The assassination of a leader in Afghanistan, India or Pakistan
could have calamitous impact on the tensions in the Af-Pak region.
Can Nigeria maintain its unity? If not, what
would this mean for the power projection of Africa's largest peacekeeper?
The risk of jihad-ism and organized crime
developing more stable cooperative relations in the Sahel Zone is growing,
with the potential to destabilize Mauritania or Niger.
Some bright spots
Bear in mind that wildcards can surprise on the upside too.
To an extent, Myanmar's impressive opening to
the world was one such case in 2012. Looking ahead, while the situation in
China-Japan is likely to deteriorate, the dispute over the islands might
also bring certain opportunities: China and Japan may agree to intensify
their exchange to minimize the risk of conflict.
The comeback of Shinzo Abe in Japan may enable
China and Japan to make a deal over the Diaoyu/Senkaku disputes, as Abe's
conservative background gives him more leeway - just like what he did in
2007 over the Yasukuni Shrine debacle.
We could see a surprise to the upside in the Eurozone if European
governments take the lull as an opportunity to make progress towards fiscal
and banking union while southern Europe implements the reforms necessary to
restore competitiveness and growth.
In China, the revelation of major scandals
involving officials and the ensuing public outcry (mostly via the internet)
could even force the new leadership to adopt new measures to increase the
supervision of governments and officials, thus pushing forward
institution-building. A bright wildcard could be the possibility of Russia
and the US (and perhaps China) agreeing on a common post-Assad peacekeeping
mission in Syria, or a common UNSC initiative to that effect.
An Israeli Prime Minister could take the lead in
a surprisingly vivid peace process. An Iranian overture could come from
either side of the Atlantic.
D. Opportunities
The deglobalisation of risk
As risk becomes increasingly deglobalized, it creates problems but also
opportunities.
Since risks are not global, world powers, most
notably the US, are less likely to get engaged militarily. Knowing this,
local actors may assume more responsibility for solving conflicts that
affect them directly, rather than waiting for outsiders to step in.
In lieu of international solutions that could
misinterpret the nuances of the situation or mistakenly institute a
cookie-cutter approach to disparate problems, we could instead see local
resolutions that are more handcrafted to the specific issues in play.
In other words, if 'the new local' means an outsized focus on regional and
domestic issues, perhaps the extra attention can bear fruit.
Barack Obama's re-election and a brighter
United States
In a world of constant change, sometimes consistency in and of itself can
lead to opportunities.
The re-election of Barack Obama as American
president promises a certain amount of continuity in US foreign policy. This
should be a stabilizing factor globally.
At the same time, new appointments in leading
positions might help to bring movement to established problems, for example,
by offering a diplomatic initiative for Iran or indeed North Korea (of
course, there is always a risk that the reverse could prove true).
A second Obama administration has an opportunity to move beyond the focus on
"wars on " - notably the war on terror and the war on drugs. Such a shift
would free up resources for more pragmatic solutions. Also, America's allies
would no longer have to prove their credentials in the war on terror to get
on America's good side.
In a second term, Obama may even focus more on foreign policy in Asia, in
line with his pivot policy. He may try to better engage with North Korea and
its new young leader, Kim Jong Un, and the change of president in South
Korea could facilitate this process with a leader likely to adopt a less
hostile and more conciliatory posture toward Pyongyang.
The US economy may well surprise on the upside in 2013. In an improved
economic environment, foreign trade diplomacy could intensify.
A global approach may no longer be taken for
granted, but that need not lead to a losing situation. In fact, it opens new
opportunities, from bilateral to regional agreements. Doha is dead; long
live the king of trade. Obama may well offer a NAFTA-plus pact to Brazil. If
Brazil declines (or even independent of developments on this front), Obama
may focus on enlarging and expediting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, perhaps
pushing harder for Japanese inclusion.
Such an agreement between countries comprising
some 40% of global GDP would have far-reaching security and economic
implications, particularly for North America and the Asia Pacific region.
Progress on an Atlantic equivalent - which is being billed as an 'economic
NATO' - may seem beyond the horizon. But the potential for surprisingly
rapid progress could turn this pipedream into an explicit goal over the
course of the year.
In the natural resources sector as well, local prospects are more
significant than ever.
While some argue the North American energy boom
could lead to a globalized gas market based on extensive LNG circulation, it
is first and foremost based on a shale revolution that could lead to reduced
global interdependencies.
Should it decide to exploit its own reserves, or
collaborate with regional partners such as Algeria, Europe could, for
example, reduce its dependence on its tough Russian supplier.
Prepared for the challenges
At a minimum, at least many of the shortcomings of international leadership
are clearly signposted for all to see, and governments, multinational
corporations, and large organizations can adapt accordingly.
In the world of 'the new local,' where
increasingly vulnerable political elites have their hands full with issues
in their own neighborhoods, we won't see resolution on big-ticket items like
climate change, revamped trade built on the tenets of globalization, or a
broad approach to curbing nuclear proliferation.
Where leaders can diagnose this new reality,
they can learn to adapt to it. In 'the new local,' finding more localized
fixes to problems will prove the way forward.
Political elites cannot let the perfect be the
enemy of the good - partial solutions are still progress, and incremental
steps are still steps in the right direction.
