The National Security Agency paid millions
of dollars to cover the costs of major internet companies involved in
the
Prism
surveillance program after a court ruled that some of the agency's
activities were unconstitutional, according to top-secret material
passed to the Guardian.
The technology companies, which
the
NSA says includes,
...incurred the costs to meet new certification
demands in the wake of the ruling from the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance ()
court.
The October 2011 judgment,
which was
declassified on Wednesday by the
Obama administration, found that the
's
inability to separate purely domestic communications from foreign
traffic violated the fourth amendment.
While
the ruling did not concern the
program directly, documents passed to the Guardian by whistleblower
Edward Snowden describe the problems the decision created for the agency
and the efforts required to bring operations into compliance.
The
material provides the first evidence of a financial relationship between
the tech companies and the
.
The intelligence agency requires
the
Fisa Court to sign annual "certifications" that provide the legal
framework for surveillance operations. But in the wake of the court
judgment these were only being renewed on a temporary basis while the
agency worked on a solution to the processes that had been ruled
illegal.
An
newsletter entry, marked top secret and dated December 2012, discloses
the huge costs this entailed.
"Last year's problems resulted in multiple
extensions to the certifications' expiration dates which cost millions
of dollars for
providers to implement each successive extension - costs covered by
Special Source Operations," it says.

Special Source Operations, described by
Snowden as the "crown jewel" of the
,
handles all surveillance programs, such as
,
that rely on "corporate partnerships" with telecoms and internet
providers to access communications data.
The disclosure that taxpayers' money was
used to cover the companies' compliance costs raises new questions over
the relationship between Silicon Valley and the
.
Since the existence of the program was first revealed by the Guardian
and the Washington Post on June 6, the companies have repeatedly denied
all knowledge of it and insisted they only hand over user data in
response to specific legal requests from the authorities.
An earlier newsletter, which is undated,
states that the
providers were all given new certifications within days of the
court ruling.
"All Prism providers, except Yahoo and Google, were
successfully transitioned to the new certifications. We expect Yahoo and
Google to complete transitioning by Friday 6 October."

The Guardian invited the companies to
respond to the new material and asked each one specific questions about
the scale of the costs they incurred, the form of the reimbursement and
whether they had received any other payments from the
in relation to the
program.
A Yahoo spokesperson said:
"Federal law
requires the US government to reimburse providers for costs incurred to
respond to compulsory legal process imposed by the government. We have
requested reimbursement consistent with this law."
Asked about the reimbursement of costs
relating to compliance with
court certifications, Facebook responded by saying it had,
"never
received any compensation in connection with responding to a government
data request".
Google did not answer any of the specific
questions put to it, and provided only a general statement denying it
had joined
or any other surveillance program.
It added:
"We await the US
government's response to our petition to publish more national security
request data, which will show that our compliance with American national
security laws falls far short of the wild claims still being made in the
press today."
Microsoft declined to give a response on the
record.
The responses further expose the gap between
how the
describes the operation of its
collection program and what the companies themselves say.
operates under section 702 of the
Amendments Act,
which authorizes the
to target without a
warrant the communications of foreign nationals believed to be not on US
soil.
But Snowden's revelations have shown that US
emails and calls are collected in large quantities in the course of
these 702 operations, either deliberately because the individual has
been in contact with a foreign intelligence target or inadvertently
because the is unable to
separate out purely domestic communications.
Last week,
the Washington Post revealed documents from Snowden that showed the
breached privacy
rules thousands of times a year, in the face of repeated assurances from
Barack Obama and other senior intelligence figures that there was no
evidence of unauthorized surveillance of Americans.
The newly declassified court ruling, by then
chief
judge John Bates, also revealed serious issues with how the
handled the US communications it was sweeping up under its foreign
intelligence authorizations.
The judgment revealed that the
was collecting up
to 56,000 wholly US internet communications per year in the three years
until the court intervened. Bates also rebuked the agency for
misrepresenting the true scope of a major collection program for the
third time in three years.
The
newsletters say the
agency's response to the ruling was to work on a,
"conservative solution
in which higher-risk collection would be sequestered".
At the same time,
one entry states, the NSA's general counsel was considering filing an
appeal.
The Guardian informed the White House, the
and the office of
the director of national intelligence that it planned to publish the
documents and asked whether the spy agency routinely covered all the
costs of the
providers and what the annual cost was to the US.
The
declined to comment
beyond requesting the redaction of the name of an individual staffer in
one of the documents.
UPDATE
After publication, Microsoft issued
a statement to the Guardian on Friday afternoon.
A spokesperson for Microsoft, which seeks
reimbursement from the government on a case-by-case basis, said:
"Microsoft only complies with court orders because it is legally ordered
to, not because it is reimbursed for the work.
We could have a more
informed discussion of these issues if providers could share additional
information, including aggregate statistics on the number of any
national security orders they may receive."
