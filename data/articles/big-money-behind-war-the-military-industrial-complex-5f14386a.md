More than 50 years
after President Eisenhower's warning,
Americans find themselves in perpetual
war.
Perpetual war
represents perpetual profits
for the ever expanding
business and government interests
[AFP]
In January 1961, US President Dwight D Eisenhower used
his farewell address to warn the nation of
what he viewed as one of its greatest threats: the military-industrial
complex composed of military contractors and lobbyists perpetuating war.
Eisenhower warned that,
"an immense military establishment and a
large arms industry" had emerged as a hidden force in US politics and
that Americans "must not fail to comprehend its grave implications".
The speech may have been Eisenhower's most
courageous and prophetic moment.
Fifty years and some later, Americans find
themselves in what seems like perpetual war. No sooner do we draw down on
operations in Iraq than leaders demand an intervention in Libya or Syria or
Iran.
While perpetual war constitutes perpetual losses
for families, and ever expanding budgets, it also represents perpetual
profits for a new and larger complex of business and government interests.
The new military-industrial complex is fuelled by a conveniently ambiguous
and unseen enemy: the terrorist. Former President
George W Bush and his aides insisted on calling
counter-terrorism efforts a "war". This concerted effort by leaders like
former Vice President
Dick Cheney (himself the former CEO of
defence-contractor Halliburton) was not some empty rhetorical exercise.
Not only would a war maximize the inherent
powers of the president, but it would maximize the budgets for military and
homeland agencies.
This new coalition of companies, agencies, and lobbyists dwarfs the system
known by Eisenhower when he warned Americans to,
"guard against the acquisition of
unwarranted influence
by the military-industrial complex".
Ironically, it has had some of its best days
under President
Barack Obama who has radically expanded
drone attacks and claimed that he alone determines what a war is for the
purposes of consulting Congress.
Investment in homeland security companies is expected to yield a 12 percent
annual growth through 2013 - an astronomical return when compared to other
parts of the tanking economy.
Good for economy?
While few politicians are willing to admit it, we don't just endure wars we
seem to need war - at least for some people.
A study showed that roughly 75 percent of the
fallen in these wars come from working class families. They do not need war.
They pay the cost of the war. Eisenhower would likely be appalled by the
size of the industrial and governmental workforce committed to war or
counter-terrorism activities.
Military and homeland budgets now support
millions of people in an otherwise declining economy.
Hundreds of billions of dollars flow each year
from the public coffers to agencies and contractors who have an incentive to
keep the country on a war-footing - and footing the bill for war.
Across the country, the war-based economy can be seen in an industry which
includes everything from Homeland Security educational degrees to
counter-terrorism consultants to private-run preferred traveler programs for
airport security gates.
Recently,
the "black budget"
of secret intelligence programs alone was estimated at $52.6bn for 2013.
That is only the secret programs, not the much
larger intelligence and counterintelligence budgets. We now have 16
spy agencies that employ 107,035 employees. This is separate from the over
one million people employed by the military and national security law
enforcement agencies.
The core of this expanding complex is an axis of influence of,
-
corporations
-
lobbyists
-
agencies,
...that have created a massive, self-sustaining
terror-based industry.
The contractors
In the last eight years, trillions of dollars have flowed to military and
homeland security companies.
When the administration starts a war like Libya,
it is a windfall for companies who are given generous contracts to produce
everything from replacement missiles to ready-to-eat meals.
In the first 10 days of the Libyan war alone, the administration spent
roughly $550m. That figure includes about $340m for munitions - mostly
cruise missiles that must be replaced.
Not only did Democratic members of Congress
offer post-hoc support for the Libyan attack, but they also proposed a
permanent authorization for presidents to attack targets deemed connected to
terrorism - a perpetual
war on terror.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) offers
an even steadier profit margin.
According to Morgan Keegan, a wealth
management and capital firm, investment in homeland security companies is
expected to yield a 12 percent annual growth through 2013 - an astronomical
return when compared to other parts of the tanking economy.
The lobbyists
There are thousands of lobbyists in Washington to guarantee the
ever-expanding budgets for war and homeland security.
One such example is former DHS Secretary
Michael Chertoff who pushed the
purchase of the heavily criticized (and little tested) full-body scanners
used in airports.
When Chertoff was giving dozens of interviews to
convince the public that the machines were needed to hold back the terror
threat, many people were unaware that the manufacturer of the machine is a
client of
the Chertoff Group, his highly profitable
security consulting agency. (Those hugely expensive machines were later
scrapped after
Rapiscan, the manufacturer, received the
windfall.)
Lobbyists maintain pressure on politicians by framing every budget in "tough
on terror" versus "soft on terror" terms. They have the perfect products to
pitch - products that are designed to destroy themselves and be replaced in
an ever-lasting war on terror.
The agencies
It is not just revolving doors that tie federal agencies to these lobbyists
and companies.
The war-based economy allows for military and
homeland departments to be virtually untouchable. Environmental and social
programs are eliminated or curtailed by billions as war-related budgets
continue to expand to meet "new threats".
A massive counterterrorism system has been created employing tens of
thousands of personnel with billions of dollars to search for domestic
terrorists.
With the support of an army of lobbyists and companies, cabinet members like
former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, are invincible in Washington.
When citizens complained of watching their children groped by the TSA,
Napolitano defiantly retorted that if people did not want their children
groped, they should yield and use the unpopular full-body machines - the
machines being sold by her predecessor, Chertoff.
It is not just the Defense and DHS departments that enjoy the war windfall.
Take the Department of Justice (DOJ). A massive
counterterrorism system has been created employing tens of thousands of
personnel with billions of dollars to search for domestic terrorists.
The problem has been a comparative shortage of
actual terrorists to justify the size of this internal security system.
Accordingly, the DOJ has counted everything from simple immigration cases to
credit card fraud as terror cases in a body count approach not seen since
the Vietnam War.
For example, the DOJ claimed to have busted a
major terror-network as part of "Operation
Cedar Sweep", where Lebanese citizens were accused of sending
money to terrorists.
They were later forced to drop all charges
against all 27 defendants as unsupportable. It turned out to be a bunch of
simple head shops. Nevertheless, the new internal security system continues
to grind on with expanding powers and budgets.
A few years ago, the DOJ even changed the
definition of terrorism to allow for an ever-widening number of cases to be
considered "terror-related".
Symbiotic relationship
Our economic war-dependence is matched by political war-dependence.
Many members represent districts with
contractors that supply homeland security needs and our on-going wars.
Even with polls showing that the majority of Americans are opposed to
continuing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the new military-industrial
complex continues to easily muster the necessary support from both Democrats
and Republicans in Congress.
It is a testament to the influence of this
alliance that hundreds of billions are being spent in Afghanistan and Iraq
while Congress is planning to cut billions from core social programs,
including a possible rollback on Medicare due to lack of money.
None of that matters. It doesn't even matter
that Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called the U.S. 'the enemy'
and said he wishes that he had joined the Taliban.
Even the documented billions stolen by
government officials in Iraq and Afghanistan are treated as a mere cost
of doing business.
It is what Eisenhower described as the "misplaced power" of the
military-industrial complex - power that makes public opposition and even
thousands of dead soldiers immaterial.
War may be hell for some but it is heaven for
others in a war-dependent economy.
