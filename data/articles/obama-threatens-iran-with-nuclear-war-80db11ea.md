In his latest statements, President Obama has expressively warned Iran
against an imminent nuclear strike.
The surprising remarks by the politician
who snatched the Nobel Peace Prize for his conciliatory stance in recent
years, violated the UN Charter and astounded public opinion.
"The continued presence of all options on the table"; this is the
disappointing message which a Nobel Peace Prize laureate dispatches
internationally.
In his latest interview with CBS news, American President Barack Obama refused to rule out the possibility of a military strike
against Iran by harking back to the famous catchphrase of former U.S.
President
George W. Bush who once devised, regarding Iran's nuclear program,
the popular sentence of "all options are on the table".
Putting the quality and quantity of these options aside, the very "table" on
which the options should be placed is as well a matter of controversy.
-
Who
is in the position to decide the destiny of Iran's nuclear program?
-
Which
table is the U.S. President referring to?
-
What's wrong with Iran's nuclear
program in lieu of which a 70-million nation should go on with crippling
sanctions, continued threats of military strike, isolation and economic
embargo?
-
What's the definite answer to the simple question that "why should
the U.S., France and Israel possess nuclear weapons"?
-
Which one is more
offensive and violent?
-
Iran's nuclear program which has been demonstrated
again and again that does not have anything to do with military purposes, or
the adventurous, aggressive trajectory Washington and its European allies
have begun to go across?
Robert Parry, an award-winning American investigative journalist austerely
answers the questions we have in mind.
In an April 2 article in Consortium
News, he notes:
"if two countries with powerful nuclear arsenals were openly
musing about attacking a third country over mere suspicions that it might
want to join the nuclear club, we'd tend to sympathize with the non-nuclear
underdog as the victim of bullying and possible aggression."
As Robert Parry notes, the "bomb bomb Iran Parlor Game" has much to do with
the regular psychological operations the U.S. government ruthlessly directs
against its victims and it has been seen several times during the post-World
War II era that the U.S. government has resorted to the most brutal methods
of black propaganda to demonize and demoralize its opponents.
In order to thwart Iran's efforts to achieve the zeniths of high technology
and prevent the country from becoming an influential player in the Persian
Gulf region and beyond, Washington has mobilized a large number of
conservative think-tanks and pundits to direct psychological warfare against
Iran multilaterally.
Although the New York Times by itself suffices to wage
a spotless and perfect psy-op by running misleading and untruthful articles
which get circulated, syndicated and believed globally, numerous websites, blogs and community portals have also been activated to function as the
podium of White House so as to disseminate illusive and deceptive stories
regularly and misrepresent what's happening in Iran.
Over the past three decades and especially following the eruption of nuclear
dispute with Iran, U.S. has been carrying out media operations to incite
anti-Iranian sentiments vigorously. Some recent efforts include the
establishment of websites such as "United Against Nuclear Iran" and the
production of Hollywood-sponsored movies "300" and "The Wrestler".
The American psychological warfare, however, is not limited to
mainstream
media outlets, NY Times and Fox News-like stuff, campaign websites and TV
shows. A number of bloggers also have been mobilized to take part in the
cyber maneuver against Iran. It means that the wave of American
psychological operation against Iran has become so extensive and
far-reaching that even involves bloggers and independent commentators who
run e-zines and online publications.
Above all, carrying out psychological operations is one of the most
sensitive and delicate responsibilities of the U.S. Army, CIA's Special
Activities Division (SAD) and
National Clandestine Service (NCS).
SAD is in
charge of providing the U.S. President with "special" options where
diplomacy and military action is likely to fail. U.S. President has the
authority to order the commencement of a new clandestine operation whenever
necessary.
Covert and intangible intervention in foreign elections is one of
the main tasks of SAD. It also carries out missions to undermine or even
overthrow a regime which does not comply with the interests of the U.S.
administration.
SAD has a long history of carrying out inconceivable and
paralyzing missions of psychological propaganda against different countries
including:
-
Bolivia
-
Cuba
-
Vietnam
-
Laos
-
Nicaragua
-
El Salvador
-
Somalia
-
Iraq
-
Afghanistan
-
Iran
In Iran, where people still remember the bitter memory of U.S.-backed coup
d'etat of 1953 which brought down the democratic government of Dr. Mosaddeq
and inaugurated the tyranny of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, SAD has accomplished
numerous operations, several of which have been revealed by the
investigative journalists.
In July 2008, for example, the renowned American journalist Seymour Hersh
published an article in The New Yorker and revealed that the Bush
administration had taken practical steps, including the authorization of a
Presidential Finding to legitimize the illegal entry of paramilitary troops
into Iran, through the borders of Iraq, so as to help overthrow the
government of Iran.
Based on the documents he had obtained,
Hersh wrote:
"Late last year, Congress agreed to a request from President Bush to fund a
major escalation of covert operations against Iran. [...] These operations,
for which the President sought up to four hundred million dollars, were
described in a Presidential Finding signed by Bush, and are designed to
destabilize the countrys religious leadership."
Hersh cited the federal law of America which brands a Presidential Finding
as highly classified and only available to the Democratic and Republican
leaders in the House and the Senate and the ranking members of their
respective intelligence committees.
This greatly highlighted the
significance of his discovery of the documents.
"The Finding was focused on
undermining Iran's nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government
through regime change, working with opposition groups and passing money Hersh quoted an informed, anonymous source as saying.
SAD has also carried out globally significant actions such as preventing the
Italian Communist Party (PCI) from winning the parliamentary elections in
1948 and 1960s, overthrowing the government of Guatemala in 1954 and staging
the 1957 coup d'etat of Indonesia which removed from power the popular,
democratically-elected President Ahmad Sukarno and led to a terrible
massacre in which almost 1 million people lost their life.
Anyway, history seems to be repeated once again.
White House and its
numerous teams, departments, groups, unions and forces of psychological
operations, under the decree of someone who right after winning a Nobel
Prize of "Peace" began to drum for a war of bloodshed in the Middle East,
are gathering together to launch a new scenario of war games and violence.
However, they've simply forgotten an undeniable reality:
Iran is a different
country, different from all of the countries throughout the world.
