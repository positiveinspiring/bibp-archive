As witnessed recently by the Washington Post's horrifyingly dishonest "journalism" naming 200 independent media websites as pawns of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the dying establishment media is desperately trying to establish a news monopoly by discrediting all competing indy news publishers.
In doing so, the Washington Post (and its writer Craig Timberg) just abandoned any last vestige of journalistic credibility.
Now owned by Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, the Washington Post's willingness to prostitute its own credibility in an effort to destroy the independent media reveals something startling to the world:
They're desperate.
Like a cornered, ravenous animal, the mainstream media is now fighting for its very survival and hoping it can eliminate all news alternatives before the public figures out how deeply they've been lying all long.
That description also applies to the globalists - nefarious manipulators of finance, technology and culture in order to achieve their selfish aims of world domination and depopulation.
Following the BREXIT vote, the election of Donald Trump and the ending of the Renzi regime in Italy, the globalists are in full panic mode to regain control by eliminating every sector of freedom still remaining on our planet.
It's all happening right now, day by day, played out in the pages of the New York Times.
Here are the key areas where globalists have declared war on humanity (each is covered in more detail below):
The war on cash (freedom of commerce) The war on automobiles (i.e. freedom of travel) The war on the Internet (freedom of expression) The war on dissenting literature and news (freedom of information)
The war on cash (freedom of commerce)
The war on automobiles (i.e. freedom of travel)
The war on the Internet (freedom of expression)
The war on dissenting literature and news (freedom of information)
There's also, of course, the war on your health, but that topic is so enormous it will have to covered in a separate article.
The war on cash is well underway, and the massive debt collapse now being engineered by the globalists will be exploited to abandon (outlaw) all cash and force people into electronic currencies.
Why the war on cash? Because cash offers too much freedom and anonymity to the very people the State wishes to control.
The electronic currency promoted by the globalists will have the following characteristics:
All transactions will be tracked by the government. It will be the end of anonymity unless you're using Bitcoin or a similar crypto-currency, all of which will of course be criminalized by the State. All money can be frozen or confiscated by the government for any reason, including completely fabricated accusations such as "you are working for the Russians." This gives the government absolute power to confiscate wealth, punish dissenters, put targeted commercial operations out of business, or even hand out endless currency to its crony corporate friends in Washington. Confiscatory taxes can be automatically extracted from all your earnings, savings and transactions, without your consent or knowledge. This means governments no longer have to rely on you to "report" your earnings to the IRS. They can simply confiscate a percentage of all your earnings and expenditures according to whatever rates and schedules they desire. Savings and deposits can be subjected to negative interest rates without causing a run on cash withdrawals. Negative interest rates are a key tactic that will be employed by globalist banksters and corrupt governments that incessantly seek new, innovative ways to steal productivity from the fiscally illiterate masses. Once a government spends its way to debt oblivion, it can simply announce a massive nationwide "bail in" that confiscated all the electronic currency and issues a new electronic currency worth much less, all at the click of a button. This "wholesale confiscation" of economic productivity from the working class can keep government debt spending and money printing spinning for generations in a kind of e-currency perpetual motion machine.

The NYT, WashPost, CNN and all the usual presstitute globalists are already pushing bans of $100 bills for this very reason.
Their goal is the criminalization of cash as step one in their push for a global totalitarian police state.
As SilverDoctors.com explains, negative interest rates are desperately needed by globalist banksters to thoroughly screw the world's workers out of their earnings:
What's really behind this? Why is there such a big movement to ban something that is used for felonious purposes by just a fraction of a percent of the population? Cash, it turns out, is the Achilles' Heel of the financial system. Central banks around the world have kept interest rates at near-zero levels for nearly eight years now. And despite having created massive bubbles and enabled extraordinary amounts of debt, their policies aren't working. Especially in Europe, the hope of stoking economic growth (and even the sickening goal of inflation) has failed. So naturally, since what they've been trying hasn't worked, their response is to continue trying the same thing and more of it. Interest rates across the European continent are now negative. Japanese interest rates are now negative. And even in the United States, the Federal Reserve has acknowledged that negative interest rates are being considered. They have no other choice; raising rates will bankrupt the governments they support and derail any fledgling economic growth. Look at how low interest rates are in the US - and yet 4th quarter GDP practically ground to a halt. They simply cannot afford to raise rates. As global economic weakness continues to play out, central banks will have no other option but to take interest rates even further into negative territory. That said, negative interest rates will be the destruction of the financial system.

Because an automobile allows a person to travel almost anywhere they wish - without government tracking or permission - automobiles are being targeted for replacement by "driverless" vehicles and a push for mass transit.
Both driverless vehicles and mass transit systems offer governments and globalists an easy way to track the movements of individuals in society. Revisit the Tom Cruise feature film Minority Report to understand the implications of all this it essentially means the end of personal freedom.
Just this week, car manufacturer BMW managed to remotely lock a thief inside the car he was stealing, turning an automobile into a temporary prison.
While we might all cheer the application of this technology to catch thieves, the far greater realization is that corrupt governments may consider any dissenting citizen to be a criminal.
If you disagree with the government's position on vaccine mandates, GMO labeling, fiat currency or the terrorizing of North Dakota Native Americans to build an oil pipeline, for example, you might be designated a "domestic terrorist" and locked in your own vehicle by order of the State.
From there, the automobile might easily be directed to transport you to an awaiting jail cell, interrogation room or reeducation camp.
Don't think it could happen?
According to Autoblog.com:
A newly married man discovered his BMW 550i was missing last Sunday, the day after his wedding. The man called the theft into Seattle police, who contacted BMW. Employees at BMW's corporate headquarters were able to give officers the exact location of the car and were able to remotely lock the 550i, trapping the suspect.

This report reveals that not only can corporations and governments track the exact location of your vehicle at any moment, they can also remotely disable the vehicle or turn it into a human prison cell.
Consider the implications of that the next time you're shopping for a new car that comes with remote security "features."
The push for mass transit, by the way, also allows governments to corral citizens through "security checkpoints" where facial recognition systems scan thousands of faces a minute, comparing them to government database of "wanted" individuals.
You can be placed on a "wanted" list just as easily as I was recently placed on a list cited by the Washington Post, ridiculously accusing me of working as a propaganda operative for Vladamir Putin.
The Washington Post, doubling down on its commitment to false reporting, has so far refused to retract it's obviously fictional article.
Such "lists," in other words, can be completely fabricated out of thin air, yet cited as "authoritative" by any corrupt corporation or government that seeks to silence, intimidate or eliminate political opposition.
Technology such as driverless vehicles will obviously be leveraged to control humanity, not to set it free.
Google Facebook Twitter Yahoo News
For years, nearly all independent media organizations - the only real "free press" in the western world - have been banned from Google News and Yahoo News.
Now, Google is blacklisting independent media websites from its Adsense program as a tactic to deny revenues to websites that publish information the left-leaning Google high priests don't want anyone to read.
Facebook, too, has announced a new strategy to highlight "hand-picked" news publishers such as,
CNN MSNBC NYT Washington Post,
CNN
MSNBC
NYT
Washington Post,
...and others that knowingly, deliberately and maliciously fabricate fake news.
In doing this, Facebook has decided to diminish and suppress independent media news websites, effectively driving their visibility into the margins of public consciousness.
Twitter, similarly, has already threatened to ban Donald Trump's account if he gets out of line, and Yahoo News has systematically removed nearly all conservative news websites from its index, reinforcing the "liberal bubble" of delusional leftist news for its already deluded followers.
The aim of all this, of course, is to eliminate dissenting views altogether. It's not about "winning" any debate; it's about silencing those with whom the left-wing tech giants disagree.
This demonstrates the extreme, belligerent intolerance of the radical left:
They have no tolerance whatsoever for views, opinions or even scientific evidence that contradicts their own twisted beliefs (which are often rooted in delusional paranoia as we've recently seen with their "Russian conspiracy" freakout).
The war on the internet also involves turning over domain name authority to globalist info-dictators.
President Obama recently pushed hard to surrender the domain name authority ICANN to international control, placing it under the iron fist of China's communist leaders.
This is all by design, of course:
International bodies can seize domain names or shut down DNS for targeted websites, completely free from domestic legal action.
If these internet tyrants wish to silence a website like NaturalNews.com, they simply fabricate any accusation they want, then cite that accusation to seize the domain name via ICANN.
Suddenly, the entire website gets "memory holed" or replaced with whatever propaganda the globalists want to push.
Radical leftists and globalists don't merely want to silence opposing websites and monopolize the news; they also want to eliminate "offensive" books and literature from society.
This effort, of course, involves all sorts of book burning initiatives disguised as "inclusiveness" or "tolerance."
Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn book has already been targeted for elimination from human history due to its historically authentic use of racial terminology.
For similar reasons, the Harper Lee book To Kill a Mockingbird has also been targeted for removal from libraries.
The justification, as always, is that the book contains "offensive" content - a wishy-washy accusation rooted in astonishing ignorance yet strongly upheld by the intolerant left as justification for burning whatever books they currently find "offensive." (A slippery slope of totalitarian revisionist history if there ever was one )
To get a sense of where all this is headed, watch the 2002 film Equilibrium, starring Christian Bale.
The film paints a remarkably authentic picture of an intolerant, militant society banning art, literature, religion and even emotion. In essence, Equilibrium depicts what would happen if the radical leftist agenda of "safe spaces" were fast-forwarded another 20 years.
In that dystopian future, collectors of art and literature are condemned as enemies of the state and executed on sight. (This is precisely how the radical left now views religious conservatives in America.)
Globalist bloodline researcher David Icke is fond of saying that even people who consider themselves to be "truth seekers" nevertheless have limits of what they are willing to embrace as truth.
I've also found this to be quite true, and it is with that realization firmly in mind that I'm going to share with you the final end game of all this:
It is the elimination of 90% of the human population...
Globalists don't merely wish to control billions of sheeple, you see. They ultimately want to eliminate them.
Totalitarian control is simply one tactic toward that final aim. Right now, billions of people won't yet be eliminated because autonomous robots can't yet replace human labor.
But that day is rapidly approaching, and the minute it arrives, the "great culling" will begin.
Do you seriously think the globalists' future needs low-wage, low-income, low-utility humans hanging around, consuming the planet's resources and disrupting the globalists' plans with ballot box votes that can't be entirely manipulated?
No, the future doesn't need you at all... We are all expendable in the minds of the globalists.
Globalists hold deep hatred for humanity, you see. Because they despise humanity as a whole, they also hate the individual members of it.
This is why they hold such animosity toward,
liberty individual preparedness self-reliance
liberty
individual preparedness
self-reliance
It's the common thread behind everything they oppose:
vaccine choice home schooling the Second Amendment independent media off-grid living even scientific truth
vaccine choice
home schooling
the Second Amendment
independent media
off-grid living
even scientific truth
My final warning is that you are not really prepared for what's coming until you realize the globalists have declared war on humanity...
You, as a free-thinking individual, are the enemy of the globalists. They are working overtime to either control you or destroy you. There is no room in their long-term plans for any individual who thinks critically and questions the status quo.
The only humans they are willing to tolerate are obedient workers and even those only for another generation or so. For now, they demand your obedience. Once they have it, they will demand your silence as the culling begins.
Before long, they will demand your head.
This is the plan they have already set into motion, and this plan of monumental genocide is being meticulously set up by,
Google Facebook the Washington Post,
Google
Facebook
the Washington Post,
...and truly evil destroyers of life like,
Jeff Bezos Bill Gates George Soros
Jeff Bezos
Bill Gates
George Soros
Until you realize this, you have no chance to overcome it.
Only those willing to accept the full reality of the globalist assault on humanity have a shot at defeating that demonic agenda and halting the mass genocide planned for us all. The Holocaust of history is nothing compared to the Holocaust they have planned for humanity.
In WWII, a reported six million Jews were exterminated.
Multiply that by one thousand and you now have the scale of the next depopulation holocaust planned for us all:
More than six BILLION people are scheduled to be exterminated.
And they surely don't want those who are on the schedule to be exterminated figuring out all this before the culling begins.
