Hillary & Obama In Secret Bilderberg
Rendezvous
by Paul Joseph Watson

PrisonPlanet Website
According to news reports, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton
went out of their way to hold their long-awaited private meeting in a very
specific location - not at Hillary's mansion in Washington - but in Northern
Virginia, which also just happens to be the scene of the 2008 Bilderberg
meeting.
Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs told the media that Obama and Clinton
held a private meeting last night but he refused to disclose where it taken
place, except that it was not at Clinton's home in Washington, as had been
widely reported.
Hillary campaign managers also refused to
disclose the location of the rendezvous.
"Reporters traveling with Obama sensed
something might be happening between the pair when they arrived at
Dulles International Airport after an event in Northern Virginia and
Obama was not aboard the airplane," reports the Associated Press.
Dulles just happens to be walking distance from
the Westfields Marriott hotel in Chantilly where Henry Kissinger, David
Rockefeller and the rest of the Bilderberg globalists are convening.
"Asked at the time about the Illinois
senator's whereabouts, Gibbs smiled and declined to comment," the
reports adds.
What is the only political "event" taking place
in Northern Virginia at the moment?
The Bilderberg Group meeting of course. Rather
than taking the easier option of meeting at Clinton's Washington mansion,
Obama and Hillary went out of their way to grace the Bilderberg elitists
with their presence.
The neo-liberal website Wonkette, which had previously ridiculed "conspiracy
theorists" for ascribing power to Bilderberg, seemed to take a somewhat
different tone when it made the connection between Obama and Hillary's
meeting and the Bilderberg Group.
"Guess who had a very private talky-talk in
(maybe) romantic Northern Virginia tonight, probably at the Bilderberg
Group meeting in Chantilly? Your Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton!,"
states the blog.
"They really met and talked, in private,
Thursday night. And really, it sounds like they did this at that creepy
Bilderberg Group meeting, which is happening now, and which is so secret
that nobody will admit theyre going, even though everybody who is
anybody goes to Bilderberg."
To have the potential future President and
Vice-President of America attend a conference that debunkers have dismissed
as a mere talking shop for old white men once again underscores the real
influence that Bilderberg enjoys.
Not one U.S. corporate media outlet has made the connection between the
location of the Bilderberg Group conference this year and Obama and
Hillary's decision to venture out to Chantilly for their confidential "tet a
tet".
Not one U.S. corporate media outlet has yet uttered one word about 125 of
the world's most influential power brokers meeting behind closed doors to
discuss the future of the planet on U.S. soil - while being met by the
probable future President of the United States.
Both Hillary and Obama have deep rooted connections to the Bilderberg
elitists.
Bill Clinton attended the 1991 meeting in Germany shortly before becoming
President and he attended again in 1999 when the conference was held in
Sintra, Portugal (despite Clinton's lie that he had not attended in 15
years).
Hillary herself was rumored to have attended the 2006 meeting in Ottawa,
Canada.
As we reported last month, Bilderberg luminary and top corporate elitist
James A. Johnson will select Democratic candidate Barack Obama's running
mate for the 2008 election and in turn potentially act as kingmaker for
America's future President.
Johnson also selected John Kerry's running mate John Edwards in 2004 after
Edwards had impressed Bilderberg elitists Henry Kissinger and
David Rockefeller with a speech he gave at
the globalist confab in Italy that year.
Johnson, who attended last year's Bilderberg meeting in Turkey, is a
representative for Friends of Bilderberg, an offshoot group that
organizes Bilderberg's annual meeting.
Hillary and Obama's attendance of the 2008 Bilderberg meeting, and the
complete failure of the mainstream media to report on the fact, once again
betrays the super-secretive nature and influential reputation that the
54-year-old organization still maintains.
Barack OBilderberg - Picking the President

GlobalResearch Website
A Background to Bilderberg
Sunday, June 8, 2008, marked the last
day of this years annual Bilderberg meeting, which took place in Chantilly,
Virginia.
The American Friends of Bilderberg, an American
Bilderberg front group, which organizes the American participant list for
the annual Bilderberg conference, issued a rare press release this year.
It stated that,
"The Conference will deal mainly with a
nuclear free world, cyber terrorism, Africa, Russia, finance,
protectionism, US-EU relations, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Islam and
Iran. Approximately 140 participants will attend." 1
Bilderberg, which has been meeting annually
since 1954, is a highly secretive international think tank and some say,
policy-forming group made up of representatives from North America and
Western Europe and was founded by Joseph Retinger,
Prince Bernhard
of the Netherlands and Belgian Prime Minister Paul Van Zeeland.
The Bilderberg Steering Committee, made
up of around 30 people, (with no official list available),
"decided that it would invite 100 of the
most powerful people in Europe and North America every year to meet
behind closed doors at a different five-star resort. The group stresses
secrecy: What's said at a Bilderberg conference stays at a Bilderberg
conference." 2
Usually, the Bilderberg Conference is
held in Europe for three years in a row, with the fourth year holding a
meeting in North America. However, the previous North American conference
was held in 2006 in Ottawa. So why did they break tradition to hold the
conference in North America this year?
Speculation abounds around a discussion of a
possible
attack on Iran, the American-centered global financial crisis, as
well as the current US Presidential elections.
First Meeting of the
Bilderberg in 1954
Prince Bernhard presides the
Conference
Bilderberg has long been an important forum for
up-and-coming politicians of Western nations to be introduced to the
global financial elite:
-
the heads of the major
-
multinational corporations
-
international banks
-
world financial institutions
-
global governing bodies
-
think tanks
-
powerful individuals of the likes of:
-
various European monarchs, including,
-
Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands,
daughter of founding member, Prince Bernhard
-
Queen Sofia and King Juan Carlos of
Spain
According to The Globe and Mail, such
Canadian Prime Ministers have, in the past, (often before becoming Prime
Minister), attended a Bilderberg Conference as a guest, including:
-
Pierre Trudeau
-
Jean Chretien
-
Paul Martin
-
Stephen Harper 3
Tony Blair attended Bilderberg before
becoming Prime Minister,4 as did the current British Prime
Minister, Gordon Brown, who also recently called for the establishment of a
"new world order." 5
Interestingly, as the Washington Post reported, Vernon E. Jordon,
a high-powered American executive, who sits on several corporate boards,
including American Express, Xerox, J.C. Penney, Dow Jones, and Sara Lee, to
name a few, also happens to be a very close friend of former President
Bill Clinton.
However,
"it was Jordan who first introduced
then-Gov. Clinton to world leaders at their annual Bilderberg gathering
in Germany in 1991. Plenty of governors try to make that scene; only
Clinton got taken seriously at that meeting, because Vernon Jordan said
he was okay." 6
Clinton subsequently became President.
Barack and Bilderberg
Recently, there has been much discussion about Barack Obama having
possibly attended the recent Bilderberg conference in Virginia.
This speculation arose when Barack Obama and
Hillary Clinton sneaked off for a secretive meeting while in Virginia.
As the AP reported,
"Reporters traveling with Obama sensed
something might be happening between the pair when they arrived at
Dulles International Airport after an event in Northern Virginia and
Obama was not aboard the airplane. Asked at the time about the Illinois
senator's whereabouts, [Obama spokesman Robert] Gibbs smiled and
declined to comment." 7
The press that had been traveling with Obama
were not made aware of the secretive meeting until the plane that they
assumed Obama would be present on was moving down the runway, prompting many
angry questions from the press towards Obamas spokesman, Robert Gibbs.
One reported asked Gibbs,
"Why were we not told about this meeting
until we were on the plane, the doors were shut and the plane was about
to taxi to take off?" to which he responded, "Senator Obama had a desire
to do some meetings, others had a desire to meet with him tonight in a
private way and that is what we are doing."
This preceded another question,
"Is there more than one meeting, is there
more than one person with whom he is meeting?" Gibbs simply replied, "I
am not going to get into all the details of the meeting."
He again later repeated that,
"There was a desire to do some meetings
tonight, he was interested in doing them, others were interested in
doing them, and to do them in a way that was private." 8
On Friday, June 6, it was reported that
Bilderberg tracker, Jim Tucker,
"called Obamas office today to ask if he
had attended Bilderberg. A campaign spokeswoman refused to discuss the
matter but would not deny that Obama had attended Bilderberg." 9
Bilderberg to Pick Obamas Vice President
As the Financial Times reported in May of this year, Barack Obama
appointed James A. Johnson, the former CEO of Fannie Mae,
"to head a secret committee to produce a
shortlist for his vice-presidential running mate."
A short list was discussed by the article, which
listed, other than Hillary Clinton,
"Jim Webb, the former secretary of the navy,
Vietnam veteran and senator for Virginia; Tim Kaine, the governor of
Virginia; John Edwards, the former vice-presidential candidate in 2004;
Ted Strickland, the governor of Ohio; and Kathleen Sebelius, the
governor of Kansas."
Other potential nominees include,
"Sam Nunn, the former chairman of the Senate
armed services committee; and Wesley Clark, the former head of NATO in
Europe." 10
James A. Johnson, the man Obama asked to
pick his running mate, played the same role for John Kerry back in 2004, and
he selected John Edwards.
As the New York Times reported,
"Several people pointed to the secretive and
exclusive Bilderberg conference of some 120 people that this year drew
the likes of Henry A. Kissinger, Melinda Gates and Richard A. Perle to
Stresa, Italy, in early June, as helping [Edwards] win Mr. Kerry's
heart. Mr. Edwards spoke so well in a debate on American politics with
the Republican Ralph Reed that participants broke Bilderberg rules to
clap before the end of the session."
The Times further reported,
"His performance at Bilderberg was
important,'' said a friend of Mr. Kerry who was there.
''He reported back directly to Kerry. There
were other reports on his performance. Whether they reported directly or
indirectly, I have no doubt the word got back to Mr. Kerry about how
well he did." 11
James A. Johnson, Vice Chairman of Perseus, a
merchant banking firm, is also a director of Goldman Sachs, Forestar Real
Estate Group, Inc., KB Home, Target Corporation and UnitedHealth Group Inc.,
is also a member of the American Friends of Bilderberg, the Council on
Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission and is an honorary trustee of
the Brookings Institution.12
It is likely that Obamas running mate will be
chosen by Johnson at this years Bilderberg Conference.
Notable among this years Bilderberg guests are Kansas Governor, Kathleen
Sebelius, who the Financial Times reported was on Johnsons short
list of nominees. In fact, Sebelius is the only person mentioned as a
possible running mate in the Financial Times article that was officially
listed on the Bilderberg list of attendees.13
Could this be a sign that she may be the chosen
one? Time will tell.
However, another Democratic politician present
at the meeting was Tom Daschle, so perhaps he is working his way back into
politics.
Dont Forget McCain
Just because Obamas popularity dwarfs that of McCains, is not reason
enough to ignore the other candidate.
After all, the elite never ignore both
candidates, and in fact, ensure they have them both neatly packed in their
back pockets. Among the guests at the Bilderberg meeting this year, included
Republican Governor of South Carolina, Mark Sanford, as well as Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice,14 which would be a smart political pick for McCain,
going up against the first black presidential candidate.
McCain has also received endorsements from former Secretaries of State,
Henry Kissinger, General Alexander Haig, Lawrence Eagleburger
and George P. Shultz.15 These are not men without
influence, as Henry Kissinger and George Shultz were also present at this
years meeting.16
Also interesting to note is that George P.
Shultz,
"associated himself with the Bush presidency
early on, introducing the Texas governor to Condoleezza Rice at the
Hoover Institution in 1998."
Could Condi be in the process of being groomed
for higher office, or is she simply at the meeting for foreign policy
discussions?
Also important to note, is that McCain had a fundraiser in London held for
him, which was hosted,
"by kind permission of Lord Rothschild OM
GBE [Order of Merit and the Knight Grand Cross of the British Empire]
and the Hon Nathaniel Rothschild."
As the Washington Post reported,
"Tickets to the invitation-only event cost
$1,000 to $2,300." 18
The Post later reported,
"Aides refused to talk about the fundraiser,
or to say how much money was raised, and McCain dashed through the rain
away from reporters after emerging. One guest said there were about 100
people at the luncheon. If they all gave the maximum, the event would
have raised about $230,000 for the campaign." 19
