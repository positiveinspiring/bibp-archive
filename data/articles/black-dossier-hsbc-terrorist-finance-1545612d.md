It's tough being the world's second largest bank.
HSBC, the London-based British multinational banking and
financial services giant operates in 85 countries with 7,200
offices worldwide with assets totaling more than $2.6
trillion (£4.06tn).
They're also caught-up in serial scandals:
Founded in 1865 when
the British Crown seized Hong Kong as a
colony in the aftermath of
the First Opium War, British
merchants (today we'd call them drug lords) needed a bank to
handle the brisk trade in the illicit substance and launched
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Company Limited.
Rebranded
"HSBC" in 1991, the bank expanded at breakneck speed in the
heady days after The Wall fell.
While some might call them a success story, exemplars of
financial wizardry in tough economic times, more
appropriately perhaps, we might borrow a term from Mafia
lore to describe their preeminent position in the capitalist
pantheon of corrupt institutions:
juiced.
'Sorry, now Go Away'
Today, the "War on Drugs" rivals the "War on Terror" for top
spot on the global hypocrisy index.
Moral equivalencies abound. After all, when American secret
state agencies manage
drug flows or direct
terrorist proxies to attack official enemies it's not
quite the same as
battling terror or crime.
Pounding home that point, a new report by the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accused HSBC of
exposing "the U.S. financial system to a wide array of money
laundering, drug trafficking, and terrorist financing risks
due to poor anti-money laundering (AML) controls."
That 335-page report, "U.S. Vulnerabilities to Money
Laundering, Drugs, and Terrorist Financing: HSBC Case
History," was issued after a year-long Senate investigation
zeroed-in on the bank's U.S. affiliate, HSBC Bank USA, N.A.,
better known as HBUS.
Drilling down, we learned that amongst the "services"
offered by HSBC subsidiaries and correspondent banks were,
-
sweet deals with financial entities with terrorist ties
-
the
transportation of billions of dollars in cash by plane and
armored car through their London Banknotes division
-
the
clearing of sequentially-numbered travelers checks through
dodgy Cayman Islands accounts for Mexican drug lords and
Russian mafiosi
From richly-appointed suites at Canary Wharf, London, the
bank's "smartest guys in the room" handed some of the most
violent gangsters on earth the financial wherewithal to
organize their respective industries: global crime.
A case in point. In 2008 alone the Senate revealed that the
bank's Cayman Islands branch handled some 50,000 client
accounts (all without benefit of offices or staff on Grand
Cayman, mind you), yet
still managed to ship some $7 billion (£10.9bn) in
cash from Mexico into the U.S. Now
that's creative
accounting!
Playing fast and loose with U.S. banking rules, Subcommittee
Chairman Carl Levin (D-MI)
said that by exploiting the bank's "poor AML controls,
HBUS exposed the United States to Mexican drug money,
suspicious travelers cheques, bearer share corporations, and
rogue jurisdictions."
Describing a,
"compliance culture" that was "pervasively
polluted for a long time," Levin said it "will take more
than words for the bank to change course."
Yet weasel words and butt-covering were all that were
proffered to the American people even before Senate hearings
began.
Bank spokesman Robert Sherman said in an emailed
statement that HSBC,
"will acknowledge that, in the past, we
have sometimes failed to meet the standards that regulators
and customers expect. We will apologize, acknowledge these
mistakes, answer for our actions and give our absolute
commitment to fixing what went wrong."
Right on cue, chief compliance officer
David Bagley
dramatically fell on his sword during those hearings and
resigned on camera. It was quite a performance even by
Washington's tawdry standards.
Appearing contrite, Bagley told the panel:
"Despite the best
efforts and intentions of many dedicated professionals, HSBC
has fallen short of our own expectations and the
expectations of our regulators. ... I recommended to the
group that now is the appropriate time for me and for the
bank, for someone new to serve as the head of group
compliance."
While there's no word yet just how big Bagley's golden
parachute will be, it's a sure bet he won't spend a day in
jail, nor for that matter will Lord Stephen Green, HSBC's
former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Between 2003-2010, Green tilled the helm after serial stints
directing,
...units which feature prominently in the
scandal. Sensing perhaps that the jig was up, last year he
joined David Cameron's Conservative government as Minister
of State for Trade and Investment.
Unlike Pappy Bush who claimed to be "out of the loop" during
the Iran-Contra guns-for-drugs affair, Green was fully
apprised of bank shenanigans and the Senate published emails
which prove it.
Cheekily however, while underlings take the fall, Green told
The Daily Telegraph,
"I do not believe that I
have a case to answer other than in the important sense that
as chairman and chief executive I was responsible for what
the company did. HSBC has expressed regret for the failures.
I share that regret."
The Telegraph noted
that Green has not considered resigning from Cameron's
government, saying he was "very engaged" with his current
plum post.
Ironically enough, the current Baron of Hurstpierpoint is an
ordained priest in the Church of England and the author of
an inspirational tome, Good
Value: Reflections on Money, Morality and an Uncertain World.
And no, you can't make this stuff up!
The top spot is now occupied by Stuart Gulliver who, quicker
than you can say "we're sorry," admonished employees to "do
better" and expressed remorse over his firm's "unacceptable
behavior."
Never mind that before ascending the throne,
Gulliver was director of HBUS, HSBC Latin American Holdings
Ltd., and HSBC Bank Middle East Ltd., divisions that have
raised more than an eyebrow or two amongst Subcommittee
investigators.
Topping Bagley's Kabuki-lite performance with her own
rendition of clown car camp, Irene Dorner, HBUS's President
and CEO told the Senate:
"We deeply regret and apologize for
the fact that HSBC did not live up to the expectations of
our regulators, our customers, our employees, and the
general public. HSBC's compliance history, as examined
today, is unacceptable...
We've worked hard to foster a
new culture that values and rewards effective compliance,
and that starts at the top."
Bathos aside, it was a polite way of saying "let's move on"
and get back to the business of lining our pockets; after
all, it's what we do best.
'The past is never dead.
It's not even past'
Years before hijackers slammed passenger planes into the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon killing nearly 3,000
people, secret state agencies began to exploit the fraternal
links between Osama bin Laden's Afghan-Arab database of
disposable Western intelligence assets, also known as al
Qaeda, and prominent financial institutions.
In his 1999 book,
Dollars
for Terror, journalist Richard Labévière relates
how a former CIA analyst explained:
"The policy of guiding
the evolution of Islam and helping them against our
adversaries worked marvelously well in Afghanistan against
the Red Army. The same doctrines can still be used to
destabilize what remains of Russian power, and especially to
counter the Chinese influence in Central Asia."
Was a new Cold War
dawning?
No. In fact, it was the
same Cold War. Only this time it was tricked-out in
seductive finery by denizens of Western think-tanks and
on-the-make NGOs.
In the age of spin and endless news
cycles, they'd hit upon a splendid formula to pour the "old"
imperialist wine into new bottles:
"humanitarian
intervention" and a "responsibility to protect."
It was a brilliant script. In the blink of an eye our media-savvy
masters could "enhance democracy" and "reform markets,"
magically transforming
publicly-owned resources into
privately-held
assets controlled by banks!
That terrorist proxies would
serve as walk-ons and help drive the final nail into the
coffin of national sovereignty wasn't considered proper
conversation in polite company.
Labévière wondered whether,
"the new forms of terrorism
actually embody the highest stage of capitalism?"
They did,
and,
"the straw men of the bin Laden Organization's
subsidiaries [were] very well received by the business
lawyers of Wall Street and the Bahamas, by the wealth
managers of Geneva, Zurich and Lugano, and in the hushed
salons of the City of London."
Not so curiously perhaps,
"the privatization of violence and
the privatization of the economy has become paradigmatic."
In fact, "apart from any religious purpose," Labévière
wrote,
"the 'Jihad' is gaining ground as a profitable
activity. It becomes liable to all the mafioso devolutions,
and sinks into pure banditry. In many cases, Islamist
ideology is used as a wonder worker to paper over banditry
in all its forms."
Bin Laden as a Mafia capo
di tutti capi? It certainly was a novel reading of
geopolitical machinations!
More to the point, if an "army marches on its stomach," who
then are the money men who put food in their bellies and
kalashnikovs in their hands?
Bankrolled by Saudi and Gulf banks with a wink, a nod and
logistical support from their old friends, the CIA and the
Pentagon, today's Green
condottieri once again are on the march, wrecking
havoc and sowing chaos, with particular attention paid to
states targeted as official enemies by the Global Godfather.
Just ask the Iraqis, Libyans and Syrians.
While the Senate report may have disclosed that HSBC turned
a blind eye to terrorist financing among it correspondent
banks, the Riyadh-based Al Rajhi Bank for one, Saudi
Arabia's largest privately-held financial institution, such
arrangements hardly flourished in a vacuum.
With assets totaling $59 billion (£92.5bn), the Al Rajhi's
are amongst the wealthiest families in the Kingdom.
Investigators found that after 9/11,
"evidence began to
emerge that Al Rajhi Bank and some of its owners had links
to organizations associated with financing terrorism,
including that one of the bank's founders was an early
financial benefactor of al Qaeda."
While the Al Rajhi family deny any role in financing
terrorism, they have declined,
"to address specific
allegations made in American intelligence and
law-enforcement records, citing client confidentiality,"
The Wall Street Journal reported back in 2007.
Journalist Glenn R. Simpson averred that,
"a 2003 CIA report
claims that a year after Sept. 11, with a spotlight on
Islamic charities, Mr. Al Rajhi ordered Al Rajhi Bank's
board 'to explore financial instruments that would allow the
bank's charitable contributions to avoid official Saudi
scrutiny'."
"A few weeks earlier," the
Journal disclosed, the Agency said that "Mr. Al Rajhi
'transferred $1.1 billion to offshore accounts - using
commodity swaps and two Lebanese banks - citing a concern
that U.S. and Saudi authorities might freeze his assets.'
The report was titled 'Al Rajhi Bank: Conduit for Extremist
Finance'."
Although U.S. law enforcement and secret state agencies,
"acknowledge it is possible that extremists use the bank's
far-flung branches and money-transfer services without bank
officials' knowledge," the
Journal noted that CIA analysts had concluded that
"senior Al Rajhi family members have long supported Islamic
extremists and probably know that terrorists use their
bank."
It goes without saying that one should always approach CIA
reports with a healthy dose of skepticism, especially in
light of the Agency's well-documented history of employing
cut-outs such as al Qaeda as terrorist cats' paws.
Such reports however, lay a trail of bread crumbs that
policy makers can either act upon or more likely, ignore.
That senior
Bush and
Obama administration officials did
nothing with this information, never mind the regulatory
agencies charged to enforce anti-money laundering laws, is
testament to the corrupt,
bipartisan nature of American policy as a whole.
It also beggars belief that Lord Green or the bank's
compliance officers were unaware of CIA allegations or that
Britain's own foreign intelligence arm, MI6, hadn't apprised
top officials of the risks involved. In fact, as we'll see
below, HSBC's own internal documents prove otherwise.
Osama's 'Golden Chain'
There were certainly plenty of red flags flying which should
have alerted bank officials.
In March 2002, al Qaeda's list of financial benefactors
surfaced when computers were seized in Sarajevo at the
Bosnian headquarters of the Benevolence International
Foundation, "a Saudi based nonprofit organization which was
also designated a terrorist organization by the Treasury
Department."
Osama bin Laden, who held a Bosnian passport issued by the
breakaway government fronted by Western "liberal
interventionist" darling Alija Izetbegović during NATO's
dismemberment of socialist Yugoslavia, was a supporter of
the Nazi SS Handschar
Division during World War II. Bin Laden referred to this
group of financial angels as his "Golden Chain."
Additional evidence also emerged in 2002 during
Operation
Green Quest, a Treasury Department effort to,
"disrupt
terrorist financing in the United States."
In March of that year, law enforcement officials raided the
Herndon, Virginia offices of the SAAR Foundation "an Al
Rajhi-related entity."
Indeed, the name "SAAR" was an
acronym for the organization's founder, Sulaiman Abdul Aziz
Al Rajhi, the controlling partner of the Al Rajhi Bank.
Subcommittee investigators commented that,
"one of the 20
handwritten names in the Golden Chain document identifying
al Qaeda's early key financial benefactors is Sulaiman bin
Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi, one of Al Rajhi Bank's key founders and
most senior officials."
An affidavit supporting the search warrants,
"detailed
numerous connections between the targeted entities and Al Rajhi family members and related ventures. The affidavit
stated that over 100 active and defunct nonprofit and
business ventures in Virginia were part of what it described
as the 'Safa Group,' which the United States had reasonable
cause to believe was 'engaged in the money laundering tactic
of 'layering' to hide from law enforcement authorities the
trail of its support for terrorists."
Green Quest investigators were particularly keen on
unraveling links between the SAAR Foundation and the Swiss
Al Taqwa Bank, incorporated in the Bahamas in 1988 for "tax
purposes."
Founded by Swiss Nazi sympathizer and convert to Islam,
Albert Armand (Achmed) Huber, who professed admiration for
both Adolph Hitler and Osama bin Laden, the bank was accused
by U.S. officials in helping al Qaeda launder funds.
Although the Treasury Department froze its assets in 2001,
the investigation was shut down by the Bush administration
before deeper linkages could be fully uncovered.
In 2011, a lawsuit was filed by insurance giant Lloyd's of
London against Saudi Arabia which sought to recover pay outs
to victims of the 9/11 attacks.
The suit noted,
"that two
individuals who were former executives at Bank al Taqwa,
Ibrahim Hassabella and Samir Salah, were also associated
with the SAAR Foundation."
At the time,
The Independent reported that the legal claim
suggested that defendants,
"'knowingly' provided resources,
including funding, to al-Qa'ida in the years before the
attack and encouraged anti-Western sentiment which increased
support for the terror group."
According to court briefs,
"Absent the sponsorship of al-Qa'ida's
material sponsors and supporters, including the defendants
named therein, al-Qa'ida would not have possessed the
capacity to conceive, plan and execute the 11 September
attacks.
The success of al-Qa'ida's agenda, including the 11
September attacks themselves, has been made possible by the
lavish sponsorship al-Qa'ida has received from its material
sponsors and supporters over more than a decade leading up
to 11 September 2001."
Senate investigators, citing Green Quest and Lloyd's case
files, noted that,
"Mr. Hassabella was a former secretary of
al Taqwa Bank and a shareholder of SAAR Foundation Inc. Mr.
Saleh was a former director and treasurer of the Bahamas
branch of al Taqwa Bank, and president of the Piedmont
Trading Corporation which was part of the SAAR network.
The
U.S. Treasury Department has stated:
'The Al Taqwa group has
long acted as financial advisers to al Qaeda, with offices
in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy and the Caribbean.'
Regarding Akida Bank, the lawsuit complaint alleged that
Sulaiman bin Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi was 'on the board of
directors of Akida Bank in the Bahamas' and that,
'Akida Bank
was run by Youssef Nada, a noted terrorist financier'."
The report went on to state that,
"HSBC was fully aware of
the suspicions that Al Rajhi Bank and its owners were
associated with terrorist financing, describing many of the
alleged links in the Al Rajhi Bank client profile."
As icing on the cake, a 2007 study published by the
Congressional Research Service (CRS)
also found that,
"Saudi individuals and other financiers
associated with the Golden Chain enabled bin Laden and Al
Qaeda to replace lost financial assets and establish a base
in Afghanistan following their abrupt departure from Sudan
in 1996."
Assets I might add, that were used to bankroll
the 9/11
attacks.
'Keen to maintain the
relationships'
HSBC's dubious links to the Al Rajhi Bank didn't end with
information discovered in the "Golden Chain" files; it fact,
they were the tip of the proverbial iceberg.
After 9/11, the FBI reported that three of the hijackers,
Hani Hanjour, Nawaf Alhazmi and Abdulaziz Alomari cashed
thousands of dollars in travelers checks and received wire
transfers from an unnamed individual drawn on accounts at
the Al Rajhi Bank.
As researcher Kevin Fenton pointed out in
Disconnecting the Dots, links among
most of the
hijackers were discovered through their banking
transactions.
"In this context," Fenton wrote, "it is worth
noting that Global Objectives, a British banking compliance
company, identified fifteen of the nineteen hijackers as
high-risk individuals and established database profiles for
them before the attacks... The list of high-risk people
maintained by Global Objectives was available to dozens of
banks," a list that presumably also included HSBC.
While there is no evidence that HSBC, or for that matter the
Al Rajhi Bank, had prior knowledge of the 2001 atrocity, the
gross indifference exhibited by these institutions through
their violation of "know your client" (KYC) rules governing
financial transactions reveal a callous disdain for
elemental norms as they raced to inflate their balance
sheets come hell or high water.
Privileged communications amongst senior staff revealed they
were well aware of the issues and risks involved, yet did
worse than nothing,
they lobbied that HSBC
continue their arrangements with the Al Rajhi Bank.
Suspicions were such that senior staff,
"classified Al Rajhi
Bank as a 'Special Category of Client' (SCC), its highest
risk designation."
This was done, Senate investigators
noted, because the Kingdom was considered a "high risk
country" and due to the fact Al Rajhi's largest shareholder,
Sulaiman bin Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi was considered "a
Politically Exposed Person (PEP)."
Internal HSBC documents also revealed that in 2002, that is,
after the 9/11 provocation,
"the International Private
Banking Department asked to transfer [several] accounts to
HSBC's Institutional Banking Department in Delaware which
had superior ability to monitor account activity."
In fact, transferring Al Rajhi accounts to the bank's
Delaware division would have just the
opposite effect and
bank officials knew it.
As journalist Nicholas Shaxson noted in his exposé of
offshore banking,
Treasure Islands,
"Delaware is the biggest state
provider of offshore corporate secrecy."
Shaxson pointed out
that Delaware's Chancery Court has a,
"'business judgment
rule' under which courts should not second-guess corporate
managers," thereby "granting corporate bosses extraordinary
freedoms from bothersome stockholders, judicial review, and
even public opinion."
So much for any alleged "superior ability to monitor account
activity"!
HBUS's Joseph Harpster wrote an email, stating:
"The most
recent concern arose when three wire transfers for small
amounts ($50k, $3k and $1.5k) were transferred through the
account for names that closely resembled names, not exact
matches, of the terrorists involved in the 9/11 World Trade
Center attack...
The profile of the main account reflects
a doubling of wire transfer volume since 9/01, a large
number of travelers checks but with relatively low value and
some check/cash deposits. According to the account officer,
traffic increased because they have chosen to send us more
business due to their relationship with Saudi British Bank
and the added strength of HBC versus Republic...
Maintaining our business with this name is strongly
supported by David Hodghinson of [Saudi British Bank] and
Andre Dixon, Deputy Chairman of [HSBC Bank Middle East].
Niall Booker and Alba Khoury [of HBUS] also support."
Aside from adverse publicity, the "low value" of the
transactions seemed not to have troubled Harpster or his
associates in the least.
After all, the total "cost" of
murdering 3,000 human beings were certainly small compared
to the price of a vacation home in the Hamptons or a new Maserati.
Anxious there might be increased scrutiny from regulators
(no worries there!), Harpster's email was forwarded by
Douglas Stolberg, the head of Commercial and Institutional
Banking to Alexander Flockhart, then a senior executive in
Retail and Commercial Banking at HBUS (HSBC Bank USA, N.A.).
Stolberg noted:
"As
we discussed previously, Compliance has raised some concerns
regarding the ongoing maintenance of operating/clearing
accounts for Al Rajhi group."
He forwarded recommendations
on how to handle the account:
"Retain [International Private
Banking] as the relationship manager domicile for continuity
purposes, and as we understand there is interest in further
developing private banking business with family members...
Domicile the actual accounts with Delaware where HBUS's most
robust account screening capabilities reside."
"Screening capabilities" which could be shielded from nosy
regulators due to Delaware's strict bank secrecy laws.
Stolberg went on to state:
"[T]his has become a fairly high
profile situation. Compliances concerns relate to the
possibility that Al Rajhi's account may have been used by
terrorists. If true, this could potentially open HBUS up to
public scrutiny and/or regulatory criticism.
SABB [Saudi
British Bank] are understandably
keen to maintain the
relationships.
As this matter concerns
primarily reputational and compliance risks, we felt it
appropriate for SMC [Senior Management Committee]
members to be briefed... so that they may opine on the
acceptability of the plan. Please advise how you would
prefer us to proceed."
According to Senate staff,
"Mr. Harpster reported a week
later that Mr. Flockhart had decided to transfer the
accounts to HBUS in the Delaware office."
But HSBC weren't the only entities hoping to curry favor
with the Kingdom.
A 2009 Government Accountability Office (GAO)
report went on to note that,
"certain performance targets set
by the State Department had been dropped in 2009, such as
the establishment of a Saudi Commission on Charities to
oversee actions taken by Saudi charities abroad as well as
certain regulations of cash couriers."
Although GAO,
"recommended that the United States reinstate
the dropped performance targets to prevent the flow of funds
from Saudi Arabia 'through mechanisms such as cash couriers,
to terrorists and extremists outside Saudi Arabia,' the
State Department's 'most recent annual International
Narcotics Control Strategy Report contains no information
about Saudi Arabia's anti-money laundering or terrorist
financing efforts'."
One reason why the
State Department's report contains "no information" just
might be the Obama administration's policy of supporting
Saudi-backed Salafi terrorists soon to come online in Libya
and Syria, financed through "Saudi charities abroad" or more
directly through "cash couriers."
'You'd better be making lots
of money!'
The Senate disclosed that HSBC,
"provided Al Rajhi Bank with
a wide range of banking services, including wire transfers,
foreign exchange, trade financing, and asset management
services."
"In the United States," investigators learned that "a key
service was supplying Al Rajhi Bank with large amounts of
physical U.S. dollars, through the HBUS U.S. Banknotes
Department."
"The physical delivery of U.S. dollars to Al Rajhi Bank was
carried out primarily through the London branch of HBUS,
often referred to internally as 'London Banknotes'."
Indeed,
"HBUS records indicate that the London Banknotes
office had been supplying U.S. dollars to Al Rajhi Bank for
'25+ years.' In addition to the London branch, HBUS
headquarters in New York opened a banknotes account for Al
Rajhi Bank in January 2001. The U.S. dollars were physically
delivered to Al Rajhi Bank in Saudi Arabia."
"On one occasion in 2008," Senate staff reported, the head
of HSBC Global Banknotes Department told a colleague: 'In
case you don't know, no other banknotes counterparty has
received so much attention in the last 8 years than Alrajhi.'
Despite, in the words of the KYC client profile, a
'multitude' of allegations, HSBC chose to provide Al Rajhi
bank with banking services on a global basis."
Even though the Al Rajhi Bank "had not been indicted,
designated a terrorist financier, or sanctioned," HSBC's
Group Compliance section recommended that affiliates should
sever their ties.
After that initial decision however,
"HSBC affiliates
disregarded the recommendation and continued to do business
with the bank, while others terminated their relationships
but protested HSBC's decision and urged HSBC to reverse it."
Complaints by lower level staff continued, disregarded by
higher-ups, even though a U.S. indictment was issued in
February 2005 for two individuals,
"accused among other
matters, of cashing $130,000 in U.S. travelers cheques at Al
Rajhi Bank in Saudi Arabia" and then smuggling the cash to
CIA-backed terrorists in Chechnya.
Although internal bank documents showed that officials
decided to cut their ties to the Saudi financial
institution, they reversed themselves when pressure was
brought to bear by Al Rajhi officials.
Between 2006 and
2010, Al Rajhi received shipments totaling more than $1
billion in physical cash in the lucrative banknotes business
from HSBC's U.S. affiliate according to investigators.
Officials at the Saudi bank,
"had threatened to pull all of
its business from HSBC if the U.S. banknotes business were
not restored."
Senate staff reported that on January 4, 2005,
"HBUS AML
Compliance head Ms. Pesce sent an email to Daniel Jack, an
HBUS AML Compliance Officer who often dealt with the London
Banknotes office, instructing him to:
'[p]lease communicate
that Group Compliance will be recommending terminating the
Al Rajhi relationship.'
Mr. Jack inquired as to when that
recommendation would be made.
She responded:
'I expect to
see an email from Susan Wright today. She tells me that HBME
[HSBC Bank Middle East] does not agree with Compliance and
will not be terminating the relationship from the Middle
East, but she/David B[agley] recommend that in light of US
scrutiny, climate, and interest by law enforcement, we in
the US sever the relationship from here'."
At the time, Susan Wright was,
"the Chief Money Laundering
Control Officer for the entire HSBC Group. She reported to
David Bagley, head of the HSBC Group's overall Compliance
Department."
Senate investigators noted that the,
"documents do not
explain why HSBC Middle East disagreed with the decision or
why it was allowed to continue its relationship with Al Rajhi Bank, when HSBC's Group Compliance had decided to
sever the relationship between the bank and other HSBC
affiliates due to terrorist financing concerns."
It soon became clear however, that,
"HSBC Group Compliance
began to narrow its scope." Shortly thereafter a trader in
the Banknotes department wrote, "for us is business as
usual." Alan Ketley, HBUS AML Compliance Officer commented
on the decision not to include Al Rajhi Trading in their
earlier decision to sever all ties: "Looks like you're fine
to continue dealing with Al Rajhi. You'd better be making
lots of money!"
Meanwhile,
"Al Rajhi Bank communicated the threat to 'pull
any new business with HSBC' unless given a 'satisfactory
explanation' why HSBC had stopped supplying it with U.S.
dollars via its relationship managers," the Senate
disclosed.
In short order, it was business as usual.
Despite continuing allegations of terrorist financing
swirling around Al Rajhi Bank, HBUS (HSBC Bank USA, N.A.),
"continued to supply,
through its London branch, hundreds of millions of U.S.
dollars to Al Rajhi Bank in Saudi Arabia. In addition, at Al
Rajhi Bank's request, HBUS expanded the relationship in January 2009, by
authorizing its Hong Kong branch to supply Al Rajhi Bank
with non-U.S. currencies, including the Thai bat, Indian
rupee, and Hong Kong dollar."
When concerns were raised internally once again,
Christopher Lok, the head of HSBC's Global Banknotes Department in New
York fired back:
"This is an on-going debate that will never
go away. My stance remains the same, i.e. until it[']s
proved we cannot simply rely on the Wall Street Journal['s]
reports and unconfirmed allegations and 'punish the
client'."
Needless to say, Hong Kong's "arrangement" with Al Rajhi
went forward.
Despite "troubling information" which should have led to
HSBC's quick exit from the banknotes market, the Senate
reported that,
"HBUS continued to supply U.S. dollars to the
bank, and even expanded its business, until 2010, when HSBC
decided, on a global basis, to exit the U.S. banknotes
business."
***
In conclusion, one needn't be a "conspiracy buff" to posit a
link from HSBC to Al Rajhi to "cash couriers" operating
across the Middle East in support of a multitude of
U.S.-Saudi-backed "regime change" gambits in play today;
policies which "worked marvelously well in Afghanistan
against the Red Army."
As investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy pointed out in
The Observer, the issues involved here are wider
than drug money laundering or terrorist finance.
"It is
about where banks, law enforcement officers and the
regulators - and politics and society generally - want to
draw the line between the criminal and supposed 'legal'
economies."
Commenting on the HSBC scandal,
Robert Mazur, a former
Customs Department deep-cover specialist and author of
The Infiltrator, who penetrated Medellín cartel
money laundering operations during the
prosecution and
collapse of BCCI in 1991, told
The Observer that,
"the only thing that will
make the banks properly vigilant to what is happening is
when they hear the rattle of handcuffs in the
boardroom."
"The stark truth is," Vulliamy wrote, "the notion of any
dichotomy between the global criminal economy and the
'legal' one is fantasy. Worse, it is a lie. They are
seamless, mutually interdependent - one and the same."
