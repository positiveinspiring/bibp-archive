Agenda 21 is an United Nations action plan
that basically defines how citizens will live in the 21th
Century.
Under the guise of eco-sustainability and
other you-must-agree-with buzz words, the plan ultimately reduces the
freedoms and living conditions of citizens, not to mention reduce individual
and property rights.
A major component of this action plan is to get
citizens out of rural and suburbans areas to get them to live in dense,
highly planned and controlled mega-cities. The elite wants to see citizens
use less space, own less land and real estate and they want them to fully
depend on state-owned public transportation.
Corporations like IBM are highly involved in the creation of these smart
cities.
IBM has massive contracts lined up to create smart cities.
And they are promoting them
BIG TIME.
Concrete action is now being taken to push this plan forward.
The U.S. government is looking to implement new
policies to discourage people from living in the suburbs and to promote
living in major cities. Heres a report from FOX News about the plan.
However, dont be fooled however: While the
report blames
Obama and the Democrats for the plan,
it was already in action when
Bush and the Republicans were in power.
Plans of
the
world elite advance no matter whos in power..
Heres the report.
