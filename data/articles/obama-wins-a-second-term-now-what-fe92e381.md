I'm certainly glad the election is finally over.
While I have loved politics my entire life, this
presidential election has gone on for over three years, including the GOP
primaries, and I've had my fill of meaningless slogans and counter-slogans,
lies and counter-lies.
I had to quit watching political news the last
few weeks, as I thought I would become physically sick if I watched any more
establishment political "experts" give their required opinions and
propaganda bites.
The 2012 presidential election has been like a ballgame hyped and built up
over three years.
We are programmed to cheer and act out
our sheep-like roles in partisan politics when, like the game, unless we
have money bet on the outcome the actual winner will have absolutely no
impact on our lives.
This was destined to be a close, statistically tied election, as get out the
vote efforts included repetitive harping on its life-changing importance and
the evils of the opposition candidates and party.
The bottom line is that voting percentages
generate credibility for the failed American political system.
"There's not a dime's worth of difference
between the Democrat and Republican parties."
George Wallace
1966 Alabama governor and presidential
candidate
Note it now takes 71 cents to equal the
purchasing power of a dime in 1966 - if you believe the false inflation
statistics out of Washington.
Actually, I could buy a soft drink for a dime in
1966 whereas today it is closer to $1.50. Check house prices even with the
pullback or college tuition if you want an accurate inflation estimate.
It is reasonable to expect from Obama's second term more of the same as the
first four years.
The two main US political parties promote nearly
identical policies; nothing will change from earlier
Bush and
Clinton administration policies. Of
course, there will be a burst of optimism from Democrats and the usual
rallying cries for everybody to come together to meet the challenges of the
moment.
This is just the usual garbage fed to the voting
public after every presidential election.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but both presidents and the
representatives we reelect to Congress only represent the powerful banking
and economic interests that control the federal government and use it to
further their
power elite agenda.
Real, productive citizens can only look to their
government representatives to solve minor bureaucratic issues on lost
checks, eligibility for this program or that or to listen only to
their complaints and agenda.
In reality, the Senate and House of Representatives by necessity - except in
the case of those few with actual philosophical convictions on the right or
the left - only represent and govern based on the financial handouts and
doors opened by powerful interests.
This is the only way they can be reelected.
Why Romney Lost
Romney lost for two main reasons: as he correctly noted during the campaign,
47 percent of American families are dependent on government handouts and
they voted for what was in their own best interests.
Democracy is mob rule and the 47 percent,
although with the best of intentions, are still only a mob out to get what
they can from others who have earned or produced the wealth in the private
sector.
"There are 47 percent who are with [Obama],
who are dependent upon government, who believe they are victims, who
believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who
believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to
you name it."
- Mitt Romney
Still, there is a positive outcome with this
depressing statistic.
-
First, many government employees and
those on the dole understand the problems of bureaucracy far better
than Americans in the private sector because they are caught in the
government trap themselves.
They often have the courage to even vote
against their best interests because they see what it has done to
them personally.
Every TSA agent and government employee in non-essential services
outside of the armed forces, real police and fire protection and
real teachers - not the hundreds of thousands of unionized,
make-work employees who use the system - are simply parasites.
-
Second, the GOP leadership antagonized
the 10 percent of the Republican Party electorate who supported
Ron Paul for President.
Of course, the establishment is still
deathly scared of the Ron Paul movement and their harsh treatment
and the subsequent blowback on November 6 guarantees any discussion
here will be verboten and seldom mentioned for obvious reasons.
While some voted for Romney, a few - as
the returns show - voted third-party and many like me just sat home
on election day disgusted at the entire political charade.
Romney lost because he needed a majority
of this 10 percent to win yet those controlling his campaign simply
threw this voting block away because it threatened powerful central
banking, neocon and moneyed interests supporting the GOP.
While Romney would have made a better
president than Obama in at least his rhetoric, as he pays lip
service to conservative Republican values, in reality his neocon
controllers would probably have made him a disaster in foreign
policy.
And so over the next four years the people will
be provoked and buy more guns they will never have the courage to use to
defend themselves against an all-powerful government.
The GOP will raise more money using faux social
issues and an agenda they never really have any interest in standing up for.
Obama will be painted as an evil, Muslim-born in
God-knows-where socialist when in actuality he has no more power than
Romney would have had to restore the America we loved and respected.
The game will go on until the time is up for our nation.
In the meantime, austerity measures will
dramatically increase, benefits and promises will be lost by the poor and
remaining middle class citizens who really need them and taxes will rise, as
will the risk of gold and wealth confiscation. Obama will be blamed, just as
Romney would have been blamed had he been elected president, for this is how
our regulatory/debt democracy works today in the 21st century.
A failed system of central bank control leading
a failed economy, a failing currency and a controlled system totally
divorced from control or limitation by the citizens of America.
The Solution is to
Change the Political Structure
The solution is a return to a limited, decentralized confederation form of
government like our first legitimate American government,
the Articles of Confederation.
One that is responsible to the people and
ultimately controlled by the voters with the iron-clad political tools of
initiative and referendum like exists in Switzerland today, where voters
have the right to reject legislation and laws or enact laws outside the
power of controlled legislative, judiciary and executive branches of
government.
Until we return to the Articles of
Confederation, America and our liberties are doomed to extinction by the
hidden control of international banking and economic elites.
After the election you can expect appeals from "so-called" conservatives or
libertarians wanting your hard-earned money to support this or that cause.
They will claim time is running out, the next election is the most important
in your lifetime, etc.
Time is not running out; it ran out long ago,
and voting for either party or most candidates is just an exercise in
futility supporting the corrupt system that rules over you.
We are serfs and mere subjects to a system and
few understand or even recognize the control over us.
If you want to be a free people again educate yourself on the Swiss system
of government and work for a return to the government for which our patriot
founding fathers risked their lives and property, the Articles of
Confederation. Supporting anything less is just deceiving ourselves and
screwing our posterity. We may deserve the kind of government we have
allowed to take over our country but our posterity deserve better.
The GOP Ron Paul for President campaigns in 2008 and 2012 clearly showed
how the controlled, two-party system in the United States will allow no
real opposition to its approved candidates in either party.
You can bet your worthless vote that new
Republican Party rules at the 2012 GOP convention and at the state level in
the future will control any viable opposition candidates.
The only current outlets for alternative
political action are in doomed-to-fail third-party activities that are
little more than allowed but controlled political opposition.
To restore the original American Republic, we must change the controlled
monopoly political system of government that controls and destroys
internally or externally all opposition. New candidates or even attempts at
party control accomplish little when the same powerful interests control the
political structure.
We must work to remove the system in place and
restore the limited government of our founding fathers, for they had devised
a system that would work well today with our ease of transportation and
communication.
Remember, our children and grandchildren deserve a better, more prosperous
world and nation than we have left them at this point. It is time we as a
generation man up for liberty to redeem ourselves in the tear-filled eyes of
future generations.
The American people must work peacefully to
restore the Articles of Confederation now or else suffer the permanent
consequences of the fall of America.
