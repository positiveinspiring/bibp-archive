Mexico is in the grip of
a murderous drug war that has killed over 150,000
people since 2006.
It is one of the most
violent countries on earth.
This drug war is a
product of the transnational drug trade which is
worth up to $400 billion a year and accounts for
about
8% of all international
trade.
The American government maintains that there is
no alternative but to vigorously prosecute their zero tolerance policy of
arresting drug users and their dealers. This has led to the incarceration of
over 500,000 Americans.
Meanwhile the flood of illegal drugs into America
continues unabated.
One thing the American government has not done
is to prosecute the largest banks in the world for supporting the drug
cartels by washing billions of dollars of their blood stained money.
As Narco sphere journalist
Bill Conroy has
observed banks are "where the money is" in the global drug
war.
-
HSBC
-
Western Union
-
Bank of America
-
JP Morgan Chase&Co
-
Citigroup
-
Wachovia,
...amongst many others have allegedly failed to
comply with American anti-money laundering (AML) laws.
The Mexican drug cartels have caught the
headlines again and again due to their murderous activities.
The war between the different drug cartels and
the war between the cartels and government security forces has spilled the
blood of tens of thousands of innocent people. The drug cartels would find
it much harder to profit from their murderous activity if they didnt have
too big to fail banks willing to wash their dirty money.
In March 2010 Wachovia cut a deal with the US
government which involved the bank being given fines of $160 million under a
"deferred prosecution" agreement.
This was due to Wachovias heavy involvement in
money laundering moving up to $378.4 billion over several years. Not one
banker was prosecuted for illegal involvement in the drugs trade. Meanwhile
small time drug dealers and users go to prison.
If any member of the public is caught in
possession of a few grams of coke or heroin you can bet your bottom dollar
they will be going down to serve some hard time.
However, if you are a bankster caught laundering
billions of dollars for some of the most murderous people on the planet you
get off with a slap on the wrist in the form of some puny fine and a
deferred prosecution deal.
Charles A. Intriago, president of the
Miami-based
Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists has
observed,
"
If youre an individual, and get caught,
you get hammered.
"But if youre a big bank, and youre caught
moving money for a terrorist or drug dealer, you dont have to worry. You
just fork over a monetary penalty, and then raise your fees to make up for
it.
"Until we see bankers walking off in handcuffs
to face charges in these cases, nothing is going to change," Intriago adds.
"These monetary penalties are just a cost of doing business to them, like
paying for a new corporate jet."
This failure on the behalf of the US government
to really crack down on the finances of the drug cartels extends to British
banks as well.
In July 2012 the US Senate Committee on
Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs issued a 339
page report
detailing an amazing catalogue of "criminal " behaviour by London
based HSBC. This includes washing over $881 for the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel
and for the Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia.
Besides this, HSBC affiliated banks such as HBUS
repeatedly broke American AML laws by their long standing and severe AML
deficiencies which allowed Saudi banks such as
Al Rajhi
to finance terrorist groups that included
Al-Qaeda.
HBUS the American affiliate of
HSBC
supplied Al Rajhi bank with nearly $1 billion in US dollars.
Jack Blum an attorney and former
Senate investigator has commented,
"They violated every goddamn law in the
book. They took every imaginable form of illegal and illicit business."
HSBC affiliate HBUS was repeatedly instructed to
improve its anti-money laundering program.
In 2003 the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
took enforcement action that called upon HBUS to improve its anti-money
laundering program. In September 2010 the Office of
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) sent a, "blistering supervisory
letter" to HBUS listing numerous AML problems at the bank.
In October
2010 this was followed up with the OCC issuing a cease and desist order
requiring HBUS to improve its AML program a second time.
Senator
Carl Levin chairman of the Senate investigation into HSBC has
commented
that ,
"HSBCs
Chief Compliance Officer and other senior executives in London knew what
was going on, but allowed the deceptive conduct to continue."
Let us look at just a couple of the devastating
findings in the
Senate report.
The main focus of the report is the multiple
failures of HSBC to comply with AML laws and regulations:
"The identified problems
included a once massive backlog of over 17,000 alerts identifying possible
suspicious activity that had yet to be reviewed; ineffective methods for
identifying suspicious activity; a failure to file timely Suspicious
Activity Reports with U.S. law
enforcement;
a
3-year failure by HBUS [a HSBC affiliate], from mid-2006 to mid-2009, to
conduct any AML monitoring of $15 billion in bulk cash transactions
a
failure to monitor $60 trillion in annual wire transfer activity by
customers
inadequate and unqualified AML staffing; inadequate AML
resources; and AML leadership problems.
Since many of these
criticisms targeted severe, widespread, and long standing AML
deficiencies,
.."
The
report
catalogues in great detail the failings of HSBC affiliates HBUS in America
and HMEX in Mexico:
"from 2007 through 2008,
HBMX was the single largest exporter ofU.S. dollars to HBUS, shipping $7
billion in cash to HBUS over two years, outstripping larger Mexican banks
and other HSBC affiliates. Mexican and U.S. authorities expressed repeated
concern that HBMXs bulk cash shipments could reach that volume only if they
included illegal drug proceeds.
The concern was that drug
traffickers unable to deposit large amounts of cash in U.S. banks due to AML
controls were transporting U.S. dollars to Mexico, arranging for bulk
deposits there, and then using Mexican financial institutions to insert the
cash back into the U.S. financial system
high profile clients involved in
drug trafficking; millions of dollars in suspicious bulk travelers cheque
transactions; inadequate staffing and resources; and a huge backlog of
accounts marked for closure due to suspicious activity, but whose closures
were delayed."
In the
Senate hearing on 17 July
2012 Carl Levin Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs explained how HMEX helped the Mexican drug cartels:
"Because our
tough AML laws in the United States have made it hard for drug cartels to
find a U.S. bank willing to accept huge unexplained deposits of cash, they
now smuggle U.S. dollars across the border into Mexico and look for a
Mexican bank or casa de cambio willing to take the cash.
Some of
those casas de cambios had accounts at HBMX. HBMX, in turn, took all
the physical dollars it got and transported them by armored car or aircraft
back across the border to HBUS for deposit into its U.S. banknotes account,
completing the laundering cycle."
Senator
Levin went on to note how,
"Over two
years, from 2007 to 2008, HBMX shipped $7 billion in physical U.S. dollars
to HBUS. That was more than any other Mexican bank, even one twice HBMXs
size.
When law
enforcement and bank regulators in Mexico and the United States got wind of
the banknotes transactions, they warned HBMX and HBUS that such large dollar
volumes were red flags for drug proceeds moving through the HSBC network."
In December 2012 the Department of Justice cut a
deal with HSBC which imposed a record $1.9 billion dollar fine.
It may sound a lot to ordinary folks but it is a
tiny fraction of its annual profits which in 2011 totaled $22 billion.
Assistant Attorney General Lanny Bauer announced the settlement at a press
conference on 11 December 2012.
His comments reveal why the US government
decided to go soft on such criminal behavior and show quite clearly how
there is one law for the richest 1% and one law for the rest of us.
Lenny Bauer said:
"Had the U.S. authorities decided to press
criminal charges, HSBC would almost certainly have lost its banking license
in the U.S., the future of the institution would have been under threat and
the entire banking system would have been destabilized."
Think about that statement for a moment.
A bank that has quite clearly been caught out
helping murderous drug criminals, terrorist groups, third world
dictatorships and all sorts of criminal characters is to be let off with a
slap on the wrist. No criminal prosecutions or even a mention of criminal
behavior due to the fears that to do so would put the world economy in
jeopardy.
So there you have it.
Banksters who engage in such behavior that is
regarded as criminal by the vast majority of people on the planet are not
only too big to fail they are also too big to jail.
After the Department of Justice announcement of
the deferred prosecution HSBC Chief Executive
Stuart Gulliver said,
"We accept responsibility for our past
mistakes. We have said we are profoundly sorry for them, and we do so
again."
Such statements will provide little solace to
the families of the 150,000 people estimated by US Secretary of Defence
Leon Panetta to have been killed in Mexicos drug war.
Nor will it help the hundreds of thousands of
Mexican citizens who have been forced to flee their homes and escape the
violence by going to the United Sates or moving to other parts of Mexico.
Senator Elizabeth Warren appearing at a meeting
of the Senate Banking Committee in February
expressed frustration with officials from the US Treasury
Department and US Federal Reserve over the issue of why criminal charges
were not pressed on HSBC or any of its officials.
The officials were evasive when she tried to
draw them on the issue of what it takes for a bank to have its license
withdrawn:
"HSBC paid a fine, but no one individual went to
trial, no individual was banned from banking, and there was no hearing to
consider shutting down HSBCs activities here in the United States.
So, what Id like is, youre the experts on
money laundering. Id like an opinion: What does it take - how many billions
do you have to launder for drug lords and how many economic sanctions do you
have to violate - before someone will consider shutting down a financial
institution like this?"
Senator Warren finished the session by
commenting on the glaring double standards within the US justice
system:
"You know, if youre caught with an ounce of
cocaine, the chances are good youre going to go to jail. If it happens
repeatedly, you may go to jail for the rest of your life.
But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion
dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your
company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night,
every single individual associated with this. I think thats fundamentally
wrong."
On 4 March 2013 HSBC announced profits of $20.6
billion in 2012 while it paid out a $3 million bonus to its CEO.
This outrageous state of affairs beggars belief
after HSBC has been clearly caught out engaging in activity on behalf of
murderous drug lords, terrorist financing banks and brutal third world
dictatorships. Where is the British Governments condemnation of HSBC?
You may be waiting a long time for that
considering the fact that Chancellor George Osborne and his fellow ministers
are intimately connected to the British banking elite.
Long time observer of the Mexican drug war
Bill Conroy
comments that the deal cut with HSBC by the Department of
Justice,
"should illuminate for all the great
pretense of the drug war - no matter how hard US prosecutors, via the
mainstream media, attempt to convince us otherwise
And it should lead us to conclude, if we are
honest with ourselves, that the so-called drug war is little more than
one immense 'drug deal'."
