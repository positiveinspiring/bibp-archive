The Great Invocation - Stanza One
Let the Forces of Light bring illumination to all mankind.
Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad.
May men of goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation.
May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time.
Let power attend the efforts of the Great Ones.
So let it be and help us to do our part.
October 1939
In my last article, I suggested giving you some facts anent the Great Invocation and
some explanation of its significance and meanings. These may enable the occult students in
the world today to use it with greater fervor and with greater understanding and,
consequently, with greater success.
There are several such mantric formulas and Words of Power in use by such students but
they fail to accomplish very much because the person using them has no real understanding
of their import and purpose and is usually so focused in his emotional, aspirational,
astral nature that all that he says and does (in connection with such Words of Power) is
entirely innocuous and futile. Words of Power, ancient mantrams (such as the Lord's
Prayer) and the Great Invocation are only effective if used upon the mental plane and with
the power of a controlled mind - focused on their intent and meaning - behind the spoken
effort. They then become potent. When said with the power of the soul as well as with the
directed attention of the mind, they automatically become dynamically effective.
Students
all the world over have for years used the Sacred Word, and have sounded the OM with great
diligence. I would like here to ask: With what results? I myself will reply. With
practically no results except a slight stimulation of the aspiration and a small awakening
of the creative imagination. This means that the results achieved have had effect only
within the aura of the person concerned and have not penetrated into his environment
or produced any recognizable effects. The OM is potent and [145] dynamically effective
when rightly used and will produce changes, destroy that which must be eliminated or
ended, and will build in, by attraction and consolidation that which is desired into the
fabric of the group life, producing incidentally (though none the less certainly)
needed changes and the wise reconstruction of the individual life. Ponder upon this.
If the
above is true of the OM and of its group effects, it is infinitely more true of the Great
Invocation. Words of Power (and this is true also of the OM) are all of second ray origin.
This is the ray of the manifestation of consciousness. They are, therefore, intended for soul
use because the soul is the expression of the second aspect of divinity, and
only the soul can really employ these Words and sounds and thus produce the desired
results which are always in line with the divine Plan. It is frequently forgotten that
they must be used by the soul in a dynamic manner, involving the serious recognition of
the will aspect.
The Great Invocation, the OM and all such Words of Power
must go forth from the soul (whose nature is love and whose purpose is solely group good),
backed by or "occultly propelled forth" (to use a translation of an almost
untranslatable occult idea) by the dynamic will aspect, and carried outwards as an
integrated thought-form upon a stream of living, illumined mental substance. This process
therefore brings into activity the will, the love and the intelligence of the man who is
using these words and formulas. Frequently, however, an hiatus occurs even when a man has
integrated these three controlling factors within himself as far as he is able to do so at
his particular point in evolution.
All that he has succeeded in doing is the retaining of
the created thought-form upon the mental plane; he fails to make its presence felt upon the
physical plane and to achieve the desired results because his brain (the lower receiving
and distributing center within the head) is incapable of the needed dual activity -
retaining awareness of the intent, meaning and purpose of the formula being used and, at
the same time, carrying on the task of sending forth the potency, [146] hidden yet
conveyed by the Words or sounds.
These two activities must be carried on simultaneously by
the soul on its own plane through the medium of the mind and the brain. Here again is one
of the objectives of all meditation work but one which is not emphasized as it is a
sequential happening and not an objective. Effectiveness is, therefore, dependent upon a
grasp of the above facts and a developed and trained integration between soul, mind,
desire, brain and the spoken Word or sound.
