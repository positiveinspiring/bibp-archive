# Putin Exposes Obama's Lame Duck Attempt to Start a New Cold War by 
Refusing to Retaliate

Russian President
Vladimir Putin broke with
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov - who had earlier vowed to
expel 35 U.S. diplomats in response to the same move by the
Obama
administration - announcing Russia would not stoop to
unilateral pettiness displayed by outgoing American leadership,
stating:
"We reserve the right to
retaliate, but we will not sink to the level of this
irresponsible 'kitchen' diplomacy.
We will take further moves on
restoring Russian-American relations based on the policies
that the administration of President-elect Donald Trump
adopts."

Further, Putin deftly
admonished the timing of actions by the U.S., promising
American diplomats in Russia would encounter no restrictions of
movement or business - and even extended a personal invitation
their children spend the New Year holiday celebrating around the
Christmas tree at the Kremlin.
Yesterday, the White House
issued an eleventh-hour amendment to a 2015
Executive Order
allowing proportional cyber and military response to attacks on
"critical infrastructure" to include State actors who,
"[t]amper with, alter, or cause
a misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect
of interfering with or undermining election processes or
institutions."
By so doing, the administration was
then able to issue sanctions against Russian entities and
individuals - including the expulsion of 35 diplomats from the
United States within 72 hours of the decree, and barring entry
to two compounds - as a response for allegations 'Russian
hackers' had interfered in the presidential election.
Obama boldly declared,
"data theft
and disclosure activities could only have been directed by the
highest levels of the Russian government",
...intimating these
actions were coordinated from as high a position as Putin,
himself - an accusation previously and repeatedly laughed off by
Russian officials.
Indeed, no proof of the 'hackers'
claim has yet been offered - a joint 'report'
from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) released the same day bore no evidence Russian
State actors had meddled in the electoral process, much less
hacked systems of the Democratic Party or the election.
Notably, that joint 'report' even
came with a disclaimer which, in essence, says DHS does not back
the information it contains, stating,
"This report is provided 'as is'
for informational purposes only. The Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) does not provide any warranties of any kind
regarding any information contained within."
Russian politicians expressed
disgust with the moves by the Obama administration - undertaken
despite the complete lack of evidence Russia had done anything
wrong - as a provocation from a moot regime on its way out of
office.
Konstantin Dolgov,
Russian Commissioner Foreign Ministry on human rights,
democracy and the rule of law, replied to the expulsion of
diplomats and barring of entry into two Russian-owned
compounds located inside the U.S.,
noting,
"I can only reconfirm this
hysteria demonstrates the complete lack of orientation
by the outgoing U.S. administration."
Lavrov
balked at the overtly aggressive actions, stating
publicly the moves could not go unanswered:
"Of course, we cannot leave
such mischievous tricks without a response. Reciprocity
is the law of diplomacy and of international relations."
Konstantin Kosachev, head
of the International Committee of the Russian Upper House of
Parliament, told RIA Novosti, as
cited by the Observer,
"The leaving administration
has no reason and no political or moral right for such
drastic and disruptive steps with regards to bilateral
relations with Russia.
Forgive me for being harsh, but I
just cannot find other words: this is the agony of not
the lame ducks, but of political corpses. [President
Obama] put at stake the US' reputation as an adequate
state that ensures policy continuity in the process of
change of power."
Putin - seemingly the only cool
head in heightening tensions between the two former Cold War
foes - decided against the tit-for-tat actions traditionally
permitted under rules of international diplomacy, and
instead brutally but flatly excoriated the Obama regime,
noting:
"It's a pity that the
current U.S. administration is finishing their work in
such a manner."
In one fell swoop - with an
iciness biting to the bone - it appears Putin can be
declared the victor in this absurd and unnecessary battle of
will...
