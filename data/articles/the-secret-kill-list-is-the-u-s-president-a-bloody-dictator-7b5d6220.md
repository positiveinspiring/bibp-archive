The leader of the government regularly sits down with his senior generals
and spies and advisers and reviews a list of the people they want him to
authorize their agents to kill.
They do this every Tuesday morning when the
leader is in town. The leader once condemned any practice even close to
this, but now relishes the killing because he has convinced himself that it
is a sane and sterile way to keep his country safe and himself in power. The
leader, who is running for re-election, even invited his campaign manager to
join the group that decides whom to kill.
This is not from a work of fiction, and it is not describing a series of
events in the Kremlin or Beijing or Pyongyang. It is a fair summary of a
6,000-word investigative report in The New York Times earlier this week
about the White House of
Barack Obama.
Two Times journalists, Jo Becker and
Scott Shane,
painstakingly and chillingly reported that the former
lecturer in constitutional law and liberal senator who railed against
torture and Gitmo now weekly reviews a secret kill list, personally decides
who should be killed and then dispatches killers all over the world - and
some of his killers have killed Americans.
We have known for some time that President Obama is waging a private
war.
By that I mean he is using
the CIA on his own -
and not the military after congressional authorization - to fire drones at
thousands of persons in foreign lands, usually while they are riding in a
car or a truck. He has done this both with the consent and over the
objection of the governments of the countries in which he has killed.
He
doesn't want to talk about this, but he doesn't deny it.
-
How chilling is it that
David Axelrod - the
president's campaign manager - has periodically seen the secret kill list?
-
Might this be to keep the killings politically correct?
-
Can the president legally do this?
In a word: No.
The president cannot lawfully order the killing of anyone, except according
to the Constitution and federal law.
Under the Constitution, he can only
order killing using the military,
-
when the U.S. has been attacked
-
when an
attack is so imminent and certain that delay would cost innocent American
lives
-
in pursuit of a congressional declaration of war
Under federal law, he can only order killing
using civilians when a person has been sentenced lawfully to death by a
federal court and the jury verdict and the death sentence have been upheld
on appeal.
If he uses the military to kill, federal law requires public
reports of its use to Congress and congressional approval after 180 days.
The U.S. has not declared war since World War II. If the president knows
that an attack on our shores is imminent, he'd be hard-pressed to argue
convincingly that a guy in a truck in a desert 10,000 miles from here - no
matter his intentions - poses a threat to the U.S. so imminent and certain
that he needs to be killed on the spot in order to save the lives of
Americans who would surely die during the time it would take to declare war
on the country that harbors him, or during the time it would take to arrest
him.
Under no circumstances may he use civilian
agents for non-judicial killing. Surely, CIA agents can use deadly force to
protect themselves, but they may not use it offensively.
Federal laws against murder apply to the
president and to all federal agents and personnel, wherever they go on the
planet.
Since 9/11, the United States government has set up national security
systems that function not under the Constitution, not under the Geneva
Conventions, not under the rule of law, not under the rules of war, not
under federal law, but under a new secret system crafted by
the
Bush
administration and personally directed by Obama, the same Obama who
condemned these rules as senator and then extended them as president.
In the name of fighting demons in pick-up trucks
and wars that Congress has never declared, the government,
Obama has argued that his careful consideration of each person he orders
killed and the narrow use of deadly force are an adequate and constitutional
substitute for due process.
The Constitution provides for no such thing.
He
has also argued that the use of drones to do his killing is humane since
they are "surgical" and only kill their targets. We know that is
incorrect.
And he has argued that these killings are consistent with our values.
What is he talking about? The essence of our
values is the rule of law, not the rule of presidents.
