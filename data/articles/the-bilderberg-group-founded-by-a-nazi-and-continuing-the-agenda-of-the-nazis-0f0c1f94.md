When you want to discover what an organization is really all about, it is important to dig down to the roots.
And when you uncover the roots of the Bilderberg Group, you find some very unsettling things. It turns out that the Bilderberg Group has had Nazi connections from the very beginning, and it continues to advance the agenda of the Nazis to this very day.
This year, the Bilderberg Group is meeting from June 11th to June 14th at the Interalpen Hotel which is near the city of Telfs, Austria. This organization has so much power that even several days before the event police are keeping everyone (including reporters) 10 kilometers away from the hotel.
If this is just a group of private citizens getting together to chat about world issues,
Why all the security? What is so special about this group of people that rates such extraordinary measures? And why are they so bound and determined to keep all of the rest of us away from them?

During World War II, the Nazi effort to unite all of Europe (and ultimately the rest of the world) through war failed miserably.
When the war ended, those that believed in that dream decided that another approach would be necessary. Instead of war, a united Europe dominated by Germany would be achieved through international treaties and diplomacy.
In 1957, the European Economic Community was established, and it began with just six countries:
Belgium France Italy Luxembourg the Netherlands West Germany
Belgium
France
Italy
Luxembourg
the Netherlands
West Germany
Since that time, it has expanded to 28 nations and has become known as "the European Union".
The idea for the common currency that the European Union uses today, the euro, was conceived and developed by the Bilderberg Group. This organization has always been at the forefront of European unity, but most people have no idea where it came from.
Well, the truth is that the Bilderberg Group first met in 1954, and one of the key founders of the group was Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. Not only was he a founder, Prince Bernhard actually served as the organization's chairman until 1976.
So why is this important? Most people do not realize this, but Prince Bernhard actually belonged to the Nazi Party at one time.
The following is an excerpt from an article that appeared in The Telegraph
"Bernhard, a secret history" has revealed that the prince was a member of the German Nazi party until 1934, three years before he married Princess Juliana, the future queen of the Netherlands. Annejet van der Zijl, a Dutch historian, has found membership documents in Berlin's Humboldt University that prove Prince Bernhard, who studied there, had joined Deutsche Studentenschaft, a National Socialist student fraternity, as well as the Nazi NSDAP and its paramilitary wing, the Sturmabteilung. He left all the groups on leaving university in December 1934, when he went to work for the German chemical giant, IG Farben.

He left all the groups on leaving university in December 1934, when he went to work for the German chemical giant, IG Farben.
And Prince Bernhard's association with IG Farben also links him to the Nazis.
The following comes from a book entitled "The Nazi Hydra In America" by Glen Yeadon
"The Bilderberg group, founded by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, held its first meeting in 1954. The prince, a former officer in the SS, had worked in IG Farben's notorious NW7 group, which served as spies for the Third Reich. Bernhard belonged to the Dutch branch of the Knights Templar. In 1954, he was appointed to govern the Dutch order. John Foster Dulles was one of the most helpful Americans in setting up the Bilderberg group. Incidentally, in 1954 Dulles testified in favor of a bill designed to return vested enemy assets, such as GAF, to their previous owners."

As the quote above just pointed out, John Foster Dulles was instrumental in helping the Bilderberg Group get established.
His brother, Allen Dulles, was responsible for Operation Paperclip which enabled large numbers of Nazi scientists (among others) to come into the United States and start working for the U.S. government in various capacities.
Allen Dulles was so passionate about this program that it continued even when two presidents tried to shut it down
Dulles' CIA Operation Paperclip assimilated Nazi scientists into the American establishment by obscuring their histories and preventing efforts to bring their true stories to light. The project was led by officers in the United States Army. Although the program officially ended in September 1947, those officers and others carried out a conspiracy until the mid-1950s that bypassed both law and presidential directive to keep Operation Paperclip going. Neither Presidents Truman nor Eisenhower were informed that their instructions were ignored.

The "godfather" of the Bilderberg Group is a former U.S. Secretary of State named Henry Kissinger. He has attended the gathering almost every single year, and he will be there once again in 2015.
This is a man that is so committed to globalization that he even wrote a book entitled "World Order".
But what hardly anyone knows is that he actually discussed overthrowing the West German government with a group of "disgruntled Nazis" back in the 1970s
A German academic has unearthed evidence showing former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once discussed a coup with disgruntled Nazis to overthrow the West German government in the 1970s. Kissinger and Richard Nixon were aggrieved at the left-leaning government of the day's burgeoning friendship with the hardline East German government. Kissinger became the contact man for a secret spy network made up of old Nazis and elite aristocrats aimed at torpedoing the plans formulated by Chancellor Willy Brandt.

The guys behind this movement have been at it for a very long time.
And they are still advancing the values and principles at the heart of the Nazi movement to this very day.
The following are just a few examples of this
Just like the Nazis, they advocate for highly centralized national governments that are heavily socialized. Just like the Nazis, they are deeply committed to globalization. The Nazis sought to establish their empire through war, while these guys seek to do it through diplomacy and negotiation. Just like the Nazis, they believe in strict gun control for the general population, centralized government-controlled education and the removal of organized religion (especially Christianity) from public life. Just like the Nazis, they believe that they are the elite of the world, they are anti-Israel, and they believe in using military power to advance their cause when necessary. And just like the Nazis, they are deeply committed to eugenics and population control.

These days, they use language that is more "politically correct", but most of them are absolutely convinced that the number one problem in our world is overpopulation.

Of course nobody associated with the Bilderberg Group would ever use the word "Nazi" to describe themselves. That term has become so associated with evil that nobody wants anything to do with it. But the values and the principles of the Nazis endure in organizations such as the Bilderberg Group.
The ultimate goal, of course, is a one world government that dominates the entire planet.
Let us hope and pray that they are never able to achieve that.
