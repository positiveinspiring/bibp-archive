Exemplified by the furor over the so-called Ground Zero mosque in New
York, and rumors of a new Al-Qaeda mastermind, 9/11 war on terrorism
propaganda has been ramped up to deafening levels by various political
factions.
Nearly a decade since Bush/Cheneys 9/11 false flag deception, a fearful,
self-destructive American mass public remains fully brainwashed by war on
terrorism deception - ignorant of history, and militantly oblivious to
facts.
Ground Zero mosque - the art of missing the point
The ludicrous uproar over plans to build a Muslim community center in New
York, the so-called Ground Zero mosque has dominated mainstream corporate
news headlines.
Political players from all sides, including President
Barack
Obama have joined the fray, attempting to prove themselves the superior
anti-terrorist, or the better commemorator of 9/11, when 3,000 people
were killed by Muslim terrorists.
The right-wing is going berserk,
gleefully.
Heated arguments have exploded around religion, tolerance, democracy,
etc. - everything except the only fact that matters:
9/11 was a false flag
operation, courtesy of the Bush-Cheney administration, carried out by an
elite consensus, in order to justify the war on terrorism, and everything
that came with it. Mass murder. Unending resource conquest.
A police state
within US borders. Open criminality.
The perpetual threat posed by a fabricated outside enemy, and a militarized,
fearful populace, remain the centerpieces of elite policy, and they have
been consistently maintained by both Bush/Cheney and Obama administrations.
The
demonization of Muslims continues to facilitate pillage.
While violent hatred continues to be directed at Muslims (and all
foreigners), the criminals who truly massacred 3,000 people in the World
Trade Center continue to enjoy power, wealth, and high positions of world
leadership and remain in control of virtually every aspect of society.
Those who perpetuate the cover-up (including the Obama administration) still
run the world, to mass public enthusiasm.
As the Ground Zero mosque mushrooms into a full-blown election year battle
cry by one faction or another, not whisper of truth appears in any corporate
media coverage. Meanwhile, the exhaustive and available information
thoroughly exposing and destroying the official war on terrorism narrative
is unknown to a minority of people whose critical faculties remain intact.
Mike Rupperts Crossing the Rubicon exposed why and how 9/11 was likely
carried out by Bush/Cheney.
Michel Chossudovskys Americas War on
Terrorism thoroughly exposed the 9/11 deception, as well as the fact that,
-
the war on terrorism is a fabrication that serves as the eternal
pretext for global war
-
Al-Qaeda and other Islamic jihad
front are
military-intelligence assets that have been continuously
supported, managed and run by the CIA and affiliates such as Pakistans ISI on behalf of Anglo-American geostrategic interests (notably oil) going
back to the Cold War
A vast number of researchers (all derided as 9/11 truthers) such
David Ray Griffin
continue to detail various aspects of the
case including physical evidence.
Oblivious to the availability of this mountain of conspiracy fact, the
vast majority of the population chooses to embrace the Big Lie.
New Al-Qaeda mastermind named
In recent weeks, mainstream corporate news headlines have exploded with the
revelation that Al-Qaeda has a new leader of global operations in
charge of planning future attacks:
Adnan Shukrijumah
According to Miami-based FBI counterterrorism agent Greg LeBlanc, whose
Associated Press interview in early August is
the single source for the new
spate of repeated headlines, Shukrijumah is alleged to be a 15-year resident
of the US intimately familiar with American society, and is the son of a
Muslim cleric trained in Saudi Arabia.
He have lived in Miramar, Florida
before joining terror training camps in Afghanistan in the 1990s, in order
to fight the persecution of Muslims in Bosnia, Chechnya and elsewhere.
Tagged by LeBlanc as the successor to his former boss Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
(KSM), and taking orders directly from Osama bin Laden. A clip of
Shukrijumah
posted by the FBI is gibberish.
There is nothing new about the Shukrijumah narrative. It is an intelligence
legend years in the making.
Chaim Kupferberg, whose classic analysis of post-9/11 terror propaganda
(Part 1 and
Part Two) are definitive, offered the following thoughts on Shukrijumah in 2004 in a piece titled
The "Official" Operative Clique for
the Next 9/11.
To quote Kupferberg at length:
I'm sure many of you out there are noticing a unified narrative taking
shape in advance of the next expected attack. In calibrated drips and
dollops, the mainstream media, in partnership with the 9/11 panel, are
laying the evidentiary trail pointing to the next "Atta" and his insular
cell, which apparently already seems to be "in place" stateside.
Having no access at all to any insider reports, one can almost foretell the
Official Legend that will follow in the wake of this clique's first big
explosion into the public consciousness - just by reading the mainstream
news.
Certainly, three of these major operatives - Adnan Shukrijumah, Abderrouf
Jdey, and Aafia Siddiqui - are already being linked together. But
Shukrijumah and Jdey are the ones to watch, for they are being intimately
seeded into the Padilla/dirty bomb and Ahmed Ressam/Canadian clique/West
Coast threads of 9/11.
Recently, Shukrijumah was mentioned as the guy likely doing surveillance of
the New York buildings in the latest terror alert. But that was supposed to
be old information. Yet Shukrijumah has been showing up all over the radar
in the past year alongside Jdey and Siddiqui.
When Abu Musab Zarqawi was publicly unveiled by Colin Powell before the UN
in February 2003, he had yet to make his very public splash as the next
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. But in the opening months of 2004 - as I surmised
back in October 2003 - Zarqawi would lay his own foundation in the public
mind (particularly by way of the Daniel Pearl-like Berg killing) as the guy
tagged to head up the next big one.
If the Ressam-connected Canadian clique is involved, the likely target is
the U.S. West Coast.
I suspect this is the case due to three items:
-
the
bulletin last May that alerted the public to Shukrijumah, Jdey, Siddiqui,
Gahdan, el-Maati, and others
-
a reported sighting the next day of Shukrijumah and Jdey at a Denny's in Colorado (they stated that they were
"from Iran" and were en route to the West Coast from New York)
-
the release,
two weeks later, of the official 9/11 staff report that now placed Jdey (in
cahoots with Moussaoui) as an original member of an aborted 9/11 "second
wave" attack on the West Coast
-
a reported sighting of Shukrijumah at a
nuclear research facility in Ontario (while el-Maati had previously been
reported casing nuclear facilities near Ottawa).
Shukrijumah (aka "the next Atta") apparently seems to be threaded into the
1993 bomb plots by way of his father's connection to Clement Hampton-El. But
more strangely, it seems that Shukrijumah will make his way into the
Oklahoma City Bomb thread by way of his Florida connection with "dirty bomb"
guy Jose Padilla. To shore up the Oklahoma thread, we also have the Zarqawi/Moussaoui/
Nick Berg connection.
But let's step back and take a stab at guessing at what is happening here.
The new legends will be used to strengthen the foundations of the old ones.
In parallel to the official account, however, the existing counter-legends
will also be beefed up. In short, the narratives are getting all too muddled
with the growing interlinking chains. The growing complexity of these new
interlinking legends will operate to turn off a good portion of those who
might be seriously interested in examining the truth behind 9/11.
And what of the rest of us? Will we be locked in a never-ending cycle of
polarized argument - with each of us picking his favorite conspiracy thread?
How many of us will look at Shukrijumah and see the fingerprints of Iran?
How many of us will look at the Canadian clique and sense the hand of Syria
behind it all? And if they find that the next operation was pulled off with
forged New Zealand passports, how many of us will dig up the newspaper
account of the Mossad/ New Zealand passport scandal and go Aha! Once again
the Israelis!
And what about the anthrax thread?
In recent months, a writer by the name of
Ross Getman has been posting accounts that read like excerpts from a future
Official 9/11 Sequel Report. Going by Getman's writings, it would appear
that a possible Boston connection would involve anthrax by way of Aafia
Siddiqui's connection to Brandeis University and its anthrax facility.
Also
note that a first sighting of Shukrijumah and Jdey a year ago occurred in
Maine, where they were spotted driving with a Massachusetts license plate.
So, to sum up: Shukrijumah seems to be part of a "dirty bomb" or
radiological thread, while Siddiqui seems to be part of an anthrax thread.
Perhaps the Shukrijumah/Jdey/Siddiqui clique is planning a bi-coastal attack
involving radiological materials (or perhaps an attack on a nuclear
facility) and a simultaneous attack involving anthrax.
Shukrijumah has been
marketed as an "Atta-level" pilot.
Whatever the case, a definite evidentiary trail seems to be clearly laid so
as to give the impression of the dots connecting up. Shukrijumah was also
spotted recently in the Honduras, but I wouldn't give that one much
credence. The Denny's item seems the most likely to be resurrected
post-facto as an example of institutional incompetence and blindess. Perhaps
the Honduras item was meant to give the impression that Shukrijumah was not
yet in the U.S.
In the aftermath of this next one, there will be those who will point to
new instances of incompetence and blindness - who will say that the dots
couldn't be connected. Hopefully, perhaps none of the above will ever come
to pass. Perhaps Shukrijumah, Jdey, and Siddiqui will never make their
"historical" mark - and we've all been treated to nothing more than a
cunningly orchestrated campaign of fear-mongering by the government.
Whatever the case, it seems that a very clear narrative - with accompanying
threads - is being built up for potential use. In the event this particular
chapter of the narrative ever goes "operational" ... well, at least you'll
all know that the mainstream media had put the dots in place beforehand.
In the years since Kupferbergs dead-on prediction, Shukrijumah has indeed
emerged gradually.
Attorney General John Ashcroft labeled Shukrijumah a
clear and present danger in 2004. In 2009, authorities named Shukrijumah
as a co-conspirator in the highly questionable
New York subway bomb plot.
Shukrijumah has over the years been picked up as a cause célèbre by
right-wing hacks such as Michelle Malkin, and the infamous
Gerald Posner,
who has built an entire malodorous career
helping cover-up government crimes
as a favored anti-conspiracy media shill.
There are many reasons for Shukrijumah to explode to official prominence
now.
President Barack Obama has declared an end to combat operations in
Iraq, while maintaining the permanent US military presence in the country
and a continuous anti-terror operation against Al-Qaeda in Iraq. The
administration shift forces to Afghanistan, and continue to ramping up its
long-promised goal of escalating the war on terrorism
throughout
Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc.
With this in the works, along with
congressional mid-term elections looming in the fall, all of Washington,
from the White House and the FBI to the congressional nominees are
refreshing the terrorism pretext.
It should be noted that no analysis was done by the various media organs to
corroborate the details of LeBlancs story before it was repeated verbatim
across the media. LeBlanc has also not been vetted as a credible, unbiased
source.
Whether Shukrijumah is a intelligence legend, a low-level intelligence
asset, or the mastermind that FBI agent LeBlanc claims, the discussion
still collapses when viewed against the backdrop of known historical and
post-9/11 fact. Terrorism is still a red herring.
As amply documented over the years by Michel Chossudovsky and others,
Islamic terrorism, including Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, etc. are assets of
the CIA
a myth designed to obscure a vast covert operation and war plan. The
Militant Islamic Network was created by the CIA, and has continued to
operate on behalf of Anglo-American military-intelligence interests.
Terrorists were key Washington CIA assets
during
the wars in Kosovo, Chechnya, etc. Shukrijumahs boss,
Osama bin Laden is a product of the CIA,
is a military-intelligence asset who may be dead, or a myth.
Covert Action Quarterly featured the following summation box in many of its
post-9/11 issues:
9/11 cover-up continues:
-
Carter administration=CIA-Islamists of Afghanistan
-
Carter administration=CIA=Islamists of Iran
-
al-Qaeda=Saudi=CIA-=Reagan administration collaborations in Afghanistan and
Sudan
-
al-Qaeda=CIA=Clinton administration collaborations in Albania, Algeria,
Bosnia, Chechnya, Iraq, Libya, Sudan
We can now add to this:
Put succinctly by Mike Ruppert in Crossing the Rubicon:
Given the degree of documented intelligence penetration of al Qaeda; the
fact that Osama bin Laden had been a CIA asset during the first Afghan
conflict against the Soviets; the fact that a number of the so-called
hijackers and/or al Qaeda members had been trained in CIA training camps in
Chechnya; had fought in CIA/US-sponsored guerrilla conflicts (e.g. in Kosovo
with the KLA in 2000), or had received military training at US
installations; given all that, it is reasonable to assume that one or more
top al Qaeda officials were in fact double or triple agents.
They worked to
further an agenda originating out of Washington, strongly influenced by Tel
Aviv, rather than out of some ill-defined Muslim hatred of the US. In this
class I would include people like Khalid Sheikh Muhammad (KSM), Ramzi bin
al-Shibh, and Mohammad Atta.
In covert operations, the best kind of an asset is one that has no idea
who is really running him. That is not to say that I dont believe there
are terrorists out there who would do any kind of damage they possibly could
to the United States. Even if there werent any before 9/11 (and there
were), the US has gone out of its way to create animosity against this
country that is in full flower all over the globe.
What is clear is that the
governments assertions that 19 hijackers, funded from caves in Afghanistan,
were able to excecute what happened on September 11th is beyond ludicrous.
It is also that case that the government has never proven to anybody by any
standard other than that used by Randolph Hearst.
What about Shukrijumahs link to the New York subway bomb plot? That
incident has been linked to Jaish-e-Muhammad, a CIA front.
Therefore, any Shukrijumah connection to this event also points to way to the CIA.
It is amusing that a USA Today article about Shukrijumah notes how the hunt
for Al-Qaeda
always comes back to Florida. If the writer of this piece had
truly dug into Floridas long history of covert operations, dirty politics
(the Bushes), narcotrafficking, etc. the writer would not have to ask why.
Investigative journalist
Dan Hopsicker exposed the Florida links to the
so-called 9/11 hijackers, including their military training, and connections
to Floridians with military-intelligence and the Bush family, in a series of
articles, and in the video Mohammad Atta and the Venice Flying Circus. From
a propaganda perspective, placing Shukrijumah into this same framework
simply makes sense, as Kupferberg notes.
According to
Shukrijumah's mother, her son is not a mastermind, but a nice
boy who last contacted her right after 9/11, allegedly from Afghanistan.
If Shukrijumahs radicalization was triggered by 9/11 itself, one could argue
that (assuming that he is a real terrorist) he is yet another by-product of
Bush/Cheneys violence.
The Big Lie redux
Both the Ground Zero mosque and Shukrijumah stories have gone viral. The
noise surrounding both is certain to be even more deafening, even more
outrageous, as election season intensifies, and Obama ramps up its war.
Another anniversary of 9/11 approaches, complete with tear-soaked howling
over the official lies.
The terror threat - perpetual fear of a fabricated outside enemy - is
central to Anglo-American geostrategy. It is being strenuously nurtured.
Insanity continues to prevail.
Al-Qaeda the eternal covert operation and propaganda apparatus, is being
given yet another new boogeymans face. All issues surrounding the 9/11
still set off paroxysms of fear, rage, hatred, and violence, nearly a decade
later.
The militant public embrace of war on terrorism lies underscores how that
the 9/11 false flag operation has succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of the
Anglo-American war criminals who orchestrated it.
The American populace supports the most pernicious 9/11 myths. It is being
played like a fiddle.
It is being run as effectively as any
military-intelligence asset.
