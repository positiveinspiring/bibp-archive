The Governor of Alto Paraguay, Erasmo Rodríguez Acosta has admitted to
hearing that
George Bush Sr. owns land in the Chaco region of Paraguay, in
Paso de Patria.
Acosta says that rumor has it that Bush owns
near to 70 thousand hectares (173,000 acres) as part of an ecological
reserve and/or ranch. However, the governor said he had no documents to
prove the rumor.
Acosta said that some stories credited the land
to the Fundación Patria, which Bush would be a member of. The spokespeople
of the organization were not available to comment.
Supposedly, Timothy Towell , the U.S. Ambassador in Asunción (the capital of Paraguay) is the
present administrator of the land.
First accounts signaled that Bush had acquired
40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) in the Chaco zone of Fuerte Olimpo, near the
Bolivian Border. A spark of the interest in this property may have been
Jenna Bush's private visit to Paraguay with Unicef, which started Saturday,
October 7, 2006.
Supposedly Jenna will travel to the ranch to
"observe" several indigenous villages are located on the property.
The original story from Paraguay, in Spanish, from Prensa Latina that
identifies the purchaser as George W. rather than George H.W. Bush, but the
Chaco purchase strikes me as more likely an initiative of the father than of
the son.
Bush Sr., let's remember, tootled around Latin
America in 1996 as Moon's lapdog and praised him in Buenos Aires as,
"the man
with the vision."
(Moon's foresight might have included blackmail,
specifically the office of the then Vice President with the Craig Spence
call boy scandal. Influence, by any means necessary.)
Still, keeping Moon's company is a Bush family
enterprise, as Neil accompanied the Reverend last year on his 100-day
"global peace campaign."
Paraguay, of course, has been a recent source of alarm to the region for its
allowance of its tri-border territory to become a US military beachhead.
Now, with the reports of the Bush purchase of an "ecological reserve"
alongside Moon's, we have good reason to suspect that US national security
has again been seconded to the Bush family business.
The land which is located somewhere near
Mariscal Estigarribia is near
natural gas reserves, but of more importance. It's near the one of the
largest aquifers in South America.
Argentinean Adolfo Perez Esquivel warned that the real war will be fought
not for oil, but for water, and recalled that
Acuifero Guaraní is one of the
largest underground water reserves in South America, running beneath
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay (larger than Texas and California
together).
He termed it surprising that the Bush family is trying to settle a few
short miles from the US Mariscal Estigarribia Military Base.
Another report notes the land purchase is also nearby a huge tract of land
purchased by Sun Myung Moon that sits astride Latin America's largest water
aquifer, the Guarani aquifer.
According to this report, Bush and
the Carlyle Group are also the owners of
major tracts of land along the
proposed US super-highway linking Mexico and
Canada, land that will be worth hundreds of millions more when the highway
is completed.
Do I need to remind everyone that the Nazi's escaped to South America as
well?
No extradition treaties, no rule, no conscience...
