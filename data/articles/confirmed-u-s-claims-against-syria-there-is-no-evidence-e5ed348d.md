# CONFIRMED: U.S. Claims Against Syria - There is No Evidence

The Wall Street Journal has
confirmed what many suspected, that the West's so-called "evidence"
of the latest alleged "chemical attacks" in Syria, pinned on the
Syrian government are fabrications spun up from the West's
own dubious intelligence agencies.
The Wall Street Journal reveals that the US is citing claims
from Israel's Mossad intelligence agency fed to the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), a repeat of the fabrications that led up
to
the Iraq War,
the Libyan War, and have been used
now for 3 years to justify continued support of extremists operating
within and along Syria's borders.
Wall Street Journal's article, "U.S.,
Allies Prepare to Act as Syria Intelligence Mounts,"
states:
One crucial piece of the emerging
case came from Israeli spy services, which provided the Central
Intelligence Agency with intelligence from inside an elite
special Syrian unit that oversees Mr. Assad's chemical weapons,
Arab diplomats said.
The intelligence, which the CIA was
able to verify, showed that certain types of chemical weapons
were moved in advance to the same Damascus suburbs where the
attack allegedly took place a week ago, Arab diplomats said.
Both Mossad and the CIA are clearly
compromised in terms of objectivity and legitimacy.
Neither exists nor is expected to
provide impartial evidence, but rather to facilitate by all means
necessary the self-serving agendas, interests, and objectives of
their respective governments.
That both
Israel and the United States, as
far back as 2007 have openly conspired together
to overthrow the government of Syria
through a carefully engineered sectarian bloodbath, discredits
entirely their respective intelligence agencies.
This is precisely why an impartial,
objective third-party investigation has been called for by the
international community and agreed upon by the Syrian government - a
third-party investigation the US has now urged to be canceled ahead
of its planned military strikes.
The
Wall Street Journal reports:
In an email on Sunday, White House
National Security Adviser Susan Rice told U.N. Ambassador
Samantha Power and other top officials that the U.N. mission was
pointless because the chemical weapons evidence already was
conclusive, officials said.
The U.S. privately urged the U.N. to
pull the inspectors out, setting the stage for President Barack
Obama to possibly move forward with a military response,
officials said.
The US then, not Syria, is attempting a
cover-up, with fabrications in place from discredited, compromised
intelligence sources and the threat of impending military strikes
that would endanger the UN inspection team's safety should they fail
to end their investigation and withdraw.
The Wall Street Journal also reiterated that the US is planning
to fully sidestep the UN Security Council and proceed with its
partners unilaterally:
...if the U.S. chose to strike, it
would do so with allies and without the U.N., in order to
sidestep an expected Russian veto.
The US proceeds now with absolute
disregard for international law, all but declaring it has no
intention of providing credible evidence of its accusations against
the Syrian government.
It is a rush to war with all the
hallmarks of dangerous desperation as the West's proxy forces
collapse before the Syrian military.
Western military leaders must consider
the strategic tenants and historical examples regarding the dangers
and folly of haste and imprudence in war - especially war fought to
protect special interests and political agendas rather than to
defend territory.
The populations of the West must likewise consider what benefits
they have garnered from the last decade of military conquest their
leaders have indulged in.
Crumbling economies gutted to feed the
preservation of special interests and the growing domestic security
apparatuses to keep these interests safe from both domestic and
foreign dissent are problems that will only grow more acute.
Outside of the West, in Moscow, Beijing, and Tehran, leaders must
consider a future where Western special interests can invade with
impunity, without public support, or even the tenuous semblance of
justification being necessary.
