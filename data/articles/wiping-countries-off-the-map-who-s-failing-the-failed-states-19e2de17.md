Washington is in the "business of
destroying"
a very long list of countries.
Across the world, a dangerous rumor has spread that could
have catastrophic implications. According to legend, Irans
President has threatened to destroy Israel, or, to quote the
misquote, 'Israel must be
wiped off the map'. Contrary to popular belief, this
statement was never made,

Wiped off The Map: The Rumor of the Century

2007
The
United States has attacked, directly or indirectly, some 44
countries throughout the world since August 1945, a
number of them many times. The avowed objective of these
military interventions has been to effect 'regime change'.
The cloaks of 'human rights' and of 'democracy' were
invariably evoked to justify what were unilateral and
illegal acts.
Professor Eric Waddell
The United States Global Military Crusade (1945- )
Global Research, February 2007
This
is a [Pentagon] memo that describes how were going to take
out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and
then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing
off, Iran.
I said, Is it classified?
He said,
Yes, sir.
I said, Well, dont show it to me.

Washington is in the business of destroying a
very long list of countries.
Who is Wiping Countries off the Map? Iran or
the United States?
During a period which is euphemistically called
the post-war era - extending from 1945 to the present - the US has directly
or indirectly attacked more than 40 countries.
While the tenets of US foreign policy are
predicated on the spread of democracy, US interventionism - through
military means and covert operations - has resulted in the outright
destabilization and partition of sovereign nations.
Destroying countries is part of a US
Imperial project, a process of global domination. Moreover, according to
official sources, the US has a total of
737 military bases in foreign countries. (2005 data)
The Notion of Failed
States
The Washington based
National Intelligence Council (NIC) in its Global Trends report (December
2012) predicts that 15 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East
will become failed states by 2030, due to their potential for conflict
and environmental ills.
The list of countries in the 2012 NIC report
includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Mali,
Kenya, Burundi, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, DR Congo, Malawi, Haiti, Yemen.
(see p 39)
In its previous 2005 report, published at the
outset of Bushs second term, the National Intelligence Council had
predicted that Pakistan would become a failed state by 2015 as it will
be affected by civil war, complete Talibanisation and struggle for control
of its nuclear weapons.
Pakistan was compared to Yugoslavia which was
carved up into seven proxy states after a decade of US-NATO sponsored civil
wars.
The NIC forecast for Pakistan was a
Yugoslav-like fate in a,
country raven by civil war, bloodshed and
inter-provincial rivalries.
(Energy Compass, 2 March 2005).
While the failed states are said to serve as
safe-havens for political and religious extremists (p. 143), the report does
not acknowledge the fact that the US and its allies have, since the 1970s,
provided covert support to religious extremist organizations as a means to
destabilize sovereign secular nation states.
Both Pakistan and Afghanistan
were secular states in the 1970s.
A Yugoslav or Somalia-style failed state
status is not the result of internal social divisions, it is a strategic
objective implemented through covert operations and military action.
The Washington based
Fund for Peace, whose mandate is to promote sustainable security
through research, publishes (annually) a Failed States Index based on a
risk assessment (see map below). Thirty three countries (included in the
Alert and Warm categories) are identified as failed states.
According to the
Fund for Peace, the failed states are also targets for Al Qaeda
linked terrorists
The annual ranking of nations by the
Fund for Peace/Foreign
Policy for failing/fragile-state trouble-signs comes as
international alarm grows about al-Qaeda-linked extremists setting up a
state-based sanctuary in northern Mali for jihadi expansion.
Needless to say, the history of Al Qaeda as a US
intelligence asset, its role in creating factional divisions and
instability in the Middle East, Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are not
mentioned.
The activities of the jihadist Al Qaeda units in
most of these countries are part of a diabolical covert intelligence agenda.
Weaker and Failed
States - A Threat to America
In a twist logic, weaker failed states,
according to the US Congress, are said to constitute a threat to the
security of the US.
The latter includes several threats emanating
from states that are variously described as
weak, fragile, vulnerable, failing,
precarious, failed, in crisis, or collapsed.
As the Cold War concluded in the early 1990s,
analysts became aware of an emerging international security environment,
in which weak and failing states became vehicles for transnational organized
crime, nuclear proliferation pathways, and hot spots for civil conflict and
humanitarian emergencies.
The potential U.S. national security threats
weak and failing states pose became further apparent with Al Qaedas
September 11, 2001, attack on the United States,
which Osama bin Laden masterminded from the
safe haven that Afghanistan provided.
The events of 9/11 prompted President
George W.
Bush to claim in the 2002 U.S. National Security Strategy that weak states,
like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our national interests as
strong states.
Weak
and Failing States: Evolving Security, Threats and U.S. Policy
CRS
Report for the US Congress, Washington, 2008
What is not mentioned in this Congressional CRS
report is that the hot spots of organized crime and civilian conflict are
the result of US covert intelligence operations.
Amply documented, the Afghan drug economy which
generates over 90 percent of the Worlds supply of heroin is tied into a
multibillion dollar money laundering operation involving major financial
institutions.
The drug trade out of Afghanistan is protected by the CIA
and US-NATO occupation forces.
Syria - Categorized as a
Failed State
The atrocities committed against the Syrian
population by the US-NATO sponsored Free Syrian Army (FSA) create
conditions which favor sectarian warfare.
Sectarian extremism favors the breakup of Syria
as a Nation State as well as the demise of the central government in
Damascus.
Washingtons foreign policy objective is to
transform Syria into what the National Intelligence Council (NIC) calls a
failed state.
Regime change implies maintaining a central
government. As the Syrian crisis unfolds, the endgame is no longer regime
change but the partition and destruction of Syria as a Nation State.
The US-NATO-Israel strategy is to divide the
country up into three weak states.
Recent media reports intimate that if Bashar Al Assad refuses to step down,
the alternative is a failed state
like Somalia.
One possible break-up scenario
reported by the Israeli press would be the formation of separate and
independent Sunni, Alawite-Shiite, Kurdish and Druze states.
According to Major-General Yair Golan of
Israels IDF,
Syria is in civil war, which will lead to a failed state, and
terrorism will blossom in it.
The Israel Defence Forces are currently
analyzing,
how Syria would break up, according to Major General Golan
(Reuters, May31, 2012)
In November, United Nations peace envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi intimated that Syria could become A New Somalia ,
warning of a scenario in which warlords
and militia fill a void left by a collapsed state.
(Reuters, November 22, 2012)
What I am afraid of is worse
the collapse of
the state and that Syria turns into a new Somalia.
I believe that if this issue is not dealt with
correctly, the danger is Somalisation and not partition: the collapse of
the state and the emergence of warlords, militias and fighting groups.
(Ibid)
What the UN envoy failed to mention is that the
breakup of Somalia, was deliberate.
It was part of a covert US military and
intelligence agenda, which is now being applied to several targeted
countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, which are categorized as
failed states.
The central question is:
The planned break-up of Syria as a sovereign
state is part of an integrated regional military and intelligence agenda
which includes Lebanon, Iran and Pakistan.
According to the predictions of the National
Intelligence Council, the breakup of Pakistan is slated to occur in the
course of the next three years.
The US has
embarked on a military adventure, a long war, which threatens the
future of humanity. US-NATO weapons of mass destruction are portrayed as
instruments of peace. Mini-nukes are said to be harmless to the
surrounding civilian population. Pre-emptive nuclear war is portrayed
as a humanitarian undertaking.
While one
can conceptualize the loss of life and destruction resulting from
present-day wars including Iraq and Afghanistan, it is impossible to
fully comprehend the devastation which might result from a Third World
War, using new technologies and advanced weapons, until it occurs and
becomes a reality. The international community has endorsed nuclear war
in the name of world peace. Making the world safer is the
justification for launching a military operation which could potentially
result in a nuclear holocaust.
Nuclear war
has become a multibillion dollar undertaking, which fills the pockets of
US defense contractors. What is at stake is the outright privatization
of nuclear war.
The
Pentagons global military design is one of world conquest. The military
deployment of US-NATO forces is occurring in several regions of the
world simultaneously.
Central to an
understanding of war, is the media campaign which grants it legitimacy
in the eyes of public opinion. A good versus evil dichotomy prevails.
The perpetrators of war are presented as the victims. Public opinion is
misled.
Breaking the
big lie, which upholds war as a humanitarian undertaking, means
breaking a criminal project of global destruction, in which the quest
for profit is the overriding force. This profit-driven military agenda
destroys human values and transforms people into unconscious zombies.
The
object of this book is to forcefully reverse the tide of war, challenge
the war criminals in high office and the powerful corporate lobby groups
which support them.
