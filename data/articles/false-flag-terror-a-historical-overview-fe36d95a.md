# False Flag Terror - A Historical Overview

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_falseflag34.htm

(1) Japanese troops set off a small
explosion on a train track in 1931, and falsely blamed it on
China in order to justify an invasion of Manchuria.
This is
known as the "Mukden Incident" or the "Manchurian Incident".
The Tokyo International Military
Tribunal
found:
"Several of the participators in
the plan, including Hashimoto [a high-ranking Japanese army
officer], have on various occasions
admitted
their part in the plot and have stated that the object of
the 'Incident' was to afford an excuse for the occupation of
Manchuria by the Kwantung Army
"
And
see this.
(2) A major with the Nazi SS
admitted at the Nuremberg trials that - under orders from
the chief of the Gestapo - he and some other Nazi operatives
faked attacks on their own people and resources which they
blamed on the Poles, to justify the invasion of Poland.
(3) Nazi general Franz Halder also
testified at the Nuremberg trials that Nazi leader Hermann
Goering
admitted to setting fire to the German parliament building
in 1933, and then falsely blaming the communists for the arson.
(4) Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev
admitted in writing that the Soviet Union's Red Army shelled
the Russian village of Manila in 1939 - while blaming the attack
on Finland - as a basis for launching the "Winter War" against
Finland. Russian president Boris Yeltsin
agreed that Russia had been the aggressor in the Winter War.
(5) The Russian Parliament, current
Russian president Putin and former Soviet leader Gorbachev all
admit that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin ordered his secret
police to execute 22,000 Polish army officers and civilians in
1940, and then falsely blamed it on the Nazis.
(6) The British government
admits that - between 1946 and 1948 - it bombed 5 ships
carrying Jews attempting to flee the Holocaust to seek safety in
Palestine, set up a fake group called "Defenders of Arab
Palestine", and then had the pseudo-group falsely claim
responsibility for the bombings (and see
this,
this and
this).
(7) Israel
admits that in 1954, an Israeli terrorist cell operating in
Egypt planted bombs in several buildings, including U.S.
diplomatic facilities, then left behind "evidence" implicating
the Arabs as the culprits (one of the bombs detonated
prematurely, allowing the Egyptians to identify the bombers, and
several of the Israelis later confessed) (and see
this and
this).
(8) The CIA
admits that it hired Iranians in the 1950â€²s to pose as
Communists and stage bombings in Iran in order to turn the
country against its democratically-elected prime minister.
(9) The Turkish Prime Minister
admitted that the Turkish government carried out the 1955
bombing on a Turkish consulate in Greece - also damaging the
nearby birthplace of the founder of modern Turkey - and blamed
it on Greece, for the purpose of inciting and justifying
anti-Greek violence.
(10) The British Prime Minister
admitted to his defense secretary that he and American
president Dwight Eisenhower approved a plan in 1957 to carry out
attacks in Syria and blame it on the Syrian government as a way
to effect regime change.
(11) The former Italian Prime
Minister, an Italian judge, and the
former head of Italian counterintelligence admit that NATO,
with the help of the Pentagon and CIA,
carried out terror bombings in Italy and other European
countries in the 1950s and blamed the communists, in order
to rally people's support for their governments in Europe in
their fight against communism.
As one participant in this
formerly-secret program stated:
"You had to attack civilians,
people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people far
removed from any political game. The reason was quite
simple. They were supposed to force these people, the
Italian public, to turn to the state to ask for greater
security".

and
Source
(Italy and other European countries
subject to the terror campaign had joined NATO before the
bombings occurred). And watch
this BBC special.
They also allegedly carried out
terror attacks in
France, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, the UK, and other countries.
False flag attacks carried out
pursuant to this program include - by way of example only:
(12) In 1960, American Senator
George Smathers
suggested that the U.S. launch "a false attack made on
Guantanamo Bay which would give us the excuse of actually
fomenting a fight which would then give us the excuse to go in
and [overthrow Castro]".
(13) Official State Department
documents show that, in 1961, the head of the Joint Chiefs and
other high-level officials
discussed blowing up a consulate in the Dominican Republic
in order to justify an invasion of that country. The plans were
not carried out, but they were all discussed as serious
proposals.
(14) As admitted by the U.S.
government, recently declassified documents show that in 1962,
the American Joint Chiefs of Staff signed off on a plan to
blow up AMERICAN airplanes
(using an elaborate plan involving the switching of airplanes),
and also to commit
terrorist acts on American soil, and then to blame
it on the Cubans in order to justify an invasion of Cuba.
See the following
ABC news report;
the official documents; and watch
this interview with the former Washington Investigative
Producer for ABC's World News Tonight with Peter Jennings.
(15) In 1963, the U.S. Department of
Defense wrote a paper
promoting attacks on nations within the Organization of
American States - such as Trinidad-Tobago or Jamaica - and then
falsely blaming them on Cuba.
(16) The U.S. Department of Defense
even
suggested covertly paying a person in the Castro government
to attack the United States: "The only area remaining for
consideration then would be to bribe one of Castro's subordinate
commanders to initiate an attack on Guantanamo."
(17) The NSA
admits that it
lied about what really happened in the
Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964
manipulating data to make
it look like North Vietnamese boats fired on a U.S. ship so as
to create a false justification for the Vietnam war.
(18) A U.S. Congressional committee
admitted that - as part of its "Cointelpro"
campaign - the FBI had used many provocateurs in the 1950s
through 1970s to carry out violent acts and falsely blame them
on political activists.
(19) A
top Turkish general
admitted that Turkish forces burned down a mosque on Cyprus
in the 1970s and blamed it on their enemy. He
explained:
"In Special War, certain
acts of sabotage are
staged and blamed on the enemy to increase public
resistance. We did this on Cyprus; we even burnt down a mosque."
In response to the surprised correspondent's incredulous look
the general said,
"I am giving an example".
(20) A
declassified 1973 CIA document
reveals a program to train foreign police and troops on how
to make booby traps, pretending that they were training them on
how to investigate terrorist acts:
The Agency maintains liaison in
varying degrees with foreign police/security organizations
through its field stations...
[CIA provides training sessions
as follows:]
a. Providing trainees with
basic knowledge in the
uses of commercial and military demolitions and
incendiaries as they may be applied in
terrorism and industrial sabotage operations.
b. Introducing the trainees
to commercially
available materials and home laboratory techniques,
likely to he used in the manufacture of explosives and
incendiaries by terrorists or saboteurs.
c. Familiarizing the
trainees with the concept of
target analysis and
operational planning that a saboteur or
terrorist must employ.
d. Introducing the trainees
to booby trapping devices and techniques giving
practical experience with both manufactured and
improvised devices
through actual fabrication.
***
The program provides the
trainees with ample
opportunity to develop basic familiarity and use
proficiently through handling, preparing and applying the
various explosive charges, incendiary agents, terrorist
devices and sabotage techniques.
(21) The German government
admitted (and
see this) that, in 1978, the German secret service detonated
a bomb in the outer wall of a prison and planted "escape tools"
on a prisoner - a member of the Red Army Faction - which the
secret service wished to frame the bombing on.
(22) A Mossad agent
admits that, in 1984, Mossad planted a radio transmitter in
Gaddaffi's compound in Tripoli, Libya which broadcast fake
terrorist trasmissions recorded by Mossad, in order to frame
Gaddaffi as a terrorist supporter. Ronald Reagan bombed Libya
immediately thereafter.
(23) The South African Truth and
Reconciliation Council
found that, in 1989, the Civil Cooperation Bureau (a covert
branch of the South African Defense Force) approached an
explosives expert and asked him,
"to participate in an operation
aimed at discrediting the ANC [the African National
Congress] by bombing the police vehicle of the investigating
officer into the murder incident", thus framing the ANC for
the bombing.
(24) An Algerian diplomat and
several officers in the Algerian army
admit that, in the 1990s, the Algerian army frequently
massacred Algerian civilians and then blamed Islamic militants
for the killings (and see
this video; and Agence France-Presse, 9/27/2002, French
Court Dismisses Algerian Defamation Suit Against Author).
(25) The United States Army's 1994
publication Special Forces Foreign Internal Defense Tactics
Techniques and Procedures for Special Forces - updated in
2004 -
recommends employing terrorists and using false flag
operations to destabilize leftist regimes in Latin America.
False flag terrorist attacks were carried out in Latin America
and other regions as part of the CIA's "Dirty
Wars". And
see this.
(26) Similarly, a CIA "psychological
operations" manual prepared by a CIA contractor for the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels
noted the value of assassinating someone on your own side to
create a "martyr" for the cause.
The manual was
authenticated by the U.S. government.
The manual received so much
publicity from Associated Press, Washington Post and other news
coverage that - during the 1984 presidential debate - President
Reagan was
confronted with the following question on national
television:
At this moment, we are
confronted with the extraordinary story of a CIA guerrilla
manual for the anti-Sandinista contras whom we are backing,
which advocates not only assassinations of Sandinistas but
the
hiring of criminals to assassinate the guerrillas we are
supporting in order to create martyrs.
(27) An Indonesian fact-finding team
investigated violent riots which occurred in 1998, and
determined that "elements
of the military had been involved in the riots, some of which
were deliberately provoked".
(28) Senior Russian Senior military
and intelligence officers
admit that the KGB blew up Russian apartment buildings in
1999 and falsely blamed it on Chechens, in order to justify an
invasion of Chechnya (and see
this report and
this discussion).
(29) As reported by
BBC, the
New York Times, and
Associated Press, Macedonian officials admit that the
government murdered 7 innocent immigrants in cold blood and
pretended that they were Al Qaeda soldiers attempting to
assassinate Macedonian police, in order to join the "war on
terror".
(30) At the July 2001 G8 Summit in
Genoa, Italy, black-clad thugs were
videotaped getting out of police cars, and were
seen by an Italian MP,
"carrying iron bars inside the police
station".
Subsequently, senior police
officials in Genoa subsequently
admitted that police planted two Molotov cocktails and faked
the stabbing of a police officer at the G8 Summit, in order to
justify a
violent crackdown against protesters.
(31) The U.S.
falsely blamed Iraq for playing a role in the 9/11 attacks -
as shown by a
memo from the defense secretary - as one of the
main justifications for launching the Iraq war.
Even after the 9/11 Commission
admitted that there was no connection, Dick Cheney
said that the evidence is "overwhelming" that al Qaeda had a
relationship with Saddam Hussein's regime, that Cheney
"probably" had information unavailable to the Commission, and
that the media was not 'doing their homework' in reporting such
ties.
Top U.S. government officials
now
admit that the Iraq war was really launched for oil
not
9/11 or weapons of mass destruction. Despite previous "lone
wolf" claims, many U.S. government officials now
say that 9/11 was state-sponsored terror; but Iraq was
not the state which backed the hijackers.
(Many U.S. officials have
alleged that 9/11 was a false flag operation by rogue
elements of the U.S. government; but such a claim is beyond the
scope of this discussion. The key point is that the U.S. falsely
blamed it on Iraq, when it knew Iraq had nothing to do
with it.).
(32) Although the FBI now admits
that the 2001 anthrax attacks were carried out by one or more
U.S. government scientists, a senior FBI official says that the
FBI was actually
told to blame the Anthrax attacks on Al Qaeda by White
House officials (remember what the anthrax letters
looked like).
Government officials also confirm
that the white House
tried to link the anthrax to Iraq as a justification for
regime change in that country.
(33) According to the
Washington Post, Indonesian police admit that the Indonesian
military killed American teachers in Papua in 2002 and blamed
the murders on a Papuan separatist group in order to get that
group listed as a terrorist organization.
(34) The well-respected former
Indonesian president also
admits that the government probably had a role in the Bali
bombings.
(35) Police outside of a 2003
European Union summit in Greece were filmed
planting Molotov cocktails on a peaceful
protester
(36) Former Department of Justice
lawyer John Yoo
suggested in 2005 that the US should go on the offensive
against al-Qaeda, having "our intelligence agencies create a
false terrorist organization.
It could have its own websites, recruitment centers, training
camps, and fundraising operations.
It could
launch
fake terrorist operations
and claim credit for real terrorist strikes, helping to sow
confusion within al-Qaeda's ranks, causing operatives to doubt
others' identities and to question the validity of
communications."
(37) Similarly, in 2005, Professor
John Arquilla of the Naval Postgraduate School - a
renowned US defense analyst credited with developing the concept
of 'netwar' -
called for western intelligence services to
create new "pseudo gang" terrorist groups, as a way of
undermining "real" terror networks.
According to Pulitzer-Prize winning
journalist Seymour Hersh, Arquilla's 'pseudo-gang'
strategy was, Hersh reported,
already being implemented by the Pentagon:
"Under Rumsfeld's new approach,
I was told, US military operatives would be permitted to
pose abroad as corrupt foreign businessmen seeking to buy
contraband items that could be used in nuclear-weapons
systems. In some cases, according to the Pentagon advisers,
local citizens could be
recruited and asked to join up with guerrillas or terrorists
The new rules will enable
the Special Forces community to set up what it calls 'action
teams' in the target countries overseas which can be used to
find and eliminate terrorist organizations.
'Do you remember the right-wing execution
squads in El Salvador?' the former high-level
intelligence official asked me, referring to the
military-led gangs that committed atrocities in the
early nineteen-eighties.
'We founded them and we financed them,'
he said. 'The objective now is to recruit locals in any
area we want. And we aren't going to tell Congress about
it.'
A former military officer, who has knowledge
of the Pentagon's commando capabilities, said,
'We're going to be riding with the bad
boys.'"
(38) United Press International
reported in June 2005:
U.S. intelligence officers are
reporting that some of the insurgents in Iraq are using
recent-model Beretta 92 pistols, but the pistols seem to
have had their serial numbers erased.
The numbers do not appear to
have been physically removed; the pistols seem to have come
off a production line without any serial numbers.
Analysts suggest the lack of
serial numbers indicates that the weapons were intended for
intelligence operations or terrorist cells with substantial
government backing. Analysts speculate that these guns are
probably from either Mossad or the CIA.
Analysts speculate that agent
provocateurs may be using the untraceable weapons even as
U.S. authorities use insurgent attacks against civilians as
evidence of the illegitimacy of the resistance.
(39) Undercover Israeli soldiers
admitted in 2005 to throwing stones at other Israeli
soldiers so they could blame it on Palestinians, as an excuse to
crack down on peaceful protests by the Palestinians.
(40) Quebec police
admitted that, in 2007, thugs carrying rocks to a peaceful
protest were actually undercover Quebec police officers (and
see this).
(41) A 2008 US Army special
operations field manual
recommends that the U.S. military use surrogate non-state
groups such as,
"paramilitary forces,
individuals, businesses, foreign political organizations,
resistant or insurgent organizations, expatriates,
transnational terrorism
adversaries, disillusioned transnational terrorism members,
black marketers, and other social or political
'undesirables'."
The manual specifically acknowledged
that U.S. special operations can involve both counterterrorism
and "Terrorism" (as well as "transnational criminal activities,
including narco-trafficking, illicit arms-dealing, and illegal
financial transactions.")
(42) The former head of Secret
Services and Head of State of Italy (Francesco Cossiga)
advised the 2008 minister in charge of the police, on how to
deal with protests from teachers and students:
He should do what I did when I
was Minister of the Interior
infiltrate the movement with
agents provocateurs inclined to do anything...
And after that, with the
strength of the gained population consent
beat them for
blood and beat for blood also those teachers that incite
them. Especially the teachers.
Not the elderly, of course, but
the girl teachers yes.
(43) At the G20 protests in London
in 2009, a British member of parliament
saw plain clothes police officers attempting to incite the
crowd to violence.
(44) Egyptian politicians
admitted (and
see this) that government employees looted priceless museum
artifacts in 2011 to try to discredit the protesters.
(45) Rioters who discredited the
peaceful protests against the swearing in of the Mexican
president in 2012
admitted that they were paid 300 pesos each to destroy
everything in their path. According to Wikipedia, photos also
show the vandals waiting in groups behind police lines prior
to the violence.
(46) A Colombian army colonel has
admitted that his unit murdered 57 civilians, then dressed
them in uniforms and claimed they were rebels killed in combat.
(47) On November 20, 2014, Mexican
agent provocateurs were transported by army vehicles to
participate in the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping protests, as was
shown by videos and pictures distributed via social
networks.
(48) The highly-respected writer for
the Telegraph Ambrose Evans-Pritchard says that the head of
Saudi intelligence - Prince Bandar - recently
admitted that the Saudi government controls "Chechen"
terrorists.
(49) High-level American sources
admitted that the Turkish government - a fellow NATO country
- carried out the chemical weapons attacks blamed on the Syrian
government; and high-ranking Turkish government
admitted on tape plans to carry out attacks and blame it on
the Syrian government.
(50) The Ukrainian security chief
admits that the sniper attacks which started the Ukrainian
coup were carried out in order to frame others. Ukrainian
officials
admit that the Ukrainian snipers fired on both sides, to
create maximum chaos.
And a Maidan protester admitted
that he fired a sniper rifle at police from the Conservatory,
and that he was guided by a military veteran within the Maidan
resistance.
(51) Britain's spy agency has
admitted (and
see this) that it carries out "digital false flag" attacks
on targets,
framing people by writing offensive or unlawful material
and blaming it on the target.
(52) U.S. soldiers have
admitted that if they kill innocent Iraqis and Afghanis,
they then "drop" automatic weapons near their body so they can
pretend they were militants
(53) Similarly, police frame
innocent people for crimes they didn't commit. The practice is
so well-known that the New York Times
noted in 1981:
In police jargon, a throwdown is
a weapon planted on a victim.
Newsweek
reported in 1999:
Perez, himself a former [Los
Angeles Police Department] cop, was caught stealing eight
pounds of cocaine from police evidence lockers.
After pleading guilty in
September, he bargained for a lighter sentence by telling an
appalling story of attempted murder and a
"throwdown" - police slang
for a weapon planted by cops to make a shooting legally
justifiable.
Perez said he and his partner,
Officer Nino Durden, shot an unarmed 18th Street Gang member
named Javier Ovando, then
planted a semiautomatic rifle on the unconscious suspect and
claimed that Ovando had tried to shoot them during
a stakeout.
Wikipedia
notes:
As part of his plea bargain,
PÃ©rez implicated scores of officers from the Rampart
Division's anti-gang unit, describing routinely
beating gang members, planting evidence on suspects,
falsifying reports and covering up unprovoked shootings.
(As a side note - and while not
technically false flag attacks - police have been busted
framing innocent people in many other ways, as well.)
(54) A former U.S. intelligence
officer recently
alleged:
Most terrorists are false flag
terrorists or are created by our own security services.
(55) The head and special agent in
charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office
said that most terror attacks are committed by the CIA and
FBI as false flags.
Similarly, the director of the
National Security Agency under Ronald Reagan - Lt. General
William Odom
said:
By any measure the US has long
used terrorism. In '78-79 the Senate was trying to pass a
law against international terrorism - in every version they
produced, the lawyers said the US would be in violation.
(audio
here).
(56) Leaders throughout history have
acknowledged the "benefits" of of false flags to justify their
political agenda:
"Terrorism
is the best political weapon for nothing drives
people harder than a fear of sudden death".
Adolph Hitler
"Why of course the people don't
want war
But after all it is the leaders of the country who
determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to
drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a
fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist
dictatorship
Voice or no voice, the people can always be
brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you
have to do is to tell them
they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists
for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.
It works the same in any country."
Hermann Goering,
Nazi leader.
"The easiest way to gain control
of a population is to carry
out acts of terror. [The public] will clamor for
such laws if their personal security is threatened".
Josef Stalin
