# The Soros Master Plan

-
Work to have Hillary become the Democratic nominee.
It is clear
from Wikileaks that Hillary's team worked with both
Soros and his many organizations, including his media organizations.
Working with Hillary increases her trust in the Soros machine. In
this she is depending on Soros and his organizations to help her be
elected.
Throughout the primary and the election Hillary and her
team become convinced she will win with the Soros machine on her
side.
Strive to cause doubt and in the credibility of the democratic
process. Stealing the vote and conniving to take the nomination with
underhanded tactics achieves this magnificently. DNC alignment
against Bernie was revealed by the DNC leaks and Podesta emails.
These leaks only served to solidify the belief of many that the
Democrat primary was not fair. And in this process many on the left
become suspicious of the election process (critical feature to the
plan as stated above).
Were the leaks released by a Soros operative
for these purposes?
-
Wait for Republicans, some of whom may or may not be working with
Soros organizations, to decide their nominee. No need to interfere
at this point. Trump ended up being the nominee.
It is possible that Soros et al worked to get Trump elected, but I
do not see or have evidence of this. More importantly, it doesn't
matter to the plan who the Republican nominee was.
-
After Hillary and Trump are declared the candidates, craft the
details of the future plan.
-
In the months leading up to the election, use Soros media and
Soros politicians to promote a few main narratives.
Repeat these
narratives in every media form until they are "common knowledge":
-
"Hillary will win
easily. It is impossible for Trump to win."
-
"Trump is evil, racist,
and bigoted. He is dangerous. No one could like him
and still be a sane or good person."
-
"Russia and Trump are
working together. Russia will probably influence the
election for Trump and maybe try to help him steal
it in some way (hacking)."
-
Use every resource available to convince the public of these three
simple narratives.
This was achieved with mass media, news organizations, opinion
polls, celebrities, politicians, and the Hillary campaign. These
narratives are extremely obvious to any observer.
-
During the election period another plot was put in place, in
addition to the narratives. This was the development of widespread
distrust in government institutions. In particular create distrust
of law enforcement, the legal system, and the voting system.
Black lives matter: this was funded by Soros and driven by his
operatives. The media backed it up with sensationalism and skewed
perspective. The primary goal was to cause doubt in the legitimacy
of police and the legal system.
The primary target was left leaning
people.
Those not captured by the BLM "movement" are instead captured by
the blatant lawbreaking of
the Clintons. The
email scandal and Wikileaks revealed many broken laws
and yet Clinton was not
punished.
This came to a defining peak when
(James)
Comey "inexplicably"
went back and forth on the Weiner emails.
It all seemed so strange,
didn't it?
But what was the ultimate result? A severe doubt in the
rule of law at the federal level. This captured nearly all
Americans. Those on the left suspected Comey was influencing the
election for Trump and resent him for that; those on the right see
clear lawbreaking and injustice when no indictment has appeared.
In
the end, the purpose was served: widespread doubt about the legal
system in the US.
The Democratic primary, and the subsequent DNC leaks that revealed
how they were rigged, established for the left wing an extreme
distrust of the election process.
The covert and overt efforts of Soros organizations to use
agitators in the election was evident in many cases.
Project Veritas
explicitly revealed their efforts to rig the election through
several investigations. This campaign by agitators in the Soros
groups caused those in the right wing to distrust the election
process.
Leading up to the election the groundwork was in place. The
narratives were solid in the psyche of the public and the Hillary
campaign.
Additionally, distrust of government legal structures
(enforcement and justice system) and distrust of election integrity
was entrenched in the mind of the population. Now let's follow the
plan through election day.
-
Make sure Trump wins the election.
If it happens on its own, great. If not use the
"compromised"
Soros voting machines and voter fraud techniques to make sure it
does happen.
-
The election results shock the public and shock Hillary and her
team. The constant narrative of "It is impossible for Trump to win"
leads to shock when he wins.
-
Keep in mind it is likely the Hillary campaign and the Soros media
were expecting his resources to win this election.
It was evident on
election night that the Hillary campaign and the media were hesitant
to call the election over, even though it seemed as it was to anyone
looking at the reported returns.
In particular there was significant
delay in "calling" Pennsylvania and Michigan for Trump. It must be
noted here that Soros voting machines were used in Pennsylvania and
Michigan. I propose the media and the Hillary campaign were waiting
for Soros to "save the day".
But he didn't. This caused both of them
shock.
-
The day after the election send out the agitators to stage
protests. Have the media express shock and outrage. Use this to
cause discomfort and anger in the public and media.
This is where, as in BLM, the agitators of the Soros organizations
come into play. Their job is to create mayhem and environments that
allow the expression of feelings.
The expression of feelings at
protests and riots allows the media to move the story forward.
-
The media and public will then ask the question: How did this
happen? Why is everyone so angry and upset?
It is at this point that
the narrative that was build over months comes into play. Everyone
is led "logically" to the conclusion that the vote must have been
rigged or stolen. For, here are the facts that we think we know: It
was impossible for Trump to win and Trump is evil.
Therefore, he
must have stolen the election somehow.
Mixed into this the media will propose a potential solution: the
Electoral College is to blame. The argument will be put forward that
the Electoral College structure caused this political mess.
The left
will lash out at the Electoral College.
-
It is at this point the third piece of the narrative will come
into play.
Someone will produce "evidence" that Trump stole the
election and the Russians were behind it. This evidence can be
manufactured using the Soros voting machines that infiltrated the
voting process. The third narrative has now served its purpose
(Trump and Russia are working together to influence the election).
Consider that the presence of Soros owned voting machines might
not be to win elections. Instead, consider that the primary goal of
Soros in revolutions is to cause an ELECTION CRISIS. So, it is
likely that he became infiltrated the voting process to undermine
the voting process.
Was the election rigged to have Trump win? I do
not know.
Did Trump win and could evidence be easily produced to
accuse him of stealing the vote? Certainly. In this process Trump
becomes trapped; he is the patsy.
-
Use this "evidence" of election theft to vilify Trump. Create
extreme hate for Trump and "what he did." Lump Russia into it also;
conveniently, this fits the narrative established in the lead up to
the election.
Wrapped up into this is Russia. As it turns out Russia and Soros
are sort of arch-enemies.
In one grand plan Soros is laying the
groundwork to undermine the US and also disrupt US-Russia relations.
Ideally, for him, this disruption leads to war with Putin and
Russia.
-
Use the "evidence" and widespread hate/disgust with the entire
event to convince the Electoral College electors to elect Hillary
instead of Trump.
The Electoral College meets in December to
"vote" for the
president. Legally, there is not a president-elect until this
meeting in December occurs.
This is where Hillary and the Soros media realize that Soros has
played a master hand. She is indebted to him as she heads into
office.
-
At this point the right is extremely angry and frustrated with
what has happened to Trump. They suspect foul play; they suspect the
federal government and the election process.
Maybe they riot, maybe they do nothing. Their response does not
matter, so long as they are outraged and feel like it is all a big
mess.
-
The inevitable solution provided by the government. Leadership
might be spearheaded by Obama, but it could also be led by a
President Hillary in January.
The goal will be to "clean up this
election nonsense" for the good of the country. First will be the
proposal that we must "fix the electoral college system so that this
never happens again."
This will be the alibi for dramatic change to
the US structures of democracy and government.
The Electoral College system will become the scapegoat for all
parties involved. The left, the right, the government, and Soros
will all call for a change to its structure. This will allow for a
driving force to change the system.
-
Amazingly and predictably, a "cookbook" or
"bill" or "proposal"
will already be ready-to-go in government circles.
In it will be
changes to the Electoral College system. But, in addition to those
changes, other structural changes will be pushed through as a
"package".
Again, the Electoral College system will be the scapegoat. But out
of this process other initiatives and structural changes will be
introduced into the American democracy. This is that same old
stance: "Never let a crisis go to waste."
-
And it is here, in the new ideas that are adopted by the US that
the revolution reaches its climax.
The structural changes in the
"cookbook" that are adopted will have been carefully crafted to lead
to the fruition and reality of Soros' ideas for globalism and one
world government.
