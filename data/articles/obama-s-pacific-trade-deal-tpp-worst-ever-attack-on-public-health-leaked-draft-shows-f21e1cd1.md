Wikileaks publishes draft chapter
of closed-door negotiations
as White House seeks to fast-track
agreement
Legal experts say U.S.
conditions in TPP would erode access
to life-saving medicines in
Pacific-Rim countries.
Secret documents published Wednesday expose the
Obama administration's closed-door efforts to slash internet freedoms and
erode access to medicines in the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership through a
series of proposals that analysts say are the most damaging and dangerous in
the history of U.S. "free trade" deals.
"The Obama administrations proposals are
the worst - the most damaging for health - we have seen in a U.S. trade
agreement to date,"
said Peter Maybarduk, director of Public Citizens global access to
medicines program.
"The Obama administration has backtracked
from even the modest health considerations adopted under the Bush
administration."
A secret 94-page draft chapter on intellectual
property negotiations,
published by Wikileaks, provides a snap-shot of the secret
19th round of negotiations that took place in the country of Brunei in
late August.
While the TPP negotiations
started
in 2008 and the agreement is poised to be the largest U.S. trade deal
ever, this is the first time the public has had access to any draft of this
chapter.
Legal experts say the document reveals a U.S.
effort to champion the demands of the pharmaceutical industry by pushing to
reduce the ability of countries to invoke public health to override patents,
even in cases where this would make life-saving medicines more affordable
and accessible.
"The Obama administrations shameful
bullying on behalf of the giant drug companies would lead to preventable
suffering and death in Asia-Pacific countries,"
said Maybarduk.
"And soon the administration is expected to
propose additional TPP terms that would lock Americans into high prices
for cancer drugs for years to come."
Experts also say the chapter shows an Obama
administration taking aim at internet freedoms.
"The WikiLeaks text also features Hollywood
and recording industry-inspired proposals - think about the SOPA debacle
- to limit Internet freedom and access to educational materials, to
force Internet providers to act as copyright enforcers and to cut off
peoples Internet access," said Burcu Kilic, an intellectual property
lawyer with Public Citizen.
"These proposals are deeply unpopular
worldwide and have led to a negotiation stalemate."
"The longest section of the Chapter -
'Enforcement' - is devoted to detailing new policing measures, with
far-reaching implications for individual rights, civil liberties,
publishers, internet service providers and internet privacy, as well as
for the creative, intellectual, biological and environmental commons,"
reads a
statement released by Wikileaks.
The Obama administration has so far refused to
release drafts of the negotiated text, and so far the bulk of public
information about the deal comes from fragmented and limited leaks.
Previous documents show negotiators are pushing
to include NAFTA-like
corporate tribunals that allow multinational companies to circumvent
national legal systems and domestic protections of the environment and
public health by settling with governments in secret courts.
The parties to the agreement - Australia, the
US, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Chile, New
Zealand, and Singapore - collectively comprise
nearly 40 percent of the world's GDP. Excluding China, the agreement
appears to be in step with the U.S.
military pivot to Asia in a bid to hedge against China's rising power.
The revelations come ahead of the
TPP Chief Negotiators' summit in
Salt Lake City, Utah later this month and in the midst of a White House
bid to fast-track the agreement, details of which have been kept from
both the U.S. public and
elected
lawmakers.
