We Are Not Afraid
September 7, 2009
We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts,
foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation
that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an
open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.
- President John F. Kennedy
February 26, 1962
"If we act like cowards we will be treated like cowards."

pulverized World Trade Center
Eight years have passed since the terror atrocities of September 11,
2001, heinous false-flag terror crimes which took the lives of thousands
of innocent people and led to drastic changes in the United States and
around the world.
Although the terror attacks have yet to be properly
investigated and prosecuted by the federal government, we now have
scientific evidence that proves that the official explanation is nothing
but a pack of lies, a massive deception foisted on the public by corrupt
government officials and the controlled media. Most significantly, this
deception was promoted by officials and media owners who knew it to be
false.
The U.S. Department of Justice, for example, oversaw the
destruction of many tons of structural steel - crucial evidence from the
crime scenes.
On one hand, the government and media have intentionally pushed a
fabrication that a band of Islamic terrorists hijacked airplanes and
flew them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, causing the
complete destruction and pulverization of two 110-story towers and a
47-story building in lower Manhattan.
Using this deception, the federal
government and its agents have created a police state in the United
States and forced Americans and other Western nations to participate in
an utterly fraudulent "War on Terror," waging illegal wars of aggression
and occupation in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. Untold
thousands have died in these illegal wars of aggression.
On the other hand, we have scientific evidence that the Twin Towers were
blown up with an advanced form of super-thermite, chips of which were
found in five different samples of the dust from the demolished towers
by Dr. Steven E. Jones of Brigham Young University.
This crucial
discovery, published as a peer-reviewed paper in March 2009 with other
scientists, completely disproves the official version that the Twin
Towers fell as a result of fires caused by the plane crashes. This
discovery also explains the explosive destruction and pulverization of
the immense steel-frame and concrete buildings.
As Professor Jones says,
"The data doesn't lie."
Rather than addressing the evidence that the World Trade Center was
demolished with explosives, however, the new administration of President
Barack Obama
continues to use the 9-11 deception to increase the war
effort in Afghanistan, occupying a nation that had nothing to do with
the terror attacks in the United States.
Neither
Osama Bin Laden nor the Taliban had
anything to do with the demolition of the World Trade Center, which the
evidence proves was carried out using an advanced form of Thermite
created using nano-technology. Nor did the airplane crashes themselves
cause the towers to collapse. The plane crashes were merely part of the
deception, meant to provide a plausible explanation for the pre-planned
explosive demolitions that followed.
This is why 2009 is such a crucial year for 9-11 truth.
A modern
republic like the United States cannot continue for very long as a free
nation with a government and media that lie to the people about the
murder of thousands of its citizens and illegal wars supposedly waged on
their behalf. This is clearly a state in the process of a revolutionary
change.
The American people will not tolerate a police state using such
outrageous lies to rob them of their money and freedom.
"We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant
facts," President John F. Kennedy said in 1962. "For a nation that is
afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market
is a nation that is afraid of its people."
So, who is really afraid of
unpleasant facts and the truth of 9-11? It is not the people, but the
culprits of the terror atrocity and the subsequent cover-up who fear the
truth.
My work provides some of the unpleasant but essential facts about 9-11.
It represents eight years of work and is dedicated to the truth and the
people who died on that day.
It is unacceptable that their deaths, and
the suffering of their families, have been exploited to deceive the
world and wage illegal wars.
