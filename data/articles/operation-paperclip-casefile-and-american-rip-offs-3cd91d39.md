After WWII ended in 1945, victorious Russian and
American intelligence teams began a treasure hunt throughout occupied
Germany for military and scientific booty.
They were looking for things like
new rocket and aircraft designs, medicines, and electronics. But they were
also hunting down the most precious "spoils" of all: the scientists whose
work had nearly won the war for Germany. The engineers and intelligence
officers of the Nazi War Machine.
The U.S. Military rounded up Nazi scientists and brought them to America. It
had originally intended merely to debrief them and send them back to
Germany. But when it realized the extent of the scientists knowledge and
expertise, the War Department decided it would be a waste to send the
scientists home.
Following the
discovery of flying discs (foo fighters),
particle/laser beam weaponry in German military bases, the War Department
decided that NASA and the CIA must control this technology, and the Nazi
engineers that had worked on this technology.
There was only one problem: it was illegal. U.S. law explicitly prohibited
Nazi officials from immigrating to America--and as many as three-quarters of
the scientists in question had been committed Nazis.
Convinced that German scientists could help America's postwar efforts,
President Harry Truman agreed in September 1946 to authorize "Project
Paperclip," a program to bring selected German scientists to work on
America's behalf during the "Cold War"
However, Truman expressly excluded anyone found,
"to have been a member of
the Nazi party and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an
active supporter of Naziism or militarism."
The War Department's Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) conducted
background investigations of the scientists. In February 1947, JIOA Director
Bosquet Wev submitted the first set of scientists' dossiers to the
State and Justice Departments for review.
The Dossiers were damning. Samauel Klaus, the State Departments
representative on the JIOA board, claimed that all the scientists in this
first batch were "ardent Nazis." Their visa requests were denied.
Wev was furious. He wrote a memo warning that,
"the best interests of the United States
have been subjugated to the efforts expended in 'beating a dead Nazi
horse.'"
He also declared that the return of these
scientists to Germany, where they could be exploited by America's enemies,
presented a "far greater security threat to this country than any former
Nazi affiliations which they may have had or even any Nazi sympathies that
they may still have."
When the JIOA formed to investigate the backgrounds and form dossiers on
the Nazis, the Nazi Intelligence leader Reinhard Gehlen met with the
CIA
director Allen Dulles. Dulles and Gehlen hit it off immediately. Gehlen was
a master spy for the Nazis and had infiltrated Russia with his vast Nazi
Intelligence network.
Dulles promised Gehlen that his Intelligence unit was
safe in the CIA.
Apparently, Wev decided to sidestep the problem. Dulles had the scientists
dossier's re-written to eliminate incriminating evidence. As promised, Allen
Dulles delivered the Nazi Intelligence unit to the CIA, which later opened
many umbrella projects stemming from Nazi mad research. (MK-ULTRA /
ARTICHOKE, OPERATION MIDNIGHT CLIMAX)
Military Intelligence "cleansed" the files of Nazi references. By 1955, more
than 760 German scientists had been granted citizenship in the U.S. and
given prominent positions in the American scientific community. Many had
been longtime members of the Nazi party and the Gestapo, had conducted
experiments on humans at concentration camps, had used slave labor, and had
committed other war crimes.
In a 1985 expose in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Linda Hunt wrote
that she had examined more than 130 reports on Project Paperclip
subjects--and every one "had been changed to eliminate the security threat
classification."
President Truman, who had explicitly ordered no committed Nazis to be
admitted under Project Paperclip, was evidently never aware that his
directive had been violated. State Department archives and the memoirs of
officials from that era confirm this. In fact, according to Clare Lasby's
book Operation Paperclip, project officials "covered their designs with such
secrecy that it bedeviled their own President; at Potsdam he denied their
activities and undoubtedly enhanced Russian suspicion and distrust," quite
possibly fueling the Cold War even further.
A good example of how these dossiers were changed is the case of Wernher
von Braun. A September 18, 1947, report on the German rocket scientist
stated,
"Subject is regarded as a potential security threat by the Military
Governor."
The following February, a new security evaluation of Von Braun said,
"No derogatory information is available on
the subject...It is the opinion of the Military Governor that he may not
constitute a security threat to the United States."
Here are a few of the 700 suspicious characters
who were allowed to immigrate through Project Paperclip.
ARTHUR RUDOLPH
During the war, Rudolph was operations
director of the Mittelwerk factory at the Dora-Nordhausen concentration
camps, where 20,000 workers died from beatings, hangings, and
starvation.
Rudolph had been a member of the Nazi party since 1931; a
1945 military file on him said simply:
"100% Nazi, dangerous type,
security threat..!! Suggest internment."
But the JIOA's final dossier on him said there was "nothing in his
records indicating that he was a war criminal or and ardent Nazi or
otherwise objectionable." Rudolph became a US citizen and later designed
the Saturn 5 rocket used in the Apollo moon landings.
In 1984, when his
war record was finally investigated, he fled to West Germany.
WERNHER VON BRAUN
From 1937 to 1945, von Braun was the
technical director of the Peenemünde rocket research center, where the
V-2 rocket - which devastated England - was developed. As noted
previously, his dossier was rewritten so he didn't appear tohave been an
enthusiastic Nazi.
Von Braun worked on guided missiles for the U.S. Army and was later
director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. He became a celebrity
in the 1950s and early 1960s, as one of Walt Disney's experts on the
"World of Tomorrow."
In 1970, he became NASA's associate administrator.
KURT BLOME
A high-ranking Nazi scientist, Blome told
U.S. military interrogators in 1945 that he had been ordered 1943 to
experiment with plague vaccines on concentration camp prisoners. He was
tried at Nuremberg in 1947 on charges of practicing euthanasia
(extermination of sick prisoners), and conducting experiments on
humans. Although acquitted, his earlier admissions were well known, and
it was generally accepted that he had indeed participated in the
gruesome experiments.
Two months after his Nuremberg acquittal, Blome was interviewed at Camp
David, Maryland, about biological warfare. In 1951, he was hired by the
U.S. Army Chemical Corps to work on chemical warfare.
His file
neglected to mention Nuremberg.
MAJOR GENERAL WALTER SCHREIBER
According to Linda Hunt's article, the US
military tribunal at Nuremberg heard evidence that,
"Schreiber had
assigned doctors to experiment on concentration camp prisoners and had
made funds available for such experimentation."
The assistant prosecutor
said the evidence would have convicted Schreiber if the Soviets, who
held him from 1945 to 1948, had made him available for trial.
Again, Schreiber's Paperclip file made no mention of this evidence; the
project found work for him at the Air Force School of Medicine at
Randolph Field in Texas. When columnist Drew Pearson publicized the
Nuremberg evidence in 1952, the negative publicity led the JIOA, says
Hunt, to arrange "a visa and a job for Schreiber in Argentina, where his
daughter was living."
On May 22, 1952, he was flown to Buenos Aires.
HERMANN BECKER-FREYSING and SIEGFRIED RUFF
These two, along with Blome, were among the
23 defendants in the Nuremberg War Trials "Medical Case." Becker-Freysing
was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for conducting
experiments on Dachau inmates, such as starving them, then
force-feeding them seawater that had been chemically altered to make it
drinkable. Ruff was acquitted (in a close decision) on charges that he
had killed as many as 80 Dachau inmates in a low-pressure chamber
designed to simulate altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet.
Before their trial, Becker-Freysing and Ruff
were paid by the Army Air Force to write reports about their grotesque
experiments.
GENERAL REINHARD GEHLEN
It was five years after the end of WW2 but
one of Hitler's chief intelligence officers was still on the job. From
a walled-in compound in Bavaria, General Reinhard Gehlen oversaw a vast
network of intelligence agents spying on Russia. His top aides were
Nazi zealots who had committed some of the most notorious crimes of the
war. Gehlen and his SS united were hired, and swiftly became agents of
the CIA when they revealed their massive records on the Soviet Union to
the US.
Gehlen derived much of his information from his role in one of the most
terrible atrocities of the war: the torture, interrogation and murder by
starvation of some four million Soviet prisoners. Prisoners who refused
to cooperate were often tortured or summarily executed. May were
executed even after they had given information, while others were simply
left to starve to death. As a result, Gehlen and members of his
organization maneuvered to make sure they were captured by advancing
American troops rather than Russians, who would have executed them
immediately.
Two months before Germany surrendered in 1945, the Gehlen organization
made its move. Gehlen and a small group of his most senior officers
carefully microfilmed the vast holding on the USSR in the military
section of the German army's general staff. They packed the film in
watertight steel drums and secretly buried it in a remote mountain
meadow scattered throughout the Austrian Alps.
General William Donovan and Allen Dulles of the CIA were tipped off
about Gehlen's surrender and his offer of Russian intelligence in
exchange for a job. The CIA was soon jockeying with military
intelligence for authority over Gehlen's microfilmed records--and
control of the German spymaster. Dulles arranged for a private
intelligence facility in West Germany to be established, and named it
the Geheln Organization. Gehlen promised not to hire any former SS, SD,
or Gestapo members; he hired them anyway, and the CIA did not stop him.
Two of Gehlen's early recruits were Emil Augsburg and Dr. Franz Six, who
had been part of mobile killing squads, which killed Jews,
intellectuals, and Soviet partisans wherever they found them. Other
early recruits included Willi Krichbaum, senior Gestapo leader for
southeastern Europe, and the Gestapo chiefs of Paris and Kiel, Germany.
With the encouragement of the CIA, Gehlen Org (Licio Gelli) set
up "rat lines" to get Nazi war criminals out of Europe so they wouldn't
be prosecuted. By setting up transit camps and issuing phony passports,
the Gehlen Org helped more than 5,000 Nazis leave Europe and relocate
around the world, especially in South and Central America.
There, mass
murderers like Klaus Barbie (the butcher of Lyons) helped governments
set up death squads in Chile, Argentina, El Salvador, and elsewhere.
KLAUS BARBIE
Known as the Nazi butcher of Lyons, France
during World War 2, Barbie was part of the SS which was responsible for
the and death of thousands of French people under the Germany
occupation.
HEINRICH RUPP
Some of Rupp's best work was done for the
CIA, after he was imported in Operation Paperclip. Rupp has been
convicted of bank fraud. He was an operative for the CIA and is deeply
involved in the Savings and Loan scandals. A federal jury has indicated
they believe testimony that Rupp, the late CIA Director William Casey -
then Reagan's campaign manager, and Donald Gregg, now U.S. Ambassador to
South Korea, flew with George Bush to Paris in 1980, during the election
in which Bush was on the ticket with Ronald Reagan.
The testimony states that three meetings
were held on October 19 and 20 at the Hotel Florida and Hotel Crillion.
The subject? According to the court testimony, the meetings were to
sabotage President Jimmy Carter's reelection campaign by delaying the
release of American hostages in Iran. The hostages were released on
January 20, 1981, right after Reagan and Bush were sworn into office.
Iran was promised return of its frozen
assets in the United States and the foundation for the Iran- Contra deal
was set into motion.
LICIO GELLI
Head of a 2400 member secret
Masonic Lodge,
P2, a neo-fascist organization, in Italy that catered to only the
elite, Gelli had high connections in the Vatican, even though he was not
a Catholic. P2's membership is totally secret and not even available to
its Mother Lodge in England. Gelli was responsible for providing
Argentina with the Exocet missile.
He was a double agent for the CIA and the
KGB. He assisted many former Nazi high officials in their escape from
Europe to Central America. He had close ties with the Italian Mafia.
Gelli was a close associate of Benito Mussolini. He was also closely
affiliated with Roberto Calvi, head of
the scandal-ridden Vatican Bank.
Calvi was murdered. Gelli's secret lodge
consisted of extremely important people, including armed forces
commanders, secret service chiefs, head of Italy's financial police, 30
generals, eight admirals, newspaper editors, television and top business
executives and key bankers - including Calvi. Licio Gelli and others in
P2 were behind the assassination of Pope John Paul 1.
The central figure in Europe and South America that linked the CIA,
Masonic Lodge, Vatican, ex-Nazis and several South American governments,
the Italian government and several international banks was Licio Gelli.
He, with Klaus Barbie and Heinrich Rupp, met with Ronald R. Rewald in
Uruguay to arrange for the Argentine purchase of the French-made Exocet
missile, used in the Falkland Island attack to kill British soldiers.
Who is Gelli and why was he so important?
To understand Gelli, one must understand the complex post war years of
Europe. The biggest threat to Europe in pre-war times was Communism - it
was the great fear of Communism that gave birth to the Fascists and the
Nazis. Though both sides were dreaded, the Fascists represented
right-wing government, while the Communist represent left-wing
government.
It was the right-wing that the United States
and the Catholic Church desired over Communism - because Communism would
destroy the capitalistic system. This is why the CIA and the Vatican had
go through with Operation Paperclip. The Nazis had massive amounts of
Soviet intelligence, had infiltrated Communist partisans, and were in no
way going to be given up to the Soviet Union.
Gelli worked both sides. He helped to found the Red Brigade, spied on
Communist partisans and worked for the Nazis at the same time, a double
agent. He helped establish the Rat Line, which assisted the flight of
high ranking Nazi officials from Europe to South America, with passports
supplied by
the Vatican and with the full
acknowledgment and blessing of the United States intelligence community.
While on one hand, the U.S. participated
in the war crime tribunals of key Nazi officials and maintained an
alliance with the Communist Soviet Union, secretly, the U.S. was
preparing for the cold war and needed the help of Nazis in the eventual
struggle the U.S. would have with the Soviet Union. Gelli's agreement
with U.S. intelligence to spy on the Communists after the war was
instrumental in saving his life. He was responsible for the murder and
torture of hundreds of Yugoslavian partisans.
The Vatican provided support to Nazis and Fascists because the
Communists were the real threat to the Church's survival. The Italian
Communists would have taxed the Church's vast holdings and the Church
has had a dismal experience with Communist governments throughout the
world - where religious freedom was stamped out.
Gelli was well connected with the Vatican from the days of the Rat Line
and he worked for American intelligence, as well. Gelli formed the P-2
Masonic Lodge-which did not follow the direction of any Grand Lodge - and
it was supplied with a sum of $10 million a month by the CIA. Its
membership was a Who's Who in the intelligence, military and Italian
community. So prominent was Gelli's influence, that he was even a guest
of honor at the 1981 inauguration of President Ronald Reagan.
Gelli used blackmail in order to gain prominent members of his P-2
lodge, its membership is estimated at 2400 members, including 300 of the
most powerful men in the Western World.. He was a close friend of Pope
Paul VI, Juan Peron of Argentina, Libyan Dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi,
and many high officials in the Italian and American governments - he is
also reported to have had some financial dealings with the George Bush
for President campaign.
Gelli and his P-2 lodge had staggering connections to banking,
intelligence and diplomatic passports. The CIA poured hundreds of
millions of dollars into Italy in the form of secret subsidies for
political parties, labor unions and communications businesses.
At the same time the Agency continued its
relationship with far-right and violent elements as a back-up should a
coup be needed to oust a possible Communist government. This covert
financing was exposed by the Prime Minister of Italy in a speech to
Parliament. He indicates that more than 600 people in Italy still remain
on the payroll of the CIA. Licio Gelli was an ardent Nazi and a perfect
asset of the CIA. As part of Reinhard Gehlen's intelligence team, he had
excellent contacts.
Licio was the go between for the CIA and the
Vatican through his P2 Lodge.
Project Paperclip was stopped in 1957, when West
Germany protested to the U.S. that these efforts had stripped it of
"scientific skills."
There was no comment about supporting Nazis.
Paperclip may have ended in 1957, but as you can be seen from Licio Gelli
and his international dealings with the CIA in Italy/P2, and Heinrich Rupp
with his involvement in October Surprise, the ramifications of Paperclip are
world-wide.
The Nazis became employed CIA agents, engaging in clandestine work with the
likes of George Bush, the CIA, Henry Kissinger, and the Masonic P2 lodge.
This is but one of the results of Operation Paperclip. Another umbrella
project that was spawned from Paperclip was MK-ULTRA.
A secret laboratory was established and funded by CIA director, Allen Dulles
in Montreal, Canada at McGill University in the Allen Memorial Institute
headed by psychiatrist Dr. Ewen Cameron. For the next several years Dr. Ewen
Cameron waged his private war in Canada. What is ironic about Dr. Cameron is
that he served as a member of the Nuremberg tribunal who heard the cases
against the Nazi doctors.
When it was at its height in drug experiments,
operation MK-ULTRA was formed. This was the brainchild of
Richard Helms who later came to be a CIA director. It was designed to
defeat the "enemy" in its brain-washing techniques. MK-ULTRA had another arm
involved in Chemical and Biological Warfare (CBW) known as
MK-DELTA.
The "doctors" who participated in these
experiments used some of the same techniques as the Nazi "doctors".
Techniques used by Dr. Cameron and previous Nazi
scientists include electro shock, sleep deprivation, memory implantation,
memory erasure, sensory modification, psychoactive drug experiments, and
many more cruel practices.
Project Paperclip brought us
MK-ULTRA. Paperclip ultimately brought in key
players involved in the Assassination of Pope 1, October Surprise (sabotage
of Carter's peace talks), and a great many other things still classified to
this day. The results of Project Paperclip were devastating, and very far
reaching. I guess that is what you would expect from collaborating with
Nazis.
This research shows that the OSS/CIA that was formed in the National
Security Act, the same agency that employed hundreds of Nazis, has been in
alliance with the Vatican through various Agency connections such as
Licio Gelli. The CIA/Vatican alliance that Assassinated Pope John Paul
1, JFK, and hundreds of dictators of 3rd world countries is the Illuminati.
The Bavarian Illuminati has been around for centuries in one way or another.
It's presence in the 20th century is the direct result of the Nazis. The
Nazi connections to the occult and the Bavarian
Thule Society were parallel
to the American members of 33rd degree Freemasonry. When the Operation
Paperclip was successfully executed, the Nazi element of the Bavarian Thule
society was fused with the American members of Freemasonry to create the
Illuminati.
Operation Paperclip, MK-ULTRA, October Surprise, and
George Bush are all
facets of
the Illuminati, a group whose ideals are rooted in the occult, and
dedicated to world domination.
Soon after the American Revolution, John Robinson, a professor of rural
philosophy at Edinburgh University in Scotland and member of a Freemason
lodge, said that he was asked to join the Illuminati. After studying the
group, he concluded that the purposes of the Illuminati were not compatible
with his beliefs.
In 1798, he published a book called "Proofs Of A Conspiracy," which states:
"An association has been formed for the
express purpose of rooting out all the religious establishments and
overturning all the existing governments.... The leaders would rule the
World with uncontrollable power, while all the rest would be employed as
tools of the ambition of their unknown superiors."
The CIA and the Vatican have rooted out all the
religious establishments in the world. The CIA has overthrown and set up
dictators under their control all over the world. The CIA and the Vatican
have fulfilled the purpose of the Illuminati.
The CIA and
the Vatican
"are"
the Illuminati.
[B]oth the USA and the Vatican... wished to
help the flight of war criminals from Europe, each with its own
objectives. Whereas the USA wanted to rescue them to carry out political
operations against Soviet Russia and the oncoming Cold War, the Vatican,
while thinking upon the same lines, had been motivated by an additional
objective. Namely to help former political and religious supporters whom
it had blessed during, the reign of terror under the Nazi imperium.
The basic motivation of such strange Vatican-USA fellowship... [was]
derived by the necessity... to recruit, as energetically and as quickly
as possible, trustworthy anti-Russian, anti-communist battalions ready
to fight against Bolshevik Russia. And where could Vatican and the State
Department find such ready, dedicated, anti-communist recruits, if not
in the rank and file of... the fleeing war criminals now seeking asylum
in the Americas and the USA? The fugitives... were now ready to... help
the USA fight Soviet Russia, her former ally.
The recruitment of proven anti-communist individuals, from the fleeing
war criminals, therefore became part and parcel of the USA-Vatican grand
postwar strategy.
While Vatican City and its many extraterritorial buildings in Rome
turned into the protective semi-official refuge for hundreds of war
criminals, the USA's State Department became busy integrating many of
them within its multi-varied branched subterranean machinery, operating
outside official officialdom.

The Great Patents Heist
from
GreyFalcon Website
One of the greatest rip-offs of all time was the
theft of German patents after World War II
It is quite acceptable to American pride to
acknowledge that immigrants have contributed to our prosperity and
greatness. It's a little harder to swallow that a good deal of our
scientific lead and prosperity - despite the ever-increasing burdens of
non-skilled illegal immigrants and unproductive home-growns - has come from
simply seizing German patents and inventions after World War I [the most
prominent war booty which Woodrow Wilson seized in 1917 was the patent on
aspirin, that "miracle drug"] and far more so after World War II.
There are those who claim the key to America's felicity has been its Jewish
citizens. After all, this is now a "service economy" of stockbrokers and
financial and entertainment services. Could America dispense with actually
manufacturing or growing anything, and instead focus on the essentials like
Broadway shows, Hollywood sitcoms and currency speculation?
The message of Bernt Engelmann's 1974 Deutschland ohne Juden, published in
English by Bantam Books, New York in 1984 as Germany Without Jews, is clear:
You Germans were mediocre until we Jews came, and now that we're gone, you
have sunk back into mediocrity.
Engelmann cites endless lists of great Jewish MDs of German or Austrian
domicile, several of whom, such as bacteriologists Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915)
and Robert Koch (1843-1910), won the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology
(Ehrlich, 1908; Koch, 1905). Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), of dubious
credentials, is one of Engelmann's prize examples.
Engelmann also slays entire forests with pages of printed paeans to
forgotten Jewish playwrights, songsters, operetta producers, critics,
publishers etc. How could one forget the immortal Meyerbeer? To the wary
eye, it smacks of ethnic self-congratulation. One gifted Jew writes a piece,
another publishes it, yet another reviews it favorably, a fourth sits at
the box office counting out his money and a fifth takes his 10 percent as
agent - an unconvincing proof that the nation of Mozart, Bach and Beethoven
needed music lessons.
Gottlieb Daimler (1834-1900) and Karl Benz (1844-1929) invented the modern
gasoline engine in 1878-1887. Other Germans took the lead in 19th-century
chemistry and created the first contact lens (in the 1880s), X-rays (Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895), quantum physics (discovered in 1900 by
Max Planck,
1858-1947), aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and last (and least), saccharin
in 1913.
As for previous centuries, the Germans got no credit for inventing
the croissant or "Kipferl," as the Germans call it, in Vienna to celebrate
defeating the Turks in 1683; one notes the Turkish religious logo, the
crescent (a baked good then snatched up by the French as the "croissant").
Equally, they receive zero credit for baking the first quiche, which in
Lorraine and Rhinelander dialects ("Kisch") simply means "kitchen leftovers
baked into a pie."
Baked goods aside, the facts reveal that the most creative period in world
history may have been Germany between 1932 and 1945, and that much of
America's scientific lead came from looting German patents by the ton, both
in World War I and far more so after World War II.
And because Germany was so devastated after World War II, there has been a
brain drain ever since of the top young German scientists - to Massachusetts
and California for computers and genetics and to greater Los Angeles,
Houston and Cape Canaveral for aerospace. As one German scientist remarked:
"Since the war, we have not had the financing capabilities for basic
research for the long-term future. That kind of serious money only the
Americans have. In Germany, and in Japan, also, we do applied and clinical
research for immediate applications. But to be on the cutting edge, the
money and the positions are now in America and we have to go there.
[1]
An astounding admission of the stripping of German inventiveness after the
war came in an October 1946 article by C. Lester Walker in Harper's
magazine.
Entitled "Secrets by the Thousands," it presents some problems for
the Bernt Engelmanns of this world who imply that German science in the
1932-45 period would have been "nothing without the Jews."
In fact, the article suggests in deadly seriousness that German Chancellor
Adolf Hitler had been right, from his point of view, to prolong the war to
the last gasp. According to the deputy commanding general of Army Air Forces
Intelligence, Air Technical Service Command, in a speech to the American
Society of Aeronautical Engineers:
The Germans were preparing rocket surprises
for the whole world in general and England in particular which would
have, it is believed, changed the course of the war if the invasion had
been postponed for so short a time as half a year.
Even without its brilliant Jewish minority, the
Germans',
"V-2 rocket which bombed London was just a toy compared to what the
Germans had up their sleeve."
They had 138 types of guided missiles in
various stages of production or development, using every kind of remote
control device or fuse: radio, radar, wire-guided, continuous wave,
acoustics, infrared, light beams and magnetism. And for power the Germans
were years ahead in jet propulsion at both subsonic and supersonic speeds -
even creating a "jet helicopter" wherein tiny jets spun the helicopter blade
tips at blinding speeds.
Just as the war was ending, and President Franklin Roosevelt was ordering
both Gens. George Patton and Dwight David Eisenhower to pull back and let
"Uncle Joe" (Josef Stalin) have Berlin and Eastern Europe, the Germans had
been readying their giant A-4 rocket for production.
Forty-six feet in
length, it weighed over 24,000 pounds and could travel 230 miles - rising 60
miles over the earth to a blistering top speed of 3,375 miles per hour. Its
secret was a rocket motor running on liquid nitrogen and alcohol. It was
either radar controlled or self-guided by a gyroscope. Since it flew faster
than the speed of sound (by many times), it could not be heard before it
struck.
Another rocket in the works was the A-9, still bigger at 29,000 pounds and
equipped with wings. It had a range of 3,000 miles. Manufactured at
Peenemünde, it arced into the sky at an incredible 5,870 miles per hour.
But most Americans know about German World War II rockets.
A few even know
that in addition to the car engine the Germans also invented the jet and
perfected the superhighway or Autobahn (the three most important inventions
binding this vast country. Virtually no one knows that in Wright-Patterson
Field in Ohio, in the Library of Congress and in the Department of Commerce
in Washington, a "mother lode" of 1,500 tons of German patents and research
papers were being mined furiously after the war.
One gloating Washington
bureaucrat called it,
"the greatest single source of this type of material in
the world, the first orderly exploitation of an entire country's brain
power."
Fortunately, it was for the benefit of the United States, which, having
thwarted Hitler's crusade against the Soviet Union, had to take up the same
gauntlet against a communism spread worldwide by the late 1940s.
The genesis of the project to grab German secrets was in 1944, when, amazed
by German technology in everything from rockets and jets to Tiger tanks, a
Joint Intelligence Objectives committee was set up to confiscate German
inventions the instant they were obtained, even before the surrender, for
use against Japan.
Even before reaching the German border, fascinating discoveries began to be
made, including one with which every American is familiar: audio tape.
The 1946 Harper's article shows the head of the
Technical Industrial Intelligence Branch, in quaint excitement:
"...[p]ulling some brown, papery-looking
ribbon off a spool. It was a quarter-inch wide, with a dull side and a
shiny side. "That's Magnetophone tape," he said. [2] "It's plastic,
metalized on one side with ferrous oxide. In Germany, that supplanted
phonograph recordings. A day's radio program can be magnetized on one
reel. [Then] you can demagnetize it, wipe it off, and put on a new
program at any time. No needle, no noise or record wear. An hour-long
reel costs 50 cents."
A Short History of Recording and Its Effects
Upon Music by Michael Chanan [3] points out that even in the late 1920s,
before the "12 darkest years of German history,"
[4] one Fritz Pfleumer had
developed a plastic recording tape. It was launched commercially by BASF
[5]
in 1934. The idea was based on the film strip, and its original application
was for dictation in an office environment. In Britain, a project funded by
the great radio genius Guglielmo Marconi was attempting the same thing. (On
D-Day, the Americans played audio tapes of combat loudly at various
locations to try to throw off the German defenders.)
However, the great leap forward came when one A. M. Poniatoff, president of
a small California company called Ampex (a trade name still familiar to the
older generation), then wearing a U.S. Army uniform, helped seize
German-held Radio Luxembourg in late 1944. Instantly grasping the gold mine
in profits and quality which the Magnetophone tape represented, Poniatoff
had the 3M Company rush the new tape into American production, and it swept
the Los Angeles entertainment industry.
Its major breakthrough came in 1947 when Bing Crosby first used it to record
his network shows. The crooner not only preferred the Magnetophone sound but
invested heavily in Ampex. Later, movie soundtracks went onto audio tape as
well, improving mixing and dubbing efficiency as well, and avoiding the
infuriating mishap where a successfully shot movie scene had to be retaken
due to sound defects. Ampex later went on to introduce the first videotape
recorders in 1956 (all now but a memory, sacrificed on the altar of free
trade with Japan).
The list goes on and on: synthetic mica, which increased American cold steel
production by 1,000 percent; "the secrets for 50,000 dyes, many of [which]
are faster and better than ours, colors we were never able to make"; milk,
butter and bread preservation without chemicals; and refrigeration and
air-conditioning for German U-boats so efficient that their subs could
cruise from the Atlantic to the Pacific, fight there for two months and
return to Germany without having to take on fresh water for the crew. In
addition, there was the pilot ejector seat, the infrared rifle scope, and
even the negative-air ionizer, which many Americans use for the fresh
feeling it puts in the air, with claims of reduced blood pressure, allergy
and asthma symptoms.
In addition to official government looting of Germany (what GIs always
called "liberating"), there was also the personal looting bonanza
exemplified by Robert Maxwell, financier extraordinaire, and at one time the
most hated man in Britain. The great contribution of this Orthodox Jewish
citizen, born Jan Hoch in what was then Czechoslovakia, was to found a
scientific publishing empire in Britain, called Pergamon Press, based
entirely on German research he had looted with British intelligence
connivance.
Maxwell came to dominate the British tabloid
press and raided his own employees' pension fund to the tune of 90 million
pounds. He finally perished mysteriously and nakedly in a plunge from his
yacht in 1991 just a week after standing up to the Israeli secret police,
the Mossad - who may have set him up in business in the first place.
Interestingly, his main co-conspirator in the United States, Robert Rubin,
formerly of Goldman Sachs, is now secretary of the treasury
[6].
When not gunning down a surrendering German mayor armed only with a white
flag (as he boasted in a Der Spiegel interview) or bribing British officers
to invent his heroic war record (for which war record Montgomery personally
pinned a medal on him), Maxwell/Hoch [7] was in the British Zone of Berlin
in 1946 with the full backing of British intelligence, coercing the vast
research findings of the Springer science publishing house from Springer's
widow for pence on the pound.
Ultimately, after Maxwell stripped $94 million from the pension funds of the
5,000 employees of the Mirror Group, his U.S. financiers at Goldman Sachs
were stripped of an estimated $250 million to settle their claims -
whereupon Maxwell's body was fished from the sea by an astonished Spaniard,
to be buried with full honors in Israel and hopefully forgotten. Far from
exemplifying that the Germans were nothing without Jewish scientific help,
his life suggested that one Jew could become a billionaire exploiting German
ideas.
Which raises the justifiable question of the atom bomb, which European Jews
did produce for America and German scientists did not provide in time for
Germany.
In his magisterial Verschwörung und Verrat um Hitler ("Conspiracy and
Treason Against Hitler"), [8] Gen.
Otto Ernst Remer details how anti-Hitler
elements in the German scientific community maneuvered their own Werner Carl
Heisenberg (b. 1901) into the key uranium-developing program at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute (now succeeded by the Max Planck Institute of Physics).
His clear mission, proudly proclaimed after World War II,
[9] was to
bureaucratically delay the German A-bomb project until the Allies had won
the war. [10]
As just one example, munitions minister Albert Speer pleaded with Heisenberg
and his fellow conspirator von Weizsäcker (brother of a later West German
president) to name whatever money or materials they required after they
claimed they had been held up by shortages. Von Weizsäcker's reply asking
for "40,000 marks" caused Speer to stare in amazement, and to later confess
that he had himself planned to propose 100 million marks for starters.
Not only did Heisenberg state explicitly to Der Spiegel,
"We never tried to produce any atomic bombs
and we are glad not to be responsible for having made any," he also
admitted leaking the latest information on German uranium-splitting
research to the half-Jewish Danish scientist Niels Bohr, who promptly
informed his racial confreres in the U.S.
Thus, Germany did not lack the bomb because it
lacked Jews, but rather because a handful of key scientists hostile to
Hitler wormed their way into the German atomic program. Heisenberg had even
admitted to a shocked Luftwaffe audience in 1942, after the devastating
British 1,000-bomber annihilations of the port cities of Kiel and Lübeck,
that Germany could produce a bomb with material "the size of a banana"
(gesturing with his hands) to wipe out an entire enemy city, but then he
caught himself and said this of course would be economically impossible.
[11]
One of Gen. Remer's most interesting assertions is that just as the
Americans were racing in the final days to convert German inventions for use
against Japan, Hitler was sending a U-Boat packed with secrets to that same
nation at Emperor Hirohito's explicit request.
In Verschwörung und Verrat um Hitler, Remer first notes the criticism that
propaganda minister Josef Göbbels had received for his "stand-fast, the
miracle weapons are coming" message after Stalingrad.
Ironically, while many of these weapons came too
late to save Germany from its fate of occupation, government decapitation
and dismemberment, Remer reports that a member of U-234 sent him the
following:
In the spring of 1945 I was ordered to report to serve on U-234.
The sub was a specially redesigned former mine layer of the type XB with
1,760 tons, 4,200 horsepower and a 52-man crew.
The commander was [a] Capt. Fehler.
On March 23, 1945 the boat steamed out of Kiel toward southern Norway
unsubmerged. On April 15, 1945 it dove at South Christians and with an
immediate goal of proceeding between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The
destination was Japan.
Our orders stated that we were to bring air force Gen. Kessler as a
Luftwaffe attaché with his staff and technicians to Tokyo. The [emperor] had
asked us to help build up Japan's air defenses with the weapons developed in
Germany.
Also on board to this end were, besides the general, two air force officers,
a navy anti-aircraft specialist, an underwater demolitions specialist, a
low-frequency specialist from the staff of Prof. Küpfmüller as well as two
Messerschmitt engineers (specialists for the construction of Me-262s)
[12]
and two Japanese frigate captains. One of them was [a] Capt. Tomonaga, who
had collaborated with us in his capacity as a specialist for one-man
torpedoes [13] when we were developing our own small combat boats.
Our cargo consisted of 12 steel cylinders, of the sort used for storing in
mines, containing comprehensive microfilm material on the latest
developments in German offensive and defensive weaponry, especially in
rocket and rocket defense [anti-rocket rockets; TBR ed.] warfare, as well as
our research findings in the areas of high- and low-frequency technology,
and finally a decisive contribution to the development of nuclear energy and
atomic warfare.
After passing through the Straits of Iceland and 28 days submerged at an
average depth of 260 feet, a message reached us in the night of the 12th to
the 13th of May [14] during snorkel travel, in which Grand Admiral [Karl]
Dönitz ordered us to capitulate. At this point in time we were located in
the middle of the Atlantic, southeast of the banks of Newfoundland.
The order to our captain was couched in a very personal tone, telling him to
hand the U-boat over without destroying its valuable cargo. [15]
After 12
hours of debate and reflection, Capt. Fehler decided in harmony with Gen.
Kessler and after informing the two Japanese frigate captains that he would
be carrying out Dönitz's order and surface to surrender. The two Japanese
officers took their own lives before the boat surfaced.
Eight hours later, U-234 was taken as a prize of war by the American
destroyer Sutton and brought to the U.S. Navy base at Portland, Maine.
The American officers and officials who subsequently interrogated us were
evidently horrified over the contents of our U-boat. They criticized us for
supposedly having no idea how valuable our cargo was. At the end of July
1945 the officer in charge of the investigation team declared to me that the
microfilm evidence and the testimony of our technicians had proved that in
decisive technical developments, we were "100 years" ahead of the United
States.
Which raises the nagging question of where all these continual "UFO"
sightings come from, which began a few short years after World War II - and
the capture of German high tech. The same government which gave us the
Warren Commission cover-up, the public silent treatment of the Israeli
assault on the USS Liberty, [16] and a blithe nonchalance about the social
significance of the Black/White/Asian racial differences proven in the
best-selling Harvard study The Bell Curve, seems anxious to keep the public
in the dark about all such "unconfirmed" sightings.
[17]
It is at least interesting that it was just two years after the seizure of
"50 tons" [18] of German aerospace and physics papers that the first major
UFO story,
the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico incident, broke.
After all, what has
fascinated researchers ever since (particularly government skeptics
monitoring
Area 51 at Groom Lake, north of Las Vegas) is things the Germans
were working on: spacecraft which use new, tough, but lightweight materials,
make 180 degree turns at Mach 4 without spilling the drinks and generally
defy the laws of gravity, perhaps by the use of gyroscopes within
gyroscopes.
It is well known that the German SS sent expeditions to Tibet, reputedly a
land of mind-over-matter marvels - in the late 1930s.
[19] The purpose was
both to delve into evidence of Indo-European origins in the Himalayas and
secret techniques used there, possibly including anti-gravity levitation.
What ties this together with Europe, ancient America and Egypt is the
finding of blond mummies or Nordic remains in or near many sites of
architectural miracles.
As anyone who has seen the excellent programs on Egypt on the cable History
Channel, can testify, both the people living in ancient Egypt and the rulers
of Macchu Picchu were doing virtually gravity-defying feats in constructing
their pyramids and temples.
One can only speculate as to what secrets the Germans may have revived or
discovered anew during the Third Reich, and which are now being utilized by
the current government in Washington. It is well known from excavations of
blond mummies in Egypt and in South America by Thor Heyerdahl as well as the
statements of Mexican Emperor Montezuma (welcoming the Spanish "back" as
their fabled "white gods") that some sort of ancient white scientists or
advanced physicists were involved with the origins of these cultures.
Even the Chinese admit the existence of
red-haired, blue-eyed tribes constantly infiltrating into ancient China (of
which pictorial evidence is presented in a recent National Geographic). The
great teacher Confucius himself (roughly 551-479 B.C.), of the noble K'ung
family, was said to be a man of unusually tall stature for a Chinese, and
Genghis Khan (A.D. 1167-1227), the Mongol conqueror, had red hair and green
eyes.
But the historical blackout continues. The government appears to be willing
to hint that "aliens" from outer space are behind all this high tech.
God
forbid it should turn out that ancient Indo-Europeans were doing these
things thousands of years ago, or especially Germans researching without the
benefit of the Jews in the Third Reich.
Notes
[1] In Anton Zischka's Und war es ein Wunder
("And It Was a Miracle") we read:
"If the surely not oversensitive Nazis
had retired [with pension!] a total of 1,628 professors when they took
power, the victims of the [Allied] anti-Nazis numbered no less than
4,289 professors and instructors, who received no pension whatsoever. As
the newspaper Christ und Welt calculated in 1950, the Nazis dismissed
9.8 percent of their university teaching staff, the Allies 32.1 percent.
Almost every third German professor lost his teaching or research post
through the will of the victors. In Germany as a whole it was every
second professor... In accordance with Control Commission Directive No.
24 of January 1, 1946, a total of 373,762 persons were found
inappropriate for any public service or economic activity above that of

"Captured" German and Japanese Information and
Know-How
Following the advancing Allied Troops into France, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Germany, and, later, Japan, teams of military and industrial specialists
came right on the heels of the combat units to collect documents and study
German and Japanese military and industrial developments that had produced
some of the major weapons used by the enemies especially towards the end of
the war: the jet engine, the V-1 and V-2 rockets, high-speed aircraft,
remotely guided mini-tanks to destroy combat tanks, one- and two-man
kamikaze U-boats, and many more.
Worse, there was talk of the existence of
flying saucers, atomic bombs, chemical and biological ammunition, and other
miracle weapons which Hitler or the Japanese were going to use during the
end-phase of the fighting in order to wrest victory from the Allied Forces.
The more desperate the situation became for the Axis Powers, the weirder the
schemes that came to light: there was talk, for example, that the Japanese
were building mini-bombers which could be stored on U-boats and thus
transported close to the Central American mainland.
Re-assembled on board
and launched from the boat, these bombers were to destroy in a suicide
mission, the gates of the Panama Canal and thus interrupt the shipping of
essential war materials and supplies from the factories of the eastern
United States to the Pacific theater of war. The American and British teams
of military and industrial specialists following the combat troops were
charged to find out what was actually there and what could, reasonably, be
expected to happen. This was, by no means, a safe and pleasant job.
Most of
the 'targets' had, more or less, been subjected to bombing or devastated
during the fighting; the Germans were still counter-attacking; there were
mines and unexploded ammunition everywhere; and the just 'liberated '
Germans were not always friendly or co-operating. Some of the intelligence
men lost their lives or were wounded and all were living and working under
conditions that were not better than those for the soldiers.
But why the
hurry, could this information gathering not have taken place later?
One reason why not was the lack of intelligence concerning the state of
atomic bomb development in Germany. The Allies did not know that Hitler, not
wanting, or not being able to recognize the revolutionary potential of
atomic weapons, did not favor, and, therefore, support financially, the
development of these bombs on the level that would have assured success.
There was also talk later on that German physicists like
Werner Heisenberg
and Otto Hahn, and their staffs, who had been in the forefront of atomic
research prior to the war, were hesitant to deliver the all-destructive
power of the atom into the Führer's hands and kept stalling. Furthermore,
some of the most brilliant minds had left Germany and Europe for the United
States during Hitler's persecution of the Jews and were now working for the
Allies.
True or false: the West did not know what was really going on and
how far the German research had advanced literally until the last days of
the conflict when, with the capture of Heisenberg, they finally could
breathe easier.
What was known to the Allies was that the German chemists had developed
highly toxic and deadly gases and biological cultures, that these were
already being used to kill Jews and other 'undesirables' by the thousands,
and that there would be a good chance that Hitler would use these poisons at
the end of the war to destroy his enemies and what was left of his own
people. To secure and study these weapons and, possibly, find antidotes, was
another reason for the rapid deployment of the intelligence troops.
Thirdly, it was expected that the war against Japan, especially following
the Allied invasion of the Japanese homeland, would be a bitterly fought and
long-lasting battle costing many casualties on both sides. Where there any
weapons in the German arsenal that could be quickly adapted for use against
the Japanese?
Finally, the development of German miracle weapons had to be based on
advances in research and development by Germany's industry and research
facilities from basic to advanced levels and the results of that research
had to be made available to American and Allied companies for their
exploitation and use, especially during the period of conversion from
wartime to peacetime economy.
The Collectors
The teams collecting military and industrial information and documents were
made up of small groups of military and/or industrial specialists, working
independently. They were recruited from military or Government laboratories
and from American and British companies and were experts in their fields.
Knowing the state of development in their specialties in their own
countries, they were able to judge whether German development was superior,
inferior, or just useful.
All teams reported to their own field agencies;
their reports were generally classified "secret" until after the
capitulation of Germany and of Japan respectively.
There seems to have been
little coordination or cooperation between the individual agencies and, to
the dismay of German factory owners and what was left of their technical
staffs, many of the targets were visited by several teams and more than
once, and, what one team left behind, the others took.
The most important agencies working in Germany
and their 'fields of interest' were the following:
(1)
-
OSS, the Office of Strategic Services -
identified targets of strategic and industrial importance and provided
this information to other agencies which then sent investigative teams.
-
EEIS, the Enemy Equipment Intelligence
Service - actually located German and Japanese equipment, such as new
aircraft, tanks, binoculars, ammunition, metalworking equipment, etc.
for evaluation and to instruct Allied personnel in its use. Later, the
staff was used to evaluate German industrial equipment in general.
-
ALSOS Mission - This group, composed of
military and counter-intelligence specialists was charged with a
specific mission: to determine the state of atomic bomb development in
Germany.
-
FIAT, the Field Intelligence Agency,
Technical - was established to investigate German industrial development
during 1939 - 1945 primarily in the American Occupation Zone.
Headquartered in Frankfurt, it was the 'collecting' arm of the Technical
Industrial Intelligence Committee (TIIC).
-
CIOS, the Combined Intelligence Objectives
Subcommittee - was made up of American and British specialists to
examine German industrial targets. The reports issued by this group are
the CIOS and JIOA (Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency) document
series.
-
TIIB, the Technical Industrial Intelligence
Branch (later: TIIC, Technical Industrial Intelligence Committee) - was
established as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff but transferred to
the Department of Commerce in January 1946. Its task was to look into
every segment of the German industrial landscape and obtain any
information that might be of interest to American companies.
During 1946 TIIB sent over 400 investigators
into Germany. Many of these industrial experts traveled at their
company's expense, sworn in as temporary Government employees without
compensation. TIIB arranged with the Army for their transportation and
for their living and working quarters in Germany.
In return, the investigators agreed that
their findings would be fully reported in writing to TIIB and that these
reports would be made public.
To make sure that individual investigators did
not use information obtained from German companies for their own or their
company's exclusive use, two men from competing companies were teamed up.
Furthermore, the reports submitted were reviewed for completeness by TIIB
staff and the American military government.
Overall, TIIB staff selected
from the 3.5 billion pages collected from the files of German industry about
3.5 million which were considered of interest to United States industry. The
documents chosen were filmed in Germany, the rest were left there. In
addition, TIIB brought more than 300,000 pounds of German equipment and
product samples from Germany, in addition to the 200 tons of materials
captured by the Army and Navy, which was also turned over to civilian
agencies for study and testing after the military had completed its studies
(2).
Navy Technical Mission, Europe (Japan) - original a portion of the ALSOS
Mission, was assigned to investigate German (and Japanese) advances in
synthetic fuels and lubricants of interest to the Navy. U.S. Naval Technical
Oil Mission in Europe: Production of Synthetic Fuels by the Hydrogenation of
Solid and Liquid Carbonaceous Materials (PB 27701).
-
TOM (Technical Oil Mission) - A non-military group sponsored by the U.S.
Bureau of Mines, was made up of American and British petroleum experts and
charged with investigating the industrial production of synthetic fuels and
lubricants from coal using the Fischer-Tropsch method. The Bureau and
American industry actually built petroleum manufacturing plants according to
German specifications after the war, but the glut of petroleum available
then made the program uneconomical.
In the 1970's, however, faced with a
petroleum embargo, the Republic of South Africa developed the SASOL
synthetic petroleum plant using the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Working under
different economic constellations, it is still in operation today. U.S.

number: Z6972.U6)
The Documents Research Center, A-2, United States Air Forces in Europe - was,
"organized for the purpose of collecting and processing all captured German
air documents. The organization was moved to Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, in
1946 where the project is being continued by the Air Documents Division,
Intelligence, T-2. While the Research Center was still in Europe it was
estimated that between 1,000 and 1,500 tons of German air documents
eventually would be collected.
The final screened library, however, and the
collection which is now at Wright Field consists of approximately 220 tons.
These documents are in the process of being cataloged, indexed, abstracted,
translated and analyzed." (3)
-
The Library of Congress was to have received a complete copy of the filmed
material but only about one third of the total output was sent. The archival
copy was turned over by the Air Force to the Smithsonian Air and Space
Museum and can be consulted at its Garber Facility in Suitland, MD. The copy
retained by the Library of Congress cannot be used in modern reader-printers
which tear the microfilm copies into small segments.
All books and journals
from the same haul were turned over by the Air Force to the Library of
Congress where they were examined and new items incorporated into the
general collections. Duplicates were made available to other libraries or
discarded, if not claimed. The reports are indexed in a multi-volume Desk
Catalog of German and Japanese Air-Technical Documents (Z5063.A1U6). Some of
the air documents were also made available to the Publication Board of the
Department of Commerce, re-issued and made available to the public as PB
documents.
-
The United States Strategic Bombing Survey - studied the effectiveness of
the Allied bombing effort on targets in Germany, as well as German-occupied
France, Belgium and the Netherlands.
-
The Library of Congress Foreign Mission - was sent to gather books and
journals published in Germany (and the rest of Europe) and not available for
purchase through normal channels once the war had been declared.
Up to that
point German literature could still be obtained either directly from the
sources or by way of neutral countries (Sweden).
The Targets
Any company having in some form contributed to the German war effort (and
who had not, no matter how large and small) or having research information
or products that would be of interest to Allied manufacturers, was
considered a 'target'. Much information on German industries had already
been compiled and made available to the Allied air armies by the United
States intelligence agencies.
Further targets were research institutes,
universities, military laboratories, testing ranges and supply depots,
Government agencies like the Reichsforschungsrat (The National Research
Council), even concentration camps (sites of medical research using humans
as test objects), the Reichspatentamt (Patent Office), the
Reichsluftfahrtministerium (Air Force Ministry), the Wehrmachtwaffenamt
(Army Weapons Agency), their subordinate departments, research/test
facilities, etc...
It was not always easy to find the targets - many had been destroyed by
bombing or during combat, their documents burned, looted, removed for or
from safe storage; owners, managers, scientific personnel killed, drafted
into the armed forces, dispersed, relocated; roads and rail lines
impassible; the population frightened, uncooperative, hostile:
'After what you have done to us, why should
we give you our family- company- and commercial secrets? They belong to
us, we will need them to rebuild...'
In other cases people cooperated willingly,
often for the chance of getting food, cigarettes.
Sometimes several visits and some arm-twisting was needed to get the Germans
to deliver documents, information, and sometimes it just took a good dose of
Yankee ingenuity. Theodore von Karman, a world famous aeronautical
scientist, who was a member of one of the teams looking for information on
German experimental aircraft, describes his experiences at an aeronautical
research facility near Braunschweig that had escaped Allied detection and
bombing because it was so well camouflaged that nobody knew it existed.
The team had gone through the trashed, chaotic
laboratories, looking, but finding very little, when, suddenly, on a desk in
a corner someone noticed a scale model of the swept-wing bomber, a type of
aircraft that nobody had ever seen before. They reasoned that were there was
a model, there must also be documentation, like wind tunnel, testing, and
design data. But no matter where they looked and whom they interrogated, the
records could not be located.
Finally von Karman, who had been a student at
nearby Göttingen University before the war, resorted to a ruse:
I had with me a sergeant assigned to
Intelligence. Frank Tchitcherine was of Russian origin, and in fact had
been related to the first minister of education in the Kerensky
government of Russia.
As we were walking to our automobile with the
director, I said in English, which I knew the director understood:
'Listen, Tchitcherine, we are through here.
I think now it is time to notify Russian Intelligence to take over'
Russian Intelligence was nowhere in the
vicinity. But I knew that the Germans were terrified of the Russians and
that this might stir them into action. I was right. The next day the
director called in Tchitcherine and took him to a dry well. He looked
inside. It was full of documents.
Among them were the papers describing the sweptback wing and providing
considerable wind-tunnel data which showed clearly that the sweptback plane
had superior speed properties near the speed of sound. These data were the
first of its kind. Schairer quickly wrote to his Boeing associates to stop
work on the Mach 1 transonic plane with the straight wing which they had
designed, telling them of his find. He microfilmed the data and used them
when he got back to Seattle to design the B-47, the first U.S. sweptback
bomber....
In going through the papers, Ted Toller, one of my former assistants who was
on a committee involved with these documents, came to me one day and said
that he had found a very interesting report. The title, as translated by the
English-speaking German sergeant, was 'The Resistance of Undernourished
Bodies.' Troller wondered what this title was doing in a collection of
aerodynamics material. So he looked up the author and found it was von
Karman.
It was a translation of my 1931 paper 'The Drag on Slender Bodies'.
"The documents revealed that the Germans had conducted a variety of
interesting research at Braunschweig. For instance, they had run studies of
the effect of wind on human beings and shown that the human being can take
velocities up to 550 miles an hour. They also had developed an emergency
pressure suit fixed up with a cylinder of oxygen like those used in USAF
life rafts. If a plane flying at 70,000 feet loses pressure, the pilot can
jerk a ribbon and re-pressurize himself. All these items were valuable to
the United States." (4)
The Loot
I am not sure that there was, in the end, an exact accounting of how many
documents/pages were taken from Germany, or if that was at all possible.
Some documents contained more than 1,000 pages, others, like patent
applications, only one.
Von Karman, in the source already cited goes on to say that,
"some 3,000,000
documents, weighing 1,500 tons were sifted and microfilmed in Europe;
eventually they formed the basis for the collections of ASTIA, the Armed
Services Technical Information Agency," ...now the Defense Technical
Information Center (DTIC).
The Annual Report of the Secretary of Commerce
for 1946 (5) talks about 3,500,000 pages that TIIB selected. If one adds the
documents brought to the United States and processed at Wright Field, and
those deposited at the Library of Congress, then the number of pages becomes
astronomical.
I remember that when I came to the Library in 1957, there were large green
boxes, 'footlockers' 8 feet long, stored, to the very ceilings, in the
hallways and vestibules of the 4th floor of the Adams Building, containing
documents to be processes by the Air Information and Air Technology
Divisions under contract to the Air Force. One day they were gone - "shipped
back to Germany" and soon AID and ATD were abolished also.
In addition to
corporate papers, there were interviews with plant/laboratory personnel,
photographs, blueprints, patents and patent applications (the Secretary of
Commerce talks of thousands of applications obtained from the files of the
giant
I.G.Farben complex alone which had not even been filed with the
Reichspatentamt because of staff shortages everywhere) and much more. From
these mountains of materials the industrial teams prepared summary reports
some up to 1,000 pages thick.
To give an idea of the coverage it is
interesting to look at just a small selection of the important new
discoveries which they contained:
One of the best customers for German technical information were the American
aircraft and airline industries.
In addition to general studies of the
German air transport industry (PB 17920, 19717), there are studies on:
-
'Plastics in the Aircraft Industry' (PB 1104, 4351, 27000, 58373)
-
'Aircraft
Hydraulic and Fuel Systems' (PB 16684)
-
'Magnetic Brakes for Propellers (PB
464, 4349)
-
'Helicopters' (PB 6339, 6340, 16712, 17544)
-
'De-icing of
Windshields' (PB462, 23815, 23856, 31251, 40292, 58242)
Then there are numerous reports:
-
Reports on rocket fuels (PB186, 392, 405, 4284, 23815, etc). In
terms of military aircraft two reports are of interest: The Horton Tail-less
Aircraft (PB 260) possibly a forerunner of the stealth bomber, and German
High-Speed Airplanes and Design Development (CIOS XXXI-3).
-
In the area of construction the Germans were forced, because of the
devastating success of Allied bombings, to put their most important
factories underground. Immense tunnels running for miles under the Harz
Mountains in Thuringia were built by slave labor from the nearby Buchenwald
concentration camp at a horrendous cost in human lives to house whole
synthetic fuel refineries as well as aircraft and rocket assembly lines.
-
Obviously, such underground installations and their ventilation, heating and
cooling, sanitation, etc. systems were of great interest to the Bureau of
Mines and the mining industries, as well as the Defense Department, which
was preparing abandoned mines as 'safe places' for high Government officials
in case of future wars. (PB 25638, 25639, 27779).
-
Acetylene is one of the most versatile intermediates for the generation of
synthetic rubbers, plastics (vinyl), and industrial alcohols, plus many
other compounds. It is also highly explosive so that its generation,
transport and use must be subject to very strict controls. German industry,
depending greatly on acetylene, devoted much energy and research to making
it safe and expanding its use. (PB 188, 189, 377, 485, 517, 969, 1017, 4287,
7745, 7747, 23750, 25560, 28556, 44943, 46966).
-
Germany has not been blessed with significant oil deposits; to fuel her war
machine she depended on imports from the Soviet Union and Rumania. When
these sources were lost, she had to rely on synthetic fuel derived from her
rich coal reserves. The process, called the Fischer-Tropsch Process, uses
water gas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide derived from the
hydrogenation of coal, coke, or lignite and extra hydrogen over catalysts at
elevated pressures and temperature to generate straight-chain hydrocarbons
and waxes which can be further processed to yield fuels, lubricants, facts,
even some type of margarine. (PB 284, 288, 289, 373, 1279, 1291, 7745, 7917,
12624, 18911, 18926, 23750, 28883, 46390, 49196, 66130, 75817, 75845, 77706,
78242)
-
Plastics and synthetic fibers have always spawned successful industries in
Germany. Here are just a few examples of many reports published in these
areas: 'Plastic Plants' (PB 400, 403, 531, 979, 1069, 25642, 37784);
'Chemical Developments in the Synthetics Industry' (PB 1243); 'Soda Ash and
Caustic Soda' (PB 7746, 7797, 27434, 40122); 'Dyestuff Intermediates' (PB
82, 60945, 67569, 77672, 78269, 78276)
-
Solid fuels: Germany always has had enormous supplies of coal in the Ruhr
and, after the annexation of portions of Poland in 1939, also control over
the Upper Silesia coal deposits. Improving the technologies of mining and
processing coal was important for the war effort (PB 1827, 4322, 4323, 4345,
4461, 4462, 20579).
-
Sulfonamide: In wars past more soldiers died of infections of their wounds
than in actual combat. With the beginning of the 20th century, great strides
were made in the development of sanitary methods and anti-bacterial agents.
German doctors, chemists and pharmacists had always been in the forefront of
medical research. The development of sulfonamide was no exception (that it
was tested on human guinea pigs in the concentration camps is another
chapter). (PB 237, 248, 918, 77766, 80380 with 10 supplements)
-
One of the most dreaded diseases was malaria and research to find effective
drugs was really universal. The German effort , except for the test methods,
was significant (PB 237, 239, 246, 1101, 1718, 1859, 81613)
-
Some of the most cruel experiments were performed in the field of aviation
medicine by the infamous SS-doctor Sigismund Rascher at Dachau Concentration
Camp. Simulating conditions experienced by a pilot shot down over the North
Atlantic, he subjected inmates to exposure to cold by immersing them in ice
water to find out how long they could survive and possibly have a chance for
being rescued (PB250). Another experiment involved pilots at high,
oxygen-poor altitudes - when should they pull the cord to inflate the
parachute and how long could they free-fall before losing consciousness?
(same report).
-
Metallurgists in Germany were far ahead of their American counter-parts in
the field of magnesium and magnesium alloy production and processing; the
reports were much in demand by American companies (PB 204, 18930, 18948,
29663, 23748, 44675, 49828, 94315)
One curiosity is reported in the literature that simply begs to be repeated:
Among all these high-technology, war-related products and efforts, there
appears a lonely teddy bear and other stuffed toy animals manufactured by
the Steiff Company, which was the target investigated by a British
specialist on behalf of a British manufacturer.
Evaluating the Loot
The activities of FIAT and the 'acquisition' of German industrial know-how
are best described in a unique book by John Gimbel: "Science, Technology,
and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany." It is
'must-reading' for anybody studying or interested in the years immediately
following World War II in Europe. It is the only attempt, to my knowledge,
of reporting the efforts of trying to put a price tag on what was taken.
In
summary, Gimbel refers to a meeting early in 1947 in Moscow of the Council
of Foreign Ministers, established by the victorious nations to deal with
problems arising from inter-zonal relations and the question of German
reparations.
Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister,
"argued the case of his government's
claim against Germany for 10 billion dollars in reparations, reportedly
stating that Great Britain and the United States had already received
considerable reparations from Germany in the form of patents and other
technical know-how. 'Press reports say that these reparations amount to more
than ten billion dollars' Molotov said" (6)
(In true Soviet fashion, and
true to the old Communist maxim that 'what is yours is mine and what is mine
is none of your business' Molotov did not mention that the Soviet Union had
already taken from her occupation zone literally everything that was not
nailed down, and if it had been, they took that and the nails, too. For
example, the Russians dismantled vast stretches of the rail system in East
Germany, the locomotives, passenger- and freight cars, the rails, the ties
upon which the rails rested, and then the gravel upon which the ties had
been laid).
"General Marshall", Gimbel continues, "the American Foreign
Minister, in response stated: 'We have used United States scientists to
obtain information on German science, including patents, all of which
information is being published in pamphlets and made available to the rest
of the world.
As a matter of fact, Amtorg, the Soviet Purchasing Agency in
the United States, has been so far the biggest single purchaser of these
pamphlets. The pamphlets cost a nominal fee to cover printing and
administrative expenses. No ten billion in reparations is involved."
(7)
But once raised, the question of the value of the German industrial
information obtained by Britain and the United States would not go away.
Early estimates ranged from $10 million to $275 million. It was General
Lucius Clay, the American High Commissioner in Germany, who kept on raising
the question and prod the War-, Navy-, State-, and Commerce Departments to
come up with a 'realistic' figure.
General Clay was not against the official
position of the United States that America should not pay the Germans for
the industrial know-how taken; on the other hand he felt strongly that the
value of this information should be counted towards the reparations that
would be imposed by the victors on the Germans. Years of political
maneuvering between the U.S. Government departments involved produced no
results.
The Departments of the Army and the Navy did submit data; Commerce declined,
saying that the true value could only be assessed five to ten years down the
road when it became known what American industry had done with the
information; State refused to comply outright saying,
"that such an evaluation would serve no
practical purpose except 'to keep the American conscience clean'... The
FIAT material should not be valued for reparation purposes.
The
discussants had essentially three reasons:
-
First, given the hundreds of
tons of documents and materials held by the Commerce Department, the
task of sorting and evaluating separate items with the staff that could
be assigned to it would be physically impossible.
-
Second, the material
was not only for the United States, and it would be doubtful that other
countries would agree to charge their reparations accounts similarly.
-
Third, reparations was an integral concern and properly the subject of
an international agreement." (8)
John Gimbel tried to make his own evaluation of
the know-how taken from Germany. Using statements made in public or in
writing by U.S. Government officials and industrialists directly involved in
evaluating and/or using the information contained in the German documents,
as well as reports from the political and trade press, he arrived at a value
of $ 5 billion for the U.S. take.
By doubling this value to account for the
British 'acquisitions' he arrived at - surprise! - the $10 billion mentioned
by Mr. Molotov.
But this did not conclude the question of the value of the intellectual
know-how derived from German industry. In late 1946 and early 1947 various
German initiatives were started to evaluate the German losses. Up to this
point the Germans had only been repaid for copying costs of the documents,
obviously a ridiculously low sum. But the German efforts also failed as most
companies, even those hardest hit, refused to cooperate for tax reasons. In
other attempts the reported data could not be reduced to common denominators
to yield meaningful results.
Only after the new West German Government had agreed to forego any tax
investigations that might evolve from the reporting, did industry finally
comply.
A report, issued by the Notgemeinschaft für Reparationsgeschädigte
Industrie (Emergency Union of Industries Damaged by Reparations) in February
1951,
"estimated the total value of the patents,
trademarks, and other intellectual property ('geistiges Gut') removed
from Germany to be somewhere in the range of 10 to 30 billion
Deutschmarks (DM) not Reichsmark, the currency used in Germany prior to
its devaluation of 1949, or between $4.8 and $12 billion"
(9)
What was the actual value?
If we consider that the Library of Congress
still receives requests for copies of the German materials, more than 50
years after the War, primarily in the areas of dyestuffs, plastics, fuels,
and, more recently, for the location of industries, test ranges for guns and
ammunition, storage depots of chemical, biological, and explosive weapons
(for the purpose of localizing and sanitizing toxic soils) then, maybe, the
Commerce Department was right when it insisted that the value should be
based on the usefulness and actual use by American industry over an extended
period of time?
Other Foreign Documents
Obviously, the main interest in foreign information was concentrated on the
German collection: its size, the immediacy of collecting and processing, the
language (many American scientists and engineers still had studied German in
college), the fact that German industry before the war had been a main
competitor of many American companies, and that the Germans were renowned
for the quality of their research.
This also explains why Germany was
investigated so thoroughly.
From the very beginning, the situation involving Japanese information was
different: not many people could read Japanese and the systematic
investigation of Japanese industries did not begin until much later, giving
the Japanese industrialists a chance to sort out what they wanted to give
and what not. Also, as the mountains of German documents, along with
materials from U.S. and British sources started to pile up, the Japanese
documents were somewhat neglected.
In his Annual Report for 1947 the
Secretary of Commerce stated:
In addition to data from Germany, and documents from American sources, the
(Bibliographic and Reference) Division (of the Office of Technical Services)
is beginning to receive materials directly from Japan. Some of it consists
of up-to-date technological studies prepared by Japanese nationals on
subjects of interest to American industry.
Many wartime and pre-war Japanese publications
have also been received during the past year from the Washington Document
Center. This Center is the Washington processing office which was set up to
handle materials gathered in Japan by the military forces. Although much
material has already been received, a large part of it is now out of date
and of little value.
We have been assured, however, that valuable
documents from this source will reach us during the coming year. (10)
The Secretary continues:
The Belgian Government has voluntarily
contributed scientific reports to the Division. In addition, extremely
important material has been received from Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, Hungary, South Africa, Italy, and France.... The excellent
relations which OTS through this Division, has had with the British in
the exchange of reports is noteworthy.
At present the British
Intelligence Objective Subcommittee, commonly known as BIOS, maintains a
liaison office in Washington. Our work with this office might well be
cited as a fine example of international cooperation. The British have
generously provided large quantities of their printed reports and with
single microfilm copies of any of their manuscript reports which were
requested. They also provide a special reference service for this Office
and for American business firms.
We, on our part, provide a similar
service for the British. (11)
What Happened to the Documents?
We must not forget that the collectors were dealing with mountains of
material and that only a very small fraction was processed and filmed. Thus
the question has remained ever since "What happened to the rest?"
It is
still being asked today, especially if a researcher is interested in, let's
say, a particular camera made by the Leitz Company and he is looking for the
user manual.
In my search for the answers I have, over the decades, talked
to many people some of whom had been in the collecting and processing
effort.
"You cannot imagine, unless you had been there, how many documents
and single pages were scattered all over the floors, crammed into shelves,
stacked from floor to ceiling, falling over, spilling, it was utter chaos,"
I was told.
The filming was often equally wild: page after page the
documents were pulled through the machines , with quantity rather than
quality being the determining factor by untrained machine operators who did
the best they could under the circumstances. Quality control was
non-existent. The result was that some film rolls contain almost in their
entirety, only blurred, useless images. Also, when specialists wrote
reports, let's say on the 'German Optical Industry' the supporting documents
were, unless the were deemed important enough to be registered individually,
discarded; the same happened to translated documents.
Military and Nazi Party documents generally were brought to the United
States, sorted, filmed, and eventually returned to German archives. Books
and journals were, supposedly, turned over to the Library of Congress, but
we are not sure that we actually received all that was designated for the
Library.
According to Richard Eells, Acting Chief of the Aeronautics
Division,
"the Library, by agreement with the Air Material Command, Wright
Field, has become the depository for all purely historical and descriptive
portions of this captured material. The preliminary winnowing of the
shipment from Wright Field yielded 9,114 aeronautical books, periodicals,
and ephemera. In addition, more than 18,000 items representing the
literature of related fields were turned over to the Library for its general
collection.
Some of the confiscated libraries belonged to institutions that
loomed large in the history of the Luftwaffe: e.g., Junkers, Focke-Wulf, the
Deutsche Akademie der Luftfahrtforschung (German Academy for Aeronautical
Research), the Deutsche Forschungsinstitut für Segelflug (German Research
Institute for Gliding), the Flugfunkforschungsinstitut (Research Institute
for Aeronautical Radio), and the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (Air Ministry)
itself." (12)
During the past years I have inspected about two thirds of
the Library's aeronautical collection but found but a dozen or so volumes
having book plates ascribing them to the libraries of the institutes just
mentioned. This certainly does not add up to the 12,000 books from the
Junkers Aircraft Company Library alone that we supposedly received.
It is interesting to note that according to German newspaper reports
(13)
published after the war, the American officer in charge of the team
collecting the Junkers Library was none other than Charles Lindbergh, who
was no stranger to Hitler's Germany. Because of his friendship with Reichsmarschall
Hermann Göring and General Udet (he was later accused of
having been a Nazi sympathizer) many doors had opened to him in Nazi Germany
and he had visited and inspected the aircraft manufactured by Junkers
several times.
We must also remember that the Allies had much respect for
the German Luftwaffe and that one of the stipulations of the German
capitulation was that she would never again build an air force. Therefore,
all books and reports in German libraries that could be used to re-build the
Luftwaffe, were to be removed from Germany.
Now Dessau, where Junkers was
located, was to be in the designated Russian Zone - why would the Americans
leave a library of such importance to the Russians? So, what happened to
these libraries?
Eells, in the article cited (14) also mentions another important aspect:
A check of the Deutsche Nationalbibliographie indicates that the Library of
Congress has acquired many, if not all, of the commercial aeronautical
imprints in Germany during the war years.
One of the strengths of the Library of Congress before and for some decades
after the War was its aeronautical collection. Now, if we already had almost
all of the books contained in the Junkers and the other German libraries, we
would have made the rest either available to other interested American
libraries, or, on demand, returned the volumes to German archives (the
disappeared footlockers?).
Since the Junkers Aircraft Company, located in
the Russian Zone or the German Democratic Republic, did no longer exist
after 1945, who would have received the returned material? The Russians?

After World War One the Germans of America have become so disenfranchised
that they displayed the Stars and Stripes even in their own clubs, and sing
the American national anthem there louder than anywhere else! There were no
longer any clubs or associations that retained their German character or
consciousness.
American historians find that no more than one percent of the
German-Americans were "fanatical National Socialists" during and since the
war in 1940 a political periodical described America as the "mass grave of
the German emigrant".
German industrialists contributed extensively to the production of arms
against their country of origin.
In the Seattle assembly plants of the entrepreneur Boeing, whose origins are
in Hohenlimburg, the Flying Fortresses are built that drop 640,036 tons of
bombs on Germany. The Bechtels arm the navy. Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose
ancestor was driven out of the Odenwald for his pacifist views, is the
Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces, and Chester D. Nimitz, whose
grandparents were from Bremen, becomes Fleet Admiral.
Generals Krüger and
Eichelberger lead two armies, General Spaatz commands the bomber fleet, and
hundreds of thousands of soldiers of German extraction fight for America.
Additionally, after the war, the financiers Bernard Baruch and Henry
Morgenthau Jr. compete in the development of ideas for Germany's ultimate
annihilation. Baruch's ancestors were from East Prussia, the Morgenthaus
from Mannheim!
Regarding America's entry into the war under the leadership of Roosevelt,
the President who according to the unanimous verdict of all Revisionists
'tricked America into the war with lies', Joachim Fernau writes:
The 'Lusitania' had once cost 128 Americans their lives, but Roosevelt's
Pearl Harbor cost 4,000!
These were lives which this ambitious and cynical warmonger sacrificed in
cold blood in order to finally force his reluctant people "through the back
door" and into the war against the Axis powers!
In his 1947 book The Crime of Our Age about America's war politics, war aims
and political morals - a book which circulated widely in America even in the
highest political circles, including President Truman's - the American
Reverend Dr. Ludwig A. Fritsch writes:
In the presence of God I ask our nation, I ask you, ministers of the Gospel:
Did the Germans in all our histories ever inflict such injuries on us as we
did in the two World Wars and still do inflict on them? What wrong did the
German nation do to us Americans that we punished them twice in a generation
in the most cruel and inhuman way such as history never saw before? Do you
call that American gratitude for all the hard work and faithfulness by which
German people here built up our country and won our victories?
Of the German scientists and engineers who worked under
Wernher von Braun in Peenemünde to develop the V2 rocket and who surrendered to the Americans in
1945, some 120 went to America "voluntarily" as intellectual war booty.
Among them was the noteworthy scientist Dr. Rudolph, who was later - after
he had served his purpose! - banished again from the United States, even
though he held American citizenship!
Working in Huntsville, Alabama within
the framework of NASA, von Braun invented the propulsion system for the
Saturn V, making the 1969 "Apollo" trip to the moon possible. Martin
Schwarzschild, a professor who had immigrated from Potsdam in 1937, had
contributed substantially to this success. And even Neil Armstrong, "the
first man on the moon", was of German extraction - his ancestors were from Ladbergen in Westphalia.
Between 1951 and 1960 a new wave of immigrants arrived in America: almost
478,000 Germans and some 104,000 Austrians - and these were not a negative
selection, such as would be the case later on, in a different country, but
the cream of the crop, selected according to strict criteria! Additionally,
the American occupiers of post-war Germany brought several thousand German
women home as "war brides".
Most of these immigrants were people with
special qualifications, who no longer saw a future for themselves in their
homeland, destroyed as it had been by Anglo bombs. Another reason for the
hopelessness experienced by these unemployed Germans is to be found in the
post-war dismantling of vital German industries, as well as in the influx of
millions of Germans fleeing from Stalin's Red hordes.
Reverend Fritsch comments on this post-war situation:
The extradition and presentation of entire countries and nations to the
Russians by Roosevelt; the senseless and deliberate destruction of the most
magnificent cities; the most cruel expulsion of millions of Eastern-Germans
from their century old homes; the development and the execution of the
Eisenhower-Morgenthau-Roosevelt plan, the most inhuman act of revenge since
there is a recorded history; the slow and painful murdering of 20-30 million
human beings by starvation, cold and privation.
Those are not political
'mistakes' as our leaders now want us to believe; they are conscious,
deliberate, premeditated crimes!
In 1987 the American Congress declared October 6 to be "German American
Day", an empty gesture since the Germans continue to be the States' only,
yet largest, minority with no voice. But at least at that time reference was
still made to the countless contributions Germans made to America's
development (a subject which is now an absolute taboo again).
According to Längin, there was a certain recollection that,
"Walter Chrysler (Kreisler)
had founded the automobile manufacturing company that is named for him; that
Martin Brill from Kassel had established the largest manufactory of street
cars, Johann Bausch and Heinrich Lomb the foremost manufactory of optical
lenses, and Karl Pfizer from Ludwigsburg a leading drug company.
Charles
Schwab and Henry Flick are regarded as giants of the steel industry, and the
Viennese Charles Bluhdorn was co-founder and President of Gulf & Western
Industries. Frank A. Seibelring, a descendant of immigrants from Stuttgart,
was the founding father of the company Goodyear, and the ancestors of his
main competitor Harvey Firestone (these are the two largest American rubber
manufacturers; ed.) were Austrians who had immigrated via Alsace.
Hermann
Hollerith introduced the first electric calculating machine in his adopted
homeland, and in 1942 the Viennese woman Hedy Lamarr (actually Hedwig
Kiesler) received the patent for a torpedo guidance system."
"The opinion of history remains divided," adds Längin. "The German sickness,
namely a lack of group consciousness, is the formula that facilitates a
rapid and thoughtless assimilation into the host society, which quickly
turns the German into the 'Anglo monkey' and the United States into the
'graveyard of the Germans'."
The historian Lamprecht comments in a similar
vein:
"The Germans have failed as Germans," and no Oktoberfest with
lederhosen, chamois hat decorations, yodeling and beer can whitewash that!
The question remains whether the demise of America's most numerous,
efficient and probably also most decent ethnic group with the lowest crime
rate of all is the consequence primarily of German naiveté and lack of
political ability, or of a large-scale, clever exploitation of German energy
and expertise by the politically savvy Anglo-Saxon leadership elite.
Regarding the crimes committed by America against the Germans as well as
other peoples in both world wars and since, Reverend Dr. Fritsch expresses
the educated German-American view thus:
All these tremendous might and power and profits were achieved at the lowest
price in comparison to the appalling damage and the irreparable loss we
inflicted on our 'enemies.' Hitherto we were in our whole history the lucky
winners of all our aggressive wars against the Indians, the English,
Spaniards, Mexicans, Japanese and twice against the Germans. In this last
gigantic struggle of nations we have lost only as many human lives as we
have at home by accidents.
The American Red Cross in 1945 reported
officially that '99 per cent of the American prisoners of war in Germany
have survived and are on their way home!' (In contrast to this fact we have
sent not 1 per cent of our German prisoners of war home, but we traded them
as slaves to France and England!) Concerning the 260 billions - the cost of
Roosevelt's war - it is more than paid off through the patent secrets and
art treasures and scientists stolen and kidnapped from the Germans.
Thus we
have only profited from all the wars we waged while at the same time we
inflicted on mankind unspeakable misery and bitter disappointments. The
greatest of all sins in the presence of God and in the light of history that
we as a nation have committed is making ourselves guilty of matricide.
Europe is our physical and spiritual mother.
But most of all we should
appreciate and honor that nation whose sons' and daughters' blood and sweat
mostly had flowed for our country: the German. Is it not true that in every
third American's veins flows Teutonic blood?
And as for the possibilities of a Germany left in peace,
Reverend Fritsch
writes:
"In my opinion the Germans would have broken the eccentricities of Hitlerism
after they had reached their goal - unification of all Germans. Their unique
ability to organize would have created order and tranquility in Europe and
in the World in the shortest possible time. They would have created the
United States of Europe without bloodshed.
They would have placed their
great capabilities in the fields of science, arts and technology to the
disposition of the whole world as they did before. Their deep spiritual life
would have enriched and ennobled mankind, as for example the unique German
music and hymns heretofore did."
With regard to the jealous fear of competition that characterizes England,
the nation Hitler (oddly enough) admired so much, he writes:
Germany was at that time at the zenith of her might, fame and reputation.
She built the greatest and most luxurious ships of the world with which she
gained the world market, because she was able to supply the best and
cheapest production. In the realm of science Germany was ahead of all
nations of the world.
Her scientists had more Nobel-Prizes in all spheres of
science than all the other nations combined. From all countries of the globe
the seekers of knowledge and lovers of art came to the famous universities
of the 'people of poets and thinkers.' But the might and greatness of
Germany was at the same time envied and suspected.
England, feeling that she
was put back to play the second fiddle in world affairs, in her insatiable
greediness worked so hard and so long until she succeeded in surrounding
Germany with enemies. Europe became a powder keg. Only the spark was
necessary to make her explode.
The world became ablaze. For the second time!
For even regarding the earlier great European fraternal
war, Fritsch observed:
When our soldiers returned home and after they had seen the sad consequences
of our intervention in the European quarrel they cried out: 'We fought on
the wrong side!'
