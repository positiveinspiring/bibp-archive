A police officer
ordered by the government to rob the people.
It happened before and it is starting again.
Government confiscating (stealing) the peoples life savings.
Just like in 1929 the British government began
its theft of the peoples life savings just before the Great Depression.
After an inflationary run-up in prices and asset values, the stock market
crashed in 1929, and the economy soon went with the crash. This time the
British government is disguising its outright theft by claiming the entire
contents of safety deposit banks are owned by criminals and the contents are
the proceeds of crimes.
In March of 2011 the British Prime Minister David Cameron ordered
British police to execute
Operation Rize - raid and seize the entire contents (art,
gold ingots, gold dust, jewelry and cash) of nearly 7,000 safety deposit
boxes from three vaults in London.
The British government simply told
Scotland Yard that the safety deposit boxes were used by criminals to store
cash, guns and drugs.
The British government instructed the police to arrest anyone who went to
the vaults to try and recover the contents of their safety deposit boxes.
Those who protested the seizure of the contents of their safety deposit
boxes were to be charged with various offenses including pedophilia,
money-laundering, drug-dealing and firearms possession.
When word spread about the government raid and theft of the contents of
their safety deposit boxes people rushed to the bank vaults.
The police arrested 146 and charged 30 (those
with the most cash and gold in their safety deposit boxes) with trumped up
pedophilia, money-laundering, drug-dealing and firearms charges.
Armed robbery of bank safety
deposit boxes by London Police
This isnt the first time the British government
ordered the seizure of its peoples deposits.
Back in June 2008, 1 year after the global
economic crisis began, police armed with automatic weapons (shown in above
image) were ordered by Gordon Brown to seize (to take by force) thousands of
deposit boxes, ranging from small book-sized boxes to large walk-in safes in
a string of west London raids.
Armed robbery is defined as a crime,
involving the use of a weapon in the taking of money or goods in the
possession of another, from his or her person or immediate presence.
The contents of safety deposit boxes were stolen by the British government
from,
-
Park Lane Safe Depository in Park Street
-
Hampstead Safe Depository in Finchley
Road
-
Edgware Safe Depository in High Street, Edgware
The British government came up with the idea back in 2006.
The British government needed new money and the
only new and real money was being held by the people in safety deposit
boxes. The government cant tax what is sitting for years in thousands of
safety deposit boxes so they decided to confiscate it all.
The confiscation
of the peoples money was codenamed
Operation Rize.
Operation Rize being code for Ruse. The ruse is
the British government labeling all safety deposit box owners as criminals
in order to steal the valuable contents of their safety deposit boxes. Every
safety deposit box in the largest vaults in London were ordered raided based
entirely on the British governments assertion that a handful of safety
deposit box owners were suspected of being corrupt.
Why is this significant for people in the United States? The U.S. government
is preparing to do the same in the United States.
The U.S. government has been stealing its peoples money since 2008 and the
only real money ($trillions) left in the United States is being kept in its
peoples safety deposit boxes. The U.S. government has lost its prized AAA
rating and the S&P made it known that it could drop it again in November.
Yesterday, Guan Jianzhong, chairman of Dagong
Global Credit Rating, said the U.S. currency (the worthless Federal Reserve
Note) is being,
gradually discarded by the world, and the
process will be irreversible.
Because of the rating downgrade and foreign
governments dropping the worthless Federal Reserve Note, the U.S. government
is being forced by the
Federal Reserve
bankers to make preparations to
confiscate the peoples valuable financial assets held in safety deposit
boxes across the U.S. by using the same false accusation as the British
government - all safety deposit box owners are criminals and the contents of
those boxes deemed to be criminal proceeds.
Government confiscation (theft) of its peoples gold dates back to the
Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917.
In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson was forced by
the bankers of the newly formed Federal Reserve to sign the TWEA into law,
forbidding American individuals and businesses from engaging in trade with
enemy nations.
The worlds functional gold standard, which had
overseen tremendous global economic growth in the early years of the
twentieth century, was effectively halted by the Federal Reserve bankers and
the outbreak of World War I soon followed. With gold no longer being the
standard for trade (the worthless counterfeit Federal Reserve Note replaced
it) the stage was thus set for the Great Depression and World War II.
Shortly after taking office sixteen years later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
was forced by the Federal Reserve bankers to sign
Executive Order 6102 (below image) into
law, prohibiting the hoarding of gold.
Under this
Federal Reserve order,
Americans were prohibited from owning more than $100 worth of gold coins,
and all hoarders (i.e. people who owned more than $100 worth of gold) were
forced, by law, to sell their excess gold to the Federal Reserve bankers
at the prevailing price of $20.67 per ounce.
Then, once the Federal Reserve bankers had all the gold, FDR revalued the
dollar relative to gold so that gold was now worth $35 an ounce.
By simple decree, the Federal Reserve bankers
had thereby robbed millions of American citizens at a rate of $14.33 per
ounce of confiscated gold, which is why most historians agree that the
Gold
Confiscation of 1933 was the single most draconian economic act in the
history of the United States - that is until the Federal Reserve bankers did
it again 75 years later.
On November 24, 2008, U.S. Republican Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX)
wrote,
In bailing out failing companies, they are
confiscating money from productive members of the economy and giving it
to failing ones.
By sustaining companies with obsolete or
unsustainable business models, the government prevents their resources
from being liquidated and made available to other companies that can put
them to better, more productive use.
An essential element of a healthy free
market, is that both success and failure must be permitted to happen
when they are earned.
But instead with a bailout, the rewards are
reversed - the proceeds from successful entities are given to failing
ones. How this is supposed to be good for our economy is beyond me
It
wont work. It cant work
It is obvious to most Americans that we need
to reject corporate cronyism, and allow the natural regulations and
incentives of the free market to pick the winners and losers in our
economy, not the whims of bureaucrats and politicians.
