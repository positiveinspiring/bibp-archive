# India's Gargantuan Biometric Database Raises Big Questions

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_bigbrother121.htm

The government of India has
amassed a database of 200 million Indian residents'
digital fingerprints, iris scans, facial photographs,
names, addresses and birthdates.
Yet this vast collection of
private information is only a drop in the bucket
compared to the volume of data it ultimately intends to
gather.
The Unique Identity Authority of India (UIDAI),
the agency that administers
Aadhaar - India's Unique
Identity (UID) program - has a goal of capturing and
storing this personal and biometric information for each
and every one of India's 1.2 billion residents.
Everyone who enrolls is
issued a 12-digit unique ID number and an ID card linked
to the data.
Once its complete, the
Aadhaar system will require so much data storage
capacity that it is projected to be 10 times the size of Facebook. And while it's optional to enroll, the program
is envisioned as the basis for new mobile apps that
would facilitate everything from banking transactions to
the purchase of goods and services, which could make it
hard for individuals to opt out without getting left
behind.
Indias is the largest
biometric ID scheme in the world, and the massive
undertaking raises serious questions about widespread
data sharing, a lack of legal protections for users
data, and concerns about whether adequate technical
safeguards are in place to keep individuals information
safe and secure.
Recently, EFF attended a
talk by Srikanth Nadhamuni, a technologist and one of
the programs chief architects, at UC Berkeleys
Center for
Southeast Asian Studies.
While he characterized
Aadhaar as a cutting-edge tool for fighting corruption
and assisting the rural poor, EFF has concerns about the
privacy implications of this sweeping effort.
Is
Biometric Collection Necessary to Achieve the Program's
Goals?
Nadhamuni framed Aadhaar as
a program that could alleviate the plight of Indias
rural poor, a large subset of the population that lacks
reliable access to government services.
The city governments
were still being run by leather-bound books and
pen, he explained.
Not using technology to
improve service delivery was something that we
wanted to change
The thought that I had was, if we
could embed a unique number for each baby that was
born, and that number got used in all the different
applications, then that service delivery could
improve.
Once you have enrolled yourself, then you
can go and buy your rations, or banking
transactions, and so on, using authentication.
Nadhamuni said UID would
serve to eliminate fraud in circumstances where it is
now impossible to verify individuals' identities.
He described the tedious and
costly weekly journey of a laborer to cash a paycheck to
illustrate how UID could be used to make peoples' lives
more convenient.
He described a system in
which UID numbers would spur the development of mobile
phone apps, which would allow vendors to scan
fingerprints on a handheld device to use UID
authentication for all kinds of purposes and
transactions.
When evaluating biometric
systems, it's important to determine whether the
collection and processing of personal information fit
with the program's stated objectives.
The goal of assisting the
rural poor is well-intentioned, but the means Nadhamuni
is proposing to achieve this end should be carefully
examined. It's also worth asking why, if the stated
objective is to aid the rural poor, the UIDAI intends to
extend Aadhaar's reach to each and every one of India's
1.2 billion residents.
EFF remains concerned about
the problems inherent in centralized biometric ID
databases, systems that have been met with resistance
elsewhere and, in the case of Britain, even
dismantled in the face of public outcry stemming
from privacy concerns.
The creation of such a
system raises concerns about the security of users'
highly sensitive personal information. Nadhamuni said
very little about whether there is a contingency plan in
the case of a data breach, like the one that transmitted
Israel's
entire population database onto the Internet in a
freely available format.
What happens if people start
to
spoof fingerprint scanners, which German hackers
have already proven is a relatively easy feat? What if
identity thieves take it a step farther, by spoofing
iris scanners (which Javier Galbally
showed was possible at the Black Hat Security
Conference this past summer)?
Unlike a PIN code, a
fingerprint or an iris is impossible to cancel and
re-issue.
A
Centralized Unique ID System is Risky
Nadhamuni seemed to accept
without question that implementing a universal ID card
would benefit India.
There is no standard
identity document in India, he said.
He justified the collection
of biometric data by saying that insurmountable overlap
between existing governmental databases makes it
impossible to create a unique database by merging all
existing data sets.
Yet the assumption that
there is an inherent need for a governmental framework
that would aggregate all individuals personal
information in one place should not go unchallenged.
There are fundamental flaws in a system with a
centralized database at its core, which grants a
disproportionate amount of control to a single
governmental entity that collects and stores the
information.
Regardless of the security
precautions Nadhamuni assured would be in place, the
creation of such a database inevitably creates a
honeypot of sensitive information that becomes a natural
target for would-be criminals.
India has no data privacy
protection law to speak of, and the fact that this
program is moving ahead in the absence of such a
safeguard is problematic, particularly given the
widespread data-sharing that is contemplated under this
endeavor. Similar proposals have run into legal trouble.
In March 2012, the
Conseil Constitutionnel, the highest authority on
the French Constitution,
declared the provisions of a law permitting judicial
and police use of a centralized national ID database to
be unconstitutional.
In other countries, we've
seen how biometric data can ultimately be used for
purposes other than stated intentions.
In Argentina, for instance,
a new centralized, nationwide biometric ID will allow
law enforcement to
cross-reference information with biometric and
other data initially collected for the purpose of
operating a general national ID registry.
This reverses the
traditional practice of limiting police fingerprint
databases to those suspected or convicted of criminal
offences.
Once it is built, an
enormous system based on the personal information of 1.2
billion people can begin to serve all manner of
previously unimagined purposes.
What's more, Nadhamuni
suggested biometric identification with Aadhaar could
become a convenient part of everyday life:
the UIDAI lets private
parties accept the IDs and verify their content
online, for outsourced financial transactions or
authenticating users for third-party applications.
For example, people could
have their fingerprints scanned on a shopkeeper's mobile
device as a way of paying for items at a shop.
It's astonishing to think
that the enormous flows of data that would result from
these applications - and the associated potential for
monitoring Indians' physical whereabouts and day-to-day
lives - would come with few legal safeguards.
Beware of
Function Creep
A telling moment in
Nadhamhunis lecture came when an audience member asked
whether Aadhaar would be used for national security
purposes.
I don't know about the
linkage between UID and security, Nadhamuni
responded.
I was head of
technology, and the specification that I was given
was to build a system for social inclusion and the
poor. So if there's a linkage, I don't know of it,
and so I can't comment on what that linkage is.
It's disappointing that he
didn't say more, particularly given
this New York Times op-ed by Indian journalist Aman
Sethi suggesting that national security was at the root
of a government initiative to collect biometric ID that
predates Aadhaar and is now moving ahead in sync with
the UID program.
Function creep - when a
program is introduced for one purpose and ultimately
used for another - is a serious consideration when
assessing biometric ID systems.
What will happen when data
collected by the UIDAI is used in conjunction with a
governmental surveillance program or national security
initiative? So far, this question remains unanswered,
but there are good reasons to be concerned.
This colossal, IT-driven
effort is moving forward without adequate transparency
or public dialogue, and its no wonder that activists
have pushed back against the idea in India.
Internet policy researcher
Sunil Abraham, of the Bangalore-based Center for
Internet and Society, has voiced concerns over Aadhaars
identification system and proposed alternatives that
would be far less privacy-invasive.
"Privacy protections
should be inversely proportional to power," Abraham
wrote in a
Business Standard op-ed.
"The transparency
demanded of politicians, bureaucrats and large
corporations cannot be made mandatory for ordinary
citizens. Surveillance must be directed at
big-ticket corruption, at the top of the pyramid and
not retail fraud at the bottom. Even for retail
fraud, the power asymmetry will result in corruption
innovating to circumvent technical safeguards.
Government officials
should be required by law to digitally sign the
movement of resources each step of the way till it
reaches a citizen. Open data initiatives should make
such records available for public scrutiny. With
support from civil society and the media, citizens
will themselves address retail fraud.
To solve corruption, the
state should become more transparent to the citizen
and not vice versa."
A biometric data collection
program of this scale, particularly in the absence of an
existing data protection law, presents serious risks to
individuals privacy.
Rather than improving
peoples lives, Aadhaar could place their highly
sensitive personal information at risk.
