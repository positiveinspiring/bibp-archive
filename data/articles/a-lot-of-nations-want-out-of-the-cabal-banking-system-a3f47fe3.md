The secret cabal's control
over international markets
is becoming less of a mystery
as increasing numbers of markets
reveal themselves so obviously to be
fixed.
Just in case you haven't been keeping up with
the 'tin-foil' hat conspiracies, increasingly proven to be true, the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, is the center of a secret
global economy that has bailed out,
...among others.
The secret cabal's
control over international markets is becoming less of a mystery as
increasing numbers of markets reveal themselves so obviously to be fixed.
The cabal cheats the 99 percent with Libor interest rates, foreign
exchanges, and gold, silver, and platinum price fixing.
Then there's high-frequency trading (HFT), where
Wall Street banks use supercomputers to monitor incoming stock market
orders, analyze their likely impact on prices, and place orders ahead of
those trades to capture a bit of the price impact, called 'stealing' if it
were properly named.
HFT data helps to explain the frenzy
in today's markets:
The most aggressive firms tend to earn the
biggest profits, hence the incentive to trade as quickly and as often as
possible.
Furthermore, these traders make their money at
the expense of everyone else, including less-aggressive high- frequency
traders. It is simply the latest and greatest scam on stock holders looking
for real value in a company, thinking they can compete with the big guys.
Just a few weeks ago, 132 nations decided
they've had enough of the 'secret' money jig we've all been dancing to.
One of the largest coalitions of developing
nations in history has urged Secretary-General of
the United Nations Ban
Ki-moon, to provide,
"as soon as possible
alternative options
for banking services."
132 countries, including China are done with the
funny money scheme. This comes on the heels of a mass cancellation of bank
accounts in U.N. missions and those of foreign US diplomats.
The G77
urges the secretary-general to review the,
"U.N. Secretariat's financial relations with
the JP Morgan Chase Bank and consider alternatives to such financial
institutions and to report thereon, along with the information
requested."
JP Morgan is the left arm of the cabal, along
with other 'big banks' who were benefactors of billions in our tax money.
They have shorted
silver along with Citibank to increase their physical silver holdings by
500%. They are also the 'big bank,' along with Chase that failed to stop
Ponzi-schemer
Bernard Madoff.
Why do that? He was cut from the same clothe as
their top executives.
JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie
Dimon pleaded with and complained to the U.S. Justice Department a few
years back but couldn't convince the government to end its criminal probe of
his bank because prosecutors couldn't figure out just how crooked this
banking system really was.
Banks like these helped
crash our economies, and they are trying to do the same now, so that
they can profit from it.
The problem for countries around the world is
simple:
Chase bank currently handles billions in accounts maintained by the
United Nations and its agencies, in guess where... NEW YORK CITY.
The countries express a 'deep concern' over the
decisions made by several other banking institutions, known puppets for the
cabal, including JP Morgan Chase, in closing bank accounts for mostly
developing countries.
The resolution proposed, still subject to
amendments cites a 1947 agreement between the US and UN, which:
"...guarantees the rights, obligations
and the fulfillment of responsibilities by member states towards the
United Nations, under the United Nations Charter and international law."
It also points out the 1961 Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations as a regulatory framework for states and international
organizations, specifically the working relationship between the United
Nations and the City of New York.
The countries have put forth
the G77 as a means to utilize,
"all necessary measures to ensure permanent
missions accredited to the United Nations and their staff are granted
equal, fair and non-discriminatory treatment by the banking system."
At secret meetings around the G77 last month,
representative after representative from these countries severely criticized
the American banking system from cutting off banking services from the
diplomatic community, specifically directing their outrage at JP Morgan
Chase (formerly Chemical Bank).
The accounts were closed when a request from the
US treasury asked banks to report every single transaction of 70
'blacklisted' diplomats as part of a monitoring system, just a new way that bankers
are spying on all of us.
Aside from a network of cameras, run buy
the NSA,
and a program with a codename of 'Dishfire'
they also now indulge in practices which make you no different than
America's 'enemies,' or diplomats of emerging economies sick of being
bullied by the petro-dollar:
-
Every time you
swipe your credit or debit card, the transaction is scored to
gauge the risk of fraud.
-
Banks use 'behavior' scores to figure
out how you consume and deny you credit or increase your mortgage
rates based on that behavior.
-
Deposit behavior is also gauged. If you
save a little or a lot, they are watching that and plugging in the
data to determine whether or not to lend you more funny money.
-
Investments and income are assessed
utilizing a 'wealth estimator.' This also affects what financial
products you have access to, and what you will pay for them.
-
Both US
and UK spy agencies avert internet encryption to look at your
private emails, medical information and banking habits.
