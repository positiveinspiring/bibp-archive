Sergio De Gregorio
Silvio Berlusconi
Former Italian senator Sergio De Gregorio
confirmed over the weekend that hed been bribed by Silvio Berlusconi
in 2006.
The Cavaliere paid me, he told
La Stampa nonchalantly about the 3 million hed received. Of
course I took the money, as I clarified to the prosecutors, he said.
Utterly frustrated with this sort of daily
display of corruption in their country, 8.7 million angry Italians from all
walks of life voted for Beppe Grillos 5-Star movement.
While 25.5% of the popular vote isnt nearly
enough to govern without being part of a coalition, which he has so far
rejected, its enough to give the political establishment conniptions - and
show that anger and frustration finally count.
The existing political class must be
expelled immediately, he told the
New York Times.
Hence his refusal to form a coalition. He wants
the political system to collapse.
From it, hed construct something new,
something truly democratic.
We can change everything in the hands of
respectable people, he explained.
But wasnt it reckless to try to destroy the
system?
How can we be accused of destroying
something thats already destroyed? he asked. Theyve devoured the
country, and now they cant govern.
He called Berlusconi of the right-leaning PDL a
psycho dwarf and Pier Luigi Bersani, the top honcho of the left-leaning
Democratic Party,
a dead man walking.
Italys political system would collapse, he told
the German online magazine
Focus.
I give the old parties six months, and then
its over.
In the subsequent elections, the 5-Star movement
could get enough votes to govern - and to clean house.
He also demanded the renegotiation of Italys
debt.
Were being crushed, not by the euro, but
by our debt.
A government is like a corporation that goes
bankrupt. Investors are simply out of luck.
They took a risk and lost, he said, having
earned a degree in accounting. And if the conditions arent changed, he
added, Italy would leave the euro and return to the Lira.
Then he was talking with the tabloid
Bild, the largest circulation paper in Germany - hed become an equal
opportunity mainstream-media darling. The Bild pushed him about
Merkels demand that Italy continue on Prime Minister Mario Montis path of
reforms and austerity.
He brushed it off.
"What Monti had done wasnt real austerity," he
said.
Instead of taking something from the
already privileged, particularly politicians, he helped himself to the
savings of families who now, without this money, no longer know how they
can go on.
Himself a convinced European, he wants an
online referendum on the euro.
Though non-binding under Italian law, results
would be difficult to ignore.
In one year, we wont have enough money to
pay pensions and wages of those who work in the public sector.
One year!
During the Focus interview the day before, it was half a year. But hey. Its
the principle that counts. Hed been lambasting the Italian political
system and the established parties for years - and it has struck a chord
with voters.
As if to drive home the point, just after the
election, Berlusconis corruption scandal bubbled to the surface with Sergio
De Gregorios admission that,
The Cavaliere paid me, underlined
by, Of course I took the money.
The Cavaliere allegedly funneled 3
million to De Gregorio in 2006 to get him to switch parties, which resulted
in the collapse of the center-left coalition government under Prime Minister
Romano Prodi.
In the subsequent election, Berlusconi won. Last
Thursday, it seeped out that prosecutors in Naples were investigating
Berlusconi and others for corruption and illegal financing of political
parties.
Prodi called it an assassination of democracy.
Gregorio told
La Stampa that hed decided to cooperate with prosecutors when it became
clear to him that the new members of parliament, the Grillini, as the media
dubbed them, were demanding a sort of Nuremberg for Politicians,
reminiscent of
the Nuremberg Trials for the Nazis.
I didnt want to go down in history as the
senator who leaves the Palazzo Madama - the palace in Rome where the
Senate meets - in handcuffs.
De Gregorio isnt exactly a paragon of innocence
temporarily gone astray: he has been investigated in the past for money
laundering and corruption.
Suspicions are floating around that he is
connected to the Mafia. But now he is afraid the new members of parliament
might try to clean house. The 5-Star movement doesnt have much of a
structure yet, and no experienced MPs - they, like their electorate, come
from all walks of life and were picked during the primaries through internet
voting.
The movement might have trouble bringing down,
as Grillo hopes, the political establishment that was designed to survive
these kinds of democratic groundswells; it had been able to form governing
coalitions before, even when election results were complicated.
But alone the fact that the 5-Star movement
gives De Gregorio and perhaps others visions of Nuremberg Trials for
politicians is a glorious achievement.
Im appalled that two clowns have won,
said the man whod try to knock Merkel off her perch later this year.
He was referring to former comedian Grillo and
former Prime Minister Berlusconi.
One of them is,
a professional clown who doesnt mind being
called that, he explained; the other is a clown with special
testosterone boost.
