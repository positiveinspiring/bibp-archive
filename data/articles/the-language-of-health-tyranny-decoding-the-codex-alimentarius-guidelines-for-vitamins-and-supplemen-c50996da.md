"Codex Alimentarius - The End of
Health Freedom"
Perhaps the most publicized aspect of
Codex Alimentarius is the threat it poses
to free access to vitamin and mineral supplements.
While there are varying opinions on the effects
the Codex guidelines would have on dietary supplements, there is little
debate about the fact that these effects would be detrimental.
At best, the guidelines will reduce dose levels
to minuscule amounts too small to be beneficial, as well as causing the
prices to skyrocket for both consumers and producers.[1]
However, a more frightening scenario is possible and, unfortunately, quite
likely. When one examines the evidence, it is clear that the effects of the
Codex guidelines will do more than just reduce the level of nutrients
available in supplements. The truth is that it will actually go so far as to
list vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other nutrients as toxins, while at the
same time listing dangerous chemicals as nutrients.
The committee charged with completing this task is the Codex Committee on
Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses (CCNFSDU), chaired by Dr.
Rolf Grossklaus, until recently.
In 2005, and in the face of much opposition from
the informed pro-supplement and natural health community, the CCNFSDU
approved The Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements, the set of
rules by which vitamin and mineral supplements may very well be removed from
the market.[2]
The Natural Health Federation (NHF) and the Alliance for Natural
Health (ANH) have traditionally been the most vocal opponents of Codexs
attempts.
However, it appears that these organizations, as
well as the many others that oppose Codex such as the Natural Solutions
Foundation (NSF), are fighting a losing battle. While these groups and
individuals spend countless amounts of money and energy fighting this global
tyranny, their efforts amount to little more than rearranging the deck
chairs on the titanic.
At this point, their work focuses on lessening
the blow from the Codex guidelines. Unfortunately, it does nothing to stop
the blow from coming, nor does it protect against subsequent heavier blows.
While these statements are not meant to belittle their work, it is meant to
show that the battle is not within Codex itself, but outside of it.
That said, the idea that nutrients (vitamins and minerals) will be
considered as toxins is not readily apparent even when reading the actual
guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements.
Nowhere in the guidelines is it stated that
nutrients will be listed as toxins. However, as with most governmental and
institutional mandates, it is hidden within coded language and meticulous
directives.
Such a technicality exists in this instance in
the form of risk assessment; the technique specified by Codex to evaluate
the safety of vitamin and mineral supplements.
In section 3.2.2 (a), the
Guidelines state:
Upper safe levels of vitamins and minerals
[should be] established by scientific risk assessment based on generally
accepted scientific data, taking into consideration, as appropriate, the
varying degrees of sensitivity of different consumer groups. [3]
Risk assessment, while seemingly benign, is
actually crucial to the ability of Codex to justify the ban of vitamin and
mineral supplements.
This concept works on the assumption that the
item being tested is inherently dangerous and toxic. This method is
completely the opposite of what should be used when evaluating vitamins and
minerals.
As Dr. Rima Laibow states in her article
"'Nutraceuticide' and Codex Alimentarius:"
This use of risk assessment, of course,
represents a major deflection from the real use and value of risk
assessment, which is to make sure that people are not exposed to the
dangerous industrial chemicals that have serious and sometimes lethal
effects on them and their children.[4]
By applying scientific risk assessment to
nutrients and supplements, they are essentially considering them toxins as
they are lumped into the same category as chemicals and poisons.
There is no need to explicitly state that
nutrients are toxins. This is done by default.
So, in the end, we have the categorization of
vitamins and minerals that are essential to human health and life as
something that is actually toxic. In this sense, we are entering the world
of doublethink.
Regardless, this is the position of Codex, as well as the position of the
U.S. Delegation throughout the discussion.[5]
Indeed, even many alleged health freedom
International Non-Governmental Organizations were either gullible enough to
be taken in by the promise of the benefits of risk assessment, or morally
bankrupt enough to be bought off by the pharmaceutical industry or others
who might benefit from the demise of the natural supplement industry.
Yet, some of the support for risk assessment
methods early on seems to have been based on the fear of the implementation
of maximum limits proposed by European countries like France. These limits
would have reduced the potency level of each pill to no more than 15%
Recommended Daily Intake (RDI), a figure that is already set much too
low. [6]
Yet those who favored risk assessment seemed to
jump from the frying pan into the fire. As Scott Tips of the Natural Health
Federation writes:
The so-called 'science-based risk assessment' for establishing Safe Upper
Limits (maximum levels) for vitamin-and-mineral potencies, to which the EU
has agreed, and about which the Americans are as happy as flies on cow dung,
is nothing but a trap.
The Americans think that they will be able to
get real science to establish high maximum levels for their vitamins and
minerals and then sell them to European consumers by the bushels.
But by the time the Europeans get through
applying their science, those maximum limits will be so low toddlers would
be lucky to get any nutritional value out of Codex-harmonized vitamins and
minerals. The European Unions Scientific Committee on Food has already
started using its science-based risk assessment to establish laughably low
maximum limits for European vitamins.
And, lately, I have begun to see a growing
concern, if not outright fear, in the faces of some science-based
risk-assessment proponents that perhaps things might not go their way here
after all.[7]
Indeed, things are not going their way.
That is, if the general wish is
that Codex would offer up new trade opportunities for American supplement
manufacturers in the form of a new European market. To be sure, it takes monumental ignorance to
actually believe this.
Nevertheless, trade associations like the,
-
International Alliance of Dietary Food
Supplements
-
National Nutritional Foods Association
-
the Council for Responsible Nutrition,
...are proclaiming that Codex poses no threat to
their access to supplements and, specifically, to the DSHEA law which was
passed in 1994.
In general, those individuals who rely on these organizations for their
knowledge of the legal and political workings of the industry take these
reports as truth, trusting them as credible sources.
It should also be noted that it is widely known
that members of various natural health/supplement trade organizations are
increasingly being purchased by the pharmaceutical industry themselves.
Once this is acknowledged, one can understand
more fully how disinformation spreads around the supplement community and
encourages apathy and a false sense of security among the populace.[8]
Maximum Upper Limits on vitamins will be set for the few temporarily
remaining nutrients as well as the complete removal of others from
multi-vitamin supplements. The ramifications for human health and national
sovereignty will therefore be extremely destructive.
As always, this global domination and subversion
of national sovereignty will be done in the name of trade, and the true aims
of the perpetrators will be cloaked in flowery language, wordplay, and
semantics.
It will also be done right under our noses.
