US President
Barack Obama has announced he will
attend the G20 summit in St. Petersburg this September.
A meeting between Russian and US defense and
foreign ministers will also be scheduled for later this week in Washington.
Although Obama canceled Wednesday his Moscow summit with Russian President
Vladimir Putin ahead of the G20 summit, it is a relatively
insignificant change.
The US has apparently accepted the fact that
Russia granted one-year asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward
Snowden. Russia has impressed the world, which views the Kremlin as the
"winner" and the White House as the "loser."
This judgment is correct.
In
the Snowden case, all the other countries
involved have become winners while the US is the sole loser. Washington put
on a show of bravado, but failed to extradite Snowden in the end. By
contrast, Moscow displayed its national characteristics of decisiveness and
boldness and kept Washington at bay.
Many Chinese netizens believe China should have done so, but China only
showed hesitation and weakness.
If China had Snowden in its care, a big change in its attitude toward
Sino-US relations would have been brought and China would have had to
undertake risks associated with such a change.
Yet China ostensibly chose to not interfere.
Now, the decision seems to have generated better
results. Some of the US' hypocritical national policies were exposed, and
Snowden was not extradited to the US. International opinion is scathing of
the US in information security issues. At the same time, Sino-US relations
have not been greatly affected.
Moscow has consolidated its tough diplomatic attitude toward Washington and
drawn closer in diplomatic status when a gap still exists in terms of the
actual strength of the two.
Moscow is willing to take the lead in the
Snowden case and has experience in doing so. This perfectly fits Beijing's
interests.
Everyone knows the competition between China and the US is key to 21st
century international relations. But China's strength still lags far behind
that of the US. As China's comprehensive strategic partner, Russia took the
initiative in the Snowden case and came to the forefront of the rivalry with
the US, which shows multipolar flexibility in global geopolitics.
Russia's action deserves respect from China.
China is not willing to engage in a head-on confrontation with the US, but
it has already had the ability to unite with those who can restrict the US'
abuses of power. We did not confront the US directly, and this serves the
long-term interests of China's diplomacy.
Washington ate the dirt this time, but it does not necessarily mean it is
really awed by Moscow.
In the same manner, Washington is unlikely to
fear Beijing, and Beijing needn't fear Washington. What Beijing should care
about most is how to maximize its interests in its relations with
Washington.
Snowden can do more in a country like Russia.
The performance that has disgraced the U.S.
is far from over...
