WASHINGTON
Some of the richest men and women in the world
met secretly recently in New York to conspire on using their vast wealth to
bring the worlds population growth under control.
The meeting included some of the biggest names in the billionaires club,
according to the London Times:
The meeting at the home of Sir Paul Nurse,
a British Nobel Prize-winning biochemist and president of Rockefeller
University, was the inspiration of Gates and took place three weeks ago.
The informal afternoon session was so
discreet that some of the billionaires aides were told they were at
security briefings, the Times reported today.
Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of
Philanthropy, speculated that the secrecy surrounding the meeting may have
been due to concern that,
they dont want to be seen as a global
cabal.
According to the Times, the billionaires were
each given 15 minutes to present their favorite cause.
Over dinner they discussed how they might settle
on an umbrella cause that could harness their interests. Taking their cue
from Gates, the report said, they agreed population control was the
No. 1 issue.
In February, Gates, 53, outlined an ambitious plan to cap global population
at 8.3 billion - about one billion fewer than currently projected.
Patricia Stonesifer, former chief executive of the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation, said the billionaires would continue to meet over the next
few months.
A guest at the meeting told the Times population
growth would be addressed as a potentially disastrous environmental, social
and industrial threat.
This is something so nightmarish that
everyone in this group agreed it needs big-brain answers, said the
guest. They need to be independent of government agencies, which are
unable to head off the disaster we all see looming.
As to secrecy, the guest said,
They wanted to speak rich to rich without
worrying anything they said would end up in the newspapers, painting
them as an alternative world government.
