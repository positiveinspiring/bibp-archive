# Greek Vote Pushes EU to Limit

The
resounding victory of Alexis Tsipras in the Greek election was
certainly a referendum that rejected the austerity demands
placed on Greece by the European Union.
The Wall Street Journal
says the following, in
'Syriza Win in Greek Election Sets Up New Europe Clash.'
"A Syriza
victory marks an astonishing upset of Europe's political order,
which decades ago settled into an orthodox centrism while many
in Syriza describe themselves as Marxists.
It emboldens the
challenges of other radical parties, from the right-wing
National Front in France to the newly formed left-wing Podemos
party in Spain, and it sets Greece on a collision course with
Germany and its other Eurozone rescuers."
What informed
political onlooker did not see this coming?
The EU acts as if it
was a Holy Roman Empire using some very unholy demands and
requirements. Since Greece has a laid back culture, the notion
that imposing a rigorous German work ethic on the Mediterranean
city-states is about as shortsighted as allowing a popular vote
in the cradle of Democracy.
If the EU wants to be the seat of
the Banksters New World Order, rectifying this
oversight needs to be part of any additional rollovers of the
debt.
The NYT
reports on the German reaction to this election, in
'Greece Chooses Anti-Austerity Party in Major Shift.'
"While Greece
sees itself as being punished by creditors' demands, Germany and
a host of European officials have argued that Greece and other
troubled nations in the Eurozone must clean up the high debts
and deficits at the root of Europe's crisis.
They say Athens
has failed to make enough progress on structural reforms seen as
necessary to stabilize the economy, and they are pressing Greece
to raise billions of Euros through more budgetary cutbacks and
taxes."
Sounds like
NATO Panzer tanks may need to surround the Acropolis. At issue
is the next round of payments and exactly how far Tsipras' new
coalition government will push back.
From the
socialist French press,
Greek radical-left leader vows to end 'humiliation and pain',
the precedent dispute provides a look at the agenda that will be
fought over.
"Greece's
bailout deal with the Eurozone is due to end on February 28 and
Tsipras's immediate challenge will be to settle doubts over the
next installment of more than 7 billion Euros in international
aid.
EU finance ministers are due to discuss the issue in
Brussels on Monday.
Tsipras has
promised to renegotiate agreements with the European Commission,
European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund 'troika'
and write off much of Greece's 320-billion-euro debt, which
at more than 175 percent of gross domestic product, is the
world's second highest after Japan."
The
imposed neocolonialism from Brussels technocrats on Greece
after
the 2008 financial 'bubble' is 'A
True Greek Tragedy - Odyssey of the EU,'
concluded that,
"This
tragedy is an existential test. Appreciate the absurdity
of compliance with the New World Order, and apply comic
relief, to those who follow commends of the EU Poseidon
ship of state."
At stake is the ability of the EU to continue their
centralization dictates in the face of public resistance.
The victory of
SYRIZA provides encouragement for similar
movements from Spain, Portugal to Italy. However, such
self-government enthusiasm flies in the face of the
institutional power of the blue-blood aristocracy of
financial elites, who in the past have never hesitated
waging war to suppress independence sentiments.
The term Grexit is introduced to forewarn the
op-out of the EU option.
Further explanation is elaborated
in
'Greece
Lightning - Six things you Need to Know about Syriza's Victory.'
1.
Background - the Greek
economy
2.
Yesterday's election - and why Syriza wants to stay in
the EU
3.
But Germany is more
relaxed about a Grex
4.
It's now a question of how far Germany will budge
5. The Eurozone is (probably) strong enough to
withstand Grexit
6.
But still, Grexit would be a risk that no one actively
wants to take
Hugo Dixon in
Grexit still unlikely after Syriza win takes
another viewpoint.
His outlook is based on the assumption
that "no head of government in the other euro countries
wants Greece to leave", so some kind of accommodation will
be offered to appease the factions that resist their
inordinate debt burden.
"So there might be a way of
cutting a deal. The snag is that doing so would involve
a massive somersault - or what Greeks call a 'kolotoumba'.
Many of Tsipras' backers would then accuse him of betraying
their cause. It is still far from clear whether he is
prepared to do that.
But if the Syriza leader is
not prepared to compromise, Greece will default and will
have to impose capital controls to stop the banks
collapsing. If the people then forced the government to
backtrack, there would be one final chance to stay in
the euro.
Otherwise, the drachma would
beckon."
Oh the
horror of a country leaving the European Union and chucking
the EURO.
The factual consequences of Greece exiting the EU
should not be gauged solely in economic terms. The limits
upon which the
Bilderberg
oligarchy will tolerate liberation dissent become the
decisive price and test of brute power in this battle for
autonomy.
The Greek
version of socialism is surely no model for economic
prosperity. Nonetheless, the systematic fleecing of Greek
assets by the vultures preying on the misery from the 2008
crash has yet to be put back in balance.
The
viability of
EU Bonds Rollover Debt with a Chinese Bailout makes the
case why the EU is vulnerable to the mountains of their own
obligations.
The most likely outcome from the election of
Alexis Tsipras is that a rescheduling rather than a
reduction in the amount of indebtedness will take place. The
EU Rothschild band of thieves knows no forgiveness, when it
comes to collecting on their phony debt created currency
loans.
The brave
Spartans saved civilization at Thermopylae.
It is doubtful
that type of campaign can be fought again by today's Greeks.
