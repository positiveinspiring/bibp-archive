The encirclement of Syria and Lebanon has long
been in the works.
Since 2001, Washington and NATO have started the process
of cordoning off Lebanon and Syria.
The permanent NATO presence in the Eastern
Mediterranean and the Syrian Accountability Act are part of this initiative.
It appears that this roadmap is based on a 1996 Israeli document aimed at
controlling Syria.
The documents name is
A Clean Break - A New Strategy for Securing the Realm.
The 1996 Israeli document, which included prominent U.S. policy figures as
authors, calls for rolling back Syria in 2000 or afterward. The roadmap
outlines pushing the Syrians out of Lebanon, diverting the attention of
Damascus by using an anti-Syrian opposition in Lebanon, and then
destabilizing Syria with the help of both Jordan and Turkey. This has all
respectively occurred from 2005 to 2011.
This is also why the anti-Syrian March 14
Alliance and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) were created in
Lebanon.
As a first step towards all this the 1996 document even calls for the
removal of President Saddam Hussein from power in Baghdad and even alludes
to the balkanization of Iraq and forging a strategic regional alliance
against Damascus that includes a Sunni Muslim Arab Central Iraq. The
sectarian nature of this project is very obvious as are its ties to opposing
a so-called Shiite Crescent.
The roadmap seeks to foment sectarian divisions
as a means of conquering Syria and creating a Shiite-Sunni rift that will
oppose Iran and keep the Arab monarchs in power.
The U.S. has now initiated a naval build-up off the Syrian and Lebanese
coasts. This is part of Washingtons standard scare tactics that it has used
as a form of intimidation and psychological warfare against Iran, Syria, and
the Resistance Bloc.
While Washington is engaged in its naval build-up, the
mainstream media networks controlled by the Saudis and Arab clients of the
U.S. are focusing on the deployment of Russian naval vessels to Syria, which
can be seen as a counter-move to NATO.
Al-Ramtha in Jordan is being used to launch attacks into Daraa and Syrian
territory.
The Jordanian Minister of State for Media Affairs and
Communications, Rakan Al-Majali, has even
publicly admitted this and
dismissed it as weapons smuggling.

Arms Smuggling to
Syria

For years, Jordanian forces have successfully
prevented weapons from reaching the Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank from Jordanian territory.
In reality, Amman is sending weapons
into Syria and working to destabilize Syria. Jordanian forces work as a
frontline to protect Israel and the Jordanian intelligence services are an
extension of the C.I.A. and Mossad.
According to the Turkish media, France has sent its military trainers into
Turkey and Lebanon to prepare conscripts against Syria. The Lebanese media
also suggests the same.
The so-called Free Syrian Army and other
NATO-GCC
front organizations are also using Turkish and Jordanian territory to stage
raids into Syria.
Lebanon is also being used to smuggle weapon
shipments into Syria. Many of these weapons were actually arms that the
Pentagon had secretly re-directed into Lebanon from Anglo-American occupied
Iraq during the
George W. Bush Jr. presidency.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, has promised the Syrian National
Council, that a so-called humanitarian corridor will be imposed on Syria.
Once again, the Syrian National Council is not an independent entity and
therefore Juppé did not really make a promise; he really made a declaration.
While foreign companies like
Suncor Energy were forced to leave Libya, they
have not left Syria. The reason that these companies have stayed has been
presented as being humanitarian, because they provide domestic local
services in Syria. For example, Suncor Energy helped produce oil for export
from Libya, but in Syria produces energy for local consumption.
In reality, hostile governments are letting
these companies stay, because they siphon money out of Syria. They want to
prevent any money from going in, while they want to also drain the local
economy as a catalyst to internal implosion in Syria.
Along with the U.S. and its NATO allies, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
is imposing sanctions that include an end to all flights to Syria. The GCC
states and Turkey have joined the foreign ministries of NATO states in
asking their citizens to leave Syria.
Since the U.N. Security Council is no longer a
viable route against Syria, the GCC may also try to impose a no-fly zone
over Syria through the Arab League.
Turkey - NATOs Trojan
Horse and Gateway into the Middle East
Turkey was present at the Arab League meeting in Morocco, which demanded
regime change in Damascus.
Ankara has been playing a dirty game. Initially,
during the start of NATOs war against Libya, Ankara pretended to be neutral
while it was helping the Transitional Council in Benghazi. The Turkish
government does not care about the Syrian population.
On the contrary, the
demands that Turkish officials have made to the Syrians spell out that realpolitik is at play. In tune with the GCC, Turkey has demanded that
Damascus re-orient its foreign policy and submit to Washingtons demands as
a new satellite.
Through a NATO initiative, the Turks have also
been responsible for recruiting fighters against the Libyan and Syrian
governments.
For several years Ankara has been silently trying to de-link Syria from Iran
and to displace Iranian influence in the Middle East. Turkey has been
working to promote itself and its image amongst the Arabs, but all along it
has been a key component of the plans of Washington and NATO. At the same
time, it has been upgrading its military capabilities in the Black Sea and
on its borders with Iran and Syria.
Its military research and development body,
TUBITAK-SAGE, has also announced that Ankara will also start mass-production
of cruise-missiles in 2012 that will be fitted for its navy and forthcoming
deliveries of U.S. military jets that could be used in future regional wars.
Turkey and NATO have also agreed to upgrade Turkish bases for NATO troops.
In September 2011, Ankara joined Washingtons missile shield project, which
upset both Moscow and Tehran. The Kremlin has reserved the right to attack
NATOs missile shield facilities in Eastern Europe, while Tehran has
reserved the right to attack NATOs missile shield facilities in Turkey or
in the case of a regional war. There have also been discussions about the
Kremlin deploying Iskander missiles to Syria.
Since June 2011, Ankara has been talking about invading Syria. It has
presented the invasion plans as a humanitarian mission to establish a
buffer zone and humanitarian corridor under R2P, while it has also
claimed that the protests in Syria are a regional issue and not a domestic
issue.
In July 2011, despite the close Irano-Turkish
economic ties, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard made it clear that Tehran
would support the Syrians and choose Damascus over Ankara.
In August 2011,
Ankara started deploying retired soldiers and its military reserve units to
the Turkish-Syrian border.
It is in this context, that the Russian military
presence has also been beefing up in the port of Tartus.
From Damascus to
Tehran
It is also no mere coincidence that Senator Joseph Lieberman started
demanding at the start of 2011 that the Pentagon and NATO attack Syria and
Iran. Nor is it a coincidence that Tehran has been included in the recent
Obama Administration sanctions imposed against Damascus.
Damascus is being targeted as a means of
targeting Iran and, in broader terms, weakening Tehran, Moscow, and Beijing
in the struggle for control over the Eurasian landmass.
The U.S. and its
remaining allies are about to reduce their forces in Iraq, but they do not
want to leave the region or allow Iran to create a bridge between itself and
the Eastern Mediterranean using Iraq.
Once the U.S. leaves Iraq, there will be a direct corridor between Lebanon
and Syria with Iran. This will be a nightmare for Washington and Tel Aviv.
It will entrench Iranian regional dominance and cement the Resistance Bloc,
which will pin Iran, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinians together.
Israel and the U.S. will both be struck with major strategic blows.
The pressure on Syria is directly tied to this American withdrawal from Iraq
and Washingtons efforts to block Tehran from making any further
geo-political gains. By removing Damascus from the equation, Washington and
its allies are hoping to create a geo-strategic setback for Iran.
Everything that Washington is doing is in preparation for the new
geo-political reality and an attempt to preserve its regional standing.
U.S.
military forces from Iraq will actually be redeployed to the GCC countries
in the Persian Gulf. Kuwait will host new combat units that have been
designated to re-enter Iraq should security collapse, such as in the case of
a regional war, or to confront Iran and its allies in a future conflict.
The U.S. is now activating the so-called
Coalition of the Moderate that it created under George W. Bush Jr. and
directing it against Iran, Syria, and their regional allies.
On November 23, 2011 the Turks signed a military agreement with Britain to
establish a strategic partnership and closer Anglo-Turkish military ties.
During an important state visit by Abdullah Gül to London, the agreement was
signed by Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond and the Deputy Chief of the
Turkish General Staff, Hulusi Akar.
The Anglo-Turkish agreement comes into play
within the framework of the meetings that the British Chief of Defence
Staff, General David Richards, and
Liam Fox, the former scandal-ridden
British defence minister, had with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv. After the
visit of General Richards to Israel, Ehud Barak would visit Britain and
later Canada for talks concerning Syria and its strategic ally Iran.
Within this timeframe the British and Canadian
governments would declare that they were prepared for war with both Syria
and Iran.
London has announced that military plans were also drawn for war with Syria
and Iran. On the other side of the Atlantic, Canadas Defence Minister,
Peter MacKay, created shockwaves in Canada when he made belligerent
announcements about war with Syria and Iran. He also announced that Canada
was buying a new series of military jets through a major arms purchase.
Days later, both Canada and Britain would also
cut their banking and financial ties with Iran. In reality, these steps have
largely been symbolic, because Tehran was deliberately curbing it ties with
Britain and Canada. For months the Iranians have also openly been evaluating
cutting their ties with Britain and several other E.U. members.
The events surrounding Syria have much more to do with the geo-politics of
the Middle East than just Syria alone.
In the Israeli Knesset, the events in Syria were
naturally tied to reducing Iranian power in the Middle East. Tel Aviv has
been preparing itself for a major conflict for several years. This includes
its long distance military flights to Greece that simulated an attack on
Iran and its deployment of nuclear-armed submarines to the Persian Gulf.
It has also conducted the Turning Point
exercises, which seek to insure the continuation of the Israeli government
through the evacuation and relocation of the Israeli cabinet and officials,
including the Israeli finance ministry, to secret bunkers in the case of a
war.
For half a decade Washington has been directing a military arms build-up in
the Middle East aimed at Iran and the Resistance Bloc.
-
It has sent massive
arms shipments to Saudi Arabia.
-
It has sent deliveries of bunker busters to
the U.A.E. and Israel, amongst others.
-
It has upgraded its own deadly
arsenal.
-
U.S. officials have also started to openly discuss murdering
Iranian leaders and military officials through covert operations.
What the world is facing is a pathway towards
possible military escalation that could go far beyond the boundaries of the
Middle East and suck in Russia, China, and their allies.
The Revolutionary Guard have also made it clear
that if conflict is ignited with Iran that Lebanon, Iraq, and the
Palestinians would all be drawn in as Iranian allies.
