# Despite Global Economy Plummeting into Despair, Mega Banks Boast All-Time 
Record Profits

After seven years of benefiting from
the greatest transfer of wealth in history, the
U.S. banking industry topped it off with record profits in 2015.
The Great Fleecing may have reached its height just as the
scheme known as
Quantitative Easing ran out of gas.
"The U.S. banking industry
earned net income of $163.63 billion in 2015, the highest
net income of any year in the SNL bank regulatory database,
which dates back to 1991
The largest four banks,
-
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA
-
Bank of America NA
-
Wells Fargo Bank NA
-
Citibank NA,
...together earned 42.7% of the
industry's income in 2015."
This bonanza stands in stark
contrast to the plight of the middle class, whose wages have
stagnated while health insurance costs reach crippling
proportions.
Wealth inequality
in the U.S. has greatly
expanded - a trend that defines countries with Quantitative Easing
(QE) programs.
The QE scheme cooked up by
the
Federal Reserve and Wall St. banks is designed to benefit the
wealthiest, as Jon Hartley
pointed out in Forbes last June:
"Kevin Warsh, a former Fed board
member and one of the Brookings panelists, held a different
view explaining that quantitative easing as a policy works
purely through an 'asset price channel' enriching the few
who own stocks or other financial products (and not the 96%
of Americans who receive the majority of their income
through labor).
This mechanism is radically
unlike conventional monetary policy of central bank interest
rate cuts which work through a 'credit channel' benefiting
the country's mortgage borrowers, who make up majority of
the population."
It wasn't enough that the federal
government borrowed trillions off the backs of citizens to bail
out the very banks that caused the Great Recession.
The same
cabal of rich and
powerful - our modern version of royalty - then used that event to
siphon even more wealth from the middle class under a new game
called QE.
Jobs, wages, and the GDP took a back
seat to the "too big to fail" Wall St. banks, because they
couldn't trust the plebes with all that money for fear of
inflation.
As a result, the various schemes
these banks engaged in with the free money - including
mortgage-backed securities, company mergers, company debt
offerings, stock buybacks - did nothing but secure that wealth for
the 1%.
The record profits of the banking
industry in 2015 make it seem almost comical that
Morgan Stanley will pay
$3.2 billion to get out of trouble
for its part in causing the recession.
"In the deal, the investment
bank acknowledges that it misrepresented the risks of
mortgage-backed securities leading up to the 2008 housing
and financial crisis.
Morgan Stanley knew that it was
selling securities backed by residential mortgages with
'material defects' - such as loans that were 'underwater,'
where the loan was larger than the value of the house."
In the U.S., banks can just give the
government money - which it got thanks to Quantitative Easing - to
avoid being treated as a criminal.
In Iceland, they actually jail bankers who helped cause the
recession.
As the QE scheme has run its course,
it appears that
central banks may have lost control, but not before securing
that immense transfer of wealth to the upper echelon...
