U.S. military troops
and bases around the world
It is difficult to pinpoint exactly when it happened, but clear evidence can
be seen at least in the aftermath of World War II.
Some trace the origins back to 1898 and the Spanish-American War, or even
earlier to the War of 1812. And still others would say that imperial
ambitions were even on the minds of some of the Founding Fathers.
Regardless, there can be no doubt that today the
United States of America is
an 'empire'. It is probably safe to assume that most Americans
do not think of their country as an empire.
As a conservative in my younger years, I might
have even labeled the suggestion as anti-American, rationalizing to myself:
Sure, we may have strategic military bases
around the world and we may use force at times, but it is only for
benevolent purposes.
We get the bad guys, give the country back to
the good guys, and we leave. The U.S. does not try to rule the world.
I was wrong...
While it has indeed expanded its borders through conquest in the past, the
modern United States exercises its global hegemony in a different way than
the old colonial empires:
through a worldwide network of military
bases.
This network is so vast that there is probably
not one single individual who knows precisely how many bases exist at any
given time, but even the Pentagon acknowledges that the number is over 600,
and with an honest assessment the total would surely be much higher than
that, possibly over 1,000.
The fact is that America's unique empire is the most expansive in all of
history, covering 6 of 7 continents and nearly 150 countries, and including
what are essentially 10 floating bases (or is it 19?) capable of
establishing a military presence in any ocean on earth.
There are currently about 160,000 U.S. soldiers
officially deployed overseas, along with many more tens of thousands or even
hundreds of thousands of individuals such as spies, technicians and civilian
contractors. This comes at an enormous cost, measurable in many different
ways.
Among these are the cost in blood, the price in
dollars, and the impact on American society.
Blood
Just since WWII, the American Empire has sacrificed the lives of over
100,000 of its soldiers.
The bulk of this number is accounted for in the
Vietnam War and the Korean War, both undeclared and unnecessary wars. The
remainder is mostly made up of deaths in the so-called
War
on Terror in both Afghanistan and Iraq - 6,822 to be exact, but
the War on Terror is perpetual by its own definition and by design, so this
number is most certainly not final.
On top of this number - which is already more
than double the deaths on 9/11 - are many tens of thousands wounded.
The battlefield is not the only place where the blood of soldiers is
spilled. A shocking twenty-two U.S. veterans commit suicide every single
day, with nearly one active duty soldier suicide per day. This means that
there are currently more soldiers taking their own lives than being killed
on the battlefield.
The common diagnosis of this epidemic is the
inadequate treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
However, as the Future of Freedom
Foundation's Jacob Hornberger suggests, the root cause may be
more accurately identified as,
"guilt-massive unresolved guilt over the
wrongful killing of other human beings" in unjust wars like Iraq.
The cost in the blood of innocent civilians has
been astronomically higher than that of soldiers - well into the millions.
The Vietnam War alone saw the deaths of two
million civilians. Throughout the 1990s and following the first war on Iraq
by the
first president Bush,
the U.S. caused the deaths of as many as half a million children with its
crippling sanctions aimed at punishing former U.S. ally Saddam Hussein, a
price that the Clinton administration said was "worth it" (not just once,
but twice).
In 2003, the
second president Bush
again invaded Iraq, and for reasons that were demonstrated to be lies.
There were over 133,000 individually recorded
civilian deaths due to direct violence, but this number is known to be very
low. It is estimated that the total count of Iraqi deaths, both civilians
and fighters, due to the U.S. invasion could be over 650,000 and possibly
even over a million.
Over 11 years later, people continue to die
daily as a result of the violence that consumes the country.
In addition, between 1.5 and 4.5 million people
have been displaced from their homes, surely never to return. Further,
post-war Iraq has been plagued with a dramatic increase in cancer and birth
defects - likely the result of the U.S. military's use of depleted uranium
and white phosphorus.
In Afghanistan, the number of children dying from unexploded ordnance left
behind by the U.S. military is rising.
American forces have removed munitions from only
3 percent of the,
"800 square miles of land littered with
undetonated grenades, rockets and mortar shells".
Although military officials say they intend to
clean up the munitions left behind, other former U.S. warzones remain deadly
to this day, including Vietnam where bombs continue to kill civilians over
40 years after the last American soldier left the country.
The latest trend of U.S. Empire-imposed death on foreigners (as well as four
American citizens) is through drone strikes.
President
Obama
has heavily increased the use of drones throughout the world, and
there has been much evidence showing a high rate of civilian deaths. In an
effort to distort the numbers of civilian drone victims, Obama has redefined
the word "militant" to mean any military-aged male killed within a blast
radius.
In other words, he has redefined "civilian" to
not include any male above the age of 18 regardless of whether he is
actually a civilian.
The Obama administration has even routinely and
intentionally targeted first responders to the scene of drone attacks in
"double tap" strikes (which the U.S. considers "terrorism" if done by
others), in addition to striking multiple wedding parties in what it claims
were mistakes.
Treasure
The official budget for the Department of Defense is about $500 billion.
However, this does not give an accurate picture
of what the U.S. actually spends on militarism. The official figures exclude
significant expenditures that are spread throughout the Federal government.
For 2015, this includes,
-
$157 billion in
veterans' benefits
-
$83 billion in non-veteran military benefits
-
$19
billion to maintain the U.S. nuclear arsenal (categorized under the
Department of Energy)
-
$41 billion for the Department of Homeland
Security
The official numbers also exclude the interest on the national
debt from past military spending, which is conservatively estimated to be
over $185 billion annually, and some estimate to be up to $364 billion for
fiscal year 2015.
When taking into account these and other
non-Department of Defense expenditures, the annual cost of the Empire easily
tops $1 trillion.
To understand how expensive the U.S. Empire's wars are, consider the recent
War
on Iraq. The cost to date is over $1.7 trillion with an
additional $490 billion in veteran benefits that must be paid. That price
tag is jaw dropping as it is, particularly in light of the Bush
administrations absurdly low predictions in the $50 billion to $60 billion
range.
But the true costs when accounting for interest
over the next four decades could be a staggering $6 trillion.
In addition to the direct costs, there is enormous opportunity cost as a
result of the massive government expenditure on militarism. This cost is
incalculable, since it is impossible to know the productive uses to which
capital may have been put had it not been squandered by the government and
diverted to destructive purposes.
But it is reasonable to expect that regardless
of where the money went, it would have been more productive than building
weapons to blow up people and property in aggressive wars of choice.
Soul
Perhaps the most insidious effect of imperialism is that which it has on the
society that lives under it.
The family is subordinated to the State as
soldiers leave their loved ones behind to go fight in wars ostensibly to
defend freedom and keep Americans safe, but which in reality have little to
do with these reasons and are instead primarily about fighting for the
interests of the Empire.
Fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, sons and
daughters are killed, maimed and psychologically scarred for life. Thousands
of orphans and widows are created, and the impact is felt throughout
generations.
Sporting events and other recreational activities prominently feature the
military and have become celebrations of war, many of them complete with
soldiers in uniform marching with guns and fighter jets flying overhead.
Many Americans have been convinced that it is necessary for the U.S. to
maintain a prison camp in Cuba (of all places!) where inmates are held
indefinitely without trial in abhorrent conditions and even in spite of many
having long been cleared for release.
Actions that would have been abominable to most
people in any other circumstance - such as torture - are gradually accepted.
Even many churches are overcome with nationalism
and abandon their religious teachings of peace.
"Support the troops" becomes the highest
virtue, supplanting The Golden Rule and "blessed are the
peacemakers".
Constant imperial aggression seems to have a
conditioning effect on a society.
People who live under empire grow to accept
similar treatment as those on the receiving end of their government's
foreign violence.
Mark Twain identified this phenomenon
when he predicted in 1909 the eventual results of imperialism following the
U.S. conquest of the Philippines:
Lust of conquest had long ago done its work;
trampling upon the helpless abroad had taught her, by a natural process,
to endure with apathy the like at home; multitudes who had applauded the
crushing of other people's liberties, lived to suffer for their mistake
in their own persons.
This sentiment is put even more succinctly by
the inimitable Scott Horton who paraphrases the late American author
and professor Chalmers Johnson by saying:
"You either give up your empire or you live
under it."
Evidence of the truth of these statements can be
seen in the way Americans are treated domestically by government forces.
The U.S. has the largest prison population in
the world, with half of inmates imprisoned for drug offenses. There are over
100 SWAT team raids per day in this country, many of them no-knock raids
conducted in the middle of the night with disastrous consequences to totally
innocent victims.
In
post-9/11 America, it has become commonly accepted that one must
submit to either a full body scan or an intrusive pat down at the hands of a
government employee before boarding an airplane. Americans live under the
largest surveillance apparatus in world history.
The NSA collects billions of phone calls,
emails and cell phone location records every month without a warrant or even
probable cause. The notion of being secure in one's person and property from
government intrusion is virtually a thing of the past.
Ultimately, the justifications given for a global U.S. military presence are
false.
As a result of the Empire, Americans are
less free, and they are also less safe due to the
hatred that their government's actions throughout the world engender.
Americans are immeasurably poorer as a result of massive government spending
and debt.
And as subjects of the U.S. Empire, many
Americans sacrifice a part of their humanity and even begin to view people
outside of their country the same way their government does, and are
gradually finding themselves treated similarly at home as well.
The price of the Empire - in blood, treasure and
soul - is simply too high to tolerate.
