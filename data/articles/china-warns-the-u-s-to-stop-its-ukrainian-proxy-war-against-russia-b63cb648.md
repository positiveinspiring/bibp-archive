A much-ignored huge news report from Reuters on Friday, February 27th, was headlined,
"Chinese diplomat tells West to consider Russia's security concerns over Ukraine."
China's Ambassador to Belgium (which has the capital of the EU) said that the "nature and root cause" of the Ukrainian conflict is "the West," and that,
"The West should abandon the zero-sum mentality, and take the real security concerns of Russia into consideration."
By "real security concerns," he is clearly referring to NATO's expansion right up to Russia's border, and America's surrounding Russia with U.S. military bases, now increasingly including the most strategic of Russia's bordering countries: Ukraine. In other words, this diplomat says:
"the West" has a "zero-sum" attitude toward Russia, instead of seeking to move forward with an approach in which neither side among the nuclear superpowers benefits at the other's expense - the entire world moves forward together.
This is a direct criticism of Barack Obama, and of all of the pro-Obama, anti-Putin, EU leaders. It's also an implicit repudiation of Obama's having repeatedly referred to the U.S. as "the one indispensable nation." (Another example of that phrase is here.)
Obama keeps saying:
every other nation, except the U.S., is "dispensable."
He clearly thinks that Russia is. That's not merely an insult: it's an act of provocation; it is virtually asking for a fight. And all for what? For whose nuclear char? This criticism of the aggressive nationalist Obama does not come from China's top leadership, but it would not have come at all if they had not approved of it in advance. China thus now tells Obama: Stop it. Stop it in word, and in deed. Implicitly, China is also telling Obama:
hina is not dispensable, either.
In fact, the entire mentality, which Obama embodies, is not just callous and insulting; it's dangerous. Like President G.W. Bush, Obama is increasingly an embarrassment to his country. Shortly before Obama's coup in Ukraine, Gallup International issued, on 30 December 2013, a poll of 65 countries, which found that:
"The US was the overwhelming choice (24% of respondents) for the country that represents the greatest threat to peace in the world today. This was followed by Pakistan (8%), China (6%), North Korea, Israel and Iran (5%). Respondents in Russia (54%), China (49%) and Bosnia (49%) were the most fearful of the US as a threat."
"The US was the overwhelming choice (24% of respondents) for the country that represents the greatest threat to peace in the world today.

More details of that poll were reported here. When the U.S. Government is hankering for a war with the only other nuclear superpower, such findings certainly make sense. And the 54% of Russians who cited the U.S. as the greatest threat to peace would probably be far higher today.
But Gallup International didn't publish any update on that poll-question, perhaps because the original financial backer (which was unnamed) wouldn't fund it. Already, the finding was bad enough. But Obama keeps calling the U.S. "the one indispensable nation in the world." He keeps telling other nations: you are dispensable. He keeps rubbing it in - not the fact, but his own nationalism. It reminds some people of Mussolini, and of Hitler.
But Obama pretends to be a democrat, not a fascist. Maybe he's just a bigger liar than they were. Maybe that's what he is so arrogant about: his terrific ability to deceive.
After all, he won the 2009 Nobel 'Peace' Prize for it:
for lying. For misrepresenting himself as being progressive, instead of regressive.
Well, now: anyone who doesn't know the reality is deluded by propaganda - and it's not coming from Russia, nor from China. It's coming from their own nation's 'news' media. Which heads-of-state want to be publicly associated with a foreign leader like that, one who tells the given leader's public:
your nation is dispensable.
Fools. Only fools... Obama is encouraging other countries to oppose the United States. Wow... He's the black George W. Bush...
Return to Russia and The EU
Return to American "Empire"
Return to Obama - A "New" Sociopolitical Era or The Greatest Deception?
