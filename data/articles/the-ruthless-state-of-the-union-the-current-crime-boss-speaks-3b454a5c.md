-
Are we all working together to surrender
our guns in exchange for movie tickets and candy?
-
Are we pretending to be overjoyed that
the federal government wants to force everyone to
get vaccinated and
eat GMO food, and take
SSRI antidepressants that
demonstrably cause people to go crazy and kill others? Is that it?
-
Are we somehow working together to print
endless amounts of money?
-
Are we working together to push the
percentage of Americans collecting free government money from 40
percent to 60 percent? Is that the glorious goal?
-
Are we working together to give money to
alternative-energy companies so they can go broke and declare
bankruptcy?
-
Are we working together to protect and
defend the World Trade Organization, so ravenous mega-corporations
can export jobs to China and roam the global landscape, raping and
pillaging resources and labor?
-
Are we working together to accept
Obamacare, which will steadily eliminate natural-health alternatives
and enroll more people in
a medical system that kills 225,000
people (actually a lot more) every year like clockwork? Is that the
goal?
-
Are we working together to pretend we
have two very different major political parties in the country,
instead of one party with two heads?
-
Are we working to assure that no
bankster is ever sent to prison
for scamming the American people out of
trillions of dollars?
-
Are we working together to take guns
away from people who would only use them to defend themselves and
their families against criminals, while at the same we work to
ignore gang violence stemming in part from the fact that Mexican
drug cartels use these gangs as subcontractors, under the protection
of the federal government?
-
Are we working together to imagine that
our troops are really
fighting wars to protect and
defend the nation?
-
Are we working together to hide the fact
that, although interest rates are artificially low, were spending
more and more money every month to buy what we need to survive?
-
Are we working together to hamstring
every small business in America with red tape and taxes?
-
Are we working together to ignore the
absurd insanity called
climate-change 'science,'
so the government can install carbon taxes and penalties and lop the
top off of American industry?
-
Are we all working together to frame
attractive free incentive packages for unlimited numbers of
immigrants who come to America, while untold numbers of Americans
are going hungry every night, and people cant find jobs anywhere?
Is that the objective?
-
Destabilization of society, under the
cynical guise of humane gift-giving?
-
Are we working to dream that when the
president says hes going to focus on jobs in his second term, this
means hes actually going to do more than squint at the sun?
-
Are we working to find more foreign
enemies we can invade, as our military advance teams pave the
way for imperial corporations and continue to launch some sort of
ridiculous surround Russia operation?
-
Are we all working together to drown the
Third World in free medical drugs and
vaccines that destroy immune systems,
rather than cleaning up contaminated water supplies and installing
simple sanitation systems (at a millionth of the cost of the drugs)?
-
Are we all working together just to
work together and continue the fine tradition of destroying the
nation from the inside?
