Storyline
The disastrous impact of the 2008 financial crisis still lingers
today.
What lessons have
been learned and which steps are being taken to prevent future
economic catastrophe?
The informative new
documentary In Search of the Bankers' Brain investigates the
continuing effect of the crisis on London's economy, and
profiles the mysterious bankers who have yet to rectify their
corruptive ways.
The content of the film stems from the work of Joris
Luyendijk, a journalist for The Guardian whose far-reaching
blog focuses on matters related to finance and banking.
"We know more
about ancient Egypt than about the people who currently
shape our lives," he observes.
Luyendijk's efforts
seek to unmask the,
...who
can make or break a nation's economy.
The film also features interviews with former players of the
financial game who have now embraced their status as industry
whistleblowers.
They all testify to a
system that's sick with unregulated greed and rewards the truly
ruthless with unimaginable wealth. We learn how they manage to
operate in relative anonymity, and the tricks and triggers they
employ to excel in their line of work.
The film's central thesis, however, regards the chemistry of
greed.
A psychologist chimes
in to share insights on the effects of greed on the brain, and
explains the cerebral characteristics that define many of the
most successful masters of banking and investments.
It's not a flattering
portrayal; in fact, the film pulls no punches by labeling these
subjects
as psychopaths.
They possess a level of deviance and
superficiality that makes them ideally suited for victory in
today's excessive and permissive financial climate.
If they should incur
defeat, many will resort to suicide...
Many documentaries have tackled the subject of the financial
crisis over the years. In Search of the Bankers' Brain is a work
of distinction because it approaches the topic from an entirely
unique perspective.
By exploring the
neurological components of those who rise to the top of the
financial sector through questionable practices, we can better
understand the corrosive culture that empowers them every step
along the way.
