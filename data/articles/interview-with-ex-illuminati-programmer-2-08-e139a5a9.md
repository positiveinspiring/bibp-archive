Q: The way you describe
the Illuminati it sounds like the
Third
Reich Revival. I can certainly see the Nazi traits in their behavior
and goals. It seems like Germany is taking the lead, yet again, in
uniting the EU, we see the setting up of a European Army, the Rapid
Reaction Force, and a World Court. How is this ultimately going to
play out?
A: Actually, they have a name for the
New World Order. One of the
synonyms used is the "Fourth Reich". I'm serious.
Lots of
Illuminists have Fourth Reich programming inside. Yep, Germany, and
the EU, will dominate the world economy. The US economy will go down
for awhile, then restore with the help of Europe.
Q: The Book of Revelation pretty much paints a gloomy picture of how
this is going to end, and by what means. How is this going to effect
the Illuminati agenda? They would certainly know about the
prophecies of old and their own foretold demise. Are they attempting
to use prophecies, somehow, to their advantage by way of deceiving
human beings?
A: Basically, they are in denial. They believe that history can be
changed, and that John's prophetic revelation is only one
interpretation of the future. They are aware of Revelations, but
don't take it too seriously.
Remember, some of those at the top are ALREADY in power,
figuratively speaking. They dominate the financial picture, have
immense wealth, several mansions around the world, anything they
want, and the (to them) joy of controlling millions of others. They
believe their intellect is sharp, and that they will be the "good
guys" in the New Order. They are Luciferians, and so believe the
Bible is misguided in its assertions.
For all intents and purposes, if you asked them, they would probably
laugh and say, "But the new order is already here. It just isn't
open yet."
They have been in power for several hundred years, with no
lightening bolts from heaven striking them dead. They may even
believe that they represent God's will on earth (remember, they
serve "God", too, just not the same as the Biblical Christian one).
They would ask back, "how did God allow people to develop such
potential if He didn't want us to help them use it? Isn't it a
criminal waste of the intellect and the gifts he gave us to NOT
develop them, and help people mature into a better race?' They would
argue along these lines.
They believe that basically, they are GOOD and doing a good work,
even if the means are tough to endure at the time. They are weeding
out the weak and unfit, and developing a supreme human being. I know
it sounds like hog wash, but they truly, honestly believe this at a
core level. To be under the judgments in Revelations, they would
have to see themselves as evil, and they don't.
I hope this helps explain a little. I think they would see
themselves in that picture as riding in on the white horses, not the
dark ones. Such is the power of deception. I am a Christian, myself,
and have given up these old beliefs that I was taught in the cult.
