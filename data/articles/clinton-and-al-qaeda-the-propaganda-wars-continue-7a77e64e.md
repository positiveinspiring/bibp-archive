Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton says that the US government is
engaged
in propaganda wars with their own operatives - al-Qaeda.
Clinton sat with Admiral Bill McRaven, head of US Special Operations
Command, at a conference that featured more than 100 US and international
special operations commanders.
On Yemeni tribal websites, the US government seeks to replace anti-American
adverts. Apparently al-Qaeda has been bragging about their impact on Yemen.
While al-Qaeda posted pictures of the US flag draped over coffins, the US
government spread photographs of Yemini civilians in coffins on the same
website.
Our team plastered the same sites with
altered versions of the ads that showed the toll al-Qaida attacks have
taken on the Yemeni people, Clinton said. Extremists are publicly
venting their frustration and asking supporters not to believe
everything they read on the Internet.
The Center for Strategic Counterterrorism
Communications (CSCC), an interagency group comprised of specialist,
diplomats, special operators and intelligence analysts, located within the
State Department are conducting the counter cyber maneuvers, according to
Clinton.
CSCC patrols the internet, focusing on social media, looking for al-Qaeda
operatives, as well as surveying digital communications between social media
users.
Clinton explains that the CSCC is working to find what they refer to as
extremist propaganda. It is easier to patrol the internet, rather than
hack into sites covertly. The CSCC engage users openly on forums.
Anonymity is essential to the work of the CSCC.
Yemen is considered a beta test for international diplomats to see if they
can interject international agendas onto their fledgling government.
Current President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has been the focus of violent
focus between al-Qaeda and the Yemeni government. Unfortunately, the Yemeni
people have been caught in this pre-meditated effort to destabilize their
country.
President Obama recently released a new executive order (EO) called
Blocking
Property of Persons Threatening the Peace, Security, or Stability of Yemen.
In this EO, Obama claims the right to confiscate,
all property and interests in property that
are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States,
or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any
United States person, including any foreign branch, of the following
persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported,
withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary
of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State.
If any person, including US citizens, is accused
of assisting a terrorist group of threatening Yemens peace, security, and
stability they will find their possessions and bank accounts confiscated by
the US government; as well as being arrested and detained by federal
agencies.
In conjunction with this EO, are the
premeditated terrorist attacks on Yemen
by al-Qaeda.
Seems appropriate since al-Qaeda is the US governments go-to
terrorist group; created and funded by our own federal agencies to
destabilize foreign governments.
Al-Qaeda is a CIA creation
Clinton herself admitted that al-Qaeda is a creation of the US government:
Obama, claiming we live in a post al-Qaeda era, explained to the
American people that:
Now that we have killed most of al-Qaeda,
now that people have come to see legitimate means of expression, people
who once might have gone into al-Qaeda see an opportunity for a
legitimate Islamism.
How can this be when Obama is now claiming
al-Qaeda is terrorizing Yemen?
Propaganda runs rampant within our US government. The targets are not just
foreign audiences, but also extensive efforts are made to
control the
average Americans perception of our government.
Four billion dollars per year is spent by the Pentagon on propaganda aimed
at the American public; as well as $202 million spent by the Department of
Defense on misinformation operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2011.
The Pentagon is using sock puppet (fake handles) on social media sites to
purvey false information, harass users and enact psy-ops to influence
Americans.
Sophisticated software allows military to engage in online conversations
with coordinated answers, blog comments and instant messaging remarks that
are solely meant to spread pro-American propaganda.
US Army whistleblower, Lieutenant Col. Daniel Davis believes there is
a definitive aspiration within the US government,
to enable Public Affairs officers to
influence American public opinion when they deem it necessary to
'protect a key friendly center of gravity, to wit US national will'.
The Pentagon and Department of Defense admit to
using fake handles on social media sites to spread US government sanctioned
propaganda.
It makes no sense that the US government would be fighting itself over
control over perception.
Yet, it does appear that within factions of the US government (meant to
appear as separate) special psy-ops are being used against the Yemeni people
(through CIA operatives called al-Qaeda) and carefully controlled propaganda
disseminated across the internet by federal agencies.
The Obama administration is playing both sides of the coin to ensure the
outcome they want.
