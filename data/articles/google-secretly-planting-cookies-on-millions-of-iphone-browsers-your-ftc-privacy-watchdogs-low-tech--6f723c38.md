How a Lone Grad Student Scooped the Government
and What It Means for Your Online Privacy
Jonathan Mayer had a hunch.
The young computer scientist suspected that online advertisers might be
following consumers around the web - even when they set their browsers to
block the snippets of tracking code called cookies.
If Mayers instinct was right, advertisers were
eying people as they moved from one website to another even though their
browsers were configured to prevent this sort of digital shadowing. Working
long hours at his office,
Mayer ran a series of clever tests in which
he purchased ads that acted as sniffers for the sort of unauthorized cookies
he was looking for.
He hit the jackpot, unearthing one of the
biggest privacy scandals of the past year:
Google was secretly planting cookies on
a vast number of iPhone browsers. Mayer thinks millions of iPhones were
targeted by Google.
The feds are often the last to know about
digital invasions of your privacy.
This is precisely the type of privacy violation the Federal Trade Commission
aims to protect consumers from, and Google, which claims the cookies were
not planted in an unethical way, now reportedly
faces a fine of more than $10 million.
But the FTC didnt discover the violation. Mayer
is a 25-year-old grad student working on law and computer science degrees at
Stanford University. He shoehorned his sleuthing between classes and
homework, working from an office he shares in the Gates Computer Science
Building with students from New Zealand and Hong Kong. He doesnt get paid
for his work and he doesnt get much rest.
If it seems odd that a federal regulator was scooped by a sleep-deprived
student, get used to it, because the federal government is often the last to
know about digital invasions of your privacy. The largest privacy scandal of
the past year, also involving Google, wasnt discovered by federal
regulators, either.
A privacy official in Germany forced Google to
hand over the hard drives of cars equipped with 360-degree digital cameras
that were taking pictures for its Street View program.
The Germans discovered that Google wasnt
just shooting photos: The cars downloaded a panoply of sensitive data,
including emails and passwords,
from open Wi-Fi networks.
Google had secretly done the same in the United
States, but the FTC, as well as the Federal Communications Commission, which
oversees broadcast issues, had no idea until the Germans figured it out.
Nearly every day, and often several times a day, there is fresh news of
privacy invasions as companies hone their ability to imperceptibly assemble
a vast amount of data about anyone with a smartphone, laptop or credit card.
Retailers, search engines, social media sites, news organizations - all want
to know as much as they can about their visitors and users so that ads can
be targeted as precisely as possible.
But data mining, which has become central to the
corporate bottom line, can be downright creepy, with companies knowing what
you search for, what you buy, which websites you visit, how long you browse
- and more. Earlier this year, it was revealed that Target realized a
teenage customer was pregnant before her
father knew; the firm identifies first-term pregnancies through, among other
things, purchases of scent-free products.
Its akin to someone rifling through your
wallet, closet or medicine cabinet, but in the digital sphere no one picks
your pocket or breaks into your house. The tracking is done mostly without
your knowledge and, in many cases, despite your attempts to stop it, as
Mayer discovered.
The FTC is the lead agency in the
governments effort to ensure that companies do not cross the still-hazy
border between acceptable and unacceptable data collection.
But the agencys ambitions are
clipped by a lack of both funding and legal authority,
reflecting a broader uncertainty about the role government should play in
what is arguably Americas most promising new industry.
Companies like
Facebook and
Google are global brands for which data mining is at the core of
present and future profits. How far should they go? Current laws provide few
limits, mainly banning data collection from children under 13 and
prohibiting the sale of personal medical data. Beyond that, its a digital
mosh pit, and its likely to remain that way because more regulation tends
to be regarded by politicians in both parties as meaning fewer jobs.
Students will probably continue to beat the FTC
to the punch: The agency has just one privacy technologist working in its
Division of Privacy and Identity Protection and one in the Division of
Financial Practices.
I dont think its controversial to note
that they seem to be understaffed, Mayer said in a phone interview
between classes. I think thats pretty clear.
This isnt the usual sort of story about
regulation watered down by intimate ties between government officials and
the industry they oversee.
Unlike the U.S. Minerals Management Service,
where not long ago a number of officials were found to have shared drugs and
had sex with representatives of the oil and gas industry, key FTC officials
hired by the Obama administration are privacy hawks who worked previously
for consumer-rights groups like Public Citizen and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.
Under Chairman Jon Liebowitz, a Democrat
appointed to the FTC in 2004 and tapped as chairman by President Obama in
2009, the FTC has pushed boundaries; its first privacy technologist, hired
shortly after Liebowitz became chairman, was a semifamous activist who made
a name for himself by printing fake boarding passes to draw attention to
airline security lapses (the FBI, which raided his house, was not pleased).
The agency is working with the tech industry to
create and voluntarily adopt a Do Not Track option, so that consumers can
avoid some intrusive web tracking by advertising firms. And it
issued a report this year that called for
new legislation to define what data miners can and cannot do.
Yet the FTC is ill-equipped to find out, on its own, what companies like
Google and Facebook are doing behind the scenes. For instance, ProPublica
discovered that the FTCs Privacy and Identity Protection technologist has a
digital hand tied behind his back because the computer in his office has
security filters that restrict access to key websites.
While Mayer has an ultrafast internet
connection, top-of-the-line computer, an office chair he loves and tasty
lunches for free (Stanford students do not want in any way, he notes), the
FTC technologist uses his personal laptop and, because there is no Wi-Fi at
the agency, connects to the internet by tethering it to his iPhone.
He browses the web at cellphone speed. There are
no free lunches.

The FTC is headquartered in a landmarked
building on Pennsylvania Avenue flanked by two sculptures of a man trying to
restrain a muscle-bound horse that is straining to gallop away.
The sculptures, completed in 1942, are entitled
Man Controlling Trade, and they explain a lot about the FTCs current
dilemma. The notion of controlling trade, popular when the sculptures were
erected a half-century ago, is not a vote-winner today.
The FTC was an early battleground of the
movement that began in the Reagan era to reduce government regulation. The
agency had more than 1,700 employees in the 1970s, but is down to 1,176
today, even though the economy has more than doubled in that span. The FTCs
responsibilities are quite vast: It must police everything from financial
scams to antitrust activity, identity theft and misleading advertising.
Especially among Republicans, there is little interest in providing more
resources.
California Rep. Mary Bono-Mack, at a
recent hearing on privacy legislation, warned that the government,
has this really bad habit of overreaching
whenever it comes to new regulations.
Although the American Civil Liberties Union may
see an epidemic of privacy violations, Bono-Mack said,
I havent gotten a single letter from
anyone back home urging me to pass a privacy bill.
The skepticism is not just an
outside-the-building phenomenon; it comes from within the FTC, too.
One of the agencys five commissioners,
Republican Thomas Rosch, dissented from its 2013 budget request, which asks
for less money than the prior year budget of $312 million.
Rosch said he believed the FTC still wanted too
much.
In these austere times we should do more
with fewer resources, his dissent said.
The cold shoulder is not entirely Republican.
Earlier this year the Obama administration
unveiled a Privacy
Bill of Rights that sets
a variety of enviable standards for
consumer privacy.
American consumers cant wait any longer
for clear rules of the road that ensure their personal information is
safe online, President Obama said.
The document, which among other things would
allow individuals to control the data collected on them, was welcomed by
consumer groups.
But its not legislation. Its a wish-list. The
administration hopes that some of its wishes, like a Do Not Track option,
will be granted through voluntary industry standards. But many of the wishes
require Congress to pass laws that it is unlikely to pass anytime soon. The
FTCs meager budget request would seem to be the best indication yet of the
prospects for significantly greater federal privacy protection.
Its an old story with a new twist. Few industries have as many admirers in
Washington, D.C., as Silicon Valley, which unlike the oil industry has what
appears to be an equally large number of friends on both sides of the aisle.
The tech industry is generally regarded as liberal-leaning - for instance,
Eric Schmidt, the Google chairman, was an Obama campaign adviser and serves
on the presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.
But Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, was counseled
in his presidential bid by both Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of
Hewlett-Packard, and by Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay who now heads
HP. Silicon Valley is one of the countrys few global growth industries;
politicians are reluctant to put restrictions on what it can and cannot do.
The FTC tries to do the best with what it has. In 2009, with new Obama-era
appointees aboard,
it hired Christopher Soghoian, a
privacy technologist who could perform the sort of sophisticated forensics
that Mayer conducted on Google.
A year later, in 2010, the FTC hired its first
chief technologist, Edward Felten, a Princeton computer scientist who
is highly regarded in tech policy circles.
But the three men who have filled the privacy
technologist job that Soghoian filled first (each have served for about a
year) faced an awkward problem: The desktop in their office is digitally
shackled by security filters that make it impossible to freely browse the
Web.
Crucial websites are off-limits, due to concerns
of computer viruses infecting the FTCs network, and there are severe
restrictions on software downloads. When Soghoian tried to download a
Wi-Fi-sniffing app, his boss told him within a few minutes that he had
tripped a security alarm; he could not use the app on his computer. It had
to be deleted immediately.
To defend against hackers, filtered computers are standard in the
government, but they are problematic for officials who are trying to
discover dishonest activity on the Web; its a bit like telling a cop he
cant patrol in high-crime neighborhoods.
A handful of unfiltered computers are available
in restricted labs at the FTCs headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue and its
satellite offices on New Jersey Avenue and M Street, but this is an ungainly
setup. Rather than leaving their office, waiting for an elevator, swiping
their ID badges across a sensor at the labs locked door and logging into a
computer soaked with malware (because lab PCs are used to test suspicious
applications), the technologists have instead stayed in their office and
tethered their personal laptops to their personal cellphones.
Soghoian and the current privacy technologist, Michael Brennan, tried to get
an unfiltered desktop installed in their office.
Each time - Soghoian in 2010, Brennan in 2011 -
they got tantalizingly close, with new machines delivered to them. But the
computers were never connected to the internet.
Someone at the agency - they dont know who -
got cold feet.
I basically had a $2,000 computer doing
nothing, Soghoian said.
Only one FTC official has an unfiltered desktop:
Felten, the chief technologist.
He is the sort of unconventional public servant
the FTC has hired in recent years. He was an expert witness in the landmark
antitrust suit against Microsoft, a board member of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, and in April he participated in a privacy hackathon with his
teenage daughter. Felten, hired mainly to provide policy advice to the FTC
chairman, also conducts investigations of suspicious websites or apps - this
is what he uses the unshackled computer for.
During an interview, he pointed to it, a bit
like a museum guide gesturing toward a priceless artwork, and said,
This is rare. I think this is the only
one.
We could for sure do more if we had more people, he said while sitting
in his office, which is nearly bare, with a few FTC posters on the
walls, a small table and chairs, and a large desk for his two computers.
There are a lot of opportunities that we
have to let go by because we dont have the people to seize them
opportunities to measure and evaluate whats happening every day in
peoples computers and phones.
Felten, who plans to resume full-time teaching
at Princeton in the fall, was asked whether he has better technological
resources there.
Oh yes, he replied. Thats certainly the
case.

The mismatch between FTC aspirations and
abilities is exemplified by its Mobile Technology Unit, created earlier this
year to oversee the exploding mobile phone sector.
The six-person unit consists of a paralegal, a
program specialist, two attorneys, a technologist and its director,
Patricia Poss.
For the FTC, the unit represents an important
allocation of resources to protect the privacy rights of more than 100
million smartphone owners in America. For Silicon Valley, a six-person team
is barely a garage startup.
Earlier this year, the unit issued
a highly publicized report on mobile apps
for kids; its conclusion was reflected in the subtitle, Current Privacy
Disclosures Are Disappointing.
It was a thin report, however. Rather than
actually checking the personal data accessed by the reports sampling of 400
apps, the report just looked at whether the apps disclose, on the sites
where they are sold, the types of personal data that would be accessed and
what the data would be used for. The body of the report is just 17 pages.
The FTC says it will do deeper research in
future reports.
The mobile unit has an equipment problem, too. Like most government
agencies, the FTC issues Blackberries to key officials.
Poss, the units director, has one. The
Blackberry dominated when Al Gore ran for president, but today its barely
an also-ran with just 12 percent of the smartphone market. Thats not a
problem if you only use your Blackberry for texts, emails and calls.
But its a problem if, like Poss, your job is to
keep track of whats happening in the smartphone market. Most consumers use
Androids or iPhones, and most of the apps written for them are not available
on the Blackberry.
If Poss wants to learn whats going on in the 88 percent of the smartphone
market that her Blackberry cannot access, she would need to leave her office
and go to one of the FTC labs, where she can use or check out an iPhone or
Android. Its a clunky setup, so she resorts to a familiar workaround: She
uses her personal smartphones.
She has an iPhone as well as an Android.
A moment after she mentioned this in an interview, she added,
I probably shouldnt be saying that.
FTC officials are reluctant to talk about their
lack of funding, partly because public whining, especially during hard
economic times, is infrequently rewarded.
Its also politically unwise. A vocal portion of
the electorate believes the government and its regulatory arms have too much
money and power as it is. Additionally, the FTC is trying to keep the tech
industry honest by hinting that the feds are watching everything. It does
not help if Silicon Valley realizes the FTC possesses just a handful of
iPhones and Androids that are kept under lock and key in the basement.
The interview with Poss was conducted in an office on the third floor of the
FTCs headquarters, with an FTC spokeswoman on hand. When Poss was asked
whether it wouldnt make sense for the director of the Mobile Technology
Unit to have a government-issued iPhone or Android, the spokeswoman,
Claudia Farrell, interceded.
Hes trying to get you to bitch, Patti.
Dont do it.
Poss, a lawyer who has worked at the FTC for
more than 12 years, began to look uncomfortable, as though she was in the
witness box, unsure what she was supposed to say.
She made amends by noting she can use her office
computer to look at the smartphone app descriptions posted on the websites
where they are sold.
Then she reversed herself.
Actually, you cant, Poss said. We have
some restrictions on the sites we can visit on government computers.
She hesitantly mentioned that Apples app store
is among the sites blocked by the FTCs security system. If she wants to
look at the most popular websites for mobile apps, she has to go to a
basement lab.
Farrell joined the conversation again.
Youre not going to make this a
gut-wrenching story about how Patti has to leave the confines of her
office to do her work?

the FTCs Bureau of Consumer Protection,
maintains an aura of secrecy
around the commissions testing labs.

The FTC maintains an aura of secrecy about its
testing labs in Washington.
Their location is known but not much else.
Officials would not talk about the equipment in the labs. Poss and Farrell
refused to divulge the number of iPhones and Androids, though it appears to
be not much more than a handful.
I dont want to lead you to think we have
an unlimited supply, Poss acknowledged before being discouraged from
acknowledging anything more.
It is hard for outsiders to know more because
the FTC refuses to let reporters visit the labs.
It was pointed out that government agencies conducting far more secret
operations - such as the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency -
often allow journalists and other outsiders to visit classified facilities.
The embedding program during the Iraq war gave
reporters the chance to report on the planning and execution of secret
military operations. The FTCs labs would not seem to rival the technology
displayed when journalists ride aboard nuclear-powered submarines, for
instance.
Vladeck would not bend.
We dont trust anybody, he said.
Current and former FTC officials say the labs
are the size of suburban living rooms, with computers and accessories that
do not look much different from what would be seen at a Kinkos.
Theres nothing special there, Soghoian
said. It looks like a computer room in a public library or middle
school.
Vladecks appointment, in 2009, was welcomed by
consumer-rights activists because of the nearly three decades he worked as a
crusading lawyer for Public Citizen, which was founded by Ralph Nader;
Vladeck has advocated long and hard for better government regulation.
A conversation with Vladeck, who has argued four
cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and won three of them, is akin to a
combative courtroom session. He often leans across the table and speaks in a
high-pitched bellow.
During an interview in his office, he said that
when he arrived at the FTC,
We werent geared up for this battle.
Thats partly because the Bush-era FTC was not
terribly aggressive on privacy but also because data mining has particularly
taken off in the past few years.
No regulator is ever going to tell you that
he or she is satisfied with the resources, Vladeck said.
Would I like more resources? Of course, and
I think I could put them to good use. But let me toot our own horn.
Weve gotten an enormous amount done in three years. I think we are
sending a strong signal to the industry - youve got to straighten up
and do the right thing.
Since he arrived, the FTC has reached
privacy settlements with the some of the
largest tech firms, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, though in each
case, there were no fines, because the FTCs authority to issue fines on a
first offense is limited.
The agency is like a runner with two sprained
ankles, because in addition to its narrow legal power, it has a surprisingly
small staff to pursue its legal cases.
Staffing at the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, which does the
bulk of the FTCs privacy work stayed flat at around 50 people even though
the data mining industry that it oversees has rapidly expanded; the industry
now employs more than 100,000 people and has revenues close to $5 billion,
according to industry analyst Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro.
There are about 20 lawyers working on privacy
cases at the FTC.
The bottlenecks are the lawyers for the
most part, Soghoian said.
And the FTC has another problem: Republican Rep.
John Mica, chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure, is
trying to evict the agency from its
headquarters, which is on a prime block of Pennsylvania Avenue.
Vladeck has improvised. He described his strategy as similar to highway cops
- the point isnt to catch every car that breaks the speed limit, but enough
to signal to the others that they cant get away with much. He goes after
the shiniest cars.
When we sue a company like Google and get
them under order for doing what we thought was a plain violation of the
FTC Act, which was making material changes to their privacy policy
without notifying people and getting their consent, the message we hope
we sent loud and clear was,
You cant do that. If were going to go
after Google, which is one of the biggest corporations in the world,
you can bet were going to go after you too.
Yet those cases demonstrated something else, too
- the FTCs limited power.
The agency was created in 1914 to prevent unfair
and deceptive practices in commerce. Unfairness is harder to prove in
privacy - whats inappropriate data collection to one person might be fair
and harmless to another - so the FTC is focusing enforcement efforts on
deception. That means a company has to say one thing about its
data-collection practices and do another.
But many companies have privacy policies that
say very little - in which case, they arent deceiving consumers if they do
things that might be untoward.
Ironically, the best way for a company to avoid privacy tussles with the FTC
is to not say much about their privacy practices. On the other side of
things, many companies protect themselves from prosecution by fully
disclosing their policies in dense legal jargon that few consumers bother to
read or, when they do, they have a hard time understanding that their
personal data will be collected and shared in nearly infinite ways.
Companies that follow these strategies - and
many do - are difficult targets for the FTC.
Big firms like Google and Facebook, which depend on consumers using their
services, cannot get away with having no policy at all or hiding behind
legal hieroglyphics. They are the shiny cars that the FTC pulls over when it
can. The
agency pounced when Google introduced its
Buzz social network because Gmail users were more or less swept into Buzz
without their consent, even though Google had previously said it would not
take unilateral action of that sort.
The agency can take companies to court, but its
overworked lawyers dont really have the time to go the distance against the
bottomless legal staffs in Silicon Valley.
The FTC
settled the Buzz case with Google, which
agreed to annual privacy audits for 20 years and promised to not lie to
consumers about what the company does with their data. If Google violates
the settlement, it then faces financial penalties that could be quite large
- this is akin to a two-strike rule.
The settlement process is time-consuming, however. Due to the agencys small
legal staff, some settlements take years to complete, and by the time
theyre done, the targeted companies are not what they used to be. Last
month, the FTC announced a
privacy settlement with MySpace, which it
accused of
disclosing user information to third parties
despite pledging not to do that.
The investigation was opened in 2009, when
MySpace was already a fading giant; by the time it was concluded in May,
MySpace was all but a museum artifact.
On Twitter, reaction to the suit included jokes
to the effect of,
You mean MySpace still exists?
Although the agency has some sway with Google
and other companies that are sensitive to reputational issues - an FTC
settlement might not hurt Googles bottom line but the bad press could - it
has less influence over data mining firms like Lexis Nexis, Choicepoint and
RapLeaf, whose revenues come mostly from businesses rather than consumers.
This is a major hole in the governments effort
to protect consumers from privacy violations, and the FTC has all but thrown
up its hands in futility. The privacy report it issued earlier this year
called on Congress to pass legislation that would set guidelines on
acceptable practices by data miners.
The odds of that happening are quite long,
because of industry opposition to government oversight and the difficulty of
getting agreement in Congress on what should and should not be allowed.

Even though he lives in university housing [TD5],
Jonathan Mayer is a star in the world of digital privacy; he is the
mop-haired kid who busted Google in his spare time.
Silicon Valley companies seek him out to learn
what hes up to. Mayer, being clever, uses these encounters to learn about
the companies. What are they thinking about the most? What do they fear the
most?
He has made another discovery.
The FTC doesnt strike fear into the heart
of tech companies, he says. They know that as long as they stay within
lax boundaries, its unlikely the FTC will bring enforcement actions
against them.
Google promised its cars were only taking
pictures, and the firms word was enough for U.S. officials.
Yet there is a feared privacy watchdog, Mayer notes: the European Union.
American companies have far less political influence in Europe, and
Europeans are far more attentive to privacy issues, partly due to memories
of Nazi-era totalitarianism. Because most tech services offered to Europeans
are the same as offered to Americans, protections required by EU regulators
are usually extended to American consumers.
Its the globalization of digital regulation:
What happens in one country can affect all countries.
For instance, under Irish privacy law, citizens are entitled to know the
information a company possesses on them - and this was used against Facebook
by a 24-year-old Austrian, Max Schrems, who asked the company to hand over
all the data it had on him.
Facebooks international headquarters are
located in Dublin, so the firm had to comply. Last year it
gave Schrems more than 1,200 pages of data
that included just about every keystroke he had made while on the social
network, including items he had deleted and location information he had
never provided.
Facebook had kept almost every poke and like,
every friend and defriend, every invitation accepted or rejected. Schrems
posted the information online and compared his Facebook dossier to the data
that the East German secret police, the Stasi, had kept on millions of
citizens.
In effect, Schrems exposed Facebooks data retention practices, and this led
to a big change. In May, Facebook said its 900 million customers - not just
the ones in Europe - would receive far more detail on its data collection,
making it easier for them to know what information was being collected and
what was being done with it.
The company acknowledged that the change was the
result of a harsh report issued by Irish authorities looking into the
Schrems case. Ireland wasnt trying to protect the privacy rights of
Americans, but its pressure on Facebook had precisely that effect.
The outsourcing of consumer data protection has been going on for a number
of years. In 2008, European privacy officials asked Google, Microsoft and
Yahoo! to delete, far quicker than they were doing, the data they were
retaining about user searches.
In short order, the search giants complied - not
only for their European customers but for Americans, too.
The EU drives regulation worldwide, Mayer
says. While we make nods to self-regulation and cooperation, the
reality is that the EU is getting all of this done.
The power of Europes privacy regulators - and
the weakness of Americas - was demonstrated most vividly in the Street View
dustup.
While there was only modest protest against
Google photographing American streets and homes, the company immediately ran
into big trouble when its cars began to roam around Europe. The collection
and abuse of personal information was a hallmark of not only the Nazi regime
and its allies during the World War II era, but of the communist regimes
that ruled Eastern Europe during the Cold War.
Throughout Europe, local and national
authorities expressed concerns about Street View, and the project quickly
hit a number of walls.
Google promised its cars were only taking pictures - and the firms word was
enough for U.S. officials - but French authorities demanded to know for
sure. They inspected one of the vehicles in 2010 and realized that Google
was not telling the whole story: The hard drives in the cars were
downloading data from Wi-Fi networks.
Google downplayed the revelation by contending
the downloads were innocuous - just technical data, not personal
information.
In Germany, where popular opposition to Street View was strongest, the data
commissioner of Hamburg, Johannes Caspar, demanded to inspect a
Street View car, too. At first,
Google reportedly told him it didnt know
where the cars were. The firm eventually found one - but its hard drive was
gone. At that point, Google said it was taking a new look at what the cars
were downloading.
Caspar insisted the company hand over a hard
drive. After a few months, Google complied. Caspar discovered that Google
had downloaded vast amounts of personal data.
It had done the same in the United States.
Vladeck had a quick response when it was suggested the Europeans were better
privacy watchdogs.
Thats a lie, he shot back.
He leaned forward, speaking a bit more slowly.
That is a lie.
He argued that although the Germans uncovered
Street Views data collection, the FTC was not asleep at the wheel because
it was investigating Street View at the time.
But Vladeck said the FTC could not have done
much even if it had examined a hard drive, since the agencys reach extends
only to unfair or deceptive practices. Google had never told consumers it
wasnt downloading Wi-Fi data, so it hadnt deceived them by doing so.
To prove an unfair practice, the FTC would have
needed to show that the data downloads caused consumers an unavoidable harm.
Street View would have been a very
difficult case for us, Vladeck said.
The agency quietly closed its investigation in
late 2010 with no action.
Google was not yet free of the governments watchdogs. The Federal
Communications Commission conducted a separate investigation of its own and
discovered the data collection was not accidental, as Google had claimed
once it owned up to downloading the data.
The FCC sharply criticized Google in April
but fined the company just $25,000, which
is not even a rounding error in the web giants first quarter profit of
$2.89 billion.
