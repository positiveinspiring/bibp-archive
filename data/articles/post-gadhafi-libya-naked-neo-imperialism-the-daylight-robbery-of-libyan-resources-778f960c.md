While the unconcealed hypocrisy that led to the
emergence of a new Libya fades from the public consciousness, the
governments of the West are beginning to reap the profits of their
investments.
Sarkozy,
Mustafa Abdel Jalil, Cameron
Under a mandate to protect civilians, these
allied forces armed radical factions of Islamist fighters and showered white
phosphorus tipped ordnance onto densely populated residential areas.
While sponsoring politicians equated the Libyan
rebels to heroic advocates of western democracy fighting for freedom, these
men committed racially motivated beheadings and executions of migrant
workers from sub-Saharan Africa and filled mass graves with the corpses of
their fellow countrymen, Gaddafi loyalists.
Before being sodomized with a combat knife and extra judicially assassinated
by foreign funded rebel fighters, Muammar Gadhafi oversaw one of
Africas most prosperous nations.
With an annual economic growth of 10% and
extensive programs for social welfare, public healthcare and education,
Libya was viewed as a place of relative opportunity with numerous jobs for
migrant workers from neighboring countries in the region.
Gadhafi advocated the creation of,
an African
Union with its own Central Bank and Monetary Fund and a Gold Dinar
currency,
...a move that would directly threaten the financial oligarchy of the
Franco-Anglo-American powers that funded his demise.
In the crumbling ruins of the new Libya under hard-line Sharia law, the
abduction and subsequent atrocities against former Gadhafi loyalists are
commonplace.
As the revolutionary vigor dies down, the seeds
of civil war between tribal lines of the armed rebel factions may foment at
any moment. It is upon this unstable foundation that an economic
protectorate is being born.
In exchange for being brought to power,
representatives from Libyas National Transitional Council (NTC) have recently
visited their former colonial administrators in London to begin awarding
contracts to insidious corporate entities who will be commissioned to
rebuild the country's bombarded infrastructure.
The disingenuous Franco-Anglo-American architects of post-Gadhafi Libya are
now being given free reign to economically exploit the country they helped
devastate. Irrespective of the moral and ethical consequences of their
plunder, the colonial administrations investment of $500 million USD to
oust Gadhafi will result in a projected yield of $300 billion USD over a
ten-year period.
As shares rise for Shell and British Petroleum,
staff members of the UK Department for Trade and Investment have begun to
establish themselves in Libya.
In exchange for French warplanes over the skies
of Tripoli, the NTC allegedly promised to grant 35% of its oil contracts to
the French oil conglomerate, Total, a corrupted corporate body complicit in
the use of forced labor during its pipeline operations in Myanmar.
Much to the denial of the French Government, the
company has been approved to begin onshore oil extraction in the upcoming
year.
While places such as Sirte sit in ruin, opportunist American businessmen
scour for building contracts.
Richard Peters, a construction firm owner
whose company is also involved in rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan after the
subsequent US-led occupations has advocated the construction of golf courses
and a
Disney Land, suggesting that the Libyan people could really do with a
little entertainment.
On a recent trip to Libya, John Laughland
from the Institute for Democracy and Cooperation reported that the NTC was
fully aware that the Libyan assets frozen in western banks would be unfrozen
and redistributed to the nations originally responsible for orchestrating
the NATO bombardment.
As an economic client state masquerading as a
liberated nation, the new Libyan regime owes its entire sovereignty and
legitimacy to colonial European powers responsible for fomenting anarchy and
civil war within their country.
It is interesting to note that the NTC declined business opportunities to
countries opposed to the way NATO interpreted its mandate, such as,
Several billion dollars worth of construction
and arms contracts between Russia and Gadhafis government are now contested
and subject to revaluation.
In 2010, China was the recipient of 11% of
Libyas oil exports and maintained approximately 30,000 workers in Libya
through Chinas National Petroleum Corporation.
It remains unclear if these nations will be able
to fully reclaim their business interests in the country.
While corporate opportunists talk of developing Libya to become the next
Dubai, cases of political executions and atrocities against Gadhafi
loyalists are a non-issue to the NTC and major media outlets of the West.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen
proclaims,
Our military forces prevented a massacre
and saved countless lives, upon the recent discovery of three hundred
alleged Gaddafi supporters who were executed with their hands bound.
Tragically, the Libyan people themselves fail to
recognize that their country has been usurped.
Abdullah Naker of the Tripoli
Revolutionists Council recently released the following statement,
We've seen many examples in the past when
peoples' revolutions were stolen and we are very clear that our struggle
is far from over. Gadhafi may still come back - in some other shape or
form - and in that case, we will have to take up our weapons and defend
our revolution.
Unfortunately, Nakers proverbial Gadhafi has
already returned
and hes wearing a five thousand dollar business suit...
