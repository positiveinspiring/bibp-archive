If You Still Think You Are Ready For Cosmic Awareness, read on:
Are you among the few who can question your own most cherished beliefs? If so, you are ready for Cosmic Awareness.
Are you among the few who can listen to beliefs and ideas of others which are in conflict with your own, not to find fault with these, but to examine them for any possible value to yourself? If so, you are ready for Cosmic Awareness.
Are you among the few who can conceive of the possibility of a Universe which is itself a living, conscious being that is aware of all of its parts, loves them all, and whose parts may change but never die? If so, then you are ready for Cosmic Awareness.
Are you among the few who can imagine your soul to be a cell in the body of that Universal Being? A soul or cell that is the image of the Universal Creator, even as your own cells contain the DNA coded image of yourself? If so, you are ready for Cosmic Awareness.
Are you among the few who can conceive of the possibility that the biblical story of the Garden of Eden might just be a story of your own birth and consciousness? That the Garden of Eden was the womb, Adam the conscious mind, Eve the subconscious, their expulsion from the garden being your birth into this earth, the serpent being the Kundalini energies, the Tree of Knowledge as the rational consciousness based only upon the fruit of the five external senses, with the Tree of Wisdom representing the entire holy (whole or cosmic) consciousness? If so, you are ready for Cosmic Awareness.
Are you among the few who can conceive of the possibility that the Christ is actually a level of consciousness, a Christ Consciousness. Crystal Clear, born of virgin purity, that spoke through Christ, to tell the people the Way, the Truth and the Light through the Crystal Consciousness to the Kingdom of Heaven within oneself? If so, you are ready for Cosmic Awareness.
Are you among the few who look beyond the teacher of the message to the message itself, to study its value in your life? If so, you are ready for Cosmic Awareness.
Are you among the few who could read the messages from Cosmic Awareness and neither believe nor disbelieve, but use them to stimulate your thoughts and launch your own consciousness toward search and discovery for yourself? If so, you are ready for Cosmic Awareness.
Are you among the few who can conceive of surrendering yourself to die into a universal consciousness, to live in this world but be not of it, knowing yourself to be a Universal Being expressing through the physical body but not being trapped in it or owing your conscious existence to it; are you capable of seeing the body as your carriage, while being aware that you as driver of the carriage may come and go from it if you desire? If so, you are ready for Cosmic Awareness.
If you are among those millions who are not ready for Cosmic Awareness,
it would
waste your time to read on; but if you are among the few who are ready for
Cosmic Awareness, indeed this message is for you. Read on.
Cosmic Awareness Comes Like a Thief in the Night To Establish a New Age, A New
World, A New Millennium. While there can only be one Universal Truth, there are
thousands and thousands of organized religions and spiritual cults upon this
earth, each claiming and sincerely believing itself to be the truest and best of
all possible religions.
Each has some special piece of evidence to use as proof of its authority and
claims. These claims are based on any or several of the following kinds of
evidence:
(Examples showing the absurdity of using such evidence as proof, follow each
one.)
Proof from Authority "It must be so, our leaders say it's so."
Proof from a group of Authorities "They all say so, it must be so."
Proof from Antiquity "It was written in 10,000 B.C. so It must be true."
Proof from Circumstance "I asked for a sign and the dog barked, it must be so."
Proof from Friends "All my friends do it, it must be OK."
Proof from Phenomena "He gave me a drink of something and it cured my pain, he must be the Messiah."
Proof from Self-Proclamation "I wouldn't say it if it were not so."
Proof from Feeling "It hurts so much it must be helping."
Proof from Investment "Everybody is paying so much for it, it must be valid."
Proof from Confusion "I can't understand it, so I'll have to believe in it."
Proof from Popularity "Everyone says the world is flat, except you, Columbus."
Proof from Misinterpreted Evidence "For many years now it has turned cold after the leaves have fallen from the trees. Therefore, we must fasten the leaves more securely to keep the weather warm."
Proof from Charisma "Look at that face, the smile, those eyes, that hair and mustache, how can you not be devoted to him? Heil Hitler!"
Proof From Inner Guidance "A voice in my head said it was OK to steal, so I stole it."
Proof from Credentials "The sign said: "Honest John's Used Cars," so naturally l assumed..."
Proof from General Faith "We all thought the world would end on March 1, so we sold our homes to Joe, threw a farewell party and got roaring drunk."
Proof from Association "I ate six apples on the full moon, six months later I married a werewolf. Don't eat apples on a full moon."
Proof from Packaging "It must be valuable because it has expensive paper, leather binding, gold ink, violet ribbon, antique printing -- but what's that ticking sound inside?"
Proof from Dedication "Four million followers have been martyred for him. He must be a true and wonderful leader for our people."
Proof from Power "He has destroyed his every enemy, he has made the mountains quake, he has caused the sea to swallow up the land, he has created chaos out of order, who can doubt his wisdom? Who dares doubt his wisdom?
Those "Proofs" Have Been the Basis for Most Religions on Earth
From examining
the above and the religions and spiritual organizations in the world, it becomes
increasingly clear that people of the earth have long lived with illusions,
lies, false Gods, and absurdities called Truth. Essentially earth people are
misled and unrealistic in an unrealistic world.
One may ask if there is any possible way to find reality and truth, or must
life's mysteries be always answered by answers based on faith in those answers?
Since 1963 Cosmic Awareness has been communicating through certain carefully
trained channels. It has given thousands and thousands of pages of information
on almost every imaginable question.
There has been enough information given to start a dozen religions; in fact
portions of the teachings have been used to help start various spiritual groups,
studies and organizations, some which have grown quite prosperous from only a
small portion of the Awareness information. Yet, with all the verifications and
priceless information -- enough to convince the world's most ardent skeptics if
they took the time to check it out -- Awareness still suggests that we not
believe it without checking for ourselves.
It never tells us what to believe, it suggests and indicates areas for us to
look for likely truths. Above all else, above any other teaching It offers, It
suggests that we question, doubt, explore, to discover for ourselves, to study
different religions, sciences, psychologies and various fields of learning but
to never assume we KNOW anything, for when we think we KNOW, we cease to be open
to further learning except when that learning supports our assumed knowledge.
Ninety percent of all religious teachings are designed to manipulate minds and
emotions to catch, hold and extract energy and devotion from its followers,
while only 10 percent of such teachings are truly priceless and valuable to
one's social, physical and spiritual welfare.
We encourage people to search out the highest and the best in every religion or
science, to take the 10 percent that is priceless and throw the rest away as the
garbage which it is, for it clutters our living space if we keep it around. We,
who have been receiving and studying the Cosmic Awareness messages since 1963
have familiarized ourselves with many key concepts of Awareness that have
created some profound changes in our consciousness.
We have come from a variety of religious backgrounds: Catholic, Protestant,
Jewish, Buddhist, Spiritualist, Atheist, Agnostic and others, and all have been
enriched by the Cosmic Awareness messages. We realize that while Cosmic
Awareness is ready to accept everyone, not everyone is ready to accept Cosmic
Awareness.
It has asked us to prepare the Earth for the coming changes in consciousness,
for it has indicated that within two to four generations 80 percent of all
people on Earth will be living in states of Cosmic Awareness, yet hardly anyone
has the least understanding of what the term "Cosmic Awareness" means.
As heat turns ice to water, water to steam and steam to air, so Cosmic Awareness
melts one's crystallized thought patterns into emotions, ideas, feelings,
expanded consciousness and finally Into the Universal spirit of the virgin-born
purity of the Christ of Crystal Clear Consciousness which is the Heavenly or
Universal Spirit of God.
Then speaking as that Crystal Consciousness, one can truly say: "I and the
Father, are One."
Its time has come, ready or not. Cosmic Awareness asks not
that you sacrifice, not that you believe, not that you bow in worship to It, but
that you love one another, serve one another, and that you become aware --
cosmically aware. We invite you to check it out. You may be ready for this new
adventure in your life..
