Iran's judiciary system recently worked through
the biggest banking fraud case in the nation's history. According to The
New York Times, the outcome of the case was made official on Monday.
Results were dramatic to say the least.
Judiciary spokesman Gholam-Hossein
Mohseni-Ejei told reporters that four people had been officially
sentenced to death on charges of corruption and,
disrupting the country's economic system.
The guilty party was responsible for mishandling
$2.6 billion of funds - using forged documents in order to receive credit
from banks, permitting them to purchase state-owned companies.
From
PressTV:
According to
the indictment, the owners of Aria Investment Development
Company, which is at the center of
the controversy, had bribed bank managers to get loans and letters of
credit.
The company
has more than 35 offshoots which are active in diverse business
activities.
The
four are,
-
Mahafarid Amir-Khosravi
[the prime suspect]
-
Behdad Behzadi, his legal advisor
-
Iraj Shoja, his financial solicitor
-
Saeed Kiani Rezazadeh, head of the Ahvaz branch
of Saderat Bank,
...he
[Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei] said.
Additionally, the president of the Bank Melli
branch in Kish was condemned to life in prison.
The former deputy minister Khodamorad Ahmadi
has been ordered to spend a decade in prison as well, according to Iran's
attorney general, Mohseni-Ejei. Several others involved in this infamous
scandal have also been slapped with heavy fines and many have also been
prohibited from holding public office.
Economist Nouriel Roubini added his two
cents on the subject, reporting to Bloomberg:
Bankers are
greedy; theyve been greedy for the last hundreds of years... its not a
question if they are more immoral today then they were a thousand years
ago, you have to make sure they behave in ways in which you minimize
those risks.
This message surely hits a little too close to
home for central bankers across the globe who have been engaged with fraud
and corruption in the past or present.
Constituents and political leaders spend a big
chunk of time debating over how to deal with our crumbling economy.
Ending system abuse from insiders and
the
FED alike would undoubtedly have a positive ripple effect, but
how is that goal going to be achieved? Thus far, not a single
chief central banker has been arrested in light of
the
financial crisis.
This is completely asinine.
They keep making more money, while we struggle
to thrive in the middle class. The brutal truth is that banks prosper when
people are on welfare. They're invested in keeping you down and could care
less about your American Dream.
Perhaps Iran is on to something by enforcing
real consequences when insiders mess with the country's entire economic
system. The death sentence decision is obviously harsh (Iran's justice
system is pretty
harsh in general).
Alas, what's decided cannot be undone. They said
they are trying to set an example.
Elite criminals shouldn't be treated differently than any other
criminal; they should be prosecuted, not protected.
