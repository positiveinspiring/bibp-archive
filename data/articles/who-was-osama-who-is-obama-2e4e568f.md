While the President and Commander in Chief of
the United States of America,
Barack Hussein Obama
"celebrates" the first anniversary of the
alleged death of bin Laden, the substantive issue as to
WHO WAS OSAMA BIN LADEN remains unheralded (remarks by President
Obama in Address to the Nation from Bagram Air Base,
Afghanistan, see video at foot of article.)
Through lies and fabrications - which he intends to use in his election
campaign - president Obama's carefully scripted speech upholds a world of
total fantasy, in which "bad guys" are lurking and "plotting acts of
terror".
Meanwhile, Islamic "jihadists" are said to be
threatening Western civilization.
Each and every statement in Obama's May 1st speech at Bagram Air
Force base regarding the role of Al Qaeda is a fabrication: (below
are excerpts from Obama's Remarks in italics, author's comments are
indicated inside square brackets [ ] ):
It was here, in Afghanistan, where Osama bin
Laden established a safe haven for his terrorist organization
[Osama
bin Laden was recruited by the CIA, Al Qaeda was set up with
the support of the CIA. Osama's safe haven was protected by US
intelligence] .
It was here, in Afghanistan, where al
Qaeda brought new recruits, trained them, and plotted acts of terror.
[The Mujahedeen were recruited and trained by the CIA. America's ally
Saudi Arabia financed the Wahabbi koranic schools, Ronald Reagan praised
the Mujahedeen as "Freedom Fighters". Unknown to the American public,
the US spread the teachings of the "Islamic jihad"
in textbooks "Made in America",
developed at the University of Nebraska]
It was here, from within these
borders, that al Qaeda launched the attacks that killed nearly 3,000
innocent men, women and children.
[Obama is referring to the tragic events of September 11 2001. To this
date there is no evidence that Al Qaeda was involved in the 9/11
attacks. Moreover, confirmed by CBS News,
on September 10, 2001 Osama bin Laden had been
admitted to a Pakistani military hospital in Rawalpindi,
courtesy of America's ally Pakistan. Did he coordinate the 9/11 attacks
from his hospital bed?]
And so, 10 years ago, the United
States and our allies went to war to make sure that al Qaeda could never
again use this country to launch attacks against us.
[The 9/11 attacks was the justification for waging war on Afghanistan on
the grounds of` "self defense". Afghanistan was said to be harboring Al
Qaeda and was, therefore, complicit in an outright act of war against
the USA.
The fact of the matter is that the Taliban government on two occasions
in the weeks following 9/11 offered (through diplomatic channels) to
hand over Osama bin Laden to the US Justice system. President George W.
Bush refused the offer of the Taliban government, intimating that
America "does not negotiate with terrorists".
NATO went to war in support of the US, invoking Article Five of the
Washington Treaty. The latter states that an "act of war" against one
member of the Atlantic Alliance is considered "an act of war" against
all members of NATO under the doctrine of collective security.]
Despite initial success, for a number
of reasons, this war has taken longer than most anticipated. In 2002,
bin Laden and his lieutenants escaped across the border and established
safe haven in Pakistan. America spent nearly eight years fighting a
different war in Iraq. And al Qaedas extremist allies within the
Taliban have waged a brutal insurgency.
[The whereabouts of Osama bin Laden have always been known to US
intelligence. President Obama conveys the illusion that US-NATO forces
and their intelligence operatives could not find bin Laden. In the words
of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld (2002),
"it is like searching for a needle in a
stack of hay".
The alleged Al Qaeda safe haven in Pakistan
serves as a pretext for waging drone attacks against alleged terrorists
in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).
President Obama also intimates that Al Qaeda operatives equipped with
stinger missiles and Kalashnikovs had managed to outsmart the US-NATO
multi-trillion dollar military machine.]
But over the last three years, the
tide has turned. We broke the Talibans momentum. Weve built strong
Afghan security forces. We devastated al Qaedas leadership, taking out
over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And one year ago, from a base here in
Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin
Laden.
[A lot has been written on this issue. No proof as to the identity of
the person who was allegedly killed by the Seals Special Forces.
In the words of Paul Craig Roberts:
"The US governments bin Laden story was
so poorly crafted that it did not last 48 hours before being
fundamentally altered..." ]
The goal that I set - to defeat al Qaeda and
deny it a chance to rebuild - is now within our reach.
[There is ample evidence that Al Qaeda (a US sponsored "intelligence
asset") is still alive and fully operational. Officially, the goal is to
"defeat Al Qaeda". Unofficially, Al Qaeda is supported covertly by US
intelligence.
Since 9/11, Al Qaeda has developed into a multinational entity with
"subsidiaries" in various geopolitical hotspots around the world.
In Libya and Syria, Al Qaeda brigades are the foot soldiers of the
US-NATO military alliance. Wherever the US military and intelligence
apparatus is deployed, Al Qaeda is present:
Al Qaeda in Iraq, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the Libya
Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), Al Shaabab (Somalia), Al-Qaeda in the
Islamic Maghreb, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) (Army of Mohammed) (Pakistan),
Jemaah Islamiya organization (JI) (Indonesia) Islamic Movement of
Uzbekistan, etc. (See US State Department
Foreign Terrorist Organizations, United
Nations Security Council, List of individuals, groups, undertakings and
other entities associated with Al-Qaida
Al-Qaida Sanctions List)
In a bitter irony, in all these countries, US intelligence is covertly
coordinating the activities of Al Qaeda affiliated groups. Officially
counterterrorism consists in fighting the "Islamic jihad" Unofficially
through covert operations, Western intelligence supports their "assets"
including terror entities on
the US State Department list.
Moreover, these various terrorist organizations are now being used in
US-NATO covert military operations against sovereign countries (e.g.
Libya and Syria).
According to Israeli intelligence sources:
"NATO headquarters in Brussels and the
Turkish high command are meanwhile drawing up plans for their first
military step in Syria, which is to arm the rebels with weapons for
combating the tanks and helicopters spearheading the Assad regime's
crackdown on dissent.
Instead of repeating the Libyan model of air
strikes, NATO strategists are thinking more in terms of pouring
large quantities of anti-tank and anti-air rockets, mortars and
heavy machine guns into the protest centers for beating back the
government armored forces." (DEBKAfile, NATO to give rebels
anti-tank weapons, August 14, 2011) ]

fighters
Who is or was Osama?
An "intelligence asset", namely an instrument of the CIA used to justify the
"Global
War on Terrorism".
It is worth recalling that on September 14, 2001, both the House and the
Senate adopted a historical resolution authorizing the president to "go
after" countries which "aided
the
[9/11] terrorist attacks":
The president is authorized to use all
necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or
persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the
terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such
organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of
international terrorism against the United States by such nations,
organizations or persons.
Today in 2012, there is ample evidence that:
-
Al Qaeda was not behind the 9/11 attacks
on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon.
-
There is also detailed evidence that
agencies of the US government as well as NATO, continue to support
and "harbor such organizations" [Al Qaeda and its affiliated
organizations]. In Libya, the "pro-democracy" rebels were led by Al
Qaeda paramilitary brigades under the supervision of NATO Special
Forces.
The "Liberation" of Tripoli was carried
out by "former" members of the Libya Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG).
The jihadists and NATO work hand in glove.
These "former" Al Qaeda affiliated brigades in
Libya were the backbone of the "pro-democracy" rebellion.
-
There is evidence that the WTC towers
were brought down through controlled demolition, raising the
possibility of complicity and cover-up within the US government,
intelligence and military.

Undisputed Facts Point to the Controlled
Demolition of WTC 7, Global Research, March 2008, see

of the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings on September 11, 2001,

Who is Obama?
A political liar and a war criminal.
Obama's scripted speeches are slanted distortions. Realities are turned
upside down. Acts of war are heralded as peace-making operations...
Ironically, the text of the September 14, 2001 Congressional resolution (see
above) does not exclude judicial action and criminal investigation directed
against the US-NATO sponsors of international terrorism, including president
Obama, who have used the tragic events of 9/11 as a pretext to wage,
"a war without borders" under the
humanitarian banner of the "Global War on Terrorism" (GWOT).
Obama versus
Romney
In the election campaign opposing Barack Obama to Mitt Romney, Osama and the
"threat of Al Qaeda" will be "center stage".
Supported by carefully crafted public relations campaigns, each of the
presidential candidates will present - within the realm of a world of sheer
fantasy - their "Al Qaeda -Global War on Terrorism platform" to the American
people. In this ritual, Al Qaeda becomes the central talking point of the
campaign; all real major issues including the economic crisis, poverty in
America and the devastations of war will be conveniently side-stepped.
