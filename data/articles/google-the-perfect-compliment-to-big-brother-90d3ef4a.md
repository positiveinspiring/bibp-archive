The European Union (EU) is claiming that Google overstepped its bounds
as a
monopoly.
Officials in the EU have been conducting
anti-trust investigation into Googles treatment of search term results.
I believe that these fast-moving markets
would particularly benefit from a quick resolution of the competition
issues identified, said Joaqu√≠n Almunia, the head of competition policy
for the European Commission.
Restoring competition swiftly to the
benefit of users at an early stage is always preferable to lengthy
proceedings, although these sometimes become indispensable to
competition enforcement.
Alumunia said that Google is becoming a
dominant abuser with regard to its business practices.
In its general search results, Google
displays links to its own vertical search services differently than it
does for links to competitors, Almunia said.
We are concerned that this may result in
preferential treatment compared to those of competing services, which
may be hurt as a consequence.
The truth about Googles rise as an abusive
dominating force does not come from this petty argument over search terms,
but how the internet giant is working with governmental agencies to mine for
data on unsuspecting citizens.
Recently, a US Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia, ruled that
the NSA
does not need to confirm nor deny (known as a Glomar response) its
collaborations with Google; how the two work together to spy on American
citizens in the name of 'protecting the public' from false flag
cyber-attacks.
The existence of a relationship or
communications between the NSA and any private company certainly
constitutes an activity of the agency subject to protection from
public disclosure, said Judge Janice Rogers Brown.
Moreover, if private entities knew that any
of their attempts to reach out to NSA could be made public through a
FOIA request, they might hesitate or decline to contact the agency,
thereby hindering its Information Assurance mission.
In reviewing an agencys Glomar response, this court exercises caution
when the information requested implicates national security, a uniquely
executive purview. NSA need not make a specific showing of potential
harm to national security in order to justify withholding information.
Prior to this ruling, Google was involved in a
violation of wire-tapping laws by stealing private citizens
personal data
through their unmanned vehicles called street view cars.
During the investigation in the violation, Google obstructed information
from reaching investigators, says the Electronic Privacy Information
Center (EPIC).
EPICs director, Marc Rotenberg stated:
Much of the information uncovered by the
FCCs investigation was redacted, and Googles obstruction prevented the
agency from determining the merits of the underlying substantive issues:
whether Googles interception of Wi-Fi communications violated the
Wiretap Act, Rotenberg argued.
Finally, the FCC ignored legal precedent
holding that the contents of unencrypted Wi-Fi networks were protected
by the Wiretap Act.
Googles Android has the ability to use
ambient background noise of an individuals environment
to spy on them.
Their activities will be targeted to more efficiently advertise to them
through their technological devices.
Google will use your private conversations, music preferences, favorite
shows and radio stations - anything in your immediate environment to build a
profile on you. Thanks to Googles Android and similar smartphones
the patent for this surveillance technology will allow our phones to become
spies.
Google has morphed into a monster. They spy on citizens, collect private
data, and assist the US government in creating profiles on each and every
citizen in America.
That is the evidence of a domineering abuser.
