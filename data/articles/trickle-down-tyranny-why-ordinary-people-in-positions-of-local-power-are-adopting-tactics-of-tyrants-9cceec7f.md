Are Adopting Tactics of Tyrants

When I read a story yesterday about an
89-year-old woman being water-boarded by nursing home staff over an argument
about ice cream, I knew something terrible was amiss across the American
landscape.
Spontaneous acts of tyranny have been cropping
up lately like cancer tumors:
I watched all this with a sense of sadness and disgrace for the human race.
And then a realization hit me like a sledgehammer...
People are only
following by example
These random acts of tyranny aren't really random acts at all.
They are the
infantile acting-out of behaviors the childish American public has witnessed
being demonstrated by their "leaders."
The TSA sexually molesting air
travelers isn't just a violation of fundamental human rights - it's also a
demonstration to the mindless masses that this is now "normal" behavior in
society, you see.
So as the masses observe Big Government reaching down their own pants, they
now get the message that it's okay to sexually molest little boys at sports
stadiums, or that it's okay to take children away from parents through C.P.S.
and then rape them as part of child relocation "processing" procedures.
When the American people see
George Bush set up secret military prisons and
condone waterboarding torture techniques, they called for
Obama to stop the
practice.
Obama promised he would, and then not long after becoming
President, he expanded Gitmo and actually presided over an increase in
funding for the military and all its secret torture facilities.
The message to the American people? If Obama supports it, then torture must
be okay.
After all, he won a Nobel 'Peace' Prize, so "peace" must be something
that can be achieved through torture. Thus, we should not be at all
surprised when an 89-year-old woman gets water-boarded in a nursing home.
After all, those staffers are only doing to her what they've watched the
U.S. leaders do to other human beings, too.
(And yet, for some reason, the
nursing home staff were arrested while all the high-level government
operatives who engage in the exact same torture techniques are never even
questioned...)
This phenomenon of everyday American people mirroring the behavior of
federal "authorities" who act as tyrants needed a name, and as I began to
ponder this issue, the name came to me in a flash:
I'm calling this phenomenon Trickle-Down Tyranny.
Trickle-Down Tyranny
Just as children mimic the actions of their parents, the childish minds of
the insecure (and fear-pummeled) mainstream masses also mimic the actions of
their parental role models.
To many Americans - and especially those of a
more liberal mindset - government takes on the role of their parents. The
government is supposed to tell you what to eat, what to buy, what to believe
and of course how to express your patriotism when needed to justify the
latest war launched by a Nobel-Peace-Prize-winning warmonger.
Government is
the "authority" and the problem solver in the lives of these people. So
naturally, in their childish mindset they seek to replicate the behaviors
their parental role models are openly exhibiting.
Here's how this looks on the street:
Your average city police officer is a
wannabe tyrant who now, by watching the criminality of the federal
government, feels he has permission to engage in the same tactics of
intimidation and arrogance in ruling over the public (rather than serving to
protect them).
That's why so many big-city police officers have recently
morphed into,
-
paramilitary jack-booted thugs dressing
in black
-
unlawfully arresting people for no
justifiable reason
-
tasering innocent victims in
wheelchairs,
...and generally acting out what is essentially a childish
reflection of the very same tyranny they witness being demonstrated by
high-level tyrants in Washington D.C.
The FBI, for its part, is busy actually masterminding the very same "terror
plots" that it then magically "prevents" with great fanfare.
As
recently
exposed in The Guardian (and other newspapers), the FBI
actually develops terror plots, provides the plans, weapons, funding,
motivation and equipment necessary for these "terrorists" to carry out those
plots.
This is a whole lot like playing a "big-boy" version of Cowboys and Indians,
where all the scenarios are completely fabricated merely for the purpose of
playing games as a source of entertainment.
Trickle-Down Tyranny is also now being seen in local schools, where
"zero-tolerance" rules get children kicked out of the public education
system for merely bringing a butter knife in their home-packed lunch, for
example.
Or a child caught with an aspirin tablet is labeled a "drug abuser"
and condemned to special remediation classes.
The tyrants are
everywhere in American society now
Think about the tyrants that have now descended upon you in your own life - the tyrant down at the DMV, the tyrant dog license enforcer, the tyrant
building inspector and the tyrant food service worker, also sometimes known
as "soup Nazi."
When you really think about it, there are tyrants everywhere now in American
culture.
The fabric of fear and terror is being woven into that fabric with
every "the threat level is now orange" alert put out by
George Bush, or
every "spy on your neighbors" message broadcast by the ogre of offensive
tyrants, DHS head Janet Napolitano.
What these people claim to be doing - "stopping terrorism!" - pales in
comparison to what they're really doing: setting examples to be followed by
every single person across America who finds himself or herself in a
position of authority.
We'll just ALL be tyrants!
Terrorizing innocents
is now politically correct behavior
Through its moronic (and completely fabricated)
war on terror, the national
leadership in the USA has made it politically correct to terrorize anyone
over whom you exercise power.
If you're a librarian, you can terrorize
little children over past-due books (that is, if children actually read
books at all anymore). If you're a septic tank inspector, you can terrorize
people over the layout of their septic pipes. If you're a doctor, you can
terrorize people over flu shots and chemotherapy, all being aggressively
pushed with the very same fear tactics now used at the highest levels of
national government.
The impact of all this is even international: Egypt's secret police group,
famous for torturing dissidents, has
just renamed itself "Homeland Security"
in what appears to be homage to the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security.
"Should we be concerned that a
dictatorship which refuses to bow to the will of the people and allow
democratic elections to proceed while engaging in savage attacks on
demonstrators is re-naming itself after Americas foremost post-9/11 federal
agency?" writes Paul Joseph Watson.
"Egyptian authorities are justifying
their brutal crackdown against protesters, with dozens killed over the last
few days, by pointing to how U.S. law enforcement bodies are taking a "firm
stance" against Occupy Wall Street protesters."
Trickle-down tyranny happens because the political leaders of America have
broadcast a message across the nation that terrorizing innocent people is
not merely okay, but downright patriotic!
Anyone who says they're not going
along with all,
...is immediately branded an
"extremist."
It's now "extreme," you see, to not believe in torture and
home-grown terror as a way to keep the sheeple in line.
"Extremism" is now
defined as opening your eyes, asking some commonsense questions, and
refusing to follow the hypnotized masses as they are marched off a high
cliff by the globalist population controllers.
Merely thinking for yourself, it turns out, is now "extreme."
It's a brave
new world after all, I suppose.
Fear and paranoia
...is being marketed to the public in an attempt to
transform the citizenry into a grand spy ring
The social acceptance of spying on your neighbors and promoting fear has
reached a new fervor across America, very nearly reflecting that of Nazi
Germany in the late 1930's.
It's now okay to call 911 on somebody merely
because they happen to be writing something down on a scrap of paper in a
public park (that's one of the signs of possible terrorism, according to
ludicrous DHS public service videos that only breed paranoid thinking). It's
now okay to spy on everyone around you and secretly observe them to see what
they're doing.
It's now your duty to watch over every scrap of luggage at
the airport and start screaming about terror threats if some poor sap walks
more than 10 feet away from his bags for a few seconds.
Recently, East Carolina University was thrust into a state of "lock down"
for 3 hours after some spy-on-your-neighbor citizens reported a man walking
around with an "assault rifle."
That assault rifle, of course, turned out to
be
nothing more than a black umbrella.
But this is the level of outrageous hallucinations and total lunatic
paranoia that has been unleashed on the American people today by a
fear-mongering, imperialist government which worships fear and terror with
almost cult-like zealousness.
And they call conspiracy theorists paranoid?
Maybe they should look in the mirror sometime... no well-informed conspiracy
investigator would ever mistake an umbrella for an assault rifle in broad
daylight.
The antidote is
Trickle-Up Liberty
Fortunately, there's a ready solution to all this.
The antidote to
Trickle-Down Tyranny is Trickle-Up Liberty... also known as "grassroots
People power." This is what happens when ordinary, everyday citizens realize
that all government power comes from the People and that government is the
servant of the People, not the other way around.
So they take to the streets and protest.
They
take their money out of the
accounts of globalist banks. They
stop buying GMOs. They
fight against water
fluoride in their local towns. They spread the word about Ron Paul.
Trickle-Up Liberty is so powerful that it will sooner or later overcome
Trickle-Down Tyranny... but only if enough people actually remember what
liberty feels like.
That's why, I urge you to practice liberty in
everything you do. Don't settle for tyranny when you can insist on liberty!
After all, the Bill of Rights guarantees you a number of extremely important
rights, many of which are now being quickly eroded. Stand up for restoring
those rights and you will empower the phenomenon of Trickle-Up Liberty
(grassroots liberty), which is the ultimate solution against Trickle-Down
Tyranny.
You can also defend liberty by practicing common courtesy (and common sense)
in your own positions of power.
-
Don't terrorize people just because you can.
-
Exercise common human decency and compassion for those who deserve your
assistance.
-
When you practice random acts of kindness, you alter the entire
emotional landscape across America, replacing fear with kindness, replacing
terror with confidence.
If corporate CEOs would practice this, then... well, most corporations would
probably go out of business because they're mostly in the business of
screwing people over for a profit.
"There is no such thing as a victimless
billionaire," remember.
That level of wealth accumulation simply doesn't
happen without taking from others in the process.
But remember:
In the end, kindness will always win out over terror.
Spread a
little around, and you'll see what a world of difference it can really make.
And try to remember not to carry black umbrellas around any liberal college
campuses, or you'll quickly find out what trickle-down tyranny really looks
like.
