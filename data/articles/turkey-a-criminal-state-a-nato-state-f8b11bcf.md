# Turkey - A Criminal State, a NATO State

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_middleeast134.htm

Beyond just the war
itself, Turkey has been implicated in a wide variety
of crimes (some constituting war crimes) which cast
Ankara in a very bad light:
-
a supporter of
terrorism
-
a criminal
government engaging in acts of aggression
against its neighbors and other world powers
-
the repression
of journalists and others who have brought
the truth to the light of day,
...among many others.
Taken in total, it
becomes clear that under Recep Tayyip Erdogan
Turkey has become a belligerent actor with delusions
of hegemony and a complete disregard for human
rights and sovereignty.
Cataloguing Turkish Crimes
The criminality of the
Erdogan government can be roughly broken down into
the following categories:
-
aggression
against sovereign states
-
material support
for international terrorism
-
systematic
violation of human rights
Naturally, there are
many other crimes that would also be included in a
full and completing accounting of Ankara's illegal
actions including, but not limited to,
...and many others.
But it is the support
for international terrorism that rises above all
others to thrust Turkey into the spotlight as one of
the single most important supporters of the global
scourge of terrorism.
Turkey's central role in
each and every aspect of terrorism in Syria must be
the starting point of any analysis of Turkey's grave
crimes.
President Erdogan has
not been shy about calling
for regime change in Syria, but his position has
been far more than merely rhetorical; Erdogan's
government has played a very direct role in the
sponsorship, arming, facilitation and military
backing of everyone from the Free Syrian Army to
Jabhat al-Nusra (Al Qaeda in Syria) and the Islamic
State (ISIS/ISIL/Daesh).
In 2012, the New York
Times confirmed that
the CIA was sending weapons and other military
materiel into the hands of anti-Assad forces from
the Turkish side of the border, using their
connections with
the Muslim Brotherhood to do so.
However, it has also
come to light that Turkish intelligence has been
front and center in the ongoing campaign to arm and
resupply the terror groups such as the al-Nusra
Front and others.
This fact was exposed by
Can Dündar, the editor-in-chief of the
Cumhuriyet,
who now faces a potential
life sentence at the behest of President Erdogan,
who himself called for Dündar to receive multiple
life sentences.
What is the reason for
the attack on Dündar and other opposition
journalists?
The
Cumhuriyet, one of
the most widely read Turkish dailies, published
video footage confirming the widespread allegations
that Turkish trucks, ostensibly loaded with
humanitarian supplies, were actually filled with
arms bound for terror groups fighting against Assad,
and that those trucks were operated by Turkey's
National Intelligence Organization (MİT).
But it
goes much further than that....
Turkey has been directly
involved on the ground in Syria both in active
military and support roles.
In fact, transcripts of
wiretaps obtained by Cumhuriyet,
and presented in Turkish courts, along with shocking
video footage (below), have confirmed what numerous
eyewitnesses have stated:
Turkish security
forces have been directly involved in shelling
and support operations for Nusra front and other
jihadi groups in and around Kassab, Syria, among
other sites.
This is a crucial piece
of information because it explains just why those
terror groups were able to successfully capture that
region in 2014, and recapture it this year.
Eyewitnesses in Kassab
have confirmed what Syrian soldiers speaking on
condition of anonymity had reported, namely that
Turkish helicopters and heavy artillery were used in
support of Nusra and the other terror groups during
both the 2014 and the current campaign.
Of course this policy of
alliance with anti-Assad terrorists has been part of
Turkey's modus operandi since the beginning of the
conflict.
In 2012, Reuters revealed that
Turkey,
"set up a secret
base with allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar to
direct vital military and communications aid to
Syria's rebels from a city near the border
'It's the Turks who
are militarily controlling it. Turkey is the
main coordinator/facilitator. Think of a
triangle, with Turkey at the top and Saudi
Arabia and Qatar at the bottom,' said a
Doha-based source."
This information was
confirmed by Vice President Joe Biden in his
spectacular foot-in-mouth speech at Harvard
University where he stated:
Our allies in the
region were our largest problem in Syria. The
Turks were great friends
[and] the Saudis, the
Emirates, etcetera. What were they doing?
They poured hundreds
of millions of dollars and tens of tons of
weapons into anyone who would fight against
Assad - except that the people who were being
supplied, [they] were al-Nusra, and al-Qaeda,
and the extremist elements of jihadis who were
coming from other parts of the world.
But one must guard
against the false notion that somehow Turkey's role
has been merely as auxiliary in Syria, as a
supporter, but not leader, of the terrorist factions
wreaking havoc on the Syrian battlefield.
Instead, it is now an
inescapable fact, even acknowledged by some
high-ranking military and intelligence officials,
that Turkey has been the principal financier and
supporter of the Islamic State and the other
jihadist groups.
According to the UK
Independent, President Erdogan's son
Bilal Erdogan, along with a number of other close
associates, have been directly benefitting from the
illicit oil trade with the Islamic State.
The paper noted that,
"Bilal Erdogan
is
one of three equal partners in the BMZ group, a
major Turkish oil and marine shipping company,
which both the Russian and Syrian governments
have accused of purchasing oil from ISIS
Bilal Erdogan has
been directly involved in the oil trade with
ISIS
Turkey downed a Russian jet on 24 November
specifically to protect his oil smuggling
business."
In fact, Syria's
Information Minister Omran al-Zoabi explained
that,
"All of the oil was
delivered to a company that belongs to the son
of Recep [Tayyip] Erdogan.
This is why Turkey
became anxious when Russia began delivering
airstrikes against the IS infrastructure and
destroyed more than 500 trucks with oil already.
They're importing
not only oil, but wheat and historic artefacts
[sic] as well."
So it seems that Erdogan
and his clique are involved not simply in fomenting
war and terrorism in Syria, but also in its plunder,
with complex smuggling networks being directly tied
to the Turkish President himself.
Indeed, just such
smuggling networks have been uncovered throughout
Asia, tying Turkey into the broader international
architecture of terrorism trafficking.
In late 2014 and early
2015, a human
trafficking ring was exposed by Chinese
authorities. It was revealed that at least ten Turks
were responsible for organizing and facilitating the
border crossings of a number of
Uighurs (Chinese
Muslims from Xinjiang), at least one of whom was a
wanted Uighur terrorist with others being
"radicalized potential terrorists."
These individuals were
likely part of a previously documented trend of
Uighur extremists traveling to the Middle East to
train and fight with the Islamic State and/or other
terror groups.
In fact, precisely this
trend was exposed two months earlier in September
2014 when Reuters reported
that Beijing formally accused militant Uighurs from
Xinjiang of having traveled to Islamic
State-controlled territory to receive training.
Further corroborating
these accusations, the Jakarta Post of Indonesia
reported that four Chinese Uighur jihadists had
been arrested in Indonesia after having travelled
from Xinjiang through Malaysia.
Other similar reports
have also surfaced in recent months, painting a
picture of a concerted campaign to help Uighur
extremists travel throughout Asia, communicating and
collaborating with transnational terror groups such
as IS.
Now, with these latest
revelations regarding Turkish nationals being
involved in the trafficking of extremists, it seems
an invaluable piece of the terrorist transit
infrastructure has been exposed.
Indeed my assertions
above (initially made here in
early February 2015) have been substantiated by
Syria's ambassador to China, quoted at length by
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh
in his piece
Military to Military which notes the following:
[Syria's ambassador
to China Imad Moustapha explained that],
'China regards
the Syrian crisis from three perspectives,'
he said: international law and legitimacy;
global strategic positioning; and the
activities of jihadist Uighurs, from
Xinjiang province in China's far west.
Xinjiang borders
eight nations
and, in China's view, serves as a
funnel for terrorism around the world and within
China.
Many Uighur fighters
now in Syria are known to be members of the East
Turkestan Islamic Movement - an often violent
separatist organization that seeks to establish
an Islamist Uighur state in Xinjiang.
'The fact that
they have been aided by Turkish intelligence
to move from China into Syria through Turkey
has caused a tremendous amount of tension
between the Chinese and Turkish
intelligence,' Moustapha said.
'China is
concerned that the Turkish role of
supporting the Uighur fighters in Syria may
be extended in the future to support
Turkey's agenda in Xinjiang. We are already
providing the Chinese intelligence service
with information regarding these terrorists
and the routes they crossed from on
travelling into Syria'.
Moustapha's concerns
were echoed by a Washington foreign affairs analyst
who has closely followed the passage of jihadists
through Turkey and into Syria.
The analyst, whose views
are routinely sought by senior government officials,
told me that,
'Erdoğan has been
bringing Uighurs into Syria by special transport
while his government has been agitating in favor
of their struggle in China.
Uighur and Burmese
Muslim terrorists who escape into Thailand
somehow get Turkish passports and are then flown
to Turkey for transit into Syria.'
He added that there was
also what amounted to another 'rat line' that was
funnelling Uighurs - estimates range from a few
hundred to many thousands over the years - from
China into Kazakhstan for eventual relay to Turkey,
and then to IS territory in Syria.
'US intelligence,'
he said, 'is not getting good information about
these activities because those insiders who are
unhappy with the policy are not talking to
them.'
He also said it was 'not
clear' that the officials responsible for Syrian
policy in the State Department and White House 'get
it'.
IHS-Jane's Defence
Weekly estimated in October that as many as five
thousand Uighur would-be fighters have arrived in
Turkey since 2013, with perhaps two thousand moving
on to Syria.
Moustapha said he has information that,
'up to 860 Uighur fighters are currently in Syria.'
It has become clear that
Turkey is now unmistakably a major supporter of
international terrorism, with Syria being merely the
proving ground for a stable of terror groups
directly or indirectly working with Erdogan's
government.
This is further evidenced by the now
documented and verified fact that the Erdogan
government was directly involved in the transfer of
chemical weapons into the hands of ISIS.
As Turkish MP Eren Erdem explained before
the Turkish parliament and to international media,
"There is data in
this indictment. Chemical weapon materials are
being brought to Turkey and being put together
in Syria in camps of ISIS which was known as
Iraqi Al Qaeda during that time."
Erdem noted that
according to an investigation launched (and abruptly
closed) by the General Prosecutor's Office in Adana,
Turkish citizens with ties to the intelligence
community took part in negotiations with ISIS-linked
and Al-Qaeda-linked militants to sell sarin gas for
use in Syria.
The evidence of these
allegations came in the form of wiretapped phone
conversations similar to those published earlier
this year by Cumhuriyet.
Taken in total, the case
against Erdogan's government is damning. At the same
time, one must also note Erdogan's grave crimes
against his own people.
As noted already, Can
Dündar and his colleagues at Cumhuriyet have been
targeted by Erdogan's state for their disclosure of
Ankara's dealings with the terrorists of Syria.
Just a few weeks ago
Dündar, along with Cumhuriyet's Ankara bureau chief
Erdem Gul, were charged in
a Turkish court with "spying" and "divulging state
secrets."
This should not come as
a surprise to anyone familiar with Turkey's track
record when it comes to opposition journalism.
In fact, in December
2014, the Turkish police raided
the offices of the Zaman newspaper, one of the
most popular in the country, alleging that Zaman was
responsible for "launching an armed terror
organization."
The authorities detained
the Zaman Editor-in-Chief Ekrem Dumanlı, as well as
the head of the Samanyolu Media Group, Hidayet
Karaca, along with a producer, scriptwriter and
director.
The Turkish Journalists
Association (TGC) and the Turkey Journalists' Labor
Union (TGS) released a joint
statement in condemnation of the raids and the
ongoing repression of journalists by the Erdogan
government, noting that,
"Almost 200
journalists were previously held in prison on
charges of being a member of a terror
organization, violating their right to a fair
trial. Journalists are now being detained once
again.
These developments
mean that freedom of the press and opinion is
punished in Turkey, which takes its place in the
class of countries where the press is not free."
International
organizations too expressed their outrage at this
blatant violation of freedom of the press.
The International
Federation of Journalists (IFJ), and its regional
group the European Federation of Journalists (EFL),
stated that,
"We are appalled by
this brazen assault on press freedom and Turkish
democracy
One year after the
exposure of corruption at the heart of
government, the authorities appear to be
exacting their revenge by targeting those who
express opposing views
This latest act
demonstrates that the authorities' contempt for
journalism has not diminished."
Of course, Ankara's war
on freedom of speech, and the media generally, is
not relegated to established media outlets such as
Zaman and Cumhuriyet, but also to citizen media and
social media as well.
In response to the
leaking of recordings on Twitter documenting
corruption among Erdogan cronies and political
elites within his Justice and Development Party (AKP),
Erdogan attacked the social media platform, and his
government immediately moved to restrict
access to Twitter.
Erdogan even went so far
as to suggest a total ban on all social media sites,
including Facebook and YouTube, saying that,
"The international
community can say this, can say that. I don't
care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the
Republic of Turkey is."
This sort of
megalomaniacal rhetoric has become the norm for Erdogan, who sees himself as less a president and
more a sultan or absolute monarch.
The famous words of the
International Military Tribunal at Nuremburg
succinctly and matter-of-factly state that the
waging of aggressive war is,
"essentially an evil
thing
to initiate a war of aggression
is not
only an international crime; it is the supreme
international crime, differing only from other
war crimes in that it contains within itself the
accumulated evil of the whole."
This is undeniably true.
But,
-
What happens
when one is engaged in an international
campaign to destroy a neighboring country
through war?
-
What happens
when one country enables and participates in
the destruction of another?
-
What happens
when one country will stop at nothing to
come out victorious in a war it is not
officially involved in, but covertly
manages, and from which it directly
benefits?
-
Are these not
simply different forms of the same crime,
the supreme crime, as it were?
Let's face it, Turkey is
now a mafia state ruled by a criminal regime. It is
also a NATO member state.
Perhaps now the
pernicious illusion of NATO as military alliance
'defending' justice, human rights, and
the rule of law
can finally be put to rest.
While the propagandists
will continue the charade, Turkey has permanently
exposed the US-NATO-GCC-Israel for the warmongers
they are in Syria and around the world.
Let's just
hope the world notices...
