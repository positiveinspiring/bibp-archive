# A Battleground for Weapons of The Future

More than a week after a U.S.-Egyptian
brokered ceasefire brought a fragile peace to Gaza, military analysts
are busily assessing the fighting between Israel and Hamas.
Their goal: Apply lessons from the eight-day
battle to weaponry still in development.
Israels frequent conflicts with its Arab
neighbors have historically been proving grounds for the latest in
battlefield technology. Arab-Israeli wars inspired the first operational
aerial drones, radar-evading stealth warplanes and projectile-defeating
armor. All are now staples of the worlds leading militaries.
Analysts now say this recent fighting could
spur the proliferation of highly accurate, fast-firing defenses against
rocket barrages, a threat that has long flummoxed military planners.
The solution could be inspired by Israels
now-famous Iron Dome, a rocket-intercepting missile system that shot
down hundreds of Hamas rockets before they could strike Israeli
settlements.
Following the campaign, other nations
are expressing interest in this capability, says Tamir Eshel,
editor of the Website, Defense Update, who is also an Israeli
defense consultant.
The United States, however, has balked at
the expense of using missiles to shoot down missiles.
The Defense Department could copy Israels
rocket-defense strategy but with a potentially cheaper twist: directed
energy weapons, based on lasers.
Both the Israelis and the U.S., said
George Lewis, a senior research associate in the Peace Studies
Program at Cornell University, have considered lasers for these
kinds of systems, and the U.S. is still developing them. Theyre
just not quite there yet.
The recent combat in Gaza, however, could
help push the technology forward. Its happened before.
Consider, in six days of furious fighting in
1967, Israeli troops captured territory from Egypt, Jordan and Syria,
massively expanding the border of the tiny Jewish state. Seven years
later on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, Arab forces attacked.
The 1973 Yom Kippur war was a shock for the
once technologically superior Israeli forces. Soviet-supplied missiles
took a heavy toll on Israeli tanks and warplanes.
The SA-6 surface-to-air missile was
particularly devastating.
The SA-6 would fly out parallel to the
desert floor then pitch up at you, explained Barry Watts, a former
Air Force officer now with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments, a Washington policy organization, and it didnt have a
smoke trail. The Israelis lost a lot of airplanes to it.
The U.S. Defense Science Board conducted a
study of the 73 war and concluded that in any future conflict, American
planes would,
have a real challenge getting though
air defenses.
The board recommended development of a new
kind of bomber that would evade the SA-6, by being essentially invisible
to its supporting radar.
The result was the Lockheed F-117, the
worlds first stealth aircraft.
The Yom Kippur War was the major
inspiration, said Bill Sweetman, author of Lockheed Stealth and
Ultimate Fighter: Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.
Today the Air Force is attempting, at great
cost, to build a frontline fleet composed almost entirely of stealth
fighters and bombers - including the F-22, the F-35, the B-2 and the new
Long Range Strike Bomber still on the drawing board.
Russia, China and Japan are also designing
stealth warplanes.
Other radical new weapon systems that
emerged from the Yom Kippur War include special reactive vehicle armor
that explodes outward, destroying incoming projectiles. That armor,
along with other Israeli-designed vehicle protection, is now standard on
the most popular American- and Russian-made ground vehicles.
The first combat-grade Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles, or drones, were also rapidly designed by Israeli munitions
manufacturers in order to avoid exposing reconnaissance pilots to enemy
defenses, as happened in 73.
The 10-foot-long Mastiff drone was unpopular
- until thoroughly proven in tests.
Air force and army intelligence adopted
it with much enthusiasm, Eshel recalls. The Americans bought
upgraded versions that are still in use today.
In the late 70s, Abraham Karem, one
of Israels leading drone inventors, immigrated to California, hoping to
tap the much larger U.S. weapons market.
Using his home as a workshop, he produced
the first prototype of what would become todays General Atomics
Predator and Reaper drones, perhaps the major weapons in Americas
global counter-terrorism campaign.
Inside the Dome
Some analysts expect Israels Iron Dome
rocket defense to have an equally profound impact on weapons
development.
Each Rafael-built Iron Dome system consists
of a radar and three reloadable packs of 20 missiles, plus a command
trailer. The radar, a sophisticated model designed by Elta, detects
incoming rockets and other low-altitude projectiles and cues a
maneuverable missile to intercept.
Iron Dome was developed by Israel, with some
U.S. funding, after the 2006 Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon.
Israel was defenseless against massive
Hezbollah rocket fire, Michael Oren, Israels ambassador to the
United States, wrote in the newsletter, Israel Hayom.
A year later, Hamas rocket-fire on
southern Israeli communities intensified and the need arose to
develop a system to defend against short-range missiles.
Eight Iron Dome systems have now been
funded.
Two were deployed in 2011. An Israeli
official told Eshel that Hamas fired approximately 1,500 rockets during
the recent fighting, of which 146 misfired or fell inside Gaza and 875
exploded in unoccupied areas. Iron Dome intercepted 421. Just 58 rockets
penetrated the defenses and fell in populated areas.
Six Israelis died and hundreds were injured,
according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
U.S. analysts have been watching and
listening. Since the beginning of the Iraq War the Pentagon has looked
for ways to defend against intensive rocket strikes.
As a stopgap, the military modified
fast-firing naval guns for ground use. In the United States, however,
purpose-designed defenses like Iron Dome have failed to get past the
prototype stage.
People have been pointing to Iron
Dome, said David Wright, a missile-defense expert at the Union of
Concerned Scientists, and saying it seems to show that kind of
stuff can work.
But many are concerned about the high cost.
Cornells Lewis estimates Hamas rockets
cost at most $50,000 apiece. Each Iron Dome missile costs up to $90,000,
according to a March report from the Congressional Research Service.
We assumed the missile approach to be
too expensive, said Lewis of Cornell University. Its astonishing
that the Israelis are doing this with missiles.
The U.S. has tinkered with solid-state
lasers as a rocket defense thats cheaper per shot fired - just a few
dollars per blast, for some models.
But Watts, of the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments, notes that funding for the Pentagons short-range
laser development has been declining for several years, and is now a
minimal $90 million in the most recent budget.
The U.S. military, Watts said, is
just not serious about really reaching critical mass in
directed-energy technology.
Not for a lack of options: Defense giant
Lockheed Martin this week announced the first successful test of its
Area Defense Anti-Munitions system, a 10-kilowatt laser meant for
shooting down rockets, other munitions and enemy drones.
Directed-energy stuff, Watts said of
these new laser weapons, we ought to be pushing it, and the fact is
were not.
But Israels experience shooting down
hundreds of rockets - and saving perhaps hundreds of lives - could
redirect U.S. technology efforts.
Even if it comes at great expense.
It should, said Watts, have an impact
on what were doing.
