World Currency
The US Empire is not the
Money Power.
China's rise and opposition to the US
fits the familiar pattern:
the Money Power's proxies
working towards managed conflict and
World Government.
To many it is unclear whether China
is incorporated in the
New World Order or a real competitor to
Anglo-American Imperialism.
There is little doubt that the Money Power co-opted the leadership of the
Land of the Dragon a long time ago. History shows that the Money Power has
several tools to motivate peoples in the right direction.
Their fingerprints
are all over China.
In his
excellent analysis of the power brokers in China, St. John
Bartholomew reminds us that Marxism is a Money Power operation and that
Mao did their bidding. Mao was apparently educated at Yale's department in
China. Yale's
Skull and Bones were very active in Asia and Mao was
probably a member.
Most American diplomats sent to him were so too.
According to Bartholomew, the triads, China's mafia-style secret societies,
were built up by Masons to combat the Qing dynasty that ruled China until
the 19th century and resisted the Opium the British needed to sell to China
because they had nothing else to exchange for its vast riches.
The membership list of
the Trilateral Commission,
the Rockefeller confab similar to
the Atlantic Bilderbergers, is littered
with
Chinese names.

MONEY SUPPLY
Another indicator is China's money supply.
The Chinese Government officially owns the money
supply. It is not entirely clear where the interest goes.
However, the Government is under control of the Money Power, so the added
value, which is the essence, goes to them. It serves their purpose. The
Government also can (and does) create the boom bust cycle the Money Power
wants. The Emperors printed debt-free cash.
The Chinese are moving to back the Yuan by Gold, clearly promoting the Money
Power's nascent Gold Standard.
Meanwhile, its Central Bank President, Zhao Xiaochuan, who is a member of
the Group of 30,
the
Rockefeller-sponsored group of leading Central Bankers and academics, is
calling for World Currency.
As we have seen, opposition against the dollar is not the same thing as
opposition against the Money Power.
China is a loyal member of all the international governance organizations.
Furthermore, over the last decades the Money Power has migrated a
substantial part of its manufacturing base from Europe and particularly the
US to China.
Can there be any doubt that they would be very,
very sure that that crucial strategic asset would be absolutely safe there?
CHINA'S RISE AND ITS
IMPLICATIONS
The build up of China must be seen in light of the decades-old program of
the de-industrialization of the West, particularly America. What has been
given to China, was taken from elsewhere.
Also, this build up is actually a typical M.O.:
think of how US technology and money built
up the USSR to create a credible 'threat' in the Cold War.
Saddam Hussein is another example:
he was made strong to be taken down later as
part of the strategy to conquer the Middle East.
Or Iran, which is bolstered by often
Western/Israeli technology that is transferred via China.
China's rise comes with many dangers. Chinese
nationalism is primitive and easily inflamed. Beijing is under incredible
pressure internally and happily uses external 'foes' to export these
pressures. The latest rows with Japan over some trivial islands are a case
in point.
Just like the Money Power conducted the European Orchestra during the 19th
century, it now directs a Multi-Polar World.
We know how it all ended in Europe:
tightly knit alliances facing each other
with ever more paranoia, unable to extricate themselves from the trap. One
assassination was enough to light the fuse.
The same can be seen today, with NATO facing
the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization of Russia and China, with Pakistan and
Iran as close associates.
CONCLUSION
China is being built up in a very typical fashion.
All the pointers that we
have come to recognize are there:
The
US Empire is not the Money Power.
China's rise and opposition to the US
fits the familiar pattern: the Money Power's proxies working towards managed
conflict and World Government.
