In the Defense Advance Research Project Agency's
(DARPA) new budget, which was just recently unveiled, some startling
technologies have been included for increased research and development.
The most glaring of these is the $4 million to be spent on technologies
which will supposedly,
manage the adversarys sensory perception in an
attempt to confuse, delay, inhibit, or misdirect [the targets] actions.
While the idea is quite creative and seemingly the stuff of science fiction,
the name chosen is a bit more straight forward: Battlefield Illusion.
In elucidating the goals of the project, DARPA writes,
The current
operational art of human-sensory battlefield deception is largely an ad-hoc
practice, leading the agency to attempt to better grasp how humans use
their brains to process sensory inputs, in order to create multi-sensory
hallucinations which could provide tactical advantage to our forces,
according to Danger Room.
DARPAs budget request for the Fiscal Year of 2013 includes a whopping $2.82
billion in spending - all of which we dont have and thus will just serve to
sink the United States further into the black hole of debt - and even
includes increased spending on the Collaborative Hypersonic Research (CHR)
program which is intended to demonstrate the capability of a boost-glide
vehicle as the predecessor to a tactical strike weapon capable of long-range
attacks from a 21-inch or larger booster.
The
American military establishments love affair with so-called
psychotronic weaponry has been a long and complicated one, largely hidden
from public scrutiny.
Some of the most infamous examples of these types of projects are the
so-called Voice of God weapon which was designed in an attempt to transmit
what might be confused with the voice of God into the heads of insurgents in
order to make them choose to lay down arms.
The information on this project has been quite thin, and many claim it never
left the laboratory, although the fact that this technology has been in
development since the 1990s makes me think that this might actually be more
advanced than we are being told.
For those unfamiliar with this type of technology, I highly recommend doing
your own research before jumping to any conclusions as to the capabilities
(or lack of capabilities) inherent in this type of psychotronic weaponry.
A good resource which covers many different incarnations of this technology
across both declassified government and commercial applications can be
found
here and other resources on
psychotronic weaponry.
One project we know about is the Armys Mob Excess Deterrent Using Silent
Audio, or
MEDUSA. This project utilized microwaves to make the target
believe that the projected audio was actually coming from inside their own
head.
As
New Scientist reported in 2008, the technology is actually capable of
projecting a microwave beam which creates sound so loud that it actually
can incapacitate the target or cause severe discomfort.
Furthermore, since the sound does not actually enter through the eardrums
like normal auditory stimuli, there are no audio safety limits as there
would be normally.
Lev Sadovnik of the United States Sierra Nevada Corporation worked on the
system and said,
The repel effect is a combination of loudness and the
irritation factor. You cant block it out.
The
Phase I summary report released by the U.S. Navy indicated that the
program was indeed successful, but for some reason Noah Schachtman
writes
for Danger Room,
Neither program [referring to the MEDUSA and the Voice of
God program], as far as I know, ever left the laboratory.
However, I must point out that it is quite arrogant and ignorant of
Schachtman to think that his lack of knowledge concerning the projects being
used in the field says anything about if the devices were or are going to be
used.
As I discussed in the first episode of End the Lie Radio, during which we
explored some excerpts from Nick Begichs Earth Rising: the Revolution,
Toward a Thousand Years of Peace, this technology is not something which
has just cropped up in the last few years, indeed it has been in the works
for over a decade.
You can listen to the episode via YouTube below:
What the public knows in regards to classified, highly advanced military
technology is minimal at best.
For evidence of this, all we have to do is
look at projects like the
Manhattan Project,
Project MKULTRA (about which we
still know very little), and
the SR-71 Blackbird
which was first used in
the U.S. Air Force in the 1960s.
Battlefield Illusion is not alone among the mind-bending projects DARPA is
spending our money on. Indeed they have several new programs intended to
manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum for military purposes including the
$3.5 million Electro-Optical Warfare project which will attempt to find
ways to disrupt laser-based communications and sensors.
The American public (which is obviously footing the bill for these projects)
often never is even made aware of their existence for decades after their
inception. I, for one, find this to be quite troubling and frustrating
seeing as our government thinks we do not have a right to know where our
money is going, especially when the technology can be used against us.
Given the government of the United States propensity for
repurposing
military technology for use domestically against civilians, I see no reason
to believe that technology like these battlefield illusions would not be
used against us.
All we can do is hope that the costs for these technologies remain
sufficiently prohibitive in order to keep the government from widely using
this technology, as theyre going to be able to do with the
$50 spy computer
known as the F-BOMB, also funded by DARPA.
I just find it somewhat insane to think that with the total lack of funds
available and the disastrous state of the economy in the United States and
around the globe, our government is spending money on mind control instead
of housing and feeding impoverished Americans.
Unless the American people stand up and start demanding that our needs be
met with the immense amount of money we pour into the government (most of
which ends up in the hands of the
criminal banksters and
war profiteers), we
can expect to see this type of frivolous spending continue indefinitely.
