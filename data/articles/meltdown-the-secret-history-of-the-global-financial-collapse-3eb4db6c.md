Doc Zone has
traveled the world - from Wall Street to Dubai to China - to investigate The
Secret History of the Global Financial Collapse.
Meltdown is the story of
the bankers who crashed the world, the leaders who struggled to save it and
the ordinary families who got crushed.
September 2008 launched an extraordinary chain of events:
-
General Motors,
the worlds largest company, went bust
-
Washington Mutual became the worlds
largest bank failure
-
Lehman Brothers became the worlds largest bankruptcy
ever
The damage quickly spread around the world, shattering global
confidence in the fundamental structures of the international economy.
Meltdown also tells the stories of desperate foreclosed homeowners in
California, disillusioned autoworkers at the end of the line in Ontario and
furious workers in France who shocked the world by kidnapping their own
bosses.
-
The Men Who Crashed the World.
Greed and
recklessness by the titans of Wall Street triggers the largest
financial crash since the Great Depression. Its left to US Treasury
Secretary Hank Paulson, himself a former Wall Street banker, to try
and avert further disaster.
-
A Global Tsunami
The meltdowns
devastation ripples around the world from California to Iceland and
China. Facing economic ruin, desperate world leaders are at each
others throats.
-
Paying the Price
The victims of the
meltdown fight back. In Iceland, protesters force a government to
fall. In Canada, ripped off autoworkers occupy their plant. And in
France, furious union members kidnap their bosses.
-
After the Fall
Investigators begin to
sift through the meltdowns rubble. Shaken world leaders question
the very foundations of modern capitalism while asking: could it all
happen again?
