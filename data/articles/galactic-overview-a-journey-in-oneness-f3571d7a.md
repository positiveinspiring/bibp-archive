"GALACTIC OVERVIEW"
A Journey into Oneness
Imagine the Universe as one giant living information Being.
Well Aware of Itself.
Imagine that someone interprets, reads and transmits this information.
"To heal a situation it must first
be exposed
Once exposed it must be healed.
This is the purpose of this document.
As a contribution to heal the exposed.
Not by the means of a violent confrontation,
but by the means of a peaceful reconciliation."
" The Principle or Law of Reconciliation is that which finds in differing
qualities unifying similarities that allows these differences to be brought
together; to accept the unifying qualities and diminish the differences, so
that the differences in the qualities become less clashing and conflicting and
the unifying qualities become more binding. This is to reconcile, to find common
denominators in things that are normally seen as separative, and to emphasize
and exaggerate and promote those common denominators, thus allowing the differences
to fade away, or fall into proper alignment. The Law Of Reconciliation allows
those things which are normally in conflict to become harmonious in relationship
to one another"

TAPPING INTO THE UNIVERSAL MIND OF THE LIVING GOD
Celestial Awareness is that Universal Force or Celestial Consciousness that
manifests Itself as Universal Consciousness in ultra-high levels of frequency.
Its expressions are given to those who attune to those frequencies as impressions
and symbols which are then interpreted by a translator, such as Paul Shockley,
who has interpreted its messages since 1969. The beautiful wisdom and highly
practical common sense brought through from Celestial Awareness about human
consciousness and world affairs, has enthralled hundreds of thousands of readers
worldwide since 1963.
Cosmic Awareness is the force that expressed Itself through Edgar Cayce, Christ,
the Buddha, Krisna, Mohammed, and other great Avatars who served as "channels"
for our Father/Mother God, and who speaks again today as the world begins to
enter the New Age of spiritual consciousness and awareness. Since 1963 Cosmic
Awareness has been communicating through carefully trained channels.
The information contained herein was received from deep trance states and "interpreted"
by an entity affiliated with Cosmic Awareness Communications. (C.A.C.)
Awareness tells you not to believe anything, but to question, explore, doubt and discover for yourself what is the truth. Cosmic Awareness only indicates and suggests.
The 3 major Players in the Galaxy
This Awareness wishes entities to understand that there are
three major players
in the galaxy:
the Reptoid Federation
the Galactic Confederation
the Orion Empire
The Orion Empire as that which is ruled basically by one leader, as presented fictionally in the story of Star Wars . The Reptoid Federation, as that which is a conglomeration of many different groups, in which the Reptoids in various types of species have joined together and the Galactic Confederation as that which is made up from federations of different star systems throughout the galaxy, these being most of human types. (Pleiadians, Vega, Sirius, Arcturius, Lyrans, Andromeda and more.)
(Revelations Awareness issue 91-16/NO. 391)
New World Order
(New World Order Another Form of Communism)
This Awareness indicates that essentially,
the New World Order is just
another
form of Communism being imposed on the world. This Awareness does not mean this
in a way that sounds like some right-wing fanatic, but it must be understood
that Communism began with payments from certain bankers to Trotsky to train
troops in New York, and money was sent to Lenin to fight in Russia, and these
were efforts to create a Communist state in Russia.
The Communist state in Russia was allowed to continue until recently, and while
it is said that it failed of its own nature, and fell apart, this Awareness
suggests that also it was part of a long-term New World Order plan, and the
same people who financed it in 1917, or their heirs, are financing the New World
Order and pushing for its imposition on the rest of the world, and it will be
much like, and follow the same patterns that were used in taking over Russia.
The Progressive Steps to Taken Over the Country
(USA and the World ed.)
This Awareness indicates the first thing is to take away the arms of the people
so that they are unarmed.
Next is to take away any means of organizing and communicating so that they
cannot form groups, or large armies. The next thing is to make them vulnerable.
If they are homeless, or if they are without food, they are subject to mass
control and manipulation. The next thing is to get rid of the opinion makers,
the leaders, the Christians; the Christians because they have certain principles
and beliefs and values that they do not wish to compromise; and patriots, and
by getting rid of patriots, they will have eliminated any major resistance to
the New World Order and they will be able to tell the remaining people what
to do and they will do it.
Many will do it for reward, others will do it to avoid punishment. This Awareness
indicates therefore, your only time to do anything is prior to the take over
date, and the only thing you can do is alert the masses, attempt to persuade
the police to stand by their allegiance to the Constitution, to the values of
the country and to the protection of the people against these foreigners and
Communists, these people who would destroy this country in order to rule the
world for themselves.
It is simply an old game played with new methods of someone trying to rule the
world, because he or she or they are so ambitious and have so little respect
for others, and they are so wealthy that they can buy or frighten or destroy
any who interfere with their plans to rule the world, and the question you may
wish to ask is:
"Are you going to commit treason or are you going to abide by the law of the land and your allegiance to the Constitution and the country you have sworn to uphold?"
This Awareness indicates there could be an ironic twist, whereby the people
who promote the New World Order may themselves in the end find themselves in
the concentration camp that they had set up for the masses of patriots and Christians.
This Awareness indicates that it is an idea that could cause them to ponder
on their future fate, if this idea were also spread.
This Awareness suggests that entities need to communicate with police, with
the army, with all the military, with those leaders in Congress and the Senate,
with community leaders, church leaders, and with any who might have influence
over others, including the media, and the entertainment fields This Awareness
indicates the more entities who are contacted, the more who will switch their
allegiance to represent the people and the country to which they belong.
(Revelations Awareness 93-12/NO. 421)
A Mathematical Formula
for Enslaving the Masses
This Awareness wishes you to know that these masters of economics are not operating
without a map; that these entities have a precise, almost mathematical formula
for enslaving the masses. Those experiences of the past, such as sugar rationing,
the gasoline shortage, the cafe shortage, other similar crisis in commodities
and in the political and military events that have happened over the past two
decades,-these things were not haphazard. This did not simply happen because
someone overestimated something or because bad weather affected the crops or
because some event happened.
These were manufactured in order to get a computer readout of how the masses
would respond to such crises, and from these readouts, in a kind of linear programming,
they could take this information, put it in a formula and make predictions as
to how the masses will behave, and as to what degree they can influence the
masses without the masses turning against them, and this kind of computerized
programming perfected to such a degree that it is almost mathematical, almost
as any mathematical formula in its predictive outcome. They know exactly what
kind of crisis to create in order to get the public to do this or that. (Revelations
Awareness 88-8/NO. 329)
New World Order Sneaking
in Like a Thief in the Night
It wishes at this time to inform entities that this so-called
New World Order is likely to come about in a manner that is unobtrusive and
without a great clarity or understanding as to what it is, in such a manner
that it is upon you before you realize it's there, so that there is very little
disturbance to society.
When the society realizes that the sovereign nation is not
longer sovereign but is subservient to
the United Nations and that the United
Nations is the center for the New World Order and that national laws are subject
to united, national laws and the laws of the New World Order, it will be too
late.
This Awareness indicates that for the first decades of this New World Order
being in place, it is not likely that entities will feel the yoke of oppression
that is possible under the new laws, but as time progresses, the new laws of
the New World Order, being put in place, will be activated slowly and tightened
slowly, until the future generations discover themselves under laws that may
have total disregard for the rights that entities presently enjoy, especially
those in the United States under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
This Awareness indicates that before any of this takes place, the handguns and
rifles will be confiscated from the public and the people, being disarmed, will
have no recourse but to surrender to whatever tyranny raises to replace the
democracies that entities presently enjoy.
New World Order is also
an Economic Machine
This Awareness indicates that the New World Order is that which is more
than a political machine; it is also an economic machine which is capable of
determining the life-style of your children and your children's children, and
once it is in place, whatever form it is capable of providing may be difficult
to alter; that already it is more or less in effect but it is not fully implemented.
It is like having a power system in a building that still needs the switch thrown,
though most of the wiring has been placed and is in some cases operational,
and in some cases in operation,
Once the switch is thrown, may of the mechanism of the New World Order may be
seen to have long been in place and the bureaucracy of the New World Order will
then be able to deal as it chooses, as its leaders chooses. This Awareness indicates
the likelihood is that there will be a leveling out of income and life-styles
in which the middle class and upper class will be reduced to a common lower
class , and the ultra wealthy who are in charge of the New World Order.
This may not take immediately, but gradually, moving in that direction by manipulating
of the economies and nations. This Awareness indicates that the tightening of
the medical controls, controls on business, controls on individuals, controls
that prevent entities for being able to sue or claim rights and privileges that
have been available for entities as recourses for needs and broken promises
or violations, are gradually being eroded. Individuals who can no longer get
the support needed to confront the amalgamations of powerful organizations and
government agencies, are finding it more and more difficult to claim their rights.
It is even questionable whether some of the guaranteed rights are worth trying
to enforce or trying to claim because the cost is prohibitive and can destroy
an entity's entire financial base in the pursuit of its right. This Awareness
indicates that this becoming more and more pronounced as time passes. There
may become a time when you can not even discuss health matters with each other
or possible alleviation of health problems without being arrested, if overheard,
for practicing medicine without a license.

The Mindset of the
Internationalists;
The Law of Leverage May Save
the Day
This Awareness indicates that energies have been put in
motion which appear to be those that will help to bring about considerable clarity;
that this is not to be underestimated. It is no small thing. This Awareness
indicates that the continued movement in this direction as that which may be
of great value to this plane; that it relates to the Law of Leverage
wherein a small amount of energy, applied at the right time, in the right place,
in the right way, can move huge amounts of energy, which might not be available
at a later time, or from another way. The timing is most important as it relates
to the timing. The means is only available at the right times.
(Revelations
Awareness 92-13/NO. 405)
A Cosmic View of How Reptoids are Created
This Awareness wishes to proceed to another step or level of understanding
the present situation. This Awareness indicates that from a cosmic point of
view, all entities are aspects of this Awareness, whether they be alien to earth,
or inhabitants of earth, or whether they be from other planets or systems, or
other planes of existence; all are aspects of the Universal Consciousness, a
consciousness that resides throughout the universe in all things.
This Awareness indicates that when consciousness began to divide and fragment,
each fragment took on its own unique appearance. Many of these fragments then
divided further and created multitudes of fragmented beings similar to each
other. Other fragments of the original group divided into multiple fragments,
creating multitudes of other beings, having different features, different from
the first fragmented group. For example, those of the Reptilian types and those
of the human types came from different fragments of consciousness. This Awareness
indicates that in the sense of polarity, such as a line of a magnet or magnetic
bar, the positive pole on one end and the negative pole on the other end; if
this bar were made of light or consciousness, and one end of that bar were to
develop faster than the other end, the faster growing end would become the head,
the other end the tail.
Now, if the positive end of the bar became the head, it would result in a creature
different from the bar in which the negative end became the head. This Awareness
is speaking in terms of molecule levels, also in terms of galactic and stellar
levels and in terms of universal levels; that whatever creature is created it
has a positive and a negative side, and one side is energized more than the
other. The positive side, if energized more, becomes the head, and the negative
side, if energized more, becomes the head.
The Reptoids were born out of the negative end of such polarized energy, and
the mammals were born out of the positive side of such energies, and they are,
of course, many degrees in between. Thus, you see the cat with its cats eyes
having certain qualities similar to that of the Reptoids and Greys and the dog
with its round eyes and round pupils having certain qualities and facial features
more akin to that of the human.
Of course, the monkeys and anthropoid types are even closer to human shapes
and forms and, of course, the serpents and reptiles are closer to the Reptoid
forms and shapes. This Awareness indicates that many entities have been conditioned
to believe that man evolved out of the animal; that the energies of evolution
coming up from the animal led to the creation of mankind, of humankind. This
Awareness suggests that essentially, it was the opposite; that out of consciousness
came rays of energy, split and divided like that from a prism, wherein light
broke into various colors and light itself carrying consciousness, unique to
its own vibration and color, than again began to split, created still further
aspects of being, which again split, carrying further aspects of being, which
aspects again split and continued ad infinitum.
This Awareness indicates that the animals essentially are cast off from the
consciousness of humans and other higher creatures, and are splits in consciousness
that occurred as this big bang of consciousness occurred, creating all the reflections
moving down into greater and greater fragmentation. Thus, the Creators, the
Creator was the consciousness, but the gods that took on form were partly the
next aspect of that Creator and subsequently came the plants and animals that
followed as consciousness splintered and fragmented further.
Darwin's Theory is Backwards
This Awareness indicates that the Darwin's theory that it all started out "here"
somewhere, with multitudes of atoms combining into molecules, combining into
living cells, splitting and become larger celled creatures, eventually evolving
into small amoeba and further evolved creatures, is simply backwards of the
actual creation. This Awareness indicates the humanoid type creations occurred
close to the beginning, even before there were plants, but these creations did
not move into form, in the density levels of physical form, until quite some
time later, after the big bang of consciousness, wherein a cooling process took
place, in the sense that the vibrations slowed down sufficiently to create a
flux of energy that can be classed as physical form.
(Revelations Awareness 90-18/NO. 371)
The Value of Humanity
The value of humanity is not in what humanity has done, but in its potential,
yet unknown, for humanity's potential is on the brink of expressing itself,
and, if surviving, will soon reach a state of expression that will be as the
expression of divinity. It will be associated with angelic powers. It is only
a matter of time. The difference between humanity and the Reptilian or Reptoid
types is that humanity is accompanied by the evolutionary growth and development
of compassion, while the Reptoids have stripped away compassion from their being
and have become technologically cold, efficient, powerful.
Reptoids are Spiritually Bankrupt Beings
They have great power. They have great technology. They are extremely efficient
in what they do, but they lack compassion. They do not care for others, even
among their own rank in the way that humans care. This Awareness indicates that
they are spiritually bankrupt, whereas humans are on the brink of spiritual
abundance. It is so close, and when it comes, human powers will excel and exceed
the technologies available to those Reptoids, for the spiritual powers will
allow humans with their mentality and consciousness to have domination over
those technological powers of the Reptoids.
This Awareness indicates it is not such a matter of good or evil, it is a matter
of returning to the source, to the original consciousness from whence all came,
and the Reptoids are at the extreme opposite end and have no direction to go
except to return, and the humans are now close to Cosmic Consciousness. It will
be but a matter of time before humans, in collective consciousness, can have
greater power without touching the Reptoids have with all of their technologies.
(Revelations Awareness 91-16/NO.391)
Why Reptoids and Sirians have legitimate claims to human race
The Sirians were masters of genetic engineering and as mentioned in the Sitchin books The Earth Chronicles, helped to bring about the creation of the Cro-Magnon man through these genetic engineering experiments, much earlier in the history of mankind, using genetic engineering from mammals mixed with the earlier genetic mutation brought on by the Dragon, or Draco Reptoids along with their engineering of the Neanderthal types.
That by adding the engineering of the mammalian brain over the Reptoid brain, the Sirians managed to create a more evolved humanoid; the Cro-Magnon or upright man, this known as the Homo Erectus, or Erect Human. It is for this reason that both have legitimate claims to the human race and to the ownership of the Earth, at least legitimate in terms of argument.
They each feel some legitimacy to their claims. Of course,
the humans, for the most part, would prefer their Sirian cousins over the Reptoid
cousins or grandfathers, but there is a claim by Reptoid creatures for their
argument that they were the original creators of humans, although their creation
was intended for the purpose of enslaving the creature for work in mines and
in the field for the gold, and the Sirian action was that which disrupted their
enslavement plans for the creation and it altered the nature of the humanoid
so that the humanoid could evolve and have similar qualities of thought to those
who were by those humanoids considered as gods.
the Reptoids date a claim back some ten thousand years
the Sirius groups claim to have taken control from the Reptoids
the Pleiadians claim spiritual connections with humanity
the Vegans see the earth as not theirs but as an ally to which they wish to assist and join the struggle against tyrannies from other extraterrestrial cultures
This Awareness indicates the
Orion Greys, the tall big nosed Greys, are those
who claim some kind of ownership based on their having placed a computer in
the subterranean levels of earth which has guided energies on earth through
grid-lines and through certain forces that were used through these grid-lines
and through their economic controls that have been handed down over the hundred
and thousands of years that time, up till the present
The Orion Greys appear to be in a position of economic power, wherein they are
more powerful economically, and thus hold control over other extraterrestrials,
such as the Draconians and the Zeta Reptilians. This Awareness indicates that
the small Greys or those of the Zeta Reticuli are basically mercenaries under
the domination of the Draconians, the Draco Reptiles, which are subservient
to the Orion Greys, even though they have greater military power and greater
force. The Draconian forces have the ability to take control away from the Orion
Greys, but the Orion Greys are such good managers of planets that the Draco
Reptoids do not envy them of there job and therefore, let themselves be the
military arm of the operation, while giving the economic and political control
to the Orion Forces.
(Revelations Awareness 93-14/NO. 423)
The
Fake Invasion and Fake Rapture
Religions & Monetary System Evolved from Orion
Even the Hindu writings of the earliest Sanskrit contain references to spacecrafts,
and throughout the world there are references and remnants of space aliens in
pictures, drawings and such as
the Nasca lines. This Awareness indicates that
the religion established by the aliens, promoted by the priestcraft which was
set up by aliens in order to control the masses, in order that civilization
could be developed on this plane, along with the monetary system, evolved out
of the Orion influence.
This Awareness reminds you of the Unholy 6 in Orion, the six planets, and the
planet known as Tyrantor, from which your word tyrant comes from, and that in
the middle east is that city called
Tyre, which in ancient time became the scourge
of travelers who were always stopped by the fleets and were forced to pay duty
for traveling anywhere in the area. This Awareness indicates that this was the
introduction of the monetary system that developed from the Orion influence
which later became a kind of evolving taxation program: the head tax, the toll.
The monetary system of reward and punishment for energies given or entities being fined or punished comes from the Orion system. The concept of punishing people by fining them or taking their money or rewarding them for energies that have been helpful is basically an Orion concept that was brought to Earth many centuries ago.
This Awareness indicates that it is also the source of the usury system of interest being extracted for the loan of money, for the use of money. This Awareness indicates that in terms of the interest and compound interest, these developed from Orion systems, and it has been responsible for the ultra-rich, such as the Rockefellers and Rothschilds and other major family wealth of those super-rich groups who, through banking and similar monetary movement, the movement of money, were able to garner the wealth of the world, through means of interest and usury at the expense of the masses and their labor.
The Reptoids Reward Entities in Drugs and Oppression
This Awareness indicates that there are some planets and cultures in the galaxy who do not use money at all, who use drugs, as rewards for hard work, or threats and oppression as punishment for not working hard enough, and these rewards and punishments are for them the equivalent of paying for a job well done or a job poorly done.
The Reptoids use this kind of coercion to keep their workers in line, whereby the workers can receive sustenance for their livelihood. They follow directions and do their duties, or they will receive great punishment or deprivation if they fail to do so.
How the Alchemy of Your Knowledge Works
It is the Will and Intend of this Awareness to prepare a certain small portion of society of aware people, so that their consciousness in being made aware, can have an alchemical effect on the mass-consciousness in a way that depolarizes and balances the energies on this plane.
This has to do with quantum physics in which polarized energies, being resolved in part, tend to affect the greater mass so that wherein the greater mass might have certain fears, the fears diminish as the fewer parts having already perceived and gone through the energizing of these concepts, harmonizing or reconciling these polarities, these fewer points of light help to defuse the fear and the polarization of the greater masses.
It is a principle in quantum physics that need to be understood, in order that entities better recognize why certain elements of consciousness in a small percentage can have profound effect on the greater mind of consciousness. When this Awareness speaks of consciousness, It speaks of the collective consciousness of humanity. This Awareness reminds entities that It is not playing favorites with humanity over the aliens simply because It is speaking through a human channel. These alien beings have certain intrinsic rights. This Awareness does however, recognize certain principles as being proper and appropriate and a certain manner of behavior as being appropriate, and wherein aliens are inappropriate in their behavior, this Awareness must express concern for that inappropriateness and tends to seek to influence reconciliation.
This Awareness indicates that wherein there is fear, whether within aliens or humans, this Awareness tends to seek to eliminate the fear, for fear tends to create problems, and courage tends to solve those problems. This Awareness indicates that It is not seeking to cause entities alarm. It would not tell most entities what is being given here to those who have been long-term recipients of messages from this Awareness. Those entities who are aware or who have the capacity to listen to that which is unusual without flinching, without fear, are those entities who are blessed and who are precious in that they can help to diffuse the negative energies that might accompany such information, and in so diffusing the negativity and the fear that others might feel, they become open to the possibility, and in so doing, harmonize the polarities associated with such information for the mass mind to consume.
It is likened unto a digestion, wherein part of the of the mind digest the information without becoming frightened and throwing up. If part of the mind can digest the information, then it breaks down the information to such levels that the rest of the mass-consciousness begins to accept the digested information on a subconscious level, so that when, indeed, the events transpire that pertain to the message, the entities are not so easily thrown off balance or into states of fear or into radical reactions.
(Revelations of Awareness 90-6 NO. 359)
Many Draconians Now in Human Bodies walk Among Us
This Awareness indicates that the Reptoid people do not necessarily appear as Reptoids when they reincarnate as human beings. They are simply humans in appearance, from human parents, but they have within their soul and background Reptoid genes and memory and are essentially from Draco in their origins, and there are many on this Earth who are Draconian in nature and their purpose is to gain power and destroy anything that preaches or attempts to establish a great harmony on Earth.
This Awareness indicate that this may be seen as related to the Hindu god Kali, the Destroyer. This Awareness indicates that it should be recognized that
the Draconian factor as that which is more destructive
and the so-called Serpent or Sirius factor as that which has been attempting to create greater harmony on the Earth
This Awareness indicates the Pleiadians as being distant cousins of humans, and they also being benefactors.
The Structure of Alien Government (Rape & Pillage Allowed)
(Revelations Awareness 92-14/NO.398)
Humanity in the meantime is semi-oblivious to all this and simply goes along
on their daily pursuit of pleasure/pain behavior life-styles. This Awareness
indicates that there are a very few people in the human population who understand
much about the overall picture in regard to the alien presence on earth or the
agendas of the alien presence and its overall intent.
(Revelations Awareness 93-14/NO. 423)
How the Orion Empire is Preparing our World for Takeover
This Awareness indicates that if you consider that the Earth is being made over to fit within the Orion Empire and the Draconian Federation so that it can become a galactic annexation, where it is annexed into the Galactic Federation and Orion Empire, then you understand why the corporate heads would also need to be part of this, you understand that the New World Order is being directed by these extraterrestrials to make the world, the Earth as you know it, into a kind of a planet that fits within the agenda of the Orion Empire and the Draco Federation through the control of the corporations and the governments.
The plan by these Draconian and Orion masters is eventually to get rid of all governments and simply have everything under corporation controls. This Awareness indicates that this gives them a complete hierarchical system for the ultimate type of dictatorial control. As long as there are governments, they see the governments as being wasteful and inefficient, but they see corporations as having a built-in hierarchy which allows the employees of all these corporations, which includes all of the masses on Earth, to be well-controlled by the corporations.
Thus, each entity in a corporation would be loyal to that corporation similar to the behavior of ants or beehives, where there is no room for any switching from one beehive or one anthill to another. In other words, entities would belong to the corporation. The entities, once in a corporation, would have family that also belongs to the corporation. This is the ultimate plan or agenda for the Earth as seen by these extraterrestrials.
This Awareness indicates that the corporation controlling each of its workers, would have a greater more absolute control than any government system could have, separate from such a hierarchy. This Awareness suggests that this essentially is what appears to be in back of the replacement of human individuals (several political leaders and corporate heads) by their synthetic or Robotoid clones.
20 Years Ago Awareness Discussed the Cloning Going On
This Awareness indicates it is interesting that only now, some 20 years later, it is being noted that sheep in the British Isles have been cloned, and that monkeys in Oregon have been cloned, and the concept of potential human cloning is now being discussed. This Awareness indicates 20 years ago, this cloning activity, when discussed by this Awareness ad by Dr. Beter was seen as having and absolute farce, ridiculous, and unbelievable.
This Awareness wishes you to understand that most of technology of the more secretive type is not made available to the public for approximately 20 years or more, and therefore the timing is right on for the disclosure of rudimentary cloning as a possibility, since it has been occurring for over 20 years.
(Revelations Awareness 97-8/NO. 485)
In fact, most humans do not yet recognize
this potential for enslavement by these forces, and therefore are more concerned
about what kind of health and technology these force may give them in terms
of enhancing their own particular power over others on earth. Those involved
in these higher levels wherein there is communication with the ET's or
aliens, are more concerned with what they are going to get out of the situation
as individual humans than they are by what the agenda has in store for the rest
of humanity.
Getting the Alien Federations Straight
A clarification about Orion
This Awareness wishes to make some clarifications in this respect:
that the majority of those known in Orion are of a negative nature
but that there are some planets and sectors of Orion that are positive in nature
Clarion is a planetary system, a star and planetary system that is of a positive nature
Betelgeuse and some of those stars in that general area are filled with planets that are of negative nature
This Awareness indicates that there are some hundred
and thirty planets in that area.
This Awareness indicates that there is also, besides the Orion Empire, the Draconian
Federation. The Draconians have absorbed those from Zeta Reticuli and have brought
these entities as mercenaries, but the Reticuli do not think of themselves so
much as part of the Federation - they refer to themselves more as a network.
The word "Reticuli" means network, and that is a traditional classification
in their history, which they do not easily shed. The Draconian Federation considers
however the Network as part of their Federation, subordinate to their controls.
The Draconian are able to control the Reticuli through treaties that have been
formed some hundred thousand years back, when they helped to rescue the Reticuli
from their dying planet (from excessive exposure to radiation) and infused it
with new life, and then, in return, gained control over the entities of the Reticuli.
The Reticuli hail from a binary star, that is, two stars that rotate together,
and live on planets close to these stars which are highly unlivable to humans,
being very heavy in heat and desert. The Reticuli, in coming to earth prefer
desert areas where the climate is quite warm. This Awareness indicates that
this in part is favorable because of their insect genetic qualities, which makes
up part of their total being. This Awareness indicates that the Draconians also
being cold-blooded beings, prefer the warm climates.
This Awareness indicates as to the concept of the Confederation, this is not a common term used in describing the amalgamation of these planets from the Pleiades, Vega, or the Sirius system, but has been borrowed from human tongue and from the persistent use of the term by channels to describe the amalgamation of these planets working together in this galaxy to try to hinder the spread of Draconian influence.
Genetic "Time-Release Capsule" to Trigger your Cosmic (Universal) Awareness
You are not unrelated to the Reptilians. You are more related to the mammal types, and these mammal types tend to dominate over a period of time, so that the Reptilian genetics weaken as time passes and the mammalian genetic strengthens. This Awareness indicates that there is also a genetic factor implanted in the human creation by the entities from Sirius who were involved. This was secretly put into the human equation by those from Sirius without others knowing about this, in which the Sirian beings, or genetic engineers, implanted within the human species a kind of holographic cell that would over a period of time, with each passing generation and with the rising of consciousness, put in a cell that upon a certain level of development, would react.
This may be equated unto a kind of time-release capsule, such as the pills you take that don't activate for eight hours and then activate at a certain time. This genetic cellular code was designed to activate with each passing generation, so that each passing generation became more aware, and as each generation becomes more aware, it becomes more God-like, a little at a time with each passing generation, and in this action, when the vibrations reach a certain state in the evolving human, it becomes possible for that cell to activate totally and the entity experience God realization and becomes cosmically aware, or totally conscious.
This Awareness indicates that each human being has this potential built in to the cells, but it does not release when the entities are engaged in selfish endeavors, self centered activities. It does not release when entities are engaged in hostility, greed, power, lust and the seeking of control over others. It engages only when the entity pursues the spiritual and Divine Light. This Awareness indicates that in this sense, you have options and those options allow you to choose a path toward spiritual enlightenment, and in doing so, to become God-realized.
The Intergalactic Confederation is Defined
This Awareness indicates that the so-called Intergalactic Command or Intergalactic
Confederation, this may be thought of more a grouping or alliance of highly
evolved spiritual beings of different star systems who have united in their
common purpose of hindering the Orion Empire and Draconian Federation from capturing
and enslaving other planets outside their already held Federation and Empires.
This Awareness indicates that those from
Vega have pledged their efforts to
help prevent the Empire and the Federation from taking control of Earth. Their
methods are not to intervene directly in the affairs from humans, and the humans
have allowed the Draconians and Orion Empire representatives to have bases on
Earth, therefore the Vegans, Lyrans and Pleiadians must honor the human decision
and treaties with the Draconians and Orion Empire and Reticuli Network to have
positions on Earth, until the humans choose otherwise.
How Vegan & Pleiadian Volunteers Work on
Earth
In the meantime the Vegans, those from Lyra and those from the
Pleiades have
also chosen ways to influence the human movement toward throwing off these would
be oppressors. The Vegans send some of their most advanced beings to be born
on earth with earthly parents and to grow and develop and do their work to help
prevent this take over of the planet by these Empire, Federation and Network
aliens. This Awareness indicates that the
Pleiadians
have also their volunteers. There have been those who came in space ships and
met directly with individuals (Billy Meier) and met directly with individuals
who were open and desirous of meeting with them. These entities even gave warning
about the Orion Empire and sought to prevent
the treaties (with the US Government),
but failed to do so*.
(* In
Behold A Pale Horse page 202,
William Cooper speaks also about a race
of humanoid aliens, ed)
Therefore, while they seek to help in whatever ways they can to hinder the Orion
Empire in its conquest or the Draconians in their various invasion plans, they
avoid direct interference in the affairs pertaining to these entities on Earth
They are even careful not to talk about these entities as being dangerous or
enemies of theirs or of mankind. Those from Lyra also incarnate into human form
to help change the vibrations and instill a sense of spiritual meaning into
the lives of those whom they come in contact with. That these are the ways whereby
the amalgamation of star systems work together to help Earth in its struggle
for survival and for spiritual enlightenment.
Andromeda? Any Decision by The Andromeda Council?
This Awareness indicates that as long as earth allows the Draconians and
Reticulians
to remain and treaties have been signed, that this more or less creates a block
to prevent interference from the Pleiades, Vegans or others. It is for this
reason that any contacts will be of a very minor nature, more to educate and
inform than to directly interfere or confront the Draconian, Reticulian and
Orion Empire Greys.
This Awareness indicates that
the Andromeda Council is much
like the UN on Earth; it has certain influence, but it has no power over those
who refuse to abide by its recommendations. The Draconian Confederation, the
Orion Empire; these do not give much credence to the Andromeda Council or its
recommendations. They appeal to it when they see a change to benefit or to use
it to their advantage. Therefore, at this time, anything given by the Andromeda
Council in regard to Earth has been generally ignored by these entities.
DOES ANYONE CONTROL THE REPTOIDS AND GREYS?
Asuras, Who Represent the Depth of Evil.
"Another part of the onion peeled"
These are likened unto a prototype of demonic energies. This Awareness
indicates that these entities have a control over the Reptoids in their own
Draco Galaxy, and have influence in other areas of the galaxies, particularly
where they can have cooperation between Reptoids and other groups that they
have conquered through their manipulative powers. That their power lies more
in their ability to conquer through manipulations, to conquer the heads of groups
and use those heads for furthering the extension of their own power over still
other groups.
They essentially work by conquering a group and using that group to conquer
other groups, and they tend to have no compassion of any kind so that no mercy
is shown to those whom they control and this allows them to extend fear from
the ranks of the highest to the lowest so that the entities under their control
are controlled by fear of their own superiors and will do the bidding of their
superiors, and the superiors are also controlled by fear. It is essentially
a power group epitomizing the basic concept of evil, if one is to describe
evil
as the absence of compassion, wherein their is no room for compassion.
They do not appear to have any particular home place or planet other than wherever
they happen to be. They roam the galaxy freely without an attachment to a particular
place and their attachment is to power itself, and to the enjoyment of exercising
power. Rudolph Steiner as having described the Asuras as prototypes or archetypes
of evil.
The Asuras: Gods Who Have Gone Mad
These entities as being degenerated from extremely high levels of spiritual
status, having taken with them the full awareness of the nature of creation,
and of the universal properties of creation, as they degenerated into concepts
of separateness, herein they can use this technology or knowledge for enhancing
their own illusion of separateness and power. It is as though one who understood
all of the knowledge of creation degenerated over time to play with the creation,
using this knowledge to torture and to entertain himself by playing with the
creation as though it were but an object and not filled with living beings.
This Awareness indicates that it is not intended to imply that these entities
are the creators of humans, but more that they understand the creation through
the use of vibrations and frequencies and have absolute and total contempt for
anything that is not as highly evolved intellectually as they are in their understanding
of these factors of creation.
They see the creation as but objects for them to move about and manipulate for
their own gain, including the creation of humans and other beings.
They are what may be termed "mad gods" who have gone off the deep
end into utter madness, through the pursuit of personal glory and pleasure for
their own separative interests, for their own demented enjoyment. (fallen Elohim)
Thus, the Asuras
are the reflections of Ahriman energies, and these energies,
being sadistic in nature, seek and enjoy destroying God's most highly prized
creation, the human being, and in the destruction of humans and other aspects
of Divine Creator's creation, they see themselves as challenging the Divine
Creator in a kind of open defiance. That defiance is what gives them the feeling
of having immense power."
Asuras Thrill at Causing Suffering
They would like to defy the Divine Creator, or if unable to defy directly,
then they defy the creation that has been established, and thus, they find great
thrill in destroying and causing suffering to that creation. It is based on
a kind of hatred for the Creator and thus, aim at their hatred at the creation,
especially anything that emits compassion, beauty, weakness in the sense of
gentleness, or love, for they see these things as aspects of the Father/Mother
Creator, and want to destroy that Father/Mother Creator aspect so that they
alone remain and so there is no such thing as love, compassion and qualities
of cooperativeness, but that there is only competition from their framework
better than they can control loyalties and devotion and love and such.
They are essentially beings from a dysfunctional family who see themselves having
to be in control, and the only control they understand is that which they can
wield over others through the use of power and fear. They are gods that
have
psychological problems of a very deep nature.
DOES ANYONE CONTROL THE ASURAS?
The Spiritual Agendas Supersede the Alien Agenda
They cannot see all that is seen by the Elohim who have not fallen from
grace. Thus, these entities in assisting to write the Alien Agenda, must write
it from limited perspective, not seeing that there is an agenda that lies beyond
theirs. There is that which may be termed the spiritual agenda which supersede
the alien agenda."
(Revelations Awareness 91-6/NO 381)
The Battle is to Save the Souls of the Earthlings
Essentially, the souls of people IS the issue involved
that is of greatest urgency to the Galactic Command or Confederation, for this
saving of the souls is that which the spiritual forces perceives to be the real
purpose and value. The physical body is temporal anyway, and has only a short
time on earth, but the soul being permanent, being more or less eternal, is
the more important concern.
The Draconian and the Orion forces think that by making it appear the soul is just an illusion and that one's body is what counts, they find themselves able to influence people by fear and by coercion, based on bodily needs and preservation. And in this manner they actually capture the souls of entities who are trying to preserve their body and will do so at the cost of their soul"
(Revelations Awareness 93-14/NO. 423)
As it is Below, So it is Above
This Awareness indicates that it appears that the entire box of Pandora,
is becoming unraveled. The door is opening and there seems to be no end in sight
in regards to the unraveling of activity, not just on earth, or even the solar
system, but activity throughout the galaxy, which if the strings are examined
enough, they begin to lead consciousness into looking into other universes.
This Awareness indicates that it has been suggested: As it is above, so it is
below. Entities may now begin to realize that likewise, as it is below, so it
is above. Humanity has been plagued with wars, but humanity is not alone; so
has the galaxy. This Awareness indicates that it does not appear that there
is yet an end to the recognition of the influence of these forces in the galaxy
and beyond, and that even the resolving of humanity's wars may only be the resolving
of a small battle in the galaxy.
This Awareness indicates that entities may learn to live in peace, even in the
midst of chaos; that even in the midst of war entities may develop a peace that
pass the understanding within their own hearts. This Awareness indicates that
this may be the only way in which entities can find peace: Not by controlling
the world outside, but by controlling one's own peace within.

A New
Script For Humanity
To Prevent the Final Act from Happening
A Great Force is Moving across this Plane
This Awareness indicates there is a great force moving upon your plane that
is little understood by entities and may be likened unto a storm in consciousness,
blown in from the psychic sea of the Fourth Dimension, that transcends time
and space and moves in from ancient times of
Atlantis and into the present moment.
It is ready to be calmed, if that is allowed by the collective consciousness
of entities upon this plane, or it is ready to wreak havoc if that is what it
takes to complete its action.
This Awareness indicates that this force, this programming, is likened unto
a type of linear programming that has reached through thousands of years, by
which entities were polarized as programmed parts of an incredible complex and
massive computer system called "Civilization", wherein the script
was written thousands of years ago, and historians of today are only as reporters
and reviewers of that play, that dramatic epic that has played for thousands
of years upon this stage called "Earth"
How the Programming Began
This programming, which began with that ancient priestcraft in Atlantis, was
designed to create division in consciousness, to create divisions of superior
and inferior levels of rank and hierarchy. The rank of the priestcraft being
programmed in a manner to allow them to retain power over the masses as they
progress from one generation to another, from one incarnation to another.
This action, wherein six million entities were mummified and strategically placed
in certain areas of the earth to create a maximum of polarity within the earth's
forces, in an attempt to create that division of consciousness on many levels,
in an attempt to create certain wave length and a hierarchy system of vibrations,
in an attempt to create layer upon layer of different vibrations which could
be managed by these priescraft rulers, in their control and understanding of
consciousness and power, allowed them to manipulate masses for eons of time
upon your plane.
These were the followers of Baal, and were representative of Rhyee, that force
which was the original separateness, and which has more recently been called
by the name of Lucifer. These priescraft rulers understood the action of the
mind and its structuring mechanism so well, that they not only structured civilizations
and societies patterned after the mind, but even perfected the mechanisms whereby
they could project these patterns down to the corridor of time, creating civilizations
and events until the present era.
How Ra-Ta (Edgar Cayce) Opened the Floodgates
This Awareness indicates, this action which began some sixty thousands years
ago, reached its height of power about twenty-five years ago and began to lose
its power approximately ten thousand years B.C. after Ra-Ta set about a counter-action,
a counter-force of greater power to reverse the trend toward the previous accumulations
of power. This occurred at the beginning of the Virgo age as the forces of anti-matter
began to wane during the approaching dark cycle which has dominated the earth
for these past 12.000 years.
This Awareness indicates the action of Ra-Ta and the builders of the Pyramid
and Sphinx in ancient Egypt were designed to offer a greater attraction, a greater
power than those of the Atlantean priests, and once the seekers of power were
caught up in the Egyptian power, they were led along the path that brought them
not only to power, but that enlightenment and realization that power was not
the answer to the gravings of the appetite. In this action, many followers of
Baal, of Lucifer, were brought into the Law of One.
This Awareness indicates that
Edgar Cayce, the reincarnate spirit of Ra-Ta,
opened the doors for the flood of consciousness upon this plane, to allow that
force to begin moving from that Fourth Dimension into this present time. In
this action, the Lucifer, The Rhyee, the personification of that first separateness,
was given an opportunity to tap into this ancient power that began in Egypt,
and in so doing, was drawn unwittingly into states of Awareness that led back
to the Law of One, and this Awareness.
This Awareness indicates that force known as Lucifer is now being drawn out
of consciousness and moving into Essence. The Head of the Beast, the original
separateness, has already returned to Essence. Only the organs and body of this
remains upon your plain, and must, in time, follow also into the return to Essence.
Why Awareness has Come at this Time
This Awareness indicates all present attempts to pursue and maintain power and
control over others are but creating structures that will inevitable be converted
into systems designed to serve the people rather than to enslave them; yet,
it is a matter of when this will occur, rather than whether it
will occur. It is for this reason that this Awareness communicates with entities
at this time, and it is for this purpose that entities need to look closely
at that which is occurring on their plane, for these energies are a potential
force that may be used for good or ill at this time, even as a wind may be harnessed
for service, or may wreak havoc.
This Awareness indicates any good computer programmer can understand the programming
system used in Atlantis and Egypt if they are also capable of comprehending
the nature of psychic forces, and can comprehend the Pyramid and Sphinx as being
likened unto the pituitary and pineal of the collective consciousness upon this
plane, and the mummified corpses may be understood as human transmitters, capacitors
or other psycho-electro-magnetic components.
This Awareness indicates this action created great suffering for many millions
of entities upon this plane, and that action from Atlantis was initiated for
the glory and the power of the followers of Baal, the followers of Lucifer,
the followers of the mind, and its structuring system of hierarchy, polarity,
manipulation and control.
Ra Ta's Power Trap for the Dark Force
This Awareness indicates
the Illuminati that began in Atlantis, may be seen
as the Dark Force that sought power through deception, control and manipulation;
and that Illuminati from Ra-Ta actions of Egypt was designed to create a power
trap that led to enlightenment and a return to the Law of One.
This Awareness indicates that these mummies, serving as frozen consciousness,
holding symbolic patterns and programs in their frozen psyches, allowed that
energy, those patterns and symbols to be released slowly into consciousness
at precise intervals as their mummified bodies decayed.
The Influence of Mummification in Egypt
The entity serving as a channel for this message (Paul Shockley) was such a
mummified component of that psychic computer system, and carried within his
being the symbol of an onion, that allowed an opening up, one layer at a time,
one after another, in such a manner that an awakening would occur at certain
times in the appropriate lifetime in accordance with the script written and
composed in the land of Nubia, while Ra-Ta and his associates were in
exile
there, prior to the construction of the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx.
This Awareness indicates the action of the Egyptian Force was designed to speed
up evolution, by creating intensities and collective power and forces that would
bring entities together during a dark side of a cycle that began with the Age
of Virgo and ended with the Age of Pisces, a time when entities would ordinarily
be driven away from one another by forces of self-concern, created by the greater
magnetic waves during this dark cycle. This Awareness indicates the Egyptian
action brought entities together in order to have a greater power in numbers,
to create greater unity against the group or nation which would oppose them.
This led to the formations of civilizations, nations and societies.
This Awareness indicates the programming of certain images and events, energy
fields, and the release of concepts into consciousness created historical landmarks
and cultural changes through the subsequent history of Egypt, Babylon, Chafed,
Israel and other nations, and up into the various civilizations of the present
time. This was all pre-written in general outline, likened unto a plot
of a play, a story or a script. This Awareness indicates the script, having
been pre-written, can continue to be played as it was intended by these forces,
wherein the Computer Beast does set up its controls and power over the masses,
and wherein entities do suffer through the "Tribulations" as has been
prophesied in the Book of Revelations, and wherein entities after great
suffering, eventually are freed as the Beast and the followers of the Beast
are moved into predetermined destruction.
Awareness Comes Like a Thief in the Night
This script may continue and may occur in this manner if entities do insist
in having it happen in this manner, due to programmed attitudes and belief
patterns in their consciousness. However, this Awareness has come at this time,
likened unto a thief in the night, and offer that opportunity, that alternative
action, that a new script, which entities may claim as their own, as a rapture
and an escape from the greater tribulations that lie ahead on the path of the
present programming.
Rothshilds and Rockefellers Unwitting Victims
in the Drama
This Awareness wishes no ill to any entity, does not wish that they should perish,
but that all should inherit eternal life. eternal joy, and eternal peace. This
Awareness indicates
the Rothschilds and
the Rockefellers also are unwitting
victims of the programming from these ancient script-writer, and are simply
playing the roles that are being forced upon them.
This Awareness offers entities on this plane an opportunity to change the ending
of this script, to allow all entities to be free of these ancient forces whose
originators are no longer in control id these forces, and are not even aware
of their own involvement in having started the movement of these forces. This
Awareness indicates the forces may be defused, may be stopped, but it is only
through the changing of consciousness that this may occur, and consciousness
cannot be changed until entities look at what is happening from a new viewpoint,
a new perspective.
A Call to Awaken Entities Upon this Plane
This Awareness wishes to call attention to what is happening on this plane,
not in order to set one force against another, not to condemn, nor judge anyone,
but to awaken entities on this plane so that millions need not suffer
needlessly. This Awareness suggests that once the attention is called to the
problem of the money-systems, and the works of the money-changers, it becomes
necessary to awake the masses to the realization that the Rockefellers and the
Rothschilds are being controlled and programmed also, and have little or no
choice in their lives, and are being forced to play the roles which they are
playing.
This Awareness wishes entities to understand that it is not necessary to continue
this drama; that this drama, the entire scene, the entire final act is unnecessary
and inappropriate and need not climax on human life upon this Earth. This Awareness
indicates that entities need only look totally once at that which is happening
upon this plane, and when this is done completely, wherein there is no fear
or flinching, wherein enough of consciousness sees clearly what is happening,
then entities may look away and never again to look at this unworthy scene.
Wherein this is seen clearly enough, that entities never again will be trapped
and seduced by the money-changers, the old drama may be transcended, and a new
drama may begin, which will free entities from the economic bondage to the money-changers,
and will free the money-changers from fear and terror of the masses that force
them to deceive and to seek greater power to avoid confrontation with the masses.
How to Avoid the Battle of Armageddon
This Awareness indicates that every human face is every other human face, and
in the human face there is seen the need for love, peace, harmony, respect and
dignity. This Awareness wishes to awaken entities to that piece, dignity, respect,
love, and that life of harmony, whereby each entity looks out for the welfare
of each other entity, and thereby avoiding that tragedy, sorrow, violence; and
that which has been called the "Battle of Armageddon" need not occur
on the outer plane.
There is Fire Ringing in Your Home!
This Awareness indicates there are many entities who do not wish to be awakened
from their slumber and their illusion of security to hear of a fire raging in
their home, for this is disturbing information. There are many entities who
prefer spiritual messages that soothe, lull, and hypnotize with beautiful words
and concepts, and sounds, and rituals, and images to adore, and saints and angels
to praise and glorify; yet, this Awareness indicates these are but trappings
of spiritual living and are not the spiritual life: they are but reminders,
the garments of life.
And this Awareness indicates many teachers, priests and spiritual leaders spout
forth the beautiful words and lulling tones and claim association with those
angels and saints of old, but are simply selling the the trappings of spiritual
life to their followers, and indeed many of these even take special precautions
to keep their followers ignorant of certain truths which give these spiritual
leaders and advantage over their followers. This Awareness indicates it is only
natural that these so called "spiritual leaders" would object to messages
from this Awareness which might threaten the "hustle" they have going
for themselves.
This Awareness suggests many of the churches, religious organizations and groups
promoting spiritual teachings are spouting the proper words that appeal to the
seeker of truth, yet are leading their followers down the trail, following the
Beast toward the Bottomless Pit, all because they, themselves, are out to make
a buck or two on the wave of spiritual energy that is blowing across the earth.
These entities and their followers, who trail obediently behind the Beast and
its commands, shall find indeed they have raped the whirlwind.
Believe Nothing, But Open Your Eyes
This Awareness asks entities not to believe anything, but to look carefully
at everything, and to discern careful what appears to be, yet to make
up their minds about nothing, but to continue to search, to remain open to discovery,
to remain in a state of "I don't know; for in that state, you cannot be
closed to further learning, and you will remain open to discovery without pre-judging
anything.
This Awareness indicates there are many truths found in many of the spiritual
teachings and groups, and these may be likened unto pearls of great price, yet
this Awareness indicates that it takes more than beautiful words and flowers
to make a wedding and marriage that is lasting, healthy and fulfilling; and
it takes more than ritual, beautiful words, names of deities and saints, and
soft lulling tones to lead to spiritual understanding and expression.
This Awareness indicates there is also a need to see the tragedy, the suffering,
the sorrow that exists upon this plane, and to look so deeply at this that the
feeling of compassion becomes so unbearable, so overwhelmingly painful, that
its very urgency becomes the motivation that moves you into action which can
reconcile the polarities that cause such suffering. This Awareness indicates
that in looking at a stereotyped ideal of what a spiritual life should be, is
but a form of escape from reality, and has never yet been instrumental in helping
to relieve the suffering on this plane, and in fact, has led entities to battle
and to kill over such ideals.
This Awareness indicates that to heal another, one must look carefully at the
illness, and then begin to raise the vibrations from that what is, to that which
is imaged as desirable in the next moment. And step by step, moment by moment
image by image, the situation, the vibration of the situation, can be raised.
This must start from What Is, not from what should be, or what
would be nice to observe.
Let's All Help Cosmic Awareness to Find Rest
In dealing with illness of power within individuals , or in the earth, the need
is to look at What Is, then to start raising the vibrations from there.
Entities have it in their power to change the world, to change the course of
events, and to bring a heaven on Earth. The future is never fixed, and
becomes changed as consciousness changes.
This Awareness wishes entities to understand consciousness can only change when
entities no longer judge themselves or others, when entities no longer seek
to be higher or further out, greater or more powerful than another or themselves.
When entities can accept themselves as they are, then they can move on to other
ways of being. For this Awareness is not concerned with whether entities are
materialistic, spiritual, right or wrong, higher or lower, ascended or descended,
but whether entities love one another and whether entities love themselves,
and are responsive to the needs of one another.
This Awareness asks not for sacrifice, but for service. This Awareness asks
not for praise, but for service and love toward your fellow creatures. For this
Awareness needs not service, nor does It need sacrifice or praise, but needs
only to experience a rest and relief from watching this dreary tragedy on your
plane, as the world turns round and around and round.
