# U.S. Leaves ICANN - Opens Door for Global Internet Governance

The US National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA),
a branch of the Department of Commerce (DOC), is
ending its relationship with the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN) in 2015 because of the
global
governance model (GGM) being adopted by the regulatory agency.
NTIA is currently contracted to operate key domain-name functions with
ICANN. This split will leave ICANN to develop their GGM without the
formal assistance of the US.
Lawrence Strickling, administrator for NTIA explained that the GGM
must,
"maintain the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet
Domain Name System (DNS)."
Strickling is emphatic that the GMM should retain the openness of the
internet and stated that the NTIA,
"will not accept a proposal that
replaces the NTIA role with a government-led or intergovernmental
solution."
The NTIA is relinquishing their position to the
"global internet
community"; yet is concerned that the UN, Russia or China may step in to
take over their former position with ICANN.
Fadi Chehade, president of ICANN
said:
"We thank the U.S. government for its
stewardship, for its guidance over the years, and we thank them
today for trusting the global community to replace their stewardship
with the appropriate accountability mechanisms."
Senator and Commerce Committee chair Jay Rockefeller praised the move
by the US as the,
"next phase [in] an independent entity
that reflects the broad diversity of the global internet community."
In 2012, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) made clear
their intentions to assert
control over the internet.
At the time, Congress agreed to
resist the attempt of the United
Nations to usurp the web "with everything
[they] have".
The ITU proclaims that because the internet is a
"global entity" that
the UN should have jurisdiction over it, manage its abilities according
to global UN standards and engage restrictions that could be installed
at the fundamental level of the internet to prevent any infractions of
international mandates.
The UN wants to include the DNS along with the ICANN, which is now
free from their ties to the US government.
Hamadoun Toure, the ITU secretary-general,
stated that:
"When an invention becomes used by
billions across the world, it no longer remains the sole property of
one nation, however powerful that nation might be."
ICANN operates now as a multi-stakeholder that involves groups like
the Internet Engineering task Force and the World Wide Web Consortium.
Despite critics and alleged conflicts of interest, the expansion of
top-level domains, this action is a sort of "land grab" for
domain names.
