Can you imagine participating in a
protest outside the White House and forcing the entire U.S.
government to resign?
-
Can you imagine a group of randomly
chosen private citizens rewriting the U.S. constitution to include
measures banning corporate fraud?
It seems incomprehensible in the U.S., but
Icelanders did just that.
Icelanders forced their entire government to
resign after a banking fraud scandal, overthrowing the ruling party and
creating a citizens group tasked with writing a new constitution that
offered a solution to prevent corporate greed from destroying the country.
The constitution of Iceland was scrapped and is
being rewritten by private citizens; using a crowd-sourcing technique via
social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter.
These events have been going on since 2008, yet
theres been no word from the U.S. mainstream media about any of them.
In fact, all of the events that unfolded were
recorded by international journalists, overseas news bureaus, citizen
journalists and bloggers. This has created current accusations of an
intentional cover up of the story by mainstream U.S. news sources.
An "iReport" on CNN, written by a private citizen in May 2012, has
questioned the reasons why this revolution has not been widely covered in
the U.S., suggesting that perhaps
the mainstream media is controlled by large
corporate interests and thus has been unwilling to report on Icelands
activities.
That report is currently making its way around
social media.
CNN today placed a statement on its website
saying:
"Weve noticed this iReport is being shared
widely on Facebook and Twitter. Please note that this article was posted
in May 2012. CNN has not yet verified the claims and were working
to track down the original writer."
It is interesting to note that CNNs European
version, CNN Europe, already covered the story of the protests and the
governments resignation, leading many to question why CNN would now need to
"look into" the claims.
Besides CNN Europes own coverage of the scandal, the events in Iceland were
widely covered by international media and are easily verified by a simple
search on Google which leads to a variety of reputable international news
sources that ran numerous stories on the Icelandic revolution.
A whole documentary has been made on the
governmental overthrow called Pots, Pans and Other Solutions (bottom
page video), and now, the conversation is focused on whether or not the
citizens actions actually worked to make Iceland a more equitable nation.
To understand the enormity of what happened in Iceland, its best to draw
parallels between the initial banking fraud that caused Icelands economy to
collapse and the banking fraud in the U.S. that caused the mortgage crisis
six years ago.
In Iceland, unscrupulous bankers had inflated
the value of Icelands banks internationally which in turn caused the
"bubble" to eventually burst in 2008 and saw most of Icelands banks going
bankrupt.
A similar situation happened in the U.S. just one year before the collapse
in Iceland, with the mortgage crisis of 2007. Mortgage lenders in the U.S.
knowingly lent money to prospective homeowners who could not afford to
purchase a home. This, in turn, led to falsely inflated home values and a
vicious cycle of too much lending.
Just as in Iceland, the bubble burst and many
U.S. banks were about to declare bankruptcy.
In Iceland, the citizens took to the streets by
the thousands, banging pots and pans in what is known as the "pots and pans
revolution," leading to the arrest and prosecution of many unscrupulous
bankers responsible for the economic collapse. Icelandic citizens also
refused to pay for the sins of the bankers and rejected any measures of
taxation to bail them out.
In the U.S., the government bailed out the banks
and arrested no one.
The pots and pans revolution in Iceland was not covered by mainstream U.S.
media.
In fact, any information about this revolution
is found only on international newspapers, blogs and online documentaries,
not on mainstream front-page articles as would be expected from news
organizations covering a story of this magnitude.
The New York Times published a small handful of
piecemeal stories, blogs and opinion pieces, but mostly glossed over the
main narrative by saying the 2008 financial collapse in Iceland caused
"mayhem far beyond the countrys borders" rather than pointing out that
Icelanders took to the streets with pots and pans and forced their entire
government to resign.
As the saying goes,
"there are two sides to every story," but a
more accurate articulation of this phrase would be "in any story, there
are multiple sides, viewpoints, opinions and perspectives."
The story in Iceland is no exception.
Socialist and Marxist blogs here in the U.S. say
that theres been a massive U.S. news conspiracy and cover up about the
revolution in Iceland because the U.S. media is controlled by corporations,
including banks, and the "powers
that be" dont want U.S. citizens getting any ideas to stage a
revolution of their own.
Some conservative Icelandic bloggers claim that
while there was, indeed, a revolution, it did not lead to a successful or
widely accepted new constitution.
They say the situation in Iceland is worse than
ever, and that international news reports of an effective democratic
uprising leading to a better government are simply myths. Social media
commenters are scratching their heads over why they were robbed of the story
of Icelands pots and pans revolution.
As with most narratives, the truth may lie somewhere in the middle of all of
these varying perspectives.
One thing is clear, though:
its nearly impossible to find one
mainstream U.S. news report of the pots and pans revolution in Iceland,
the resignation of Icelands entire government, and the jailing of the
bankers responsible for the economic collapse there.
Whether or not the revolution led to a more fair
government or a workable and effective constitution is irrelevant to the
fact that the U.S. media has essentially skipped over this story for the
past five years.
-
Is it possible that mainstream media
sources purposely covered up the Iceland story to appease their
corporate sponsors?
-
It doesnt seem likely, and yet, what
explanation could be given as to why this news never made it to the
front pages of our most trusted media organizations here in the
U.S.?
As Iceland struggles to regain its footing with
a new government, U.S. citizens may or may not be able to look to Iceland as
an example of perfect democracy in action.
The real question, though, is,
-
Why werent U.S. citizens given the
information about the ousting of the Icelandic government and the
jailing of the unscrupulous bankers?
-
Are journalists in control of the
mainstream media or is there some truth to accusations that big
business may, in fact, be strong-arming reporters to keep quiet
about world events that could inspire similar actions here in the
U.S.?
