# After Me, the Jihad - Gaddafi's Unheeded Warning to the West

Before the French Revolution and
its Reign of Terror, Louis XV predicted,
"After me, the Deluge."
Before being overthrown, Libya's
secular dictator tried to warn the West of a new Reign of
Terror, essentially foretelling,
"After me, the Jihad."
This was disclosed with the
recent release of
phone conversations from early 2011 between Muammar
Gaddafi and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The West was then gearing up to use unrest in
Libya as a
pretext for military intervention and regime change.
Gaddafi desperately tried to
convey through Blair the folly of such a war, pleading that
he was trying to defend Libya from Al Qaeda, which had set
up base in the country.
He said:
"They have managed to get
arms and terrify people. People can't leave their
homes
It's a jihad
situation. They have arms and are
terrorizing people in the street."
Gaddafi's warning went unheeded,
and NATO, led by the U.S. and France, launched an air war that
toppled Libya's government.
Later that year, Gaddafi
(himself a brutal oppressor, like all heads of state) was
forced out of a drainage pipe, and then beaten, sodomized,
and shot in the street by a mob.
His corpse was then draped
over the hood of a car.
U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton, who
had done more than any single person
to advance the Libya War, was informed of Gaddafi's
death while on camera.
Fancying herself a modern
'Caesar,' she chortled,
"We came, we saw, he died!"
Since then, Gaddafi has been
proven tragically right.
As Libya descended into civil
war and failed-state chaos, jihadi groups connected to Al
Qaeda conquered much of the country. Libya underwent the
same American "liberation" that had already befallen,
-
Afghanistan
-
Iraq
-
Somalia,
...and would soon be visited on
Syria and Yemen.
Shortly after Gaddafi's
overthrow, some of the now-rampant jihadis helped the CIA
run guns from Benghazi to fellow jihadis in Syria.
Benghazi had been a rebel
stronghold. The
Obama administration claimed a
Gaddafi-perpetrated "genocide" was imminent in that city,
using that claim as the chief
justification for the war.
There was zero indication of such an impending atrocity.
But there was ample evidence of
an Al Qaeda presence in Benghazi, as Gaddafi tried to tell
Blair, saying that members had:
"
managed to set up local
stations and in Benghazi have spread the thoughts and
ideas of al Qaeda."
After the regime change, on
September 11, 2012, the jihadis turned on their U.S. allies in
Benghazi, sacked the U.S. diplomatic compound, and murdered
Ambassador Chris Stevens. Now ISIS has spread throughout
Libya.
Just days ago, ISIS perpetrated a truck bombing that
killed dozens at a Libyan
police academy in Sirte, a former Gaddafi stronghold.
Indeed, Gaddafi informed Blair
that jihadis had "attacked police stations" back in 2011.
Gaddafi further warned Blair:
"They want to control the
Mediterranean and then they will attack Europe."
And ISIS has indeed been
battling to take control of
Libya's main oil ports in recent weeks.
The group has also long been
planning to
use Libya as a base from which to launch attacks on
nearby southern Europe. ISIS did strike Europe recently,
most famously
in Paris.
And it was not just Gaddafi
personally who had been ringing such alarms to the Western
powers thirsting for his blood.
His intelligence officers
produced
reports demonstrating that heavy weapons being sent,
with NATO approval and Qatari financing, to the Libyan
opposition were being funneled to militants with ties to Al
Qaeda.
At least one of those reports
was even prepared in English, to facilitate its transmission
to key members of Congress via U.S. intelligence.
Yet, there was no need for the
West to rely on the Libyan regime for information about the
jihadi threat.
Indeed, as
emails recently released by the State Department reveal,
Hillary Clinton's own right-hand man had informed her before
Gaddafi's overthrow that rebels were committing
war crimes and that,
"
radical/terrorist groups
such as the Libyan Fighting Groups and Al Qa'ida in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC and its
military command."
As Brad Hoff
reports, that same email discloses that, very early in
the Libyan crisis:
"British, French, and
Egyptian special operations units were training Libyan
militants along the Egyptian-Libyan border, as well as
in Benghazi suburbs."
They would soon be joined by
U.S. special forces and
the CIA:
The war in Libya that,
...were driving toward was so
predictably a fiasco-to-come that, behind the backs of the
Amazon Warriors Three, America's
top generals conspired with leftie peacenik Congressman
Dennis Kucinich to try to arrange a peaceful resolution to
the crisis.
But the war-making diplomats
triumphed over the diplomacy-making soldiers. Hillary
buffaloed the brass and got her war. Abundant warnings of a Jihadi
Deluge continued after the regime change as well.
As Nancy Youssef wrote at
The Daily Beast:
"
many celebrated Libya as a
success story of limited U.S. intervention despite
obvious signs there of looming instability.
The British consulate in
Benghazi came under an attempted assassination attack
the previous summer and other nations pulled out amid
rising violence. The U.S. consulate in Benghazi suffered
an improvised bomb attack around the time of the strike
on the British. And there were early signs of a rising
jihadist presence in the eastern city.
In Tripoli, Sufi shrines
were destroyed. (
)
In the months leading up to
the [2012 Benghazi] attack, flags belonging to a
jihadist group, Ansar al Sharia, appeared in Benghazi.
Ansar al Sharia members also controlled security around
certain government buildings, including the hospital
that would try to save Stevens.
In that ensuing power
vacuum, jihadists began claiming territory, making it
difficult for the moderate government to control the
country.
By 2013, Libya's oil
production all but stopped as the nation plunged toward
civil war and a state led by two rival governments on
opposite ends of the country. Efforts to create a unity
government have so far faltered. Benghazi, the
birthplace of the 2011 uprising, became a terrorist
haven.
And today, many Libyans
yearn for the return of Gaddafi, however dictatorial his
regime was, because of the security that came with him."
Conservative politicos have long
strained to use Benghazi to torpedo Hillary's bid for the
presidency.
But their efforts are crippled
by their own fundamental agreement with Hillary's
militarism. They support the general policy of employing
jihadis to overthrow secular dictators (not only in Libya,
but Syria too).
So they limit themselves to whining about
Hillary's security measures...
The true Benghazi scandal
indicts not just Hillary, but the entire Western power
elite, whose wars have, as Gaddafi warned, flooded
the world with a Jihadi Deluge and installed a
postdiluvian
Reign of Terror over us all.
