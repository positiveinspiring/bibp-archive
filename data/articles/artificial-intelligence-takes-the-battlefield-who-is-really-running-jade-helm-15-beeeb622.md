Who is really going to be running Jade Helm 15?
There is more to the story than just training for martial law in states designated as "hostile states" - already a chilling pretext with overtones of greater federal power that could spiral out of control.
But it seems that it is actually A.I. - artificial intelligence - that is at the helm of an enormous and unprecedented military drill.
A scary thought for sure but what does it really mean?
If analysts are correct, it seems that "JADE" is an acronym for a DARPA-developed A.I. quantum computing technology that produces holographic battlefield simulations and will be in charge of the drill in order to "master the human" domain and predict human response.

Level 9 News (below video), who appeared in the above interview with John B. Wells, gave a 38 minute YouTube presented about what exactly she has uncovered concerning JADE Helm as an artificial intelligence exercise - talk about adding layers of meaning to the 2015 Bilderberg discussion of A.I!
The "JADE" in Jade Helm 15 is an A.I. SOFTWARE Program
Level 9 News wrote under the header "Rise of the Machine" that:
RISE OF THE MACHINE
"JADE" is an A.I. quantum computing technology that produces holographic battlefield simulations and has the ability to use vast amounts of data being collected on the human domain to generate human terrain systems in geographic population centric locations to identify and eliminate targets, insurgents, rebels or whatever labels that can be flagged as targets in a Global Information Grid for Network Centric Warfare environments.
The JADE II battle field system is cognitive and intuitive.
It can examine prior executed battle plans and and devise 'new and better' strategies to increase the 'kill chain'. The II generation of JADE has the capability for two way communication with drones through the OCCOM technology which is one of the next generation integrations to this system.
In short, JADE HELM will not be battles directed by Generals and Military Commanders, but by a computer. It is a cognitive software program based on a Network Centric Warfare System at the HELM.
The rapid weaponization of drones - with thousands now taking over skies - was just the beginning.
Along with coordinated efforts with human military teams, the A.I. computers are already being rolled out for the battlefield. In a short time, weaponized robots will join them, and autonomous, learning, thinking computers will thereafter put humans out of the loop of decision making - and take lives into their own hands.
This document describes a military A.I. strategy that fits this view of JADE Helm including an AI program named JADE II.
Whatever the full scope, these future trends for conflict and population control should be closely monitored.
