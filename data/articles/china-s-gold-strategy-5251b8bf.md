China first delegated the management
of gold policy to the Peoples Bank by regulations in 1983.
This development was central to
China's emergence as a free-market economy following the
post-Mao reforms in 1979/82. At that time the west was doing its
best to suppress gold to enhance confidence in paper currencies,
releasing large quantities of bullion for others to buy.
This is why the timing is important:
it was an opportunity for China,
a one-billion population country in the throes of rapid
economic modernization, to diversify growing trade surpluses
from the dollar.
To my knowledge this subject has not
been properly addressed by any private-sector analysts, which
might explain why it is commonly thought that China's gold
policy is a more recent development, and why even industry
specialists show so little understanding of the true position.
But in the thirty-one years since
China's gold regulations were enacted, global mine production
has increased above-ground stocks from an estimated 92,000
tonnes to 163,000 tonnes today, or 71,000 tonnes;1
and while the west was also reducing its stocks in a
prolonged bear market all that gold was hoarded somewhere.
The period I shall focus on is
between 1983 and 2002, when gold ownership in China was finally
liberated and the Shanghai Gold Exchange was formed.
The fact
that the Chinese authorities permitted private ownership of gold
suggests that they had by then acquired sufficient gold for
monetary and strategic purposes, and were content to add to them
from domestic mine production and Chinese scrap thereafter
rather than through market purchases.
This raises the question as to how
much gold China might have secretly accumulated by the end of
2002 for this to be the case.
China's 1983 gold regulations
coincided with the start of a western bear market in gold, when
Swiss private bankers managing the largest western depositories
reduced their clients' holdings over the following fifteen years
ultimately to very low levels. In the mid-eighties the London
bullion market developed to enable future mine and scrap
supplies to be secured and sold for immediate delivery.
The bullion delivered was leased or
swapped from central banks to be replaced at later dates.
A respected American analyst,
Frank Veneroso, in a 2002 (International Gold Symposium) speech
(Gold
Derivatives, Gold Lending, Official Management of the Gold
Price, and the Current State of the Gold Market) in Lima
(Peru) estimated total
central bank leases and swaps to be between 10,000 and 16,000 tonnes at that time.
This amount has to be subtracted
from official reserves and added to the enormous increase in
mine supply, along with western portfolio liquidation. No one
actually knows how much gold was supplied through the markets,
but this must not stop us making reasonable estimates.
Between 1983 and 2002, mine
production, scrap supplies, portfolio sales and central bank
leasing absorbed by new Asian and Middle Eastern buyers probably
exceeded 75,000 tonnes. It is easy to be blasé about such large
amounts, but at today's prices this is the equivalent of $3
trillion.
The Arabs had surplus dollars and
Asia was rapidly industrializing.
Both camps were not much influenced
by western central bank propaganda aimed at side-lining gold in
the new era of floating exchange rates, though Arab enthusiasm
will have been diminished somewhat by the severe bear market as
the 1980s progressed.
The table below summarizes the
likely distribution of this gold.
Today, many believe that India is
the largest private sector market, but in the 12 years following
the repeal of the
Gold Control Act in 1990, an estimated 5,426 tonnes only were imported (Source: Indian Gold Book 2002), and
between 1983 and 1990 perhaps a further 1,500 tonnes were
smuggled into India, giving total Indian purchases of about
7,000 tonnes between 1983 and 2002.
That leaves the rest of Asia
including,
-
the Middle East
-
China
-
Turkey
-
South-East Asia
Of the latter two, Turkey probably
took in about 4,000 tonnes, and we can pencil in 5,000 tonnes
for South-East Asia, bearing in mind the tiger economies'
boom-and-bust in the 1990s.
This leaves approximately 55,000
tonnes split between the Middle East and China, assuming 4,850
tonnes satisfied other unclassified demand.
The Middle East began to accumulate
gold in the mid-1970s, storing much of it in the vaults of the
Swiss private banks. Income from oil continued to rise, so
despite the severe bear market in gold from 1980 onwards,
Middle-Eastern investors continued to buy.
In the 1990s, a new generation of
Swiss portfolio managers less committed to gold was advising
clients, including those in the Middle East, to sell.
At the same time, discouraged by
gold's bear market, a western-educated generation of Arabs
started to diversify into equities, infrastructure spending and
other investment media. Gold stocks owned by Arab investors
remain a well-kept secret to this day, but probably still
represents the largest quantity of vaulted gold, given the scale
of petro-dollar surpluses in the 1980s.
However, because of the change in
the Arabs' financial culture, from the 1990s onwards the pace of
their acquisition waned.
By elimination this leaves China as
the only other significant buyer during that era.
Given that Arab enthusiasm for gold
diminished for over half the 1983-2002 period, the Chinese
government being price-insensitive to a western-generated bear
market could have easily accumulated in excess of 20,000 tonnes
by the end of 2002.
China's reasons for
accumulating gold
We now know that China had the
resources from its trade surpluses as well as the opportunity to
buy bullion.
Heap-leaching techniques boosted
mine output and western investors sold down their bullion, so
there was ample supply available; but what was China's motive?
Initially China probably sought to
diversify from US dollars, which was the only trade currency it
received in the days before the euro.
Furthermore, it would have
seemed nonsensical to export goods in return for someone else's
paper specifically inflated to pay them, which is how it must
have appeared to China at the time.
It became obvious from European and
American attitudes to China's emergence as an economic power
that these export markets could not be wholly relied upon in the
long term.
So following Russia's recovery from
its 1998 financial crisis, China set about developing an Asian
trading bloc in partnership with Russia as an eventual
replacement for western export markets, and in 2001 the
Shanghai
Cooperation Organization was born. In the following year, her
gold policy also changed radically, when Chinese citizens were
allowed for the first time to buy gold and the Shanghai Gold
Exchange was set up to satisfy anticipated demand.
The fact that China permitted its
citizens to buy physical gold suggests that it had already
acquired a satisfactory holding.
Since 2002, it will have continued
to add to gold through mine and scrap supplies, which is
confirmed by the apparent absence of Chinese-refined 1 kilo bars
in the global vaulting system. Furthermore China takes in
gold doré from Asian and
African mines, which it also refines and probably adds to
government stockpiles.
Since 2002, the Chinese state has
almost certainly acquired by these means a further 5,000 tonnes
or more. Allowing the public to buy gold, as well as satisfying
the public's desire for owning it, also reduces the need for
currency intervention to stop the renminbi rising.
Therefore the Chinese state has
probably accumulated between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes since
1983, and has no need to acquire any more through market
purchases given her own refineries are supplying over 500 tonnes
per annum.
All other members of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO)
2 are gold-friendly or have increased their
gold reserves.
So the west having ditched gold for
its own paper will now find that gold has a new role as Asia's
ultimate money for over 3 billion people, or over 4 billion if
you include the South-East Asian and Pacific Rim countries for
which the SCO will be the dominant trading partner.
In this interview with GoldMoney's Alasdair Macleod
we discuss the latest
banker "suicides"
which have all of the
hallmarks of intelligence agency 'wet work'.
And Alasdair explains how
China could easily
have acquired 20,000 tons
of gold in recent decades
- and as SRS Rocco recently
pointed out -
another 10,000 tons of gold
in just the last
three years.
