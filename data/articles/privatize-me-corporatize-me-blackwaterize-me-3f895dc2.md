Thomas Paine saw the United States as an
"asylum for mankind." Sadly, under the political and social dominance of the
Social Darwinists, America has become more of an "asylum for the insane".
Torture, state-sponsored terrorism, illegal
wars, flagrant disregard for international law, tax decreases for the
wealthy, funding cuts for social safety net programs, government endorsed
racism, and diasporas in the aftermath of natural disasters are but a few
examples of the handiwork of the wealthy elite as they create a gross
perversion of Paine's vision of the US. Not to worry though. America's
patrician class now has its own private armies to protect its gold from the
proletariat they so graciously tolerate.
Recently, a company called Blackwater Lodge and Training Center, Inc.
("Blackwater") unleashed some attorneys on me for an editorial I published
on
Thomas Paine's Corner (my blog).
The article was by another writer and I had
published it under Fair Use since my blog generates no revenue.
Blackwater's legal representatives threatened me with a libel suit and
demanded that I depublish the article because it contained factual
inaccuracies. After some research I agreed with them and removed the article
from Thomas Paine's Corner.
However, in the course of my research, I made
some startling discoveries about the corporate mercenaries of Blackwater
and their disturbing relationship with the US government, which clearly
illustrates the threat America's parasitic aristocracy poses to the poor,
working and middle class of the world.
Martial law? Here?
As some have written and conjectured, the
Posse Comitatus Act (passed by Congress
during Reconstruction to prevent the government from using the military to
enforce civilian law) is in serious jeopardy of going the way of the
dinosaurs.
Signs of ill portent for the Act are its
statutory rather than Constitutional nature (leaving it much more vulnerable
to legislative changes), the federal government's use of the military to
fight the "War on Drugs" along America's borders, the precedent set by the
deployment of Blackwater's military proxies in New Orleans, and the Bush
Regime's repeated statement of its intention to rely heavily upon the
military in times of domestic crisis (i.e. during future hurricanes, a
potential outbreak of Avian Flu).
Unfortunately, Posse Comitatus affords
the American public about as much protection from martial law (at the whim
of our deranged president) as the levees provided New Orleans from the
ravages of Katrina.
Tell me sweet little
lies
In a time that is roughly comparable to that of the
Gilded Age, corporations and the
wealthy elite in the United States revel in their virtually unparalleled
power and wealth.
Labor unions, whose membership peaked at 35% of
the hourly wage force in the 1950's, now comprise less than 10% of the US
work force.
The wealth gap continues to widen to devastating
proportions as the middle class slowly disappears. Statistically,
unemployment is relatively low, but many of those who are working are
under-employed or working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. As the
wealthy elite continue to tighten the screws by raising regressive taxes and
lowering progressive taxes, lowering wages and benefits for the working
class, off-shoring jobs, and cutting social programs, the threat of riots
and social unrest becomes real.
Hence the Bush Regime's moves to lay the
foundation for declaring martial law and the rising fortunes of companies
providing private military forces, like Blackwater.
Blackwater provides an interesting solution to the Bush Regime's dilemma in
satiating its desire to employ martial law covertly. Despite their Social
Darwinism, America's leaders prefer to maintain the illusion of
"democracy and freedom" to keep the masses pacified. Just as they did in New
Orleans, the federal government can now utilize the paramilitary employees
of a company such as Blackwater to replace the overt presence of the US
military.
Rumsfeld, Chertoff, and company
demonstrated that they can deploy a domestic military presence "under the
radar", enabling them to side-step potential public backlash and legal
challenges.
Their reach is global
and they are not your average "civilians"
Here is what Blackwater has to say about itself
on its Website:
We have established a global presence and
provide training and operational solutions for the 21st century in
support of security and peace, and freedom and democracy everywhere.
Blackwater's global presence includes Iraq,
where the murder of four of their employees triggered the US military's
vengeful attack on Fallujah in which it committed heinous war crimes and
atrocities against hundreds of Iraqi civilians. Why the four Blackwater
contractors were near Fallujah the day of their deaths remains unclear.
The mainstream media, Blackwater and the US
government claim that they were on security detail protecting a food
delivery.
However, some suggest that the claims of
protecting a food caravan were a ruse to cover the fact that Blackwater
employees were completing a military operation. While the facts remain
unclear, it is certain that the mainstream media's portrayal of the
Blackwater victims as "civilian contractors" was significantly inaccurate.
According to the
Revolutionary Worker:
Soon after the four U.S. "civilian
contractors" died in Fallujah, it became obvious they weren't
"civilians" at all. All four were trained commandos - at least three had
years of experience in elite U.S. military units. They were working for
the private mercenary army called "Blackwater USA." All were heavily
armed. One carried a Department of Defense ID card.
Revolutionary Worker also indicated:
Increasingly, however, the main work of
Blackwater has been deploying its own mercenary army-- recruited from
elite U.S. military forces (especially from Navy SEALS and Marine
Recon), SWAT police forces, and international "soldiers of fortune." In
February it started training former Chilean commandos--some of whom
served under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet--for use in Iraq.
In August 2003, Blackwater was awarded a $21
million contract to supply security guards and two helicopters for Paul
Bremer III, head of the U.S. occupation in Iraq. Other Blackwater
operations in Iraq are merely described as full protective teams "for any
threat scenario."
In light of the International Convention Against the Recruitment, Use,
Financing and Training of Mercenaries of 1989, the US military and
Blackwater are careful to frame Blackwater's mission in Iraq as
security-related, but many of their employees are former military special
ops, often heavily armed and working in dangerous combat areas.
One would be foolish to believe that they would
not become embroiled in combat, and once they do, the question becomes,
"under the Geneva Convention, are they considered to be civilians or
soldiers?" One particular danger to Iraqi civilians is that Blackwater
"security" personnel are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military
Justice, so if they do commit a crime, there is very little accountability.
In the past, US mercenaries committing serious
crimes while on assignment in foreign nations simply lost their jobs as
punishment. US military and civilian courts lacked the jurisdiction, will,
or capacity to prosecute them. In 2000, the US Congress passed the
Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act
to provide a means for punishing civilian (and perhaps mercenary) personnel
assigned to the military for committing crimes in foreign nations.
Unfortunately, this law has yet to make much
impact.
Business as usual:
rewards for the elites and risks for the rest of us
Blackwater offers several advantages to the Bush Regime in its
imperialist endeavors. The military can lower "body counts" by employing
more private contractors and fewer military personnel.
Forces provided by Blackwater are less subject
to Congressional oversight and public scrutiny than the conventional
military. The availability of "guns for hire" negates the need for a highly
unpopular draft and helps fill in gaps left by military recruitment
shortages. As far back as May of 2004, the number of employees deployed to
Iraq by private security firms, including Blackwater, was 20,000.
20,000 is a very significant number. The US government is relying heavily on
private corporations like Blackwater, which demonstrates the Bush Regime's
fetish with privatization (to benefit the wealthy and corporations) even
extends to military operations. Unfortunately for the American people, as is
true with most privatization schemes, the cost is high to the poor and
working class.
A typical Blackwater contract soldier reportedly
makes six figures per year. Risking their lives side by side with people
making five times their salary is tough on the morale of US troops. The lure
of higher salaries naturally leads to a drain of talent from the US
military, particularly in special ops. While the US needs to end its
imperial conquest in Iraq and scale its military down significantly, we
still need a standing army (which is accountable to the representatives of
the people) of qualified, well-equipped individuals to provide for the
national defense.
Bypassing oversight by Congress by employing
private warriors, the Bush Regime is increasing its opportunities to
violate the Geneva Conventions and the US Constitution it so loathes. At the
same time, it exposes the American people to the dangers of the fickle
loyalties of avaricious corporations and their employees.
Since it began its involvement in the Bush Regime's "War
on Terror", Blackwater has been the defendant in at least two
lawsuits. Family members of the four Blackwater employees killed in Fallujah
are pursuing legal action against Blackwater for failure to properly equip
its employees. Blackwater and its aviation subsidiary also face litigation
stemming from the deaths of three US soldiers killed in a plane crash in
Afghanistan.
Read the following written (AFGHANISTAN:
Families Sue Private Contractor Over Soldiers' Deaths) by
Kristin Collins at and draw your own conclusions about our "friends" at
Blackwater:
According to the suit, the plane lacked even
the most basic safety equipment. It had no global positioning system or
radar. Its crew did not wear oxygen masks. And its two pilots, who had
been in Afghanistan only two weeks and had never flown the route before,
failed to take the basic step of filing a flight plan, leading to a
delay in finding the wreckage.
That delay could have been fatal for Miller, who apparently survived the
crash. When his body was found, it was clear he had gotten out of the
wreckage, smoked a cigarette, pulled out a sleeping bag and tried to
find shelter, said Robert Spohrer, a Florida lawyer who is
representing the families.
"These contractors are certainly in a
position to make a lot of money from the government," said Jeanette
McMahon, whose husband, Michael, died in the crash. "But they have
to take their jobs as seriously as the military."
Blackwater officials said Monday they had
nothing to do with the doomed flight.
The company's lawyer, Jonathan Stern of Washington, said in a statement
that the government contracted with Presidential Airways of Florida, not
Blackwater, to transport troops and cargo in and around Afghanistan.
But the company's Web site says Presidential
Airways is part of Blackwater's aviation services.
As you contemplate Blackwater and its
relationship with the US government, consider the inherent danger and
ethical conflicts involved in using public funds to engage a private
corporation (which exists to generate profit) to supplement (or perhaps to
supplant) the military in its role to "provide for the common defense".
Alarming issues leap to mind like a panther springing upon its prey.
More frightening still, the Social Darwinists sitting atop the food chain in
the wealthiest, most powerful nation in humanity's history now have access
to their own paramilitary force. They can unleash their private army on the
"unfitest" when the need arises, whether it be within America's borders or
otherwise. New Orleans is a prime example.
150 highly trained Blackwater quasi-military
professionals openly armed with assault weapons descended on a
tragedy-stricken city.
As hurricane victims taking necessities were
called "looters" and shoot to kill orders were in effect, those who value
property over people saw to it that their interests were well-protected.
Thankfully, Blackwater was there to protect the patrician class from the
"savages" from the Lower Ninth Ward who had the audacity to attempt
survival.
Blackwater is one of many symptoms of a very sick America.
Thomas Paine would feel deeply ashamed of
what has become of the nation he helped forge with his powerful writing.
