# Russia is On The Verge of Dealing a Massive Blow to The Petrodollar - 
De-Dollarization

Is the petrodollar monopoly about to be
shattered?
When U.S. politicians started slapping
economic sanctions on Russia, they probably never even imagined that
there might be serious consequences for the United States.
But now the
Russian media is reporting that the Russian Ministry of Finance is
getting ready to pull the trigger on a "de-dollarization" plan.
For decades, virtually all oil and natural gas around the world has been
bought and sold for U.S. dollars.
As I will explain below, this has been a
massive advantage for the U.S. economy. In recent years, there have been
rumblings by nations such as Russia and China about the need to change
to a new system, but nobody has really had a big reason to upset the
status quo.
However, that has now changed.
The
struggle over Ukraine has caused Russia
to completely reevaluate the financial relationship that it has with the
United States.
If it starts trading a lot of oil and natural gas for
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, that will be a massive blow for
the petrodollar, and it could end up dramatically changing the global
economic landscape.
The fact that the Russian government has
held a meeting to discuss "getting rid of the US dollar in Russian
export operations" should be front page news on every mainstream news
website in the United States. That is how big this is.
But instead, we
have heard nothing from the big mainstream news networks about this so
far.
Instead, we have only heard about this from Russian news sources
such as the
Voice of Russia...
Russian press reports that the country's
Ministry of Finance is ready to green-light a plan to radically
increase the role of the Russian ruble in export operations while
reducing the share of dollar-denominated transactions. Governmental
sources believe that the Russian banking sector is "ready to handle
the increased number of ruble-denominated transactions".
According to the Prime news agency, on
April 24th the government organized
a special
meeting dedicated to finding a solution for getting rid of the US
dollar in Russian export operations.
Top level experts from the energy
sector, banks and governmental agencies were summoned and a number
of measures were proposed as a response for American sanctions
against Russia.
The
"de-dollarization meeting" was chaired by First
Deputy Prime Minister of
the Russian Federation Igor Shuvalov, proving that Moscow is
very serious in its intention to stop using the dollar.
So will Russia go through with this?
After all, this wouldn't just be a slap in
the face. This would essentially be like slamming an economic fist into
our nose.
You see, Russia is not just a small player
when it comes to trading oil and natural gas. The truth is that Russia
is the
largest exporter of natural gas and the
second largest exporter of oil in the world.
If Russia starts asking for payment in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, that will essentially end the
monopoly of the petrodollar. In order to do this, Russia will need
trading partners willing to go along.
In the article quoted above, the Voice of
Russia listed Iran
and China as two nations that would potentially be willing to make
the switch...
Of course, the success of Moscow's
campaign to switch its trading to rubles or other regional
currencies will depend on the willingness of its trading partners to
get rid of the dollar.
Sources cited by Politonline.ru mentioned two
countries who would be willing to support Russia: Iran and China.
Given that Vladimir Putin will visit
Beijing on May 20, it can be speculated that the gas and oil
contracts that are going to be signed between Russia and China will
be denominated in rubles and yuan, not dollars.
And the reality of the matter is that China
has seemed ready to move away from the U.S. dollar for quite some time.
In a
previous article, it was included a quote from a French news source that
discussed how China's official news agency has even called for a "new
international reserve currency... to replace the dominant US dollar"...
For decades the US has benefited to the
tune of trillions of dollars-worth of free credit from the
greenback's role as the default global reserve unit.
But as the global economy trembled
before the prospect of a US default last month, only averted when
Washington reached a deal to raise its debt ceiling, China's
official Xinhua news agency called for a "de-Americanized" world.
It also urged the creation of a,
"new international reserve
currency... to replace the dominant US dollar".
So why is the
petrodollar so important?
Well, it creates a tremendous amount of
demand for the U.S. dollar all over the globe. Since everyone has
needed it to trade with one another, that has created an endless global
appetite for the currency. That has kept the value of the dollar
artificially high, and it has enabled us to import trillions of dollars
of super cheap products from other countries.
If other nations stopped using the dollar to
trade with one another, the value of the dollar would plummet
dramatically and we would have to pay much, much more for the trinkets
that we buy at the dollar store and Wal-Mart.
In addition, since the U.S. dollar is
essentially the de facto global currency, this has also increased demand
for our debt.
Major exporting nations such as China and Saudi Arabia
end up with giant piles of our dollars. Instead of just letting them sit
there and do nothing, those nations often reinvest their dollars into
securities that can rapidly be changed back into dollars if needed.
One of the most popular ways to do this has
been to invest those dollars in U.S. Treasuries. This has driven down
interest rates on U.S. debt over the years and has enabled the U.S.
government to borrow trillions upon trillions of dollars for next to
nothing.
But if the rest of the world starts moving
away from the U.S. dollar, all of this could change.
In order for our current standard of living
to continue, it is absolutely imperative that everyone else around the
globe continues to use our currency. So if Russia really does pull the
trigger on a "de-dollarization" strategy, that would be huge -
especially if the rest of the planet started following their lead.
The U.S. economy is already teetering on the
brink of another major downturn, and there are a whole host of
indications that big trouble is on the horizon.
Just about the last thing that we need right
now is for our petrodollar monopoly to be threatened.
It would be nice if things would calm down
in Ukraine and the relationship between the United States and Russia
could go back to normal. Sadly, that does not appear likely any time
soon.
In fact, the Ukrainian government has
already admitted that "we
are essentially at war", and on Tuesday six Ukrainian soldiers
were killed and eight were wounded in a convoy attack in eastern
Ukraine.
The regions in eastern Ukraine that have
just declared independence have given the government in Kiev until
Wednesday to pull their forces out of eastern Ukraine or else face war.
If a full blown civil war does erupt in
Ukraine, it is going to take this crisis to a completely new level.
Unfortunately, most Americans are incredibly
apathetic at this point and know very little about what is going on. But in the end, this could have dramatic
implications for all of us...
