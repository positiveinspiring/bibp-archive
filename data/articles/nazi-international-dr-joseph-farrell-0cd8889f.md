# Nazi International - Dr. Joseph Farrell

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_germany04.htm

Introduction
Bill Ryan (BR): ...So our job is to help you get your
information out to the maximum amount of people.
Joseph Farrell (JF): Okay.
BR: And the people who do watch this information are a very
eclectic bunch. Weve got 16-year-old kids whove just woken up last
month saying: Whats going on around here? Tell me. Tell me. And then
weve got seasoned researchers like yourself, and even insiders
themselves, who watch our videos to get a feel for whats really going
on.
JF: Okay.
BR: And so, one of the reasons why we wanted to talk to you was because
youre a very cogent, lucid and articulate presenter of some very
difficult information. Im sure other people have told you that as well,
but we recognize that.
JF: Okay.
BR: And we apologize for putting you under the camera here, to the
extent that you dont have your slide slow. [Farrell laughs]. You dont
have any prompts and you dont have any notes.
JF: Ill do shadows. [laughs]
BR: The feeling we had about you is that you have a very good grasp of
your information, and we respect that as well. So here we go. Were
rolling.
Start of interview
So... Im Bill Ryan from Project Camelot. Im here with my colleague
Kerry Cassidy and were delighted to also be here with Joseph Farrell.
And off camera just a few moments ago I checked that it was okay to call
you Joe...
JF: Oh, absolutely.
BR: ...cause were among friends here, and that makes me feel a little
bit more relaxed. You may be wondering, and some of our viewers may be
wondering how come this is Bill here whos doing this interview. And
just as a little bit of a personal introduction about myself, and also
maybe to some of our newer viewers, Im... If we were the real X-Files,
I would actually be Scully. [laughter] Okay? Meaning, Im the one whos
slightly more scientific, slightly more skeptical, slightly more
cautious...
JF: Right.
BR: ...and this is why, between us, many people feel, and we feel
ourselves, that we make quite a good team. So I have a math and physics
background.
JF: Okay.
BR: I tend not to leap to wild conclusions, but at the same time Im
very happy to think out of the box...
JF: Sure.
BR: ...as I strongly suspect you do as well.
JF: Right.
BR: And one of the reasons why we really wanted to talk to you besides
the very high professional quality of your presentation on various
interviews that we listened to, to prepare ourselves for this - is that
the pieces of the jigsaw that you have collected through your diligent
research seem to us to be essential understanding for anyone who really
wants to know whats going on today in geopolitics, in terms of black
science, maybe even in terms of global agenda, whos running the show,
how it all started, where it all started, and when it all started.
JF: Okay.
BR: And for the benefit of some of our viewers who may not know who you
are...
JF: Okay. [laughs]
BR: ...despite that introduction, give us your elevator speech about:
Who is Joe Farrell? And how did you come to do what youre doing right
now?
JF: Well, Cliff Notes version: My father was an engineer, so I kind of
grew up in a household where science was always kind of a main thing to
be stressed, and Ive always been, you know, individually interested in
it. For quite a long period when I was a child, and all through high
school later on, I wanted to be a physicist. And then, my senior year I
got senioritis, Im afraid, and wimped out of calculus and selected
music theory as my alternative study, but [laughs] that proved to be
almost as difficult, if not more so.
So I was also a musician and I got into music. And then when I was in
college I took philosophy and that diverted me even further away from my
original goal, into philosophy and ancient texts. Ive also always been
interested in history and ancient things, and mysteries, and so on and
so forth. So I did my Ph.D. in England and then taught college for a
number of years.
BR: In Oxford? Were you in Oxford?
JF: No, no. I wasnt a professor at all at Oxford. I just did my Ph.D.
there. I actually taught college in Oklahoma. It was mostly philosophy
and history, but I did do an inter-disciplinary seminar at one period of
time. That was a team-taught seminar, and the way the other professor
and I had to kind of divvy up the various disciplines that we were
trying to pull together... Well, she was a biologist so she handled
certain things, and I got physics because thats always been kind of a
hobby even though I abandoned the professional pursuit of it, so...
We also discovered we had a common interest, as it were, in the esoteric
and alternative things, and I presented some of my Pyramid ideas to her
and she says: Oh, youve got to do that for the class. So I did it for
the class and they kind of really liked it, much to my surprise.
After I quit college teaching I decided: Well, you know I might as well
bite the bullet and write some of my crazy ideas down. So thats kind of
[laughs] how I got started in all of this. Thats how it came about.
BR: So youre quite a polymath.
JF: Ah... I have a lot of interests. Yeah. I wouldnt say polymath, but,
yeah, Ive got a broad spectrum of interests. [laughs]
BR: Youve already answered one of my questions, which is how come it
appears evidently that you have such a grasp of the physics which your
research has led you to be entangled with, if I can use that word.
JF: Oh yeah. Well, when I was growing up I was the quintessential nerd.
I mean, fun for me when I was a boy was playing with my daddys slide
rule, you know? [laughs] So that kind of gives you the idea of what kind
of person... Ive always been a reader and to this day I still like to
try and find physics papers online and pull em up and read em, and see
whats going on. So thats kind of what I am.
BR: Well good for you because it sounds like, from what we can gather,
having talked to mutual colleagues such as
Richard Hoagland...
JF: Right.
BR: ...and
Jim Marrs, who we interviewed just this morning, is that
youre providing a real service in the information chain, as it were, in
terms of providing researchers - who are trying their best to assemble a
big picture - with some specific drilled-down components that you seem
eminently qualified to have stumbled across. Or perhaps that sounds too
clumsy. Actually, maybe youve been going after them very deliberately
ever since you realized that there was something to go after.
JF: Maybe.
BR: Do you think that that is correct?
JF: Maybe somewhere between the two. One of the things that always
struck me... My academic background is actually in theology, and it
always struck me that many of the methods that theologians use are very
similar, in some respects, to methods that physicists use. And that may
sound wildly contradictory to what most people would think.
But in looking at ancient texts, particularly philosophical texts, it
always struck me that I was looking at a kind of a topological metaphor
rather than specifically a metaphysical text. And the further I went
back, the more apparent that metaphor became, to the point that it even
became possible to notate certain concepts in text with the actual
notation conventions of topology.
So I thought, well, you know: Thats kind of wild! [laughs] So I didnt
share it. Doing the Ph.D., I didnt share that idea with anybody, you
know. But after I quit college teaching I began to look at texts that
way, and to see... And I had done it privately. Im not saying that, you
know, all of a sudden I decided to do this. Id been doing it privately
for a number of years and keeping little notebooks of it. But yeah. It
was kind of half-accident, and kind of an on-going interest. So
somewhere between the two.
BR: But theres something that must have got you started specifically on
the treasure-trail that led you to putting together a lot of the
sub-jigsaw that was: What were the Nazis really doing before and during
World War Two...
JF: Right.
BR: ...that nobody else seems to have really realized? What was it that
led you in that direction? What were the first things you found?
JF: Well, the thing that always struck me that I dont think has... And
I dont even include myself in this category. The thing that has always
struck me about what kind of research the Nazis were doing is, on the
one hand you have a definite esoteric, occult influence and interest
that midwifes the Nazi Party into existence. You have a definite
esoteric and occult influence at work after the Nazis take power.
And, you know, one of the things I like to point out is that the Nazi
State with the SS and Heinrich Himmler, when he creates the Ahnenerbe
Dienst [ed. note: Ahnenerbe Service] the so-called Ancestral Research
Bureau...
If you go to the Nuremberg Tribunals and pull up the brief - you have to
kind of dig for it but you can eventually find it - its a short little
statement, declaration, that establishes this thing. But one of the
things that he puts in as one of the purposes for this department is
that it is to investigate all of these areas for their potential
military application. Okay?
So we have that influence at work. And then, on the other hand, as you
know, being mathematics and physics background, you have during that
period of - oh, say 1920 up to about 1931, 32 - you have this spate of
publications in Germany of various Unified Field Theories: Kaluza,
Einstein, Eddington, and so on and so forth. So you have that kind of
scientific ferment at work.
And then of course you add Gabriel Kron into the mix, a Hungarian
fellow, electrical engineer who says: Hey! You know, he wins a prize at
the University of Li√®ge in Belgium for a paper in which he says: Well,
we electrical engineers notice all of these anomalies in large rotating
electrical systems, and we can explain those anomalies by appealing to
these higher-dimensional physics Unified Field Theories.
So in other words, if you stop and think of the implications of what he
said, the technology of electrical circuitry, circa 1935, is producing
anomalies only explainable by these higher-dimensional mathematical /
physics theories. Hes telling you, in other words: These theories are
engineer-able. They may be incomplete in the theoretical sense, but
theyre nonetheless engineer-able theories. And thats an important
statement.
BR: Which is highly significant because hes marrying two totally
different worlds.
JF: Oh yes. Absolutely. Yes.
BR: Engineering in the practical; and the abstruse in the mathematical.
JF: Absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, one of the things that struck
me... Ive just acquired some of Krons papers. I went out and bought
one of his books, a little old Dover book publication. But what he does
is, he takes the tensor calculus and uses it as a way of analyzing
electrical machines.
BR: Now this is Einsteins tensor calculus from his 1928 Unified Field
paper?
JF: Yeah. This is... Right. And one of the things specifically that
youll notice in Kron - although he doesnt come right out and tell you:
Im now going to show you how torsion works - is he appeals to that very
concept.
So youve got these two very different things going on as kind of an
intellectual ferment in Germany at the time. Youve got the esoteric and
occult interest, and you have this very abstruse theoretical and
engineering interest.
Now, Ive always suspected that there is some sort of connection between
the two. And this is kind of what got me interested in the whole Bell
story, because the department of the German government that is
conducting all of this very exotic research is precisely the SS.
BR: What year are we talking about now?
JF: Thats another good question. the Bell project itself, I think you
can make a kind of a case, actually has its conceptual kind of
proof-of-concept stage beginnings before the Nazis take power, and may
have been as early as circa 1924 and 25.
BR: That early!?
JF: That early. The reason that I say that is in one of my books I
reproduce this little, oh, kind of a two-column filler article that ran
in the Frankfurter Allgameine Zeitung, I think it was, but it was
written by none other than Dr. Walther Gerlach.
Now Walther Gerlach, you know, hes one of the most famous physicists at
that time of history. Hes a Nobel Prize winner, you know... the famous
Stern-Gerlach experiment.
I thought: Well whoa! Because what hes talking about in this article is
the possibility of the transmutation of elements, specifically in regard
to mercury-to-gold, and hes calling it a new alchemy. And that just
really brought me up short. Because you know, this is, number one,
before the discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn. Okay? So hes got
some very different concept in his head.
BR: Hes a smart guy, hes not a...
JF: [laughs] Hes a very smart guy! Yeah. This is not a second-stringer,
you know. And when he uses this word alchemy, its crystal clear. I even
reproduced the original German article and then translated it, so you
know that Im not making this stuff up, folks.
BR: Its the same word in German, isnt it?
JF: Oh yeah. Alchemy. You can see it right there in an article. So he
writes this article and then, its very clear, he makes a kind of a
final little statement, that, you know: This should be investigated
further and to do so its going to - hint, hint - require a lot of money.
[laughs] So this is kind of the typical scientists appeal to the
government. All right?
BR: Okay.
JF: Well, the reason I think that the project may have begun at this
time is because it is precisely Dr. Walther Gerlach who is the project
head of the Bellfor the Nazis.
BR: Okay. Now, Joe, I wonder if I could stop you here, because what
weve got here is weve got the first ten minutes of whats sounding
like a really interesting movie where [Farrell laughs] no ones quite
sure whats going on here...
JF: Yeah.
BR: ...but theyre interested.
JF: Okay.
BR: Now, for our viewers, Okay? Weve talked about Einstein; tensor
calculus - something that sounds very abstrusely mathematical that...
JF: It is! [laughs]
BR: ...no one will understand; the Nazis; and something called the Bell.
So whats the plot-line here? Why should anyone...
JF: Pay attention to this?
BR: ...care about this extraordinary story?
JF: All right. Very simple. Its my belief... Just to give you kind of a
very short Cliff Notes answer, its my belief, number one, that the Nazi
atom bomb project was successful. Now, what Im going to do is simply ask
your viewers to accept that as kind of a given for the sake of
argument so that I can kind of set the context. Okay?
If you look at the project classification of the Bell, the Nazis
classified it as kriegsentscheidend - [ed. note: war decisive]. In other
words, within the classification system of the Third Reich, the Bell was
classified absolutely uniquely and at the very pinnacle of the system,
and it is the ONLY project in Nazi Germany to be given that specific
classification. In other words, higher than the atom bomb. Okay?
So in other words, to the Nazis the atom bomb is, you know, already kind
of old stuff. [laughs] Okay? So that gives an indicator of what the
significance is. But if you look at the physics that theyre trying to
investigate, I believe theyre investigating it for three things - for the
purposes of achieving three things.
Number one, they want to free Germany from energy dependence on foreign
powers and foreign oil. So, in other words, theyre investigating the
so-called zero point energy. Okay?
Number two, the same sort of physics they have seen is kind of a gateway
or window into advanced field propulsion, or antigravity if you want to
call it that.
And the third thing of course, Nazis being Nazis, is that they want to
engineer this physics for a weapon. And of course were dealing now with
the physics that, again, can engineer the fabric of space-time, locally.
BR: Okay. Now, just once again to summarize this before we go into even
more detail.
JF: Sure.
BR: What youre referring to here is, youve picked up the research line
that was started by...
JF: Igor Witkowski.
BR: ...Nick Cook and Igor Witkowski. This thing that seems to have been
called... well, for lack of a better word The Nazi Bell. We dont know
what they called it, do we?
JF: Well, actually they did call it Die Glocke.
BR: Die Glocke.
JF: And they had another nickname for it: Der Bienenstock
- the beehive...
BR: The beehive.
JF: ...because of the sound it made. But one of the actual project code
names was Projekt Cronos, or Project Time. Now, many people leap to the
conclusion that well, theyre trying to build a time machine. Well, no.
Thats... Time is involved because, again, youre trying to use torsion
to tap into the ability to manipulate the fabric of space-time.
BR: Whats torsion?
JF: All right.
Torsion. The way I like to illustrate it very simply is:
If you take a soda can and empty the soda out of it and then wring it
like a dishrag, youve got that counter-rotating motion, and its going
to spiral and fold and pleat that can, and then draw the ends of the can
closer together. So that kind of is my simplistic illustration of what
torsion does. And the can itself would represent space-time, okay?
Now, what theyre doing... I think ultimately, for the Nazis, the
purpose of this is they want to weaponize it. And of course - and I say
this over and over again in my interviews - if youre dealing with a
technology that has the potential to engineer space-time, that means
that if you weaponize that, potentially you have a weapon that would
make a hydrogen bomb look like a firecracker.
Its truly planet-busting stuff if youve got the proper engineering
behind it and, you know, develop appropriate power systems and so on.
Which again... one and the same thing will lead to zero-point energy, so
theres your power, [laughs] you know?
BR: And therere some very smart scientists in that time.
JF: Oh yes! Absolutely.
BR: One might actually say the worlds finest, would you say?
JF: I would say so. And again, you know, this is why I kind of prefaced
my remarks by mentioning the atom bomb, because the kind of the post-war
Allied legend, as I like to call it, is of course the Germans were a
bunch of nuclear bunglers, you know. And they didnt have enough
manpower. And they didnt have enough money, you know, and all of this
happy nonsense that you hear in the textbooks.
Well, to me this story really doesnt make much sense. And youre right.
Theyve got Heisenberg. Theyve got Hartek. I mean, these people are not
second-stringers at all. So yeah, what the Germans are doing... And I
want to emphasize here the importance of why Nazism would be the
ideological cauldron for this, because Nazism of course had banned
Jewish physics. In other words: Relativity.
And they even had
ideological difficulties with aspects of
quantum mechanics because it
was too statistical. It was too probabilistic. It wasnt deterministic
enough for some of the Nazi ideologues.
But what is implied by this in the standard history is that within Nazi
Germany you have an absolute stamping out of the scientific method and a
dead-ending of physics. But I think if you look now, a hundred years
after Relativity, we see precisely that physics has dead-ended. We have
this kind of dogma in place now.
What I think Nazism really did is it freed those people in a certain way
to think outside the box, and all of that outside-the-box thinking took
place inside the confines of the SS. And the signal event that kicks all
this loose now in modern times - the reason were finding out about it - is
precisely German Reunification. Why?
BR: Right.
JF: Because when the Eastern Zone is basically annexed in a shotgun
wedding by West Germany... and thats exactly how I would describe it.
When that happens, all of those old SS installations in the Eastern
Zone - some of which the Soviets didnt even get into, you know. The SS
blew them up and the Soviets never bothered to go into them. The Germans
went back in there and looked at all this stuff, and it wasnt showing
up on any radar screen connected with rockets or jet aircraft or poison
gas, you know, any of the other stuff that they were doing. And so they
began to wonder: Well, whats going on here?
And then of course Igor finds that very strange henge-like structure
there in Ludwikowice, I think in Poland, which used to be Ludwigsdorf,
and hes wondering: What is this? [laughs] You know? Why is this here?
And of course this kicks loose the spate of declassification. This kicks
loose a bunch of people coming forward from the old Eastern Zone, now
able to talk about what they saw, what they observed. So this has kicked
loose a fantastic amount of information.
BR: Its very interesting what you are saying about the... Let me
rephrase what youre saying: The crucible of the states support and the
states agenda was a perfect support system for a scientist who wanted
the funding and the motivation...
JF: And to think outside the box.
BR: ...and all the resources to go and play with his toys and to do what
all scientists really want to do, which is to invent something wild...
JF: [laughs] Yes! Exactly!
BR: ...that works.
JF: Thats exactly right.
BR: And what some of our listeners will already be thinking is, like...
theyll be thinking: Wait a minute! This is whats happening in Los
Alamos and Hughes and Sandia and Bell Labs right now.
JF: Uh huh! Yes. Thats right. Yes!
BR: At a different time and in a different Reich - [Farrell laughs]
- which
is what Jim Marrs would say.
JF: Yeah. I wouldnt have much of an argument with him either! [laughs]
BR: But what I also think youre saying, at the risk of putting words
into your mouth, is that if we want to understand that stuff that I just
mentioned, then we need to go back to exactly this paper trail that
youve been following, because what were seeing nowadays is the progeny
of that. Is that correct?
JF: Yeah. Nazi Germany is, you know, its really a weird state when you
examine the scientific implications of it because...
Let me go back to that SS department that Himmler sets up. Okay, youre
going to go out there and youre going to research the Aryan heritage
- if we
look at the Nazi state and we go back to what Himmler sets up with this
department - and he says: All right. Go out and investigate all of the
aspects of the ancient Aryan heritage. But the mission brief is broad
enough that he gives them.
Basically you have a department of the Nazi state created specifically
for the purpose to investigate the esoteric, the occult, the hermetic,
whatever you want to call all of this ancient lore, okay? For the
specific purpose of military application.
BR: This again sounds eerily reminiscent of what we hear coming out of
certain places in America right now.
JF: Yeah! Right. But here, what Im emphasizing here, and what I want to
kind of tie into what you said, is that this is the first time in modern
history that a major world power has invested serious financial and
personnel resources to do this. And its very, very clear, you know, in
Nazi Germanys case. So we have this cauldron, this crucible that, you
know...
I take kind of almost diametrically the opposite tack that a standard
academic historian would give you of this Aryan physics. We know what
the failures are. I mean, theyre palpable. Theyre blatant. But the
reason we dont know about the successes, and the reason that were only
hearing about them now, is not only German Reunification but precisely
because that crucible was in the SS. It was all classified. It was also
deeply black.
But yeah, by freeing them from so-called Jewish physics, what theyre
really saying is: We want you to think outside the box. We want you to
come up with a completely different paradigm of physics. And if its
engineer-able, [claps hands] go do it.
BR: Okay. Now, interestingly enough, just last week we spoke with
Peter Levenda. Do you know him and his work?
JF: Oh yes. Yeah. I know Peter.
BR: We were delighted to talk with him and, of course, hes somebody
who...
JF: Oh yes.
BR: ...is a document researcher like yourself. And he described to us
how he went to the very famous archivist, Dr. Wolfe...
JF: Okay. Yes.
BR: ...who showed him the archives of the SS Ahnenerbe.
JF: Oh boy! [laughs]
BR: And his words were that his jaw dropped. He never knew such a thing
existed. Its really interesting to us that youve been down that same
rabbit-hole. And what Id love to ask you about - if this doesnt deviate
from your thought-line here - is: What is the connection between this
hard, but brilliant and out-of-the-box physics, with the occult?
JF: I think... Again, if you go back to the remarks I began with, I
think if you go far enough back and look at certain types of texts, for
example, the Hermetica, okay? And read them without the standard
academic approach with metaphysics eyeglasses on, and read them rather
as a topologist - as a mathematician - would read these texts, or as even a
materials engineer, you know, might read these texts, what pops out of
these things is a profound metaphor of a physical medium that creates
information, and thats a very modern idea.
In fact, its so modern, you
know, it starts popping up in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and begins
to kind of spread from there. All of this stuff is popping out of the
Soviet Union.
So in other words, way back when - if we go back to
the Hermetica - here
were dealing with a text approximately, oh give or take, you know,
2,000 years old, so in others words... But its an Egyptian text even
though its written in Greek. Its provenance is clearly Egyptian, okay?
So this is very old and yet it contains this profoundly sophisticated
physics metaphor.
Thats what really popped out at me, you know, when I was reading these
texts. It wasnt that I was supposed to be looking and seeing Platonic
Universals, you know, the chair-of-all-chairs and the
horse-of-all-horses. No. None of that was what was popping out at me.
What Platos talking about is
topology. Hes talking about common
surfaces with common forms, okay? So Im looking at this, and then Im
looking at the Nazis, and theyre coming up with these theories
essentially in the 20s and 30s that are looking at the physical medium
as an engineer-able reality. In other words, in a certain sense, as an
information-creating medium. So... And again, the key to creating stable
information is rotation, okay? Torsion, and so on and so forth.
So Im thinking: Well, this appears to be precisely what we see going on
with this Bell project. They are somehow pursuing this idea of physics.
And one of the things that leapt out at me that kind of made this
connection very clear is...
In my book,
The Philosophers Stone, I refer to a fellow by the name of
Himmlers Rasputin - if you can imagine [laughs] Heinrich Himmler having
a personal Rasputin! Well this guys name is
Karl Maria Wiligut. Okay?
He has a number of aliases that he wrote esoteric treatises under. But
his basic conception is that the whole universe arises out of a tension
between two counter-rotating spirals which create the World Egg. Okay?
And when I saw that I thought: Oh boy! Because of course in the Bell,
you know - which I rationalize as basically a kind of hyper-dimensional
torsion physics device - youve got these two counter-rotating drums into
which theyre putting this high-density liquid, which I think may have
even incorporated an isomer as one of its components. And of course an
isomer is one of these high-spin isotopes, that if you de-excite it, it
will release massive amounts of energy.
Well, youve got these two counter-rotating drums, and Im thinking:
Well, heres the physics that theyre doing, and weve got these two
counter-rotating things. And over here, Himmlers Rasputin is saying:
Well, this is all coming out of two counter-rotating systems. You know?
So I think, clearly, you had an ideological culture in the SS that,
rather than inhibiting scientific progress, really kind of forced them
to pursue all of this
higher-dimensional physics.
BR: It actually gave them an inspirational boost.
JF: Yes. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, the kind of... the final nail in
the coffin, as far as Im concerned is, if you look at the swastika
itself, you know, and view that as not so much the corporate logo of the
Nazi Party but as an ideogram of this whole physics idea...
BR: It looks like a
vector diagram.
JF: Yeah. It looks like a vector diagram. Exactly! You know, youve got
a subsystem of rotation, youve got a subsystem of stress, and you throw
them together and twist that thing, and theres your parallel transports
in the tensor calculus... and voila, you know, [laughs] youre on your
way.
Kerry Cassidy (KC): In a sense, that symbol came out of India.
JF: Oh sure. Yeah.
KC: They actually went back to the original meaning of the symbol, and
picked up on it because it was supposed to have been...
JF: Yes. Bingo. Bingo! Exactly! And, you know, if you kind of can
imagine Walther Gerlach being challenged, you know. Lets assume the
projects underway when the Nazis take power. Gerlach got his wish. He
got funding from the Weimar government, and hes doing his spin
experiments, okay? He was fascinated with spin and magnetic resonance
and gravitation, you know. He corresponded with the Austrian physicist,
Thirring. You know, the
Lense-Thirring Effect. Satellite drag and all
this, you know. This was his bag.
So imagine the Nazis coming in and saying: Well, Professor Doktor
Gerlach, were going to shut your project down. It looks too suspicious
to us. Its dealing in areas we dont want to deal with. Its not part
of our ideology. Well, all Gerlach has to do is say: Herr Himmler, its
right there on your armband. Hes already sold them, in a certain sense!
[Bill laughs]
And youre right. Because the other thing about the Bell that I should
mention in this context with India is that this Xerum 525 that theyre
putting inside this device and spinning up... Well, number one, its a
liquid. Number two, its of heavy density. Number three, its of a kind
of a maroonish-violet color, okay? Very heavy.
So Im thinking: A liquid metal. Mercury. So probably mercury is one
thing. And theres your connection to India. Because of course as you
know, in the
Vimana texts you have references to mercury vortexes. And,
just to kind of make a final nail in the coffin, mercurys kind of an
ideal candidate if youre going to use plasmas in this thing.
And again, you know, you have astrophysicists in Germany - Houtermans - looking
at the sun thinking: Okay, weve got nuclear fusion up there. And
theyve already noticed the sun rotates but the plasma is rotating at
different velocities, so youve got this differential rotation they
call it, but thats just a fancy word for, you know, its rotating at
different velocities. And theyre putting all this together in this
device.
KC: What about the Vimanas? You know, what was in essence flying saucers
way back when? Do you think that they might have gotten the idea there?
JF: From those ancient texts? Let me put it this way: I dont think its
even necessary to say that that might have been a motivation. However,
within the culture of the SS that is conducting this research, youre
going to have one department,
the Ahnenerbe, reading these texts and
taking them to the scientists to analyze. And the scientists are going
to look at these things and say: Oh, isnt that interesting?
Because over here Professor Doctor Gerlach has been studying this. He
won a Nobel Prize for examining aspects of this type of physics, and
hes been investigating and researching ever since. And theyre putting
these two things together. I think thats whats happening in Nazi
Germany. Theyre doing the first attempt, in a certain sense, to go back
at these ancient texts and say they contain a scientific metaphor, and
therefore a technology. And we have these papers now that we can see
this. Lets try and reconstruct it.
This is a vital thing because that means they have also seen - and this
is, again, a part of Nazi ideological belief - that there was a very
sophisticated ancient civilization. So in another sense then, yeah,
theyre trying to reconstruct this stuff. In that sense theyre kind of
a resurrection of Atlantis.
BR: Hmm.
KC: Then are they looking at the Egyptian pyramids and the Sumerian
seals
JF: Theyre looking at everything. [laughs]
KC:
and theyre getting all kinds of clues.
JF: Oh yeah! Absolutely they are, you know
BR: Because at exactly the same time as this they were mounting
expeditions all over the world to try and get hold of
JF: Oh yes.
BR:
anything they could get a hold of.
JF: Oh yes.
BR: That would give them clues to all of this, right?
JF: Well, in this regard, this idea of an ancient civilization in trying
to get clues into it; youre familiar with the 38-39 Schafer expedition
to Tibet.
BR: Yes.
JF: Okay. Well, Himmler was a personal sponsor of this. What I find
interesting is that, in spite of the heavy influence of the British Raj
in Tibet, the Nazis not only were able to gain entry into the Potala
from the regions. They came out of Tibet with an entire copy - as Peter Levendas research establishes
- an entire copy of the Kangschur; this
ancient Tibetan epic which is supposed to be about this very
sophisticated ancient civilization. And they make it back to Germany
with this.
BR: And they knew its importance.
JF: Oh yes absolutely they did, absolutely they did.
KC: So some of their technology could have come from Tibet as well?
JF: I think some of their technology has to... Some of their thinking
has to come from looking at these texts and looking at all of these very
abstruse ideas in physics and putting them together because they fit so
snuggly at places at times that it really is astonishing. You know, I
didnt dare write about any of this when I was a professor. [laughs]
Thats why I wait until after I get out of there. Now Ill write it
down.
BR: The least one can say about it is that this is all the work of
intuitive genius.
JF: Yes, I
BR: Thats the least one can say.
JF: Thats the least that one can say. And again, the fact that we have
an organized department of the government - and a secret one at that - doing
this, that means its organized.
BR: Yup!
JF: And that, to me, implies that - as youre implying - that to me
indicates that there is some deliberation being taken in thinking and
rationalizing all of this out.
BR: Okay. Now let me just dispose of one question here that our viewers
will want me to ask.
JF: Sure. [laughs]
BR: Actually, and secretly, I want to ask it myself too. This is the
claimed inference of
the Vril Society; those young girls who were
channeling, remote viewing, accessing clairvoyant information - whatever
you want to call it.
JF: Okay.
BR: Thats been much vaunted
JF: Yes.
BR:
by theorists who claim that they were accessing information that
may have come from other realms or other planets or whatever.
JF: Right.
BR: Whats your take on that?
JF: I dont base my analysis of the Bell Project, or anything like that,
on channeled information or on Neo-Nazi sources. My problem with this
story is precisely those two things. That it comes, first of all, from a
source that is anecdotal and, secondly, that the ultimate source thats
putting it out has some very shady kind of Neo-Nazi ties, okay?
And theres no other corroboration of it other than the fact that we
know that something called the Vril Society did exist, and we know it
because it was the German rocket scientist Willy Ley that first
mentioned it when he came over to this country to escape the Nazis.
BR: Mm-hm.
JF: Okay. So we know that that society existed. We dont know much about
it. They did publish a small thin little brochure in Berlin prior to the
war. I havent been able to get a hold of it. I dont know what its
contents are. So, as far as Im concerned, this is a story that, number
one, has kind of a suspect origin and, number two, I havent been able
to find anything other than this story to corroborate that the Nazis
were doing this.
I do know that the Ahnenerbe is doing research that we would now
consider paranormal or psychic or remote viewing or what have you.
Certainly they were. So youve got a general context in which something
like that might have taken place, but they are alleging that this took
place toward the end - in fact in some cases during World War One and
toward the end of World War One - long before the Nazis are even on the
scene.
BR: I thought it was in the twenties.
JF: No. I think one of these was 1916 and another one was in 19
- and
again, I may be mistaken - 1919 I think, close to Berchtesgarten, which is
another unusual little coincidence [laughs] in this story, but...
KC: But did you investigate the remote viewing, like the origins of
remote viewing, in the Nazi
JF: No, no I havent. Thats an aspect of the story I think again that
is going to come out eventually. The problem now is getting... There are
massive amounts of Ahnenerbe documents in the US national archives, but
many of them are still unavailable, so the problem is being able to tell
a complete story. You see, thats the whole problem here. Its not that
I dont think that there is one but right now all we have with the Vril
Society is a kind of a general kind of corroboration of a context.
BR: Yes. And presumably youre also sort of invoking Occams Razor by
saying its not necessary to
JF: To go there.
BR: I understand that.
JF: Exactly. Its not necessary because you have another occult
influence at work already within the SS that has a specifically detailed
conceptual relationship to the physics being investigated with the Bell
and thats this guy Wiligut.
BR: Yeah.
JF: Right. So you really dont even need to go there. It would be kind
of nice icing on the cake, you know, if they figured out: Well,
consciousness plays a role in this too and were going to investigate
that. Well if theyre rationalizing things to that extent, yeah, then
were in even deeper trouble. [laughs]
BR: Okay. Now after all those fascinating set-ups
JF: Okay. [laughs]
BR:
our viewers here, who are thinking this sounds like a detective
story; this sounds like Columbo...
JF: Or a bad Oliver B movie. [laughs]
BR: What was the Bell? What were they trying to do? And what is known
what is not known what is theorized and why is this important?
JF: Okay, let me give you the basic data points and then Ill give you
how I kind of rationalize them. My rationalization of it is a bit
different that Igor Witkowski and Nick Cook although I kind of build on
some aspects of their analysis.
First of all
its a device, its bell shaped, it stands about twelve to
fifteen feet high, nine to twelve feet wide. Its either cased in a kind
of a ceramic metal or just plain old ceramic. Its got heavy duty
electrical port cable - electrical cabling ports - around the device.
Inside the device there are two counter rotating drums - and I want to be
clear here. The data that we have does not specify the internal
configuration of those drums within the Bell. These two counter rotating
drums had a 'serum' - this Xerum 525 (see
Hunt for Zero Point) I mentioned earlier
- the heavy maroonish-red, probably mercury, compound.
It is cryogenically cooled either by liquid oxygen or liquid nitrogen
and it is close to an electrical power plant and sounds like a beehive
Okay? The electrical power plant is kind of to put an hyperbole on it
near yards away from the installations that the Bell is being tested in
all right?
BR: The kind of hum you get from a high voltage generator.
JF: Yes. Okay. Now lets put all these things... Those are the data
points, and the
BR: And this is known how?
JF: This is known by an SS general by the name of Jakob Sporrenberg who
was part of this project because he was the general that was tasked, at
the end of the war, to go in and murder sixty of the scientists involved
with the project.
BR: Hm.
JF: In other words the Nazis want to keep this thing absolutely quiet.
BR: I didnt know that.
JF: Oh yeah, thats how all this comes out. Hes tried for that crime by
a Polish War Crimes Tribunal because, of course, Poland slid westward
and took over parts of Pomeranian Silesia that were formerly German
provinces. And the Bell was tested in that part of Germany that then
became Poland after the war.
So Poland assumed jurisdiction over this man for that crime and we know
it by the affidavit that he gave at that war crimes trial, okay? But
its important again to realize, its after the collapse of the iron
curtain, its after the collapse of the east German state and basically
the shotgun wedding that was had in 1989, that all of this comes out.
Now, Sporrenberg also describes the effect of the device on plants.
Plants exposed to the field of this thing when it was operating would
decay to a kind of a brownish grey goo within a matter of either hours
or weeks, this would vary.
BR: Theyd come apart.
JF: Yes. Theyd just literally fall apart, just blugh, and they would do
so without putrefaction. The first time it was tested apparently the
Germans had not done something correctly and seven of the original
scientists of the project were killed when it was tested the first time.
Later on, apparently, they learned how to kind of control some of these
deadly effects a little bit more reasonably.
But those are the data points. And one little final bit of information - a
final bit of data point... When it was tested underground it had to be
tested in a room lined with ceramic bricks over which were placed rubber
mats. After each test concentration camp victims would come in, remove
the rubber mats, burn the mats and then scrub down the ceramic bricks
with brine - okay? That had to be done for some reason after each test.
BR: Radioactivity?
JF: Yes I think so, I think so. Again... and Im mentioning that because
its a crucial data point. Then, when it was tested outside, it was
tested apparently inside this henge-like structure that is near all of
these strange installations with this electrical power plant right
there.
This henge stood in a kind of a basin - a pool - it looks like, that would
have contained some sort of liquid. Around the perimeter of this pool
there are... And you can see this on the History Channel documentary
with Nick Cook. Igor takes Nick down into this structure and you can see
these entry ports for all of this heavy duty electrical cabling, okay?
Apparently, when tested at night, these concentration camp inmates
described this barrel-like thing that would glow a pale blue glow and it
would rise above the tree line and kind of sit there and then it would
fall back down; lower back down.
So those are our data points. I dont think that the dimensions of the
device, at this point in my research, are functionally significant so
lets turn to the cryogenic cooling, okay? Were dealing already we know
with a device that is using these two counter rotating cylinders, and I
suspect that their centrifuge isotope technology had something to do
with this, because theyre using ultra high mechanical rotation.
In other words, this is a precision machine, and its being
cryogenically cooled. And the first thing that I think of is
super-conductivity, you know. Again, high spin system, little
resistance. Its a kind of a self contained little bubble of its own...
BR: Was superconductivity understood in the physics of that time?
JF: Oh yeah. Sure. Then the next thing is we have this mysterious
substance which theyre putting into these cylinders and spinning at
high speed. I think that the presence of this power plant and the sound
of the Bell, as a beehive, indicates that this whole thing was
electrically pulsed with extremely high voltage direct current
electricity.
And that the drums were set up - and Igor agrees with me here; this is his
analysis that Im borrowing from - that you have a cathode and an anode
and this will arc to the centre. And as this stuff is spinning and
cohering along the same plane of rotation and being pulsed, electrically
pulsed, its going to drive it inward, create little plasmoids, and
youre going to get even more spin out of this thing.
So, in other words, the way Im rationalizing the device, ultimately, is
they are attempting to maximize by every possible means this extreme
torsion shear effect. This is exactly what they are going after. They
are trying to figure out if they can manipulate and engineer the fabric
of space-time.
BR: With what end?
JF: To what end, again, I think theres these three purposes in mind:
the Bell is part of a... The departmental oversight, lets say, of the
Bell is three things.
First, you have some attachment to the Forschung Inviclum Inpatento,
which is a super secret SS entity that is pulling every patent
application within the Third Reich, and later occupied Europe, that has
national security implications.
Number two, its under an entity called SS Entwicklungstelle vier which
means Development Area Four. The mission brief of that department is to
make Germany energy independent and its that department that you have
investigating things like controlled fusion, zero point energy, and so
on and so forth. So its attached to that department.
Then the final department that its attached to is General Hans Kammler
and his think tank down in the Pils in Czechoslovakia in the Scotia
Munitions Works. And the mission brief of that department of the SS is
to brainstorm its way from first generation to second and third and
fourth generations - and heres the key - to work out the necessary steps in
the technology tree, to get from one to the other, and then to do it.
Okay?
BR: Mm-hm.
JF: So the Bell is connected with all these departments and what this
suggests to me, given the physics involved here, is that theyre trying
to create a prototype technology. And I want to emphasize this: This
thing is not a UFO, it is not itself a weapon and it is not itself a
zero point energy device.
Its a prototype technology, or a gateway technology, that
they are using in developing to investigate each of those three areas.
That I think is what you have with this project. But I think the results
were significant enough to them, by 1944, that they give it this extreme
classification - kriegsentscheidend - war decisive.
So theyre already seeing the military potential of this thing. This is
a field propulsion potential here of just extraordinary capability. And
this is a weapon potential here of just extraordinary capability, but
its a kind of a unified technology.
BR: Now...
KC: It also sounds like its a
time machine. I mean, it sounds like its
creating what Jodie Foster entered, in a sense, in Contact.
JF: Right. I use the term time dilation here, and I dont want
relativistic associations, but I dont want people to think that this is
a device that can be used as a practical device for time travel - going
backward or forward into the future. But the field effects here on
plants, I think, are key.
And another thing I should mention is: I think one of the purposes of
this 'Xerum' and the use of probably some isotope of mercury and nuclear
isomers was precisely the fact that, if they were able to achieve a
severe time dilation effect, the way youre going to try and measure it
is precisely by changes in radioactive decay, okay?
BR: [inaudible]
JF: Yes. So I think this is yet another reason theyre spinning this
stuff up and pulsing it. Its kind of at one and the same time the fuel
of the device and the measurement of what theyre getting out of it.
KC: But is it possible, two things
JF: Mm hm.
KC:
one, that if in spinning which its creating a portal, in essence,
its creating a torsion field around
JF: Yes. Its creating this twisted can effect.
KC: But youre saying it affected plants on the outside of it.
JF: Yes.
KC: Is there any chance that on the inside you wouldnt have the same
effect?
JF: Good question. To my knowledge - and I think
Igor Witkowski would
probably back me up here. To my knowledge there is no evidence that this
device was constructed in such a way that you could put people into it,
or plants or animals or what have you into this device. Now, that
doesnt mean that...
Lets put ourselves in the Nazi shoes for a moment and kind of
speculate. If by, say 1942/43 when it is very clear from the documents
that Igor has gathered, they have been successful enough with this
project even to split it into the physics component and the medical
component, okay? Which indicates - Igor thinks (and I think that hes
quite right here) - that the Nazis have decided: Okay. Were far enough
along we need to learn how to limit the effects of this stuff on living
beings.
If this is the case, then theres nothing to prevent the Nazis from
building or modifying that machine, building another one, so that they
can do precisely that. And that would be a logical step for them to
take. But, as of yet, we dont have any hard evidence that they did
this. Thats all Im saying. So, yes. It has a field around it where the
effects are quite deadly.
BR: Now, as a leap
JF: Sure.
BR:
and one that some of our viewers may already have been making.
JF: Uh-huh.
BR: If, to mirror what you said at the start of our conversation when
you said: Well, lets assume that the Germans have been successful in
establishing some degree of nuclear weapon technology.
JF: Right.
BR: Lets suppose that the Americans had done something in
the Montauk
project.
JF: Okay.
BR: As its popularly been...
JF: Portrayed.
BR: ...portrayed as some kind of a
Star Gate device that involves huge
amounts of electrical power, a lot of trial and error experimentation...
JF: Uh-huh.
BR: ...and even the idea, you know - heaven forbid - that children picked up
off the streets were used as a means of trying to push them into this
thing to see if they would survive the journey.
JF: Right.
BR: Is this a ridiculous leap in your mind or is this something that
youre willing to entertain, theoretically, that theres the connection
here. As this technology
.
JF: Between the Bell and Montauk?
BR: Well, yes. I mean... Because, as this conversation continues, I want
your take on what happened to this technology after the war. The
significance of Kammler...
JF: Right.
BR: ...and what happened to him. [Farrell laughs] What happened to this
technology and the deals that may have been made?
JF: Right.
BR:
and whoever, and where it is now. What happened to it?
JF: Okay.
BR: This is not the kind of thing thats just abandoned, is it a failed
project?
JF: No-no. [laughs]
BR: Certainly not. There are too many smart people...
JF: Oh, yes!
BR: ...who are too interested in keeping on playing with this incredible
toy.
JF: Okay, well let me dispense with Montauk. That is not a project that
I have investigated deeply, Okay? Ive investigated enough to know that
theres a lot of (if I can use the expression) wacky stuff out there and
I just dont want to go there. Theres been really only one good book
about it, in my estimation, and I cant even recall the title of it.
From some of the descriptions of the project: Yeah, it appears that
theyre kind of investigating similar things, but not really. So I dont
make a connection between the Bell and Montauk at all in my mind
intuitively. It just has too many... its got too many elements like
the Vril society channeling all this information and thats where we are
getting this science. Its got too much of that for me.
But as for where does the Bell go. The way I kind of outline in my books
it appears to me that Martin Bormann is the key figure here. And in each
and every case that we see these German scientists surrendering to the
Allies, lets give the example of the rocket scientists, we in the
United States get sort of the cr√®me de la cr√®me, Okay? As to where the
Bell goes. In my opinion Martin Bormann sees to it that the Allies and
the Soviet Union get more or less an equal division of the technological
spoils.
He sees to it, according to my research, that the United States gets
crucial atom bomb components. Fissile U235, infrared proximity fuses
that are a nice handy thing to have around when you are trying to
detonate plutonium cores, all of this technology he sees to it that the
United States gets. He sees to it that the Soviet Union gets a crucial
Nazi scientist that had developed certain isotope enrichment
technologies.
BR: Who was that?
JF: Baron Manfred from Arjona, who, of course, used cyclotrons and mass
spectrometers just like Lawrence did over here. So this goes to the
Soviet Union - oops! - along with the centrifuge technology. So hes seeing
to it that all of this technology is being equally divided.
But if youre going to have a post war, extra-territorial Nazi state, so
to speak, and its going to have organization, and if you are going to
have an ongoing research project, theres two things you cant have: You
cant have atom bombs because thats going to require large enrichment
plants, of course thats going to be an easy target. You cant have
large rocket gantries you are going to need a project that is truly
sensational and would pay massive dividends and yet be a project that
you could much easier keep secret, okay? And thats the Bell.
BR: Okay.
JF: So in other words, what Im telling you is, the Allies and the
Soviet Union get the jets, the rockets, the infrared sights, the
computers, the semi-conductor chips, you know, all of this stuff. But
the project that was classified war decisive the Nazis keep to
themselves.
In my research I think that, definitely, a case can be made that the
post war fusion project that was taking place in Juan Perons Argentina,
is really nothing more than a continuation of certain aspects of this
Bell project.
In other words, with all of those Nazis located in
Argentina, including - as I make a case in my books - Martin Bormann
himself. You have the boss, in other words, right there in the area
where this secret Argentine project is being conducted.
So, in other words, Peron is not really the one that is in control of
this. Its Bormann. Hes the financier, okay? So you have the Bell not
going to the West, not going to the Soviet Union, you have it going to
Argentina. Now, you mentioned Kammler...
KC: Im sorry, but I have to ask...
JF: Sure.
KC: Dont you think theres a very good chance that what was going on in
Argentina was under the purview of the United States? Because a lot of
the head Nazis did go to the United States, wouldnt you say?
JF: Well, there are Nazis that go here but the important ones, no. And
the reason I say that is that... If you go back to my book
SS Brotherhood of the Bell, I pick up on something that Igor Witkovsky very
explicitly mentions in his book, and that is that it appears that the
United States was desperately trying to reconstruct the personnel team
of the Bell. In other words, we didnt get the people, and if were
trying to reconstruct the personnel team, that means we didnt get the
documents from the project and probably we didnt get the device.
If we had the device we probably wouldnt have needed much of the
personnel. So we really didnt get much of anything. Ive only been able
to identify two Bell scientists that made it to this country. One was,
incidentally, Dr. Hubertus Strughold who was involved in the medical
aspect of the project. The other one was a fellow by the name of Dr.
Kurt Debus.
Now this guy is an interesting character because he apparently was one
of these top scientists because he was the man that designed the power
plant for the Bell. Now heres why hes significant. I have a picture of
him in SS Brotherhood of the Bell and hes standing right next to Dr. Wernher Von Braun [laughs] at NASA and youre nodding your head and
smiling, you know where this is going!
Hes standing right next to Wernher Von Braun at NASA, and they are kind
of pointing off to something in the distance like that, and hes a
senior flight director for the Apollo program at Cape Canaveral. So in
other words, as an administrator, hes got his hands in all the NASA
pies. But the man isnt even a rocket scientist. Hes an electrical
engineer.
BR: Its really weird, isnt it?
JF: Well, its so weird [laughs] to go there where you want me to go.
Its so weird that I happen to think that this indicates that theres an
alternative technology in play here.
BR: Okay.
JF: In the Apollo program.
BR: Yup! Let me inject a little anecdote that may make you smile. This
is a personal anecdote, and I dont even think Kerrys heard this one.
My father was a facial recognition expert who worked with the British
home office.
JF: Okay.
BR: He... Among many things, he invented Photofit, the facial
recognition system used to catch crooks.
JF: Okay.
BR: And Identi-kit, which preceded it, was an idea that was stolen from
him.
JF: Right.
BR: And every now and then the British home office would consult him
with a special request. And I remember sitting around the kitchen table,
in the 1970s when I was in my mid-twenties, and my father looking at
pictures of Martin Bormann
JF: [laughs] Oh boy.
BR:
and he had been approached by the British home office who had some
pictures of an old man that had been sent to them either from Brazil or
Argentina, and I cannot remember which, (and my father is now no longer
with us) and my father was being tasked to state whether or not this
man, that had been found in the 1970s, was Martin Bormann and my father
said: Yes it absolutely was. So, how about that for a little anecdote?
JF: Yeah, well. [laughs] Ive got an anecdote of my own. Its not my
personal anecdote but I mention in my
Nazi International
book that the
CBS journalist Paul Manning, that was a close associate of Ed Murrow,
you know, the very famous journalist that was in the UK during the blitz
and later on TV.
Well, Manning wrote a book. This was after Ladislas Farago had come out
with his book about Martin Bormann, the Fourth Reich and all that stuff.
Well Manning, I think, in a certain sense, was kind of miffed at the way
they had treated a fellow journalist, and he wrote a book called Martin
Bormann: Nazi in Exile. And he basically verified that the documents
that Farago had used in his book were real. They were legit, okay?
Well he found something else. [laughs] He found that Martin Bormann - I
think around 1967 - had cashed a check [laughs] at Manufacturers Hanover
and Chase Manhattan Bank. It was cleared through Deutsche Bank in Buenos
Aires in Argentina, and the check had been cashed over his own
signature. [laughs]
BR: Incredible. [Farrell laughs] Amazing.
KC: I dont understand. I mean, you can back off the link between this
- I
dont know how to say his name - the guy in Florida
JF: Debus. Kurt Debus.
KC:
Debus. Okay, and Bormann. In other words youre, in essence, saying
they no longer spoke?
JF: Oh no, no, no! Im not backing off that link at all. Quite the
contrary. No. Im very much in agreement with Richard Hoagland and
Mike
Bara that, you know, in
Dark Mission they outlined the case that, by the
time of these late Apollo missions, its the Nazis that are the most
significant influence inside of NASA.
No, quite the contrary. In fact, one of the things I try and mention in
SS Brotherhood of The Bell, is that our early monitoring of these German
scientists, that were over here as part of our missile program and then
the early space program, discovered that there seemed to be a sort of
chain of command between all of these Nazis still in existence, and that
they even had mail drops.
And they were driving these fancy cars and getting money from
they-knew-not-where. That it wasnt coming from a NASA scientist salary.
They were driving around [laughs] in these Mercedes cars but nothing was
ever done about it. Thats, to me, whats suspicious because yeah, that
clearly indicates theyve got some connection to this post war Nazi
organization. Very clearly and very palpably.
KC: So what about Wernher Von Braun
JF: Uh-huh.
KC:
what about him, and the link with
JF:
with all of this?
KC: Yeah. With Debus. Because, if they are working together, is there
more than just a working relationship? In other words, what Im trying
to find out is, where did he fit in to this echelon
JF:
to this picture? Alright! Good question. I do not, in my books,
speculate on what that relationship may be. But I'll do so here because
I think it's an excellent question.
If you look at Mr. Hoagland and Mr. Baras hypothesis in Dark Mission,
what you have ultimately is a two-track space program. Youve got one
thats out there for public consumption with the rockets and, you know,
all the fireworks and flag-waving, Mom and apple pie. And then there is
something else. Its like youre dealing with a black hole of news.
Theres news stories around it and then theres this big black hole
right in the middle thats conspicuous for its blackness, okay?
Well, this little picture of von Braun and Debus, to me, is sort of the
icon of what youre seeing with this two-track space program, because
very clearly these two men are engaged in a private conversation thats
behind glass; theyre both wearing their earphones. Theyre both kind of
close to each other and theyre pointing off in the distance to
something, okay? So I think this relationship goes back to Nazi Germany
because I do know that Debus was also part of von Brauns team at
Peenem√ºnde. And what he was doing for von Braun there was, he was
constructing the measuring equipment for these stationary rocket test
gantries that the Nazis had built there. But hes also got this
connection to the Bell.
Now this is why I find this question interesting, because if you go into
the Cooper-Cantwell documents (MAJIC 12 documents)
- and Im not arguing
for or against their authenticity; Im saying Im looking only at the
internal evidence of the documents themselves - they kind of corroborate
this picture because what they suggest is that these Nazi Paperclip
rocket scientists were brought in to look at this Roswell wreckage.
And
the first question that occurs to my mind: Well, why bring in Nazi
scientists if you suspect this is ET? Youre going to want to keep that as
classified as possible from your former enemy, okay? But you bring em
in because it looks German.
And von Braun... Okay? Youve got von Braun and Arthur Rudolph and all
these Nazi scientists looking at this stuff and they come up with this
explanation of what this is. Its some sort of Neutronic engine with
fusion thats taking place, and so on and so forth. And that tells me
that if thats true, then somebody - if its disinformation - somebody knows
that Debus and von Braun communicated something way back in Nazi Germany
and that von Braun knew enough about this other secret project to be
able to say that to his American interrogators.
Hence, we go back to that picture. What that picture represents to me is
that this two-track space program begins in World War Two and in Nazi
Germany. Because what do you have? Youve got rockets that are very
visible. And youve got this Bell thing and all of this secret stuff
that really doesnt even come out until after German Reunification. The
Nazis are seeing to it that the Soviet Union and the United States get
the jets and the rockets, but theyre keeping this to themselves.
BR: If theyre keeping it to themselves, what have they been doing with
it in the last 63 years?
JF: Excellent question. Because if you can imagine... Lets just go
back. Youve got Martin Bormann sitting in Argentina, with a joint bank
account with Juan Peron, thats sitting on top of almost eight hundred
million dollars. Thats a hefty chunk of change at that point in
history. Properly invested... and Bormann was a financial whiz. I mean
theres no doubt about this. He knew how to move money and make money.
Properly invested, you can sustain this kind of independent project,
move it around. At some point I think its going to require a partner if
its going to be made big and practical and usable. Okay?
But yeah, in 63 years its very feasible to me that theyve worked out
the medical bugs, you know, that you can put somebody inside of one of
these contraptions and fly it around, okay? Yeah, its very conceivable
that this would be possible.
Its conceivable to me that at an even earlier date you could take
aspects of that technology and wed it to more conventional technologies
to kind of boost their efficiency, so to speak. This is why I think that
picture of Debus and von Braun at NASA is very telling, because if Debus
is involved in Apollo and in The Bell... Again, that to me points to an
alternative technology, possibly. That and other things. Im certainly
not arguing the whole case on that.
So yeah, in 63 years what could they do with this? You know, project the
learning curve. You know, to me its very feasible the medical issues
have been solved. They may have been able to find a practical
application for free energy. But you know, heres the bad news: Once
again, they may have been able to weaponize this stuff. And that, to me,
is the scariest part.
BR: But if I understand you right, youre suggesting theres an isolated
group of Nazis; maybe their descendents...
JF: Right.
BR: ...somewhere in South America, probably Argentina...
JF: Brazil, Chile... [laughs] Yeah.
BR: Etcetera, yeah. With access to this salvaged and exported exotic
technology...
JF: Mm-hm.
BR: ...with continued funding and continued protection from somewhere.
JF: Somewhere.
BR: That are doing what? Theyre not having to pay their electricity
bills? Theyre flying around, looking around, and weaponizing it against
who? This doesnt seem to make sense on its own.
JF: Okay. Let me give you a context. The modern financial meltdown, to
me, is a sign that there is a breakdown occurring between the old
postwar d√©tente. And what do I mean by that? The founders of the
Bilderberg Group were Lawrence and
David Rockefeller; a
Rothschild was
involved. That represented kind of the Anglo-American corporate
interest.
But on the European side, who is the principal founder?
Prince Bernhard
of the Netherlands. Whos Prince Bernhard? Hes an SS officer. And
therefore, if you still have an extant post-war Nazi chain of command,
and weve already mentioned that we do... If you have an extant post-war
Nazi chain of command, then an SS officer like Bernhard answers to his
chief, which is Martin Bormann, who holds an SS four-star generals
rank, okay?
But Bernhard is also a vice president of - oh, looky-looky -
IG
Farben, okay? Which, incidentally, I want to point out, IG Farben was
only finally completely liquidated in what year?
BR: I have no idea.
JF: 2003.
BR: Really!
JF: Yes. [laughs]
BR: Okay.
JF: This corporation was so big and so huge, and all of these licensing
agreements that it had all over the world were in such a tangle that it
took literally that long to finally get rid of the whole thing. Thats
an enormous amount of power.
KC: But did Bormann report to von Braun?
JF: No. Von Braun reported... If anyones reporting in that chain, its
von Braun reporting to Bormann. Okay?
KC: Okay.
JF: But lets get back to Prince Bernhard, because present at these
early Bilderberger meetings is a very significant figure. Its Dr.
Hermann Josef Abs, who is the CEO of Deutsche Bank, one of the worlds
largest international banks. The bank that, incidentally, cleared
Bormanns check in Buenos Aires that was drawn on Manufacturers Hanover
and Chase Manhattan; big Rockefeller banks. Morgan Rockefeller
interests.
So putting all of these little pieces together, what it looks like to me
is that the Bilderberger groups first secret purpose after the war was
to take all of this liquid cash that is sitting in the hands of these
post-war Nazis and move it through these Western banks, make it
available to these Western bankers. And a lot of it, I suspect, was even
kept off the books. Theyre laundering a huge amount of money, in other
words.
Now, heres the problem. I like to say - and I thank Richard Hoagland for
this kind of analogy because he came out with this one at a conference
and I just love it: With Martin Bormann were dealing with a Dick Cheney
without the warmth and charm.
So in other words, when theyre negotiating these deals, you know: We
agree with you. Corporate fascism is the way to go and were agreed that
world domination is kind of a cool idea and were willing to play ball
with each other. And heres a lot of money to do it. [laughs] You know?
Well, when youre dealing with someone like Bormann, youre dealing as I
said, with Dick Cheney with no warmth and charm. That money is going to
come with a lot of strings attached, and when the markers come due youd
better be able to pay.
BR: Mm-hm.
JF: Uh-huh.
BR: Mm-hm.
JF: And if... with Bormann you have an intelligence organization that
was headed up by his friend Heinrich Muller, whom I also believe escaped
Nazi Germany - the actual head of the Gestapo - youre dealing with people
that cannot only make threats, but carry them out, even against the
extremely wealthy and the extremely powerful.
KC: But the US won the war.
JF: Sort of.
KC: Why would the US let the Nazis go to Argentina, with their blessing,
without having their hands in that pie?
JF: Simple. Exactly. Theyre got their hands in that pie.
KC: Okay.
JF: And Bormann, as Ive said, has negotiated - again, this is a part
of... I know youre under time constraints, so for me to answer that
question Id have to keep you here, okay, but...
KC: We [overtalk] a little time here [laughs].
JF: Well, basically what we have with Bormann is working out a deal to
surrender all these atom bomb components to the United States. So in
other words, Bormann already has a certain amount of moral leverage over
the United States. He could easily expose the whole thing and expose the
United States as having made a deal with the devil. Its kind of a
classical Mexican standoff.
Thats part of the problem that were faced with. And again, part of
this deal includes all of this German military intelligence that gets
kind of slid into the CIA, you know, but remains operationally under the
control of the very same Nazi general that it was in control of during
the World War itself.
KC: [overtalk]
BR: And theres a whole bunch of
mind control technology. We havent
even gone there.
JF: Oh yes! Exactly! I mean, on and on this goes, you know. And for me
the real point is, is once we make that deal with the devil, we say:
Okay, Martin (or whoever), we need you to take care of some business and
we dont want to sully our lily-white American hands with it. But we
know that you have the people who can do this.
Sure. But in doing this deal, any time that happens, you have just put
yourself in the position to be blackmailed and these people will do it.
In other words, they can expose you as being involved in these, you
know, sordid affairs around the world. So I think the whole result of
this deal with the devil... and I think we begin to realize it right
around the 1950s with
Eisenhower, because whats he warn against when he
leaves office? Military-industrial complex. And he knows all of these
Nazis, okay? He knows these Nazis because he fought them.
And I think the warning hes giving the American people, and for that
matter The West, as a matter of fact, is not so much against the
homegrown American military-industrial complex, but whos infiltrating
and weeding their way into all of these positions of power and influence
within it - namely, Nazis. This is a very... [searching for words] ... Im
sorry to be so inarticulate here because Im trying to connect a lot of
dots very quickly for you.
But yeah, I think the ultimate reason is: theyve got a gun to the Anglo-American elites head.
And to bring it up to modern times, what... and again, Im simply
speculating here in answer to your earlier question, but the behavior of
the corporate elite at the bailout hearings, with this business of no
oversight, and the kind of pronouncements coming out of major banking
leaders and families and groups and so on, strike me as not being
acted-out panic but genuine panic. And as I go around the world I see
panic, but its not near the hysteria and pitch that it is in this
country, coming from Europe. Theres certainly panic in Iceland, but it
seems like the further east we go, the less panic and hysteria there is.
But its this bailout without oversight idea that looks to me... Thats
the kind of behavior of someone whos being blackmailed with a gun to
their head: Well, we want a lot of money but we cant tell you what its
for.
BR: This is a very, very interesting thesis.
JF: Yeah. Its very suspicious. Now to put it in the context with Nazis,
and I think the reason, perhaps, for your question is that the only
thing I see within the context of recent history in the last 60 to 70
years that could put that extremely powerful Anglo-American corporate
banking interest or elite in that kind of peril, is precisely an entity
that had enormous amounts of liquid capital that it moved into their
banks and left there for a very long time as part of the deal: Well
give you this money. Do with it what you will. Leave us alone.
BR: Is this the
research angle that you would like to follow in the
coming months
as more information becomes available about the current
crisis?
JF: Im not really a conspiracy theorist. I touch on these things only
when it seems like the physics aspects of it lead there. But I get asked
this question a lot, so Ive kind of speculated, you know, reasoned out
this kind of scenario.
But I can tell you this: Im researching a book - writing a book now - that
deals with, I hope effectively, deeply-seated and rooted reasons for
this very strange connection between physics and finance that seems to
pop up over and over and over again. And Ill only say this: Its very
deeply rooted and very, very old.
BR: Yes. Thats a beautiful thought to leave a lot of people to ponder.
JF: [laughs] Leave them hanging.
BR: Something that Peter Levenda mentioned beautifully succinctly when
we talked to him last week. He said: Look, the whole world cant go
broke. Someones got to have the money.
JF: Exactly.
BR: And something that seems very obvious to us when were knocking this
subject around between us, is that if you look at all the black
projects, all the modern-day equivalents of the Bell experiments,
wherever they are...
JF: Wherever they are.
BR: ...on this planet or even elsewhere, then, you know, this is costing
money. And if you think of money as energy, its like where... You know,
this energy is being drained out of the global circuit, and its going
somewhere.
JF: Where is it going? [laughs]
BR: Yes. Where is it going? Which is another way of reframing the same
question that I believe youre asking.
JF: Exactly! Exactly.
BR: Now, just to draw together some of these strings, and there are a
lot of strings.
JF: Oh yes. [laughs]
BR: And I know that you dont even pretend that this is tidy.
JF: Oh no. I certainly dont. [laughs]
BR: And its a little bit like the sort of, you know, out-takes after a
movie: What happened to this character? What happened to that character?
Are you assuming that Hans Kammler ended up wherever Martin Bormann
ended up?
JF: Yes.
BR: Okay. Are you assuming that the reason why the Nazis never actually
used their arguably well-developed nuclear technology... And this is
another whole interview to talk about the evidence of that.
JF: Sure. Oh yeah. [laughs]
BR: But we support you in your thesis that it looks like it was far more
advanced than anyone has publicly given them credit for.
JF: Right. Right.
BR: But they never used it, even though they tested it and they had it
for quite a few years. Was this because they were planning to use it as
a bargaining chip later?
JF: Possibly. But I think you could possibly also make a case... Look,
one of the things... Im kind of a military strategy games buff. I play
these things all the time. Its my entertainment, you know. I do this
like people watch TV or movies, okay? And you know as well as I do that
the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front achieved this just staggering kill
ratio against the Red Army, against the Russians.
BR: Yeah. Millions of Red soldiers.
JF: Half of the casualties of World War Two were inflicted by the Nazi
war machine on Soviet Russia.
BR: Yeah. And you know I had never understood how such a tiny nation
could go up against all the Russian soldiers...
JF: And just clobber... [laughing]
BR: ...and just knock em all out. I could just never understand that.
JF: Exactly. And you know, from my amateur military historian
standpoint, conventional wisdom or operations here fail to account for
all of this. And incidentally, Russia recently - I think in the last few
years - disclosed the fact that its actual casualties may have been as
much as ten to fifteen million more than that 25 million weve been
told.
BR: Hm.
JF: So, you know, this tiny, bothersome little country is not only
fighting the United Kingdom, and later on the United States, and
virtually everybody else, but all of that to them is just kind of a
sideshow. This enormous military campaign is taking place on the Eastern
Front and, to my mind, as competent and tactically brilliant as the
German Army was, this doesnt explain it all to me. So theres something
else going on here, and...
KC: Do you have a theory?
JF: Yeah. Oh yeah. I write about it in my first Nazi book,
Reich of the
Black Sun. There are persistent rumors that come out of Russia,
beginning in the war, that the Nazis are using something on the Eastern
Front that they are not using against the Western allies simply because,
of course, the Communists - the Bolsheviks - are their ideological enemies,
you know. So, yeah. Theyre subhuman. We can use all of this grisly
technology we have on them. But...
KC: Are you suggesting bio-warfare?
JF: No. Im suggesting perhaps radiological bombs. I am absolutely
certain that theyre using some prototypical or first-generation
fuel-air bombs. And if you dont know what a fuel-air bomb is, thats a
conventional bomb with the explosive punch of a tactical nuke. Now, Ill
show... and Ill go further. Ill tell you how theyre using them.
Theyre using them in rocket-launched multi-barrel artillery batteries.
So if you can say the phrase tactical nuke and carpet bombing, you get
an idea of, you know, this carnage that theyre inflicting on the Red
Army. And its so bad that in 1941 during the battle for Moscow when the
Germans are doing this stuff, the Soviets, through Sweden, tell the
Germans that if they dont cease and desist theyll start using poison
gas. You know, its that bad.
BR: But there are also... I mean, besides that fascinating induction
from those circumstances...
JF: Right.
BR: ...there are eyewitness reports...
JF: Oh yes. Absolutely.
BR: ...of people who report something that looks exactly like a nuclear
blast.
JF: Yes. Exactly. Exactly. Youve got all of this stuff going on on the
Eastern Front that is inexplicable without, in my opinion, the use and
deployment of all of these advanced Nazi weapons. So thats, I think,
why we dont hear of it. And a final point in that respect is, during
the war Stalins government is going to be loathe to admit that it is
facing an enemy that is that much more technologically superior.
BR: Its embarrassing at least. [laughs]
JF: At the very least its embarrassing. But imagine in the Red Army
when the morale, with this slaughter, this blood-letting thats going
on, that you have to have Commissars literally threatening to shoot
anyone who deserts, just to maintain morale at some of these big
battles. If Stalin had admitted this publicly, it, number one, I think
could have so severely weakened his government that it might have cost
him his government, you know.
BR: Yes.
JF: And number two, had that been the case, it may have brought in a
government that would have been willing to sue for peace. In fact,
Stalin even tried to do that in 1942.
BR: Yes. And those reports of those generals; first commanders, being
willing to shoot the soldiers who would desert... This is completely
contrary to everything we understand about the Russian psyche, the
Russian personality, the Russian dogged resistance.
JF: Exactly.
BR: It just doesnt match, does it?
JF: It doesnt. Exactly.
KC: I thought it was the Russian winter that stopped the Nazis.
JF: Well, I mean, we get... Yeah. Theres all of this happy claptrap
[Kerry laughs], especially in American, you know, university and history
textbooks.
KC: Okay.
JF: You know, America comes in and saves the day in World War One.
America comes in and saves the day in World War Two, you know. To me,
this is just military baloney.
KC: Okay.
JF: Because we come in fairly late. And if you look at American
campaigns in World War Two, were kind of on the periphery of things all
the time. The actions going on in the Soviet Union.
So, you know, yeah, General Winter and all that. But you can argue
against that thesis because in August of 1941 Adolph Hitler turns Army
Group Center, the Second Panzer Army, 650 miles south out of the way to
encircle some Russian forces in Kiev, when in front of them hes 250
miles from Moscow at the end of August [laughs] and they have decimated
sixty percent of the Red Army and hes got one Russian rifle division
standing between him and Moscow. So the war was lost, not by General
Winter or General Mud, but by Hitler making this dumb, stupid, silly,
indefensible military decision to take that detour. [laughs]
BR: Yeah.
KC: Is it possible that even that is, you know, disinfo? And that what
really changed the war was the deals being made with the Americans
because they decided they were fighting a losing battle and they were
making monetary deals and getting out of Germany because they wanted to
rewrite history and go in a different direction?
JF: Okay. Well, I think the deals begin to be struck - the feelers are put
out for them, certainly - in the period from the fall of the Sixth Army at
Stalingrad up to the failure of the German offensive at Kursk in 1943;
July of 1943. So its this time period
KC: Thats early.
JF: Thats fairly early. After Kursk, the offensive capability of the
Wehrmacht is broken for a good year and a half, okay? So its during
this period that the Nazi leadership quietly make the feelers, hope that
the offensive goes well, but they put out, they lay the foundation.
After the battle of Kursk, this kicks into high gear and you have all of
these secret negotiations taking place. Yeah. I think you can make a
certain argument that some of this history has been deliberately
doctored to hide this.
BR: Its a reasonable assumption.
JF: Sure.
BR: Let me ask you one final question...
JF: Okay.
BR: ...although its an important one and it could be a big one, and I
dont know whether its an easy one or not.
JF: Okay.
BR: But that is: If there is such a thing as a central power base of the
Nazis now, where is it? Who are they? And what strings are they pulling?
And why should we care?
JF: Ah... Germany and some of the major politicians. [laughs]
BR: Germany? Now?
JF: Germany. Yeah.
BR: Really! I didnt know you were going to say that!
JF: Yeah, as surprising as it may seem. One of the things that I looked
at very carefully is the German Reunification. When the Berlin Wall
falls, it falls on the exact date - I forget the exact numerical date in
my head - but it falls on the exact date of the anniversary of Kristallnacht in 1938.
BR: Hm.
JF: It falls... and that, incidentally, is the anniversary of the
Beer
Hall Putsch. Okay?
BR: Okay.
JF: Now if you go back and recall whats taking place in East Germany at
the time. Theres all these mass meetings and demonstrations in Leipzig
and Dresden of a bunch of East German intellectuals that are pushing for
the reform of the East German state. Theyre not pushing for
reunification.
But then an amazing thing happens - and this, to me, is the dead
giveaway - the meetings themselves begin to have lots of neo-Nazis start
attending. These people show up with cell phones, computers, and lots of
money, and using typical Nazi tactics, strong-arm any opposition out of
these meetings and begin to kind of steer them so that even the popular
slogans that the reformers were chanting: Wir sind das Volk (We are the
people) is changed to Wir sind ein Volk.
BR: Ah. We are one people.
JF: Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein F¬∏hrer. Okay?
BR: Yes.
JF: Now, on the other side, Chancellor K√∂hls government in Bonn is very
quietly but very seriously channeling money and driving this stuff. So,
in other words, what Im saying: you cannot have neo-Nazi cells in
communist Eastern Europe suddenly popping up with cell phones,
computers, all this money, organized, ready to go, without having had an
intelligence structure in Eastern Europe to begin with to support it.
And when all of this activity happens - BANG - all of a sudden Bonn has,
ready to go, ready to hand, a plan for reunification. And its basically
a shotgun wedding and its typical Hitlers tactics: Well, well give
you the opportunity to vote on whether you want reunification.
And
again, what happens? When the referendum is held in those East Germany
provinces, the neo-Nazis show up and they are driving some of this
activity to keep people voting that are going to vote for it and to keep
people that dont want that out.
BR: But isnt this part of establishing one of the central planks for
the European Union?
JF: Oh, of course it is!
BR: Okay.
JF: But what does Martin Bormann say that he wants to do after the war?
He wants to create a European federation, or confederation, which
Germany will be able to dominate. And listen to his words now: By
elastic political means. In other words, hes learned to speak the lingo
to a T.
BR: Okay. But are you saying, then, that whatever may or may not be
going on in America right now is divorced from what youve just
described? Theres no connection?
JF: Oh no, no. Not at all. Ive very alarmed because what I see
happening in America within the last ten, twelve years, is this
emergence of a horrendous fascist police-state/snitch culture. Oh
absolutely.
No, I wouldnt say its divorced from it at all.
But I am saying look to Europe and look at recent events very carefully,
and look especially at the events surrounding German Reunification and
the moves Germany made afterward - almost immediately - to crack up
Czechoslovakia and to crack up Yugoslavia. Because, remember, it was
West Germany, the recently-reunited Germany, that was the first nation
to recognize breakaway Croatia over the opposition of Washington and
London. They did that unilaterally.
And when Croatia got its independence, it turned around and said: Oh,
please help us. Will someone please help us? Send peace
keepers? - BANG - Germany sent troops. BANG - Germany sent the Luftwaffe.
BANG - Germany sold off all that communist equipment to Croatia and
re-equipped the East German part of the newly-absorbed East German Army
with Bundeswehr equipment.
So look at Germany carefully. And it did a lot more. I mean, go onto
YouTube. This is a kick, because I found on YouTube a Bundeswehr
Wachbataillon doing a music drill show in Cologne - okay? - in 2005!
[laughs]
This just floored me because here in America, you know, [laughing] we
have no idea that this is going on. But they come marching into this
stadium, carrying the Bell Tree, drums a-blazing, piping out Prussias
glory. You know? So in other words, Im looking at a restoration of all
of these old Prussian military traditions right before my eyes, and the
only thing theyre not doing is the goose step. [laughs] Im just
floored.
But it scares me because I told some friends about five years before the
reunification even happened, I said: You watch. If it does happen, they
will slowly bring back all of those military traditions.
And now, you
know, this two, three years later, theyre holding Torchlight Tattoos
with the Bundeswehr again marching in, carrying the Bell Tree, and all
these old Prussian trappings, doing this Torchlight Military Tattoo out
in front of the Reichstag, you know. So, its scary to me. I mean, its
creepy.
KC: And also...
BR: Understood.
KC: Obama was... did a special...
JF: At the Siegess√§ule!
KC: At the Gate, right? - [ed. note:
Brandenburg Gate] - Which is supposed
to be a very important symbol of the event from the occult standpoint.
JF: Oh sure! Of course. Yeah. And I dont think this is a good symbolism
at all. There are some people that do, you know. Im disagreed with my
good friend Richard Hoagland over this. But, you know, why do we have a
presidential candidate go to Berlin? Sure, its nice to have good
relations with Europe, obviously.
BR: Its also got to do with the touch of the Kennedy.
JF: Yeah. Its good to have good relations with Moscow and Beijing,
[laughs] you know, and that would seem to me to be the logical place
that you would go. But Berlin?
KC: But theres some subliminal thing going on here.
JF: Oh sure.
KC: I mean, if theyre permeated NASA, they have to permeate the
undercover, you know,
black projects...
JF: Right.
KC: ...thoroughly, and that means theyve permeated the real secret
government of the United States. So theres an alignment there.
JF: Okay. Ask yourself this:
The Hadron Collider, okay? Youve got two
huge counter-rotating rings and theyre going to spin up these particles
and smash em together. Okay? I find that whole counter-rotating idea
really weird, you know, suggestively weird. But the really weird thing
to me is:
Why is the first Christian Democratic Union Party Chancellor
of Germany after K√∂hl a physicist? [Ed. note: he is referring to
Angela
Merkel.]
BR: Hm.
JF: Did you know that?
BR: I did not.
JF: Shes a Ph.D. in physics. [laughs]
BR: Okay.
JF: Why is she a Ph.D. in physics?
BR: A Ph.D. in physics.
JF: Yeah. Now, you know what a German Ph.D. is like, to get.
BR: I do.
JF: [laughs] You know, they dont hand them out by any means and this,
to me... Why is someone like that even in politics, but especially at
that level? You know? This is not a Ph.D. in physics becoming premier of
Somalia, you know. [laughs] This is a rather sophisticated nation,
technologically. So that to me, you know... its another little
indicator that we have to watch things over there very carefully.
BR: So now, whats really fascinating here... As youve kindly pointed
out, we are under a pressure of time this evening. Weve only done
nearly two hours and we could probably do another four without even
thinking about it because there are so many places this conversation can
go.
JF: Oh yeah.
BR: I dont know when we will next all be in the same place at the same
time, but right now I would like to say that wed love to talk to you
again on audio to explore some of these things.
JF: Sure. Thatd be fine.
BR: And Im quite sure Im going to wake up tomorrow morning, if not go
down right now in the escalator, with a whole bunch of questions which I
havent had a chance to ask.
JF: Right. Right.
BR: What I do want to do is I want to thank you for your diligence, your
creativity, your articulateness in explaining these concepts which are
difficult for a lot of people to grasp because this story is so huge.
JF: Oh yes.
BR: Youve been describing that part of the iceberg that is not often
seen.
JF: Right. Right.
BR: Someones got to do it, and I think youve done a wonderful job.
JF: Well, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that.
BR: Its our pleasure and our privilege to assist you in that, and we
look forward to seeing you again, and we look forward to talking to you
again.
JF: Itll be my pleasure.
BR: Thank you very much for your time.
JF: Thank you.
