"For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that
were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn't.
Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully
manufactured for him in advanced by the
Council on Foreign Relations One
World Money group... Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of
artillery, he exploded that prepared "ammunition" in the middle of an
unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his
internationalist political support.
The UN is but a long range, international banking apparatus nearly set up
for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One World
Revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power.
The depression was the calculated 'shearing' of the public by the World
Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call
money in the New York money market... The
One World Government leaders and
their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and
credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned
Federal
Reserve Bank."
