Agenda 21 is the enemy of humanity and this
article is a snap shot of how the Agenda 21 forces are attacking people on
an individual, a state and a regional basis.
Agenda 21 Attacks Its Detractors
by Separating Families
Anti-Agenda 21 activist,
Stacy Lynne, defeated several
Agenda 21 proposals in Fort Collins, Colorado, which would have cost the
local community hundreds of jobs.
And what was her reward? Did she get a
commendation from the city council? Did she get a meritorious service award
from the Mayor?
What she received was one of the most heinous
political retaliations in recent history. Her son, Jaden, was stolen by the
Agenda 21 controlled courts in Larimer County, Colorado. Her son was taken
without so much as allegation of wrong doing on the part of Stacy.
Despite never having had her parental rights
severed, she has not been allowed to see her son in 16 months.
Agenda 21 Attacks "Off the Grid"
Americans
Kim Fahey,
located in Antelope Valley, CA., constructed one of the most unique homes in
the United States.
He received notoriety for the design of his home
which became affectionately known as Phonehenge. Fahey was also living off
the grid, a huge violation of Agenda 21 protocols.
The Agenda 21 beholding LA County Sheriff Swat
team subsequently descended upon Fahey and arrested him for code violations.
He was sentenced to 543 days in jail because he could not afford to haul
away the debris of his home which was demolished by the County.
However, the real target, was his 'off the grid
lifestyle.'
Agenda 21 Attacks Small Farmers
I would like to say that all of these events are
somewhat operating in isolation.
However, they are becoming all too commonplace.
Consider the case of Martha Boneta. Martha is a farmer who has fought the
Agenda 21 corrupt forces of Fauquier County, Virginia.
Fauquier County is fining Martha for the
following offenses:
-
Selling farm produce and advertising her
pumpkin shavings.
-
Hosting a birthday party for a grand
total of eight 10-year-old girls.
The reality is that Martha isnt breaking any
laws.
On the other hand, Fauquier County is breaking
its own zoning ordinances, the Virginia Right to Farm Act, and the Virginia
and United States Constitution. Martha Bonetas actions are perfectly legal.
However, the Agenda 21 forces do not care about what is legal as they live
under the creed that might makes right.
Fauquier County government is fining her with
$5,500 per-day fines for hosting the birthday party without a permit.
She is also being fined for advertising her pumpkin carvings, despite the
fact that
she has a
business license. Are you kidding me? One has to now get a permit to
host a birthday party?
Below a a recent video with Martha Boneta telling her story on Fox and Friends:
In this video, Martha makes the claim that she
now owes $2 million dollars to the County in fines. Since that time, she was
also audited by the IRS in her role as a Tea Party member. Subsequently, the
County authorities tried to have her mortgage revoked.
This is classic Agenda 21 retaliation
perpetrated against those that dare to speak out.
Because of the notoriety and attention brought
to this case, the Virginia State Legislature is considering a bill that will
hold local governments in check by making local governments accountable and
will hold government officials personally liable when they intentionally
violate the rights of landowners.
Agenda 21 Forces Steal A Million
Acres and An Entire Town
The EPA and the Department of
Justice and Department of Interior, have
decided it would be a good idea if it seized an entire town, including
everyones property and turn it over to an Indian Nation.
The
EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)
did exactly this without telling the mayor or any other elected official.
The town in question is Riverton,
Wyoming and this transfer of ownership was accomplished
under the authority of the Clean Air Act which "allowed" the EPA to hand
over Riverton to the Wind River Indian Reservation.
This land grab amounts
to the transfer of ownership of over one million acres and impacts over
10,000 Americans.
In the case of Riverton, WY., the EPA has a
powerful ally in the form of President
Obama through the use of
Executive
Order (EO)13603. This EO combined with the heinous actions of the EPA have
now been used to steal an entire town and over a million acres from Wyoming.
If multi-state areas as well as a state can be
subjugated by Agenda 21, then none of us are safe.
Agenda 21 Attacks An Entire
Region of the Country
Agenda 21 forces have become so brazen so as to
attempt to destroy the farmers and ranchers in Northern California and
Southern Oregon. In other words,
Agenda 21 advocates are
attempting to destroy an entire area of the country!
At a public meeting in September of 2013,
the Siskiyou County board of supervisors approved a secession declaration,
designed to leave California, the Redding Record Searchlight reported.
The fervor to leave the state of California was also fueled by Modoc County
Supervisors who voted 4-0 in favor in secession. Federal government abuse of
property rights is fueling this rebellion in Northern California and
Southern Oregon.
Over the years, many rural residents have been
frustrated by federal environmental
laws restricting logging and other forestry activities.
The local residents feel that becoming a state
would finally allow them to push the Agenda 21 controlled federal government to
alter the onerous restrictions on government-owned land.
The residents of Northern California and
Southern Oregon are united in escaping the ravages of agenda 21.
Effectively, hunting and fishing have been
eliminated by the Agenda 21 enforcement agent, the EPA. Farmers and ranchers
are being denied previously adjudicated water rights in an attempt to
depopulate the rural areas of this region.
The
Agenda 21 forces will not
stop until the entire region becomes a dead zone.
Conclusion
There was a time, not so long ago, if you
mentioned Agenda 21, you were labeled a tin-foil hat
conspiracy theorist.
Only two years ago, I was at a town hall meeting
and Senator McCain was asked about Agenda 21 and he said that he did not
know what Agenda 21 was. Today, Agenda 21 is out in the open for all who
want to see.
In this article, I have traced instances of
individual persecution, harassment of farmers, the theft of an entire town
and the subjugation and destruction of an entire region of the country by
Agenda 21 forces. And despite all of the evidence, most people have never
heard of Agenda 21.
Agenda 21 is attempting to turn American society
upside down. If the average person could be made aware of the principles
underlying Agenda 21, every city council member, every mayor, every state
legislator would be too afraid to promote anything close to an Agenda 21
policy.
My friends, we have a lot of work to do.
