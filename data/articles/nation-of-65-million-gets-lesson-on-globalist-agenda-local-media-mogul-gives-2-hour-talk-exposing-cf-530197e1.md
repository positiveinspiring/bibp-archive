Media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul of ASTV, a
popular news and media outlet in Thailand, gave a
2-hour talk on Friday
night (in Thai) regarding the corporate-funded,
...amongst others and their role in
destabilizing nation states around the world and in particular their
unfolding plot in Thailand itself.

Limthongkul - media mogul turned infowarrior - goes from
rallying crowds to informing them. Malaysia has
used
this tactic to great effect against globalist meddling
in their sovereign affairs - one can only hope Thailand
is starting down a similar path.
No punches were pulled, and the talk was
accompanied by a news story on the ASTV website, Manager.co.th (in Thai),
complete with graphics illustrating the documented ties between foreign
corporate-financier interests and seditious elements within Thailand working
with them.

Sondhi's narrative encapsulates the underlying
cause of over 6 years of political instability plaguing Thailand and focuses
on Wall Street and London's proxy of choice, Thaksin Shinawatra.
Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailands prime minister from 2001 until a
military coup removed him in 2006,
was a former
Carlyle
Group adviser and was literally
reporting to the globalist Council on Foreign Relations
(CFR) in New York City on the eve of his ousting from
power.
While in office, Thaksin
attempted to ramrod
through the US-Thailand Free-Trade Agreement (FTA) without
parliamentary approval, a 2004 FTA backed by the exact same US-ASEAN
Business Council recently visited by Thaksins "red shirt" street mob
leaders in April of 2011.

US-ASEAN
Business Council, a whos-who of corporate fascism in
the US, has been approached by Thailands
pro-democracy UDD for support.
The UDD never fully
explains what corporations like Exxon, BP, Goldman
Sachs, Monsanto, or other banes to humanity have to do
with democracy or what sort of support was asked for or
promised.
The council in 2004
included,
-
3M
-
war profiteering Bechtel
-
Boeing
-
Cargill
-
Citigroup
-
General Electric
-
IBM
-
the notorious
Monsanto,
...and currently
also includes the criminal,
These corporations are more synonymous with,
-
mass-murder
-
mass-corruption
-
war
-
human suffering,
...than any of the
democratic and open society ideals Thaksin or his UDD claim to be
bringing to Thailand.
Since the 2006 coup that toppled his autocratic regime, Thaksin has been
represented by US corporate-financier elites via their lobbying firms
including,
-
Kenneth Adelman of the Edelman PR firm
(Freedom House, International Crisis Group, PNAC)
-
James Baker of Baker Botts (CFR)
-
Robert Blackwill of Barbour Griffith &
Rogers (CFR)
-
Kobre & Kim
-
currently Robert Amsterdam of Amsterdam
& Peroff (Chatham House)
Meanwhile, his red shirt UDD street mob have
received rhetorical support by
US-funded NGOs like
Prachatai.
Thaksin more recently had his own sister run in his place for elections in
July 2011, as he is a convicted criminal currently in hiding abroad, evading
a 2 year jail sentence. Thaksins proxy political party, with heavy
rhetorical support from the Western media, including threats from the
notorious Council on Foreign Relations to allow Thaksins proxy party to
take power unhindered, won the elections
with only 35% of eligible voters
behind them.
Despite gaining power, Thaksins legitimacy and
support base is now exposed in full-light of the recent election as tenuous
at best and still faces an entrenched Thai establishment and Thailands
powerful military.
All of this documented information, once exclusively in the realm of the
alternative media, has now been splashed across Thailand's mainstream via
Sondhi's Friday presentation.
ASTV's Manager.co.th is ranked 14 in Thailand (a
nation of over 65 million people)
by Alexa and rivals Russia's RT in
readership. This is a promising first step in holding a real, fully informed
debate regarding the political future of Thailand, Southeast Asia, and
globalization in general.
Sondhi also mentioned
America's "Pacific
Century," which includes integrating ASEAN not only as a regional superstate
to rival China, but to integrate all of Asia into the Wall Street/London
international order, or as Sondhi referred to it, the "Washington
Consensus."
Those behind this creeping integration, analogous to that of the European
Union implemented incrementally against the will of the people, will now
have to face an increasingly informed public who will realize and begin
balking the rise of globalization long before early successes built on
deception take them by surprise.
Lifting the Rock,
Exposing the Snake
It should be mentioned that following Sondhi's presentation, US State
Department-funded Prachatai immediately responded by insisting that its
millions of baht a year from the US government via NED "has no bearing on
its news coverage."
This even after
NED's open involvement with
undermining and overthrowing governments throughout the Arab World during
2011 has become a matter of public record, including a full admission
printed in the New York Times titled, "U.S. Groups Helped Nurture Arab
Uprisings," which stated:
"A number of the groups and individuals
directly involved in the revolts and reforms sweeping the region,
including the April 6 Youth Movement in Egypt, the Bahrain Center for
Human Rights and grass-roots activists like Entsar Qadhi, a youth leader
in Yemen, received training and financing from groups like the
International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute
and Freedom House, a nonprofit human rights organization based in
Washington."
The article would also add, regarding the US
National Endowment for Democracy (NED):
"The Republican and Democratic institutes
are loosely affiliated with the Republican and Democratic Parties. They
were created by Congress and are financed through the National Endowment
for Democracy, which was set up in 1983 to channel grants for promoting
democracy in developing nations.
The National Endowment receives about $100
million annually from Congress. Freedom House also gets the bulk of its
money from the American government, mainly from the State Department."
NED's duplicity is nothing new.
Noam Chomsky in
1993 said of NED's projects in Nicaragua that,
"it's about what you would expect from a
bipartisan democracy campaign - it's an attempt to impose what is called
democracy, meaning rule by the rich and the powerful, without
interference by the mob but within the framework of formal electoral
procedures."
Additionally it was noted in Australia's
Southern Cross University's "Activating Human Rights & Peace (AHRP)"
conference through
a revealing account of their 2008 proceedings that NED
was carrying out,
"a lot of work that was formerly undertaken by the CIA."
Also considering NED's Board of Directors, a who's who of corporate fascism,
Neo-Conservatism, and warmongering elitists, one must wonder why a Thai
"independent" rights advocate is taking money from such people even if
taking the money has "no bearing on its news coverage."
Included on
NED's Board of Directors:
-
Francis Fukuyama: Neo-Con, Project for a
New American Century (PNAC) signatory, pro-war
-
Zalmay Khalilzad: Neo-Con PNAC
signatory, pro-war + corporate lobbyist
-
Will Marshall: Neo-Con PNAC signatory,
pro-war
-
Vin Weber: Neo-Con PNAC signatory,
pro-war + corporate lobbyist
-
Richard Gephardt: pro-war, corporate
lobbyist for
big-pharma, Boeing & Ford Motor Co.
-
John Bohn: petrochemicals, corporate
consultant & international banker for 13 years
-
Rita DiMartino: CFR, AT&T "Vice
President of Congressional Relations"
-
Kenneth Duberstein: Boeing,
ConocoPhillips, Mack-Cali Realty, CFR member & Fannie Mac
-
William Galston: Brookings Institution
-
Moises Naim: Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace
-
Robert Miller: corporate lawyer
-
Larry Liebenow: US Chamber of Commerce
(a chief proponent of
SOPA), Center for International Private
Enterprise
-
Patricia Friend: AFL-CIO (a proponent of
SOPA)
Indeed, Prachatai and NGOs like it have a lot to
answer for.
Like lifting a rock under which a venomous snake
hides, Sondhi has exposed not just Prachatai, but the greater globalist plot
against Thailand within which Prachatai plays a role. Now are dangerous
times for Thailand and the world as a whole. As nations begin lifting up the
rocks and shining the light of truth on the globalist agenda, the
corporate-financier elite have two options, strike out or run.
The truth and scale of the crimes committed by the global elite means that
running is out of the question. There is no where for a global criminal to
run to when the entire planet is the crime scene.
They will strike, the question is - will we be
ready?
Sondhi, for his part, has already had an
attempt made on his life. In April
2009, gunmen sprayed his vehicle in broad daylight with over a hundred
bullets. One bullet grazed his head but he ultimately survived the ordeal.

by armed "critics" from opposing political cliques, most likely those of
Thaksin and his UDD -
notorious for their acts of murder and mayhem.
By adding our voices behind those daring to
speak the truth, we make it less effective to commit acts of violence
against individuals exposing the system.
No doubt there will be many displeased with his
most recent and thorough presentation exposing the tentacles of Wall
Street's 0.1% making their way into Thailand using the camouflage of,
-
"human
rights"
-
"democracy"
-
"freedom of speech",
... to mask their true intent.
Camouflage is decidedly less effective when one
knows what to look for.
A predator or parasite depending on this rouse will
be considerably less effective in an environment of informed vigilance.
Let us continue to undermine the abilities of
this predatory-parasitic system by continuing to speak to the truth,
identity the source of their corporate-financier power, boycott and entirely
replace their self-serving system with one that serves the interests of we
the people.
By getting active we help diminish the abilities
of the global elite and make attempts of violence against those leading the
cause of freedom more difficult and less viable, not only in Thailand, but
around the globe.
