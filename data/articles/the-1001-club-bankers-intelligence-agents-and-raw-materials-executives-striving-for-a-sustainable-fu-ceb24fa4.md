Note:
if you look up information on the
1001 Club on the internet you'll find that the group is listed on
Wikipedia's WWF page.
The author has added
it there several years back, but any attempt to add additional information -
however basic - has always been blocked.
Now that membership lists have been
made available with this article, I suggest people expand on the 1001 Club
information on Wikipedia and see to it that it doesn't get sanitized.
Whether you search in Dutch, French, German, English, American, or
South-African newspapers of the past 35 years, you will find that there is
virtually no information available on a private association naming itself
the 1001 Club. Even in the Netherlands, where Prince Bernhard's involvement
with Bilderberg should be widely known by now, absolutely no one has heard
of his role in creating "the 1001".
The only official information available about
this club - which the average person is very unlikely to stumble upon - is
that it was established in the early seventies by individuals as
Prince Bernhard, Prince
Philip, Charles de Haes, and Anton Rupert, and that every member paid a one
time fee of $10,000 to get lifetime membership - that's about it.
This almost total absence of public awareness
seems odd, as the men visiting 1001 Club receptions often represent some of
the greatest economic interests on the planet.
Background of the WWF and the
1001
In 1948, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources (IUCN) was erected, mainly by Sir Julian Huxley,
a famous biologist. Later, in September 1961, Julian Huxley officially
established the WWF, together with persons like Prince Bernhard and Prince
Philip.
Ten years later, around 1971, WWF officials
Anton Rupert, Prince Philip, and Prince Bernhard came together and decided
to form a club that would cover the administrative and fundraising aspects
of the WWF, making the organization's existence independent from donations
of the general public.
Anton Rupert is said to have been the one
who came up with the idea.
Bernhard became the "figurehead" of the
organization, a role similar to his role in
the Bilderberg meetings. Bernhard was well
liked, knew many people on both sides of the Atlantic, and as a prince, was
considered neutral. Anton Rupert appointed the Belgian economist Charles
de Haes as Bernhard's personal assistant.
Bernhard and de Haes would approach most of the
individuals who would be invited to the 1001 Club, which mainly were friends
and associates of the two princes. In 1974, all the members were recruited,
each of them having paid the one-time contribution of $10,000 to the Club's
"1001 Nature Trust".
From this point on, we have very little
information on how the club organizes its meetings and how much each of the
members keep contributing.

Club meetings
Press reports about the 1001 Club have been extremely sporadic. Possibly the
only serious exposé on the club was published in 1980 by Private Eye.
One of the questions this magazine asked was:
"The puzzling question is what do the '1001'
get for their money apart from private prestige and the privilege of
dining with Prince Bernhard or the Duke of Edinburgh?" [1]
We'll leave the answer to this question for
later.
The mentioning of diners indicates that the 1001
Club is organized in the same way as many other establishment clubs,
including the prestigious
Pilgrims Society. An initial problem when
writing this article was that it was difficult to determine whether or not
the 1001 still existed - information was extremely scarce to say the least.
One thing that could be found was that new members were still invited in
1996.
On the website of Buttonboss Plc. we can
read
in the history section:
"Buttonboss celebrated its 20th Anniversary
and, once again, Prince Bernhard honored us with his presence in
attending the spectacular celebration party in Twente (Holland).
It was
on this occasion that he, in name of fellow members of the selection
committee, offered Henk Brusse membership of the '1001-Club', for which
he was responsible in founding.
This club compromises 1001 good friends
and relations of H.R.H. Prince Bernhard, all of whom support the
world-wide activities associated with the World Wild Life Nature Fund."
The next step was to contact several branches of
the World Wildlife Fund for Nature and ask them about the 1001.
On August 10, 2005, the Dutch branch of the WWF
finally confirmed that meetings were still being organized:
"I received your question about the
1001-Club. Regular meetings indeed do take place. The location is
different every time.
For instance, last April there has been a Panda
Ball in Monaco and a diner in Barcelona... Could you please inform me
why you are interested in this information?"
In the email the question was asked if the
meetings were held in London.
The WWF employee said that although it's very
likely that meetings have been organized here too, that they were held in
various countries. A very brief 1978 report in The Times confirms that
Prince Philip gave a reception at Windsor castle for 1001 Club members
[2].
A leaked, confidential internal report of the
1001 Club furthermore confirms that Prince Bernhard regularly organized
receptions at Soestdijk Palace for Dutch 1001 Club members, and that King
Juan Carlos organized his own receptions in Spain for Spanish members.
According to this last report, international meetings have also been
organized on a regular basis. [3] One example of these
international trips/meetings appears to have been a five-day trip to Nepal
of some thirty 1001 Club members. The excursion was headed by Prince
Bernhard [4].
Three days after uploading the initial 1001 Club article (the site was
visited by WWF headquarters in Switzerland for some time after the emails
had been sent) and five weeks after sending them an email, the British
branch of the WWF finally decided to reply (it should normally take two days
max).
They confirmed the 1001 Club was still
organizing meetings and added to it that the one-time introduction fee had
been increased to $25,000.
"I have been in discussions with our major
support section in order to find all the information that you require
about the 1001 club.
There is a one off membership fee of $25,000 (US
Dollars) and there are field trips and events organised mainly by WWF
International. If you have further queries please come back to us..."
This short message took them five weeks! And why
did this person have to go in "discussions" to receive "all this
information"?
Needles to say, we did get back to them and
asked them whether or not the regular staff has actually heard of the 1001
Club, or if all this information is held behind closed doors within the WWF
headquarters. The answer came after about three weeks, on September 5, 2005.
If we skip the usual apology for the delay, the
whole email read:
"I would like to inform you that the 1001
Club is a scheme run by WWF-International, which is situated in
Switzerland, and for detailed information we have to contact WWF-International."
As expected, the answer doesn't tell us a whole
lot.
Anyway, if you have a thousand members with an average age of 45-50 years or
so, you'd expect that at least an average of about twenty people die each
year.
Twenty new members who each pay the $25,000 introduction fee is a
baseline income for the 1001 Club of at least $500,000 annually.
Difference between the
1001 and the Pilgrims
The Anglo-American Pilgrims Society is a good society to compare the 1001
Club with.
Both are very aristocratic and very low profile social clubs.
Both are international and have originated from England. The two are also
comparable in size, with considerable overlap in membership when it comes to
British or, to some extent, American members.
There are also differences, the most obvious being that members of the 1001
Club are recruited from all over the world.
There are:
-
Conrad Black and Maurice Strong from
Canada
-
Henry Ford II and Robert McNamara from
the United States
-
Antenor Patino and Gustavo Cisneros from
Latin America
-
Sir Peter Cadbury and Lord Buxton from
the United Kingdom
-
Hilmar Reksten and Alf Bjercke from
Norway
-
Henk Brusse and Ferdinand Grapperhaus
from the Netherlands
-
Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza and Berthold
Beitz (Krupp) from Germany
-
Egmond Frommelt and Herbert Batliner
from Liechtenstein
-
Mobutu Sese Seko and Salay Edu from
Africa
-
Mohammed Al-Naki and Agha Abedi from the
Middle-East
-
Gyanendra Dev from Nepal
-
Sir Kenneth Fung and Sir Y.K. Pao from
Hong Kong
In contrast, the Pilgrims Society is strictly
Anglo-American.
Nobility and royalty in the 1001:
-
Prince Hans Adam II of Liechtenstein,
who is trying to become the absolute ruler of his country
-
Gyanendra Dev with Prince Philip, right
after Dev's family had been murdered almost entirely by his nephew
Crown Prince Dipendra
-
King Juan Carlos, who doesn't mind
shooting endangered species
-
Prince Johannes von Thurn und Taxis who
seems to have been involved in underhand business with leading
Cercle members
-
Baron Heinrich II "Heini" von
Thyssen-Bornemisza, nephew of the notorious Fritz Thyssen
Another difference between members of the
Pilgrims Society and the 1001 Club is that Pilgrims virtually always remain
highly respected individuals from high society throughout their life,
whereas a considerable amount of 1001 Club members have fallen from grace
over the years.
Among the examples are
-
Mobutu Sese Seko, the ruthless dictator
of Zaire
-
drug and arms trader Robert Vesco
-
arms/gold/diamond smuggler Sheikh Ali
Ahmed
-
the hard-right, anti-communist financier
Nelson Bunker Hunt
-
Mossad agent and money launderer Tibor
Rosembaum
-
Zionist agent Louis Mortimer Bloomfield
-
Salem Bin Laden, the half brother of
Osama Bin Laden
-
Agha Hasan Abedi of the BCCI
-
Zionist/mafia-linked bankers as (Mrs.)
Edgar de Picciotto and Edmond Safra
There are leading figures from respectable banks
and corporations, but overall the 1001 has a much more mixed crowd.
Because of all the foreign interests, persons
representing the Vatican-Paneuropa network and Zionism are also considerably
more prominent in the 1001 Club than the predominantly Episcopal and
Presbyterian Pilgrims Society.
Land grabbing and
covert operations
As Private Eye magazine asked: what is the real purpose of the 1001
Club?
Private Eye suspected that the real
motive of many businessmen joining the 1001 has a lot to do with them
seeking new ways to expand their business operations, in this case by using
the WWF and the 1001 Club as a platform to casually meet the leaders of
third world countries who control a substantial amount of the planet's
natural resources.
This accusation is actually quite hard to substantiate.
There are a number
of British and American 1001 Club members who represent great oil, mineral,
and shipping interests, but only a small number of third world political
leaders can be found among the membership (Mobutu is probably the biggest
exception).
Of course, the 1001 Club remains a good place to
meet important persons from various countries around the world, but the
question is if this is the primary purpose for members to join.
1001 Club members (above image):
-
Sidney Spiro
-
Harry Oppenheimer
-
Sir Val Duncan
-
Maurice Strong
-
Sir Eric Drake
They represented corporations and banks as
Anglo-American, De Beers, Charter, Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Iranian Oil
Company and BP, the British Newfoundland Corporation, Société Générale
pour l'Energie et les Ressources, the International Energy Development
Corporation, P&O shipping, the Bank of England, Barclays and Hambro.
To a large extent the 1001 Club seems to be just
what it is supposed to be: a group of influential people concerned about the
environment.
However, as kings and emperors have shown over
the centuries, it's perfectly possible to enjoy nature and not care anything
for the common man. Striving for a sustainable future can be a very elitist
thing.
We all need fresh air and clean water. On top of that, many bankers
and industrialists of the western world list among their hobbies such
activities as hiking, fishing, visiting faraway places, and above all...
hunting.
An ever-expanding world population seriously
gets in the way of these things.
Although no politician or journalist will burn his fingers on this topic,
helping people of third world countries is actually quite problematic from a
strictly geopolitical point of view.
The reasons:
-
it may upset the balance of power
-
there aren't enough natural resources to
support 6,5 billion people with a high standard of living
The economic power clique of the West seems to
have realized this, judging from internal documents that leaked from the
World Bank in recent years.
These documents described the process through
which the IMF and World Bank crush third world countries economically by
extending their loans only after the leaders of the respective countries
have accepted secret and very far-reaching policies of privatization and
deregulation. [5]
The eccentric financial expert Jean-Pierre
van Rossem may have said it best:
"The whole third world is indebted to the
banks. And it really is the financial power clique that keeps these
countries poor. Why does poverty continue? Because it has a purpose."
[6]
The bankers and industrialists of the Eastern
Establishment have traditionally been very involved in suppressing Latin
American trade unions, while anti-communist hardliners, mainly from the
United States and Israel, have been training death squads in Latin America
since at least the early 1980s.
There has been a degree of antagonism
between these two groups, mainly about the degree of support for radical
Zionism, but the lines are hard to define.
Britain too has tried to find ways to remain an influence in the world, and
some have argued over the years that British Intelligence and the Foreign
Office have tried to use the WWF (and 1001 Club) to pursue some of the
country's geopolitical interests.
The most important of these critics has
been the Irish journalist Kevin Dowling, who in 1990 produced the
documentary 'Ten Pence in the Panda', in which he documented the extreme
ineffectiveness of the WWF's efforts to defend species as the panda, the
elephant, and the black rhino.
During the controversy in the weeks and months
after the documentary, Dowling produced more damning evidence against the
WWF.
It turned out that the people living in the
reserves were forced to live under inhumane conditions (and could be shot on
sight), that wealthy customers could illegally hunt on rhinos and elephants,
that leading nature conservatives were involved in the illegal trade in
ivory, and that criminal special operations were launched from nature
reserves to sustain the apartheid system. [7]
The Dutch Attorney J. Wilgers in more recent years looked into the
work of Kevin Dowling and reached similar conclusions.
According to Wilgers, the IUCN and the WWF (and
therefore also the 1001 Club) have been created as fronts for British
neo-colonial policies:
"In 1948, the IUCN, the International Union
for the Conservation of Nature, was established. The most important
person involved was Julian
Huxley.
This IUCN had a close working relationship with the British Colonial and
Foreign Office. All his life Huxley had been working on projects related
to the conservation of nature.
In 1960, he made a trip through the British
colonies that were about to become independent.
He made sure that the
British government was able to keep their hold on the nature reserves
located in the countries of the Commonwealth, even today.
Somehow he was
able to convince the new African leaders that every person from Africa
was a natural born poacher.
"Great Britain has always been preoccupied with the capture of raw
materials from the countries in the Commonwealth and the protection of
the unlimited supply of it.
It is noteworthy that the IUCN still has the
affix, "for natural resources" [International Union for Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources].
I also point to the fact that the IUCN is an
extension of the government offices and the public sector of the United
Kingdom, because in the end, these are the real beneficiaries.
A year
after Huxley's trip, the WWF was established with the sole purpose of
gathering funds for the IUCN. The IUCN went to the background at the
moment the WWF came into existence...
"Thirty years later, the WWF controls 10% of the world's surface. They
control 40% of Tanzania. At the moment they are focused on
South-America.
This is something of the last 5 years [since 1994-1995]."
[8]
It's no secret that a crucial aspect of the
West's prosperity has to do with its reasonably inexpensive access to bulk
materials as oil and precious metals around the world.
If these supplies were to dry up, or become too
expensive to import, the economy of the West would collapse totally and
permanently.
One person who understood that very good was Sir
Julian Amery, one of the most important behind the scenes players in
post WWII Britain.
"The prosperity of our people rests really
on the oil in the Persian Gulf, the rubber and tin of Malaya, and the
gold, copper and precious metals of South- and Central Africa.
As long
as we have access to these; as long as we can realize the investments we
have there; as long as we trade with this part of the world, we shall be
prosperous. If the communists [or anyone else] were to take them over,
we would lose the lot.
Governments like Colonel Nasser's in Egypt are
just as dangerous." [9]
Amery made these remarks in late 1962, after
Egypt had sent troops to Yemen in order to prevent domestic forces from
bringing back the ousted Imam.
The British had a Crown colony in the south,
Aden, but realized they were not a superpower anymore and could do little to
defend their overseas interests.
Overtly that is, as Amery and his good friend
David Stirling, founder of the SAS, soon approached Sir Alec Douglas
Home, Foreign Secretary at the time, in the White's Club to discuss their
plan of a covert war.
Julian Amery, who would become head of
Le Cercle in the 1980s.
Billy McLean, Prince Turki
Al-Faisal and the King of Jordan
would all become members of
this international private intelligence group.
The idea was that Stirling would be send to
Yemen with a group of ex-SAS men and train the local royalist groups, who
were supporters of the deposed Imam. Under the leadership of the SAS, they
would then undermine the Egyptian forces.
Stirling approached the Saudi House of
Al-Faisal, who agreed to fund the entire operation. Weapons were delivered
by Adnan Khashoggi; the arms dealer's first major contract. Stirling
also received support from the King of Jordan.
The Mossad and former MI6
officers as George Kennedy Young and Billy McLean (another close friend of
Amery) were also involved in the secret war.
The operation was a huge
success and in August 1965 the Egyptians had been so tied down that they
were forced to sign a cease-fire with the Saudis, the main overt supporters
of the Yemeni resistance, and begin their withdrawal.
Unfortunately for Stirling and Amery, Wilson had
recently entered office and began withdrawing British forces all over the
world. Yemen would soon be taken over by communist-sponsored elements in
society.
To prevent this from happening in Saudi Arabia, which had been left
virtually defenseless by the British withdrawal, Stirling and his business
associates managed to sell an Air Force to Saudi Arabia, maintained by SAS
mercenaries.
The deal would bring many other business
opportunities in the future. [10]
Although private interests, especially banks, always had a great deal of
influence on the British government (or on any government), the events in
Yemen is considered the start of not only the privatization of British
foreign policy, but also of covert warfare. The result was not unlike a
diluted version of the historic British East-India Company or Cecil Rhodes'
British South Africa Company.
And herein lies the problem: even though someone
like Stirling was quite brilliant in his own way, the group he hung out with
was a combination of robber barons, imperialists and fascists.
Examples are
John Aspinall, Lord Lucan, Sir James Goldsmith, Tiny Rowland, the Cecil
family and Lord Julian Amery.
Especially the last four had many connections
to the leading aristocracy (they were part of it), the business community
and international intelligence.
They became involved in funding and training
rebel groups across Africa; officially to counter the Soviet threat,
unofficially to retain control over the minerals in that area. In itself not
that much of problem, although human rights have never been a point of
consideration for these people, who also supported dictators like Franco,
Pinochet, Mobutu and Ian Smith.
Rowland, together with Adnan Khashoggi, did a
lot of business with Ghaddafi [11]. These two picked up where
"rogue" CIA agent Edwin Wilson left off 10 years earlier.
One operation in particular would be damning to the British establishment if
it were to be fully exposed. Men like the 7th Marquess of Salisbury (Cecil)
and Julian Amery, both leading members of the international private
intelligence group
Le Cercle, were strong supporters of the
apartheid governments in Africa [12].
The accusation is that when
it became obvious in the 1980s that the apartheid system was breaking down,
British fascists set up private SAS operations in southern Africa to counter
this movement, largely in the same manner as the operation in Yemen about 25
years earlier.
Retired SAS officers operated through front
companies. One of those was
KAS Enterprises, a private security firm
first headed by David Stirling, and when he died in 1990, by Sir
James Goldsmith. Officially, KAS was hired to protect elephants and
rhinos from poachers in southern Africa. They were authorized to use deadly
force.
However, soon people began to notice that a
disproportionally large amount of the people killed were ANC activists, many
of them part of the armed resistance.
Even though reportedly 1,5 million
people ended up dead, the operation of bringing a halt to majority rule was
unsuccessful.
Attention was now shifted to South Africa alone and an attempt
was made to destabilize the country to such an extent that the military of
the apartheid government could step in and declare martial law.
The idea was to set up the ANC against the
Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom Party, respectively the largest and
second largest anti-apartheid movements in South Africa.
The tactic was to
train black units, like the Anti-Cattle Thieves Brigade and the
Crowbar Unit, and to have them commit terrorist actions in the black
townships. This was to lead to a civil war followed by a military crackdown.
The operation killed several ten thousand
people, but accomplished nothing; in 1994 the apartheid system was history.
Interestingly, a South African report about
Operation Lock, as the project was called, was suppressed by the Mandela
government as it was considered "too explosive".
Press releases did however
indicate that the SAS, in part through KAS, was the origin of the mysterious
"third force", blamed for the campaign of terrorism and assassinations.
[13]
KAS had been hired by "wealthy conservatives", although besides Prince
Bernhard, names do not seem to have been released. It is also not known how
much these men knew, or wanted to know, about the secondary operations of
KAS.
Kevin Dowling:
"I discovered that in the so-called wildlife
parks a system of total repression existed. People don't have any
rights, their traditional way of income is forbidden.
They can't even
step on a flower without running the risk of being murdered.
At the same time these so-called wildlife
parks turned out to function as staging grounds and training camps for
all kinds of mercenaries.
South-Africa stationed its secret troops there
which had to sow death and destruction in the townships of South-Africa
and the frontline states, while also the terrorists of Renamo and Unita
liked to hide out there. ...
"Because I had so many contacts in Africa by that time, I was being
overwhelmed with information about Project Lock. I discovered that very
heavy guys were involved in the operation.
The military branch of the
operation was under the command of Colonel Ian Crooke, the second man of
the special forces in England, the SAS....
Furthermore, in the Lock network I found the
name of Gordon Shepard. That is a kind of dirty tricks [specialist of
MI6 who used to work in Northern Ireland] ...
There were people of Kroll
Associates, a kind of private intelligence service of Wall Street. In
short, it was a real heavy group, an old-boy network in which the WWF,
the SAS, MI5 and MI6 plus some CIA guys and private intelligence
services brotherly came together.
The civilian side of the operation was
headed by John Hanks, Prince Bernhard's right-hand man in Africa."
[14]
J. Wilgers, who was inspired by the work
of Kevin Dowling, did his own research and reached similar
conclusions:
"During that time these people trained a
number of elite black units in the wildlife parks [of the Peace Parks
Foundation and the WWF]...
I have seen that these projects were
completely financed by the World Wide Fund for Nature.
Of course a
certain Prince [Bernhard] has been involved in that, who has walked
around there with a suitcase full of money, but the question remains how
much this man knew about the projects..."
"It is known that in the past SAS units of the British army have been
flown into South-Africa and were stationed on territory controlled by
the WWF with the purpose of conducting military operations...
Military
units have been trained in these kinds of parks and were later brought
in connection with murders in the South-African townships.
In the Zambezi-Valley, members of the
military wing of the ANC have been shot at from WWF helicopters. The
Zambesi-Valley was the primary entrance into South-Africa.
Under the
cover of fighting poachers ANC members have been executed without any
form of trial. I call that an undeclared war or genocide..."
"There are 2 types of parks: nature parks and strategic parks. The
official purpose of the nature parks is the protection of nature. Often,
these parks contain important minerals like diamond or uranium.
Locals are encouraged to leave or simply
chased away.
Type 2 are the strategic parks. If you look carefully
you'll find that these parks are either located on certain ridges useful
for military observation, or they are border transcending parks like for
example those in South-Africa and Mozambique...
It is remarkable that corridors have been
projected in such a way that they cleverly combine the preservation of
nature with the gaining of a military advantage." [15]
WWF map from a 2001.
New parks have been created
in the mean time.
Wilgers was persecuted by the WWF for making
public statements that the World Wide Fund for Nature is a criminal
enterprise.
Unfortunately for the WWF, they lost their case,
although they never had to admit that Wilgers was right in his accusations.
Wilgers wasn't "knowingly speaking untruths", it was concluded [16].
Years later, I made a call to Mr. Wilgers, who
stated that the 1001 Club is directed by the Privy Council and MI6. This now
turns out to be similar to the leadership of
Le Cercle.
All British chairmen of Le Cercle were deeply involved with British and foreign intelligence, and the
last three were members of the Privy Council.
It may be possible that these so called 'strategic parks' might not be
limited to Southern Africa.
For instance, if you take a look at Pakistan,
the "ally" of the United States in the
War
on Terror (and significantly represented in the 1001 Club, in
part through the Bhutto family), you'll see five major national parks in the
north of the country.
One is located at the border with India, another
at the border with China, and yet another one at the border with northern
Afghanistan.
The management of these parks works closely with the IUCN and
the WWF. The Aga Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP) of 1001 Club
member Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan is another partner in many of the
same projects in that area.
It's hard to say if these parks are used for
some type of military operations, but they certainly are conveniently
located.
Three major parks bordering
the surrounding countries.
More detailed geographical
info can be found at the websites cited.
Although the picture seems to
indicate that two of the parks
are located some distance
from the border, in reality they extend right to the border.
The human-induced
global warming agenda
A formerly unsubstantial aspect of the environment movement, the idea that
CO2 is causing global warming, has become a very hot item since
former vice president Al Gore came out with his documentary 'An
Inconvenient Truth' in 2006.
1001 Club members
David Rockefeller,
Edmund de Rothschild, and
Maurice Strong (not to mention James
Baker III) already promoted an agenda in the 1980s that their associate
Al Gore only really put on the map in 2006 with his film 'An
Inconvenient Truth'.
At these early meetings, Strong
introduced Edmund the Rothschild as the founder of the "conservation
banking" program.
The audio recordings are hard to dispute,
but let's hope the document produced by George Hunt in which these
people describe using the United Nations to take over the world is not
true. (see old introduction article for details)
The Gore family has
intermarried with the Schiff family of The Pilgrims and the Wildlife
Conservation Society.
Gore's closest ally in his global warming
campaign is Theodore Roosevelt IV, another establishment family whose
members for decades have been top-level CIA officers and in one case an
anti-Establishment (disinformation) propagandist.
Family members also
were great fascist appeasers who supported the overthrow of FDR in favor
of a more "right wing" government (see Pilgrims Society article for the
details).
You can find this latest Theodore Roosevelt
in such organizations as the Alliance for Climate Protection
(vice chair under Gore), the Pew Center for Global Climate Change
(chairman), the World Resources Institute, and the Wilderness
Society.
Maurice Strong is also still very active
today. He is chairman of the Earth Council Alliance and sits on
the board of the Chicago Climate Exchange, a CO2
trading scheme.
Since that time the media has bombarded Western
society with the "undeniable fact" that the earth is heating up, that we
humans are the cause of it, and that if we fail to make drastic changes, a
large portion of the earth's population will die in horrible cataclysms.
The problem with Al Gore's theories is that they are terribly lopsided, as
documentaries as Channel 4's 'The
Great Global Warming Swindle' and CBC's 'Global Warming Doomsday
Called Off' have shown.
Although the former may take a slightly too
biased approach from a skeptical point of view, both documentaries clearly
show that 'An Inconvenient Truth' is nothing more than a crude propaganda
piece.
The changes the earth - not to mention other planets in the solar
system - is going through are likely to be nothing more than a natural cycle
largely caused by the sun's increased energy output.
Unfortunately for the world, Al Gore is backed by the most
powerful interests in the Anglo-American liberal establishment,
resulting in almost zero opposition to
the theory that human-produced CO2
is the major cause for the warming of the earth.
The WWF is just one establishment institute that
blindly supports Al Gore's theories.
Looking at their websites, other
organizations promoting the ideas of Al Gore are:
-
the Business and Industry Advisory
Committee of the OECD
-
the International Chamber of Commerce
-
the James A. Baker III Institute for
Public Policy
-
the Rockefeller Brothers Fund
-
the Carnegie network
The Carnegie Endowment alone makes large annual
grants to numerous
United Nations programs, to
the
CFR, the
Royal Institute of International Affairs,
and the Atlantic Council of the United States, not to mention dozens of
universities in the United States (including Harvard, Yale, and Princeton).
It works closely with the Ford Foundation, the
MacArthur Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.
Al Gore would be the perfect 1001 Club member, and he could well be
one.
Unfortunately there are no recent membership lists available, so the
only thing that can be concluded is that Gore's mentors have been among the
membership of the 1001: Maurice Strong, Edmund de Rothschild, and David
Rockefeller.
As has been documented quite extensively in
ISGP's old introduction article, these are the people who set up the
globalist-environmental agenda in the 1970s and 1980s, and were the earliest
funders and promoters of human-induced global warming theories.
And they are still involved.
Return to Al Gore and "An Inconvenient Truth"...

Controversial members
Just as
Le Cercle, a lot of members of the 1001
Club have a remarkably controversial background. Below you can find examples
of some the more controversial and-or remarkable individuals.

"David Stirling was a close friend of
Julian Amery's and together they were determined to find a way to
stop Nasser... Stirling and Amery had diner with the foreign
secretary, Alec Douglas Hume, at the White's Club in St. James's.
They proposed a plan: a group of SAS men would mount an operation to
fight the Egyptians, but they would do it privately."
[10] Ibid. This documentary does not discuss
the role of George Kennedy Young, Billy McLean and the Mossad.
May 1990, Issue 19, Lobster, 'The final testimony of George Kennedy
Young - Introduction' (written by Young himself):
"However Nasser did get his uppance.
Young had already left MI6 for merchant banking when Mossad
approached him to find an Englishman acceptable to the Saudis to run
a guerrilla war against the left-wing Yemeni regime and its Egyptian
backers. 'I can find you a Scotsman', replied Young, and over a
lunch in the City introduced Colonel Neil ('Billy') Maclean to
Brigadier Dan Hiram, the Israeli Defence Attaché. The Israelis
promised to supply weapons, funds and instructors who could pass
themselves off as Arabs, and the Saudis eagerly grasped the idea.
Maclean's irregulars restored the Imam's rule and Nasser pulled out
his troops whose morale had been badly shaken by the Yemeni practice
of sending back captured troops with their lips cut cut off in a
ghastly grin."
[11] A few examples to make the point that
the group Stirling hung out with were robber barons, imperialist and
fascists:
-
1999, Adam Curtis, 'The Mayfair Set':
-
"In 1962, John Aspinall opened his own gambling club, the Clermont
Club in Mayfair. Stirling was one of its members... [Other members]
included James Goldsmith, a playboy and ferocious gambler who is to
become a close friend of Stirling's; the tycoon Tiny Rowland, who
Stirling already knew from his time in Africa; Lord Lucan, the
descendant of the man who led the charge of the Light Brigade; and
Jim Slater, the takeover tycoon and asset stripper who ran the
notorious Slater Walker. What united all these men was a belief in
decisive reckless action. It was this, they believed, had made
Britain great; not moderate post-war governments."
-
January 9, 2005, The Observer,
'Desperate Lucan dreamt of fascist coup':
-
"when he [Lucan] left Hatchards, the book under his arm was a Thirties translation of
Hitler's political testament, Mein Kampf ... The Countess of Lucan
confirmed this weekend that Lucan was an extremist in his politics:
'He did have very right-wing views, some might describe them as
fascist.
I didn't know he was indulging in extremist reading matter
in 1972, although I knew he listened to recordings of Hitler's
speeches at Nuremburg Rallies... he [Lucan] and his associates, who
included casino owner and party host John Aspinall, and the tycoon
Sir James Goldsmith, were increasingly convinced Britain had fallen
victim to a socialist conspiracy.
Daily Express journalist Charles Benson,
one of Lucan's friends, said:
One biographer, Patrick Marnham, said:
-
'Seen from the Clermont Club
[Lucan's favourite gambling haunt], the country was starting to
resemble the less stable years of the Weimar Republic. Sir James
Goldsmith began to develop his theory of "the Communist
infiltration of the Western media". Over the smoked salmon and
lamb cutlets, the talk turned to the pros and cons of a British
military coup... His marriage had collapsed, gambling debts were
crushing him and he had become convinced Britain was going to
the dogs.
In his growing desperation, he had convinced himself
that his wife was unfit to bring up his three children and had
spent the previous year trying to get her committed to mental
institutions. In fact, the 7th Earl of Lucan, who disappeared in
November 1974 after the murder of the family nanny [Goldsmith is
said to have flown him out of the country], was himself growing
increasingly unstable.'"
Brian Crozier, former head of Le Cercle
and a great defender of Francoism, was a close associate of
Goldsmith in the failed effort of getting Franz Josef Strauss (of Le
Cercle) elected chancellor of Germany. Strauss was a good friend of
Francoist ultrafascists as Federico Silva Munoz (Le Cercle) and
Gonzalo Fernandez de la Mora.
These two were also defended by Crozier.
-
July 27, 1998, The Financial Times, 'The
talented but ultimately unacceptable face of capitalism':
-
"Mr Rowland, born Roland Walter
Fuhrhop, of a German father and Anglo-Dutch mother in India in
1917, was a natural outsider and maverick. Educated first in
Germany, then briefly in England, he was detained on the Isle of
Man during the war, where he was suspected of Nazi sympathies."
-
August 16, 1992, Sunday Times, 'Gadaffi
to buy 'SAS package' from Khashoggi':
-
"Colonel Gadaffi, the Libyan leader,
is recruiting disaffected former members of South Africa's
special forces to train his commandos... Gadaffi is also seeking
to buy large amounts of top-quality military equipment,
including a sophisticated radar air defence system, American
M-40 anti-tank weapons, and NBC combat suits designed to protect
troops against the effects of nuclear, biological or chemical
attack.
According to documents obtained by
The Sunday Times, the
secret deal of special forces training and equipment for Libya
has been negotiated by Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi arms dealer
recently involved in a controversial partnership between Gadaffi
and Tiny Rowland... the relationship has blossomed, with both
Khashoggi and Rowland promising Libya political influence in the
West..."
-
According to Wikipedia, John Aspinall
once claimed that Britain was in need of "a Franco-ite
counter-revolution".
-
1999, Adam Curtis, 'The Mayfair Set'
(John Aspinall speaking):
-
"Some people actually seek risk, and
they put themselves at risk voluntarily. And I think this is a
spirit that is to be admired. I think it's the spirit that built
the prosperity that everybody in this country is enjoying today
was created by adventurers; by merchants-adventurers; by pirats
if you like, like [Henry] Morgan and [Sir Francis] Drake."
Morgan and Drake worked in part on their
own and in part for the British Crown during the war against the
(Catholic) Spaniards. Most people would probably agree with the
first part of the statement, but many would become worried when a
businessmen's idols are pirates like Morgan and Drake.
-
March 13, 2006, Daily Mail, 'A very
British Coup':
-
"As for Colonel David Stirling,...
he too believed the situation in Britain had become so serious
that a military coup had to be an option. According to his
friend, Major Alexander Greenwood, Stirling also offered a more
informal way of handling the trades union agitators - provoking
them into a confrontation. 'He thought: "Let's attack the
leaders, let's get them run over by a bus - then they'll start
thinking," ' says Major Greenwood, who had become a stockbroker
after his Army career."
-
September 5, 1996, The Independent,
Julian Amery's obituary:
-
"He threw himself with zest into the
role of a backbencher, intervening, in that great, rumbling
voice of his, on a wide variety of subjects but, increasingly,
in support of the rebel Rhodesian government headed by Ian
Smith, thus showing he was his Imperialist father's son to the
core... When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979 his
first major foreign challenge was the conference of Commonwealth
Prime Ministers in Lusaka in the autumn, where the main topic
was to be Rhodesia (the government of which was now headed by
Bishop Abel Muzorewa, with Smith in close attendance).
Rhodesia was the main subject in the
adjournment debate of 25 July, the last occasion for discussion
of the matter before the summer recess. The Prime Minister took
great care over her speech, seeking to placate both those who
wanted to bring Muzorewa and Smith down, and the many on the
Conservative back benches who sympathized with them. She
succeeded, with one exception. Amery alone in the debate divined
instantly that she had decided to abandon the Muzorewa-Smith
government and, in a bitter and powerful speech, he castigated
her for so doing. It was to no avail."
-
March 30, 1997, The Independent,
'Courtiers down the centuries; Profile Robert Cranborne':
-
"After the Guards it was the City
and in 1970 he married, causing a family crisis because his
bride, Hannah Stirling (daughter [actually, niece] of the
founder of the SAS), was a Roman Catholic. The Cecils take the
defence of Protestantism and the Church of England seriously and
Robert's mother, Mollie, took time to be reconciled. A
compromise was reached and the two sons (the "heir and the
spare") were brought up as Anglicans, the three daughters as
Roman Catholics.
In 1978 domestic calm was shattered
when Lord Cranborne's brother Richard was killed by guerrillas
while filming in Rhodesia. The family were strong supporters of
the white settlers - the name of the country's capital,
Salisbury (after the 3rd Marquess), giving away the connection.
Robert went to Africa to try to find out how his brother died.
His brother's death seems only to have reinforced his public
support for the whites. During the 1980s he helped organise a
secret meeting between Ian Smith and Tory MPs, and backed
sporting links with apartheid South Africa."
When Robert was reporting on Rhodesia he
referred to the resistance as "terrorists" and reported every
gruesome detail of attacks and retaliations by the local black
resistance fighters, clearly showing his intent of upholding support
for White minority rule.

January 31, 1997, The Guardian, 'SAS
linked to rogue force in South Africa':
-
"The SAS has been linked to violence
by a 'third force' that threatened to undermine South Africa's
transition to majority rule, in a report considered so explosive
it was suppressed by Nelson Mandela... It confirms the
involvement of commando units in random violence, the use of
poison - supplied by the Seventh Medical Division - by hit
squads, and the supply of arms and training to the
Zulu-dominated Inkatha movement... The truth commission document
says evidence was given to Gen Steyn that destabilization of the
government and neighbouring countries was planned 'to enable the
military to step in credibly to create order'.
Preparations for this allegedly
involved stockpiling arms in countries which included Kenya,
Zambia, Mauritius and Portugal, to create 'springboards' for
possible military action. It said there was 'a suggestion that
there was close contact with the British SAS'... As reported by
the Guardian, a group of SAS officers working for a private
security firm in Britain [KAS] were hired by wealthy
conservationists in the late 1980s to come to South Africa to
fight elephant and rhinoceros poachers.
They became involved with local
intelligence agencies and reportedly took part in paramilitary
training. The British security firm, Kas Enterprises, was owned
by Sir David Stirling, the founder of the SAS, and taken over
after his death by Sir James Goldsmith. The security firm's SAS
mission to South Africa was headed by Ian Crooke, who led the
SAS..."

September 24, 1999, Kleintje Muurkrant,
-
'"People have been murdered under
the cover of nature protection" - Attorney severely criticises
the World Wide Fund for Nature' (translated from Dutch to
English): "It looks like the WWF to a large degree is
responsible for several projects, especially in South Africa,
where in two fases respectively one and a half million people
and subsequently ten thousand people were killed. In the first
phase it was about the battle in the frontline states against
the ANC [the major anti-apartheid movement], especially against
the military wing.
The war has been waged under the
cover of nature protection and while protecting nature these
people have lobbied the legislator to adopt a "shoot to kill"
policy, whereby it became legal to shoot poachers in the field
before arresting them. Afterwards you have to say that among the
victims were quite a lot of ANC members... After 1990 the
struggle shifted to the territory of South Africa [instead of
the whole of southern Africa]. During that time these people
trained a number of elite black units in the wildlife parks [of
the WWF], like the anti-cattle thieves brigade and the
crowbar-unit that turn out to responsible for the murder of
several ten thousand inhabitants of the townships.
This was part of the plan to create
a civil war between the Bantus and the Zulus, that is to say
that the ANC had to be set up against Inkatha [of Inkatha
Freedom Party, the second largest anti-apartheid movement which
mainly represented the Zulus] and that operation has been
conducted with the intention of destabilizing southern Africa."
