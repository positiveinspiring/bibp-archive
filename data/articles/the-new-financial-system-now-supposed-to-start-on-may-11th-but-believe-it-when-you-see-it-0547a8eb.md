A new dollar to replace the US dollar is going
to be introduced on May 11th, according to a senior CIA source.
Other
sources, including linked to the Chinese politburo, the Japanese secret
government and the British Royal family have all said something big and good
is imminent. However, we have seen so many deadlines come and go that we
shall continue to believe only what we see.
Fortunately, there is plenty out
there to show the
New World Order really is coming down.
The most important sign remains the criminal investigation of Goldman Sachs.
This is a frontal attack on Wall Street and the Feds. The wheels of justice
grind slowly but they grind to dust. The Europeans are now also considering
bringing criminal and civil charges against Goldman for helping Greece cook
its government books.
There is an awful lot I could say about Goldmans
activities in Japan too but, because of promises made to Japanese underworld
sources, I will keep my Japan Goldman file as insurance and not have it made
public unless I die.
In any case, this probe is not about Goldman Sachs so much as it is about
the entire Western banking system. The audit of
the Federal Reserve Board
that is now under way is now expected to go all the way back to 1916, when
the Federal Reserve Board first went into business (The act creating the Fed
was passed in 1913 but did not go into force until 1916).
As a sign of more to come, Deutschebank offices have been raided in Germany,
England and the Netherlands as part of a probe of fraudulent CO2 trading.
The corporate press and the blogosphere are now going into pack feeding
frenzy mode as it finally appears safe to target the previously taboo.
They
will not have to dig far before they uncover an awful lot of dirt.
In a sign of the increasing isolation of the Washington D.C. corporation,
the Europeans have been making many public statements in recent days about
the need to totally revamp the global financial system:
-
The head of the
European Central Bank told my former employer Forbes magazine of the need
for global financial governance
-
President Sarkozy of France was in China
promising to work together on global monetary reform
-
The President of
the European Commission was in Japan and China meeting with the Emperor and
Chinese leaders discussing the financial crisis
ECB President Favors Global Governance
Sarkozy and Hu bury hatchet in Beijing talks
Chinese President holds talks with European Commission President in Shanghai
We also confirmed, from our sources that reports
the British royalty have
asked the politicians in Washington to leave the 10 square British property
known as Washington D.C. are correct.
It is doubtful this order will be
obeyed but it is one more piece of evidence to show the increasing isolation
of the Federal Reserve Board crime syndicate.
There are also signs of military moves to fill the vacuum expected to be
created when the Pentagon begins to evacuate many of the 800 or so overseas
military bases it will soon not be able to pay for.
The biggest sign was the
Japanese self-defense forces creating Japans first overseas base since
World War 2. The base is being set up in Djibouti to protect shipping from
the Middle East.
The Russians also held giant naval exercises in the Sea of Japan in what
seems to be a signal to the Japanese that,
we both have an interest in
containing China.
Ever since
Obama went to China last year to propose the
US and China create a G2, the Japanese have begun to doubt if the US would
really go to war with China to save them.
That is why they are now probing
the possibility of allying themselves with India, Russia and other countries
that actually have borders with China.
The North Koreans also seem to be ratcheting up the pressure on South Korea
to come up with a peace agreement. Sorcha Faal, the US Naval Intelligence
information/disinformation site, claims it was the North Koreans who blew up
the oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.
Our source in China linked to the
politburo confirmed this, saying the new North Korean regime has decided to,
display its strength, bravery and determination.
Since North Korea and
South Korea are technically at war, North Korea is actually allowed to carry
out such acts of sabotage.
Other sources believe it was
the Bush/Nazi
faction that blew up the oil rig to spite the British and create distraction
from their troubles. However, since North Korea has worked closely with this
faction in the past, the two scenarios are not mutually contradictory.
There many similar signs of high-level preparations for change. For example,
last week the head of the UN and the Bank of Japan, among others, called for
the release and funding of green energy technology.
There are many actual
concrete new energy technology deals in the works that we are aware of but
will not yet write about in order to prevent sabotage.
Meanwhile, in Japan secret government sources continue to say the Prime
Minister Hatoyama will probably resign this month and be replaced by Finance
Minister Naoto Kan. I know Kan quite well and am quite sure he is not a
Federal Reserve Board puppet. However, it remains to be seen if he has what
it takes to reboot Japans financial system.
The Liberal Democratic Party that ruled Japan since the end of World War 2
is rapidly falling apart and efforts to create a new, viable right-leaning
party are proceeding rapidly. Japanese power brokers are planning to revamp
the political system sometime after the upper house elections due July 11th.
Their hope is to create a new dominant umbrella party containing various
factions much like the LDP did in its heyday.
No matter what though, the days of Japan being a Federal Reserve Board/New
World Order colony are coming to an end.
The various global power brokers this writer has talked to have said there
will not be any special announcements of a sudden change in how the world is
governed. Instead, they say it will take place in bits and pieces and is
exactly how events appear to be unfolding.
There can be no doubt to any but
the most brainwashed that historical changes are happening at an
accelerating rate.
