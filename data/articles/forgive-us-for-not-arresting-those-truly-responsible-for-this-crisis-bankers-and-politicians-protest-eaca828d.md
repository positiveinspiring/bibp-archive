Yesterday, in what is an appetizer to the
great 2013 convergence trade (that, between the now thoroughly dead
Greek and the Spanish economy, which is rapidly getting there, of course),
several thousand Spanish policemen took the streets of Madrid protesting the
latest round of austerity, which included frozen pensions and the
elimination of the Christmas bonus (they will have many more opportunities
to protest not only the loss of any future upside, but the eventual
cut of existing wages and entitlements).
As RT reports, protesters blew whistles, shouted
slogans, and carried anti-austerity banners as they marched through the city
centre to the interior ministry.
But perhaps the most telling message read on one
of the slogans, was the following:
"Citizens!
Forgive us for not arresting those truly responsible for this crisis:
bankers and politicians."
And there you have the entire current
clusterfuck summarized in one simple sentence:
because as long as those responsible for the
ongoing economic collapse, which will inevitably end in war as many have
observed, Kyle Bass most recently, are not only not arrested but
preserve their positions of power, any and all change will merely be
cosmetic and any real change will only affect the bank accounts of the
global middle class which are slowly but surely drained to zero.

from RT:
The Spanish government has imposed harsh
spending cuts aimed at saving 150 billion euros between 2012 and 2014.
The move has been met with anger and protests from hundreds of thousands
of Spanish citizens.
The austerity measures are in exchange for a
rescue loan of up to 100 billion euros from the EU to help the countrys
stricken banks.
"The problem is they take from us to
give to others, like the autonomous regions and the banks,"
33-year-old police officer Antonio Perez told AP.
But its not just their pay the police are
worried about.
A spokesman for Spains Unified Police
Union, Jose Maria Benito, said the cuts will affect the nations
security, adding that working conditions have become more precarious and
law enforcement equipment was no longer up to standard.
We are here to tell the government that
security has to be its priority
in socially convulsive times, we
need an adequate police response, Benito told AP. He added that
15,000 workers who have left the force were not going to be
replaced.
"Each year, between 1,500 and 2,000
police officers retire and 125 are recruited, which means in three
or four years, there will be more insecurity and crime in Spain,"
the unions general secretary Jose Maria Sanchez Fornet said in a
speech.
