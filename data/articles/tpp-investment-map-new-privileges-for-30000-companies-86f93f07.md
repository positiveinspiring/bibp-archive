Under previous presidential administrations, the
United States
signed a number of free trade agreements (FTAs) that grant foreign
corporations extraordinary rights and protections beyond the rights of
domestic companies.
A little-known FTA mechanism called
"investor-state" enforcement allows foreign firms to skirt domestic court
systems and directly sue governments for cash damages (our tax dollars) over
alleged violations of their new rights before
United
Nations and
World Bank tribunals
staffed by private sector attorneys who rotate between serving as "judges"
and bringing cases for corporations.
Using this extreme system, corporations have
sued the U.S.
government in foreign trade tribunals for enacting laws or regulations that
"interfered" with the
corporations' expected profits.
This "interference"
has included,
These cases are not just threats to domestic U.S. policies.
U.S. corporations have also used FTAs
to attack public
interest laws abroad.
If a corporation wins its private enforcement
case, the taxpayers of the "losing" country must foot the bill. Over
$380 million in compensation has already been paid out
to corporations
in a series of investor-state cases under U.S. FTAs.
Of the nearly $14 billion in the 18 pending
claims under U.S. FTAs, all relate to,
-
environmental
-
energy
-
public health
-
land use
-
transportation policies,
...not traditional trade issues.
The Obama administration is currently negotiating a sweeping new FTA called
the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
with,
Despite
Obama's many campaign promises to scale down investor-state enforcement
in trade agreements, the
leaked investment chapter of the TPP reveals that the Obama
administration intends to expand even further the extreme investor-state
model of past FTAs.
If passed, the TPP would grant thousands of corporations
these extraordinary rights to sue governments over public interest policies
for taxpayer compensation.
Below are the maps of the locations of
multinational corporations that would get these new rights if Congress would
pass the TPP.
More than 6,000 corporations with nearly 30,000
corporate affiliates would be able to use these rights, including over 300
financial services companies that could challenge essential financial sector
regulations through investor-state provisions.
These corporations could challenge the local
zoning and environmental laws of your community, so zoom in using the "+"

Friends of the

...and other organizations have called for a different trade agreement
model that protects the environment, workers' rights, and the public
interest.
This new model necessitates eliminating or
dramatically scaling down the "investor-state enforcement" provisions of
trade agreements which corporations can use to sue governments.

corporations operating in the TPP countries.

double clicking on the map to view the corporations located there.
Each country, with the exception of Brunei, has
hundreds of foreign corporate affiliates established in its territory that
would gain new rights under the investor-state dispute system of the TPP.
The table below summarizes the numbers for each
country.
This table indicates, for example, that 6,829
U.S. corporate affiliates are established in Australia, while 14,107
corporate affiliates from the other TPP countries are established in the
United States.
