An onrush of
condemnation and criticism kept the SOPA and PIPA acts from passing earlier this year, but US lawmakers have
already authored another authoritarian bill that could give them free reign
to creep the Web in the name of cybersecurity.
As congressmen in Washington consider how to handle the ongoing issue of
cyberattacks, some legislators have lent their support to a new act that, if
passed, would let the government pry into the personal correspondence of
anyone of their choosing.
H.R. 3523, a piece of legislation dubbed the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and
Protection Act (or
CISPA for short), has been created under the guise of
being a necessary implement in America's war against cyberattacks.
But the vague verbiage contained within the
pages of the paper could allow Congress to circumvent existing exemptions to
online privacy laws and essentially monitor, censor and stop any online
communication that it considers disruptive to the government or private
parties.
Critics have already come after CISPA for the
capabilities that it will give to seemingly any federal entity that claims
it is threatened by online interactions, but unlike the Stop Online Privacy
Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Acts (PIPA) that were discarded on the Capitol Building
floor after incredibly successful online campaigns to crush them, widespread
recognition of what the latest would-be law will do has yet to surface to
the same degree.
Kendall Burman of the Center for Democracy and Technology tells RT that
Congress is currently considering a number of cybersecurity bills that could
eventually be voted into law, but for the group that largely advocates an
open Internet, she warns that provisions within CISPA are reason to worry
over what the realities could be if it ends up on the desk of President
Barack Obama.
So far CISPA has been introduced, referred and
reported by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and expects
to go before a vote in the first half of Congress within the coming weeks.
"We have a number of concerns with something
like this bill that creates sort of a vast hole in the privacy law to
allow government to receive these kinds of information," explains Burman,
who acknowledges that the bill, as written, allows the US government to
involve itself into any online correspondence, current exemptions
notwithstanding, if it believes there is reason to suspect cyber crime.
As with other authoritarian attempts at
censorship that have come through Congress in recent times, of course, the
wording within the CISPA allows for the government to interpret the law in
such a number of degrees that any online communication or interaction could
be suspect and thus unknowingly monitored.
In a press release penned last month by the CDT, the group warned then that
CISPA allows Internet Service Providers to "funnel private communications
and related information back to the government without adequate privacy
protections and controls.
The bill does not specify which agencies ISPs could disclose customer data
to, but the structure and incentives in the bill raise a very real
possibility that the National Security Agency or the DOD's Cybercommand
would be the primary recipient," reads the warning.
The
Electronic Frontier Foundation, another online advocacy group, has also
sharply condemned CISPA for what it means for the future of the Internet.
"It effectively creates a 'cybersecurity''
exemption to all existing laws," explains the EFF, who add in a
statement of their own that "There are almost no restrictions on what
can be collected and how it can be used, provided a company can claim it
was motivated by 'cybersecurity purposes'."
What does that mean? Both the EFF and CDT say an
awfully lot.
Some of the biggest corporations in the country,
including service providers such as
Google,
Facebook, Twitter or AT&T, could
copy confidential information and send them off to the Pentagon if
pressured, as long as the government believes they have reason to suspect
wrongdoing.
In a summation of their own, the Congressional
Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of the Library of Congress, explains
that "efforts to degrade, disrupt or destroy" either "a system or network of
a government or private entity" is reason enough for Washington to reach in
and read any online communiqu√© of their choice.
The authors of CISPA say the bill has been made,
"To provide for the sharing of certain cyber
threat intelligence and cyber threat information between the
intelligence community and cybersecurity entities," but not before
noting that the legislation could be used "and for other purposes," as
well - which, of course, are not defined.
"Cyber security, when done
right and done narrowly, could benefit everyone," Burman tells RT.
"But it needs to be done in
an incremental way with an arrow approach, and the heavy hand that
lawmakers are taking with these current bills... it brings real serious
concerns."
So far CISPA has garnered support from over 100
representatives in the House who are favoring this cybersecurity legislation
without taking into considerations what it could do to the everyday user of
the Internet.
And while the backlash created by opponents of
SOPA and PIPA has not materialized to the same degree yet, Burman warns
Congress that it could be only a matter of time before concerned Americans
step up to have their say.
"One of the lessons we learned in the
reaction to SOPA and PIPA is that when Congress tries to legislate on
things that are going to affect Internet users' experience, the Internet
users are going to pay attention," says Burman.
H.R. 3523, she cautions,
"Definitely could affect in a
very serious way the internet experience."
Luckily, adds Burman,
"People are starting to
notice."
Given the speed that the latest censorship bill
could sneak through Congress, however, anyone concerned over the future of
the Internet should be on the lookout for CISPA as it continues to be
considered on Capitol Hill.
Fascism Comes to The Internet
Introducing CISPA

After nearly unprecedented pushback against bills SOPA and PIPA, their
apparent defeat cannot yet be claimed.
Most skeptics presumed that the
defeat of the aforementioned would only serve to offer a compromised "SOPA
light" at some point to circumvent criticism over government censorship.
Well, it didn't take long. In addition to OPEN and ACTA to combat supposed
piracy issues in the U.S. and Europe respectively, we now have been
presented with a full-on fascist template for Internet control where
government and private corporations will work hand in hand under the very
broad definition of cybersecurity.
The CISPA acronym is probably the most honest of those proposed thus far,
and certainly is self-explanatory: the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and
Protection Act.
Cybersecurity initiatives themselves are framed in such a
way as to declare the free and open Internet to be subsumed into national
security infrastructure, thus giving it over to the Pentagon, NSA, and other
agents for use in surveillance and even offensive war. However, CISPA goes
one step further to suggest that all information transmitted on this
national security infrastructure is fair game for the prying eyes of the
State.
Most likely the private sector must bow to any and all demands made,
or face being labeled as supporters of terrorism.
Both House and Senate are due to address CISPA (H.R. 3523) in the last weeks
of April - we had better make noise ten times louder than what was made
against previous attempts to hijack the Internet.
Once the Internet is
co-opted openly by the military-industrial-surveillance complex, there will
be very little chance for regaining what will be lost.
