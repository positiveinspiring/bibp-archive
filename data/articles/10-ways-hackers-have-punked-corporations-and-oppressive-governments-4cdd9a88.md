WikiLeaks and Julian Assange have
been much in the news lately, but hacktivism - the nontraditional use of
computing technology to advance political causes - has been around
for a long time.
Here we offer a primer on 10 of the most
significant hacktivist actions of all time.
1. Electronic
Disturbance Theater
In 1998, Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT) developed and utilized
a tool called
Floodnet to target,
-
the Pentagon
-
the White House
-
the School of the Americas
-
the office of Mexicos president
-
the Mexican Stock Exchange
-
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,
...all in support of the Zapatista guerrilla
movement in Mexico.
Floodnet, which has subsequently been released
as part of EDTs Disturbance Developer Kit, allowed users to participate
in a sit-in attack on these sites by a simple click on an icon on EDT's Web
site. The Floodnet software then directed the participating computers to
continually attack the target Web sites.
It has been estimated that 10,000 people
accessed Floodnet in this two-day action resulting in targeted servers being
hit at a rate of 600,000 hits per minute.
2. The Internet Black
Tigers (Sri Lanka)
An offshoot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil, the
Black Tigers showed that slick tools
like Floodnet werent necessary to carry out a denial of service attack.
The Tigers, protesting the Sri Lankan
government, organized email bombings (flooding servers with email) that
attacked the Sri Lankan consulates in Seoul and Ottowa, taking them offline.
The message flooding the servers was also quite
simple:
"We are the Internet Black Tigers and were
doing this to disrupt your communications."
3. Hong Kong Blondes
The
Hong Kong Blondes was an underground
network of Chinese students spread across at least three continents.
It was started by Blondie Wong, who had
reportedly witnessed his father being stoned to death during the 1966-'76
Cultural Revolution. Primarily protesting censorship and the violations of
human rights that occurred in China, the group launched cyberattacks against
the "Great Wall" - a series of firewalls put in place to block access to
Western Internet sites.
With members operating inside and outside of
China, the group claimed to have found significant security holes within
Chinese government computer networks and claimed to have defaced government
Web sites, torn down firewalls and even disabled Chinese communication
satellites.
They worked to forewarn political dissidents of
imminent arrests.
4. WANK Worm
According to Julian Assange, the
WANK worm is the first instance of
hacktivism. On Oct. 16, 1989, during the Cold War when nuclear war was an
immediate possibility, hackers hit the NASA computers with the WANK Worm.
Two days prior to the launch of the
plutonium-fueled Galileo space probe from the Kennedy Space Station, NASA
employees logged on to see a humorous yet frightening welcome screen:
"Your computer has been officially WANKed.
You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war," and
"Remember, even if you win the rat race, you're still a rat."
The machines of the U.S. Department of Energy
and NASA worldwide had been penetrated by the anti-nuclear WANK (WORMS
AGAINST NUCLEAR KILLERS) worm.
Once inside NASAs system, the WANK worm began to travel through the network
of interconnected computers, crawling through any holes in the security
system. While the worm attack did not stop the shuttle launch, the recovery
from the attack did require a massive expenditure of money and effort.
Because the worm avoided attacking the computers
in Australia and New Zealand and the worm source code showed specific
instructions to avoid infecting machines in New Zealand, it is suspected
that the attack originated from Australia.
Some have credited the Melbourne-based hackers,
Electron and Phoenix.
5. Net-strike Attack
Devised by the Strano Network
On December 21, 1995, a group called
Strano Network conducted what is
recognized as the first Internet sit-in.
The action targeted the Web sites of various
French government agencies to protest French nuclear and social policies. A
web sit-in occurs when the attackers generate a sufficient volume of traffic
to a Web site, preventing any legitimate traffic from accessing the site. In
this case participants from all over the world were instructed to point
their browsers toward designated sites and constantly reload the pages.
Because of the excessive traffic, the targeted
Web sites were made unavailable.
6. UrBaN Ka0s
On June 30th, 1997, the Portuguese hacking group
UrBaN Ka0s hacked and defaced the site
of the Department of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Indonesia and 25 other
military and government sites as part of the global protest against the
Indonesian government.
The goal was to support and bring attention to
the people of Timor, who had been oppressed and violated for decades by the
Indonesian government.
It is by most accounts the first large-scale
hacktivist action.
7. Toy Wars
In 1999 an online toy retailer called eToys filed suit against a group of
European artists for their use of the web address etoy.com - despite the
fact that the artists had been using that Web site for two years before
eToys.com came into existence.
Depressingly, but not surprisingly, the court
sided with the corporation, granting an injunction against etoy on Nov. 29
of that year. What eToys didnt count on was a group of hacktivists,
incensed by the injustice of the court decision, launching an internet
sit-in against eToys.com from Dec. 15-25, effectively clogging the Web site
during the Christmas shopping season.
What was interesting about the sit-in was that
it was structured as an online game in which the goal of players was the
devaluation of eToys stock. And indeed, eToys stock began to fall
immediately after the campaign started, and the company went out of business
within a short period of time.
Some commentators consider the sit-in to be a
significant contributing factor to the corporations collapse.
8. The Worlds
Fantabulous Defacers
In November 2000, one of the most prolific hacktivist goups of all time
emerged and operated for about two years, defacing, by some estimates, more
than 400 Web sites during its operation.
Called the Worlds Fantabulous Defacers,
its modus operandi was to deface institutional Web sites by inserting flash
videos and audio files that highlighted human rights violations against
Muslim populations (the goal being to raise global awareness - which
presumably explains why the defacements were in English).
Alexandra Samuel, then a PhD student,
interviewed two of the principle actors of WFD (M0r0n and nightman), and
learned that they had a fairly large portfolio of causes in the Muslim
world:
We have defaced FOR many issues, if you look at our defacements it says,
FREE KASHMIR, PALESTINE, LIFT THE SANCTIONS
ON IRAQ, FREE CHECHNIA.
So you see we are FOR all those people suffering
in the world against atrocities!
The WFD appeared to be based in Pakistan (that is certainly consistent with
their targets), and they ranged from an interuniversity library network in
India to the Web site of the Newspaper Association of America, a Chinese
computer company, and a commercial Web site advertising the Midwest Source
for Hip-Hop Info and Gear.
The group itself took its most important
defacements to be of the Bollywood Stock Exchange and Cricketbulls.com (a
site that trades imaginary shares in leading Indian cricket players).
The group supposedly ceased to be active in
2002, and there is some speculation that it was absorbed into some of the
larger Muslim hacktivist groups that continue to exist today.
9. PROJECT CHANOLOGY
Project Chanology (also called Operation
Chanology) was a protest movement against the practices of the Church of
Scientology by Anonymous, a loosely unorganized Internet-based group that
emerged from the 4chan message boards.
The project was started as a mental warfare
response to the
Church of Scientology's attempts to prevent
the online sharing of a video interview with actor/Scientologist Tom Cruise.
The project was publicly launched with a video (below) posted to YouTube, "Message
to Scientology," on January 21, 2008.
The project's goals were to,
"take down all Scientology Web sites as an
immediate act of retaliatory censorship, counteract Scientology's
attempts to suppress the videos (and other cult materials) by constantly
reposting them, and publicize the cult's well-documented history of
employing suppressive and violent tactics to mask its illegal or immoral
activities."
The initial cyber attack, which came in the form
of a distributed denial of service attack, was followed by black faxes,
prank calls, and other activities intended to disrupt the Church of
Scientology's operations.
10. Operation Payback
Is a Bitch
Anonymous has been back in action in recent weeks, with the launch of
Operation Payback Is a Bitch.
Operation Payback started because the
RIAA
(Recording Industry Association of America) and
MPAA (Motion Picture
Association of America) have been hiring law firms and programming companies
to take down Torrent sites (peer-to-peer computer networks used to share
movies and music and other digital media).
The stated goal of Operation Payback is to put
an end to what Anonymous perceives to be lobbyist-driven infringements of
personal freedom online. To counter these actions, Anonymous has launched an
elaborate cyberwar campaign against the entertainment companies and the
firms that were hired to hunt down and sue the alleged infringers.
In recent weeks, Anonymous has launched DDoS
attacks against the Web sites of RIAA, Aiplex, and ACS:Law, as well as
Gallant MacMillan and its client the Ministry of Sound. All these sites have
been taken down for several hours.
The real damage to
ACS:Law, however, came after the DDoS attack when, in
their haste to put everything in order, ACS:Law exposed the backup of their
confidential files containing confidential information. The emails of its
only lawyer, Andrew Crossley, in addition to thousands of personal records
that were handed over by Internet Service Providers (including Sky, BT and
Plusnet) in their hunt for alleged infringers appeared on the Web site,
unencrypted.
This in turn exposed the crass and humiliating
tactics the company used to extract money from alleged infringers through
out-of-court settlements.
The leaked documents also revealed that only
one-fifth of the money collected from damages paid was given to the rights
holders, meaning the law firm kept 80 percent of the money before paying
ISPs and IP tracking companies.
Over the past two decades hacktivism has expanded its set of methods and
also has been successfully used to target all centers of power, ranging from
governments and corporations, to religious institutions and well-funded
lobbying groups.
As a consequence, hacktivist methods and tools are now
used
fluently by tens of thousands of people around the world.
Current government obsession with
WikiLeaks is pointless; the jinni is out of
the bottle.
