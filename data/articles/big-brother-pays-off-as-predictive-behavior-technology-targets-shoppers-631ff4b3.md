Just prior to Black Friday, I
issued an alert that anyone shopping in either
of two American malls - Promenade Temecula in California, and Short Pump
Town Center in Richmond, Va. - would be tracked via their cell phone
utilizing
FootPath technology as they moved from store to store.
Fortunately, that test-run produced enough outrage to force both the UK
maker of the technology, Path Intelligence, as well as mall management to
halt the surveillance and respond to a call from Sen. Charles Schumer
over general privacy concerns, as well as the legality according to U.S.
regulations.
However, many retailers seem undeterred by privacy issues and have fully
embraced the concept of going even a step further:
forming a web comprised
of cell phone tracking, surveillance camera footage, and software analysis
of shoppers' movements and decisions.
A
recent report by Bloomberg comes to a disturbing conclusion in at least
one case - the greater the tracking, the greater the sales.
The concept of studying consumer behavior is certainly nothing new, but it
has advanced to nearly predictive behavior capability on the Internet. The
virtual world is naturally designed for databases and information analysis.
However, there is something just a bit more creepy and dehumanizing about
being studied in the physical world similar to mice being put through their
paces in a maze.
A little cheese here, a little shock there -
and, what do you know; look at 'em run.
I don't believe that's an inaccurate metaphor, as retailers are changing
their strategy from data collection through voluntary choice (customer
surveys) to the more compulsory covert surveillance and collection that
high-tech enables.
The result is an eye in the sky looking down
upon the maze of shoppers moving through different areas of stimulating
bait, while groups of gatekeepers encourage a pre-determined pattern of
behavior. The mission is to transform the unpredictable brick-and-mortar
world into the pattern recognition landscape of the Web.
Ashley Lutz and Matt Townsend, writing for Bloomberg, sum up the
programming:
The goal is to divine which variables affect
a purchase, then act with Web-like nimbleness to deploy more
salespeople, alter displays, or put out red blouses instead of blue.
RetailNEXT is a product of BVI Networks, which
is at the heart of the new high tech approach to shopper management.
Alexei Agratchev, chief executive officer of
consultancy, expressed his distaste for the unknown by saying that "stores
have been a black hole"... until now.
According to their website, the company utilizes
"best-in-class video analytics, on-shelf sensors and RFID readers along with
data from point-of-sale and other business systems" in order to create an
information field to fill that black hole.
Agratchev's background is interesting, having
formerly been a senior manager at Cisco systems and a consultant for
Accenture; a company currently at the center of government funding to
implement a
biometric database for illegal immigrants and U.S. citizens
alike, as well as construction of the Smart Grid.
All along we have repeatedly been reassured that security cameras and other
forms of surveillance were strictly to keep businesses and the public 'safe'
from criminals, but their ubiquitous presence has morphed into a tool to
track and catalog everyone, in both public and private sectors. Once again
the promise of more security brings only more enslavement.
Furthermore, the tech sector continues to be
exposed for having
built in backdoors from the very beginning at the behest
of government agencies like the FBI, calling into question any concern for
the true end user's
digital privacy rights.
And, true to form, the RetailNEXT technology of security camera and
RFID
tracking already seems to have been taken to the next level by security
systems' maker 3VR - they are incorporating facial recognition into the
shopping experience.
As company CEO, Al Shipp, boasts,
"Youll have the ability someday to measure
every metric imaginable. Were scratching the surface.
The shopping application is an extension of a
facial recognition security function that they have been using in
Northern
California banks where Shipp says,
We can search for a face in any of a banks
branches in Northern California in the last 30 days
3VR can do it in
about 30 seconds.
For a look at the extreme ends of where this
type of security camera/software integration is being developed, have a look
across the pond to Great Britain - which is, incidentally, where the makers
of the Black Friday mall tracking technology are based:
Shopper surveillance has already been embraced heavily in Europe, but so far
has been met with at least some resistance in the United States, as the
Black Friday mall tests have indicated.
Retailers like JCPenny have been hesitant to
sign on, as well as Home Depot.
However, when companies like Montblanc report a
20% sales increase since they began tracking their shoppers, other stores
are bound to overlook privacy issues. If people are so concerned, they might
reason, then why do they show up?
And this is the lesson we consumers should
learn:
If we don't want to be viewed as Pavlovian
maze dwellers, then let's believe more strongly in our human dignity. If
we are ready to give up our privacy so easily, then companies
specializing in data mining and behavior management certainly are ready
to take it.
To see where all of this is ultimately heading
unless we strongly resist and boycott the companies and locations that
install these technologies, please view the video below for

Big Brother Is Watching You Shop

On the Web, every click and jiggle of the mouse helps e-tailers customize
sites and maximize the likelihood of a purchase. Brick-and-mortar stores
have long wanted to track consumers in a similar fashion, but following
atoms is a lot harder than following bits.
For the most part, theyve been forced to rely
on consumer surveys, says Herb Sorensen, an adviser at market
research firm TNS Retail & Shopper (WPPGY) in London.
The problem with survey research is the
consumer can say one thing and do another.
To get a better understanding of their customers
in real time, mall operators are monitoring shoppers behavior with devices
that track mobile-phone signals, while retailers including,
...are finding new uses for old tools such as
in-store security cameras.
The goal is to divine which variables affect a
purchase, then act with Web-like nimbleness to deploy more salespeople,
alter displays, or put out red blouses instead of blue.
Until recently,
stores have been a black hole, says Alexei
Agratchev, chief executive officer of consultancy RetailNext. People
were convinced something was true and spending tens of millions based on
that without evidence to back it up.
Agratchev says RetailNext was founded in 2007 to
change that.
It helps retailers build systems to better
understand customer behavior. In most cases, the company relies on the video
from a stores existing security camera system. That feed is run through
RetailNexts software, which analyzes the video and correlates it with sales
data. The software can also integrate data from hardware such as
radio-frequency identification (RFID)
chips and motion sensors to track how often a brand of cereal is
picked up or how many customers turn left when they enter a store.
The company now has 40 retailer clients,
including American Apparel (APP) and Family Dollar, and another 20 are
testing the systems.
RetailNexts data sometimes refutes conventional
wisdom. For instance, many food manufacturers pay a premium for their
products to be displayed at the end of an aisle. But customers pay greater
attention to products placed in the center of an aisle, according to
RetailNexts analysis.
Luxury retailer Montblanc began testing RetailNexts video analytics at a
store in Miami six months ago. Employees have used it to generate maps
showing which parts of the store are best-trafficked and to decide where to
place in-store decorations, salespeople, and merchandise.
Rodrigo Fajardo, Montblancs brand
manager in Miami, says RetailNexts analysis helps his team make decisions
faster.
We arent taking six months to make a
change, he says. We analyze one week, and the next week we are making
the changes.
He says the software has helped boost sales 20
percent and that Montblanc plans to expand its use to a dozen locations.
T-Mobile employs similar technology from San Franciscos
3VR, a
maker of security systems. Two years ago, 3VR executives realized
that its cameras could be used to gather consumer data, according to the
companys CEO, Al Shipp.
He says T-Mobile, in Bellevue, Wash., uses 3VRs
technology in some of its retail stores to track how people move around, how
long they stand in front of displays, and which phones they pick up and for
how long. T-Mobile declined to comment. Now 3VR is testing
facial-recognition software that can identify shoppers gender and
approximate age.
The software would give retailers a better
handle on customer demographics and help them tailor promotions, Shipp says.
Youll have the ability someday to measure
every metric imaginable. Were scratching the surface.
Some retailers are installing gear to track
shoppers via cell phones.
Path Intelligence, a company in Portsmouth,
England, started selling a technology in 2009 that records a phones
cellular signal and follows its owner through a building. Today its used
primarily by malls in Europe, and the company says its technology records
the paths of more than 1 million customers every day.
Some retailers use the data to figure out where
in a mall to place their stores, says Path Intelligence CEO Sharon Biggar.
Others use it to find out the nationality of their visitors using the
country code at the start of their phone numbers.
Shopping centers using FootPath post signs near entrances and mall maps
informing shoppers that their mobile phones are being tracked and to turn
off their phones if they dont want to be monitored. But such tracking still
concerns privacy advocates.
David Jacobs, a fellow at the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, says its impractical to
suggest shoppers turn off their phones because so many people use them to
meet up with friends.
Path Intelligence says it doesnt record
anyones identity and alters some of the digits in each phone number before
storing it.
We have designed this service so that its
impossible to detect any personal information or link the number to a
person, says Biggar.
Not everyone is reassured.
In November the Short Pump Town Center in
Richmond, Va., and the Promenade Temecula mall in California began testing
Footpath, the first such trials in the U.S.
The test was suspended after one day following
complaints from Senator Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) that the
technology could compromise shoppers privacy.
We would like to address the privacy
concerns before moving forward, says Julia Yuryev, a spokeswoman for
Forest City Commercial Management (FCE/A), which owns both shopping
centers.
J.C. Penney (JCP) tested the technology in one
store but has no plans to implement it, says Rebecca Winter, a
spokeswoman for the chain.
The more focused you get on the shopper,
the greater their risks, says Jacobs.
Mark Rasch, director of cybersecurity and
privacy at CSC (CSC), a consulting firm in Falls Church, Va., says that
tracking phones or using cameras to glean shopping habits is no more
intrusive than what online retailers do.
These tools are likely to become more common if
other retailers can replicate Montblancs success at boosting sales.
Its really a game-changing experience, and
this is only the beginning, says brand manager Fajardo. Before we were
just working based on certain know-how and intuition. This is designing
a retail business based on real statistics.
The bottom line: Montblanc reports sales
increases of 20 percent with shopper-tracking technology that raises privacy
concerns.
