Militarized police
Totalitarian governments, like persistent forms
of cancer, have latched onto the long history of man, falling and then
reemerging from the deep recesses of our cultural biology to wreak havoc
upon one unlucky generation to the next.
The assumption by most is that these unfortunate
empires are the product of bureaucracies gone awry; overtaken by the chaotic
maddening hunger for wealth and power, and usually manipulated by the
singular ambitions of a mesmerizing dictator.
For those of us in
the Liberty
Movement who are actually educated on the less acknowledged details of
history, oligarchy and globalized centralism is much less random than this,
and a far more deliberate and devious process than the general unaware
public is willing consider.
Unfortunately, the final truth is very complex, even for us
One cannot place the blame of despotism entirely on the shoulders of
globalists. Sadly, the crimes of elites are only possible with a certain
amount of complicity from subsections of the populace. Without our penchant
for apathy and fear, there can be no control.
That is to say, there is no
power over us but that which we give away. We pave the road to our own
catastrophes.
In the end, a tyrants primary job is not to crush the masses and rule out
of malevolence, but to obtain the voluntary consent of the citizenry,
usually through trickery and deceit. Without the permission of the people,
subconscious or otherwise, no tyranny can survive.
As with the oppressive regimes of the past, America has undergone a dramatic
transformation, heavy with fear and ignorance.
-
Our tradition of elections
has been corrupted and negated by the false left/right paradigm, and the
leaderships of both defunct parties now seek only to elevate a select
minority of men bent on globalization.
-
Our Constitutional liberties have
been dismantled by legal chicanery.
-
Our principles have been diluted by
intellectual games of rationalism and moral relativism.
-
Our country is ripe
for conquest.
Americans battle over whose side is most to blame; Democrat or Republican,
while ironically being disenchanted with both entities.
For some people, the
thought of holding each party equally accountable, or accepting that they
are essentially the same animal, never crosses their minds.
While this irrelevant farce of a debate rages on, the true culprits plotting
the demise of our Republic gain momentum, and implement policy initiatives
that the public should and must take note of. In the past year alone, many
blatant steps towards the Orwellian gulag have been openly administered.
A
carnival of peddlers and freaks and greasy popcorn overwhelms our senses,
but the stench of this cheap circus still tickles our noses, and if we use
our eyes for even a moment, certain dangerous trends reveal themselves.
Here are just a few recent events that bear a
dire warning; the ultimate assault on freedom in this nation grows near
Acclimation To
Subservience
Every totalitarian state worth its salt has its own goon squad.
The Nazis
had the Brownshirts, the Soviets had the Militsiya and the Voluntary
Peoples Brigade, the Communist Chinese have the Chengguan, etc. In
America, however, all tyrannical measures are given innocuous bureaucratic
labels to mislead and distract the masses.
In this country, we have the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA)
The TSA has become the most hated alphabet agency in the U.S. in perhaps the
fastest time on record. It has violated the personal rights of more people
on a daily basis in my view than the IRS, DEA, and the ATF combined.
Clearly, this slobbering demon child of the Department of Homeland Security
is being molded for something quite terrible and grand.
When confronted by the public on the use of irradiating and intrusive naked
body scanner technology, the agency responded by allowing their blue handed
ghoul army with to molest our nether-regions. When confronted by state and
local governments on their absurd tactics, the TSA threatened economic
blockades and airport shutdowns.
The organization then began expanding its
jurisdiction to bus and train stations and even our highways when it
introduced the VIPR program and implemented random roadside checkpoints in
Tennessee last year. But, this behavior is nothing compared to what is next
on the horizon: a compromise
Beware of government agencies bearing gifts. The TSA along with the
International Air Transport Association has announced a new methodology of
less intrusive passenger screening measures, in order to address the
concerns of the public over pat downs and irradiating naked body scanners.
This SOUNDS like a step in the right direction, and a proper response to the
grievances of the citizenry. Instead, it turns out to be a refined example
of totalitarianism in motion, and a perfect lesson in how the masses can be
duped into handing over their inherent freedoms.
Revamped security protocols call for biometric data collection, including
fingerprint and retina scans, and a tunnel which
combines multiple detection systems into
one area (who knows how radioactive this will end up being).
The mainstream article above makes this development sound like a win/win
scenario for everyone, painting biometric data collection as a matter of
convenience, but it also reveals the true design of the system; to illicit
voluntary subservience:
The key to speeding up checkpoints and making security less intrusive will
be to identify and assess travelers according to the risks they pose to
safety in the skies.
The so-called riskiest or unknown passengers would face
the toughest scrutiny, including questioning and more sensitive electronic
screening. Those who voluntarily provide more information about themselves
to the government would be rewarded with faster passage
They enforce destructive anti-personal rights policies then pretend to
acquiesce by replacing them with a technocratic nightmare grid which
requires the cataloging of our very genetic essence in order to function.
The only remaining injustice left would be to apply this grid to the rest of
the country outside of the airports and train stations, which I assure you,
they plan to do.
Militarization
Last week, I covered the disturbing use of armored vehicles (APCs or urban
tanks) in open training regiments on the streets of St. Louis by the U.S
Army, despite the fact that all of their exercises could have easily been
accomplished on any number of military bases across the country.
The action is an obvious attempt to condition
the American populace to the sight of
military units operating in a policing capacity.
I received multiple letters from current serving military who stated that in
all their years in the armed forces they had never seen such a brash
mishandling of public relations or an overstepping of bounds when it came to
the restrictions of
Posse Comitatus.
It was encouraging to hear from
military men and women who did not agree with or condone this kind of psyop
activity on the part of our government.
Though the St. Louis event is not isolated, I believe it does represent an
escalation.
Remember the controversy over the
Mayor of Toledo and his refusal to allow
200 Marines to conduct urban combat drills on the public streets
of his city in 2008? The media clamored to crucify this public official; one
of the few who had any sense whatsoever in his head.
Or the 'tactical exercises'
using helicopters and combat troops over LA and
Chicago early this year?
During each one of these events, city officials and local media attempted to
inoculate the public with claims that they were simply exercises. This
argument misses the point entirely.
Whether or not these are exercises is
not the issue. The issue is that this training could be done ON BASE.
Using
public streets and running drills within cities is absolutely unnecessary
given the vast resources already available to the military, unless, of
course, the goal is to BE SEEN by the public and to influence them to view
the sight of armed troops around them as normal.
Add to this the fact that many of these military training exercises are
being conducted in tandem with local police department, and you have a
recipe for the utter militarization of our society, turning peace officers
into combat soldiers, and combat soldiers into law enforcement mechanisms; a
juxtaposition that will soon lead to unmitigated disaster.
Arms Race Against the
People?
When a country is quietly preparing for war, the first signs are usually
revealed by a disclosure of armaments.
If stockpiling is taking place
without a warranted threat present from a legitimate enemy, there is a
considerable likelihood of aggression on the part of that nation. America
has gone well beyond the psychological process of militarization and has
begun the extensive arming of particular agencies whose primary purpose
revolves around the domestic.
The DHS, for instance, placed an order for
over 450 million rounds of hollow-point .40 cal ammunition in April of this year:
And it
placed an order for over 7000 new
semi-automatic combat rifles chambered in .223 (5.56 by 45mm NATO)
immediately after.
While local police through federal programs (like
the 1033 Program) are
being given
millions of dollars in free military equipment, including body
armor, night vision equipment, APC's, aircraft, first aid supplies, weapons,
surveillance equipment, Kevlar helmets, gas masks and filters, vehicles,
etc.
All of this equipment, though issued to state agencies, is still heavily
tracked and
regulated by the federal government, making
it clear that these gifts come with strings attached.
And finally, new FAA regulations will soon allow the dispersion of tens of
thousands of predator drones with armament capability in the skies of the
U.S. over the course of the next few years (also
here.)
Now, anyone with any logic would ask who it is that the government is arming
itself and local police to fight against? Al Qaeda? Lets not be naïve
The passage of the NDAA and its provisions for the indefinite detainment of
ANY person, even an American citizen, under the laws of war has ended the
debate over government intent in terms of domestic action.
FBI Director
Robert Muellers admission that he did not know if assassination programs
would be used against American citizens also heaped evidence on the matter.
The bottom line? Our government wishes to label and treat citizens as enemy
combatants.
Of course they would then organize armaments to follow through
on their policy.
Pulling The Trigger
All despotic systems have another distinct similarity; they each began with
a series of trigger events which opened the door to tighter controls over
the population.
The most immediate trigger event for the U.S. is the looming
peril of a collapsing economy followed by inevitable civil unrest. With the
EU currently in debt shambles, global markets are on the verge of a
considerable breakdown.
The Federal Reserve response will be predictable;
QE3 and massive stimulus all around to mitigate the crisis.
This time,
though, the go-to Keynesian quick fix will not work in the slightest. In
fact, it will make matters more untenable by placing the world reserve
status of the dollar at risk.
Everything that has happened so far in the markets this year has been easy
to foresee. Alt-Market predicted the economic slowdown around the world and
the collapse of overall demand using
the Baltic Dry Index as a gauge back in
January.
We also predicted the accelerated turmoil in the EU
in light of the recent
election results in France and Greece.
If alternative economic analysts can predict these developments despite the
manipulated statistics spewed out by the government every month, then I
think the government and our central bank has a tremendously transparent
view of what is coming down the road in terms of financial distress.
I
believe the establishment is very well aware of a potential crisis event,
economic or otherwise, that is barreling down upon the U.S.
I believe the
evidence shows that they are preparing for this eventuality in a command and
control fashion, without alerting the public to the coming implosion. I
believe they will use the despair that flows forth from the fiscal wreckage
as an excuse to institute martial law.
Call it "crazy". Call it conspiracy theory. Call it coincidence. Call it
"fear mongering". Whatever you like...
I find it far more insane to shrug off
the strange and twisted behavior of our power structure, and simply hope
that its all irrelevant to the future.
Whenever I run into starry eyed
historical romanticists who look back in astonishment at the tyrannies of
the past and wonder out loud,
How could those people have not known where
their country was headed?!!, I think of where we are today
