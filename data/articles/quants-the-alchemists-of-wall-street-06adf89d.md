Quants are the math wizards and computer programmers in the engine room of
our global financial system who designed the financial products that almost
crashed Wall St.
The credit crunch has shown how the global
financial system has become increasingly dependent on mathematical models
trying to quantify human (economic) behavior.
Now the Quants are at the heart of yet another
technological revolution in finance:
trading at the speed of light.

A story about greed, fear and randomness from the insides of
Wall Street.
