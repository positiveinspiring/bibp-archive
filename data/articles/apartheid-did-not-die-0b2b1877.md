Apartheid based on race is outlawed now, but the system always went far
deeper than that.
The cruelty and injustice were underwritten by an economic apartheid, which
regarded people as no more than cheap expendable labor.
It was backed by
great business corporations in,
-
South Africa
-
Britain
-
the rest of Europe
-
the United States
And it was this apartheid based on money and profit to allow a small
minority to control most of the land, most of the industrial wealth, and
most of the economic power.
Today, the same system is called - without a
trace of irony - the 'free market.'
John Pilger was banned from South Africa for his reporting during the
apartheid era.
On his return thirty years later with Alan Lowery, he
describes the extraordinary generosity of a liberated people, but asks who
are the true beneficiaries of a democracy - the black majority or the white
minority?
