Naval Investigative Service
Naval operations are a threat to civilians. If you read the second
edition of True Democracy (La verdad sobre la democracia) you would
have read about the Colombian fishermen in the Pacific Ocean; you would realize
that the U. S. Navy was breaking international law. Any agency which does
this action, does not deserve to exist.
No one threatens Naval operations. They are a threat to those with whom
they come in contact. In addition to the Colombian fishermen, the U.S. Navy
has broken the law since 1941 when they invaded Vieques, Puerto Rico. They
are not appreciated there therefore, they are not welcomed there.
The Naval Investigative Service need not exist.
