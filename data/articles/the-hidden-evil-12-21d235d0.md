Wall Street funded Nazis
Professor Antony Sutton in his book, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,
Professor Antony Sutton (pictured right), author of nineteen books, provides
a thoroughly documented account of the role played by Morgan, Rockefeller,
General Electric Company, Standard Oil, National City Bank, Chase and
Manhattan banks, Kuhn, Loeb and Company, General Motors, Ford, and other
industrialists, in helping to finance the Nazis.
To prove his point, Professor Sutton provides
bank statements, letters from U.S. ambassadors, mainstream media sources,
Congressional Records, excerpts from Congressional Investigations, and
statements from the Nuremberg trials. Wall Street's funding of the Nazis is
part of authentic history.
Professor Sutton wrote that,
"General Motors, Ford, General Electric,
DuPont," and other "U.S. companies intimately involved with the
development of Nazi Germany were... controlled by the Wall Street
elite," such as "the J.P. Morgan firm, the Rockefeller Chase Bank and to
a lesser extent the Warburg Manhattan bank."
"The deal bringing Hitler into the government was cut at the home of
banker Baron Kurt von Schroeder on January 4, 1933," wrote author Marrs.
Other notable figures that are said to have
appeared at this meeting include Council on Foreign Relations members John
Foster Dulles, and Allen Dulles, of the New York law firm Sullivan and
Cromwell, which represented the Schroeder bank.
Allen Dulles would eventually become a member
the Bilderbergers and director of the CIA.
Zyklon B"Max Warburg," stated Marrs, "a
major German banker, and his brother Paul Warburg, who had been
instrumental in establishing the Federal Reserve System in the United
States, were directors of Interssen Gemeinschaft Farben or I.G. Farben,
the giant German chemical firm that produced Zyklon B gas used in Nazi
extermination camps."
On the left we see used canisters of the Zyklon
B gas found by the allies after WWII.
The gas was apparently produced with the full
support of American industrialists.
"The financing for Adolph Hitler's rise to
power was handled through the Warburg-controlled Mendelsohn Bank of
Amsterdam and later by the J. Henry Schroeder Bank with branches in
Frankfurt, London and New York," wrote Gary Allen. "Chief legal council
to the J. Henry Schroeder Bank was the firm Sullivan and Cromwell whose
senior partners included John Foster and Allen Dulles."
Author James Perloff concurs, and reveals the
role that the Council on Foreign Relations played in aiding the Nazis.
He states,
"In 1939, on the eve of blitzkrieg, the
Rockefellers' Standard Oil of New Jersey sold $20 million in aviation
fuel to... I.G. Farben [and] even had an American subsidiary called
American I.G." Describing the CFR's connection to the Nazis, he lists
the directors of the American I.G. as "ubiquitous Paul Warburg (CFR
founder), Henry A. Metz (CFR founder), and Charles E. Mitchell, who
joined the CFR in 1923..."
Other U.S. companies which contributed heavily
to the Nazi war machine include Brown Brothers Harriman (BBH) and Union
Banking Corporation (UBC), both of New York.
Prescott Bush (grandfather of President George
W. Bush) was a partner at BBH and director of UBC. UBC of New York, which
was founded and chaired by E. Roland Harriman, is now confirmed to have been
a Nazi front company.
In a story called, Bush-Nazi Link Confirmed, on October 10, 2003, The New
Hampshire Daily Gazette announced,
"After 60 years of inattention and even
denial by the U.S. media, newly-uncovered government documents in The
National Archives and Library of Congress reveal that Prescott Bush...
served as a business partner... for the financial architect of the Nazi
war machine from 1926 until 1942."
A similar article appeared in the London
Guardian on September 25, 2004, it was entitled,
How Bush's Grandfather
Helped Hitler's Rise to Power.
"Prescott Sheldon Bush... father of the
[former] President George [H. W.] Bush... was a partner in the Wall
Street firm of Brown Brothers Harriman for 40 years," wrote Professor
Marrs.
"It was Brown Brothers Harriman that helped
to finance... the 1917 communist revolution in Moscow and the rise of
Hitler and Nazism, through money made possible by it and the affiliated
Guaranty Trust Company."
Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands who served in
an intelligence unit for the German branch of Farben was also a member of
the Nazi SS. Bernhard eventually became a founding member of the
Bilderbergers.
Death ChamberIn his book, The Rockefeller File, Gary Allen wrote,
"The alliance between Nazi Germany and the
Rockefellers is truly shocking."
He explained,
"Hitler's Luftwaffe ran on Standard petrol,
and the Rockefellers were partners in I.G. Farben Industries, whose
thousands of war products included the poison gas used in Nazi death
camps."
Professor Sutton added,
"American I.G. Farben, General Electric,
Standard Oil of New Jersey, Ford, and other U.S. firms" were "directly
responsible for bringing the Nazis to power."
The Russian soldier on the right is standing on
top of a death chamber, near the opening from which the gas was dropped.
"German bankers on the Farben Aufsichsrat
(the supervisory Board of Directors) [of I.G. Farben] in the late 1920s
included the Hamburg banker Max Warburg, whose brother Paul Warburg was
a founder of the Federal Reserve System in the Unite States," revealed
Professor Sutton.
"Not coincidentally, Paul Warburg was also
on the board of American I.G., Farben's wholly owned U.S. Subsidiary."
So what this means is that Paul Warburg aided
the Nazis while working for I.G. Farben in the U.S., while his brother
helped them while working for the same company in Germany.
"The two largest tank producers in Hitler's
Germany were Opel, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors
(controlled by the J.P. Morgan firm), and the Ford A.G. subsidiary of
the Ford Motor Company of Detroit," wrote Professor Sutton.
"In brief," he affirmed, "American companies
associated with the Morgan-Rockefeller international investment
bankers... were intimately related to the growth of Nazi Industry."
HollerithOn March, 29, 2002, The Guardian ran an
article entitled, IBM Dealt Directly with Holocaust Organisers.
They wrote that,
"Newly discovered documents from Hitler's
Germany prove that the computer company IBM directly supplied the Nazis
with technology which was used to help transport millions of people to
their deaths in the concentration camps at Auschwitz and Treblinka."
According to this mainstream publication, IBM
supplied the Hollerith machines (pictured right) that determined when people
would die, according to their weight, height, age, and other attributes.
Hitler & Watson Meeting
Similarly, an article entitled, How IBM Helped
Automate the Nazi Death Machine in Poland, appeared in The Village Voice on
March 27, 2002, alleging that there was,
"a strategic business alliance between IBM
and the Reich, beginning in the first days of the Hitler regime and
continuing right through World War II."
It continued,
"Recently discovered Nazi documents... make
clear that IBM's alliance with the Third Reich went far beyond its
German subsidiary. A key factor in the Holocaust in Poland was IBM
technology provided directly through... IBM New York, mainly to its
headquarters at 590 Madison Avenue."
Pictured above is a 1937 meeting between Adolph
Hitler (left), and the head of IBM, Thomas J. Watson (center).
One excuse used by the industrialists that supported the Nazis, is that they
had no idea what was going on. Unveiling this falsehood, Professor Sutton
explained,
"This financial and technical assistance is
referred to as 'accidental' or due to the 'short-sightedness' of
American businessmen."
However, he stated,
"the evidence presented... strongly suggests
some degree of premeditation on the part of these American financiers."
He further noted,
"The general impression left with the reader
by modern historians is that this American technical assistance was
accidental and that American industrialists were innocent of
wrongdoings."
Stukas
The Kilgore Committee under the United States
Senate charged with post World War II investigations concluded that,
"the United States accidentally played an
important role in the technical arming of Germany... Germans were
brought to Detroit [Ford Motor Company] to learn the techniques of
specialized production of components, and of straight-line assembly...
The techniques learned in Detroit were eventually used to construct the
dive-bombing Stukas."
To the right we see the German Stukas used
during WWII, which were apparently designed with the help of Ford Motor
Company.
Reportedly, the planes ran on fuel supplied by
Rockefeller. The report continued,
"At a later period I.G. Farben
representatives in this country enabled a stream of German engineers to
visit not only plane plants but others of military importance, in which
they learned a great deal that was eventually used against the United
States."
Professor Sutton points out,
"[The Kilgore Committee] makes it clear that
I.G. Farben directors had precise knowledge of the Nazi concentration
camps and the use of I.G. chemicals."
To illustrate his point, he quotes a 1945
interrogation of I.G. Farben director von Schnitzler in which Schnitzler
stated,
"I was horrified" that the chemicals were
being used in the camps but "kept it to myself because it was too
terrible."
Professor Sutton suggests,
"not only was an influential sector of
American business aware of the nature of Naziism, but for its own
purposes aided Naziism wherever possible" and "profitable."
He charges,
"The pleas of innocence do not accord with
the facts."
James Stewart Martin investigated the structure
of the Nazi industry while working as Chief of the Economic Warfare Section
for the Department of Justice.
In his book, All Honorable Men, published in
1950, he asserts that American and British businessmen got themselves
appointed to key positions in the post-war investigation. Martin concludes
that this was a deliberate tactic to divert, stifle and muffle investigation
of Nazi industrialists and to hide their own involvement.
Regarding this matter Professor Sutton observed,
"The evidence suggests there was a concerted
effort not only to protect Nazi businessmen, but also to protect the
collaborating elements of American and British business."
Referring to the Kilgore Committee in 1946,
Professor Sutton wrote,
"Accordingly, it is not at all difficult to
visualize why Nazi industrialists were puzzled by 'investigations' and
assumed at the end of the war that their Wall Street friends would bail
them out and protect them from the wrath of those who had suffered."
Apparently these Nazis were angry that they were
even on trial and boasted that their "friends" in Wall Street would rescue
them.
The Kilgore Committee in 1946 described the attitudes of these Nazi war
criminals stating,
"Their general attitude and expectation was
that the war was over and we ought now to be assisting them in helping
to get I.G. Farben and German industry back on its feet. Some of them
have outwardly said that this questioning and investigation was... of
short duration, because as soon as things got a little settled they
would expect their friends in the Untitled States and England to be
coming over. Their friends, so they said, would put a stop to activities
such as these investigations..."
The Control Council which was given the task of
preparing directives for the arrest and detention of war criminals, moved
into Germany after the war. It was headed by the Council on Foreign
Relations.
Professor Sutton observed,
"At the end of World War II, Wall Street
moved into Germany through the Control Council to protect their old
cartel friends and limit the extent to which the denazification fervor
would damage old business relationships."
He said,
"General Lucius Clay, the deputy military
governor for Germany, appointed... Banker William Draper [to]... put his
control team together from businessmen who had represented American
business in pre-war Germany."
The CFR/Wall Street managed these investigations
from the top.
"So when we examine the Control Council for
Germany," wrote Professor Sutton "we find that the head of the finance
division was Louis Douglas, director of the Morgan-controlled General
Motors," and the head of the "Economics Division was William Draper, a
partner in the Dillon, Read Firm that had so much to do with building
Nazi Germany in the first place."
"All three men [Douglas, Clay, and Draper]
were, not surprisingly... members of the Council on Foreign Relations,"
he added.
"None of the Americans were ever prosecuted," wrote Perloff.
"The story of American ties to German
fascism has been avoided like the plaque by the major U.S. media."
Professor Sutton declared,
"After World War II the Tribunals set up to
investigate Nazi war criminals were careful to censor any materials
regarding Western assistance to Hitler."
"[At] the very core of Naziism," says Professor Sutton, we "find Wall
Street, including Standard Oil of New Jersey and I.T.T., represented...
[up] to as late as 1944."
Referring to Wall Street's role in funding the
Nazis as being one part of a consolidation plan for world domination, he
concludes,
"This interplay of ideas and cooperation...
was only one facet of a vast and ambitious system of cooperation and
international alliance for world control."
The professor quotes an Establishment insider;
Georgetown professor Dr. Carroll Quigley, as saying that it was,
"nothing less than to create a world system
of financial control, in private hands, able to dominate the political
system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole."
Summary
According to this information, the Council on Foreign Relation, played an
important role in funding the Nazis, and orchestrated the investigations to
prevent their connections from being made public. This is a major historical
lie.
This evidence also suggests that Wall Street/CFR
not only funded, but arguably, created the Nazi war machine.
