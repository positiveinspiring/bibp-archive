Who's Targeted?
As I've already demonstrated, the people controlling the United States and
other developed countries are not good people.
Once you understand how these controlling elite
operate, it's easy to see why they are deliberately targeting innocent
people. On September 12, 2006, the Associated Press published, Official
Touts Nonlethal Weapons for Use, where they announced, "Air Force official
says nonlethal weapons should be used on people in crowd-control
situations."
They continued, "Nonlethal weapons such as high-power microwave devices
should be used on American citizens... the Air Force secretary said
Tuesday... Domestic use would make it easier to avoid questions in the
international community over any possible safety concerns, said Secretary
Michael Wynne." Wynne stated, "If we're not willing to use it here against
our fellow citizens, then we should not be willing to use it in a wartime
situation."
In the June/July 1987 issue of Peace Magazine, under an article entitled,
Zapping the Movement, Congressman James Scheur is quoted as saying,
"We are developing devices and products
capable of controlling violent individuals, and entire mobs without
injury... We can tranquilize, impede, immobilize, harass, shock, upset,
chill, temporarily blind, deafen, or just plain scare the wits out of
anyone the police have a proper need to control and restrain."(*)
The military and a member of congress have now
openly declared that these weapons should be used on civilians.
The Sun Journal ran an article on September 28, 1992, entitled, Woman Fears
Government Zapping, where they described a 72 year-old woman that had been
harassed in multiple states and countries, allegedly by the FBI and CIA. She
visited various doctors in Richmond, VA, who told her that nothing was
wrong. The harassment continued when she visited doctors in England, Sweden,
Finland, and Canada.
"Electronic government weapons are zapping burns in her face... and emit
rays that stab her back and make her brain feel swollen," they wrote. "She
says she gets zapped in her home, her car and even in church on Sunday
mornings... She does not know why she is a target." They continued, "[She]
says she is sure the powers that are tormenting her are evil... [and
doesn't] know why they are after her." "Our government now is controlled,"
she said, and added, "I think the CIA, the FBI and the military are evil."
If you're targeted, no one will tell you so. Some people conclude they were
harassed for years before they realized what was happening. Multiple people
within a family can be targeted, which indicates a pattern suggesting that
these harassment campaigns are intergenerational. Many people don't know why
they're targeted or exactly when it began. "No TI should look for a reason
why this is going on," warned McKinney. "It's a serious, serious mistake."
As a result of surveillance, the people overseeing these harassment squads
know this is nothing about monitoring a threat to national security, and
everything to do with the deliberate misuse of resources for no good reason.
When you see the words, "threat to national security," think "threat to
corporate control." McKinney's analysis leads her to conclude that most of
those targeted are not and never have been a threat. Moret describes this
program as an "absolutely terrible secret policy," and warns, "Americans
need to understand that they are the primary targets of this war on terror."
This is the elite's way of removing people from society that they dislike or
see as a nuisance. Once you research this, and find out what they've done,
how they've repeatedly lied, and what their intentions are, then this
accusation doesn't seem outlandish, but makes perfect sense. McKinney hinted
that the reasons of national security blanket might be the justification for
these harassment campaigns, and spoke of the "absence of clear definitions"
of terms such as "national security" and "national security risk."
Similarly, in East Germany and Russia, people were labeled threats to state
security, enemies of the state, and enemies of the people to justify
persecution.
"In addition to criminal and terrorist organizations," wrote Dr. Alexander,
"other groups may emerge that have the ability to threaten national and
regional security." He lists some of these groups as fundamental religious
groups, groups looking for homelands, starving masses, those who are
economically deprived, and those who believe they are socially oppressed.
"These threats are both internal and external," he says.
In his book, The Franklin Cover-up, Senator DeCamp wrote, "The government's
legitimate concern with national security has been turned into a banner
under which government officials and judges and agencies and politicians
can, and do get away with almost anything and everything."(**)
I knew law enforcement and the intelligence community had their problems,
like most institutions do. I had also heard scattered stories of people
being harassed by government agencies but I attributed it to their own
fault. I figured they must have been some serious troublemakers in order to
provoke it. I thought the occasional media leaks were pretty much all there
was to it. I trusted that the "watch-dog" media kept those agencies in line
and were perhaps even a little intrusive (preventing these agencies from
doing their jobs).
I believed that they would never spend resources to target innocent people,
especially a nobody. I thought that they had better things to do than to
waste resources targeting innocent citizens. I was wrong. I never realized
that those media leaks were just the tip of the iceberg or how big and
organized this corruption was.
There is evidently a list that people are added to. Once someone is added to
this list, they are open to all manner of experimentation with surveillance
and Directed Energy Weapons. Once someone is labeled a threat to national
security - anything goes. There are no laws preventing this. No mainstream
organization to this date has made a genuine effort to expose this program.
It appears that there are multiple ways a person can be added to this list.
Whistleblowers
Government whistleblowers or whistleblowers of a corporation that is closely
associated with the government may be targeted. Some people are convinced
that they were targeted because they exposed corporate or government
corruption. Leuren Moret, for instance, was targeted after exposing hazards
relating to depleted uranium at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
Constantine described, "The whistle-blower is forced out, frightening
workmates and supporters... The assault continues" he says, "until the
target is left discredited, exhausted, in poor health, financially crippled,
his career in ruins." He explained that the objective is to portray them as
"incompetent, disloyal, troublesome, mentally unbalanced or ill."
Protestors
Civil rights activists have a history of being targeted by similar programs.
"The records show that the vast majority of the targets of domestic covert
action have engaged only in peaceful protest," declared Glick in War At
Home. "They do no harm to anyone's health or safely. The only danger they
pose is to the status quo. Their only weapon is the power of their words and
the threat of their good example."
On March 10, 1986, The Guardian stated in an article called, Peace Women
Fear Electronic Zapping at Base, that about 40 people experienced headaches,
dizziness, an inability to concentrate, and memory loss after protesting
outside a U.S. military base in England. "Doctors are compiling a report on
the condition of a number of Greenham Common peace women who have had
symptoms which are consistent with the known neurophysiological effects of
electromagnetic waves, or low level radiation," stated the Guardian.
The article continued, "Dr. Stephen Farrow, Chairman of the Medical Campaign
against Nuclear Weapons said yesterday: 'We are now compiling evidence about
the claims made by the women.' Dr. Farrow, who is senior lecturer in
epidemiology at the University College of Wales Medical College, said that
academic research into similar claims was being conducted in Canada."
An article in the Associated Press on April 15, 1995, entitled, Government
Wants Me Dead, reported that a lawyer named Linda Thompson filed a complaint
at the Marion County Prosecutors Office stating that the government was
trying to kill her with radio frequency weapons. The article went on to
explain how Thompson claimed that six of her friends had already been killed
this way.
According to a December 4, 2003 article in The Village Voice, entitled, J.
Edgar Hoover Back at the 'New' FBI, even peaceful protesters are now being
labeled as potential "terrorists." One need only look at the objectives of
the Think Tanks which clearly state that they intend to abolish the
constitution and merge America into a single world government. Therefore,
anyone who publicly opposes the New World Order, or any of its related
agendas such as the WTO, NAFTA, CAFTA, FTAA, the Federal Reserve, etc., may
be targeted. Anyone involved in the 9/11-truth movement is a potential
target.
Independent investigative journalist Greg Szymanski, who has written for the
American Free Press, and has appeared on the Republic Broadcasting Network
and the Genesis Communications Network, interviewed a man that has been
targeted due to uncovering some information regarding 9/11. Apparently this
man has been stalked by helicopters, hit with microwave weapons, and has
been on the receiving end of death threats and multiple attempted murders,
including staged accidents.
The Seattle Times ran an article in April of 2000, called, Crowd-Control
Cookery, which described, when "unruly demonstrators disrupting World Trade
Organization talks clashed with police," they "had at their disposal a
new... arsenal designed to sting, stun, entrap, immobilize, sicken, knock
the wind out of - but not kill - the assailants, suspects, agitators or
enemies they are used against." They continued, "They're referred to
collectively as non-lethal weapons, and police and military units are
increasingly using them as they try to limit the use of deadly force... Many
of the nation's major urban police forces already use some of these
weapons..."
This program may be particularly useful for subduing people who are too high
profile, or for whatever reason can't be outright murdered. Say, for
instance, if someone is quite troublesome to the elite, they can be given
cancer, and psychologically tortured to impede their progress. Or in the
words of Dr. Alexander, the program can be used to "neuter" them. Parents
and children of targeted individuals are also being targeted for apparent
purposes of intimidation. All done under the banner of "national security."
The Cleveland Plain Dealer ran an article on in June 1991, entitled,
Psychiatrist Testifies at Mom's Hearing. Apparently a woman in Ohio killed
one of her daughters to spare her from further trauma, after they had been
targeted for two years with torture, consisting of burns and sexual
degradation by V2K. Prior to this she wrote a multitude of letters to the
pentagon, government officials, and talk show hosts describing her plight.
Her doctor told the Dealer, "she has a number of delusions... [about] being
repeatedly attacked and tortured by government agencies." He continued,
"[her] unwillingness to understand her illness kept her from weighing the
possibilities of her defense." Her attacks reportedly continued while she
was imprisoned.
McKinney wrote of one protester who received a call stating that, "if she
valued the lives of her children," then she would drop her public opposition
to a company's installation of high power lines. "Since receiving that
threat," declared McKinney, "the individual's 11-year old daughter has been
reduced to extremes of pain, resulting in her recurrent hospitalization for
treatment of illnesses which cannot be diagnosed. It is now also apparent to
this individual that her three-year-old son is on the receiving end of
externally-induced auditory input [V2K]."
Similarly, the Stasi would target families. Fulbrook described, "The
children and relatives of dissidents might be subjected to harassment and
personal disadvantage." She added, "People could emerge with their health,
self-confidence and future working lives damaged beyond recovery."
Experimentation
Part of the Hidden Evil seems to be testing the latest in surveillance and
Directed Energy Weapons. MKULTRA, a known mind-control project, with 149
sub-projects, was conducted in universities, hospitals, military
institutions, and prisons. According to author Jim Keith, under MKULTRA
about 23,000 people were traumatized, but researchers in this are see this
as an extremely conservative number. Since many of the records have been
destroyed we will probably never know. Likewise, the Stasi burnt out many
paper-shredding machines destroying their victim file evidence.
The paper trail for these experiments ended around 1984. But evidence
reveals that it never stopped. "It would appear that the CIA's and FBI's
Operations MKULTRA, MHCHAOS and COINTELPRO," were "merely driven
underground," stated McKinney. Labs are no longer necessary as Directed
Energy Weapons can be used at a distance, and plain-clothed citizen brigades
are complicit in public harassment.
Recruitment
It appears that some people are targeted with the intent to recruit them as
informants after they've been broken. Both the East German Stasi and the CIA
would use constant harassment campaigns on people they wanted to recruit as
informants, or people knew they couldn't recruit and wanted to destroy.
Political Movement
Although whistleblowers, activists
and others have been targeted, the scope of this worldwide program is too
big for it to be limited to a parallel justice system. As previously
illustrated, there is probably a political agenda attached to the Hidden
Evil. According to both McKinney and Moret, it has moved beyond
experimentation and is being widely used on the civilian population in all
NATO countries. Dr. Kilde adds, "Today ANYONE can become a target, even
those who invented the system." [Emphasis in original]
The controlling-elite are not individually picking targeted individuals, so
there must be people on the local level, charged with the task of
identifying people to target. McKinney has found that Corporate America is
another medium for detecting TIs. This is not surprising because many of
them run surveillance operations for government agencies.
McKinney declared that in the past 15 years, she has "had occasion to
observe many, many, many instances of individuals in the corporate
environment being singled out and targeted." It seems there are people in
communities and businesses who identify people to be put under surveillance.
This is very similar to what unfolded in East Germany, where workplaces,
schools, and hospitals were complicit in surveillance operations and filled
with informants.
What are the qualities that local agents are to look for when profiling
targets? We may never know for sure. But Annie Earle's non-profit
organization, An Ethical Light, has done some research on those alleging to
be targeted. She acknowledged, "There does seem to be a certain profile
among the victims we have studied." She describes them as "generally very
highly intelligent people..." She says that the people her organization
deals with "represent a wide range [of] every type of profession you can
imagine."
The women who are singled out tend to be independent, intelligent, and
confident professionals. "There's a heavy predominance of those types of
woman in the TI community," affirmed McKinney. Men are in a smaller
proportion, and tend to be non-conformists. They usually have a "sense of
self-esteem and pride that seems to invite targeting," she says. Remember,
the MfS was a criminal federal police force that deliberately singled out
people exactly like this on a massive scale.
Others that have been targeted include:
-
Those who have had a bad breakup with an
ex-spouse who has influence
-
Criminals (Targeting known offenders may
strengthen the illusion that the program is legitimate)
-
Those who have reported a crime where
the perpetrator was a member of an organized crime ring
-
Landowners targeted by government or
industry for land seizures
-
Gays, minorities
-
Inventors awaiting a large payoff
-
Mentally disabled
-
Those who have had arguments with
neighbors who have connections
-
Those awaiting a large insurance claim
-
Convenient targets of opportunity
-
Those with special talents or abilities
-
Group members who act in unacceptable
ways
-
Independent freethinkers who are not
part of the herd
-
Those who are perceived as vulnerable or
weak
-
Those opposing any element the New World
Order
The pattern that is unfolding indicates that
many targets are people who tend to be emotionally developed,
self-confident, independent, free thinkers, artistic, people who don't need
the approval of others, and those not prone to corruption.
They're people who don't need to be part of a
group to feel secure - generally people who are not part of the herd. The
financial elite throughout history have consistently hated and feared these
individuals. There's one other type of person that the financial elite hate
- truth tellers. They absolutely hate them.
This is apparently why whistleblowers are
targeted.
Those on the local level, who are given the authority to identify people to
be targeted, are evidently a reflection of their military-industrial
handlers. The profile of those who are likely responsible for the Hidden
Evil, has been established as: greedy, deceitful, psychopathic, and
cowardly. Therefore, envy, jealousy, and fear may also play a significant
role in the selection of targeted people. On a smaller but similar scale,
Mobbing targets are selected for these exact reasons.
The book Mobbing states,
"Envy, jealousy, aspirations, and being
challenged are reasons individuals mob."
They charge,
"[people] might resent someone for
performing better, for looking better, for being more liked. They fear
others' competence."
Eugenics
For some reason, there are considerably more women targeted than men. Why
would women be targeted at a much higher percentage than men? This is
another question we may never have the answer for. So this is partially
speculation. But one possible answer is that the elite have sponsored
eugenics projects worldwide for decades. Removing fertile females from a
target population is apparently a standard eugenics procedure. Families such
as DuPont, Harriman, and Rockefeller have funded projects for population
control.
"It was John D. Rockefeller III who was appointed by Richard Nixon as
chairman of the newly created Commission on Population Growth and the
American Future," stated Allen. He quotes Rockefeller as saying, "Rather
than think of population control as a negative thing, we should see that it
can be enriching." Allen contends, "Curbing population growth is just part
of the Rockefeller war on the American family."
Author Marrs wrote, "The Harrimans... along with the Rockefellers funded
more than $11 million to create a eugenics research laboratory at Cold
Spring Harbor, New York, as well as eugenics studies at Harvard, Columbia,
and Cornell." And according to author Jim Keith, eugenics programs in Nazi
Germany were organized and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.
The Hidden Evil is probably not employed strictly as a means of population
control due to its delayed results and the amount of resources it consumes.
However, because it is life-destroying in nature, the financial elite may
see the targeting of women as an accent to their existing eugenics programs.
Apparently, these eugenics projects are ongoing. Author Marrs declared,
"Eugenics work, under more politically correct names, continues right up
today." Keith agreed, writing, "In 1905, in the United States, the
Rockefellers and Carnegies constructed the Eugenics Records Office at Cold
Springs Harbor, New York, where genetic research... is still being done."
They're Monsters
The last reason may be very difficult for some people to accept because it
is simple and sadistic. It is this: They are picking people out of
communities and violently murdering them because that's the type of people
they are. This mind-set is probably completely alien to most people. Because
most of us don't entertain these thoughts, it's difficult to imagine how
another person could. But, insanity is the reason. Evil is the reason. This
will be easier to understand when we explore the Satanic and psychopathic
factors in future chapters.
Summary
Genuinely decent people are being systematically targeted by this cabal
which, through propaganda and deception, has extended its influence all the
way down into the neighborhood level.
If you're a protestor, whistleblower, or they
just don't like you, you can be labeled a "threat to national security."
Once that occurs, you may have to watch as your children are slowly tortured
and murdered with this technology. You will also be Gang Stalked by
citizens' watch groups composed of men, woman, and children.
The military, a member of congress, and the
alleged creators of these weapons have publicly said that they will be used
on civilians.
Footnotes
* When Congressman Scheur uses the word "we"
I tend to believe he's referring to himself and other members of
congress, or himself and the military/police, or both.
** Shockingly, during his investigation of an elite-sponsored pedophile
ring with ties to Washington D.C., DeCamp discovered that the children
were told that their participation was in aid of "national security."
