# NSA Infiltrates Links to Yahoo and Google Data Centers Worldwide - 
Snowden Documents Say

According to a top-secret
accounting dated Jan. 9, 2013, the NSAs acquisitions
directorate sends millions of records every day from
internal Yahoo and Google networks to data warehouses at
the agencys headquarters at Fort Meade, Md.
In the preceding 30 days, the report said,
field collectors had processed and sent back 181,280,466 new records -
including "metadata," which would indicate who sent or received e-mails
and when, as well as content such as text, audio and video.
The NSAs principal tool to exploit the data
links is a project called
MUSCULAR, operated jointly with the agencys British counterpart,
the
Government Communications Headquarters.
From undisclosed
interception points, the NSA and the GCHQ are copying entire data flows
across fiber-optic cables that carry information among the data centers
of the Silicon Valley giants.
The infiltration is especially striking
because the NSA, under a separate program
known as PRISM, has front-door access to Google and Yahoo user
accounts through a court-approved process.
The MUSCULAR project appears to be an
unusually aggressive use of NSA tradecraft against flagship American
companies. The agency is built for high-tech spying, with a wide range
of digital tools, but it has not been known to use them routinely
against U.S. companies.
In a statement, the NSA
said it
is,
"focused on discovering and developing
intelligence about valid foreign intelligence targets only."
"NSA applies Attorney General-approved
processes to protect the privacy of U.S. persons - minimizing the
likelihood of their information in our targeting, collection,
processing, exploitation, retention, and dissemination," it said.
In a statement, Googles chief legal
officer, David Drummond,
said the company has,
"long been concerned about the
possibility of this kind of snooping" and has not provided the
government with access to its systems.
"We are outraged at the lengths to which
the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private
fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform," he
said.
A Yahoo spokeswoman said,
"We have strict controls in place to
protect the security of our data centers, and we have not given
access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government
agency."
Under PRISM, the NSA gathers huge volumes of
online communications records by legally compelling U.S. technology
companies, including Yahoo and Google, to turn over any data that match
court-approved search terms.
That program, which was first
disclosed by The Washington Post and the Guardian newspaper in
Britain, is authorized under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act and
overseen by the ForeignIntelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).
John Schindler, a
former NSA chief analyst and frequent defender who
teaches at the Naval War College, said it is obvious why
the agency would prefer to avoid restrictions where it
can.
"Look, NSA has platoons of lawyers, and
their entire job is figuring out how to stay within the law and
maximize collection by exploiting every loophole," he said.
"Its fair to say the rules are less
restrictive under Executive Order 12333 than they are under FISA,"
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
In a statement, the Office of the Director
of National Intelligence denied that it was using executive authority to
"get around the limitations" imposed by FISA.
The operation to infiltrate data links
exploits a fundamental weakness in systems architecture. To guard
against data loss and system slowdowns, Google and Yahoo maintain
fortress-like
data centers across four continents and connect them with thousands
of miles of fiber-optic cable.
Data move seamlessly around these
globe-spanning "cloud" networks, which represent billions of dollars of
investment.
For the data centers to operate effectively,
they synchronize large volumes of information about account holders.
Yahoos internal network, for example, sometimes transmits entire e-mail
archives - years of messages and attachments - from one data center to
another.
Tapping the Google and Yahoo clouds allows
the NSA to intercept communications in real time and to take "a
retrospective look at target activity," according to one internal NSA
document.
To obtain free access to data- center
traffic, the NSA had to circumvent gold-standard security measures.
Google "goes to great lengths to protect
the data and intellectual property in these centers," according to
one of the companys
blog posts, with tightly audited access controls, heat-sensitive
cameras, round-the-clock guards and biometric verification of
identities.
Google and Yahoo also pay for premium data
links, designed to be faster, more reliable and more secure. In recent
years, both of them are said to have bought
or leased thousands of miles of fiber-optic cables for their own
exclusive use.
They had reason to think, insiders said,
that their private, internal networks were safe from prying eyes.
In an
NSA presentation slide on "Google Cloud Exploitation," however,
a sketch shows where the "Public Internet" meets the internal
"Google Cloud" where their data reside. In hand-printed letters,
the drawing notes that encryption is "added and removed here!"
The artist adds a smiley face, a cheeky celebration of victory
over Google security.
Two engineers with close ties to Google
exploded in profanity when they saw the drawing.
"I hope you publish this," one of them
said.
For the MUSCULAR project, the GCHQ
directs all intake into a "buffer" that can hold three to five days of
traffic before recycling storage space.
From the buffer, custom-built NSA
tools unpack and decode the special data formats that the two companies
use inside their clouds. Then the data are sent through a series of
filters to "select" information the NSA wants and "defeat" what it does
not.
PowerPoint slides about the Google cloud,
for example, show that the NSA tries to filter out all data from the
companys "Web crawler," which indexes Internet pages.
According to the briefing documents,
prepared by participants in the MUSCULAR project, collection from inside
Yahoo and Google has produced important intelligence leads against
hostile foreign governments that are specified in the documents.
Last month, long before The Post approached
Google to discuss the penetration of its cloud, Eric Grosse, vice
president for security engineering, said the company is rushing to
encrypt the links between its data centers.
"Its an arms race," he said then. "We
see these government agencies as among the most skilled players in
this game."
Yahoo has not announced plans to encrypt its
data-center links.
Because digital communications and cloud
storage do not usually adhere to national boundaries, MUSCULAR and a
previously disclosed NSA operation to collect Internet address books
have amassed content and metadata on a previously unknown scale from
U.S. citizens and residents.
Those operations have gone undebated in
public or in Congress because their existence was classified.
The Google and Yahoo operations call
attention to an asymmetry in U.S. surveillance law.
Although Congress has lifted some
restrictions on NSA domestic surveillance on grounds that purely foreign
communications sometimes pass over U.S. switches and cables, it has not
added restrictions overseas, where American communications or data
stores now cross over foreign switches.
"Thirty-five years ago, different
countries had their own telecommunications infrastructure, so the
division between foreign and domestic collection was clear," Sen.
Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the intelligence panel, said in an
interview.
"Today theres a global communications
infrastructure, so theres a greater risk of collecting on Americans
when the NSA collects overseas."
It is not clear how much data from Americans
is collected and how much of that is retained.
One weekly report on MUSCULAR says the
British operators of the site allow the NSA to contribute 100,000
"selectors," or search terms. That is more than twice the number in use
in the PRISM program, but even 100,000 cannot easily account for the
millions of records that are said to be sent to Fort Meade each day.
In 2011, when the FISC learned that the NSA
was using similar methods to collect and analyze data streams - on a
much smaller scale - from cables on U.S. territory, Judge John D.
Bates ruled that the program was illegal under FISA and inconsistent
with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.
