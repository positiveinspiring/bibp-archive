If Argentina were in a high-stakes chess
match, the country's actions this week would be the equivalent of
flipping over all the pieces on the board.

Fiscal Times, August 22, 2014
Argentina is playing hardball with
the vulture
funds, which have been trying to force it into an involuntary bankruptcy.
The vultures are demanding what amounts to a
600% return on bonds bought for pennies on the dollar, defeating a 2005
settlement in which 92% of creditors agreed to accept a 70% haircut on their
bonds.
A U.S. court has backed the vulture funds; but
last week, Argentina sidestepped its jurisdiction by transferring the
trustee for payment from Bank of New York Mellon to its own central bank.
That play, if approved by the Argentine Congress, will allow the country to
continue making payments under its 2005 settlement, avoiding default on the
majority of its bonds.
Argentina is already foreclosed from
international capital markets, so it doesn't have much to lose by thwarting
the U.S. court system. Similar bold moves by Ecuador and
Iceland have left
those countries in substantially better shape than Greece, which went along
with the agendas of the international financiers.
The upside for Argentina was captured by
President Cristina Fernandez in a nationwide speech on August 19th.
Struggling to hold back tears,
according to Bloomberg, she said:
When it comes to the sovereignty of our
country and the conviction that we can no longer be extorted and that we
can't become burdened with debt again, we are emerging as Argentines.
...If I signed what they're trying to make
me sign, the bomb wouldn't explode now but rather there would surely be
applause, marvelous headlines in the papers. But we would enter into the
infernal cycle of debt which we've been subject to for so long.
The Endgame - Patagonia
in the Crosshairs
The deeper implications of that infernal debt
cycle were explored by Argentine political analyst Adrian Salbuchi in
an August 12th article titled "Sovereign
Debt for Territory - A New Global Elite Swap Strategy."
Where territories were once captured by military
might, he maintains that today they are being annexed by debt. The
still-evolving plan is to drive destitute nations into an international
bankruptcy court whose decisions would have the force of law throughout the
world.
The court could then do with whole countries
what U.S. bankruptcy courts do with businesses:
sell off their assets,
including their real estate.
Sovereign territories could be acquired as the
spoils of bankruptcy without a shot being fired.
Global financiers and interlocking
mega-corporations are increasingly supplanting governments on the
international stage. An international bankruptcy court would be one more
institution making that takeover legally binding and enforceable.
Governments can say no to the strong-arm tactics
of the global bankers' collection agency, the IMF. An international
bankruptcy court would allow creditors to force a nation into bankruptcy,
where territories could be involuntarily sold off in the same way that
assets of bankrupt corporations are.
For Argentina, says Salbuchi, the likely prize
is its
very rich Patagonia region, long a favorite settlement target for
ex-pats.
When Argentina suffered a massive default in 2001, the global
press, including Time and The New York Times, went so far
as to propose that Patagonia be ceded from the country as a defaulted debt
payment mechanism.
The New York Times article
followed one published in the Buenos Aires financial newspaper El
Cronista Comercial called "Debt for Territory," which
described a proposal by a U.S. consultant to then-president Eduardo Duhalde
for swapping public debt for government land.
It said:
[T]he idea would be to transform our public
debt default into direct equity investment in which creditors can become
land owners where they can develop industrial, agricultural and real
estate projects...
There could be surprising candidates for
this idea: during the Alfonsin Administration, the Japanese studied an
investment master plan in Argentine land in order to promote
emigration. The proposal was also considered in Israel.
Salbuchi notes that ceding Patagonia from
Argentina was first suggested in 1896 by Theodor Herzl, founder of the
Zionist movement, as a second settlement for that movement.
Another article published in 2002 was one by IMF
deputy manager Anne Krueger titled "Should Countries Like Argentina
Be Able to Declare Themselves Bankrupt?"
It was posted on the IMF website
and proposed some "new and creative ideas" on what to do about Argentina.
Krueger said,
"the lesson is clear: we need better
incentives to bring debtors and creditors together before manageable
problems turn into full-blown crises," adding that the IMF
believes "this could be done by learning from corporate bankruptcy
regimes like Chapter 11 in the U.S.".
These ideas were developed in greater detail by
Ms. Krueger in an IMF essay titled "A New Approach to Debt Restructuring,"
and by Harvard professor Richard N. Cooper in a 2002 article titled "Chapter
11 for Countries" published in Foreign Affairs ("mouthpiece of the
powerful New York-Based Elite think-tank, Council on Foreign Relations").
Salbuchi writes:
Here, Cooper very matter-of-factly
recommends that "only if the debtor nation cannot restore its
financial health are its assets liquidated and the proceeds distributed
to its creditors - again under the guidance of a (global) court" (!).
In Argentina's recent tangle with the vulture
funds, Ms. Krueger and the mainstream media have come out in apparent
defense of Argentina, recommending restraint by the U.S. court.
But according
to Salbuchi, this does not represent a change in policy.
Rather, the concern is that overly heavy-handed
treatment may kill the golden goose:
...[I]n today's delicate post-2008 banking
system, a new and less controllable sovereign debt crisis could thwart
the global elite's plans for an "orderly transition towards a new
global legal architecture" that will allow orderly liquidation of
financially-failed states like Argentina.
Especially if such debt were to be
collateralized by its national territory (what else is left!?)
Breaking Free from the
Sovereign Debt Trap
Salbuchi traces Argentina's debt crisis back to
1955, when President Juan Domingo Perón was ousted in a very bloody
U.S./UK/mega-bank-sponsored military coup:
Perón
was hated for his insistence on not indebting Argentina with the
mega-bankers: in 1946 he rejected joining
the International Monetary
Fund (IMF); in 1953 he fully paid off all of Argentina's sovereign debt.
So, once the mega-bankers got rid of him in
1956, they shoved Argentina into the IMF and created the "Paris Club" to
engineer decades-worth of sovereign debt for vanquished Argentina,
something they've been doing until today.
Many countries have been subjected to similar
treatment, as John Perkins documents in his blockbuster exposé
Confessions of an Economic Hit Man.
When the country cannot pay, the IMF sweeps in
with refinancing agreements with strings attached, including selling off
public assets and slashing public services in order to divert government
revenues into foreign debt service.
Even without pressure from economic hit men,
however, governments routinely indebt themselves for much more than they can
ever hope to repay.
Why do they do it?
Salbuchi writes:
Here, Western economists, bankers, traders,
Ivy League academics and professors, Nobel laureates and the mainstream
media have a quick and monolithic reply:
because all nations need "investment and
investors" if they wish to build highways, power plants, schools,
airports, hospitals, raise armies, service infrastructures and a
long list of et ceteras...
But more and more people are starting to ask
a fundamental common-sense question:
why should governments indebt themselves
in hard currencies, decades into the future with global
mega-bankers, when they could just as well finance these projects
and needs far more safely by issuing the proper amounts of their own
local sovereign currency instead?
Neoliberal experts shout back that
government-created money devalues the currency, inflates the money supply,
and destroys economies.
But does it? Or is it the debt service on money
created privately by banks, along with other forms of
"rent" on capital,
that create inflation and destroy economies?
As Prof. Michael Hudson
points out:
These financial claims on wealth - bonds,
mortgages and bank loans - are lent out to become somebody else's debts
in an exponentially expanding process...
[E]conomies have been obliged to pay their
debts by cutting back new research, development and new physical
reinvestment.
This is the essence of IMF austerity plans,
in which the currency is "stabilized" by further international borrowing
on terms that destabilize the economy at large. Such cutbacks in
long-term investment also are the product of corporate raids financed by
high-interest junk bonds.
The debts created by businesses, consumers
and national economies cutting back their long-term direct investment
leaves these entities even less able to carry their mounting debt
burden.
Spiraling debt also results in price inflation,
since businesses have to raise their prices to cover the interest and fees
on the debt.
From Sovereign Debt to
Monetary Sovereignty
For governments to escape this austerity trap,
they need to spend not less but more money on the tangible capital formation
that increases physical productivity.
But,
The common-sense response, as Salbuchi observes,
is for governments to issue the money they need directly.
But "printing money" raises outcries that can be
difficult to overcome politically.
An alternative that can have virtually
the same effect is for nations to borrow money issued by their own
publicly-owned banks. Public banks generate credit just as private banks do;
but unlike private lenders, they return interest and profits to the economy.
Their mandate is to serve the public, and that
is where their profits go.
Funding through their own government-issued
currencies and publicly-owned banks has been successfully pursued by many
countries historically, including:
-
Australia
-
New Zealand
-
Canada
-
Germany
-
China
-
Russia
-
Korea
-
Japan
(For more on this, see
The Public Bank Solution.)
Countries do need to be able to buy foreign
products that they cannot acquire or produce domestically, and for that they
need a form of currency or an international credit line that other nations
will accept.
But countries are increasingly breaking away
from the oil- and weapons-backed U.S. dollar as global reserve currency. To
resolve the mutually-destructive currency wars will probably take a new
Bretton Woods Accord.
But that is another subject for a later article.
