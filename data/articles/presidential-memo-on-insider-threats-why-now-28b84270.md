On the day before Thanksgiving with little or no
media attention, President Obama
wrote a memorandum, which is an unofficial directive,
to the heads of
executive departments and agencies that addresses insider threats.
While the corporate media has largely ignored
this memo, there has recently been much speculation in alternative media as
to why Obama felt the need to address insider threats at this time.
The subject heading of the memo is National
Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider
Threat Programs.
Origin
It is short enough to reprint in its entirety:
This
Presidential Memorandum transmits the National Insider Threat Policy and
Minimum Standards for Executive Branch (Minimum Standards) to provide
direction and guidance to promote the development of effective insider
threat programs within departments and agencies to deter, detect, and
mitigate actions by employees who may represent a threat to national
security.
These threats
encompass potential espionage, violent acts against the Government or
the Nation, and unauthorized disclosure of classified information,
including the vast amounts of classified data available on
interconnected United States Government computer networks and systems.
The Minimum
Standards provide departments and agencies with the minimum elements
necessary to establish effective insider threat programs.
These
elements include the capability to gather, integrate, and centrally
analyze and respond to key threat-related information; monitor employee
use of classified networks; provide the workforce with insider threat
awareness training; and protect the civil liberties and privacy of all
personnel.
The resulting
insider threat capabilities will strengthen the protection of classified
information across the executive branch and reinforce our defenses
against both adversaries and insiders who misuse their access and
endanger our national security.
Much of the speculation regarding this memo is a
result of the brevity and ambiguous wording.
For example, what exactly defines an insider
threat and why are violent acts against the Government or the Nation
mentioned? Recent events raise even more questions.
After a closer look at some of the theories
regarding why Obama felt the need to write this now, readers can draw their
own conclusions.
Stifling whistleblowers
This memo obviously urges an expansion of powers
granted to the
Insider Threat Task Force that was created by an
executive order in October 2011, ten months after Army Private
Bradley Manning retrieved roughly 250,000 diplomatic cables from a
government computer and turned them over to
Wikileaks.
Bradley Manning is facing hearings this week
that could lead to him being imprisoned for life, after already being
imprisoned in solitary confinement since May 2010.
If that is not enough of a deterrent for
whistleblowers in the military, what is?
Jesselyn Radack,
writing for the DailyKOS,
correctly points out that this memo,
serves to reinforce the Obama
administration's woeful confusion of whistleblowing with espionage
[and]
is completely redundant as agencies already have internal
policies on classified information and secrecy agreements.
Radack continues to advance the theory that the
memo is meant to stifle whistleblowers like Bradley Manning,
Thomas Drake and
John Kiriakou.
Yet she once again correctly notes that,
the memo equates disclosure of classified
information with violent acts against the government and espionage,
a certainly inapt and chilling comparison considering that
an employee
taking violent acts to overthrow the government or conducting espionage
is a rare occurrence whereas classified information appears on the front
pages of national newspapers daily.
In fact, the
New York Times pointed out last year that anywhere from 50 percent to 90
percent of classified documents could safely be made public.
Kevin Gosztola, who has been following
the Bradley Manning case, appeared on
RT with a similar assessment (see above video):
During the clip, I point out the policy is
extraneous as it is already official policy for national security agency
employees to not release classified information without proper
authorization. This adds another layer of procedures meant to chill
speech and whistleblowing.
Gosztala takes it one step further when he
writes,
it is an indication that the Obama
administration, which prosecuted more whistleblowers or leakers in the
past four years under the Espionage Act than any other previous
administration, has a disposition against the free flow of information.
It is quite possible that Obama wrote the memo
with Mannings case and other whistleblowers in mind, yet many speculate
that there is much more to it.
Obviously, none of these whistleblowers were
plotting violent acts against the nation and it is a safe assumption that a
President who is an ex-constitutional law professor can make a distinction
between whistleblowing, espionage and violent acts against the nation.
Expansion of executive powers
Beginning with
the
Bush administration, there
has been a
rapid expansion of executive powers in government and the Obama
administration has continued that trend with unprecedented bills such as the
National Defense Authorization Act (S.1867) and the
Federal Restricted Building and Grounds Improvement Act (HR 347).
It is a legitimate concern that the insider
threat memo is a directive authorizing a further expansion of executive
powers.
David Hagmann,
writing for the Canada Free Press,
makes some good points when he interprets Obamas memo in a broader
perspective. Like others, he points out the ambiguity in the wording and
acknowledges that it could just be geared at stopping leaks.
Hagmann,
however, takes note of a key word in the memo.
The word is centrally, and when it is
considered in the context of Obamas agenda seen being implemented over the
last four years, it is chilling:
The key
to understanding this memorandum is to understand that we are witnessing
the greatest consolidation of power and control under the Executive
branch of the government in recent U.S. history.
This
process creates a closed system of surveillance that cannot be easily
penetrated by other branches of
government.
Accordingly, it becomes a self-policing network that has the ability to
silence critics and individuals opposing a particular agenda or
activity, even if such dissent is lawful
it gives Barack Hussein Obama
the ability to redefine what constitutes a threat to the government,
including treason.
It is he, not laws enacted
by congress or the workings of the judicial branch, who will now
determine who and what constitutes an insider threat.
It is the
very essence of Big Brother within the government itself. Everyone
needs to wake up and understand exactly whats happening not only in the
U.S., but across the world.
We are
witnessing the consolidation of power that historically precedes a war
for absolute control.
Hagmanns analysis encompasses the stifling of
whistleblowers and takes it a step further to the stifling of any dissent
within government agencies.
Like Gosztala and Radack, he acknowledges the
ambiguity in the wording. Unlike both, however, he fails to mention that the
mechanisms for stifling whistleblowers and any form of dissent were already
in place before this memo was written.
So, the question still remains, why would Obama
feel the need to write this memo now?
Real insider threats
The words violent acts against the government
or the nation have rang the alarm bells of several writers who have covered
this memo.
Most seem to think they are out of context with
the insider threats vaguely described in the memo. But that may not be the
case. President Obama may be beginning to feel threatened by not only people
within his administration, but also by people in this country (the U.S.).
One context to put that into is that President
Obama has received more death threats than any President in U.S. history.
At
least two
blogs have referenced Secret Service sources that say death threats to
the President have increased by over 400 percent since Obama took office in
2008 and amount to about 30 per day.
That's
43,830 death threats for his first four years alone. Of course, that is
impossible to verify because the media and not even the President is made
aware of all threats against him.
As the Secret Service says,
"the sheer number would be overwhelming and,
frankly, distracting."
Combined with the recent shooting of
Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, the
spike in gun sales after the election, and many who have signed
petitions for secession, the words violent acts and insider threats
make more sense.
Some writers, such as Gordon Duff writing for
Press TV, have gone as far as to claim that Obamas memo may be a preemptive
response to an Israeli assassination attempt or an effort by AIPAC-backed
groups to overthrow the U.S. government. Whether or not real threats of
violence are from domestic insiders or foreign infiltrators, they cannot sit
well with any President regardless of party affiliation.
As usual, the truth probably lies somewhere in
between.
The question then becomes,
Neither one seems good for Americans right
now.
