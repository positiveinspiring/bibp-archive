Question: Awareness has given some of the information in bits and
pieces of what this question from R.C., of Snellings, California,
is, but he writes:
"Would you ask Cosmic Awareness to discuss the
aliens, Greys and so forth, and Reptilians' social order, social
structure, political and ideological systems, and their concept of
self and their psychological sciences? What is their basic core
concepts found in their culture?
Perhaps an evolutionary rundown of
the historical past of these creatures; perhaps a discussion of the
governmental system they have set up on conquered planets might also
be in order. What are the aliens' weaknesses? Can they be killed,
and if so, how? What languages do they speak, and what is this
linguistic relationship to their culture and world views, should be
explained. Thank you."
A:
This Awareness indicates that much of this was discussed previously;
that the general relationship of the Zeta Reticuli [The Greys] to
one another as that which is likened unto a hive mind in which the
social order is somewhat akin to a group mind, whereby they find it
difficult to act individually.
This is one of the weaknesses for
them in that if you present them with a problem, they cannot decide
what to do without consulting someone up the ladder in the chain of
command, if they are as a group in a situation, and there is,
therefore, a pause of as much as 15 seconds while they attune to
someone in higher levels for decision.
If those in higher levels do not have a particular individual role
in the affairs of that group, they too might be in a position where
they have to consult each other to reach a consensus or to appeal to
someone in a higher level before making a decision. They find it
quite difficult to make decisions individually.
This Awareness
indicates that this is not the same in the Reptoid alien group.
These entities are more individualistic, much the way humans are.
They can act on their own, though they do have a kind of hierarchy
order, and operate under a certain amount of respect for authority.
This Awareness indicates that the respect for authority keeps them
in line, so that they recognize a certain limitation as to what they
are allowed or not allowed to do in terms of action. The social
order of the Reptoids is more that of a hierarchy system, that of
the Zeta Reticuli more likened unto a hive mind.
This does not mean
that an individual Zeta Reticuli could not react if threatened, but
rather that if unthreatened, if the entity is confronted with a
choice; he or she may not be able to make the choice without
consulting others in the process of setting a policy for the
situation.
This Awareness indicates that it is the same for these entities in
their own home structures in regard to their culture.
This Awareness
indicates that it has discussed already the background history of
the Zetas in a similar question asked yesterday; that these entities
came from a planet that was basically dying and they as a race were
dying from excessive exposure to radiation and the Reptilians or Reptoids from Draco assisted them and therefore, extracted loyalty
from them. For their obedience and loyalty they were asked to work
as mercenaries in the Reptoid conquest of various planets.
The question asked about what kind of government structure would be
set up on the planets they controlled... This Awareness indicates
that on Earth these entities received directions from their earlier
formulated plans of their own hierarchy system.
They generally have
a kind of allegiance to the Orion network or empire, those from
Orion who are the thinkers and politicians and these entities set up
the structure of government. The Reptoids are the basic enforcers of
the structure.
The Orion Alliance creates structures on the planets run by
hierarchy and controlled by money systems and the Reptoids enforce
the allegiance to these structures and control the masses, and for
this they are allowed what may be termed 'rape and pillage'
privileges. This Awareness indicates the Zetas support the Reptoids
and the Reptoids support and derive authority from the Orion Empire.
This Awareness indicates the more friendly aliens such as the
Pleiadians, Arcturians and those from Sirius and others, work
through
the Galactic Confederation and reach their alliances and
agreements through general consensus and vote. They have a general
policy to avoid intrusion into the affairs of others, unless those
affairs threaten the affairs of still others who are not involved.
Thus, if the Earth is involved in activities which might threaten
other nearby planets, they would have the right to interfere.
The Confederation did interfere to some degree during the Cold War,
in that many of the nuclear weapons in the silos in Russia and the
United States were disarmed by the aliens during times when there
appeared to be a deep or intense danger of their being used. In
fact, the Russians, fearing the disarmament might be seen from
satellite levels, or might be detected by the United States
satellites, built dummy warheads to sit on their rockets or
missiles, to give the appearance that they were fully armed.
This Awareness indicates the Pleiadians on their planet have a kind
of democracy and structure that encourages creativity. There is very
little encouragement for violence or competition, and this helps to
keep the planet more peaceful.
They do not promote highly
competitive sports and do not glorify war and such conflicts in
their art or drama or history. Rather, they promote creativity,
compassion, service to others and many of the more idealistic
concepts that are known on Earth, but seldom practiced.
There is much emphasis on education and exploration. In the areas of
what which might be termed military, it is generally more of a
defensive activity in which they do not even speak ill of their
enemies. They may warn people of others, but they generally avoid
detailed discussions of their enemies or speaking badly about them.
The warning will often be 'to be careful' without saying why, or
what is wrong with the other enemy side. This Awareness indicates
that they prefer to isolate than to destroy their enemies, but if it
becomes absolutely necessary, they could enter into a war-like
activity that would cause destruction to their enemies.
Question: Did Awareness cover the basic core concepts of the
Reptilians' culture?
A:
This Awareness indicates that this is not fully clear as to what is
being requested in this terminology. This Awareness indicates that
these entities have a history of conquest which lies at the core of
their culture.
They enjoy the battle with others, and find a great
sense of self-importance in conquering others, and it becomes
likened unto a reason for their being. They have very little
interest in spiritual concepts unless those concepts somehow yield
power to them or can be used to gain power over others.
Their basic interest is in being in power. They enjoy the thrill of
conquest more than any other feeling. It gives them a certain rush,
much like that of a drug high, when they have conquered someone.
This Awareness indicates that they essentially live for this kind of
energy. They see humans much the way hunters might observe a herd of
deer, or sheep, or other animals in a field.
Thus, they see the
Earth as a kind of farm filled with human prey. This Awareness
indicates that there is nothing in them that experiences what may be
termed mercy or compassion for the human. They have a kind of
contempt for humans as being weak and frail, but they also have
considerable appetite for the human flesh, because of its sweetness
and tenderness.
This Awareness indicates that the Zeta Reticuli feel somewhat
different. Their background having once been very similar to humans,
having later been modified through genetic engineering to
incorporate insect and reptilian genes to become what they presently
are, being born in a sack of hundreds perhaps of genetically
engineered fetuses of Zeta Reticuli so that an entire hive or group
might be born at one time. They think of themselves in terms of
their group place and group origin, rather than as a family or
hierarchy placement.
They do not have what humans might call a pecking order, or human
bonding feelings. They do not bond with each other, but they
acknowledge each other. They do not have individual names or do not
give themselves individual names. They think more in terms of their
place. If one were to ask them who they were, they would describe
their home, their base or their group, rather than give their
personal name, because they do not tend to carry a personal name.
There have been instances in which people have given them individual
names, and eventually, the entity would get used to that. However,
the tendency is to identify with the group rather than to identify
with a personal name. They are very much into activity and have
little interest in feeling or experiential concerns. They like to do
things rather than to feel.
Humans are more in touch with their feelings than are these Zeta
Reticuli. Some of the groupings of Zetas are more war-like than
others, and some can be quite sadistic. One group tends to express
itself more politically in the sense of being more into
communicating and reacting with humans in a way that allows
communication a primary place in the relationship. The other two
groups are less inclined to communicating with humans in ways that
allow for agreement or harmony to form a rapport.
This Awareness has already spoken of the weaknesses of these
entities, especially in regard to their inability to cope with human
complexities and emotional complexities of the humans. They do not
know how to deal with unruly humans and prefer to associate with or
abduct and work with cooperative humans.
They like to pretend that
they are divine because humans tend to go along with that and
cooperate with them in whatever they wish to do. They enjoy doing
experiments on humans, implanting them and so forth, for their
agenda and purposes, with the full cooperation of the human if
possible.
When the human is not cooperative, they generally will either leave
the entity alone, if it is early enough and the entity has not been
already put into a state which they can control safely, or they may
attempt to fix some kind of disabling controls on the entity so they
do not have to fear the entity. They do not like confronting a human
who is outraged for fear the human could hurt them. They are not
strong as are the Reptoids.
The Reptoids are approximately four times as strong as the average
human. They would have strength compared to a large gorilla or ape,
or a very strong muscleman. In some cases, even stronger than a
strong muscleman. This Awareness indicates that the average Reptoid
being approximately 7 feet tall, in some cases taller, and having
enough strength to easily lift 500 pounds, or more.
This Awareness indicates the two movies Predator 1 and 2 give
relatively accurate portrayals of the Reptoid types, though the
cloaking device used in the movies, giving the Predator invisibility
is not seen as being so well available to the Reptoid aliens. This
Awareness indicates that they are not able to disappear as indicates
in the movies. They do, however, have the infrared vision indicated
in the movie versions.
This Awareness indicates it is seen as a possibility that with
certain alien technology they could effect a kind of cloaking device
to cause entities not to be able to see them. The effects would be
more on the order of bending light, similar to activities used in
the spacecraft in its ability to cloak its presence through bending
light.
There are also abilities to move into different frequencies
so that one could leave the frequency of the 49th octave and not be
seen by the eyes of entities whose vision is limited to that octave,
but in moving out of that frequency, they would also lose the
ability to function in the frequency of the third dimension.
This Awareness indicates that these would be special types of
technology which are generally not used by these Reptoids; that it
could be used in certain instances, but generally, the Reptoids that
have appeared on Earth are not equipped with these technologies, at
this time.
This Awareness indicates the Zeta Reticuli do have
certain technical devices they can wear on their backs, to move
through different frequency levels or in and out of the 49th octave,
so that they could cloak themselves with invisibility.
They do on occasion use these for entering into homes for purposes
of abductions, when they do not wish to be seen, or when they wish
to walk through walls or ceilings. This Awareness does not wish to
cause entities paranoia.
Your chance of being visited by these
little Greys is very slim, especially if you are into metaphysics,
have a relatively intelligent mind and are not likely to be taken by
these entities. If you have a tendency to worship these little
fellows, you might become a candidate for such a visitation. That
would be to your detriment.
Question: These Reptoids that go out conquering planets; they don't
return to their home base and have a family unit, like the male
returns and says: "Honey, I'm back!" or something to that effect, do
they?
A:
This Awareness indicates this may occur on occasion. As often as
not, the family accompanies the warrior upon a planetoid and the
warrior might return to the planetoid on which the family is
waiting, as in the case of the Nemesis or the crafts which accompany
Nemesis, the small moon-like planetoid.
This Awareness indicates
that this would normally be for those with rank, to be allowed to
bring their families with them; that the Reptoids having very little
social standing would not be allowed to bring their family with
them, but they might have other mates or might mate with others.
Generally, if a Reptoid has a family, he is given the choice of
whether to be sent on a mission to a distant planet or to stay at
home and serve on his home planet. They do not like to create
dissention or situations which might lead to rebellion among the
troops. It is not out of compassion, but out of practicality and
experience that this policy was developed.
Question: The Reptoid stands erect more less on two feet rather than
having more than two feet, like some lizards, does it not?
A:
This is in the affirmative.
Question: Is its physical appearance remotely or similar to the
illustration Jon Strongbow did for us that we put out in one of the
readings?
A:
This Awareness indicates this as negative; that the Reptoid tends to
look more human, but rather than skin, the features are scaly with
the facial features a smoother scale-like skin, similar to that of
the underbelly of a fish or a snake. It is somewhat softer and in a
kind of grid-like appearance may exhibit itself on the features. The
neck also is very tender in appearance; although the scales are
there, they are very small, and like the underbelly of a snake.
The features wherein the scales are more strong are on the back of
the head, top of the head and down the back; also on the arms where
the skin is thicker on humans, the scales are thicker on Reptoids.
Where the skin is tender on humans it tends to be tender on Reptoids
also, with scales being much finer in appearance.
The mouth and
nose, the upper lip and the nose tend to come together rather than
as a protrusion in the manner of the human nose; the nose being part
of the face jutting out with the mouth appearing much like that of a
snake, more so than that of the alligator or crocodile type. This is
not the effect associated with the Reptoid features.
They are not terribly ugly except for the scales. Their features are
closer to that of humans than any other reptoid or reptile, but they
have these scales on them.
Question: They do have sex organs sort of similar to humans, do they
not?
A:
This is in the affirmative.
This Awareness indicates that they do
not have a strong desire to mate with humans in the physical sense,
but they do create half-breeds through laboratory projects using the
human eggs mixed with Reptoid semen to create test-tube alien
offspring, or in some cases using human semen with Reptoid eggs; the
creation of half-breed being for future use in planned war with the
Pleiadians wherein these entities would pilot their ships in a war
with Pleiadian or Sirius or Arcturus ships working in behalf of the
Confederation in order to prevent these forces from rescuing
humanity from the Reptoid grip.
Question: These creatures do not have a tail, do they?
A:
This Awareness indicates that in some cases the tail is present and
somewhat short. In other cases it is longer. This is much likened
unto signs of Reptilian virility, much the way there are hairy men
and men without hair. There are those Reptoids with short tails or
long tails or hardly any tail whatsoever.
The length of tail of
course is quite short in all cases, not likened unto tails of
animals. Possibly measurable in inches, but not in feet.
Question: During courtship, if that's the word, for the female, do
Reptilian males combat one another like animals do in our world?
Compete with one another?
A:
This Awareness indicates that this appears to be rare, but can occur
in instances especially wherein there are shortages of female mates.
This Awareness indicates the female, of course, does not give live
birth, as do mammals.
Question: Does the female lay on the eggs or hatch them out, or is
this done in laboratories, or how is that done?
A:
This Awareness indicates that they tend to place these eggs in a
kind of incubation setting wherein they are kept warm without the
female needing to be in attendance. There is no real bonding between
the mother and the offspring in the Reptoid cultures.
The
half-breeds, because of their human genes, tend to need bonding with
a parent or otherwise they become weak and have little interest in
survival, and there is a high mortality rate among half-breeds who
do not form any bonding with parents or other beings.
Question: While on this subject, a couple of questions from H and
N.M., who both play in a symphony orchestra, and these questions are
about the Greys, but Awareness might indicate whether the same
applies to the Reptilians.
They write:
"Do the Greys have any art
forms at all? They sound like nerdy little scientists that do
nothing but practice genetic manipulation or planetary conquest all
the time. Do they ever have the need to relax or have recreation?"
A:
This Awareness indicates there was a case in which an entity had
voice contact with a Grey over a kind of screen device made from his
computer in which he asked the Grey: "What is your favorite musical
group?" The entity answered "New Kids on the Block".
This Awareness
indicates that this appears to be an indication that these entities
monitor your shows, your television and are to some degree at least,
absorbing some of your culture, and this Awareness suggests that
they are gradually becoming accustomed to your music forms and art
forms.
This Awareness indicates that they also have been known to dance,
although the dancing may not be very artistic. They do apparently
have some enjoyment in the dancing process. This Awareness indicates
that without emotions, it is very difficult to develop much
enjoyment for any art or music or other types of personal
expression, and therefore, these entities tend to be more into
cerebral activity than libido activities or emotional matters.
Question: This would also apply to the Reptoids?
A:
This Awareness indicates the Reptoids have more emotions than do the
Greys. The emotions being more basic in the sense of primal
emotions. They do understand rhythm and they do have some
appreciation for music. It is the rhythm in the music and the
vibrations that they enjoy most. They care little for the words or
poetry expressed through music, such as from songs or humans wailing
while music plays.
They are not impressed by singers who shout and groan and growl to
hard rock type music. They are more inclined toward mellower tones.
This Awareness reminds you that serpents in India can be hypnotized
by flutes and these Reptoids have also certain amounts of hearing
that allows them some appreciation for hypnotic music.
Question: Their next question is rather redundant. I'll ask it. "Do
they have any respect at all for our artists and our art forms?
Surely watching a great pianist or violinist or trombonist would
amaze them. Do they possess the physical dexterity to even do a poor
imitation?"
A:
This Awareness indicates the Zeta Reticuli in watching a pianist
would liken the entity to one who was really fast on a computer, and
would see that the entity's dexterity was notable. As far as the
music is concerned, they would be able to recognize he was creating
tones of different frequencies and their interest might be as to
what these frequencies mean, whether there was a code involved or a
message being relayed.
They would not particularly experience the
emotional aspects of the music. This Awareness indicates that in
reference to the Reptoids listening to such music, this would be
more awesome to them, although they might not want to admit their
admiration for the action.
This might be for them comparable to your
watching a hummingbird as it flutters its wings without moving, and
you might wonder how it could move its wings so fast and yet not go
anywhere. They may look at this with some awe as to how humans can
do that.
This Awareness indicates that they might even enjoy the music,
depending on whether it touched something in them or whether it
annoyed their nervous system.
This Awareness indicates the nature of
music is that in the arrangement of the musical scale there are
certain spaces between notes that are uneven wherein some notes lead
evenly, one to another in the scale, and others are uneven, further
apart, or closer together, and when these notes are further apart,
there is the feeling of a great reaching, and when the notes are
closer together, such as a half-step, the notes move easily from one
to another, so those notes that move easily create a feeling of
rest, of comfort and those notes which are far apart, such as the
one and a half steps, are more difficult and create a feeling of
struggle.
Thus, the ease or the struggle in its placement in the scale
indicates some notes that pull on the entity's emotions as they
reach far or hard to the next note, and other notes that are closer
together indicate in the emotions of the human, a feeling of: "Ahah!
At last! A place of rest!"
The half-step leads easily and naturally
to its next note, and the note which is one and a half steps is a
reaching note that pulls on the emotions and gives the feeling of
difficulty or struggle, and these stir the emotions in the human.
When you struggle to reach the next note, or you find a feeling of
ease and peace in leading to the half-step, a resolving as you reach
the next level, you experience emotions, and the artist who can
arrange these emotional pulls and releases controls the human's
emotions.
This Awareness indicate but before any of this can happen,
the human must be able to sense the steps of the scale that is being
used, whether it is a major or a minor scale. This Awareness
indicates that in this sense, the Reptoid shares something with the
human.
The cerebral oriented Grey only thinks of these things in terms of
what the notes are doing, whether they have some special
communicative purpose and what code might be being expressed in
these varying frequencies.
They may, at some point discover there is
no code and there is no particular purpose in the notes being moved
from one place to another. Then they might begin to recognize just a
pattern arbitrarily created by someone, doing something that humans
enjoy, and conclude that humans enjoy patterns of frequencies, but
they themselves may not participate in the struggle of the notes or
the resolving of a melody.
This Awareness indicate in other words, the Zeta Reticuli do not
feel music to the degree that humans feel it. The Reptoids feel it
more than the Greys. The Reptoids would recognize rhythms and
certain pitches and frequencies with more appreciation than would
the Greys.
The Reptoid still would not appreciate music in the way
humans appreciate it.
Question: Awareness just answered their last question, but I'll read
it, for one reason here...
"I wonder if they measure or notice the
tremendous uplifting spiritual vibes that occur at a wonderful
symphony or a chamber music concert, or they simply just observe?"
It was the spiritual vibes I wanted to ask about. Do they get
anything at all of a spiritual feeling from music?
A:
This Awareness indicates that they are not likely to get goose-bumps
or thrill that entities experience from the high mana released from
the beautiful music that humans often enjoy as spiritually
uplifting.
This Awareness indicates the Greys would tend to classify
music as a kind of vibrational science, similar to mathematics that
humans use for entertainment. They would not tend to understand
through experiential levels, the value of music to humans.
The
Reptoids would tend to understand it as a kind of emotional
stimulus for humans. They would understand the emotion that the
music influences, but they would not particularly be influenced in
the same degree as humans.
