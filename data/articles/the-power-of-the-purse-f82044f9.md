Throughout human history the control and manipulation of money has been used
by the elites to control free humanity. This has continued up until this
day.
A film by
Lee Rogers, 'Power of the Purse' details the history of how money has evolved from
ancient times to the 21st century. This film exposes how those who have
controlled money have used this power to fund both sides of wars in order to
bankrupt nations and peoples.
The film reveals important historical facts
and information about the modern day monetary system that the
corporate
media and the teachers indoctrinating our youth in the so-called
public
education (indoctrination) system refuse to talk about.
This video explores the following
topics and much more:
-
The
Knights Templar's International Banking System.
-
The Rise of
the Rothschild's European Banking Empire.
-
How
the Federal
Reserve and other Central Banks create money out of thin air to drive
nations and peoples into debt.
-
How both sides of major wars and conflicts
have been funded and engineered by powerful banking interests.
-
The lies
surrounding the official story of the
September 11th, 2001 attacks and how
it has been used to justify endless war.
-
How the manipulation of the value
of money has been used to create
economic depressions
