# Chapter 6 - Use of Electgronics

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/mindcontrol/Chapter06.htm

Another basic component of the Monarch program is lots of electro shock.
Stun guns, staffs with hidden electric cattle prods, and cattle prods
are frequently used on the slaves. Electroshock is used to create the
dissociation from trauma during the programming, and later it is used to
remove memories after the slave has carried out a mission, or to instill
fear and obedience in a reluctant slave. Slaves generally carry horrible
body memories of excruciating electro-shock tortures to their entire
bodies. As the slaves begin a therapeutic deprogramming process they
will recover these horrible memories, not to mention many other painful
memories.
A slave often shows electro-shock marks on their feet, or
back, or buttock or legs after they have been used. An owner of a slave
will ordinarily carry a stun gun. This is perhaps a 120,000 DC volt stun
gun to erase & compartmentalize memories, but some of the stun guns go
up to 200,000 volts DC to erase the memory of his slave. They will apply
their stun guns to the base of the skull. After giving programming
instructions they will usually give a high voltage shock to the base of
the skull to imbed the instructions deep in the subconscious. They often
use hypnotic cues along with the shock. For instance, they will tell the
slave they are now going over the rainbow, and that when the sun goes
down they will forget everything, before they shock the body.
The shock
destroys and scrambles the memory which is still stored in the short
term memory section of the brain. They must shock the person within 24
hours, to insure that the short term memory doesnt get into long term
memory as a coherent memory. This means that if a slave is being used
daily, they get electroshocked daily. Types of devices used by handlers:
A cylindrical type cattle prod with 3/4 between the contact points is
used externally and internally. This is manufactured by Hot Shot
Products, Inc., Savage, MN 55378. Model B-12. They have a red or
black rubber handle with an overall length of 12. The low voltage is
between 10,000-15,000 volts. The medium voltage is 12,000 to 20,000
volts. A bruise on the buttocks will be black and blue spots about 1
1/2 diameter each. A hand held wand type shock prod which has 2 3/4
between its contact points. It uses a rechargeable battery pack. The
prod (wand) is 2 1/2 long, and unwieldy to handle.
Various farm supply
companies (livestock equipment) sell this. The medium voltage is 12,000
to 20,000. A stun gun which has exactly 2 between the contacts with a 9
volt battery. This stun gun was created for law enforcement, and is
generally regarded as the best device for dropping a victim or for
inducing hypnosis, or setting in a hypnotic program. Its high voltage is
35,000 to 120,000 volts. It is a light weight (12 oz.), compact device,
7 x 2 x 1. This device will leave deep red dot (holes) scars and
cancerous moles. The victim will develop moles from the repeated use of
this device. The muscled areas of the victim are preferred. For
instance, the muscled area just below the shoulder blade. Farrall
Instrument Co., of Grand Island, NE makes a cattle prod with an
adjustable voltage control.
Their long distance wireless shocker called
Personal Shocker can shoot a shock about 75 indoors and 300 feet
outdoors. The control box is hand held, and the receiver is a leather
case. The shock can be adjusted from 9 to 800 volts, current is 5 milliamperes, and it lasts 1 to 2 milliseconds. This Personal Shocker
was manufactured to be used on people. An electronic firm in Tujunga, CA
makes a shock box used in programming. An electronic bark collar is used
to train Illuminati & other Monarch slaves in silence & obedience. On
other occasions, fancy gem studded collars and leather collars are
fitted around the necks of female slaves for sex with wolves and fierce
dogs, who bite these neck-collars when they mount. Many of the slaves
have experienced these various collars for obedience, silence, &
bestiality. In trying to track down who makes the larger electro-shock
machines, especially the computer guided ones, we only got started
investigating.
Con-med (315-797-8375) makes medical electrodes for
portable monitoring units. Sentry Medical Products, at 17171 Murphy,
Irvine, CA 92714 (714-250-0233) makes Skin Mounted Conductive Medical
Electrodes for Tense Unit Machines. In Vivo Metric, in Healdsburg, CA
also makes silver Chloride electrodes for placement on human skin.
Electro-Cap Inter, produces BEG placement systems. Uni-Patch Medical
Products, 13 13-T Grant Blvd. W, Wabasha, MN makes all types of
Electrodes and some of theirs go onto machines for shocking people.
Classic Medical Products, 582-T W 19246 Apollo Dr., Muskego, WI make
electrodes for diagnostic and shock purposes. Arndt Automation & Assoc.,
Inc., 17770 Liberty Lane, New Berlin, WI, make electrodes for ECG and
EKG machines. And a Colorado company named Biomedical at Evergreen, CO
makes medical electrodes.
When a slave is taken to an impromptu
programming site--a hypnotic drug is injected into them for a quick
induction while a metal band is put around their head and a current of
100,000 volts will be run through for say 5 seconds into their heads.
This will cause the body to shake, the eyes to close, sweat to pour out
of the body etc. The hands are tied down with restraints. Sometimes the
mouth is gagged so that the tongue doesnt protrude. After imbedding the
hypnotic commands deep into the mind, the programmers might adjust the
automatic timer on the equipment and give the victim another blast of
voltage for 10 seconds. The persons body will shake and quiver for a
while after this.
They may dribble spit. Finally, the person will be
brought out of their hypnotic trance, instructed not to remember
anything, to feel happy and sent on their way. This entire programming
session can last 15 minutes. Programming sites like this can be the back
of a van, a back room in a restaurant, or any other place that the
equipment can be set up at. This is why a slave, who has been used
recently, may hobble a little, or when they get memories feel a tight
headband around their head along with awful headaches & flashes of
light.
The memory will feel like a robotic
state to the slave. Here is a drawing that one slave made of the
electric headband used to program an alter.
The slave handler will also carry a
black or grey spiral book with all their own slaves access codes,
triggers, cryptic keys and programs. All this will fit into a brief
case. A working knowledge of hypnosis is helpful to understand how to
deal with the slave in certain instances. Because the slave is under the
most powerful combinations of mind-control and is so divided against his
or her own self, it is almost impossible to have many problems with the
slave if the handler does what he is supposed to do. However, some
handlers get drunk or loan the slave to inexperienced people, etc. and
problems do develop.
Of course the slaves always end up taking the blame
for everything that goes wrong. If the slave gets out of hand, because
the handler doesnt know what he is doing, a stun gun comes in handy to
control the mismanaged slave. In other words, a brief case with the
programming book and stun gun are basically all that is needed to
control a Monarch slave for the rest of his or her life. Some of these
stun guns are only a few inches long and look like boxes. Other stun
guns are imbedded in staffs. The canes and the staffs that Satanists
carry around, like Michael Aquino (in public in fact) are actually stun
guns to control their slaves.
The Queen Mothers staff of the Illuminati
has an electric stun gun hidden in it. Children in day care centers are
reporting small boxes with wires that electroshock them during
programming. An example is given in Vol. 1, of how the Illuminati
bloodlines connect to research about electric shocks to control people.
For example, David V. Reynolds research, who wrote,
Neuroelectric
Research: Electroneuroprosthesis, Electroanesthesia, and Nonconvulsive
Electrotherapy.
Another way of using electricity for torture is to use
directed energy (a new technology) on mens genitals. With skillful use
of directed energy they can simulate a rape of a man or woman.
Artificial sodomy via directed energy was first tested in male prisons.
ELF waves will place thoughts into the mens mind as the directed energy
make them feel sodomized.
MICROWAVES FOR PROGRAMMING
On Aug. 22, 1989, Phillip L. Stoklin,
P.O. Box 2111, Satellite Beach, FL took out a patent --which is Patent
Number 4,858,612 which is a device that can be placed in the auditory
cortex of the brain. This device allows the following process: someone
speaks into a microphone, the microphone then has its sounds coded into
microwave, which are sent to the receiver in the brain and the receiver
device will transform the microwaves back so that the persons mind
hears the original sounds. In other words, a person with this device in
their head will hear whatever the programmers send via microwave
signals.
Various types of non-lethal weapons
have been created and are now being used. Directed-energy can be used to
sculpt clouds.
ELF waves can be used to place thoughts in peoples minds
without using implants. In 1991, a paper trail began to appear when the
CIA connected U.S. government Global Strategy Council came out with a
paper entitled, Nonlethality: Development of a National Policy and
Employing Nonlethal Means in a New Strategic Era. Their paper was
prepared by Janet Morris. The USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks
Air Force Base, TX put out a report USAFAM-TR-87-30 entitled Behavioral
response of rats exposed to high-power microwave radiation.
High-power,ultra-short pulse-width emitters of microwaves were used to
alter the thinking in rats. The report refers to two other reports: one
by T. Wheeler, et. al. Retrograde Amnesia in Rats Produced by Electron
Beam Exposure, entitled USAFAM-TR-83-3, Feb. 83. The other report is
by R. Bermant, Classical conditioning of Microwave-Induced Hyperthermia
in Rats. Radio Sci. 14 (6S): 201-207, 1979. This is a clear paper
trail, that military research has gone on to control the brain via
microwaves.
Another institution in Texas, the Texas
Dept. of Criminal Justice TDCJ-ID, has been putting high-tech listening
implants into the ear canal behind the ear drum which lets them monitor
what the ear is hearing--a great way to spy. This is according to an
implant victim who with medical help discovered his implant. The Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) discovered that pulsed microwave
audiograms also called analogs of the sounds of spoken words, could be
transmitted to a target, and the effect on victim would be to hear
voices in their head. The next 11 pages are patent no. 4,858,612. After
this, we'll reveal the numerous mind-control capabilities of
ELF-microwave tech.) »
The next pages, page
169 to page 174, may present the reader with some minor difficulties in
reading, because with some words it was not possible to process them,
because of poor printing. So some words are lost, and this can make
certain sentences appear strange. Webmaster: because I edited the text
the reading is normal now. It maybe so however that some words are

HEARING DEVICE
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1.
Field at the Invention
This invention relates to devices for aiding at hearing in mammals. The
invention is based upon the perception at sounds which is experienced in
the brain when the brain is subjected to certain microwave
radiation signals.
2.
Description of the Prior Art
In prior art hearing devices for human
beings, it is well known to amplify sounds to be heard and to apply the
amplified sound signal to the ear at the person wearing the hearing aid. Hearing devices of this type are
however limited to hearing dysfunctions where there is no damage to the
auditory nerve or to the auditory cortex. In the prior art, if there is
damage to the auditory cortex or the auditory nerve, it cannot be
corrected by the use of a hearing aid.
During World War II, individuals in the
radiation path of certain radar installations observed clicks and
buzzing sounds in response to the microwave radiation. It was through
this early observation that it became known to the art that microwaves
could cause a direct perception at sound within a human brain. These
buzzing or clicking sounds however were not meaningful and were not
perception of sounds which could other-wise be heard by the receiver.
This type of microwave radiation was not representative of any
intelligible sound to be perceived.
In such radar installations, there
was never a sound which was generated which resulted in subsequent
generation of microwave signals representative of that sound. Since the
early perception of buzzing and clicking. further research has been
conducted into the micro-wave reaction of the brain. In an article
entitled Possible Microwave Mechanisms of the Mammalian Nervous System
by Philip L Stocklin and Brain F. Stocklin, published in the TIT
Journal of Life Sciences. Tower International Technomedical Institute.
Inc. P.O. Box 4594, Philadelphia. Pa. (1979) there is disclosed a
hypothesis that the mammalian brain generates and uses electra magnetic
waves in the lower microwave fre-quency region as an integral part of
the functioning of the central and peripheral nervous systems.
This analysis is based primarily upon the potential energy of a protein
integral in the neural membrane. In an article by W. Bise entitled Low
Power Radio-Frequency and Microwave Effects On Human Electro-
encephalogram and Behavior, Physiol. Chemistry Phys. 10. 387 (1978), it
is reported that there are significant effects upon the alert human EEG
during radiation by low intensity cw microwave electromagnetic energy.
Bise observed significant repeatable EEG effects tar a subject during
radiation at specific microwave frequencies.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Results at theoretical analysis of the physics of brain tissue and the
brain/skull cavity, combined with experimentally-determined
electromagnetic properties at mammalian brain tissue, indicate the
physical necessity for the existence of electromagnetic standing waves.
called modes in the living mammalian brain. The made characteristics may be determined by two geometric properties at the brain: these are
the cephalic index at the brain (its shape in prolate spheroidal
coordinates) and the semifocal distance of the brain (a measure of its
size). It was concluded that estimation ot brain cephalic index and
semifocal distance using external skull measurements on subjects
permits estimation of the subjects characteristic mode frequencies,
which in turn will permit a mode by mode treatment at the data to
simulate hearing.
This invention provides for sound perception by individuals who have
impaired hearing resulting tram ear damage, auditory nerve damage, and
damage to the auditory cortex. This invention provides for simulation of
microwave radiation which is normally produced by the auditory cortex.
The simulated brain waves are introduced into the region at the auditory
cortex and provide for perceived sounds on the part at the subject.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT (for the figures
referred to further down the article, see the pictures above)
This invention is based upon observations at the physical mechanism the
mammalian brain uses to perceive acoustic vibrations. This observation
is based in part upon neuro anatomical and other experimental evidence
which relates to microwave brain stimulation and the perception of
sounds. It is has been observed that monochromatic acoustic stimuli
(acoustic tones, or single tones) of different frequencies uniquely
stimulate different regions at the cochlea. It has also been observed
that there is a corresponding one to one relationship between the
frequency of a monochromatic acoustic stimulus and the region of the
auditory cortex neurally stimulated by the cochlear nerve under the
physiologically normal conditions tonotopicity).
It has been observed
that for an acoustic tone of a frequency which is at the lower end at
the entire acoustical range perceivable by a person, that thin lateral
region ("Line") parallel to the medial axis of the brain and toward the infenor portion of the primary auditory cortex is stimulated. For an
acoustic tone whose frequency is toward the high end of the entire
perceivable acoustic range, a thin lateral region parallel to the medial
axis and toward the superior portion at the primary auditory cortex is
stimulated. Neural stimulation results in the generation at a broad band
of microwave photons by the change in rotational energy state of protons
integral to the neuron membrane of the auditory cortex. The physical
size and shape of the brain/skull cavity, together with the
(semi-conductor) properties (conductivity and dielectric constant) of
the brain tissue provide an electromagnetic resonant cavity.
Specific single frequencies are constructively reinforced so that a number of
standing electromagnetic waves, each at its own single electro-magnetic
frequency in the microwave frequency region. are generated in the brain.
Each such standing electromagnetic wave is called a characteristic mode
of the brain/skull cavity. Analysis in terms of prolate spheroidal wave
functions indicates that transverse electric field components of these
modes have maxima in the region of the auditory cortex. This analysis
further shows that transverse electric field possess a variation of
amplitude with angle in the angular plane (along the vertical dimension
of the auditory cortex) and that is dependent only upon the primary mode
number. The auditory cortex in the normally functioning mammalian brain
is a source of microwave modes. The auditory cortex generates these
modes in accordance with the neural stimulation of the auditory cortex
by the cochlear nerve.
Mode weighting for any one acoustic tone stimulus
is given by the amplitude of each mode along the line region of the
auditory cortex which is neurally stimulated by that acoustic tone
stimulus. A listing of mode weighting versus frequency of acoustic
stimulus is called the mode matrix. In this invention, the functions of
the ear, the cochlear nerve, and the auditory cortex are simulated. Microwaves simulating the mode matrix are inserted directly into the
region of the auditory cortex. By this insertion of simulated microwave
modes, the normal operation of the entire natural hearing mechanism is
simulated. Referring now to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 there is shown an
apparattus which provides for induced perception of sound into a
mammalian brain.
This bearing device includes a microphone 10 which
receives sounds, an acoustic filter bank 12 which separates the signals
from the microphone into component frequencies, and a mode control
matrix 14 which generates the mode signals which are used to control
the intensity of micro-wave radiations which are injected into the skull
cavity in the region of the auditory cortex. The acoustic filterbank 12
consists of a bank of acoustic filters Fl through Fk which span the
audible acoustic spectrum. These filters may be built from stan-dard
resistance, inductance, and capacitance components in accordance with
well established practice. In the preferred embodiment there are 24
filters which 63 correspond to the observed critical bandwidths of the
human ear. In this preferred embodiment a typical, list at filter
parameters is given by Table I to the right.
Unfortunately the writing
is not very clear:
The rectifier outputs one through K are feed to K mode partition
devices. The mode partitioning devices each have N outputs wherein N is
the number of micro-wave oscillators used to generate the microwave
radiation. The outputs 1 through N of each mode partition device is
applied respectively to the inputs of each gain controlled amplifier of
the microwave radiation generator. The function of the mode control
matrix 14 is the control of the microwave amplifiers in the microwave
amplifier bank 18. In the preferred embodiment thus will be 24 outputs
and 24 microwave frequency oscillators.
Connected to each microwave amplifier gain control line is a mode
simulation device 16 which receives weighted mode signals from the mode
partition devices 14. Each mode simulation device consists of one
through k lines and diodes 17 which are each connected to summing
junction 19. The diodes 17 provide for isolation from one mode partition
device to the next. The diodes 17 prevent signals from one mode
partition device from returning to the other mode partition de-vices
which are also connected to the same summing junction of the mode
summation device 16. The diodes also serve a second function which is
the rectification of the signals received from the acoustic filter bank
by way of the mode partition devices. In this way each mode partition
device output is rectified to produce a varying DC voltage with major
frequency components of the order of 15 milliseconds or less. The
voltage at the summation junction 19 is thus a slowly varying DC
voltage. The example mode partition devices are shown in greater detail
in FIGS. 3. 4, and 5.
The mode partition devices are merely resistance
networks which produce 1 through N output voltages which are
predetermined divisions of the input original from the acoustic filter
associated with the mode partition device. FIG. 3 shows a mode
partitioning device wherein several outputs are associated with each
series resistor 30. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 4 there is an
output associated with each series resistor only, and thus there are N
series resistors, or the same number of series resistors as there are
outputs. The values of the resistors in the mode partition resistor
network are determined in accordance with the magnitudes of the
frequency component from the acoustic filter bank 12 which is required
at the summation point 19 or the gain control line for amplifiers 20.
The microwave amplifier bank 18 Consists of: plurality of microwave
oscillators 1 through N each of which is connected to an amplifier 20.
Since the amplifiers 20 are gain controlled by the signals at summation
junction 19. the magnitude of the microwave output is con-trolled by
the mode control matrix outputs Fl through F. In the preferred
embodiment there are 24 amplifiers.
The leads from the microwave
oscillators I through N to the amplifiers 20 are shielded to prevent
cross talk from one oscillator to the next, and to prevent stray signals
from reaching the user of the hearing device. The output impedance of
amplifiers 20 should be 1000 ohms and this is indicated by resistor 21.
The outputs of amplifiers 20 are all connected to a summing junction 22.
The summing junction 22 is connected to a summing impedance 23 which is
approximately 50 ohms. The relatively high amplifier output impedance 21
as com-pared to the relatively low summing impedance 23 provides
minimization of cross talk between the amplifiers. Since the amplitude
of the microwave signal needed at the antenna 24 is relatively small,
there is no need to match the antenna and summing junction impedances to
the amplifier 20 output impedances.
Efficiency of the amplifiers 20 is
not critical. Level control of the signal at antenna 24 is controlled by
pick off 25 which is connected to the summing impedance 23. In this
manner the signal at antenna 24 can be varied from 0 (ground) to a value
which is acceptable to the individual. The antenna 24 is placed next to
the subjects head and in the region of the subjects auditory cortex 26.
By placement of the antenna 24 in the region of the auditory cortex 26.
the microwave field which is generated simulates the microwave field
which would be generated if the acoustic sounds were perceived with
normal hearing and the auditory cortex was functioning normally. In FIG.
2A there is shown a second embodiment of the microwave radiation and
generator portion of the hearing device. In this embodiment a broad band
micro-wave source 50 generates microwave signals which are feed to
filters 52 through 58 which select from the broad band radiation
particular frequencies to be transmitted to the person. As in FIG. 2.
the amplifiers 20 receive signals on lines 19 from the mode control
matrix.
The signals on lines 19 provide the gain control for amplifiers 20. In
FIG. 6 there is shown a modified microwave hearing generator 60
which includes a mode partition resistor divider network as depicted in
FIG. 5. Each of the mode partition voltage divider networks in this
embodiment are individually adjustable for all of the resistances in
the resistance network FIG. 5 depicts a voltage division system wherein
adjustment of the voltage partition resistors is provided for. In FIG.
6, the sound source 62 generates audible sounds which are received by
the microphone of the microwave hearing generator 60. In accordance with
the operation described with respect to FIGS, 1 and 2. microwave signals
are generated at the antenna 10 in accordance with the redistribution
provided by the mode control matrix as set forth in FIG. 5.
The sound
source 62 also produces a signal on line 6-4 which is received by a head
phone 66. The apparatus depicted in FIG 6 is used to calibrate or fit a
micro-wave hearing generator to a particular individual. Once the
hearing generator is adjusted to the particular individual by adjustment
of the variable resistors in the adjustable mode partition portion of
the hearing generator. A second generator may be built using fixed value
resistors in accordance with the adjusted values achieved in fitting the
device to the particular subject The sound produced by headphone 66
should he the same as a sound from the sound source 62 which is
received by the microphone 10 in the microwave hearing
generator 60. In this way, the subject can make comparisons between the
perceived sound from the hearing generator 60. and the sound which is
heard from headphone 66. Sound source 62 also produces a signal on 68
which is feed in cue light 69. Cualight 69 comes on whenever a sound is
emitted from sound source 62 to the microwave generator 60.

OMITTED, TEXT NOT READABLE)
In
Fig. 7 there is shown a modified microwave generator which may be used
to determine a subject's microwave mode frequencies. In this device the
acoustic filter bank and the mode control matrix have been removed and
replaced by voltage level signals generated by potentiometers 70. Also
included are a plurality of variable frequency oscillators 72 which feed
microwave amplifiers 74 which are gain controlled from the signal
generated by potentiometers 70 and pick off arm 76. This modified
microwave hearing generator is used to provide signals using one
oscillator at a time. When an oscillator is turned on. the frequency is
varied about the estimated value until a maximum acoustic perception by
the subject is perceived. This perception however may consist of a
buzzing or hissing sound tat rather than a tone because only one
microwave frequencies being received. The first test of perception is to
determine the subjects lowest modal frequency for audibility. (M= 1).
Once this modal frequency is obtained. The process is repeated for
several higher modal frequencies and continued until no maximum acoustic
perception occurs. Another method of determination of a subjects modal
frequencies is through anatomical estimation. This procedure is by
measurement of the subjects cephalic index and the lateral dimensions
of the skull. In this method, the shape is determined in prolate
spheroidal coordinance. Purely anatomical estimation of subjects modal
frequencies is performed by first measuring the maximum lateral
dimension (breadth) L FIG. 1, of the subjects head together with the
maximum dimension D (anterior to Posterior) in the medial plane of the
subjects head. D is the distance along Z axis as shown in FIG. 10. The
ratio L/D, called in anthropology the cephalic index, is monotonically
related to the boundary value E0 defining the ellipsoidal surface
approximating the interface between the brain and the skull in the
prolate spheroidal coordinate system.
E0 defines the shape of this
interface; E0 and D together give an estimate of a, the semi-focal
distance of the defining ellipsoid. Using E0 and a, together with known
values of the conductivity and dielectric constants of brain tissue,
those wavelengths are found for which the radial component of the
electric field satisfies the boundary condition that it is zero at E0.
These wavelengths are the wavelengths associated with the standing
waves or modes. The corresponding frequencies are found by dividing the
phase velocity of microwaves in brain tissue by each of the wavelengths
A subjects microwave modal frequencies may also be determined by
observing the effect of external micro-wave radiation upon the EEG. The
frequency of the M equal I mode may then be used as a base point to estimate all other modal frequencies. A typical example of such an
estimation is where the subject is laterally irradiated with a
monochromatic microwave field simultaneous with EEG measurement and the
microwave frequency altered until a significant change occurs in the
EEG, the lowest such frequency causing a significant EEG change is
found.
This is identified as the frequency of the M= 1 mode, the lowest
mode of importance in auditory perception. The purely anatomical
estimation procedure (FIGS. 8, 9, 10) is then performed and the ratio of
each modal frequency to the M 1 modal frequency obtained. These ratios
together with the experimentally-determined M - I frequency are then
used to estimate the frequencies of the mode numbers higher than 1. The
prolate spheroidal coordinate system is shown in FIG. 9. Along the
lateral plane containing the x and y coordinates of FIG. 9. the pro-late
spheroidal coordinate variable 4 (angle) lies
FIGS. 9 and 10. Plots of the transverse electric field amplitude versus
primary mode number m are shown in FIG. 11. The equation is:
The
elevation view FIG. 12, of the brain from the left side, shows the
primary auditory cortex 10. The isotone lines and the high frequency
region are toward the top of 100 and the low frequency region toward the
bottom of 100.
The formula I, set forth below is the formula for combining modes from
an iso-tone line at ø= øj being excited to obtain the total modal field
at some other angular location ø. For this formula, if we let J= 1 (just
one iso-tone single frequency acoustic stimulus line), then it can be
shown that ALL modes (in general) must be used for any ONE tone.
FIG. 13 shows the resulting total modal field versus angle ø for source
location ø at 5.25°, 12.5°, etc. With reference to the set of curves at
the left top of this fig-ure. A spacing of approximately 7.25° in ø
corresponds to a tonal difference of about I octave. This conclusion is
based on the side-lobes of pattern coming from ø=5.25°, etc. The total
filed (value on y-axis) falls considerably below the top curves for
source locations well below 5.25° (toward the high acoustic stimulus
end) and also as the source of frequency goes well above 10° frequency
end) ø is plotted positive downward from the (at lateral location as
indicates in FIG I 11. Resistor weightings are obtained from the
(unreadable word) (m[ø -øj]). Formula I. The scale between acoustic
frequency and ø must be set or estimated from experiment. Approximately
5.25 ± 1° corresponds to a tonal stimulus at about 2 khz. (the most
sensitive region of the ear) since this source location gives tlte
highest electric field amplitude. The apparatus of FIG. 7 may also be
used to deter-mine values for a hearing device which are required for a
particular subject.
Once the modal frequencies have been estimated, the device of FIG. 7
which includes variable microwave oscillators may be used to deter-mine
values for the oscillators which match the subject. and to determine
resistance values associated with the mode partition devices of the mode
control matrix. In FIG. 7 manual control of the amplifier gain is
achieved by potentiometers 76. In this manner the amplifier gains are varied about the estimated settings
for an acoustic
tone stimulus in the region of two thousand Hertz (2 khz) until maximum
acoustic perception and a purest tone are achieved together. The term
purest tone may also be described as the most pleasing acoustic
perception by the subject. This process may be repeated at selected
.frequencies above and below 2 kHz.
The selected frequencies correspond
to regions of other acoustic filter center frequencies of the subject.
When modal frequency (oscillator frequency) and gain set values (setting
a potentiometer 76) are noted, it is then possible to calculate fixed
oscillator frequencies and control resistor values for the adjusted
hearing device for this particular subject. In the event the subject has
no prior acoustic experience, that is deaf from birth, estimated
resistor values must be used. Also, a complex acoustic stimulation test
including language articulation and pairs of harmonically related tones
may be developed to maximize the match of the hearing device parameters
for those of this particular subject. Typical components for use in this
invention include commercially available high fidelity microphones
which have a range of 50 Hz to 5 kHz with plus or minus 3 dB variation.
The audio filters to be used with the acoustic filter bank 12 are
constructed in a conventional manner, and have Q values of about 6. The
filters may also be de- signed with 3 dB down points (½ the bandwidth
away from the center frequency) occurring at adjacent center frequency
locations. The diodes 17 in the mode control matrix which provide
isolation between the mode partition circuits are commercially available
diodes in the audio range. The microwave oscillators I through N and the
microwave amplifiers 20 are constructed with available microwave
transistors which can be configured either as oscillators or amplifiers.
Examples of the transistors are GaAsFET field effect transistors by
Hewlett Packard known as the HFET series or silicone bipolar
transistors by Hewlett Packard known as the HXTR series. All the cable
between the oscillators, the microwave amplifiers, and the antenna
should be constructed with either single or double shielded coaxial
cable. The antenna 24 for directing microwave signals to the audio
cortex 26 should be approximately the size of the auditory cortex. A
typical size would be one and one half CM high and one half to one CM
wide.
The antenna as shown is located over the left auditory cortex.
but the right may also be used. Since the characteristic impedance of
the brain tissue at these microwave frequencies is close to 50 ohms,
efficient transmission by commercially available standard 30 ohm coax is
possible. The invention has been described in reference to the preferred

titled
"Hearing Device")
.............. In 1989, James C. Lin wrote Electromagnetic
Interaction With Biological Systems which deals with transmitting
ideas and words via electromagnetic waves. Brief cases, stereo speakers
and boxes are some of the disguises that the CIA has been caught using
to hide their ELF microwave emitters that plant thoughts in people. One
victim who spent time talking to Fritz Springmeier reported how they had
repeated tried to trick him into going to free hotel rooms and other
traps, where they tried to bombard his head with the idea that he should
sell drugs. He cleverly dismantled their devices which they hid in the
ceilings and other locations in these rooms to protect himself from the
thoughts they were trying repeatedly to beam into his head. He was on
the run as a fugitive to protect his mind. Naval Intelligence and other
groups have conducted research into ELF waves upon the human body and
mind. Some of the many things that can be done to the human body and
mind with ELF waves include:
a. put a person to sleep
b.
make a person tired or depressed c. create a feeling of fear in a person
d. create a zombie state
e.
create a violent state
f.
create a state of being sexually aggressive g. change cellular chemistry
h.
change hormone levels
i.
inhibit or enhance M (RNA) synthesis/processes
j.
control the DNA transaction process
k.
control biological spin and proton coupling constants in DNA, RNA & RNA
transferases.
Unfortunately for us humans, ELF waves can penetrate almost anything.
The U.S. Military has built a Ground-Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) all
over the U.S. with several hundred 300-500 GWEN towers that broadcast a
very-low-frequency wave (VLF) for mind-control of the American public. A
single GWEN tower can broadcast up to 300 miles in a 3600 circle. Plus 8
secret powerful
ELF transmitters have been established and 3 of them operate on the west
coast.
PROZAC AND SLAVES AND MICROWAVE TOWERS
Some of the Monarch slaves are receiving Prozac. Prozac (fluoxetine
hydrocloride-a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) is dangerous for everyone.
Prozac is now the second most used drug in the world. Three examples of
the ongoing nightmare now happening worldwide: September 14,
1989--Joseph Wesbecker on Prozac went crazy and got a gun and opened
fire in the Standard Gravure Building in Louisville killing eight and
wounding twelve others before killing himself. 20 suits against Eli
Lilly were filed by victim in this case. July, 1990--Rhonda Hala of
Shirley, NY filed a $150 million suit against Eli Lilly charging that
Prozac had driven her repeatedly to attempt suicide. August, 1990--CCHR
called on Congress to ban Prozac and 3 widows in Louisville, KT filed
$50 million lawsuits each, charging that a man on Prozac had been driven
insane to kill by the Prozac and had killed their husbands.
Two other
lawsuits were filed in this time period, one from Indianapolis, and one
from Chicago from people driven to attempt suicide by Prozac. Certain
brain activities trigger people on Prozac to become homicidal or
suicidal. Thanks to research by Illuminati controlled companies, the
Network knows exactly how to use ELF waves vectored on a particular
person by 3 separate towers to stimulate the Prozac controlled brain to
murder. This is being used to increase acts of anarchy and violence in
order to help insure anti-gun legislation. If a slave doesnt comply or
needs to be thrown from the Freedom Train they can become a useable
statistic. Simply trigger them to murder and then watch the police gun
them down. The NWO gains one more statistic and another case to scare
the public into accepting gun control.
THE USE OF WAVES & ELECTRICITY TO IMPLANT THOUGHTS
The programmers are always trying to outdo what theyve done before.
They are not satisfied with the old recipes for scrambled brains, they
keep inventing and refining new methods. Anything and everything within
their grasp has been tried. They have found that ELF and VLF
electro-magnetic waves can be used to control peoples thoughts.
Harmonics and sound waves are used to manipulate the RNA covering of
neuron pathways to the subconscious. Harmonic generators (code named
ether-wave) are able to imbed detailed commands which are linked to
audible triggers. This is one of the standard features of the Monarch
program. It allows the slaves to be controlled by trigger words which
make no sense or seem to carry no negative connotation to outside
listeners. For instance the words, Mr. Postman wait and see (a
Marionette command) might set off an access sequence so that a slave
living away from its master goes to its master (also called a handler).
The use of harmonics has taken away much of the work of the big
programmers. Now harmonic machines can implant the programming and codes
that the Programmers put in. Its quicker and perhaps more efficient,
although the lesser cult groups have to get by with the older methods.
And the Illuminati still have many excellent programmers in full-time
and part-time use. According to an eyewitness, their top-programmers are
far beyond their 1950-60 predecessors like Mengele. There are four types
of brain waves: alpha, beta, delta, and theta. The four basic models of
Monarch slaves have the same names as these four types of brain waves.
High level Illuminati models may have programming that includes all of
these types. According to one ex(?)-government source, the CIA has been
labeling their harmonic-created total Mind-controlled slaves by the
following:
-
Bravo 2 series models are men programmed to run the Beast computers.
-
Delta series are models for espionage and assassination.
-
Juliet series are sexual mind controlled slaves.
-
Kilo 5 series is military espionage.
-
Michael 1 series slaves are CIA agents under total mind-control.
-
Operation Greenstar was the Mind-control project to create UFO
abductions scenarios.
Much of the high level programming in the 1980s and 1990s is no longer
done with human programmers, but is done via programmed machines using
drugs, electricity and harmonics.
TRACKING / I.D. IMPLANTS
A
great deal has come out in a whole number of Christian books, as well as
secular books about the microchips that are being implanted in both
people and animals. These microchips will do many things, depending upon
which type of microchip they are, however, some of these microchips emit
coded signals which allow satellites with computers to track the exact
location of the person or animal carrying the chip. Obviously, a
Mind-controlled slave is not going to have the freedom to reject a chip
like this. This gives the owner a method for tracking the slave should
they ever escape to their exact location. Many of the slaves, CIA
agents, and military men have these implants already. Many Desert Shield
troops (to make sure they werent lost in the desert) were required to
get the tracking implants. Some countys are making it mandatory for
pets to get tracking implants.
MONITORING IMPLANTS
As
I write this, I have the report An eight channel micro powered PAM/FM
biomedical telemetry system written by the Space Biology Lab/Brain
Research Institute of the UCLA Center for Health Sciences, of Los
Angeles, California 90024. What they are reporting on is an implant
which will electronically report back what is going on with a persons
body to whoever is monitoring the person. Their biotelemeter consists
of a signal conditioner(s), multiplexer (for multichannel systems), and
a transmitter. The entire size of the implant is 6.35 cm. by 0.97
cm thick. EEG monitoring is being done of free-swimming divers by
implants. A frequency of 2300 Hz. was used on the first underwater
monitoring devices.
COMMUNICATION IMPLANTS
First, we will give an overview of the subject and then we will cover
the details of how the technology works. In the Bible it predicts that
in the end of church age that the rulers of the world These have one
mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast REV 17:13.
Robert Muller, a member of the Illuminati, and former Assistant
Secretary General of the UN, who has been involved in setting up a
Peace University in Costa Rica, said in a symposium Toward a Global
Brain, Our Next Evolutionary Step (Nov. 9-11, 1984, We are beginning
to link together to form one-world, minds and souls. Let go of our own
beliefs - crap stuff. We stand now at the threshold of the first
spiritualization of humanity. -
The goal of having a single World Mind
is being advocated by people tied to the Illuminati and the New Age
Movement they have created. In the New Age book Gods of Aquarius the
author advocates, The only viable solution is to link the brains of all
men into one giant super brain. It has been the entire species that have
been developing and it must be linked into one super being. A synthesis
of human minds in a world brain. Hollywood put out a movie in 1970
called Colossus-The Forbin Project which shows how the ultimate computer
will dominate the minds of men. Unfortunately, the Illuminati now have
the capability via their fronts to implant transmitters that will
communicate messages to the human brain that are received via computers.
The ability to literally have a single World Brain is within the grasp
of the elite. They must now simply figure out methods to accomplish it.
All this New Age talk by world leaders like Robert Muller about a single
World Mind is not hot air. Unfortunately, the technology is here
already. Will humanity stop the secret elite, or will humanity continue
to slide into deeper slavery?
CIA programmer/researcher Professor Delgado wrote in Physical Control
of the Mind in 1969 that, Brain transmitters can remain in a
persons head for life. The energy to activate the brain transmitter is
transmitted by way of radio frequencies. The radio frequencies used to
transmit to brain implants are usually from 15 to 35 KHz. Radio
frequency analyzing computers hooked up to computers have charted the
radio frequencies being used to transmit to victims with implants. (See
Mediaeko Investigating Reporting Group. Brain Transmitters What They
Are and How They Are Used. 1993, pg. 8.)
The use by handlers of
Frequency shift signals, which is a special way of modulating through a
given spectrum of frequencies, has been observed and recorded. Some of
the first brain transmitters looked like bullets and were placed into
the victims brain via the nose. In the late 1960s, some of the
transmitters were simply swallowed, or carried externally by the victim.
Small wires imbedded behind the ears are one of the implants. Sometimes
implants are placed within the pain/pleasure center of the brain, which
allows the handler to manipulate what feels great or what feels painful.
The Intelligence agencies have given their implants a whole variety of
names. Some of these names for brain implants are:
-
EDOM -- Electronic Dissolution of Memory
-
EEOM--Electronic Enhancement of Memory
-
ESB --Electronic Stimulation of the brain
-
RHIC -- Radio Hypnotic Intra-cerebral Control
Terms that accompany these techniques include:
-
PREMA--Personal Radio & Electro-Magnetic Frequency Allocation. This is
an individuals personal frequency which is scanned by a hand-held
device (such as a Reading Wand). PRIME FREAK--This is the Primary
Frequency of an individual, which the intelligence agencies will obtain
and then manipulate to control an individual.
-
VITAL HUMAN BRAIN FREQUENCY-- This is a frequency that is vital for
humans, (the 800 MHz band) which is manipulated for mass mind-control.
In 1978, Samuel Chavkin warned in his book The Mind Stealers With the increasing sophistication and miniaturization of electronics,
it may be possible to compress the necessary circuitry for a small
computer into a chip that is implantable subcutaneously. In this way,
the new self-contained instrument could be devised, capable of
receiving, analyzing and sending back information to the brain,
establishing artificial links between unrelated cerebral areas,
functional feedbacks, and programs of stimulations contingent on the
appearance of predetermined wave patterns.
Since Chavkin wrote this in
1978, the Network has come a long way on miniaturization and
sophistication of their implants. One of the most important end times
communications systems of the Illuminati and their intelligence agencies
is their ALEX system. This will operate on several levels. The
electronic end of the ALEX system which stands for Amalgamated
Logarithmic Encrypted Transmission (ALEX) is a method for encrypting
electronic transmissions so that a computer which could decode 5
Trillion codes a second would take 2,000 years to decipher one of these
transmissions.
In other words, when the ALEX system is operating--it
cannot be decoded. The ALEX system has 700 Billion Trillion codes! Yes,
the intelligence agencies/Illuminati have really outdone themselves with
overkill on this one! By the way, this is very ULTRA secret. The ALEX
system intersects with the Monarch Mind Control Programming. The ALEX
(also called ALEXUS) is part of the tracking and AntiChrist-Call-Back
Programming. Outside computers are able to interconnect with the Monarch
Mind Control slave and call them back for AntiChrist activities. In
other words, the Council of 9 of the Illuminati has placed an alter by
the name of Alex or a similar name in high level slaves and they have
either via implants or some other type of programming made these slaves
available for programming via electronic communications that tie in with
their ALEX computers. (Fritz Springmeier touched on this AntiChrist
programming in his Chapter 3 Mind Control monograph in 1992,
when he mentioned Imperial conditioning.) Actually Imperial and Emperor
programming are programs that work in conjunction with the ALEX system.
All the police in this nation are to have their communications encrypted
by Christmas, 1995 in time for the start of the most intense period of
anarchy. The concentration camps, FEMA, FDIC, and the all the rest of
the acronym monsters are switching over to the secret operational
frequencies which this paragraph will now provide you. This will be 912
meg. to 954 meg. using either or both the ALEX or General Dynamic
scrambles. Motorola is providing the hardware. In other words, when the
most intense period of anarchy and arrests begins, the New World Order
(Big Brother) will have electronic transmission capabilities which will
be totally secret. Even police transmissions which can be listened to
now by the bad guys will no longer be receivable. The Illuminati have been
saving their best technology for use during their takeover in the next
few years. Implants within slaves are being used to communicate such
thoughts as (actual samples of things sent):
a.
murder your family
b.
the government is to blame, murder the President
c.
you can not get legal redress for what has been done to you by the
government
d.
it is hopeless to fight us
e. you want to
have sex with the opposite sex
f. you want to
deal in drugs
g.
you want to protect your country by being loyal to the CIA
Since the early 1960s, the Intelligence agencies have been putting
two-way radio communication implants into victims. This is called
telemetry or remote control. The radio wave enters the implant, the
implant transmits it to the brain, and the brains reaction is then
picked up and relayed back to a computer which decodes what the brain
waves show the brain was thinking. These implants in the early 60s were
half the size of a cigarette filter. A few of victims have managed to
escape the control of the System and get x-ray pictures of the implants
and then have them removed. One victim in this Portland area has tried
for years to find a legitimate surgeon to remove the implant. Liquid
crystals are said by some to be used. It is said that the liquid
crystals are implanted to function as transmitters. Others say that the
liquid crystals were tried and were lethal.
ACCESSORIES
It
was discovered that if a strobe is flashed into the eyes at ten
cycles/per sec. or 10 hertz (hz), the brain will retune itself to that
frequency. The brain will downshift from a beta state of consciousness
down to an alpha or below. The entire cortex is influenced by the strobe
light. Actually, this was just a rediscovery of what some of the
ancients had discovered. Flashing lights have been used by people to go
into altered states for a long time. Ptolemy, the famous ancient Greek
astronomer built a wheel that would flash sunlight, and people would
stare at this contraption and go into an altered state. As with many
inventions, they can be used for good or bad. The following machines are
things that anyone can purchase, just like a stun gun or a cattle prod.
An array of mind-altering electronic devices have been created over the
last few decades. Personal light-and-sound machines that alter the
brains consciousness that were once $60,000 dollars are now a few
hundred. They have goggles that fit over a persons eyes.
The Synchro Energizer, which requires a trained operator to run its
control panel, is a machine to electronically alter the brains
consciousness with a sound and light show. Nine lights work via the
goggles to give a light show to alter the brains wave pattern. It is
sold by Synchro-Tech of Cleveland via Syncho Energize on Broadway, NY.
An operator can start the Synchro Energizer at the brains high beta
waves and then takes the wave pattern downward through the alpha, and
then to the theta and sometimes into the delta (the sleep state). There
are smaller machines designed to do the same thing, such as the
Relaxman, built by Synchro-Tech.
Comptronic Device Ltd. has put out a
similar but superior machine called D.A.V.I.D.Jr. It can place a person
into a deep delta wave sleep. These are just what are available to the
public. Imagine what NASA, the NSA, and CIA have. If one needs to work
with more than one person, the Synchro-energizer ($60,000) also built by
Synchro-Tech will place 32 people at the same time into altered states
of consciousness. This machine uses full-spectrum lights to change the
brains state of consciousness. The Lumatron machine uses strobe lights
that can be set to eleven different frequencies. When the light is
directed through the retina it is converted to an electrical nerve
impulse called a photocurrent. Eventually, the photocurrent passes
throughout the entire brain. Genesis is a machine which measures the
brains responses and then matches music to that response. Hospitals and
corporations have been purchasing Genesis machines. The Twilight
Learning Device is a bio-feedback machine that has an EEG machine hooked
up to two tape recorders.
There are dozens of technical articles on a whole host of subjects
relating to the implants. This is a vast subject that really needs its
own book. FOR FURTHER STUDY of the big SUBJECT of IMPLANTS the reader is
directed for starts to the FOLLOWING ARTICLES: Scotland on Sunday,
2 April 1995, had an article about how U.S. and Swedish scientists
have pioneered a method to graft neurons to a computer chip.
Stanford
University, CA helped with this. A person can now be hot-wired to a
computer, such as Arnold Schwartzenegger in the film Total Recall.
·LA Times, 8/17/94, article about the Hughes Identification Device

Barry
Karr of the Center for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the
Paranormal states, We havent heard of anything that, without the
shadow of a doubt, couldnt have been made here on Earth. Lets see the
evidence. It is clear that some people are now realizing that these
implants are being placed into people by human slave owners, who simply
are hypnotically telling their slaves that they are aliens. IBM began
work on the implantable microchips under the cover of other goals. In
the 1960s G.E. took over the development. Honeywell continued the work
after they merged. The R2E Division of the cIIi Honeywell Bull in France
has then gone on to develop the Smart card.
Lithium batteries in
implants were secretly being used in the 1960s long before the public
got wind. Fairchild has publicly announced several years ago that they
have a bio-chip the size of a human hair with 4 times the capacity of
the BT952000 project. These are some of the companies who have provided
the Network with a large assortment of implantable chips.
IN SUMMARY
Electro shock is used to control a slave and to erase memory. Stun guns
are used daily on some slaves. Slaves are under so much control that
they will shock themselves if the master wants them to.
Equipment has been developed to alter states of consciousness
electronically, and also to track, and monitor slaves. The most serious
development in electronics for mind-control is their ability with high
tech equipment to actually place thoughts into a persons mind. Harmonic
machines (given code-names) are now being used to do lots of the
programming. Powerful individual & mass-mind control can take place via
electronic means; our question, who will control the controllers of
these electronic means? So far the American & European people have been
content to let them get by with what they have done.
