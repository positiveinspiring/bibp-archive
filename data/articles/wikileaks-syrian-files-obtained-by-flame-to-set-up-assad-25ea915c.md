WikiLeaks has released damning emails
embarrassing Syria and exposing Syrias opponents, says Julian Assange:
There were more than 2.4 million emails that
show correspondence between Syrian political figures, ministries and
associated companies between August 2006 and March 2012.
The Associated Press
reports,
WikiLeaks Sarah Harrison told journalists
at Londons Frontline Club that the emails reveal interactions between
the Syrian government and Western companies, although she declined to go
into much further detail
WikiLeaks posted only a handful of the
documents to its website Thursday, but the disclosure - whose source
WikiLeaks has not made clear - wouldnt be the first major leak of
Syrian emails.
Harrison
said that the material is embarrassing to
Syria but claims that Syrias opponents will equally be ashamed.
It helps us not merely to criticize one
group or another, but to understand their interests, actions and
thoughts. It is only through understanding this conflict that we can
hope to resolve it.
Called The Syrian Files numerous diplomatic
correspondences are more of an exposure to insider information than
WikiLeaks disclosure concerning the US governments role and responsibility
in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The hacked emails include:
-
Correspondence from the Baath party
-
Contains information on foreign affairs,
finance and Assads presidential business
-
Records of financial transfers from
Syrian ministries to nations
-
Over 68,000 are in Russian
Russia is in arms trade with Syria even though
the UN with pressure from the US has imposed sanctions against Assads
government because of the fake revolution called the Arab Spring that was
inspired and controlled by Soros infiltrators and the CIA.
WikiLeaks and Assange have not verified all the emails because of the
sheer volume, however they claim that they are statistically confident
that the files they have obtained are genuine.
Questions concern Assanges connections to the CIA and his ability to expose
leaked information:
As a psy-op, the manifestation of Assange and
WikiLeaks has effectively used engineered operations of secret document
exposure to give the appearance of forced political responsibility for
intelligence and policy failures.
This is detailed in the CIA document entitled,
The Secret Team.
The
CIA connection to Assange creates an avenue where fake leaks of
documents can be made to give the illusion to the public that they are privy
to secret information.
Meanwhile, the CIA people-power coup has been integral in many fake
revolutions both in the streets of foreign nations and on the internet.
WikiLeaks assisted the US governments overthrow of the Tunisian government.
Assanges portrayal as a lone wolf just trying to expose corruption has
aided the US government as the perfect psy-op cover that convinces
individuals to rally in favor of their hero, Julian Assange, and keep his
crusade alive:
These emails
come just prior to the meeting in Paris where the Friends of
Syria group, which supports Assads removal. Russia, who is not attending
the meeting, says that this is a ruse to combine efforts against Assad and
create more international support for a force regime change and pending
military strike.
Haaretz reported back in February that Anonymous hacked into Syrian servers
and extracted emails. These emails supposedly exposed, among other things,
Assads wifes shopping sprees; however the obviousness of this claim is
simply propaganda intended to defame the Assad government while the Obama
administration, Israel and the UN peacemakers publicly decry for either
war or Assads voluntary stepping down.
While the arrest of Ryan Cleary, member of LuzSec, was first announced, it
became apparent that the LuzSec.
Anonymous link was concrete.
The origination of Anonymous is traceable to the
CIA as an attempt of the US government to create a false flag threat that
justifies the Obama administrations restriction of information flow and
freedom on the internet.
The
hacktivist movement has spawned new off-shoots of the main groups
Anonymous and LuzSec, named LuzSec Reborn, MalSec, and SpexSec. These
groups are using the same techniques as Anonymous, with new names. The
nature of these groups is to wreak havoc, break apart, and come together
under a different name to begin the process over again.
During on the of
the CIA directed hacks, Anonymous gained information from
foreign servers in Syria. This was achieved with the
use of Flame, the
descendent of
Stuxnet.
These US government agents posing as hacktivists are
pretending to be independent persons in a nameless, faceless hacking group
hell-bent on cyber-attacking government agencies.
Flame, analyzed by Eugene Kaspersky, of the Russian Kaspersky Lab,
was found to be
capable of:
-
Stealing data via USB memory stick
-
Steal information whether or not the
computer is connected to the internet
-
Have the exact same programing
properties as Stuxnet
-
Linked usage to the US government and
Israel
The leaks Assange has revealed directly benefit
the US, Israeli and UN campaign to remove Assad from his governmental seat
and implant a stooge, just as was done with
the election of Muslim
Brotherhood member Muhammad Morsi.
In Egypt, the move of Morsi to presidential power benefits the US government
as Morsi has already destroyed the Egyptian constitution, disbanded their
parliament, and made clear assertions of compliance with Israeli agendas to
remove Assad from power in Syria.
The case against Assad is mounting, although it is mostly propaganda taken
as fact and spun in the mainstream media worldwide. This revelation from
WikiLeaks assists the desire of Obama, Netanyahu and
the United
Nations to control the
Syrian government.
This is all very easy to understand:
a CIA operation where information
stolen from Syrian computer servers by Flame (which is the cyber-weapon of
the US government) was given to Anonymous (who are CIA agents) and leaked
by WikiLeaks (the fake whistleblower website).
