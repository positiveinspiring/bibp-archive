Cites false reports regarding Syria
"massacre" to call for UN Chapter 7.
Irresponsible warmongering leaves American
credibility irrevocably damaged.
Image: US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has
attempted on numerous occasions to leverage fabricated
atrocities to stampede UN resolutions through the
Security Council to allow the same destructive, tragic
military campaign against Syria that was waged
against
Libya.
Her
latest outburst was so overtly fraudulent and patently
false, her continuation as Secretary of State risks a
permanent and exponentially accelerating decline in US
legitimacy worldwide.
July 14, 2012
The unhinged state of US foreign policy is
exemplified best by this week's Tremseh, Syria "massacre."
Before any confirmations could be made, and
based solely on "activist" accounts,
Hillary
Clinton penned
a US State Department statement that read:
I was deeply saddened and outraged to learn
of reports of yet another massacre committed by the Syrian regime that
has claimed the lives of over 200 men, women, and children in the
village of Traymseh.
Credible reports indicate that this
unconscionable act was carried out by artillery, tanks, and helicopters
- indisputable evidence that the regime deliberately murdered innocent
civilians. Syria cannot be peaceful, stable, or democratic until Assad
goes and a political transition begins. We call for an immediate
ceasefire in and around Hama to allow the UN observer mission to enter
Traymseh.
Those who committed these atrocities will be
identified and held accountable.
As long as the Assad regime continues to wage war against the Syrian
people, the international community must keep increasing the pressure on
the regime to halt the violence and allow for a political solution to go
forward. The Security Council should put its full weight behind the
Annan plan for an immediate ceasefire and a political transition and
make clear to the Syrian regime that there will be consequences for
non-compliance.
History will judge this Council. Its members
must ask themselves whether continuing to allow the Assad regime to
commit unspeakable violence against its own people is the legacy they
want to leave.
The Security Council of course would be putting
its "full weight" behind Kofi Annan's "peace plan"
with Chapter 7 provisions in place -
meaning that sanctions and military intervention, as it was in Libya, would
be subsequently implemented.
What US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attempted to do, was propose a UN
Security Council resolution authorizing military intervention (and by
consequence, long sought after regime change), then used fabricated reports
to sell the resolution in the court of global public and diplomatic opinion.
It constitutes an overt crime against peace, and
conspiracy to wage aggressive war - both Nuremberg offenses.
Tremseh was a Battle,
Not a Massacre
As the facts emerge as to what really happened in Tremseh, Syria, it becomes
evidently clear the US State Department, along with its,
-
British
-
French
-
German
-
Australian,
...counterparts, has attempted to sell yet another
NATO war of aggression based on a patently false pretext.
The New York Times in their article, "New
Details of a Battle Challenge Reports of a Syrian Massacre,"
reported that,
"activists," the so-called "Free Syria Army"
(FSA), and the Western-backed "Syrian National Council" (SNC) all gave
conflicting reports.
What could be
verified by UN monitors who arrived at the
scene, is that the vast majority of those "massacred" were men of fighting
age, with some opposition figures conceding that they were indeed militant
fighters.
The number "200" that Clinton cited, was
actually the number of militants that had gathered in Tremseh to plot the
next leg of their terrorist activities. Locals had passed the
information on to the Syrian Army who surrounded the area and neutralized
the fighters during a pitched battle the FSA ultimately lost.
Not only that, but the UN confirms that Syrian security operations targeted
"specific" rebel locations rendering Clinton's accusation that government
forces "deliberately murdered innocent civilians" a bold-faced lie.
In other words, Hillary Clinton falsified her statement, given before the
entire "international community," claiming "200 men, women, and children"
were deliberately massacred, when in reality it was the Syrian military
restoring order in the face of armed terrorists.
After the military secured the Tremseh area,
they put on display a vast cache of weaponry found in the area, as well as
captured FSA militants including both Turkish and Libyan fighters - meaning
that those not killed in the fighting, were not "executed" as earlier
reports falsely stated.
Hillary Clinton Must
Resign
The generation preceding Hillary Clinton's, those of World War II, swore
"never again" to the tragedy of that global conflict.
They also swore "never again" to the lies and
manipulations that maneuvered millions of people across the globe into
deadly conflict with one another. Hillary Clinton's fabrications and
attempts to foist yet another war constructed upon falsehoods betrays that
promise made - and thus betrays and jeopardizes the very foundation of all
the West stands for.
Hillary Clinton, to continue in her capacity, like the entire Bush
Administration before her, compromises and forever stains the credibility
and integrity of the United States.
It is ironic that the very violence unfolding in
Syria today, which Clinton would have the world believe is the work of the
"Syrian regime," was first blueprinted and orchestrated by the US during
Bush's term in office.
Indeed, according to Seymour Hersh's 2007 New Yorker article, "The
Redirection," the US, Israel, and the Gulf State despots plotted
to assemble and unleash a front of sectarian extremists to overthrow the
government of Syria.
It was during that time that the Syrian
Muslim
Brotherhood began receiving funding and support from the West while fighters
and weapons were assembled in northern Lebanon under the watch of Saad
Hariri.
Not only has the
Barack Obama
administration, with Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State,
inherited and perpetuated this
violent conspiracy against the Syrian people,
it has inherited and perpetuated the dishonor and straining of America's
remaining integrity and global good will.
For America's economy which cannot shoulder
another military adventure, for America's honor which cannot find space to
fit another scar, Hillary Clinton must resign and those in Congress and
throughout industry must remove support for those squandering the last of
America's once vast potential in pursuit of global hegemony.
Surely Clinton's resignation would be more symbolic than a serious blow to a
system that is in reality driven by corporate-financier interests from
amongst their think-tanks, lobbying networks, and media empires, but it
would the beginning of a new paradigm that signaled the days of impunity for
these special interests drawing to a close.
For the people of America, who most likely will not witness their Secretary
of State resign in the wake of the disgrace and irreparable damage she has
brought upon her nation, now more than ever they must be resolved to
identify, expose, boycott and replace
the corporate financier interests for whom Hillary Clinton works.
We as a people must begin
creating our own, local institutions that
serve our interests directly, and begin engaging in real "wrench-turning"
activism in place of our current domesticated consumerist attitude towards
politics and progress.
