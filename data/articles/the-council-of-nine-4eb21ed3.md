The Council of Nine
Apart from the replies given in the following chapter, one very striking aspect of these transmissions is the ability that Tom has for accurate and total recall of the content of earlier conversations. He has often said "Look to your transcriptions of two years ago" and has also acknowledged that what for us might take months of research, they can do in seconds. The understanding of the origins of the Nine would seem to be bounded by the inner development of the individual, (be it the questioner or the reader). For as Tom has said:
"if there is one who would ask of questions that cannot assimilate and cannot in truth understand, we do not answer until they are in that moment when they can".
This is why the chapter starts off with several different people asking the same sorts of question.
Tom once replied: "We are in truth Aeons" in reference to the Gnostic philosophers, and that very conversation appears later in the book. An Aeon is a term commonly used to describe a period of time, an eternity. However it also describes the highest form of Celestial power, spiritual entities formed from the Divine Presence.
This first exchange, which took place in 1975 is between Gene Roddenberry (of Star Trek fame). Gene had some very long sessions with Tom, and more of them will be found later on in this section.
GENE: To whom am I talking? Do you have a name?
Tom: I am Tom. I am the spokesman for the Council of Nine. In truth I am Tehuti. Yes. I am also Hamarkos, I am also Herenkar, I am known as Thomas and I am known as Atum.
GENE: Are you one of the Nine or are you a separate being?
Tom: I sit in the Council of Nine, yes. I am one that is in wisdom that speaks to you. But the Council has said that, in communications, at times I sound not wisdom Yes.
This is the reply that Tom gave to another questioner in 1977 on the same subject:
GUEST: I would like to ask what is it that greets me?
Tom: I am the spokesman. I am known as Tom for the Council of Nine. I am of the Nine.
GUEST: Whom do you represent? A higher authority above you that commands you and directs your ways?
Tom: This is difficult to explain, for the world has no similar situation. But we would say to you - yes, we are in connection with one that is higher, but in totality together we are one, as all the Universe is one.
GUEST: Do you have any purpose in our world, any major message?
Tom: We wish you to know firstly that we are not physical beings. Your world is the manifestation of creation and of the Creator manifest in your world - in the form of humankind. You ask if we have a message for you?
GUEST: Yes, I do.
Tom: We say to you: You have been created in the image of the Creator. This world has lost its identity with creation. What is, of necessity to understand is the going forth and creating action and deed that brings you to completion in who you are. It is not enough to pray, it is not enough to gather groups of humankind for meditation. What is important is to act.
GUEST: Thank you very much, Tom.
ANDREW: I was particularly interested in 'Hamarkos'. Could you tell us...
Tom: I am the day, and I am the evening, and I am the mid-noon.
ANDREW: How did the Egyptians come to build and name the Sphinx after you?
Tom: You found the secret, the true knowledge of that will be related another time. But the original time that I was on the Planet Earth or identified with your Planet Earth was 34,000 of your years ago. I am the balance. And when I say 'I' - I mean because I am an emissary for the Nine. It is not I, but it is the group. And the principle of the Nine is infinite intelligence, and what we try to bring to this planet is this type of intelligence. We are of nine principles of the Universe, yet together we are one. We are separate and one at the same time. Each represents a portion of energy, knowledge, wisdom, love, kindness, technology, and in continuity it goes on until each portion of a spiral is composed of all that is important to bring complete understanding to each atom, until it becomes one with us. There are in actuality multiplications and more, but in principle there are nine.
We are what is identified [in the Hebraic tradition] as the Elohim. We wish you to know we are not God. We are collective and become one. We wish you to know that we are you as you are we. You created us, and out of that creation you were created. Do not underestimate who you are, and your ability.
Know that all people are pure, that you are perfect, and that all things are possible with you. Know also that we cannot exist without you and all souls, and neither can Planet Earth nor the Universe. When you understand that, you will understand your own life. At times in your world people create confusion, for the density of it is a density of darkness. But always hold the light of truth of your own being, who you are, in your heart. We are with you always. We give you love, we bring you peace.
ANDREW: If I may just give you my conception of what you are like: I gather that you are pure light-beings, in a sense that we don't even understand, because you exist at a velocity beyond light..
Tom: It is beyond your comprehension.
ANDREW: Yes, but essentially you would be of that nature rather than anything substantive...
Tom: That is true.
ANDREW: ... something beyond photons, beyond tachyons [the least divisible known quanta or subdivisions of light]. And secondly I would assume that you are more of the nature of what we call 'soul' than any other thing we can imagine...
Tom: We are soul.
ANDREW: You are soul. Now, in your relationship to the Nine for example - are the Nine of the same nature as you are?
Tom: We are one and the same.
ANDREW: I see. And then could you explain the profound mystery: why there are nine basic manifestations of, guess we should use the word 'God,' for lack of a better term?
Tom: I will try to explain it in a manner in which you may understand. Nine is complete. Everything is nine. In your world you have said seven so many times, when everything is truly nine. There are nine chakras, which are the nine principles and nine elements of what you call God. There are nine bands around this planet Earth. There are nine etheric bodies, and the purpose of growing your etheric bodies or going through your transformations and transitions is to attain the nine etheric bodies. Nine is a complete number, it is whole. When you go over a nine it cancels, it becomes one, and a nine is complete. This does not change. But remember this: we ourselves are not God. All of you and all of us make God.
Then came a discussion on language:
ANDREW: Have you some method of producing your language so that we could hear the quality of it.
Tom: When we speak of what our language is, it comes from deep within. It reaches different degrees but it is a tonal language. In your languages on Earth you speak in a box and then you throw it out.
JOHN: Yes. Our language is produced in the vocal chords.
Tom: We speak in this box and then we push air and throw it out, do you understand that?
ANDREW: Yes.
Tom: And our language, it is within. It vibrates from the body, do you understand?
ANDREW: Then it does not come out the way ours does at all.
Tom: No, it does not.
ANDREW: Does it produce a sound which another ear can hear?
Tom: It produces a sound that you may hear but it is inside.
ANDREW: In other words, it is produced inside my head rather than my ears? Is that why you mean that the tonal range of your language is in 98.6 megacycles?
Tom: That is correct.
ANDREW: In other words, it is what we would call a radio wave?
Tom: That is also correct.
In this next transmission, one questioner names various Biblical characters from Genesis (Chapters 4 and 5), descendants of Adam, asking whether any of these were members of the Nine.
Tom: In totality of understanding we are not any of those. There are hints of us upon your planet. There are many who try to understand who we are. In your earthliness, it is difficult for you to accept that that you do not understand! At times the attempt to understand colours the truth of the Universe. There are only keys for unlocking portions, for the human mind cannot totally comprehend. There are many interpretations and also many conflicts about who we are. Yes. In a future time we will attempt to explain ourselves on another level of consciousness, but first Planet Earth must reach that state of evolutionary consciousness where we may be understood, yes. The Council has said do not try to put us into a box, we do not exist in that form, yes.
JOHN: Is it true to say that there are several dimensions between us and yourselves?
Tom: That would be an understatement. There are many. Within, in your mind, visualize your Earth. Then from your Earth visualize that there are waves spiralling outward. And one wave creates another, and as it circulates, it grows. And it creates more and more. And it is heavy in the beginning, and if it has a sound it is loud of sound. And as it radiates out it becomes refined, it becomes more expansive, and all of those irritants that exist within the physical planet Earth are eliminated as it becomes a pure sound and a pure wave. And if you would have it in the colour of browns or blacks, as it is radiating out it is also being purified, until it becomes in truth the colour of colourless, which is in truth a golden light. We are at the extent of that. We are - how may we say to you? As you can take a sound until it becomes the purest, and as you can take a colour until it becomes the purest, and if you can take all vibrations until their level has raised until the pitch is of a pure nature - that is where we are.
JOHN: I see. That's a beautiful picture. Thank you.
Tom: It is as if you would take all that was spiritual within the Universe, and all that was of the intellect within the Universe, and take all of the physicalness that has been refined, and blend it together to make one pureness. It is a like a crystal.
ANDREW: What we would like to know is something of your natural history. We would like to know what you look like, how you reproduce, what you do for nourishment, what is your role in the Universe, what is your interest in the Earth, and so on? I think it would help all of us enormously if you could just give us some idea of who you are in the more descriptive sense.
Tom: We do not have a physical body. Although we may put on the mantle of a physical body when it is necessary. It would be difficult for us to describe to you exactly what we appear like. We appear in many forms, when that is necessary. And in your thought-process we may appear as a human, we may appear as an energy ball, we may appear as a very bright light. We have evolved beyond the point of needing a physical-type body, as many souls need. We are always here, but you do not always see us. When I say we, I do not mean me, but I mean all of us. We are often observing. There are particular times in your life when we do not observe, and that is when you are involved with your desires. We do not understand this, and it is none of our affair.
ANDREW: I see. So assuming you had certain physical energies to draw upon, you could mould into something that would manifest in our world. Is that the idea?
Tom: It would be similar to that, but you would not understand our technology. We are in our mind what we think we are at that time. Do you understand this? We exist in the zone of cold. Because of this we have no problem in manifesting in any manner in which we desire. As far as our reproduction is concerned, we do not need reproduction. You must remember that those of us that live in this zone have come a very long way in evolving. It is not necessary to reproduce as it is in your place. We are soul.
ANDREW: What part of the Universe do you work in, or what is your management...
Tom: We are the Universe.
ANDREW: Now, in this Universe, there are worlds of matter, antimatter, photons, rays, energies, particles and more. Which part of this domain do you exist in, or is it beyond our comprehension?
Tom: It is beyond your comprehension. We come from the zone that is cold. This is perfection.
ANDREW: You know, on Earth we are just beginning to understand, very feebly, the zone of cold or superconductivity, and we know that there is no resistance there, no friction, in other words, in our simple notion, it is the area of perpetual motion. Is that not essentially true?
Tom: This is true and this is perfection. We are in the centre. And we do not wish to sound as if we are perfect or as if we are egotistical, but on either side of us there is the positive and there is the negative. And when I say this I mean there is the positive that is not balanced, and there is the negative that is not balanced. We are in the centre, and we are balanced. We are trying to bring those other forces into balance. We have never been out of balance. It is other things in the Universe that are not in balance. We exist at the pivotal point of the Universe. There is a balance. Within each of you there is all of the positive and all of the negative of the Universe. Do you understand?
ANDREW: No, I don't. Because you told us once that you were neither on the good nor bad side, you were the pivot in between.
Tom: Yes. But do you understand that you are the balance of this?
JOHN: We have all of the good and all of the bad ... ?
Tom: That's why you are the balance. And why we are the balance. You understand matter and anti-matter?
ANDREW: We never have in our world any fusion of matter and antimatter - you are telling us something quite foreign. Matter and antimatter exist independently. If they get together there is a gigantic explosion...
Tom: What is Armageddon?
ANDREW: I don't know. Just a word in the Bible.
Tom: Is it not a giant explosion?
ANDREW: That's not matter and anti-matter, is it?
Tom: I am making an analogy. How may we explain?
ANDREW: I don't know, it's very difficult because the Earth concept does not fit the one that you are trying to explain.
Tom: We will begin at the beginning. In each of you, as in each of us, there is completeness. Completeness is a perfect harmony and balance between what you call 'good' and 'evil.' This is what keeps us in the pivotal point. This is why we are the pivot, because we are in balance. When we are together we are one and we are the pivot. Assume that we live in a world of matter - it is not true, but imagine that. Now the Council of Nine is in the centre. And on our right would be the world of matter and on our left the world of anti-matter, you understand this? If the two came together we would have an explosion.
ANDREW: But the reason I have difficulty is that you said we are a composite of both sides of polarity, so how could there be another side when we are a composite already?
Tom: You have not understood what we have said.
ANDREW: If you're a composite, you don't have two sides, see? If you have black and white you can have two sides, but black and white is not a composite, grey is the composite. I'm having difficulty...
Tom: You are explaining in your world, we are explaining in ours. Shall we say, in essence .... ?
ANDREW: In essence, okay. That makes it easier to deal with, if it's the essence rather than the actual substance, whatever that maybe...
Tom: It is the essence.
ANDREW: All right.
Tom: There is balance within all. What causes the great dissension is a similar situation to putting together matter and anti-matter. They cannot mingle, they cannot mix in harmony, they cannot blend, they become destructive to each other.
Here again, Andrew has another exchange with Tom on duality: and Tom takes several attempts to clarify the picture for him:
ANDREW: We do have difficulty understanding what is negative and what is positive, in respect of what is called 'good' and 'bad' on the human level.
Tom: It is difficult in your physical world for you to truly understand the importance of both. I will try to explain in a manner in which you may understand. It would be similar to a giant scale. We are in the pivot of this giant scale. Visualize the Universe with the pivot being us. On one side of the Universe, visualize that all is negative, and all on the other side is positive. And as you see this, you know that there is a complete out-of-balance situation. It is difficult for us to explain this so that you may understand. Within each of the sides there are many ... I will explain it in earthly terms: As each of the galaxies and solar systems within the galaxies first I must clarify: The Universe, with the Nine in the centre, has four sides, the side opposite that in which you exist and the other two are all in balance. Do you understand?
ANDREW: Yes, I'm following.
Tom: It is in perfect balance. On this side we will now place your solar systems within your galaxies and the galaxies. If you would take a stone for each of these galaxies, if they were in perfect weight and perfect proportion to the rest of the three sides, then this would be also in balance. But if one of those stones were of a porous substance, and if you placed it in oil, and it absorbed the oil, and became weighted with the oil, then in turn it would upset the balance and pull the balance and the scale out of calibration, and would upset the other side of the Universe. Your Planet is accomplishing that. The negative is the heavy oil. Remember: the other sides are balanced, but this imbalance can in turn topple the rest. That is not correct. In actuality there is no good and there is no bad. It is only when one of them becomes sour or rotten that it then contaminates the rest, be it good or bad. Because of the ignorance of the peoples of Planet Earth, and because their religious leaders have taught ignorance, your negative forces, which do not truly appear as you see them, manifest in that way in order to instill fear. But what is truly negative - listen carefully - what has created the upset, besides the desires and the greed, is the complete denial and misinterpretation of the existence of ultimate reality. Your over-population is because of the trapping of spirits, because of reincarnation. So the Earth people, the souls and spirits that surround your Earth need to release themselves of greed and desire, because that is the trap. Your religious leaders do not understand this and do not teach the people.
Remember that in you is a seed of purity and beauty, and that if you do not maintain a balance, ugliness or an ugly part may appear. But remember forgiveness. We hold no animosity within us, and you should not do so either. Even though you exist upon a physical planet and the densest of all the planets in the Universe, remember that all souls may be saved. The only thing of which we are unforgiving is in the denunciation of God...
ANDREW: Yes, I understand I think at times there have been occasions we have been guilty of that attitude.
Tom: This is a truth. But remember to forgive when there is true acknowledgement. May we say to you, to voice what you feel is one thing, but it is the act that is important. There are many actors upon the world's stage that play a different part than what they feel. It is when they begin to feel they are that part, not themselves, that it makes a big difference. They may say they love God, and they may say that they have understanding, but if they do not act in that way, then that is a graver problem, because it is not done in ignorance. It is the same as when you give to another because you believe it obligates the other to give back, then what you give is not gold, it is black and putrid. We wish you also to know that we do not have the need to be worshipped. Our need from you is to be loved. Do you know who is God?
ANDREW: I know who is God in the abstract sense.
Tom: Do you know truly who is God?
ANDREW: Not truly, no.
Tom: Are you prepared to know who God is?
ANDREW: I would be prepared, yes. I do not know what that means in terms of consequences, but yes, I would be prepared.
Tom: Love is God. And it is love that creates the energy which feeds God - and makes God. In your world there are religious groups that say that God is within. And this is true because there is a portion of divinity within each individual. But what we have told you is not the same.
ANDREW: It took me a long time to square up with this, the notion that the Nine collectively are God, and that we all collectively are God..
Tom: Remember that as God we all carry a heavy burden but also we carry joy.
ANDREW: Well, being in the centre, can you go on further to indicate how we stand between the negative and the positive?
Tom: Remember this: that the position that you have chosen in your physical world is limited. But remember who you are. Never lose sight of who you are. And remember that in God all things are possible and will be done. The problem is the limits of the physical mind and understanding. And also remember that as God, in order to maintain the balance in your physical world, you must at times be detached. Gently you must detach. Because the work that conscious people on Earth have to do does not involve one or two individuals or the multiplication of those individuals. The work you humans have to do involves the Universe. And remember: God never fails. In your physical world, you as God are being tested. Not that God can be tested, but your physical limitations to yourselves as God are being tested. And though we know that this may sound a contradiction to you, in being God and having a problem in the physical world, you must come to understand these problems of the physical world. There are some of us who have never had this problem, and it's difficult for those of us that have not had it to understand. God is all knowing and is all-seeing but there are parts of God, as there are parts of every atom. The whole together makes one, but not all parts experience the same. Do you understand this?
ANDREW: Okay. We are beginning to get questions about the Nine. Not only do people ask 'who are they?' but also 'are they good or evil?' This is a problematic question to answer.
Tom: You are aware that difficulties have arisen because of the religions that have been perpetrated upon the peoples of Earth. So may we say to you, when people ask 'are they good or are they evil?' you know who you are and you know who we are, so you can happily, without doubt, say that the Nine are good and they wish to help. And if there are those that say 'But we have seen evil beings', then we would ask you to ask them to look within themselves. To see what you call evil does not mean that you must be evil to perceive it, but this is a way of helping those who believe in evil to look within themselves, to help themselves. Have we talked in riddles?
In 1991, another guest asked Tom the following question.
GUEST: What is the relationship of the Nine to God and to the Devil?
Tom: You cannot use that terminology of God and the opposite in the same sentence, for there is not of any equal to what you call God. For what you call God is the all-knowing, the total creation, all that is. That that you call by the name that you have used, we speak of as the opposition. You cannot equate that together. You ask us what is our relationship? We tell you now: We are not God. We have no relationship to the opposition. We are the Council of Nine that are in service to the Creator. The Creator is not destructive. The opposition is destructive.
And before that transmission, in the '70s, Andrew had had this conversation:
ANDREW: What do you say to those people who tend to think in terms of absolute good and evil, who use figures like Ahriman and Satan and so on...?
Tom: Ask them to look within themselves, and to understand that within each physical being there are all the elements of good and all the elements of what they call evil. We do not like that word 'evil.'
ANDREW: I don't either. It has the wrong connotation. But you know, many people are very pious.
Tom: They are not in truth pious, for they do not understand truth. They are in truth fanatics, they have doubt.
ANDREW: Yes, and they are the most difficult ones to ask to look into themselves; some of our most pious friends have become very anti the Nine's basic teachings.
Tom: Walk gently away from those, and the truth will come eventually. It is important that you do not start, may we say, pounding at them, but say 'You have your belief and I have mine.'
ANDREW: Yes, I think we've all learned that lesson.
Tom: You must be of great gentleness, but firm, do you understand? Keep to the purity within you, and know who you are, and do not contaminate your purity with other influences that will try to weaken you.
ANDREW: We have many physical and human weaknesses.
Tom: Not as many as you wish to believe.
ANDREW: But is doubt one of the prominent things?
Tom: Yes it is. It is as prominent as fear.
ANDREW: For myself, I do not really know fear - that is almost foreign to me.
Tom: But you have doubt.
ANDREW: I have doubt.
Tom: And that is the same.
ANDREW: I have skepticism. But I am learning. We have been reviewing our communications with you, and we are quite astounded at how much we have grown, and are kind of embarrassed to hear some of the things we said earlier! So I think to some extent we feel that we have made some progress in growing.
Tom: Remember we have grown with you, because when you grow we also grow.
ANDREW: That surprises me. Growth-potential still exists at the level of the Nine?
Tom: Yes. Because you are in the physical, and we are communicating directly with you, we are growing and coming to understand the physical, and that is important. We are not of the physical, and yet the paradox is that we are ahead of all that is physical. So do you understand how we grow with you?
ANDREW: Hmm, that's a difficult one, do you mean ahead in time? I don't quite understand that idea.
Tom: What has happened with us is that we have learned through you because we have attached to you, and we are now living your emotion and we are beginning to understand. The Council has said I should use the word 'beyond' and not the word 'ahead.'
ANDREW: I didn't realize that you were getting a refresher course in Earth experience.
Tom: It is not just Earth, it is physical, do you understand?
ANDREW. I only know Earth-physical, I don't know the physical throughout the Universe.
Tom: The Earth is the densest of all physical. And so what better place can we learn?
JOHN: One thing about doubt. I feel that blind faith is also a dangerous thing, and the fine line between the two must be found.
Tom: We never ask you for blind faith. Has there been a time in your entire existence upon Earth when suddenly you came upon something that made you become paralyzed with fear?
ANDREW: I think when I was a child I had a fear of snakes, but I overcame that
Tom: But you had that. Do you recall the moment?
ANDREW: Oh yes, I recall the moment when suddenly there was a rattler in front of me, and I just froze in fear, not knowing what to do.
Tom: That is something that we are beginning now to understand, but that is also the same as a doubt.
ANDREW: I see, that's very instructive.
Tom: But we do not ask you to follow in blind faith. You must at all times ask for clarification. You must never simply accept.
