Protection

This week, the European Parliament
voted to offer
Edward Snowden asylum
and protection and drop all criminal charges against him.
When at one time most of the world
was bullied by the US government into pressing charges against
Snowden and forcing him into exile, the entire European
continent has now officially given him a pass.
Thursday's 285-281 vote officially
recognized Snowden as an "international human rights defender"
and ensured that he would be free from arrest within European
borders.
The final resolution
mentioned that,
"too little has been done to safeguard
citizens' fundamental rights following revelations of
electronic mass surveillance."
Snowden is currently living in
asylum in Russia and is wanted in the United States for charges
under the federal Espionage Act, but Russia has declined to
extradite him.
He has been unable to leave due to
the fear of being kidnapped by the US military when he left the
country, but now it may be possible for him to travel to Europe.
Snowden posted on his Twitter page
that this could be a good sign of a shift in attitude towards
his cause.
Earlier this year, it was reported
that a federal appeals court
ruled that the controversial
NSA spy program which collects
phone records is actually illegal.
Snowden
recently joined Twitter, making
himself more visible and approachable to the general population
than ever before.
Within a day of opening his first
social media account since leaking information about the NSA spy
program, Snowden gained over one million subscribers. However,
there was only one account that he decided to follow, the NSA.
The whistleblower's first tweet
read,
"Can you hear me now?"
