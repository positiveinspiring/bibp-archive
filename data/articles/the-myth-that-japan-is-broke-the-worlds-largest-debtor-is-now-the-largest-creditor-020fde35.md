Largest Creditor

Japans
massive government debt
conceals
massive benefits for the Japanese people,
with lessons
for the U.S. debt crisis.
In an April 2012 article in Forbes titled If
Japan Is Broke, How Is It Bailing Out Europe?, Eamonn Fingleton
pointed out the Japanese government was by far the largest single non-Eurozone
contributor to the latest Euro rescue effort.
This, he said, is,
the same government that has been going
round pretending to be bankrupt (or at least offering no serious
rebuttal when benighted American and British commentators portray
Japanese public finances as a train-wreck).
Noting that it was also Japan that rescued
the IMF system virtually single-handedly at the height of the global
panic in 2009, Fingleton asked:
How can a nation whose government is
supposedly the most over-borrowed in the advanced world afford such
generosity?...
The betting is that Japans true public
finances are far stronger than the Western press has been led to
believe. What is undeniable is that the Japanese Ministry of Finance
is one of the most opaque in the world...
Fingleton acknowledged that the Japanese
governments liabilities are large, but said we also need to look at the
asset side of the balance sheet:
[T]he Tokyo Finance Ministry is
increasingly borrowing from the Japanese public not to finance
out-of-control government spending at home but rather abroad.
Besides stepping up to the plate to keep the IMF in business, Tokyo
has long been the lender of last resort to both the U.S. and British
governments.
Meanwhile it borrows 10-year money at an interest rate
of just 1.0 percent, the second lowest rate of any borrower in the
world after the government of Switzerland.
Its a good deal for the Japanese
government: it can borrow 10-year money at 1 percent and lend it to the
U.S. at 1.6 percent (the going rate on
U.S. 10-year bonds), making a tidy spread.
Japans debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly
230%, the worst of any major country in the
world. Yet Japan remains the worlds largest creditor country,
with net foreign assets of $3.19 trillion.
In 2010, its GDP per capita was more than that of France, Germany,
the U.K. and Italy. And while Chinas economy is now larger than
Japans because of its burgeoning population (1.3 billion versus 128
million), Chinas $5,414 GDP per capita is only 12 percent of Japans
$45,920.
How to explain these anomalies?
Fully 95 percent of Japans national debt is held domestically by
the Japanese themselves.
Over 20% of the debt is held by Japan Post
Bank, the Bank of Japan, and other government entities. Japan Post is
the largest holder of domestic savings in the world, and it returns
interest to its Japanese customers. Although theoretically privatized
in 2007, it has been a political football, and 100% of its stock is
still owned by the government.
The Bank of Japan is 55%
government-owned and 100% government-controlled.
Of the remaining debt, over 60% is held by
Japanese banks, insurance companies and pension funds. Another chunk is
held by individual Japanese savers.
Only 5% is held by foreigners, mostly central banks.
As noted in a
September 2011
article in The New York Times:
The Japanese government is in deep debt,
but the rest of Japan has ample money to spare.
The Japanese governments debt is
the peoples money. They own each other, and they collectively reap the
benefits.
Myths of the Japanese Debt-to-GDP
Ratio
Japans debt-to-GDP ratio looks bad. But
as economist Hazel Henderson notes, this is just a matter of
accounting practice - a practice that she and other experts contend is
misleading.
Japan
leads globally in virtually all areas of high-tech manufacturing,
including aerospace. The debt on the other side of its balance sheet
represents the payoffs from all this productivity to the Japanese
people.
According to Gary Shilling,
writing on Bloomberg in June 2012, more than half of Japanese
public spending goes for debt service and social security payments. Debt
service is paid as interest to Japanese savers.
Social security and interest on the national
debt are not included in GDP, but these are actually the social safety
net and public dividends of a highly productive economy.
These, more than the military weapons and
financial products that compose a major portion of U.S. GDP, are the
real fruits of a nations industry. For Japan, they represent the
enjoyment by the people of the enormous output of their high-tech
industrial base.
Shilling writes:
Government deficits are supposed to
stimulate the economy, yet the composition of Japanese public
spending isnt particularly helpful. Debt service and
social-security payments - generally non-stimulative - are expected
to consume 53.5 percent of total outlays for 2012...
So says conventional theory, but social
security and interest paid to domestic savers actually do stimulate the
economy. They do it by getting money into the pockets of the people,
increasing demand.
Consumers with money to spend then fill the
shopping malls, increasing orders for more products, driving up
manufacturing and employment.
Myths About Quantitative Easing
Some of the money for these government
expenditures has come directly from money printing by the central
bank, also known as quantitative easing. For over a decade, the Bank
of Japan has been engaged in this practice; yet the hyperinflation that
deficit hawks said it would trigger has not occurred.
To the contrary,
as noted by
Wolf Richter in a May 9, 2012 article:
[T]he Japanese [are] in fact among the
few people in the world enjoying actual price stability, with
interchanging periods of minor inflation and minor deflation - as
opposed to the 27% inflation per decade that the Fed has conjured up
and continues to call, moronically, price stability.
He cites as evidence the following graph
from the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs:
How is that possible? It all depends on
where the money generated by quantitative easing ends up.
In Japan, the
money borrowed by the government has found its way back into the pockets
of the Japanese people in the form of social security and interest on
their savings.
Money in consumer bank accounts stimulates demand,
stimulating the production of goods and services, increasing supply; and
when supply and demand rise together, prices remain stable.
Myths About the Lost Decade
Japans finances have long been shrouded in
secrecy, perhaps because when the country was more open about printing
money and using it to support its industries, it got
embroiled in World War II.
In his 2008 book In the Jaws of the
Dragon, Fingleton suggests that Japan feigned insolvency in the lost
decade of the 1990s to avoid drawing the ire of protectionist Americans
for its booming export trade in automobiles and other products.
Belying
the weak reported statistics, Japanese exports increased by 73% during
that decade, foreign assets increased, and electricity use increased by
30%, a tell-tale indicator of a flourishing industrial sector. By 2006,
Japans exports were three times what they were in 1989.
The Japanese government has maintained the
façade of complying with international banking regulations by
borrowing money rather than printing it outright.
But borrowing
money issued by the governments own central bank is the functional
equivalent of the government printing it, particularly when the debt is
just carried on the books and never paid back.
Implications for the Fiscal Cliff
All of this has implications for Americans
concerned with an out-of-control national debt.
Properly managed and
directed, it seems, the debt need be nothing to fear. Like Japan, and
unlike Greece and other Eurozone countries, the U.S. is the sovereign
issuer of its own currency. If it wished, Congress could fund its
budget without resorting to foreign creditors or private banks.
It
could do this either by issuing the money directly or by borrowing from
its own central bank, effectively interest-free, since the Fed rebates
its profits to the government after deducting its costs.
A little quantitative easing can be a good
thing, if the money winds up with the government and the people rather
than simply in the reserve accounts of banks.
The national debt can
also be a good thing. As Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Marriner Eccles testified in hearings before the House Committee on
Banking and Currency in 1941, government credit (or debt),
is what our
money system is. If there were no debts in our money system, there
wouldnt be any money.
Properly directed, the national debt becomes
the spending money of the people.
It stimulates demand, stimulating
productivity.
To keep the system stable and sustainable, the money just
needs to come from the nations own government and its own people, and
needs to return to the government and people.
