Admit it, mes amis, the rugged
individualism and cutthroat capitalism that made America the land of
unlimited opportunity has been shrink-wrapped by half a dozen short
sellers in Greenwich, Conn., and FedExed to Washington, D.C., to be
spoon-fed back to life by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Were now no different from
any of those Western European semi-socialist welfare states that we
love to deride.
Bill Saporito
How
We Became the United States of France
Time (September 21, 2008)
Last night, the Presidential candidates had
their last debate before the election.
They talked of the baleful state of the economy
and the stock market; but omitted from the discussion was what actually
caused the credit freeze, and whether the banks should be nationalized as
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson is now proceeding to do. The omission was
probably excusable, since the financial landscape has been changing so fast
that it is hard to keep up.
A year ago, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
broke through 14,000 to make a new all-time high. Anyone predicting then
that a year later the Dow would drop nearly by half and the Treasury would
move to nationalize the banks would have been regarded with amused
disbelief. But that is where we are today.1
Congress hastily voted to approve Treasury Secretary Hank Paulsons
$700 billion bank bailout plan on October 3, 2008, after a tumultuous week
in which the Dow fell dangerously near the critical 10,000 level. The
market, however, was not assuaged. The Dow proceeded to break through not
only 10,000 but then 9,000 and 8,000, closing at 8,451 on Friday, October
10.
The week was called the worst in U.S. stock
market history.
On Monday, October 13, the market staged a comeback the likes of which had
not been seen since 1933, rising a full 11% in one day. This happened after
the government announced a plan to buy equity interests in key banks,
partially nationalizing them; and
the
Federal Reserve led a push to flood the global financial system
with dollars.
The reversal was dramatic but short-lived. On October 15, the day of the
Presidential debate, the Dow dropped 733 points, crash landing at 8,578. The
reversal is looking more like a massive pump and dump scheme
artificially inflating the market so insiders can get out than a true
economic rescue.
The real problem is not in the much-discussed
subprime market but is in the credit market, which has dried up. The banking
scheme itself has failed. As was learned by painful experience during the
Great Depression, the economy cannot be rescued by simply propping up failed
banks.
The banking system itself needs to be
overhauled.
A Litany of Failed
Rescue Plans
Credit has dried up because many banks cannot meet the 8% capital
requirement that limits their ability to lend. A banks capital the money
it gets from the sale of stock or from profits can be fanned into more
than 10 times its value in loans; but this leverage also works the other
way. While $80 in capital can produce $1,000 in loans, an $80 loss from
default wipes out $80 in capital, reducing the sum that can be lent by
$1,000.
Since the banks have been experiencing
widespread loan defaults, their capital base has shrunk proportionately.
The bank bailout plan announced on October 3 involved using taxpayer money
to buy up mortgage-related securities from troubled banks. This was supposed
to reduce the need for new capital by reducing the amount of risky assets on
the banks books. But the banks risky assets include derivatives
speculative bets on market changes and derivative exposure for U.S. banks
is now estimated at a breathtaking $180 trillion.2
The sum represents an impossible-to-fill black
hole that is three times the gross domestic product of all the countries in
the world combined.
As one critic said of Paulsons roundabout
bailout plan,
this seems designed to help Hanks friends
offload trash, more than to clear a market blockage. 3
By Thursday, October 9, Paulson himself
evidently had doubts about his ability to sell the plan. He wasnt
abandoning his old cronies, but he soft-pedaled that plan in favor of
another option buried in the voluminous rescue package using a portion of
the $700 billion to buy stock in the banks directly.
Plan B represented a controversial move
toward nationalization, but it was an improvement over Plan A, which
would have reduced capital requirements only by the value of the bad debts
shifted onto the governments books. In Plan B, the money would be spent on
bank stock, increasing the banks capital base, which could then be
leveraged into ten times that sum in loans.
The plan was an improvement but the market was
evidently not convinced, since the Dow proceeded to drop another thousand
points from Thursdays opening to Fridays close.
One problem with Plan B was that it did not really mean nationalization
(public ownership and control of the participating banks). Rather, it came
closer to what has been called crony capitalism or corporate welfare.
The bank stock being bought would be non-voting preferred stock, meaning the
government would have no say in how the bank was run.
The Treasury would just be feeding the bank
money to do with as it would. Management could continue to collect enormous
salaries while investing in wildly speculative ventures with the taxpayers
money. The banks could not be forced to use the money to make much-needed
loans but could just use it to clean up their derivative-infested balance
sheets.
In the end, the banks were still liable to go
bankrupt, wiping out the taxpayers investment altogether.
Even if $700 billion were fanned into $7
trillion, the sum would not come close to removing the $180 trillion in
derivative liabilities from the banks books. Shifting those liabilities
onto the public purse would just empty the purse without filling the
derivative black hole.
Plan C, the plan du jour, does impose some limits on
management compensation. But the more significant feature of this weeks
plan is the Feds new Commercial
Paper Funding Facility, which is slated to be operational on
October 27, 2008. The facility would open the Feds lending window for
short-term commercial paper, the money corporations need to fund their
day-to-day business operations.
On October 14, the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York justified this extraordinary expansion of its lending powers by
stating:
The CPFF is authorized under Section 13(3)
of the Federal Reserve Act, which permits the Board, in unusual and
exigent circumstances, to authorize Reserve Banks to extend credit to
individuals, partnerships, and corporations that are unable to obtain
adequate credit accommodations...
The U.S. Treasury believes this facility is necessary to prevent
substantial disruptions to the financial markets and the economy and
will make a special deposit at the New York Fed in support of this
facility. 4
That means the government and the Fed are now
committing even more public money and taking on even more public risk. The
taxpayers are already tapped out, so the Treasurys special deposit will
no doubt come from U.S. bonds, meaning more debt on which the taxpayers have
to pay interest.
The federal debt could wind up running so high
that the government loses its own triple-A rating. The U.S. could be reduced
to Third World status, with austerity measures being imposed as a
condition for further loans, and hyperinflation running the dollar into
oblivion.
Rather than solving the problem, these rescue
plans seem destined to make it worse.
The Collapse of a 300
Year Ponzi Scheme
All the kings men cannot put the private banking system together again, for
the simple reason that it is a
Ponzi scheme that has reached its
mathematical limits. A Ponzi scheme is a form of pyramid scheme in which new
investors must continually be sucked in at the bottom to support the
investors at the top. In this case, new borrowers must continually be sucked
in to support the creditors at the top.
The Wall Street Ponzi scheme is built on
fractional reserve lending, which allows banks to create credit (or
debt) with accounting entries. Banks are now allowed to lend from 10 to 30
times their reserves, essentially counterfeiting the money they lend.
Over
97 percent of the U.S. money supply (M3) has been created by banks in this
way.5
The problem is that banks create only the
principal and not the interest necessary to pay back their loans. Since bank
lending is essentially the only source of new money in the system, someone
somewhere must continually be taking out new loans just to create enough
money (or credit) to service the old loans composing the money supply.
This spiraling interest problem and the need to
find new debtors has gone on for over 300 years - ever since the founding of
the Bank of England in 1694 - until the whole world has now become mired in
debt to the bankers private money monopoly.
As British financial analyst Chris Cook
observes:
Exponential economic growth required by the
mathematics of compound interest on a money supply based on money as
debt must always run up eventually against the finite nature of Earths
resources. 6
The parasite has finally run out of its food
source.
But the crisis is not in the economy itself,
which is fundamentally sound or would be with a proper credit system
to oil the wheels of production. The crisis is in the banking system,
which can no longer cover up the shell game it has played for three
centuries with other peoples money.
Fortunately, we dont need the credit of private
banks.
A sovereign government can create its own.
The New Deal Revisited
Todays credit crisis is very similar to that facing Franklin Roosevelt in
the 1930s.
In 1932, President Hoover set up the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) as a federally-owned
bank that would bail out commercial banks by extending loans to them, much
as the privately-owned Federal Reserve is doing today.
But like today, Hoovers plan failed.
The banks did not need more loans; they were
already drowning in debt. They needed customers with money to spend and to
invest. President Roosevelt used Hoovers new government-owned lending
facility to extend loans where they were needed most for housing,
agriculture and industry. Many new federal agencies were set up and funded
by the RFC, including the HOLC (Home Owners Loan Corporation)
and Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association,
which was then a government-owned agency).
In the 1940s, the RFC went into overdrive
funding the infrastructure necessary for the U.S. to participate in World
War II, setting the country up with the infrastructure it needed to become
the worlds industrial leader after the war.
The RFC was a government-owned bank that sidestepped
the
privately-owned Federal Reserve; but unlike the private banks
with which it was competing, the RFC had to have the money in hand before
lending it. The RFC was funded by issuing government bonds (I.O.U.s or debt)
and relending the proceeds.
The result was to put the taxpayers further
into debt.
This problem could be avoided, however, by
updating the RFC model. A system of public banks might be set up that had
the power to create credit themselves, just as private banks do now.
A public bank operating on the private bank
model could fan $700 billion in capital reserves into $7 trillion in public
credit that was derivative-free, liability-free, and readily available to
fund all those things we think we dont have the money for now, including
the loans necessary to meet payrolls, fund mortgages, and underwrite public
infrastructure.
Credit as a Public
Utility
Credit can and should be a national utility, a
public service provided by the government to the people it serves.
Many people are opposed to getting the
government involved in the banking system, but the fact is that the
government is already involved. A modern-day RFC would actually mean less
government involvement and a more efficient use of the already-earmarked
$700 billion than policymakers are talking about now.
The government would not need to interfere with
the private banking system, which could carry on as before. The Treasury
would not need to bail out the banks, which could be left to those same free
market forces that have served them so well up to now. If banks went
bankrupt, they could be put into
FDIC receivership and nationalized.
The government would then own a string of banks,
which could be used to service the depository and credit needs of the
community.
There would be no need to change the personnel
or procedures of these newly-nationalized banks. They could engage in
fractional reserve lending just as they do now. The only difference would
be that the interest on loans would return to the government, helping to
defray the tax burden on the populace; and the banks would start out with a
clean set of books, so their $700 billion in startup capital could be fanned
into $7 trillion in new loans.
This was the sort of banking scheme used in
Benjamin Franklins colony of Pennsylvania, where it worked brilliantly
well. The spiraling-interest problem was avoided by printing some extra
money and spending it into the economy for public purposes. During the
decades the provincial bank operated, the Pennsylvania colonists paid no
taxes, there was no government debt, and inflation did not result.7
Like the Pennsylvania bank, a modern-day federal banking system would not
actually need reserves at all. It is the sovereign right of a government
to issue the currency of the realm. What backs our money today is simply the
full faith and credit of the United States, something the United States
should be able to issue directly without having to draw on reserves of its
own credit.
But if Congress is not prepared to go that far,
a more efficient use of the earmarked $700 billion than bailing out
failing banks would be to designate the funds as the reserves for a
newly-reconstituted RFC.
Rather than creating a separate public banking corporation called the RFC,
the nations financial apparatus could be streamlined by simply
nationalizing
the privately-owned Federal Reserve; but again, Congress may
not be prepared to go that far. Since there is already successful precedent
for establishing an RFC in times like these, that model could serve as a
non-controversial starting point for a new public credit facility.
The G-7 nations financial planners, who met in
Washington D.C. this past weekend, appear intent on supporting the banking
system with enough government-debt-backed liquidity to produce what Jim
Rogers calls an inflationary holocaust.
As the U.S. private banking system
self-destructs, we need to ensure that a public credit system is in place
and ready to serve the peoples needs in its stead.
