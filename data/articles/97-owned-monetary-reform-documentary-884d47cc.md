97% owned present serious research and verifiable evidence on our economic
and financial system.
This is the first documentary to tackle this issue
from a UK-perspective and explains the inner workings of Central Banks and
the Money creation process.
When money drives almost all activity on the planet, it's essential that we
understand it.
Yet simple questions often get overlooked, questions like:
-
Where does money come from?
-
Who creates it?
-
Who decides how it gets used?
-
And what does this mean for the millions of ordinary people who suffer when
the monetary, and financial system, breaks down?
Produced by Queuepolitely and featuring,
-
Ben Dyson of Positive Money
-
Josh
Ryan-Collins of The New Economics Foundation
-
Ann Pettifor
-
the "HBOS
Whistleblower" Paul Moore

Political philosopher John Gray, commented,
"We're not moving to a world in
which crises will never happen or will happen less and less. We are in a
world in which they happen several times during a given human lifetime and I
think that will continue to be the case".
If you have decided that crisis as a result of the monetary system is not an
event you want to keep revisiting in your life-time then this documentary
will equip you with the knowledge you need, what you do with it is up to
you.
