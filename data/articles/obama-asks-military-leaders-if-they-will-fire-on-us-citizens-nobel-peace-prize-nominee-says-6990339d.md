Shock claim purported to come from "one of
Americas foremost military heroes"
Obama Removing All Military Leaders from Command
If They Will Not Fire on
U.S. Citizens
2009 Nobel Peace Prize nominee Jim Garrow
shockingly claims he was told by a top military veteran that the Obama
administrations litmus test for new military leaders is whether or not
they will obey an order to fire on U.S. citizens.
Garrow was nominated three years ago for the
prestigious Nobel Peace Prize and is the founder of The
Pink Pagoda Girls, an organization dedicated to rescuing baby girls from
gendercide in China.
Garrow has been personally involved in helping
rescue more than 36,000 Chinese baby girls from death.
He is a public
figure, not an anonymous voice on the Internet, which makes his claim all
the more disturbing.
I have just been informed by a former senior
military leader that Obama is using a new litmus test in determining who
will stay and who must go in his military leaders. Get ready to explode
folks. The new litmus test of leadership in the military is if they will
fire on US citizens or not.
"Those who will not are being removed, Garrow
wrote on his Facebook page, later following up the post by adding the
man who told him is, one of Americas foremost military heroes, whose goal
in divulging the information was to sound the alarm.
Garrows claim is even more explosive given that
the country is in the throes of a national debate about gun control, with
gun rights advocates keen to insist that the founders put the second
amendment in the Constitution primarily as a defense against government
tyranny.
It also follows reports
on Sunday that General James Mattis, head of the United States Central
Command,
is being told to vacate his office several months earlier than
planned.
Concerns over US troops being given orders to
fire on American citizens in the event of mass gun confiscation first arose
in 1995 when hundreds of Marines at 29 Palms, California were given
a survey as part of an academic project by Navy Lieutenant Commander
Ernest Guy Cunningham which asked the Marines if they would,
Fire upon U.S.
citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United
States government.
The survey was subsequently leaked because many
of the Marines who took it were shocked by the tone of the question.
The US Military has clearly outlined innumerable
civil emergency scenarios under which troops would be authorized to fire on
U.S. citizens.
In July 2012, the process by which this could
take place was made clear in a leaked US Army Military Police training
manual for Civil
Disturbance Operations dating from 2006. Similar plans were also
outlined in an updated
manual released in 2010 entitled "FM 3-39.40 Internment and Resettlement
Operations."
The 2006 document outlines how military assets
will be used to help local and state authorities to restore and maintain
law and order in the event of mass riots, civil unrest or a declaration of
martial law.
On page 20 of the manual, rules regarding the
use of deadly force in confronting dissidents on American soil are made
disturbingly clear with the directive that a, Warning shot will not be
fired.
Given that second
amendment advocates are now being depicted as 'dangerous terrorists' by
the federal government and local law enforcement, Garrows claim is sure to
stoke controversy given that Americans are seeing their gun rights
eviscerated while the federal government itself stockpiles
billions of bullets.
Last week, Gloversville Mayor Dayton King
warned that any federal gun confiscation program could
lead to a Waco-style standoff in rural areas of America.
Obama to Top Brass
Will you fire on American Citizens?
