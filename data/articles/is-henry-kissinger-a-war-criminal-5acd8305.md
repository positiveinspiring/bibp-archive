Thirty years after
the death of Charles Horman inspired a bestseller and an
Oscar-winning movie, his widow still pursues those she
believes are really to blame - including the former U.S.
secretary of state.
It's one reason the quest
for international justice
makes the United States so
nervous.
THE ACCUSED
Henry Alfred Kissinger, former U.S.
Secretary of state, national security adviser and Nobel laureate
THE ACCUSATIONS
Complicity in coup against
Chilean government plus the "killing, injury and displacement" of
three million people during Vietnam War.
CURRENT WHEREABOUTS
Head of Kissinger Associates,
Inc., international consulting firm in Washington.
It was a rainy day in spring when they brought
Charles Horman home.
The U.S. journalist and filmmaker had been abducted and killed after the
Chilean military overthrew president Salvador Allende in September,
1973. Six months later, his body arrived by plane in a crude wooden crate
with "Charles Horman from Santiago" scrawled on the side.
As the makeshift coffin was unloaded at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn,
N.Y., the driving rain washed the words away, sending trails of black ink
down the box. It was April 13, 1974.
Even before Mr. Horman's widow, Joyce, found herself standing in the rain
that day, she had vowed that no one would ever erase the memory of what had
been done to her husband.
She has been true to her word.
In the chaos that followed General Augusto Pinochet's decision to
depose Mr. Allende on Sept. 11, 1973, hundreds of the leftist president's
supporters were taken away to be tortured, beaten or killed.
Mr. Horman, an Allende sympathizer living in
Santiago, was one of them.
In the month that followed, Ms. Horman, then 29, and her father-in-law, Ed,
searched frantically for Mr. Horman - an ordeal dramatized in the
Oscar-winning 1982 film Missing, starring Sissy Spacek and Jack
Lemmon.
The movie ends when Joyce and Ed discover that Charles is dead, killed by
the military and his body hidden in a wall at a Santiago cemetery.
But Joyce Horman's search continues. For 28
years, she has struggled to track down those who killed the man she loved.
And the person at the center of her quest is none other than Henry Alfred
Kissinger.
A leading citizen of the world's most powerful nation, Mr. Kissinger
served as U.S. Secretary of state and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in
the same year as the coup in Chile. He was also national security adviser to
president Richard Nixon, and Ms. Horman believes that he and other U.S.
officials were deeply involved in the events that cost her husband his life.
It has been almost 30 years, and she doesn't seem bitter. At 57, she is
pleasant and straightforward, in her stylish glasses with owlish frames, and
has friends, a career and a social life. Nor does she seem obsessed with her
dead husband.
No photographs of him are to be seen in her
bright apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
Even so, the events of 1973 still cast a dark shadow. Asked what she misses
most about Charles, she dissolves into tears and then explains:
"He was intelligent, friendly, interesting -
he just loved life, and that's why his friends loved him."
Of course, nothing can replace the life she and
her husband might have had. All that she wants now, she says, is the simple
truth - and that leads to Mr. Kissinger.
"There's no way around him," she says. "He
is the most responsible person for the behavior of the U.S. government
in Chile at that time. He needs to be put on trial."
A few years ago, that would have seemed wildly
improbable. The armor of sovereign immunity protected all officials from the
acts they committed on government service, no matter how unsavory.
But the 1998 arrest of the man behind the coup, Gen. Pinochet, has knocked a
gaping hole in that armor Since then, a posse of victims, human-rights
activists and crusading prosecutors has tried to apply this "Pinochet
precedent" to others accused of mass killing, torture, abduction and war
crimes.
Mr. Kissinger is their biggest quarry yet, and they are getting closer all
the time.
Now, prosecutors in Chile, Argentina, Spain and
France want him to testify about what happened in Chile. Last month, a
Chilean judge staged a re-enactment of the Horman killing at Santiago's
National Stadium, and now wants Mr. Kissinger at least to answer written
questions about U.S. involvement in the coup.
Ms. Horman is thrilled, but she has a different reason for chasing the great
statesman:
"My main goal is to find out what happened
to Charles."
As author Thomas Hauser wrote in The
Execution of Charles Horman, the book that inspired the film Missing,
both Mr. Horman, the brilliant son of a New York industrial designer, and
Joyce, the lively daughter of a Minnesota grocer, had absorbed the questing,
skeptical spirit of the Sixties.
Mr. Horman covered the riots at the Democratic National Convention in 1968
for the liberal journal The Nation and made a film about napalm.
The couple had been married less than three years when, in 1971, they set
off in a camper van through Latin America. When they reached Santiago, they
decided to stay.
It was a heady time in Chile. Mr. Allende had come to power in 1970 and
brought in radical changes: land reform, wealth redistribution and the
nationalization of key industries. Mr. Horman began writing for a local
magazine that often attacked Mr. Nixon for undermining the Allende
government.
When the military stepped in, he was in the coastal city of Vina del Mar
with friend Terry Simon; they met two U.S. officers who seemed to know a lot
about the coup. Mr. Horman concluded that his country had plotted with Gen.
Pinochet, and made copious notes - which may have cost him his life.
Back in Santiago, essentially a war zone, he and his wife decided to return
to the States as soon as possible. But on Sept. 17, a light green truck
pulled up at their house, and a dozen soldiers carried out Mr. Horman and
armloads of papers and books. Ms. Horman wasn't home at the time, and never
saw her husband again.
The truck drove straight to the National Stadium, a clearinghouse for the
thousands of Chileans being rounded up. At least four dozen were killed
there - a first installment on the more than 3,000 killed during the
Pinochet regime.
Returning home to find the house in a shambles, Ms. Horman contacted the
U.S. Embassy seeking help. She got the run-around.
When she finally asked if the embassy could get
her into the stadium, a U.S. diplomat asked,
"What are you going to do, Mrs. Horman, look
under all the bleachers?"
For four weeks, she pounded the pavement,
meeting with anyone she thought might be able to help, while her
father-in-law, who had flown in from New York, visited hospitals and
morgues.
Finally, they got into the stadium.
A Chilean colonel led Ed Horman to a platform,
where he addressed the roughly 2,000 prisoners under guard in the stands.
"Charles Horman, this is your father," he
said. "If you are here, I would like you to take my word that it is safe
and come to me now."
His heart jumped when a young man ran forward,
but he realized that it was not his son.
"Right then," he said later, "I knew I'd
never see Charles again."
Five days later, an official of the Ford
Foundation, a U.S. philanthropic agency, told Mr. Horman he had learned from
a military contact that his only child,
"was executed in the National Stadium on
Sept. 20."
The next day, a U.S. official confirmed that
Charles's body had been found in a local morgue.
Two days later, Ms. Horman and her father-in-law
flew home, and it was then that her real struggle began.
She and her husband's parents brought a wrongful-death suit against the U.S.
Government and Mr. Kissinger, but it was dismissed for lack of evidence in
1978. The book followed, along with the Oscar-winning 1982 movie by director
Constantin Costa-Gavras.
By then Ms. Horman was struggling with an attack of lymphoma and she decided
she had to get on with her life.
For the next two decades, she worked as a computer and systems consultant
for the United Nations Development Program, the office of the Mayor of New
York, Oracle Corp. and others. She dated other men, but did not remarry.
Before the coup, she and her husband had planned to return to the United
States to raise a family. He would have turned 60 on May 15 (an occasion she
marked by holding a 20th anniversary party for Missing, with proceeds going
to the Charles Horman Truth Project).
She remained close to the Hormans, moving into the Manhattan building where
her husband grew up and helping to care for them as they aged. Ed Horman
died in 1993, followed last year by his wife, Elizabeth, at the age of 96.
Ms. Horman never gave up wondering about her husband's death, and in 1998 an
event gave her new hope. On Oct. 16, she turned on the news to hear that
Gen. Pinochet had been arrested in London on an extradition request from a
Spanish judge seeking to prosecute him. Exhilarated, she traveled to England
to join the attempt to persuade British courts to hand him over.
Eventually, the British government let him go
home for health reasons, but Gen. Pinochet's detention set a precedent that
galvanized the international justice movement.
Ms. Horman and her lawyers tried again to get the U.S. Government to release
classified documents relating to her husband's disappearance.
Finally, in 2000, it gave them the full results of two internal reviews of
the killing. Neither found any direct U.S. link, but one did uncover
"circumstantial evidence" that the Central Intelligence Agency,
"may have played an unfortunate part in
Horman's death."
It went on to say that,
"the government of Chile might have believed
this American could be killed without negative fallout from the U.S.
Government"
The second review said it was hard to believe
that the Chilean military would have killed Mr. Horman unless it had some
kind of signal from Washington.
Although tantalizing, the disclosures were not enough to reopen the
wrongful-death case. So Ms. Horman did some sleuthing on her own. Supported
by money from the Ford Foundation, she traveled to France, Switzerland,
Sweden, Chile and different parts of the United States to search for people
who might have some idea of how and why her husband was killed.
She gathered enough information to file a criminal complaint in Chile
against Gen. Pinochet and others in his circle. The case found its way to
Juan Guzman, the crusading judge who indicted the general for human-rights
crimes after his return from England and who managed to have his immunity to
prosecution lifted.
The General, now 86, escaped trial after a court found him mentally unfit,
but Judge Guzman is pushing ahead all the same. Last month, he arranged the
reenactment at the National Stadium, and last fall sent 17 questions about
the Horman abduction to Mr. Kissinger and other U.S. Officials So far, no
reply.
Joyce Horman believes U.S. Officials tipped off friends in the Chilean
military that her husband had found evidence of U.S. Involvement while in
Viña del Mar. Rafael Gonzalez, a disgruntled Chilean intelligence
agent, told reporters in the 1970s that the army's head of intelligence,
Gen. Augusto Lutz, decided that Mr. Horman "knew too much," and an
American military officer was in the room at the time.
Ms. Horman hopes to track down that man.
"I want to find out exactly what happened to
Charlie: who picked him up, why they picked him up, who questioned him,
how they came to decide he had to disappear."
Those questions lead her straight to Mr.
Kissinger who, as well as being national security adviser, led the
high-level "40 committee" that helped to oversee U.S. intelligence efforts.
Even if he played no direct role in her husband's death, she believes he
knew how and why it happened.
"Kissinger rolled up his sleeves in Chile...
He went down to talk to Pinochet after the coup. I mean, for heaven's
sake, how obnoxious."
Mr. Kissinger, now 79, denies everything. He
refused to return calls for this article, but has said he knows nothing
about the Horman case.
"If it were brought to my attention, I would
have done something," he told The New York Times.
He also denies any role in the coup.
In his books, he admits he took a dim view of
Mr. Allende and joined a U.S. effort to have him overthrown, but aborted it
as a lost cause. He met Gen. Pinochet, he says, to tell him to pay attention
to calls from the U.S. Congress for an end to political repression.
But Mr. Kissinger also has others on his trail. Last May, a French judge
sent the police to his Paris hotel to ask him to appear at the Justice
Ministry the next day and answer questions about five French citizens who
disappeared after the Chilean coup. Instead, Mr. Kissinger promptly left
town.
That same month, an Argentine judge said he wanted Mr. Kissinger to testify
about American involvement in Operation Condor, the scheme by South American
dictatorships, including Argentina and Chile, to abduct or kill opponents
living in exile.
In April, a British human-rights campaigner asked a London judge to arrest
Mr. Kissinger under the Geneva Conventions Act of 1957 for the "killing,
injury and displacement" of three million people in Indochina during the
Vietnam War years. The judge rejected the application, but not before Mr.
Kissinger had to endure a protest by 200 activists calling him an "evil war
criminal."
Plans for a similar protest apparently led him
to cancel a planned trip to Brazil as well.
Finally, in Washington, Mr. Kissinger faces a $3-million (U.S.) lawsuit by
the family of René Schneider, a Chilean general assassinated in 1970 for
opposing plans for a coup against Mr. Allende.
This quickening pace of the pursuit raises a touchy issue for international
justice: Whose justice is it?
Until now, those brought to trial largely have come from poor or defeated
countries such as Serbia and Rwanda. But activists say that must change.
To have any force, international law must apply
to the rich and powerful too.
"If the drive to put Kissinger in the
witness box, let alone the dock, should succeed, then it would rebut the
taunt about 'victor's justice' in war-crimes trials," writes British
journalist Christopher Hitchens, who asserts in his book
The Trial of Henry Kissinger (see
the video) there are grounds for an
indictment.
"It would demonstrate that no person, and no
society or state, is above the law. Conversely, if the initiative should
fail, then it would seem to be true that we have woven a net for the
catching of small fish only."
But Mr. Kissinger is one fish the United States
does not want on anyone's hook.
The attempts to arrest or even question him
touch off Washington's worst fears about the evolving movement for
international justice.
Just last month, the administration of President
George W. Bush declared it would have nothing to do with the
world's first permanent war-crimes tribunal, the International Criminal
Court. If foreign judges could second-guess their every decision, U.S.
officials argue, it would be open season on the United States.
The man making that argument most forcefully perhaps has the most to lose:
Mr. Kissinger himself.
"Nobody can say that I served in an
administration that did not make mistakes," he said in London in April.
"It is quite possible that mistakes were
made, but that is not the issue. The issue is, 30 years after the event,
whether the courts are the appropriate means by which this determination
is made."
In his book Does America Need a Foreign
Policy?, he holds that, in theory, any court anywhere can try a person
accused of crimes against humanity.
"When discretion on what crimes are subject
to universal jurisdiction and whom to prosecute is left to national
prosecutors, the scope for arbitrariness is wide indeed," he argues.
None of this cuts much ice with Joyce Horman.
She argues that the officials of a democratic nation like the United States
must be accountable for their actions.
If that takes a foreign prosecutor, so be it.
"The American military and the American
government have an incredible amount of power and the abuse of that
power was typified by the Chilean coup," she says.
"For Americans to be bumping off Americans
in foreign lands is not what American citizens want their government to
be doing."
