Section II
A CRASH COURSE ON MONEY
The eight chapters contained in this and the following section deal with
material that is organized by topic, not chronology. Several of them will
jump ahead of events that are not covered until later.
Furthermore, the
scope is such that the reader may wonder what, if any, is the connection
with the Federal Reserve System. Please be patient.
The importance will
eventually become clear. It is the author's intent to cover concepts and
principles before looking at events. Without this background, the history of
the Federal Reserve is boring. With it, the story emerges as an exciting
drama which profoundly affects our lives today.
So let us begin this
adventure with a few discoveries about the nature of money itself.

THE BARBARIC METAL
The history and evolution of money; the emergence of gold as the universal
money supply; the attempts by governments to cheat their subjects by
clipping or debasing gold coins; the reality that arty quantity of gold will
suffice for a monetary system and that "more money" does not require more
gold.
There is a great mystique surrounding the nature of money.
It is generally
regarded as beyond the understanding of mere mortals. Questions of the
origin of money or the mechanism of its creation are seldom matters of
public debate. We accept them as facts of life which are beyond our sphere
of control.
Thus, in a nation which is founded on the principle of
government by the people, and which assumes a high level of understanding
among the electorate, the people themselves have blocked out one of the most
important factors affecting, not only their government, but their personal
lives as well.
This attitude is not accidental, nor was it always so.
There was a time in
the fairly recent past when the humble voter - even without formal education
- was well informed on money matters and vitally concerned about their
political implementation. In fact, as we shall see in a later chapter, major
elections were won or lost depending on how candidates stood on the issue of
a central bank. It has been in the interest of the money mandarins, however,
to convince the public that, now, these issues are too complicated for
novices.
Through the use of technical jargon and by hiding simple reality
inside a maze of bewildering procedures, they have caused ar* understanding
of the nature of money to fade from the public consciousness.
WHAT IS MONEY?
The first step in this maneuver was to
scramble the definition of money
itself.
For example, the July 20, 1975 issue of the New York
Times, in an article entitled "Money Supply: A Growing Muddle/' begins with
the question:
"What is money nowadays?"
The Wall Street Journal of August
29,1975, comments:
"The men and women involved in this arcane exercise [of
watching the money supply] ... aren't exactly sure what the money supply
consists of."
And, in its September 24,1971 issue, the same paper said:
"A
pro-International Monetary Fund Seminar of eminent economists couldn't agree
on what money is or how banks create it."
Even the government cannot define money. Some years ago, a Mr.
A.F. Davis
mailed a ten-dollar Federal Reserve Note to the Treasury Department.
In his
letter of transmittal, he called attention to the inscription on the bill
which said that it was redeemable in "lawful money," and then requested that
such money be sent to him. In reply, the Treasury merely sent two
five-dollar bills from a different printing series bearing a similar promise
to pay.
Mr. Davis responded:
Dear Sir
Receipt is hereby acknowledged of two $5.00 United States notes, which we
interpret from your letter are to be considered as lawful money. Are we to
infer from this that the Federal Reserve notes are not lawful money?
I am enclosing one of the $5.00 notes which you sent to me. I note that it
states on the face, "The United States of America will pay to the bearer on
demand five dollars."
I am hereby demanding five dollars.
One week later, Mr. Davis received the following reply from Acting
Treasurer, M.E. Slindee:
Dear Mr. Davis:
Receipt is acknowledged of your letter of December 23rd, transmitting one
$5. United States Note with a demand for payment of five dollars. You are
advised that the term "lawful money" has not been defined in federal
legislation...
The term "lawful currency" no longer has such special
significance. The $5 United States Note received with your letter of
December 23rd is returned herewith.
The phrases "...will pay to the bearer on demand" and "...is redeemable in
lawful money" were deleted from our currency altogether in 1964.
Is money really so mysterious that it cannot be defined? Is it the coin and
currency we have in our pockets? Is it numbers in a checking account or
electronic impulses in a computer? Does it include the balance in a savings
account or the available credit on a charge card? Does it include the value
of stocks and bonds, houses, land, or personal possessions? Or is money
nothing more than purchasing power?
The main function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the supply of money.
Yet, if no one is able to define what money is, how can we have an opinion
about how the System is performing? The answer, of course, is that we
cannot, and that is exactly the way the cartel wants it.
The reason the Federal Reserve appears to be a complicated subject is
because most discussions start somewhere in the middle. By the time we get
into it, definitions have been scrambled and basic concepts have been
assumed. Under such conditions, intellectual chaos is inevitable. If we
start at the beginning, however, and deal with each concept in sequence from
the general to the specific, and if we agree on definitions as we go, we
shall find to our amazement that the issues are really quite simple.
Furthermore, the process is not only painless, it is - believe it or not -
intensely interesting.
The purpose of this and the next three chapters, therefore, is to provide
what could be called a crash course on money. It will not be complicated. In
fact, you already know much of what follows. All we shall attempt to do is
tie it all together so that it will have continuity and relativity to our
subject. When you are through with these next few pages, you will understand
money. That's a promise.
So, lets get started with the basics.
What is money?
A WORKING DEFINITION
The dictionary is of little help. If economists cannot agree on what money
is, it is partly due to the fact that there are so many definitions
available that it is difficult to insist that any of them is the obvious
choice.
For the purpose of our analysis, however, it will be necessary to
establish one definition so we can at least know what is meant when the word
is used within this text.
To that end, we shall introduce our own definition
which has been assembled from bits and dabs taken from numerous sources.
The structure is designed, not to reflect what we think money ought to be or
to
support the view of any particular school of economics, but simply to reduce
the concept to its most fundamental essence and to reflect the reality of
today's world. It is not necessary to agree or disagree with this
definition. It is introduced solely for the purpose of providing an
understanding of the word as it is used within these pages.
This, then,
shall be our working definition:
Money is anything which is accepted as a medium of exchange and it may be
classified into the following forms:
1. Commodity money Z Receipt money
3. Fiat money
4. Fractional money
Understanding the difference between these forms of money is practically all
we need to know to fully comprehend the Federal Reserve System and to come
to a judgment regarding its value to our economy and to our nation. Let us,
therefore, examine each of them in some detail.
BARTER (PRE-MONEY)
Before there was any kind of money, however, there was barter, and it is
important first to understand the link between the two. Barter is defined as
that which is directly exchanged for something of like value.
Mr. Jones
swaps his restored Model-T Ford for a Steinway grand piano.1
1. Strictly speaking, each party holds
the value of what he is receiving to be more than what he is giving.
Otherwise he would not make the trade. In the mind of the traders,
therefore, the items have unequal value. That opinion is shared equally by
them both. The shorter explanation, however, is less unwieldy.
This exchange
is not monetary in nature because both items are valued for themselves
rather than held as a medium of exchange to be used later for something
else.
Note, however, that both items have intrinsic value or they would not
be accepted by the other parties. Labor also may be exchanged as barter when
it, too, is perceived to have intrinsic value to the person for whom the
labor is performed.
The concept of intrinsic value is the key to an
understanding of the various forms of money that evolved from the process of
barter.
COMMODITY MONEY
In the natural evolution of every society, there always have been one or two
items which became more commonly used in barter than all others.
This was
because they had certain characteristics which made them useful or
attractive to almost everyone. Eventually, they were traded, not for
themselves, but because they represented a storehouse of value which could
be exchanged at a later time for something else.
At that point, they ceased
being barter and became true money. They were, according to our working
definition, a medium of exchange. And, since that medium was a commodity of
intrinsic value, it may be described as commodity money.
Among primitive people, the most usual item to become commodity money was
some form of food, either produce or livestock. Lingering testimony to this
fact is our word pecuniary, which means pertaining to money. It is derived
from the word pecunia, which is the Latin word for cow.
But, as society progressed beyond the level of bare existence, items other
than food came into general demand. Ornaments were occasionally prized when
the food supply was ample, and there is evidence of some societies using
colored sea shells and unusual stones for this purpose.
But these never
seriously challenged the use of cattle, or sheep, or corn, or wheat, because
these staples possessed greater intrinsic value for themselves even if they
were not used as money.
METALS AS MONEY
Eventually, when man learned how to refine crude ores and to craft them into
tools or weapons, the metals themselves became of value.
This was the
dawning of the Bronze Age in which iron, copper, tin, and bronze were traded
between craftsmen and merchants along trade routes and at major sea ports.
The value of metal ingots was originally determined by weight. Then, as it
became customary for the merchants who cast them to stamp the uniform
weights on the top, they eventually were valued simply by counting their
number. Although they were too large to carry in a pouch, they were still
small enough to be transported easily and, in this form, they became, in
effect, primitive but fractional coins.
The primary reason metals became widely used as commodity money is that they
meet all of the requirements for convenient fading.
In addition to being of
intrinsic value for uses other than money, they are not perishable, which is
more than one can say for cows; by melting and reforming they can be divided
into smaller units and conveniently used for purchases of minor items, which
is not possible with diamonds, for example; and, because they are not in
great abundance, small quantities carry high value, which means they are
more portable than such items as timber, for example.
Perhaps the most important monetary attribute of metals, however, is their
ability to be precisely measured. It is important to keep in mind that, in
its fundamental form and function, money is both a storehouse and a measure
of value. It is the reference by which all other things in the economy can
be compared. It is essential, therefore, that the monetary unit itself be
both measurable and constant.
The ability to precisely assay metals in both
purity and weight makes them ideally suited for this function. Experts may
haggle over the precise quality of a gems tone, but an ingot of metal is
either 99% pure or it isn't, and it either weighs 100 ounces or it doesn't.
One's opinion has little to do with it. It is not without reason, therefore,
that, on every continent and throughout history, man has chosen metals as
the ideal storehouse and measure of value.
THE SUPREMACY OF GOLD
There is one metal, of course, that has been selected by centuries of trial
and error above all others.
Even today, in a world where money can no longer
be defined, the common man instinctively knows that gold will do just fine
until something better comes along. We shall leave it to the sociologists to
debate why gold has been chosen as the universal money. For our purposes, it
is only important to know that it has been. But we should not overlook the
possibility that it was an excellent choice.
As for quantity, there seems to
be just the right amount to keep its value high enough for useful coinage.
It is less plentiful than silver - which, incidentally, has run a close
second in the monetary contest - and more abundant than platinum. Either
could have served the purpose quite well, but gold has provided what appears
to be the perfect compromise.
Furthermore, it is a commodity in great demand
for purposes other than money. It is sought for both industry and ornament,
thus assuring its intrinsic value under all conditions.
And, of course, its
purity and weight can be precisely measured.
THE MISLEADING THEORY OF QUANTITY
It often is argued that gold is inappropriate as money because it is too
limited in supply to satisfy the needs of modern commerce.
On the surface,
that may sound logical - after all, we do need a lot of money out there to
keep the wheels of the economy turning - but, upon examination, this turns
out to be one of the most childish ideas imaginable.
First of all, it is estimated that approximately 45% of all the gold mined
throughout the world since the discovery of America is now in government or
banking stockpiles.1
1. See Elgin Groseclose, Money and Man:
A survey of Monetary Experience, 4th ed. (Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma
Press, 1976), p. 259.
There undoubtedly is at least an additional 30% in
jewelry, ornaments, and private hoards. Any commodity which exists to the
extent of 75% of its total world production since Columbus discovered
America can hardly be described as in short supply.
The deeper reality, however, is that the supply is not even important.
Remember that the primary function of money is to measure the value of the
items for which it is exchanged. In this sense, it serves as a yardstick or
ruler of value. It really makes no difference if we measure the length of
our rug in inches, feet, yards, or meters. We could even manage it quite
well in miles if we used decimals and expressed the result in millimiles.
We
could even use multiple rulers, but no matter what measurement we use, the
reality of what we are measuring does not change. Our rug does not become
larger just because we have increased the quantity of measurement units by
painting additional markers onto our rulers.
If the supply of gold in relation to the supply of available goods is so
small that a one-ounce coin would be too valuable for minor transactions,
people simply would use half-ounce coins or tenth-ounce coins. The amount of
gold in the world does not affect its ability to serve as money, it only
affects the quantity that will be used to measure any given transaction.
Let us illustrate the point by imagining that we are playing a game of
Monopoly.
Each person has been given a starting supply of
play money with
which to transact business. It doesn't take long before we all begin to feel
the shortage of cash. If we just had more Money, we could really wheel and
deal. Let us suppose further that someone discovers another game-box of
Monopoly sitting in the closet and proposes that the currency from that be
added to the game under progress.
By general agreement, the little bills are distributed equally
among all players. What would happen?
The money supply has now been doubled. We all have twice as much money as we
did a moment before. But would we be any better off? There is no
corresponding increase in the quantity of property, so everyone would bid up
the prices of existing pieces until they became twice as expensive. In other
words, the law of supply and demand would rapidly seek exactly the same
equilibrium as existed with the more limited money supply.
When the quantity
of money expands without a corresponding increase in goods, the effect is a
reduction in the purchasing power of each monetary unit. In other words,
nothing really changes except that the quoted price of everything goes up.
But that is merely the quoted price, the price as expressed in terms of the
monetary unit. In truth, the real price, in terms of its relationship to all
other prices, remains the same. It's merely that the relative value of the
money supply has gone down.
This, of course, is the classic mechanism of
inflation. Prices do not go up. The value of the money goes down.
If Santa Claus were to visit everyone on Earth next Christmas and leave in
our stockings an amount of money exactly equal to the amount we already had,
there is no doubt that many would rejoice over the sudden increase in
wealth. By New Year's day, however, prices would have doubled for
everything, and the net result on the world's standard of living would be
exactly zero.1
1. Those who rushed to market first, however, would benefit temporarily from
old prices. Under inflation, those who save are punished.
The reason so many people fall for the appealing argument that the economy
needs a larger money supply is that they zero in only on the need to
increase their supply. If they paused for a moment to reflect on the
consequences of the total supply increasing, the nonsense of the proposal
becomes immediately apparent.
Murray Rothbard, professor of economics at the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas, says:
We come to the startling truth that it doesn't matter what the supply of
money is. Any supply will do as well as any other supply.
The free market
will simply adjust by changing the purchasing power, of effectiveness, of
its gold-unit. There is no need whatever for any planned increase in the
money supply, for the supply to rise to offset any condition, or to follow
any artificial criteria.
More money does not supply more capital, is not
more productive, does not permit "economic growth." 1

Colorado: Pine Tree Press, 1964), p. 13.
GOLD GUARANTEES PRICE STABILITY
The Federal Reserve claims that one of its primary objectives is to
stabilize prices.
In this, of course, it has failed miserably. The irony,
however, is that maintaining stable prices is the easiest thing in the
world. All we have to do is stop tinkering with the money supply and let the
free market do its job. Prices become automatically stable under a commodity
money system, and this is particularly true under a gold standard.
Economists like to illustrate the workings of the marketplace by creating
hypothetical micro and macro economies in which everything is reduced to
only a few factors and a few people. In that spirit, therefore, let us
create a hypothetical economy consisting of only two classes of people: gold
miners and tailors. Let us suppose that the law of supply and demand has
settled on the value of one ounce of gold to be equal to a fine,
custom-tailored suit of clothes.
That means that the labor, tools,
materials, and talent required to mine and refine one ounce of gold are
equally traded for the labor, tools, and talent required to weave and tailor
the suit. Up until now, the number of ounces of gold produced each year have
been roughly equal to the number of fine suits made each year, so prices
have remained stable.
The price of a suit is one ounce of gold, and the
value of one ounce of gold is equal to one finely-tailored suit.
Let us now suppose that the miners, in their quest for a better standard of
living, work extra hours and produce more gold this year than previously -
or that they discover a new lode of gold which greatly increases the
available supply with little extra effort. Now things are no longer in
balance. There are more ounces of gold than there are suits.
The result of
this expansion of the money supply over and above the supply of available
goods is the same as m our game of Monopoly. The quoted prices of the suits
go up because the relative value of the gold has gone down.
The process does not end there, however. When the miners see that they are no
better off than before in spite of the extra work, and especially when they
see the tailors making a greater profit for no increase in labor, some of
them decide to put down their picks and turn to the trade of tailoring.
In other words, they are responding to the law of
supply and demand in labor.
When this happens, the annual production of gold
goes down while the production of suits goes up, and an equilibrium is
reached once again in which suits and gold are traded as before. The free
market, if unfettered by politicians and money mechanics, will always
maintain a stable price structure which is automatically regulated by the
underlying factor of human effort.
The human effort required to extract one
ounce of gold from the earth will always be approximately equal to the
amount of human effort required to provide the goods and services for which
it is freely exchanged.
CIGARETTES AS MONEY
A perfect example of how commodities tend to self-regulate their value
occurred in Germany at the end of World War II.
The German mark had become
useless, and barter was common. But one item of exchange, namely cigarettes,
actually became a commodity money, and they served quite well.
Some
cigarettes were smuggled into the country, but most of them were brought in
by U.S. servicemen. In either case, the quantity was limited and the demand
was high. A single cigarette was considered small change.
A package of
twenty and a carton of two hundred served as larger units of currency. If
the exchange rate began to fall too low - in other words, if the quantity of
cigarettes tended to expand at a rate faster than the expansion of other
goods - the holders of the currency, more than likely, would smoke some of
it rather than spend it.
The supply would diminish and the value would
return to its previous equilibrium. That is not theory, it actually
happened.1
1. See Galbraith, p. 250.
With gold as the monetary base, we would expect that improvements in
manufacturing technology would gradually reduce the cost of production,
causing, not stability, but a downward movement of all prices. That downward
pressure, however, is partially offset by an increase in the cost of the
more sophisticated tools that are required.
Furthermore, similar
technological efficiencies are being applied in the field of mining, so
everything tends to balance out. History has shown that changes in this
natural equilibrium are minimal and occur only gradually over a long period
of time. For example, in 1913, the year the Federal Reserve was enacted into
law, the average annual wage in America was $633 - exchange value of gold
that year was $20.67.
That means that the average worker earned the
equivalent of 30.6 ounces of gold per year.
In 1990, the average annual wage had risen to $20,468. That is a whopping
increase of 3,233 per cent, an average rise of 42 per cent each year for 77
years. But the exchange value of gold in 1990 had also risen. It was at
$386.90 per ounce. The average worker, therefore, was earning the equivalent
of 52.9 ounces of gold per year.
That is an increase of only 73 per cent, a
rise of less than 1 per cent per year over that same period. It is obvious
that the dramatic increase in the size of the paycheck was meaningless to
the average American. The reality has been a small but steady increase in
purchasing power (about 1 per cent per year) that has resulted from the
gradual improvement in technology.
This and only this has improved the
standard of living and brought down real prices - as revealed by the
relative value of gold.
In areas where personal service is the primary factor and where technology
is less important, the stability of gold as a measure of value is even more
striking. At the Savoy Hotel in London, one gold sovereign will still buy
dinner for three, exactly as it did in 1913. And, in ancient Rome, the cost
of a finely made toga, belt, and pair of sandals was one ounce of gold.
That
is almost exactly the same cost today, two-thousand years later, for a
hand-crafted suit, belt, and a pair of dress shoes. There are no central
banks or other human institutions which could even come close to providing
that kind of price stability. And, yet, it is totally automatic under a gold
standard.
In any event, before leaving the subject of gold, we should acknowledge that
there is nothing mystical about it. It is merely a commodity which, because
it has intrinsic value and possesses certain qualities, has become accepted
throughout history as a Medium of exchange. Hitler waged a campaign against
gold as a tool of the Jewish bankers. But the Nazis traded heavily in gold
and largely financed their war machine with it.
Lenin claimed that gold was used only to keep
the workers in bondage and that, after the solution, it
would be used to cover the floors of public lavatories, ^e Soviet Union
under Communism became one of the world's biggest producers and users of
gold.
Economist John Maynard
Keynes once dismissed gold as a "barbaric metal." Many followers of Keynes
today are heavily invested in gold. It is entirely possible of course, that
something other than gold would be better as the basis for money.
It's just
that, in over two thousand years, no one has been able to find it.
NATURAL LAW NO. 1
The amazing stability of gold as a measure of value is simply the result of
human nature reacting to the forces of supply and demand.
The process,
therefore, may be stated as a natural law of human behavior:
LESSON: When gold (or silver) is used as money and when the forces of supply
and demand are not thwarted by government intervention, the amount of new
metal added to the money supply will always be closely proportional to the
expanding services and goods which can be purchased with it. Long-term
stability of prices is the dependable result of these forces. This process
is automatic and impartial. Any attempt by politicians to intervene will
destroy the benefit for all. Therefore,
LAW: Long-term price stability is possible only when the money supply is
based upon the gold (or silver) supply without government interference.
As the concept of money was slowly developing in the mind of ancient man, it
became obvious that one of the advantages of using gold or silver as the
medium of exchange was that, because of their rarity as compared to copper
or iron, great value could be represented by small size.
Tiny ingots could
be carried in a pouch or fastened to a belt for ease of transportation And,
of course, they could be more readily hidden for safekeeping. Goldsmiths
then began to fashion them into round discs and to put their stamps on them
to attest to purity and weight. In this way, the world's first coins began
to make their appearance.
It is believed that the first precious metal coins were minted by the
Lydians in Asia Minor (now Northwest Turkey), in about 600 B.C. The Chinese
used gold cubes as early as 2100 B.C. But it wasn't until the kings stepped
into the picture that true coinage became a reality. It was only when the
state certified the tiny discs that they became widely accepted, and it is
to the Greeks more than anyone that we owe this development.
Groseclose
describes the result:
These light shining discs, adorned with curious new emblems and a variety of
vigorous, striking images, made a deep impression on both Greek and
barbarian.
And to the more practical minded, the abundance of uniform pieces
of metal, each of a standard weight, certified by the authority of the
state, meant a release from the cumbersomeness of barter and new and
dazzling opportunities in every direction...
All classes of men succumbed to money, and those who had formerly been
content to produce only for their needs and the necessities of the
household, found themselves going to the market place with their handicraft,
or the fruits of their toil, to exchange them for the coins they might
obtain.1
1. Groseclose, Money and Man, p. 13.
EXPANDING THE MONEY SUPPLY BY COIN CLIPPING
From the very beginning, the desire for a larger money supply led to
practices which were destructive to the economy.
Unscrupulous merchants
began to shave off a tiny portion of each coin they handled - a process
known as coin clipping - and then having the shavings melted down into new
coins. Before long, the king's treasury began to do the same thing to the
coins it received in taxes. In this way, the money supply was increased, but
the supply of gold was not.
The result was exactly what we now know always
happens when the money supply is artificially expanded. There was inflation.
Whereas one coin previously would buy twelve sheep, now it would only be
accepted for ten. The total amount of gold needed for twelve sheep never
really changed. It's just that everyone knew that one coin no longer
contained it.
As governments became more brazen in their debasement of the currency, even
to the extent of diluting the gold or silver content, the population adapted
quite well by simply "discounting" the new coins. That is to say, they
accepted them at a realistic value, which was lower than what the government
had intended. This was, as always, reflected in a general rise in prices
quoted in terms of those coins. Real prices, in terms of labor or other
goods or ^en of gold itself remained unchanged.
Governments do not like to be thwarted in their plans to exploit their
subjects. So a way had to be found to force people to accept these slugs as
real money. This led to the first legal-tender laws.
By royal decree, the
"coin of the realm," was declared legal for the settlement of all
debts.
Anyone who refused it at face value was subject to
fine, imprisonment, or, in some cases, even death. The result was that the
good coins disappeared from circulation and went into private hoards. After
all, if the government forces you to accept junk at the same rate of
exchange as gold, wouldn't you keep the gold and spend the junk?
That is
what happened in America in the '60s when the mint began to issue cheap
metal tokens to replace the silver dimes, quarters, and half-dollars. Within
a few months, the silver coins were in dresser drawers and safe-deposit
boxes. The same thing has happened repeatedly throughout antiquity.
In
economics, that is called
Gresham's Law:
"Bad money drives out good."
The final move in this game of legal plunder was for the government to fix
prices so that, even if everyone is using only junk as money, they can no
longer compensate for the continually expanding supply of it. Now the people
were caught. They had no escape except to become criminals, which most of
them, incidentally, chose to do.
The history of artificially expanding money
is the history of great dissatisfaction with government, much lawlessness,
and a massive underground economy.
GOLD IS THE ENEMY OF THE WELFARE STATE
In more modern times, rulers of nations have become more sophisticated in
the methods by which they debase the currency.
Instead of clipping coins, it
is done through the banking system The consequences of that process were
summarized in 1966 by Alan Greenspan who, a few years later, would became
Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.
Greenspan wrote:
The abandonment of the gold standard made it possible for the welfare
statists to use the banking system as a means to an unlimited expansion of
credit....
The law of supply and demand is not to be conned. As the supply of money (of
claims) increases relative to the supply of tangible assets in the economy,
prices must eventually rise.
Thus the earnings saved by the productive
members of the society lose value in terms of goods When the economy's books
are finally balanced, one finds that this loss in value represents the goods
purchased by the government for welfare or other purposes...
In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from
confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there
were, the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in
the case of gold... The financial policy of the welfare state requires that
there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves.
This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists' tirades against gold.
Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the "hidden" confiscation of wealth.
Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector
of property rights.1
Unfortunately, when Greenspan was appointed as Chairman of Federal Reserve
System, he became silent on the issue of gold. Once he was seated at the
control panel which holds the levers of power, he served the statists well
as they continued to confiscate the people's wealth through the hidden tax
of inflation.
Even the wisest of men can be corrupted by power and wealth.
REAL COMMODITY MONEY IN HISTORY
Returning to the topic of debasing the currency in ancient times, it must be
stated that such practices were by no means universal.
There are many
examples throughout history of regents and kingdoms which used great
restraint in money creation. Ancient Greece, where coinage was first
developed, is one of them. The drachma became the defacto monetary unit of
the civilized world because of the dependability of its gold content. Within
its borders, cities flourished and trade abounded.
Even after the fall of
Athens in the Peloponnesian War, her coinage remained, for centuries, as the
standard by which all others were measured.2

wad, ed. Ayn Rand (New York: Signet Books, 1967), p. 101.
2. Even the Greeks, under Solon, had
one, brief experience with a debased currency. But it was
short lived, and never repeated - See Groseclose, Money and Man, PP-14,20-54.
Perhaps the greatest example of a nation with sound money, however, was the
Byzantine Empire.
Building on the sound monetary tradition of Greece, the
emperor Constantine ordered the creation of a new gold piece called the
solidus and a silver piece called the miliarense. The gold weight of the
solidus soon became fixed at 65 grains and was minted at that standard for
the next eight-hundred years. Its quality was so dependable that it was
freely accepted, under the name bezant, from China to Brittany, from the
Baltic Sea to Ethiopia.
Byzantine laws regarding money were strict. Before being admitted to the
profession of banking, the candidate had to have sponsors who would attest
to his character, that he would not file
or chip either the solidi or the miliarensia, and that he would not issue
false coin.
Violation of these rules called for cutting off a hand.1
It is an amazing fact of history that the Byzantine Empire flourished as the
center of world commerce for eight-hundred years without falling into
bankruptcy nor, for that matter, even into debt. Not once during this period
did it devalue its money.
"Neither the ancient nor the modern world," says
Heinrich Gelzer, "can offer a complete parallel to this phenomenon. This
prodigious stability...secured the bezant as universal currency. On account
of its full weight, it passed with all the neighboring nations as a valid
medium of exchange. By her money, Byzantium controlled both the civilized
and the barbarian worlds".2

BAD COMMODITY MONEY IN HISTORY
The experience of the Romans was quite different. Basically a militaristic
people, they had little patience for the niceties of monetary restraint.
Especially in the later Empire, debasement of the coinage became a
deliberate state policy. Every imaginable means for plundering the people
was devised. In addition to taxation, coins were clipped, reduced, diluted,
and plated. Favored groups were given franchises for state-endorsed
monopolies, the origin of our present-day corporation.
And, amidst
constantly rising prices in terms of constantly expanding money, speculation
and dishonesty became rampant.
By the year 301 A.D., mutiny was developing in the army, remote regions were
displaying disloyalty, the treasury was empty, agriculture depressed, and
trade almost at a standstill. It was then that Diocletian issued his famous
price-fixing proclamation as the last measure of a desperate emperor. We are
struck by the similarity to such proclamations in our own time. Most of the
chaos can be traced directly to government policy.
Yet, the politicians
point the accusing finger at everyone else for their "greed" and "disregard
for the common good."
Diocletian declared:
Who is of so hardened a heart and so untouched by a feeling of humanity that
he can be unaware, nay that he has not noticed, that in the sale of wares
which are exchanged in the market, or dealt with in the daily business of
the cities, an exorbitant tendency in prices has spread to such an extent
that the unbridled desire of plundering is held in check neither by
abundance nor by seasons of plenty...
Inasmuch as there is seen only a mad
desire without control, to pay no heed to the needs of the many - it seems
good to us, as we look into the future, to us who are the fathers of the
people, that justice intervene to settle matters impartially.1

As quoted by Grosedose, Money and Man, pp. 43-44.
What followed was an incredibly detailed list of mandated prices for
everything from a serving of beer or a bunch of watercress to a lawyer's fee
and a bar of gold.
The result? Conditions became even worse, and the royal
decree was rescinded five years later.
The Roman Empire never recovered from the crisis. By the fourth century, all
coins were weighed, and the economy was slipping back into barter again. By
the seventh century, the weights themselves had been so frequently changed
that it was no longer possible to effect an exchange in money at all.
For
all practical purposes, money became extinct, and the Roman Empire was no
more.
RECEIPT MONEY
When new civilizations rose from the ruins of Rome, they reclaimed the lost
discovery of money and used it to great advantage.
The invention was truly a
giant step forward for mankind, but there were many problems yet to be
solved and much experimentation lay ahead. The development of paper money
was a case in point. When a man accumulated more coins than he required for
daily purchases, he needed a safe place to store them.
The goldsmiths, who handled large amounts of
precious metals in their trades, had already built sturdy vaults to protect
their own inventory, so it was natural for them to offer vault space *o
their customers for a fee. The goldsmith could be trusted to guard the coins well because he also would be guarding his own
health.
When the coins were placed into the vault, the warehouseman Would give the
owner a written receipt which entitled him to withdraw at any time.
At first, the only way the coins could be taken from
the vault was for the owner to personally present the receipt.
Eventually,
however, it became customary for the owner to merely endorse his receipt to
a third party who, upon presentation, could make the withdrawal. These
endorsed receipts were the forerunners of today's checks.
The final stage in this development was the custom of issuing, not just one
receipt for the entire deposit, but a series of smaller receipts, adding up
to the same total, and each having printed across the top:
PAY TO THE BEAKER
ON DEMAND.
As the population learned from experience that these paper
receipts were truly backed by good coin in the goldsmith's warehouse and
that the coin really would be given out in exchange for the receipts, it
became increasingly common to use the paper instead of the coin
Thus, receipt money came into existence. The paper itself was useless, but
what it represented was quite valuable.
As long as the coin was held in safe
keeping as promised, there was no difference in value between the receipt
and the coin which backed it. And, as we shall see in the next chapter,
there were notable examples of the honest use of receipt money at the very
beginning of the development of banking. When the receipt was scrupulously
honored, the economy moved forward.
When it was used as a gimmick for the
artificial expansion of the money supply, the economy convulsed and
stagnated.
NATURAL LAW NO. 2
This is not a textbook on the history of money, so we cannot afford the
luxury of lingering among the fascinating details.
For our purposes, it is
sufficient to recognize that human behavior in these matters is predictable
and, because of that predictability, it is possible to formulate another
principle that is so universal that it too, may be considered a natural law.
Drawing from the vast experience of this early period, it can be stated as
follows:
LESSON: Whenever government sets out to manipulate the money supply,
regardless of the intelligence or good intentions of those who attempt to
direct the process, the result is inflation/ economic chaos, and political
upheaval. By contrast, whenever government is limited in its monetary power
to only the maintenance of honest weights and measures of precious metals,
the result is price stability, economic prosperity, and political
tranquility.
Therefore,
LAW: For a nation to enjoy economic prosperity and political tranquility,
the monetary power of its politicians must be limited solely to the
maintenance of honest weights and measures of precious metals.
As we shall see in the following chapters, the centuries of monetary
upheaval that followed that early period contain no evidence that this law
has been repealed by modern man.
SUMMARY
Knowledge of the nature of money is essential to an understanding of the
Federal Reserve.
Contrary to common belief, the topic is neither mysterious
nor complicated. For the purposes of this study, money is defined as
anything which is accepted as a medium of exchange.
Building on that, we
find there are four kinds of money: commodity, receipt, fiat, and
fractional. Precious metals were the first commodity money to appear in
history and ever since have been proven by actual experience to be the only
reliable base for an honest monetary system. Gold, as the basis of money,
can take several forms: bullion, coins, and fully backed paper receipts.
Man
has been plagued throughout history with the false theory that the quantity
of money is important, specifically that more money is better than less.
This has led to perpetual manipulation and expansion of the money supply
through such practices as coin clipping, debasement of the coin content,
and, in later centuries, the issuance of more paper receipts than there was
gold to back them.
In every case, these practices have led to economic and
political disaster.
In those rare instances where man has refrained from
manipulating the money supply and has allowed it to be determined by
free-market production of the gold supply, the result has been prosperity
and tranquility.
Chapter Eight
FOOL'S GOLD
The history of paper money without precious-metal backing forced on the
public by government decree; the emergence of our present-day
fractional-reserve banking system based on the issuance of a greater amount
of receipts for gold than the bank has in gold to back them up.
We previously have broken down the concept of money into four categories:
commodity, receipt, fiat, and fractional. In the last chapter we examined
commodity and receipt money in some detail. In doing so, we also established
certain monetary principles which apply regardless of their form.
We shall
now turn to the remaining two categories, both of which are represented by
paper and which are at the root of almost all of modern man's economic woes.
FIAT MONEY
The American Heritage Dictionary defines fiat money as "paper money decreed
legal tender, not backed by gold or silver."
The two characteristics of fiat
money, therefore, are,
(1) it does not represent anything of intrinsic value
(2) it is decreed legal tender
Legal tender simply means that there is
a law requiring everyone to accept the currency in commerce.
The two always
go together |because, since the money really is worthless, it soon would be
rejected by the public in favor of a more reliable medium of exchange, such
as gold or silver coin. Thus, when governments issue fiat money, they always
declare it to be legal tender under pain of fine or imprisonment. The only
way a government can [exchange its worthless paper money for tangible goods
and services is to give its citizens no choice.
The first notable use of this practice was recorded by Marco Polo during his
travels to China in the thirteenth century.
The famous explorer gives us
this account:
The Emperor's mint then is in this same City of Cambaluc, and the way it is
wrought is such that you might say he hath the Secret of Alchemy in
perfection, and you would be right!...
What they take is a certain fine white bast or skin which lies between the
wood of the tree and the thick outer bark, and this they make into something
resembling sheets of paper, but black. When these sheets have been prepared
they are cut up into pieces of different sizes. The smallest of these sizes
is worth a half tornesel.... There is also a kind worth one Bezant of gold,
and others of three Bezants, and so up to ten.
All these pieces of paper are issued with as much solemnity and authority as
if they were of pure gold or silver; and on every piece, a variety of
officials, whose duty it is, have to write their names and to put their
seals.
And when all is prepared duly, the chief officer deputed by the Kaan
smears the Seal entrusted to him with vermilion and impresses it on the
paper, so that the form of the Seal remains stamped upon it in red; the
money is then authentic.
Any one forging it would be punished with death.
And the Kaan causes every year to be made such a vast quantity of this
money, which costs him nothing, that it must equal in amount all the
treasures in the world!
With these pieces of paper, made as I have described, he causes ail payments
on his own account to be made, and he makes them to pass current universally
over all his Kingdoms.... And nobody, however important he may think
himself, dares to refuse them on pain of death. And indeed everybody takes
them readily.1

Gold (Seal Beach, California: '76 Press, 1977), pp. 26-28.
One is tempted to marvel at the Kaan's audacious power and the subservience
of his subjects who endured such an outrage; but our smugness rapidly
vanishes when we consider the similarity to our own Federal Reserve Notes.
They are adorned with signatures and seals; counterfeiters are severely
punished; the government pays its expenses with them; the population is
forced to accept them; they - and the "invisible" checkbook money into which
they can be converted - are made in such vast quantity that it must equal in
amount all the treasures of the world.
And yet they cost nothing to make. In
truth, our present monetary system is an almost exact replica of that which
supported the warlords of seven centuries ago.
THE COLONIAL EXPERIENCE
Unfortunately, the present situation is not unique to our history.
In fact,
after China, the next place in the world to adopt the use of fiat money was
America; specifically, the Massachusetts Bay Colony. This event has been
described as,
"not only the origin of paper money in America, but also in the
British Empire, and almost in the Christian world." 1
1- Ernest Ludlow Bogart, Economic
History of the American People (New York: Longmans, Green and Co., 1930), p.
172.
In 1690, Massachusetts launched a military raid against the French colony in
Quebec.
She had done this before and, each time, had brought back sufficient
plunder to more than pay for the expedition. This time, however, the foray
was a dismal failure, and [the men returned empty handed. When the soldiers
demanded their pay, Massachusetts found its coffers empty.
Disgruntled
soldiers have a way of becoming unruly, so the officials scrambled for some
way to raise the funds. Additional taxes would have been extremely
unpopular, so they decided simply to print paper money.
In order to convince
the soldiers and the citizenry to accept it, the government made two solemn
promises:
(1) it would redeem the paper for gold or silver coin just as soon
as there was sufficient tax revenue to do so
(2) absolutely no
additional paper notes would ever be issued
Both pledges were promptly
broken.
Only a few months later, it was announced that the original issue
was | insufficient to discharge the government's debt, and a new issue
almost six times greater was put into circulation.
The currency wasn't
redeemed for nearly forty years, long after those who had made the pledge
had faded from the scene.
A CLASSIC PATTERN
Most of the other colonies were quick to learn the magic of the printing
press, and the history that followed is a classic example of pause and
effect:
Governments artificially expanded the money [supply through the
issuance of fiat currency. This was followed by legal tender laws to force
its acceptance.
Next came the disappearance of gold or silver coins which
went, instead, into private hoards pr to foreign traders who insisted on the
real thing for their wares. Many of the colonies repudiated their previous
money by issuing pew bills valued at multiples of the old.
Then came political
discontent and civil disobedience. And at the end of each cycle there was
rampant inflation and economic chaos.
In 1703, South Carolina declared that its money was "a good payment and
tender in law" and then added that, should anyone refuse to honor it as
such, they would be fined an amount equal to "double the value of the bills
so refused."
By 1716, the penalty had been increased to "treble the value."1
THE PRINTING PRESS AND INFLATION
Benjamin Franklin was an ardent proponent of fiat money during those years
and used his great influence to sell the idea to the public.
We can get some
idea of the ferment of the times by noting that, in 1736, writing in his
Pennsylvania Gazette, Franklin apologized for its irregular publication, and
explained that the printer was,
"with the Press, labouring for the
public
Good, to make Money more plentiful." 2
The printing of money was apparently a
major, time-consuming operation.
In 1737, Massachusetts devalued its fiat currency by 66%, offering one
dollar of new currency for three of the old. The promise was made that,
after five years, the new money would be fully redeemed in silver or gold.
The promise was not kept.3
By the late 1750s, Connecticut had price inflated by 800%. The Carolinas had
inflated 900%. Massachusetts 1000%. Rhode Island 2300%.4
Naturally, these
inflations all had to come to an end and, when they did, they turned into
equally massive deflations and depressions.
It has been shown that, even in
colonial times, the classic booms and busts which modern economists are fond
of blaming on an "unbridled free market" actually were direct manifestations
of the expansion and contraction of fiat money which no longer was governed
by the laws of supply and demand.5

By this time, coins had completely disappeared from the scene. Some were in
private hoards, but most of them had been exported to other countries,
leaving the colonies with little choice but to use fiat money or barter.
Merchants from abroad were interested in neither of those, however, and
international trade ground almost to a halt
A BLESSING IN DISGUISE
The experiment with fiat money was a calamity to the colonists,
bit it was
also a thorn in the side of the Bank of England.
The bank liad used its
influence with the Crown to forbid the colonies to mint their own coins or
to establish local banks. This meant that, if the colonists wanted the
convenience of paper money, they would be forced to use the notes issued by
the Bank of England. No one had ^anticipated that the colonial governments
would be so inventive as to create their own paper money.
So, in 1751, Great
Britain began to pressure the colonies to redeem all of their currency and
withdraw nt from circulation. This they eventually did, and at bargain
prices, fey then, their fiat money was heavily discounted in the market Mace
and the governments were able to buy back their own currency for pennies on
the dollar.
The decree from the British Parliament, although heavily resented by the
colonists, turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The paper notes of the
Bank of England never did become a primary medium of exchange. Probably
because of their recent bad experience with paper money, the colonists
merely brought what few gold and silver coins they had out of hiding and
returned to a true commodity-money system.
At first, the doomsdayers
predicted this would spell further ruin for the colonial economy.
''There
isn't enough money" was the all-too-familiar cry.
But there was, indeed,
quite enough for, as we have already seen, any amount is sufficient
TOBACCO BECOMES MONEY
There was, in fact, a period in which other commodities became
accepted as a
secondary medium of exchange.
Such items as nails, "umber, rice, and whisky
filled the monetary void, but tobacco was the most common. Here was a
commodity which was in great demand both within the colonies and for
overseas commerce.
It pad intrinsic value; it could not be counterfeited; it
could be divided into almost any denominational quantity; and its supply
could not be increased except by the exertion of labor. In other words, it
was regulated by the law of supply and demand, which gave it great stability
in value.
In many ways, it was an ideal money. It was officially adopted as
such by Virginia in 1642 and a few years later by Maryland, but it was used
unofficially in all the other colonies, as well. So close was the identity
of tobacco with money that the previous fiat currency of New Jersey, not a
tobacco growing state, displayed a picture of a tobacco leaf on its face.
It
also carried the inscription:
"To counterfeit is Death."
Tobacco was used in
early America as a secondary medium of exchange for about two-hundred years,
until the new Constitution declared that money was, henceforth, the sole
prerogative of the federal government.
The primary currency at that juncture, however, was still gold and silver
coin, or specie, as it is called. And the immediate result of returning to a
sound monetary unit was a rapid recovery from the economic stagnation
previously inflicted by the booms and busts of fiat money. Trade and
production rose dramatically, and this, in turn, attracted an inflow of gold
and silver coin from around the world, filling the void that had been
created by years of worthless paper.
The law of supply and demand was
visibly at work.
For a while, Massachusetts had returned to specie while
Rhode Island remained on fiat money. The result was that Newport, which had
been the trade center for the West Indies, lost its trade to Boston and
became an empty port. After the colonies had returned to coin, prices
quickly found their natural equilibrium and then stayed at that point, even
during the Seven Years War and the disruption of trade that occurred
immediately prior to the Revolution.3
There is no better example of the fact
that economic systems in distress can and do recover rapidly if government
does not interfere with the natural healing process.
WAR BRINGS A RETURN OF FIAT MONEY
The War for Independence brought all of this to a sudden halt.
Wars are
seldom funded out of the existing treasury, nor are they even done so out of
increased taxes. If governments were to levy taxes on their citizens fully
adequate to finance the conflict, the [amount would be so great that many of
even its most ardent supporters would lose enthusiasm. By artificially
increasing the money supply, however, the real cost is hidden from view.
It
is still Laid, of course, but through inflation, a process that few people
understand.
The American Revolution was no exception. In order to pay the bill for
independence, both the Confederation and the individual states went heavily
into the printing business. At the beginning of the war in 1775, the total
money supply stood at $12 million. In June of that year, the Continental
Congress issued another $2 million. Before the notes were even put into
circulation, another $1 million was authorized.
By the end of the year,
another $3 million.
And still more: the Continental Army
issued its own "certificates" for the purchase of supplies
totaling $200
million.
A total of $425 million in five years on top of a base of $12
million is an increase of over 3500%. And, in addition to this massive
expansion of the money supply on the part mi the central government, it must
be remembered that the states were doing exactly the same thing.
It is
estimated that, in just five years from 1775 to the end of 1779, the total
money supply expanded by 5000%.
By contrast, the amount raised in taxes over
the five-year period was inconsequential, amounting to only a few million
dollars.
AND A MASSIVE INFLATION
The first exhilarating effect of this flood of new money was the flush of
apparent prosperity, but that was quickly followed by inflation as the
self-destruct mechanism began to operate.
In 1775, paper Continentals were
traded for one dollar in gold. In 1777, they were exchanged for twenty-five
cents.
By 1779, just four years from their issue, they were worth less than
a penny. The phrase "Not Worth a Continental" has its origin in this dismal
period. Shoes sold for $5,000 a pair. A suit of clothes cost a million.
It was in that year that George Washington wrote,
"A wagon load of money
will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions." 1
1. Quoted by Albert S. Bolles, The Financial History of the United States
(New York: D. Appleton, 1896,4th ed.), Vol. I, p. 132.
Even Benjamin Franklin began to see the light.
In a mood of sarcasm, he
wrote:
This Currency, as we manage it, is a wonderful machine. It performs its
Office when we issue it; it pays and clothes Troops and provides Victuals
and Ammunition; and when we are obliged to issue a Quantity excessive, it
pays itself off by Depreciation.1
1. Letter to Samuel Cooper, April 22,
1779, quoted by Albert Henry Smyth, ed., The Writings of Benjamin Franklin,
(New York: Macmillan, 1906), Vol. VII, p. 294.
When speaking of deficit spending, it is common to hear the complaint that
we are saddling future generations with the bill for what we enjoy today.
Why not let those in the future help pay for what will benefit them also?
Don't be deceived. That is a misconception encouraged by politicians to calm
the public. When money is fiat, as the colonists discovered, every
government building, public work, and cannon of war is paid out of current
labor and current wealth.
These things must be built today with today's
labor, and the man who performs that labor must also be paid today. It is
true that interest payments fall partly to future generations, but the
initial cost is paid by those in the present.
It is paid by loss of value in
the monetary unit and loss of purchasing power for one's wages.
INFLATION IS A HIDDEN TAX
Fiat money is the means by which governments obtain instant purchasing power
without taxation.
But where does that purchasing power come from? Since fiat
money has nothing of tangible value to offset it, government's fiat
purchasing power can be obtained only by subtracting it from somewhere else.
It is, in fact, "collected" from us all through a decline in our purchasing
power. It is, therefore, exactly the same as a tax, but one that is hidden
from view, silent in operation, and little understood by the taxpayer.
In 1786, Thomas Jefferson provided a clear explanation of this process when
he wrote:
Every one, through whose hands a bill passed, lost on that bill what it lost
in value during the time it was in his hands.
This was a real tax on him;
and in this way the people of the United States actually contributed
those... millions of dollars during the war, and by a mode of taxation the
most oppressive of all because the most unequal of all.2

the Article Etats-Unis Prepared for the Encyclopedia, June 22, 1786, from

ENTER PRICE CONTROLS AND LEGAL TENDER LAWS
As prices skyrocketed, the colonies enacted wage and price controls, which
was like plugging up the whistle on a tea kettle in hopes of keeping the
steam from escaping.
When that failed, there followed a series of harsh
legal tender laws. One law even invoked the specter of treason.
It said:
"If
any person shall hereafter be so lost to all virtue and regard for his
Country as to refuse to receive said bills in payment...he shall be deemed,
published, and treated as an enemy in this Country and precluded from all
trade or intercourse with the inhabitants of these colonies." 1
Rhode Island not only levied a heavy fine for non-acceptance of its notes
but, upon a second offense, an individual was stripped of citizenship. When
a court declared the act unconstitutional, the legislature called the judges
before it and summarily dismissed the offenders from office.
ENTER ECONOMIC CHAOS AND INSURRECTION
If the ravages of war were a harsh burden for the colonies to bear, the
havoc of fiat money was equally so.
After the war, inflation was followed by
deflation as reality returned to the market place. Prices fell drastically,
which was wonderful for those who were buying. But, for the merchants who
were selling or the farmers who had borrowed heavily to acquire property at
inflated wartime prices, it was a disaster. The new, lower prices were not
adequate to sustain their fixed, inflated mortgages, and many hard-working
families were ruined by foreclosure.
Furthermore, most people still did not
understand the inflation process, and there were many who continued to
advocate the "paper money cure." Several of the states were receptive to the
pressure, and their printing presses continued to roll.
Historian Andrew McLaughlin recalls a typical scene in Rhode Island at that
time as witnessed by a visiting Frenchman:
A French traveler who passed through Newport about this time gives a dismal
picture of the place: idle men standing with folded arms at the corners of
the streets; houses falling to ruins; miserable shops offering for sale
nothing but a few coarse stuffs;... grass growing in the streets; windows
stuffed with rags; everywhere announcing misery,
the triumph of paper money and the influence of bad government. The merchants
had closed their stores rather than take payment in paper; farmers from
neighboring states did not care to bring their produce.1
Idleness and
economic depression also led to outbursts of rebellion and insurrection.
In
1786, George Washington wrote to James Warren:
"The wheels of government are
clogged and ... we are descending into the vale of confusion and darkness."
2
Two years later, in a letter to Henry Knox, he said:
"If... any person had
told me that there would have been such formidable rebellion as exists, I
would have thought him a bedlamite, a fit subject for a madhouse." 3

3. Ibid., p. 4
Fortunately, there is a happy ending to that part of the story.
As we shall
see in a subsequent chapter, when the state delegates assembled to draft the
Constitution, the effects of fiat money were so fresh in their minds they
decided to put an end to it once and for all. Then, the new republic not
only rapidly recovered but went on to become the economic envy of the world
- for a while, at least - until the lesson had been forgotten by following
generations. But that is getting ahead of our story.
For now, we are dealing
with the topic of fiat money; and the experience of the American colonies is
a classic example of what always happens when men succumb to its siren call.
NATURAL LAW NO. 3
Let us pause at this point and observe another of those lessons derived from
centuries of experience. That lesson is so clear and so universal and so
widely seen throughout history that it may be stated as a natural law of
human behavior:
LESSON: Fiat money is paper money without precious-metal backing and which
people are required by law to accept.
It allows politicians to increase
spending without raising taxes. Fiat money is the cause of inflation, and
the amount which people lose in purchasing power is exactly the amount which
was taken from them and transferred to their government by this process.
Inflation, therefore, is a hidden tax.
This tax is the most unfair of all because it falls most heavily on those
who are least able to pay: the small wage earner and those on fixed
incomes. It also punishes the thrifty by eroding the value of their savings.
This creates resentment among the people, leading always to political unrest
and national disunity.
Therefore,
LAW: A nation that resorts to the use of fiat money has L doomed itself to
economic hardship and political disunity.
FRACTIONAL MONEY
Let us turn, now, to the fourth and final possible form of money: a most
intriguing concept called fractional money.
And, to understand how this
functions, we must return to Europe and the practice of the early goldsmiths
who stored the precious metal coins of their customers for a fee.
In addition to the goldsmiths who stored coins, there was another class of
merchants, called "scriveners," who loaned coins. The goldsmiths reasoned
that they, too, could act as scriveners, but do so with other people's
money. They said it was a pity for all that coin to just sit idle in their
vaults.
Why not lend it out and earn a profit which then could be split
between themselves and their depositors?
Put it to work, instead of merely
gathering dust. They had learned from experience that very few of their
depositors ever wanted to remove their coins at the same time. In fact, net
withdrawals seldom exceeded ten or fifteen per cent of their stockpile. It
seemed perfectly safe to lend up to eighty or even eighty-five per cent of
their coins.
And so the warehousemen began to act as loan brokers on behalf
of their depositors, and the concept of banking, as we know it today, was
born.
That's the way many history books describe it, but there is more involved
here than merely putting idle money to work. First of all, sharing the
interest income with the owners of the deposits was not [part of the
original concept. That only became general practice many years later after
the depositors became outraged and needed |to be reassured that these loans
were in their interest as well.
In the beginning, they didn't even know that
their coins were being loaned out.
They naively thought that the goldsmiths
were lending their own money.
DEPOSITS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR LENDING
In the second place, we need to consider whether the coin in the vault was
even available for lending - regardless of whether or not the depositors
received a part of the profit.
Let us suppose that we are playing a game of
poker at the home of Charlie Smith. Each of us has given $20 to Charlie who,
acting as the banker, has put our money into a shoe box and given us, in
return, twenty poker chips. It is the understanding that, anytime we want to
go home, we can get back a dollar for each chip we have at that time. Now
let us suppose that Charlie's brother-in-law, Larry, shows up, not to play
poker, but to borrow some money.
Since six of us are playing and each has
put in $20, there is a total of $120 in the shoe box, and that turns out to
be perfect for Larry's needs. You can imagine what would happen if Charlie
decided to lend out the "idle" money. It is not available for lending.
Neither Charlie nor any of the players have the right to loan those dollars,
because they are being held in escrow, so to speak, pending completion of
the contract between Charlie and his guests. Those dollars no longer even
exist as money.
They have been replaced - in concept at least - by the poker
chips. If any of us are so touched by Larry's story that we decide to loan
him the money ourselves, we would have to do it with other dollars or cash
in our chips for the dollars in the shoe box. In that case, of course, we
could no longer stay in the game. We cannot spend, loan, or give away the
deposit and also consider the chips to be worth anything.
If you are a member of an organization and have given your proxy to a friend
to vote in your absence at the annual meeting, you cannot then show up and
cast your own vote in addition to your proxy. Likewise, in the beginning of
banking, the certificates which were circulated as money were, in effect,
proxies for the coins.
Consequently, those coins were not available for
lending. Their monetary value had been assigned to the certificates. If the
certificate holders had wanted to lend out their coins, they should have
retired the certificates first. They were not entitled to hold spendable
paper money and also authorize their banker to lend that same money as
coins. One cannot spend, loan, or give away the coins and also consider the
certificates to be worth anything.
All of this is just common sense. But there is another dimension to the
problem which has to do with honesty in business contracts.
When the bankers used those coins as the basis for loans, they were butting
themselves in a position of not having enough coin in the [vault to make
good on their contracts when it came time for depositors to take their money
home. In other words, the new contracts were made with the full knowledge
that, under certain circumstances, they would have to be broken.
But the
bankers never bothered to explain that. The general public was led to
believe that, if they approved of putting these supposedly idle funds to
work, they would be helping the economy and earning a little profit besides.
It was an appealing proposal, and the idea caught on like wildfire.
FRACTIONAL-RESERVE BANKING
Most borrowers wanted paper money, of course, not bulky coins, so, when they
received their loans, they usually put the coins right back into the vault
for safekeeping.
They were then given receipts for these deposits which, as
we have observed, were readily accepted in commerce as money.
At this point,
things began to get I complicated. The original depositors had been given
receipts for all of the bank's coins. But the bank now issued loans in the
amount of eighty-five per cent of its deposits, and the borrowers were given
receipts for that same amount. These were in addition to the original
receipts. That made 85% more receipts than coins.
Thus, the banks created
85% more money and placed it into circulation through their borrowers. In
other words, by issuing phony receipts, they artificially expanded the money
supply. At this point, the certificates were no longer 100% backed by gold.
They now had a backing of only 54% but they were accepted by the
unsuspecting public as equal in value to the old receipts.
The gold behind
all of them, however, now represented only a fraction of their face value.
Thus, the receipts became what may be called fractional money, and the
process by which they were created is called fractional-reserve \banking.
None of this shortfall unfortunately, was ever explained. The bankers
decided that it would be better not to discuss reality where the public
could hear. These facts became the arcane secrets of the profession. The
depositors were never encouraged to question how the banks could lend out
their money and still have it on hand to
pay back on an instant's notice. Instead, bankers put on great airs of
respectability, stability, and accountability; dressed and acted serious if
not stern; erected great edifices resembling government buildings and
temples, all to bolster the false image of being able to honor their
contracts to pay on demand.
It was John Maynard Keynes who observed:
A "sound" banker, alas! is not one who foresees danger, and avoids it, but
one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way
along with his fellows, so that no one can readily blame him. It is
necessarily part of the business of a banker to maintain appearances, and to
confess a conventional respectability, which is more than human.
Life-long
practices of this kind make them the most romantic and the least realistic
of men.1
1. As quoted by Lever and Huhne, Debt
and Danger: The World Financial Crisis (New York: The Atlantic Monthly,
1986), p. 42.
CREATING MONEY OUT OF DEBT
Let us step back for a moment and analyze.
In the beginning, banks served as
warehouses for the safe keeping of their customers' coins.
When they issued
paper receipts for those coins, they converted commodity money into receipt
money. This was a great convenience, but it did not alter the money supply.
People had a choice of using either coin or paper but they could not use
both. If they used coin, the receipt was never issued. If they used the
receipt, the coin remained in the vault and did not circulate.
When the banks abandoned this practice and began to issue receipts to
borrowers, they became magicians. Some have said they created money out of
nothing, but that is not quite true. What they did was even more amazing.
They created money out of debt.
Obviously, it is easier for people to go into debt than to mine gold.
Consequently, money no longer was limited by the natural forces of supply
and demand. From that point in history forward, it was to be limited only by
the degree to which bankers have been able to push down the gold-reserve
fraction of their deposits.
From this perspective, we can now look back on fractional money and
recognize that it really is a transitional form between receipt money and
fiat money. It has some of the characteristics of both. As the fraction
becomes smaller, the less it resembles receipt money and the more closely it
comes to fiat money.
When the fraction finally reaches zero, then it has
made the complete transition and becomes pure fiat. Furthermore, there is no
example in history where men, once they had accepted the concept of
fractional money, didn't reduce the fraction lower and lower until,
eventually, it became zero.
No bank can stay in business for very long with a zero reserve. The only way
to make people accept such a worthless currency is by government force.
That's what legal-tender laws are all about. The transition from
fractional-reserve money to fiat money, therefore, requires the
participation of government through a mechanism which is called a central
bank.
Most of the balance of this book will be devoted to a study of that
Creature, but, for now, suffice it to say that the euphoria of being able to
create money without human effort is so great that, once such a narcotic is
taken, there is no politician or banker who can kick the habit.
As William
Sumner observed:
"A man might as well jump off a precipice intending to stop
half way down." 1

1884), p. 214.
NATURAL LAW NO. 4
And so, once again, we come to one of those natural laws that emerge from
centuries of human experience.
It can be stated as follows:
LESSON: Fractional money is paper money which is backed by precious metals
up to only a portion of the face amount. It is a hybrid, being part receipt
money and part fiat money.
Generally, the public is unaware of this fact and
believes that fractional money can be redeemed in full at any time. When the
truth is discovered, as periodically happens, there are runs on the bank,
and only the first few depositors in line can be paid. Since fractional
money earns just as much interest for the bankers as does gold or silver,
the temptation is great for them to create as much of it as possible.
As
this happens, the fraction which represents the reserve becomes smaller and
smaller until, eventually, it is reduced to zero.
Therefore,
LAW: Fractional money will always degenerate into fiat money. It is but fiat
money in transition.
So much for the overview and generalities. In the next chapter We shall see
what history has to say on this process. And what a history it is!
SUMMARY
Fiat money is paper money without precious-metal backing which people are
required by law to accept.
The first recorded appearance of fiat money was
in thirteenth century China, but its use on a major scale did not occur
until colonial America. The experience was disastrous, leading to massive
inflation, unemployment, loss of property, and political unrest. During one
period when the Bank of England forced the colonies to abandon their fiat
money, general prosperity quickly returned.
The Revolutionary War brought
fiat money back to the colonies with a vengeance. The economic chaos that
resulted led the colonial governments to impose price controls and harsh
legal tender laws, neither of which were effective.
Fractional money is defined as paper money with precious-metal backing for
part, not all, of its stated value. It was introduced in Europe when
goldsmiths began to issue receipts for gold which they did not have, thus
only a fraction of their receipts was redeemable.
Fractional money always
degenerates into pure fiat money.
Chapter Nine
THE SECRET SCIENCE
The condensed history of fractional-reserve banking; the unbroken record of
fraud, booms, busts, and economic chaos; the formation of the Bank of
England, the world's first central bank, which became the model for the
Federal Reserve System.
Banks of deposit first appeared in early Greece, concurrent with the
development of coinage itself.
They were known in India at the time of
Alexander the Great. They also operated in Egypt as part of the public
granary system. They appeared in Damascus in 1200 and in Barcelona in 1401.
It was the city-state of Venice, however, which is considered the cradle of
banking as we know it today.
THE BANK OF VENICE
By the year 1361, there already had been sufficient abuse in banking that
the Venetian Senate passed a law forbidding bankers to engage in any other
commercial pursuit, thus removing the [temptation to use their depositors'
funds to finance their own [enterprises.
They were also required to open
their books for public Inspection and to keep their stockpile of coins
available for viewing pt all reasonable times. In 1524, a board of bank
examiners was treated and, two years later, all bankers were required to
settle accounts between themselves in coin rather than by check.
In spite of these precautions, however, the largest bank at that Time, the
house of Pisano and Tiepolo, had been active in lending against its reserves
and, in 1584, was forced to close its doors because of inability to refund
depositors. The government picked up the pieces at that point and a state
bank was established, the Banco della Piazza del Rialto.
Having learned from
the recent experience with bankruptcy, the new bank was not allowed to make
any loans. There could be no profit from the issuance of credit. The bank
was required to sustain itself solely from fees for loin storage, exchanging
currencies, handling the transfer of payments between customers, and notary
services.
The formula for honest banking had been found. The bank prospered and soon
became the center of Venetian commerce. Its paper receipts were widely
accepted far beyond the country's borders and, in fact, instead of being
discounted in exchange for gold coin as was the usual practice, they
actually carried a premium over coins.
This was because there were so many
kinds of coin in circulation and such a wide variance of quality within the
same type of coin that one had to be an expert to evaluate their worth. The
bank performed this service automatically when it took the coins into its
vault. Each was evaluated, and the receipt given for it was an accurate
reflection of its intrinsic worth.
The public, therefore, was far more
certain of the value of the paper receipts than of many of the coins and,
consequently, was willing to exchange a little bit more for them.
Unfortunately, with the passage of time and the fading from memory of
previous banking abuses, the Venetian Senate eventually succumbed to the
temptation of credit. Strapped for funds and not willing to face the voters
with a tax increase, the politicians decided they would authorize a new bank
without restrictions against loans, have the bank create the money they
needed, and then "borrow" it.
So, in 1619, the Banco del Giro was formed,
which, like its bankrupt predecessor, began immediately to create money out
of nothing for the purpose of lending it to the government. Eighteen years
later, the Banco della Piazza del Rialto was absorbed into the new bank, and
history's first tiny flame of sound banking sputtered and died.
Throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, banks had been springing
up all over Europe. Almost without exception, however, they followed the
lucrative practice of lending money which was not truly available for loan.
They created excess obligations against their reserves and, as a result,
every one of them failed.
That is not to say that their owners and directors
did not prosper.
It merely means that their depositors lost all or a part of
their assets entrusted for safekeeping.
THE BANK OF AMSTERDAM
It wasn't until the Bank of Amsterdam was founded in 1609 that we find a
second example of sound banking practices, and the results were virtually
the same as previously experienced by the Banco della Piazza del Rialto.
The
bank only accepted deposits and steadfastly refused to make loans. Its
income was derived solely from service fees. All payments in and around
Amsterdam soon came to be made in paper currency issued by the bank and, in
fact, that currency carried a premium over coin itself. The burgomasters
and the city council were required to take an annual oath swearing that the
coin reserve of the bank was intact.
Galbraith reminds us:
For a century after its founding it functioned usefully and with notably
strict rectitude. Deposits were deposits, and initially the metal remained
in storage for the man who owned it until he transferred it to another. None
was loaned out. In 1672, when the armies of Louis XIV approached Amsterdam,
there was grave alarm.
Merchants besieged the bank, some in the suspicion
that their wealth might not be there. All who sought their money were paid,
and when they found this to be so, they did not want payment.
As was often
to be observed in the future, however desperately people want their money
from a bank, when they are assured they can get it, they no longer want it.1
1- Galbraith, p. 16.
The principles of honesty and restraint were not to be long lived, however.
The temptation of easy profit from money creation was simply too great. As
early as 1657, individuals had been permitted to overdraw their accounts
which means, of course, that the bank created new money out of their debt.
In later years [enormous loans were made to the Dutch East Indies Company.
The truth finally became known to the public in January of 1790, and
demands for a return of deposits were steady from that date forward.
Ten
months later, the bank was declared insolvent and was taken over by the City
of Amsterdam.
THE BANK OF HAMBURG
The third and last experience with honest banking occurred in Germany with
the Bank of Hamburg.
For over two centuries it faithfully adhered to the
principle of safe deposit. So scrupulous was its administration that, when
Napoleon took possession of the bank in 1813, he found 7,506,956 marks in
silver held against liabilities of 7,489,343. That was 17,613 more than was
actually needed.
Most of the bank's treasure that Napoleon hauled away
was
restored a few years later by the French government in the [form of
securities. It is not clear if the securities were of much value Put, even
if they were, they were not the same as silver.
Because of foreign invasion,
the bank's currency was no longer fully convertible into coin as receipt money. It was now fractional money, and the
self-destruct mechanism had been set in motion. The bank lasted another
fifty-five years until 1871 when it was ordered to liquidate all of its
accounts.
That is the end of the short story of honest banking. From that point
forward, fractional-reserve banking became the universal practice.
But there
were to be many interesting twists and turns in its development before it
would be ready for something as sophisticated as the Federal Reserve System.
EARLY BANKING IN ENGLAND
In England, the first paper money was the exchequer order of Charles II.
It
was pure fiat and, although it was decreed legal tender, it was not widely
used. It was replaced in 1696 by the exchequer bill. The bill was redeemable
in gold, and the government went to great lengths to make sure that there
was enough actual coin or bullion to make good on the pledge. In other
words, it was true receipt money, and it became widely accepted as the
medium of exchange.
Furthermore, the bills were considered as short-term
loans to the government and actually paid interest to the holders.
In 1707, the recently created Bank of England was given the responsibility of
managing this currency, but the bank found more profit in the circulation of
its own banknotes, which were in the form of fractional money and which
provided for the collection of interest, not the payment of it.
Consequently, the government bills gradually passed out of use and were
replaced by banknotes which, by the middle of the eighteenth century, became
England's only paper money.
It must be understood that, at this time, the Bank of England was not yet
fully developed as a central bank.
It had been given a monopoly over the
issue of banknotes within London and other prime geographic areas, but they
were not yet decreed as legal tender. No one was forced to use them. They
were merely private fractional receipts for gold coin issued by a private
bank which the public could accept, reject, or discount at its pleasure.
Legal tender status was not conferred upon the bank's money until 1833.
Meanwhile, Parliament had granted charters to numerous other banks
throughout the empire and, without exception, the issuance of fractional
money led to their ultimate demise and the ruin of their depositors.
"Disaster after disaster had to come upon the country," says Shaw, because
"of the indifference of the state to these mere private paper tokens."1
The
Bank of England, however, was favored by the government above all others
and, time after time, it was saved from insolvency by Parliament. How it
came to be that way is an interesting story.
THE BANK OF ENGLAND
England was financially exhausted after half a century of war against France
and numerous civil wars fought largely over excessive taxation.
By the time
of the War of the League of Augsberg in 1693, King William was in serious
need for new revenue.
Twenty years previously, King Charles II had flat out
repudiated a debt of over a million pounds which had been lent to him by
scores of goldsmiths, with the result that ten-thousand depositors lost
their savings. This was still fresh in everyone's memory, and, needless to
say, the government was no longer considered a good investment risk.
Unable
to increase taxes and unable to borrow, Parliament became desperate for some
other way to obtain the money.
The objective, says Groseclose, was not to
bring,
"the money mechanism under more intelligent control, but to provide
means outside the onerous sources of taxes and public loans for the
financial requirements of an impecunious government." 2
There were two groups of men who saw a unique opportunity arise out of this
necessity.
The first group consisted of the -political scientists within the
government. The second was comprised of the monetary scientists from the
emerging business of banking.
The organizer and spokesman of this group was
William Paterson from Scotland.
Paterson had been to America and came back
with a grandiose scheme to obtain a British charter for a commercial company
to colonize the Isthmus of Panama, then known as Darien. The government was
not interested in that, so Paterson turned his attention to a scheme that
did interest it very much, the creation of money.
The two groups came together and formed an alliance. No, that is too soft a
word. The American Heritage Dictionary defines a cabal
as "A conspiratorial group of plotters or intriguers."
There is no other
word that could so accurately describe this group.
With much of the same
secrecy and mystery that surrounded the meeting on Jekyll Island, the Cabal
met in Mercer's Chapel in London and hammered out a seven-point plan which
would serve their mutual purposes:
-
The government would grant a charter to the monetary scientists
to form a bank
-
The bank would be given a monopoly to issue banknotes which
would circulate as England's paper currency
-
The bank would create money out of nothing with only a fraction
of its total currency backed by coin
-
The monetary scientists then would loan the government all the
money it needed
-
The money created for government loans would be backed
primarily by government I.O.U.s
-
Although this money was to be created out of nothing and would
cost nothing to create, the government would pay "interest" on it at the
rate of 8%
-
Government LO.U.s would also be
considered as "reserves" for creating additional loan money for
private commerce. These loans also would earn interest. Thus, the
monetary scientists would collect double interest on the same
nothing 1
The circular which was distributed to attract subscribers to the Bank's
initial stock offering explained:
"The Bank hath benefit of interest on all
the moneys which it, the Bank, creates out of nothing." 2
1. For an overview of these agreements,
see Murray Rothbard, The Mystery of Banking (New York: Richardson & Snyder,
1983), p. 180. Also Martin Mayer, The Bankers (New York: Weybright & Talley,
1974), pp. 24-25.
2. Quoted by Caro Quigley, Tragedy and Hope. A History of the World in Our
Time (New York: Macmillan, 1966), p. 49. Paterson did not benefit from his
own creation. He withdrew from the Bank over a policy disagreement within a
few months after its formation and then returned to Scotland where he
succeeded in selling his Darien scheme. Frugal Scots thronged to buy stock
and to book passage to the fever-ridden land. The stock became worthless and
almost all the 1200 colonists lost their lives.
The charter was
issued in 1694, and a strange creature took its initial breath of life. It
was the world's first central bank.
Rothbard writes:
In short, since there were not enough private savers willing to finance the
deficit, Paterson and his group were graciously willing to buy government
bonds, provided they could do so with newly-created out-of-thin-air bank
notes carrying a raft of special privileges with them. This was a splendid
deal for Paterson and company, and the government benefited from the
flimflam of a seemingly legitimate bank's financing their debts...
As soon
as the Bank of England was chartered in 1694, King William himself and
various members of Parliament rushed to become shareholders of the new money
factory they had just created.1
THE SECRET SCIENCE OF MONEY
Both groups within the Cabal were handsomely rewarded for their efforts.
The
political scientists had been seeking about £500,000 to finance the current
war. The Bank promptly gave them more than twice what they originally
sought. The monetary scientists started with a pledged capital investment of
£1,200,000.
Textbooks tell us that this was lent to the government at 8%
interest, but what is usually omitted is the fact that, at the time the loan
was made, only £720,000 had been invested, which means the Bank "loaned"
66% more than it had on hand.2
1. Rothbard, Mystery, p. 180.
2. See R.D. Richards, Ph.D., The Early History of Banking in England (New
York-Augustus M. Kelley, original edition 1929, reprinted 1965), pp. 148-50.
Furthermore, the Bank was given the
privilege of creating at least an equal amount of money in the form of loans
to the public. So, after lending their capital to the government, they still
had it available to loan out a second time.
An honest loan of their £720,000 at 8% would have yielded £57,600 interest.
But, with the new secret science, they were able to earn 8% on £1,200,000
given to the government plus an estimated 9% on £720,000 loaned to the
public. That adds up to £160,800, more than 22% on their investment. The
real point, however, is that, under these circumstances, it is meaningless
to talk about a rate of interest. When money is created out of nothing, the
true interest rate is not 8% or 9% or even 22%. It is infinity.
In this first official act of the world's first central bank can be seen the
grand pretense that has characterized all those which have followed. The
Bank pretended to make a loan but what it really did was to manufacture the
money for government's use. If the government had done this directly, the
fiat nature of the currency would
been immediately recognized, and it probably would not have been accepted at
full face value in payment for the expenses of war.
By creating money
through the banking system, however, the process became mystifying to the
general public. The newly created bills and notes were indistinguishable
from those previously backed by coin, and the public was none the wiser.
The reality of central banks, therefore - and we must not forget that the
Federal Reserve System is such a creature - is that, under the guise of
purchasing government bonds, they act as hidden money machines which can be
activated any time the politicians want.
This is a godsend to the political
scientists who no longer must depend on taxes or the good credit of their
treasury to raise money. It is even easier than printing and, because the
process is not understood by the public, it is politically safe.
The monetary scientists, of course, are amply paid for this service. To
preserve the pretense of banking, it is said they collect interest, but this
is a misnomer. They didn't lend money, they created it.
Their compensation,
therefore, should be called what it is: a professional fee, or commission,
or royalty, or kickback, depending on your perspective, but not interest.
FROM INFLATION TO BANK RUNS
The new money created by the Bank of England splashed through the economy
like rain in April.
The country banks outside of the London area were
authorized to create money on their own, but they had to hold a certain
percentage of either coin or Bank of England certificates in reserve.
Consequently, when these plentiful banknotes landed in their hands, they
quickly put them into the vaults and then issued their own certificates in
even greater amounts.
As a result of this pyramiding effect, prices rose
100% in just two years.
Then, the inevitable happened:
There was a run on
the bank, and the Bank of England could not produce the coin.
When banks cannot honor their contracts to deliver coin in return for their
receipts, they are, in fact, bankrupt.
They should be allowed to go out of
business and liquidate their assets to satisfy their creditors just like any
other business. This, in fact, is what always had happened to banks which
loaned out their deposits and created fractional money. Had this practice
been allowed to continue, there is little doubt that people eventually would
have understood that they simply do not want to do business with those kinds
of banks.
Through the painful but highly effective process of trial and
error, mankind would have learned to distinguish real money from fool's
gold. And the world would be a lot better because of it today.
That, of course, was not allowed to happen. The Cabal is a partnership, and
each of the two groups is committed to protect each other, not out of
loyalty, but out of mutual self interest. They know that, if one falls, so
does the other. It is not surprising, therefore, that, when there was a run
on the Bank of England, Parliament intervened.
In May of 1696, just two
years after the Bank was formed, a law was passed authorizing it to "suspend
payment in specie."
By force of law, the Bank was now exempted from having
to honor its contract to return the gold.
THE PATTERN OF PROTECTION WAS SET
This was a fateful event in the history of money, because the precedent has
been followed ever since.
In Europe and America, the banks have always
operated with the assumption that their partners in government will come to
their aid when they get into trouble. Politicians may speak about
"protecting the public," but the underlining reality is that the government
needs the fiat money produced by the banks. The banks, therefore - at least
the big ones - must not be allowed to fail.
Only a cartel with government
protection can enjoy such insulation from the workings of a free market.
It is commonly observed in modern times that criminals often are treated
lightly when they rob their neighbor. But if they steal from the government
or a bank, the penalties are harsh. This is merely another manifestation of
the Cabal's partnership. In the eyes of government, banks are special, and
it has been that way even from the beginning of their brotherhood.
For
example, Galbraith tells us:
In 1780, when Lord George Gordon led his mob through London in protest
against the Catholic Relief Acts, the Bank was a principal target. It
signified the Establishment. For so long as the Catholic districts of London
were being pillaged, the authorities were slow to react.
When the siege of
the Bank began, things were thought more serious. Troops intervened, and
ever since soldiers have been sent to guard the Bank by night.1
1. Galbraith, p. 34.
BOOMS AND BUSTS NOW GUARANTEED
Once the Bank of England had been legally protected from the consequences of
converting debt into money, the British economy was doomed to a nauseating
roller-coaster ride of inflation, booms, and busts.
The natural and
immediate result was the granting of massive loans for just about any wild
scheme imaginable. Why not? The money cost nothing to make, and the
potential profits could be enormous.
So the Bank of England, and the country
banks which pyramided their own money supply on top of the Bank's supply,
pumped a steady stream of new money into the economy. Great stock companies
were formed and financed by this money. One was for the purpose of draining
the Red Sea to recover the gold supposedly lost by the Egyptians when
pursuing the Israelites.
£150,000,000 were siphoned into vague and fruitless
ventures in South America and Mexico.
The result of this flood of new money - how many times must history repeat
it? - was even more inflation. In 1810, the House of Commons created a
special committee, called the Select Committee on the High Price of Gold
Bullion, to explore the problem and to find a solution.
The verdict handed
down in the final report was a model of clarity. Prices were not going up,
it said. The value of the currency was going down, and that was due to the
fact that it was being created at a faster rate than the creation of goods
to be purchased with it.
The solution? The committee recommended that the
notes of the Bank of England be made fully convertible into gold coin, thus
putting a brake on the supply of money that could be created.
IN DEFENSE OF THE GOLD STANDARD
One of the most outspoken proponents of a true gold standard was a Jewish
London stockbroker by the name of David Ricardo.
Ricardo argued that an
ideal currency,
"should be absolutely invariable in value."1
He conceded that
precious metals were not perfect in this regard because they do shift in
purchasing power to a small degree.
Then he said:
"They are, however, the
best with which we are acquainted." 2
1. David Ricardo, The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo: Pamphlets
2515 - 1823, Piero Sraffa, ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
1951), Vol. IV, p. 58.
2. Ibid., p. 62.
Almost everyone in government agreed with Ricardo's assessment, but, as is
often the case, theoretical truth was fighting a losing [battle against
practical necessity. Men's opinions on the best form of money were one
thing. The war with Napoleon was another, and rjt demanded a constant inflow
of funding.
England continued to |use the central-bank mechanism to extract
that revenue from the populace.
DEPRESSION AND REFORM
By 1815, prices had doubled again and then fell sharply.
The Corn Act was
passed that year to protect local growers from lower-priced imports.
Then,
when corn and wheat prices began to climb once more in spite of the fact
that wages and other prices were falling, there was widespread discontent
and rebellion.
"By 1816," notes Roy Jastram, "England was in deep
depression. There was stagnation of industry and trade generally; the iron
and coal industries were paralyzed... Riots occurred spasmodically from May
through December."1
1- Roy W. Jastram, The Golden Constant
(New York: Wiley, 1977), p. 113.
In 1821, after the war had ended and there was no longer a need lo fund
military campaigns, the political pressure for a gold standard became too
strong to resist, and the Bank of England returned to a convertibility of
its notes into gold coin.
The basic central-bank mechanism was not
dismantled, however. It was merely limited by a new formula regarding the
allowable fraction of reserves.
The Bank continued to create money out of
nothing for the purpose of lending and, within a year, the flower of a new
[business boom unfolded. Then, in November of 1825, the flower matured into
its predestined fruit. The crisis began with the collapse of Sir Peter Cole
and Company and was soon followed by the failure of sixty-three other banks.
Fortunes were wiped out and the economy plunged back into depression.
When a similar crisis with still more bank failures struck again. In 1839,
Parliament attempted to come to grips with the problem. After five more
years of analysis and debate, Sir Robert Peel succeeded in passing a banking
reform act. It squarely faced the cause of England's booms and busts: an
elastic money supply.
V/hat feel's Bank Act of 1844 attempted to do was to
limit the amount of money the banks could create to roughly the same as it
would be if their banknotes were backed by gold or silver.
It was a good
try, but it ultimately failed because it fell short on three counts:
-
It
was a political compromise and was not strict enough, allowing the banks to
still create lending money out of nothing to the extent of £14,000,000; in
other words, a "fractional" amount thought to be safe at the time
-
The
limitation applied only to paper currency issued by the Bank. It did not
apply to checkbook money, and that was then becoming the preferred form of
exchange. Consequently, the so-called reform did not even apply to the area
where the greatest amount of abuse was taking place
-
The basic
concept was allowed to remain unchallenged that man, in his infinite
political wisdom, can determine what the money supply should be more
effectively than an unmanaged system of gold or silver responding to the law
of supply and demand.
THE ROLLER COASTER CONTINUES
Within three years of the "reform," England faced another crisis with still
more bank failures and more losses to depositors.
But when the Bank of
England tottered on the edge of insolvency, once again the government
intervened. In 1847, the Bank was exempted from the legal reserve
requirements of the Peel Act. Such is the rock-steady dependability of
man-made limits to the money supply.
Groseclose continues the story:
Ten years later, in 1857, another crisis occurred, due to excessive arid
unwise lending as a result of over-optimism regarding foreign trade
prospects.
The bank found itself in the same position as in 1847, and
similar measures were taken. On this occasion the bank was forced to use the
authority to increase its fiduciary [debt-based money] issue beyond the
limit imposed by the Bank Charter Act...
Again in 1866, the growth of banking without sufficient attention to
liquidity, and the use of bank credit to support a speculative
craze...prepared the way for a crash which was finally precipitated by the
failure of the famous house of Overend, Gurney and Co. The Act of 1844 was
once more suspended....
In 1890, the Bank of England once again faced crisis, again the result of
widespread and excessive speculation in foreign securities, particularly
American and Argentine. This time it was the failure of Baring Brothers that
precipitated the crash.1

THE MECHANISM SPREADS TO OTHER COUNTRIES
It is an incredible fact of history that, in spite of the general and
recurring failures of the Bank of England during these years, the
central-bank mechanism was so attractive to the political and monetary
scientists that it became the model for all of Europe.
The Rank of Prussia
became the Reichsbank. Napoleon established the Banque de France. A few
decades later, the concept became the venerated model for the Federal
Reserve System. Who cares if the scheme is destructive? Here is the perfect
tool for obtaining unlimited funding for politicians and endless profits for
bankers.
And, best of all, the little people who pay the bills for both
groups have practically no idea what is being done to them.
SUMMARY
The business of banking began in Europe in the fourteenth century. Its
function was to evaluate, exchange, and safeguard people's coins.
In the
beginning, there were notable examples of totally honest banks which
operated with remarkable efficiency considering the vast variety of coinage
they handled. They also issued paper receipts which were so dependable they
freely circulated as money and cheated no one in the process. But there was
a great demand for more money and more loans, and the temptation soon caused
the bankers to seek easier paths.
They began lending out pieces of paper
that said they were receipts, but which in fact were counterfeit. The public
could not tell one from the other and accepted both of them as money. From
that point forward, the receipts in circulation exceeded the gold held in
reserve, and the age of fractional-reserve banking had dawned.
This led
immediately to what would become an almost unbroken record from then to the
present: a record of inflation, booms and busts, suspension of payments,
bank failures, repudiation of currencies, and recurring spasms of economic
chaos.
The Bank of England was formed in 1694 to institutionalize
fractional-reserve banking. As the world's first central bank, it introduced
the concept of a partnership between bankers and politicians. The
politicians would receive spendable money (created out of nothing by the
bankers) without having to raise taxes. In return, the bankers would receive
a commission on the transaction - deceptively called interest - which would
continue in perpetuity.
Since it all seemed to be wrapped up in the
mysterious rituals
of banking, which the common man was not expected to understand, there was
practically no opposition to the scheme.
The arrangement proved so
profitable to the participants that it soon spread to many other countries
in Europe and, eventually, to the United States.
Chapter Ten
THE MANDRAKE MECHANISM
The method by which the Federal Reserve creates money out of nothing; the
concept of usury as the payment of interest on pretended loans; the true
cause of the hidden tax called inflation; the way in which the Fed creates
boom-bust cycles.
In the 1940s, there was a comic strip character called Mandrake the
Magician.
His specialty was creating things out of nothing and, when
appropriate, to make them disappear back into that same void. It is fitting,
therefore, that the process to be described in this section should be named
in his honor.
In the previous chapters, we examined the technique developed by the
political and monetary scientists to create money out of nothing for the
purpose of lending. This is not an entirely accurate description because it
implies that money is created first and then waits for someone to borrow it.
On the other hand, textbooks on banking often state that money is created
out of debt.
This also is misleading because it implies that debt exists
first and then is converted into money. In truth, money is not created until
the instant it is borrowed. It is the act of borrowing which causes it to
spring into existence. And, incidentally, it is the act of paying off the
debt that causes it to vanish.1
There is no short phrase that perfectly
describes that process. So, until one is invented along the way, we shall
continue using the phrase "create money out of nothing" and
occasionally add
"for the purpose of lending" where necessary to further clarify the
meaning.
1 - Printed Federal Reserve Notes that sit in the Treasury's vault do not
become money until they are released into circulation in exchange for
checkbook money that was created by a bank loan. As long as the bills are in
the vault with no debt-based money to replace them, they technically are
just paper, not money.
So, let us now leave the historical figures of the past and jump into their
"future," in other words, into our present, and see just how far this
money/debt-creation process has been carried - and how it works.
The first fact that needs to be considered is that our money today has no
gold or silver behind it whatsoever.
The fraction is not 54% nor 15%. It is
0%. It has travelled the path of all previous fractional money in history
and already has degenerated into pure fiat money. The fact that most of it
is in the form of checkbook balances rather than paper currency is a mere
technicality; and the fact that bankers speak about "reserve ratios" is eye
wash.
The so-called reserves to which they refer are, in fact, Treasury
bonds and other certificates of debt. Our money is pure fiat through and
through.
The second fact that needs to be clearly understood is that, in spite of the
technical jargon and seemingly complicated procedures, the actual mechanism
by which the Federal Reserve creates money is quite simple.
They do it
exactly the same way the goldsmiths of old did except, of course, the
goldsmiths were limited by the need to hold some precious metal in reserve,
whereas the Fed has no such restriction.
THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS CANDID
The Federal Reserve itself is amazingly frank about this process.
A booklet
published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York tells us:
"Currency cannot
be redeemed, or exchanged, for Treasury gold or any other asset used as
backing. The question of just what assets 'back' Federal Reserve notes has
little but bookkeeping significance." 1
Elsewhere in the same publication we are told:
"Banks are creating money
based on a borrower's promise to pay (the IOU)... Banks create money by
'monetizing' the private debts of businesses and individuals." 2
1. I Bet You Thought, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, p. 11.
2. Ibid., p. 19.
In a booklet entitled Modern Money Mechanics, the Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago says:
In the United States neither paper currency nor deposits have value as
commodities.
Intrinsically, a dollar bill is just a piece of paper. Deposits
are merely book entries. Coins do have some intrinsic value as metal, but
generally far less than their face amount.
What, then, makes these instruments - checks, paper money, and coins -
acceptable at face value in payment of all debts and for other monetary
uses? Mainly, it is the confidence people have that they will be able to
exchange such money for other financial assets and real goods and services
whenever they choose to do so.
This partly is a matter of law; currency has
been designated "legal tender" by the government - that is, it must be
accepted.1
In the fine print of a footnote in a bulletin of the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis, we find this surprisingly candid explanation:
Modern monetary systems have a fiat base - literally money by decree - with
depository institutions, acting as fiduciaries, creating obligations against
themselves with the fiat base acting in part as reserves.
The decree appears
on the currency notes:
"This note is legal tender for all debts, public and
private."
While no individual could refuse to accept such money for debt
repayment, exchange contracts could easily be composed to thwart its use in
everyday commerce. However, a forceful explanation as to why money is
accepted is that the federal government requires it as payment for tax
liabilities.
Anticipation of the need to clear this debt creates a demand
for the pure fiat dollar.2

Reserve Bank of Chicago, revised October 1982, p. 3.

Reserve Bank of St. Louis, p. 25.
MONEY WOULD VANISH WITHOUT DEBT
It is difficult for Americans to come to grips with the fact that their
total money supply is backed by nothing but debt, and it is even more mind
boggling to visualize that, if everyone paid back all that was borrowed,
there would be no money left in existence.
That's right, there would be not
one penny in circulation - all coins and all paper currency would be
returned to bank vaults - and there would be not one dollar in any one's
checking account. In short, all money would disappear.
Marriner Eccles was the Governor of the Federal Reserve System in 1941. On
September 30 of that year, Eccles was asked to give testimony before the
House Committee on Banking and Currency.
The purpose of the hearing was to
obtain information regarding the role of the Federal Reserve in creating
conditions that led to the depression of the 1930s. Congressman Wright Patman, who was Chairman of that committee, asked how the Fed got the money
to purchase two billion dollars worth of government bonds in 1933.
This is
the exchange that followed.
ECCLES: We created it.
PATMAN: Out of what?
ECCLES: Out of the right to issue credit money.
PATMAN: And there is nothing behind it, is there, except our
government's credit? ECCLES: That is what our money system is. If there were
no
debts in our money system, there wouldn't be any money.
It must be realized that, while money may represent an asset to selected
individuals, when it is considered as an aggregate of the total money
supply, it is not an asset at all.
A man who borrows $1,000 may think that
he has increased his financial position by that amount but he has not. His
$1,000 cash asset is offset by his $1,000 loan liability, and his net
position is zero. Bank accounts are exactly the same on a larger scale. Add
up all the bank accounts in the nation, and it would be easy to assume that
all that money represents a gigantic pool of assets which support the
economy.
Yet, every bit of this money is owed by someone. Some will owe
nothing. Others will owe many times what they possess. All added together,
the national balance is zero. What we think is money is but a grand
illusion.
The reality is debt.
Robert Hemphill was the Credit Manager of the Federal Reserve Bank in
Atlanta. In the foreword to a book by Irving Fisher, entitled 100% Money,
Hemphill said this:
If all the bank loans were paid, no one could have a bank deposit, and there
would not be a dollar of coin or currency in circulation. This is a
staggering thought. We are completely dependent on the commercial banks.
Someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation, cash, or credit.
If the banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous; if not, we
starve. We are absolutely without a permanent money system. When one gets a
complete grasp of the picture, the tragic absurdity of our hopeless
situation is almost incredible - but there it is.1
1. Irving Fisher, 100% Money (New York: Adelphi, 1936), p. xxii.
With the knowledge that money in America is based on debt, it should not
come as a surprise to learn that the Federal Reserve System is not the least
interested in seeing a reduction in debt in this country, regardless of
public utterances to the contrary.
Here is the bottom line from the System's
own publications.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia says:
"A large
and growing number of analysts, on the other hand, now regard the national
debt as something useful, if not an actual blessing.... [They believe] the
national debt need not be reduced at all."1
The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago adds:
"Debt - public and private - is
here to stay. It plays an essential role in economic processes... What is
required is not the abolition of debt, but its prudent use and intelligent
management."2
1- The National Debt, Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia, pp. 2, 11
2- Two Faces of Debt, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, p. 33.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH A LITTLE DEBT?
There is a kind of fascinating appeal to this theory.
It gives those who
expound it an aura of intellectualism, the appearance of being able to grasp
a complex economic principle that is beyond the comprehension of mere
mortals. And, for the less academically minded, it offers the comfort of at
least sounding moderate.
After all, what's wrong with a little debt,
prudently used and intelligently managed? The answer is nothing, provided
the debt is based on an honest transaction. There is plenty wrong with it if
it is based upon fraud.
An honest transaction is one in which a borrower pays an agreed upon sum in
return for the temporary use of a lender's asset. That asset could be
anything of tangible value. If it were an automobile, for example, then the
borrower would pay "rent." If it is money, then the rent is called
"interest."
Either way, the concept is the same.
When we go to a lender - either a bank or a private party - and receive a
loan of money, we are willing to pay interest on the loan in recognition of
the fact that the money we are borrowing is an asset which we want to use.
It seems only fair to pay a rental fee for that asset to the person who owns
it. It is not easy to acquire an automobile, and it is not easy to acquire
money - real money, that is.
If the money we are borrowing was earned by
someone's labor and talent, they are fully entitled to receive interest on
it. But what are we to think of money that is created by the mere stroke of
a pen or the click of a computer key? Why should anyone collect a rental fee
on that?
When banks place credits into your checking account, they are merely
pretending to lend you money.
In reality, they have nothing to lend. Even
the money that non-indebted depositors have placed with them was originally
created out of nothing in response to someone else's loan.
So what entitles
the banks to collect rent on nothing?
It is immaterial that men everywhere
are forced by law to accept these nothing certificates in exchange for real
goods and services. We are talking here, not about what is legal, but what
is moral.
As Thomas Jefferson observed at the time of his protracted battle
against central banking in the United States,
"No one has a natural right to
the trade of money lender, but he who has money to lend."1
THIRD REASON TO ABOLISH THE SYSTEM
Centuries ago, usury was defined as any interest charged for a loan. Modern
usage has redefined it as excessive interest.
Certainly, any amount of
interest charged for a pretended loan is excessive. The dictionary,
therefore, needs a new definition.
Usury: The charging of any interest on a
loan of fiat money.
Let us, therefore, look at debt and interest in this light
Thomas Edison
summed up the immorality of the system when he said:
People who will not turn a shovel full of dirt on the project nor contribute
a pound of materials will collect more money... than will the people who will
supply all the materials and do all the work.2
1. The Writings of Thomas Jefferson,
Library Edition (Washington: Jefferson Memorial Association, 1903), Vol
XIII, p. 277-78.
2. As quoted by Brian L. Bex, The Hidden Hand (Spencer, Indiana: Owen Litho,
1975), p. 161. Unfortunately, Edison did not understand the whole problem.
He was correctly opposed to paying interest to banks for their fiat money,
but he was not opposed to government fiat money. It was only the interest to
which he objected. He did not see the larger picture of how fiat money, even
when issued solely by the government and without interest has always been
destructive of the economy through the creation of inflation, booms, and
busts.
Is that an exaggeration?
Let us consider the purchase of a $100,000 home in
which $30,000 represents the cost of the land, architect's fee, sales
commissions, building permits, and that sort of thing and $70,000 is the
cost of labor and building materials. If the home buyer puts up $30,000 as a
down payment, then $70,000 must be borrowed.
If the loan is issued at 11%
over a 30-year period, the amount of interest paid will be $167,806.
That
means the amount paid to those who loan the money is about 2½ times
greater than paid to those who provide all the labor and all the materials.
It is true that this figure represents the time-value of that money over
thirty years and easily could be justified on the basis that a lender
deserves to be compensated for surrendering the use of his capital for half
a lifetime.
But that assumes the lender actually had something to surrender,
that he had earned the capital, saved it, and then loaned it for
construction of someone else's house. What are we to think, however, about a
lender who did nothing to earn the money, had not saved it, and, in fact,
simply created it out of thin air? What is the time-value of nothing?
As we have already shown, every dollar that exists today, either in the form
of currency, checkbook money, or even credit card money - in other words,
our entire money supply - exists only because it was borrowed by someone;
perhaps not you, but someone.
That means all the American dollars in the
entire world are earning I daily and compounded interest for the banks which
created them. A portion of every business venture, every investment, every
profit, 'every transaction which involves money - and that even includes
losses and the payment of taxes - a portion of all that is earmarked as
payment to a bank.
And what did the banks do to earn this perpetually
flowing river of wealth? Did they lend out their own capital obtained
through the investment of stockholders? Did they lend out the hard-earned
savings of their depositors? No, neither of these were their major source
of income.
They simply waved the magic wand called fiat money.
The flow of such unearned wealth under the guise of interest can only be
viewed as usury of the highest magnitude. Even if there were no other
reasons to abolish the Fed, the fact that it is the supreme Instrument of
usury would be more than sufficient by itself.
WHO CREATES THE MONEY TO PAY THE INTEREST?
One of the most perplexing questions
associated with this process is,
"Where
does the money come from to pay the interest?"
If you borrow $10,000 from a
bank at 9%, you owe $10,900.
But the bank only manufactures $10,000 for the
loan. It would seem, therefore, that there is no way that you - and all
others with similar loans - can possibly pay off your indebtedness. The
amount of money put into circulation just isn't enough to cover the total
debt, including Interest This has led some to the conclusion that it is
necessary for you to borrow the $900 for the interest, and that, in turn,
leads to still
more interest.
The assumption is that, the more we borrow, the more we have
to borrow, and that debt based on fiat money is a never-ending spiral
leading inexorably to more and more debt.
This is a partial truth. It is true that there is not enough money created
to include the interest, but it is a fallacy that the only way to pay it
back is to borrow still more. The assumption fails to take into account the
exchange value of labor. Let us assume that you pay back your $10,000 loan
at the rate of approximately $900 per month and that about $80 of that
represents interest. You realize you are hard pressed to make your payments
so you decide to take on a part-time job.
The bank, on the other hand, is
now making $80 profit each month on your loan.
Since this amount is
classified as "interest" it is not extinguished as is the larger portion
which is a return of the loan itself. So this remains as spendable money in
the account of the bank. The decision then is made to have the bank's floors
waxed once a week. You respond to the ad in the paper and are hired at $80
per month to do the job.
The result is that you earn the money to pay the
interest on your loan, and - this is the point - the money you receive is
the same money which you previously had paid. As long as you perform labor
for the bank each month, the same dollars go into the bank as interest, then
out the revolving door as your wages, and then back into the bank as loan
repayment.
It is not necessary that you work directly for the bank. No matter where you
earn the money, its origin was a bank and its ultimate destination is a
bank.
The loop through which it travels can be large or small, but the fact
remains all interest is paid eventually by human effort. And the
significance of that fact is even more startling than the assumption that
not enough money is created to pay back the interest. It is that the total
of this human effort ultimately is for the benefit of those who create fiat
money.
It is a form of modern serfdom in which the great mass of society
works as indentured servants to a ruling class of financial nobility.
UNDERSTANDING THE ILLUSION
That's really all one needs to know about the operation of the banking
cartel under the protection of the Federal Reserve.
But it would be a shame to stop here without
taking a look at the actual cogs, mirrors, and pulleys that make the magical
mechanism work. It is a truly fascinating engine of mystery and deception.
Let us, therefore, turn our attention to the
actual process by which the magicians create the illusion of modern money. First
we shall stand back for a general view to see the overall action.
Then we
shall move in closer and examine each component in detail.
THE MANDRAKE MECHANISM: AN OVERVIEW
DEBT
The entire function of this machine is to convert debt into money. It's just
that simple. First, the Fed takes all the government bonds which the public
does not buy and writes a check to Congress in exchange for them. (It
acquires other debt obligations as well, but government bonds comprise most
of its inventory.)
There is no money to back up this check. These fiat
dollars are created on the spot for that purpose. By calling those bonds
"reserves," the Fed then uses them as the base for creating 9 additional
dollars for every dollar created for the bonds themselves.
The money created
for the bonds is spent by the government, whereas the money created on top
of those bonds is the source of all the bank loans made to the nation's
businesses and individuals. The result of this process is the same as
creating money on a printing press, but the illusion is based on an
accounting trick rather than a printing trick.
The bottom line is that
Congress and the banking cartel have entered into a partnership in which the
cartel has the privilege of collecting interest on money which it creates
out of nothing, a perpetual override on every American dollar that exists in
the world. Congress, on the other hand, has access to unlimited funding
without having to tell the voters their taxes are being raised through the
process of inflation.
If you understand this paragraph, you understand the
Federal Reserve System.
MONEY
Now for a more detailed view. There are three general ways in which the
Federal Reserve creates fiat money out of debt.
One is by making loans to the member banks
through what is called the Discount Window. The second is by purchasing
Treasury bonds and other certificates of debt through what is called the Open Market Committee.
The third is by changing the so-called reserve ratio that member banks are
required to hold. Each method is merely a different path to the same
objective: taking in IOUs and converting them into spendable money.
THE DISCOUNT WINDOW
The Discount Window is merely bankers' language for the loan window.
When
banks run short of money, the Federal Reserve stands ready as the "bankers'
bank" to lend it. There are many reasons for them to need loans.
Since they
hold "reserves" of only about one or two per cent of their deposits in vault
cash and eight or nine per cent in securities, their operating margin is
extremely thin. It is common for them to experience temporary negative
balances caused by unusual customer demand for cash or unusually large
clusters of checks all clearing through other banks at the same time.
Sometimes they make bad loans and, when these former "assets" are removed
from their books, their "reserves" are also decreased and may, in fact,
become negative.
Finally, there is the profit motive. When banks borrow from
the Federal Reserve at one interest rate and lend it out at a higher rate,
there is an obvious advantage. But that is merely the beginning. When a bank
borrows a dollar from the Fed, it becomes a one-dollar reserve. Since the
banks are required to keep reserves of only about ten per cent, they
actually can loan up to nine dollars for each dollar borrowed.1
Lets take a look at the math. Assume the bank receives $1 million from the
Fed at a rate of 8%.
The total annual cost, therefore, is $80,000 (.08 X
$1,000,000). The bank treats the loan as a cash deposit, which means it
becomes the basis for manufacturing an additional $9 million to be lent to
its customers. If we assume that it lends that money at 11% interest, its
gross return would be $990,000 (.11 X $9,000,000).
Subtract from this the
bank's cost of $80,000 plus an appropriate share of its overhead, and we
have a net return of about $900,000. In other words, the bank borrows a
million and can almost double it in one year.1
That's leverage...
But don't
forget the source of that leverage: the manufacture of another $9 million
which is added to the nation's money supply.
1- The banks must cover these loans with bonds or other interest-bearing
assets which it possesses, but that does not diminish the money-multiplier
effect of the new deposit.
THE OPEN MARKET OPERATION
The most important method used by the Federal Reserve for the creation of
fiat money is the purchase and sale of securities on the open market.
But,
before jumping into this, a word of warning. Don't expect what follows to
make any sense. Just be prepared to know that this is how they do it.
The trick lies in the use of words and phrases which have technical meanings
quite different from what they imply to the average citizen. So keep your
eye on the words.
They are not meant to explain but to deceive.
In spite of
first appearances, the process is not complicated. It is just absurd.
THE MANDRAKE MECHANISM: A DETAILED VIEW
Start with...
1 - GOVERNMENT DEBT
The federal government adds ink to a piece of paper, creates impressive
designs around the edges, and calls it a bond or Treasury note. It is merely
a promise to pay a specified sum at a specified interest on a specified
date.
As we shall see in the following steps, this debt eventually becomes
the foundation for almost the entire nation's money supply.2
2- Debt obligations from the
private sector and from other governments also are used in the same way,
but government bonds are the primary instruments.
In reality, the
government has created cash, but it doesn't yet look like cash. To convert
these IOUs into paper bills and checkbook money is the function of The
Federal Reserve System.
To bring about that transformation, the bond is
given to the Fed where it is then classified as a ...
2 - SECURITIES ASSET
An instrument of government debt is considered an asset because it is
assumed the government will keep its promise to pay. This is based upon its
ability to obtain whatever money it needs through taxation. Thus, the
strength of this asset is the power to take back that which it gives.
So the
Federal Reserve now has an "asset" which can be used to offset a liability.
It then creates this liability by adding ink to yet another piece of paper
and exchanging that with the government in return for the asset.
That second
piece of paper is a ...
3 - FEDERAL RESERVE CHECK
There is no money in any account to cover this check. Anyone else doing that
would be sent to prison. It is legal for the Fed, however, because Congress
wants the money, and this is the easiest way to get it.
(To raise taxes
would be political suicide; to depend on the public to buy all the bonds
would not be realistic, especially if interest rates are set artificially
low; and to print very large quantities of currency would be obvious and
controversial.)
This way, the process is mysteriously wrapped up in the
banking system. The end result, however, is the same as turning on
government printing presses and simply manufacturing fiat money (money
created by the order of government with nothing of tangible value backing
it) to pay government expenses.
Yet, in accounting terms, the books are said
to be balanced" because the liability of the money is offset by the "asset"
of the IOU. The Federal Reserve check received by the government then is
endorsed and sent back to one of the Federal Reserve banks where it now
becomes a ...
Reserves for what? Are these for paying off depositors should they want to
close out their accounts? No. That's the lowly function they served when
they were classified as mere assets. Now that they have been given the name
of "reserves," they become the magic wand to materialize even larger amounts
of fiat money. This is where the real action is: at the level of the
commercial banks.
Here's how it works. The banks are permitted by the Fed to
hold as little as 10% of their deposits in "reserve." That means, if they
receive deposits of $1 million from the first wave of fiat money created by
the Fed, they have $900,000 more than they are required to keep on hand ($1 million less 10%
reserve).
In bankers' language, that $900,000 is called...
4
- EXCESS RESERVES
The word "excess" is a tipoff that these so-called reserves have a special
destiny. Now that they have been transmuted into an excess, they are
considered as available for lending. And so in due course these excess
reserves are converted into ...
5 - BANK LOANS
But wait a minute. How can this money be loaned out when it is owned by the
original depositors who are still free to write checks and spend it any time
they wish? Isn't that a double claim against the same money?
The answer is
that, when the new loans are made, they are not made with the same money at
all. They are made with brand new money created out of thin air for that
purpose. The nation's money supply simply increases by ninety per cent of
the bank's deposits. Furthermore, this new money is far more interesting to
the banks than the old.
The old money, which they received from depositors,
requires them to pay out interest or perform services for the privilege of
using it. But, with the new money, the banks collect interest, instead,
which is not too bad considering it cost them nothing to make. Nor is that
the end of the process.
When this second wave of fiat money moves into the
economy, it comes right back into the banking system, just as the first wave
did, in the form of...
6
- MORE COMMERCIAL BANK DEPOSITS
The process now repeats but with slightly smaller numbers each time around.
What was a "loan" on Friday comes back into the bank as a "deposit" on
Monday. The deposit then is reclassified as a "reserve" and ninety per cent
of that becomes an "excess" reserve which, once again, is available for a
new "loan." Thus, the $1 million of first wave fiat money gives birth to
$900,000 in the second wave, and that gives birth to $810,000 in the third
wave ($900,000 less 10% reserve).
It takes about twenty-eight times through
the revolving door of deposits becoming loans becoming deposits becoming
more loans until the process plays itself out to the maximum effect, which
is...
7
- BANK FIAT MONEY = UP TO 9 TIMES GOVERNMENT
The amount of fiat money created by the banking cartel is approximately nine
times the amount of the original government debt which made the entire
process possible.1
1- That is a theoretical maximum. In actual practice, the banks can seldom
loan out all of the money they are allowed to create, and the numbers fall
short of the -maximum.
When the original debt itself is added to that figure, we
finally have ...
8
- TOTAL FIAT MONEY = UP TO 10 TIMES GOVERNMENT
The total amount of fiat money created by the Federal Reserve and the
commercial banks together is approximately ten times the amount of the
underlying government debt.
To the degree that this newly created money
floods into the economy in excess of goods and services, it causes the
purchasing power of all money, both old and new, to decline. Prices go up
because the relative value of the money has gone down. The result is the
same as if that purchasing power had been taken from us in taxes.
The
reality of this process, therefore, is that it is a...
9 - HIDDEN TAX = UP TO 10 TIMES THE NATIONAL DEBT
Without realizing it, Americans have paid over the years, in addition to
their federal income taxes and excise taxes, a completely hidden tax equal
to many times the national debt! And that still is not the end of the
process.
Since our money supply is purely an arbitrary entity with nothing
behind it except debt, its quantity can go down as well as up. When people are going deeper into debt, the nation's
money supply expands and prices go up, but when they pay off their debts and
refuse to renew, the money supply contracts and prices tumble. That is
exactly what happens in times of economic or political uncertainty.
This
alternation between periods of expansion and contraction of the money supply
is the underlying cause of...
10 - BOOMS, BUSTS, AND DEPRESSIONS
Who benefits from all of this? Certainly not the average citizen.
The only
beneficiaries are the political scientists in Congress who enjoy the effect
of unlimited revenue to perpetuate their power, and the monetary scientists
within the banking cartel called the Federal Reserve System who have been
able to harness the American people, without their knowing it, to the yoke
of modern feudalism.
RESERVE RATIOS
The previous figures are based on a "reserve" ratio of 10% (a
money-expansion ratio of 10-to-l).
It must be remembered, however, that this
is purely arbitrary. Since the money is fiat with no precious-metal backing,
there is no real limitation except what the politicians and money managers
decide is expedient for the moment.
Altering this ratio is the third way in
which the Federal Reserve can influence the nation's supply of money. The
numbers, therefore, must be considered as transient. At any time there is a
"need" for more money, the ratio can be increased to 20-to-1 or 50-to-1, or
the pretense of a reserve can be dropped altogether.
There is virtually no
limit to the amount of fiat money that can be manufactured under the present
system.
NATIONAL DEBT NOT NECESSARY FOR INFLATION
Because the Federal Reserve can be counted on to "monetize" (convert into
money) virtually any amount of government debt, and because this process of
expanding the money supply is the primary cause of inflation, it is tempting
to jump to the conclusion that federal debt and inflation are but two
aspects of the same phenomenon.
This, however, is not necessarily true. It
is quite possible to have either one without the other.
The banking cartel holds a monopoly in the manufacture of money.
Consequently, money is created only when IOUs are "monetized" by the Fed or
by commercial banks. When private individuals, corporations, or institutions
purchase government bonds, they must use money they have previously earned
and saved. In other words, no new money is created, because they are using
funds that are already in existence.
Therefore, the sale of government bonds
to the banking system is inflationary, but when sold to the private sector,
it is not.
That is the primary reason the United States avoided massive
inflation during the 1980s when the federal government was going into debt
at a greater rate than ever before in its history. By keeping interest rates
high, these bonds became attractive to private investors, including those in
other countries.1 Very little new money was created, because most of the
bonds were purchased with American dollars already in existence.
This, of
course, was a temporary fix at best.
Today, those bonds are continually
maturing and are being replaced by still more bonds to include >the original
debt plus accumulated interest. Eventually this process i must come to an
end and, when it does, the Fed will have no choice but to literally buy back
all the debt of the '80s - that is, to replace all I of the formerly
invested private money with newly manufactured fiat money - plus a great
deal more to cover the interest.
Then we will understand the meaning of
inflation.
On the other side of the coin, the Federal Reserve has the option of
manufacturing money even if the federal government does not go deeper into
debt. For example, the huge expansion of the money supply leading up to the
stock market crash in 1929 occurred at a time when the national debt was
being paid off. In every year from 1920 through 1930, federal revenue
exceeded expenses, and there were relatively few government bonds being
offered.
The massive -inflation of the money supply was
made possible by converting commercial bank loans into "reserves" at the
Fed's discount window and by the Fed's purchase of banker's acceptances, which are
commercial contracts for the purchase of goods.
Now the options are even greater. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 has made
it possible for the Creature to monetize virtually any
debt instrument, including IOUs from foreign governments. The apparent
purpose of this legislation is to make it possible to bail out those
governments which are having trouble paying the interest on their loans from
American banks.
When the Fed creates fiat American dollars to give foreign
governments in exchange for their worthless bonds, the money path is
slightly longer and more twisted, but the effect is similar to the purchase
of U.S. Treasury Bonds.
The newly created dollars go to the foreign
governments, then to the American banks where they become cash reserves.
Finally, they flow back into the U.S. money pool (multiplied by nine) in the
form of additional loans. The cost of the operation once again is born by
the American citizen through the loss of purchasing power.
Expansion of the
money supply, therefore, and the inflation that follows, no longer even
require federal deficits.
As long as someone is willing to borrow American
dollars, the cartel will have the option of creating those dollars
specifically to purchase their bonds and, by so doing, continue to expand
the money supply.
We must not forget, however, that one of the reasons the Fed was created in
the first place was to make it possible for Congress to spend without the
public knowing it was being taxed. Americans have shown an amazing
indifference to this fleecing, explained undoubtedly by their lack of
understanding of how the Mandrake Mechanism works.
Consequently, at the
present time, this cozy contract between the banking cartel and the
politicians is in little danger of being altered. As a practical matter,
therefore, even though the Fed may also create fiat money in exchange for
commercial debt and for bonds of foreign governments, its major concern
likely will be to continue supplying Congress.
The implications of this fact are mind boggling. Since our money supply, at
present at least, is tied to the national debt, to pay off that debt would
cause money to disappear. Even to seriously reduce it would cripple the
economy.1
Therefore, as long as the Federal Reserve exists, America will be,
must be, in debt.
The purchase of bonds from other governments is accelerating in the present
political climate of internationalism. Our own money supply increasingly is
based upon their debt as well as ours, and they, too, will not be allowed to
pay it off even if they are able.
TAXES NOT EVEN NECESSARY
It is a sobering thought that the federal government now could operate -
even at its current level of spending - without levying any taxes
whatsoever.
All it has to do is create the required money through the
Federal Reserve System by monetizing its own bonds. In fact, most of the
money it now spends is obtained that way.
If the idea of eliminating the IRS sounds like good news, remember that the
inflation that results from monetizing the debt is just as touch a tax as
any other; but, because it is hidden and so few Americans understand how it
works, it is more politically popular than a tax that is out in the open.
Inflation can be likened to a game of Monopoly in which the game's banker
has no limit to the amount of money he can distribute. With each throw of
the dice he reaches under the table and brings up another stack of those
paper tokens which all the players must use as money. If the banker is also
one of the players - and in our real world that is exactly the case -
obviously he is going to end up owning all the property.
But, in the
meantime, the increasing flood of money swirls out from the banker and
engulfs the players. As the quantity of money becomes greater, the relative
worth of teach token becomes less, and the prices bid for the properties
goes up. The game is called monopoly for a reason. In the end, one person
holds all the property and everyone else is bankrupt.
But what does it
matter. It's only a game.
Unfortunately, it is not a game in the real world. It is our livelihood, our
food, our shelter. It does make a difference if there is only one winner,
and it makes a big difference if that winner obtained his monopoly simply by
manufacturing everyone's money.
FOURTH REASON TO ABOLISH THE SYSTEM
Make no mistake about it, inflation is a tax.
Furthermore, it is the most
unfair tax of them all because it falls most heavily upon those who are
thrifty, those on fixed incomes, and those in the middle and lower income
brackets. The important point here is that this hidden tax would be
impossible without fiat money. Fiat money in America created solely as a
result of the Federal Reserve System.
Therefore, it is totally accurate to
say that the Federal Reserve System
generates our most unfair tax. Both the tax and the System that makes it
possible should be abolished.
The political scientists who authorize this process of monetizing the
national debt, and the monetary scientists who carry it out, know that it is
not true debt. It is not true debt, because no one in Washington really
expects to repay it - ever. The dual purpose of this magic show is simply to
create free spending money for the politicians, without the inconvenience of
raising direct taxes, and also to generate a perpetual river of gold flowing
into the banking cartel.
The partnership is merely looking out for itself.
Why, then, does the federal government bother with taxes at all? Why not
just operate on monetized debt?
The answer is twofold First, if it did,
people would begin to wonder about the source of the money, and that might
cause them to wake up to the reality that inflation is a tax. Thus, open
taxes at some level serve to perpetuate public ignorance which is essential
to the success of the scheme.
The second reason is that taxes, particularly
progressive taxes, are weapons by which elitist social planners can wage war
on the middle class.
A TOOL FOR SOCIAL PLANNING
The January 1946 issue of American Affairs carried an article written by
Beardsley Ruml who, at that time, was Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York.
Ruml had devised the system of automatic withholding during
World War II, so he was well qualified to speak on the nature and purpose of
the federal income tax. His theme was spelled out in the title of his
article: "Taxes for Revenue Are Obsolete."
In an introduction to the article, the magazine's editor summarized Ruml's
views as follows:
His thesis is that, given control of a central banking system and an
inconvertible currency [a currency not backed by gold], a sovereign national
government is finally free of money worries and needs no longer levy taxes
for the purpose of providing itself with revenue.
All taxation, therefore,
should be regarded from the point of view of social and economic
consequences.1
1. "Taxes for Revenue Are Obsolete/' by
Beardsley Ruml, American Affairs, January, 1946, p. 35.
Ruml explained that, since the Federal Reserve now can create out of nothing
all the money the government could ever want, there remain only two reasons
to have taxes at all.
The first of these is to combat a rise in the general
level of prices. His argument was that, when people have money in their
pockets, they will spend it for goods and services, and this will bid up the
prices.
The solution, he says, is to take the money away from them through
taxation and let the government spend it instead. This, too, will bid up
prices, but Ruml chose not to go into that.
He explained his theory this way:
The dollars the government spends become purchasing power in the hands of
the people who have received them. The dollars the government takes by taxes
cannot be spent by the people, and therefore, these dollars can no longer be
used to acquire the things which are available for sale.
Taxation is,
therefore, an instrument of the first importance in the administration of
any fiscal and monetary policy.1
REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH
The other purpose of taxation, according to Ruml, is to redistribute the
wealth from one class of citizens to another.
This must always be done in
the name of social justice or equality, but the real objective is to
override the free market and bring society under the control of the master
planners.
Ruml said:
The second principle purpose of federal taxes is to attain more equality of
wealth and of income than would result from economic forces working alone.
The taxes which are effective for this purpose are the progressive
individual income tax, the progressive estate tax, and the gift tax.
What
these taxes should be depends on public policy with respect to the
distribution of wealth and of income. These taxes should be defended and
attacked in terms of their effect on the character of American life, not as
revenue measures.2
1- Ruml, p. 36.
2- Ibid., p. 36.
As we have seen, Senator Nelson Aldrich was one of the creators of the
Federal Reserve System.
That is not surprising in light of the cartel nature
of the System and the financial interests which he represented. Aldrich also
was one of the prime sponsors of the federal income tax. The two creations
work together as a far more delicate mechanism for control over the economic
and social life of society than either one alone.
In more recent years, there has been hopeful evidence that the master
planners were about to abandon Ruml's blueprint.
We have
heard a great deal both in Congress and at the Federal Reserve about the
necessity of reducing expenses so as to diminisn the growth of federal debt
and inflation. But it has been lip service only.
The great bulk of federal
funding continues to be created by the Mandrake Mechanism, the cost of
government continues to outpace tax revenues, and the Ruml formula reigns
supreme.
EXPANSION LEADS TO CONTRACTION
While it is true that the Mandrake Mechanism is responsible for the
expansion of the money supply, the process also works in reverse.
Just as
money is created when the Federal Reserve purchases bonds or other debt
instruments, it is extinguished by the sale of those same items. When they
are sold, the money is given back to the System and disappears into the
inkwell or computer chip from which it came. Then, the same secondary ripple
effect that created money through the commercial banking system causes it to
be withdrawn from the economy.
Furthermore, even if the Federal Reserve does
not deliberately contract the money supply, the same result can and often
does occur when the public decides to resist the availability of credit and
reduce its debt. A man can only be tempted to borrow, he cannot be forced to
do so.
There are many psychological factors involved in a decision to go into debt
that can offset the easy availability of money and a low interest rate: A
downturn in the economy, the threat of civil disorder, the fear of pending
war, an uncertain political climate, to name just a few.
Even though the Fed
may try to pump money into the economy by making it abundantly available,
the public can thwart that move simply by saying no, thank you. When this
happens, the old debts that are being paid off are not replaced by new ones
to take their place, and the entire amount of consumer and business debt
will shrink.
That means the money supply also will shrink because, in modern
America, debt is money.
And it is this very expansion and contraction of the
monetary pool - a phenomenon that could not occur if based upon the laws of
supply and demand - that is at the very core of practically every boom and
bust that has plagued mankind throughout history.
In conclusion, it can be said that modern money is a grand illusion conjured
by the magicians of finance and politics. We are living in an age of fiat
money, and it is sobering to realize that every previous nation in history
that has adopted such money eventually was economically destroyed by it.
Furthermore, there is nothing in our present monetary structure that offers
any assurance that we may be exempted from that morbid roll call.
Correction. There is one. It is still within the power of Congress to
abolish the Federal Reserve System.
SUMMARY
The American dollar has no intrinsic value. It is a classic example of fiat
money with no limit to the quantity that can be produced.
Its primary value
lies in the willingness of people to accept it and, to that end, legal
tender laws require them to do so. It is true that our money is created out
of nothing, but it is more accurate to say that it is based upon debt. In
one sense, therefore, our money is created out of less than nothing.
The
entire money supply would vanish into bank vaults and computer chips if all
debts were repaid. Under the present System, therefore, our leaders cannot
allow a serious reduction in either the national or consumer debt.
Charging
interest on pretended loans is usury, and that has become institutionalized
under the Federal Reserve System.
The Mandrake Mechanism by which the Fed
converts debt into money may seem complicated at first, but it is simple if
one remembers that the process is not intended to be logical but to confuse
and deceive. The end product of the Mechanism is artificial expansion of the
money supply, which is the root cause of the hidden tax called inflation.
This expansion then leads to contraction and, together, they produce the
destructive boom-bust cycle that has plagued mankind throughout history
wherever fiat money has existed.
