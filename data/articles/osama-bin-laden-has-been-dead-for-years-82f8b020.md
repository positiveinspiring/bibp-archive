CNN and the corporate media report this evening
that purported CIA asset Osama bin Laden has been killed by the U.S.
military in a mansion outside the Pakistani capital of Islamabad along with
other family members.
In an address to the nation,
Obama said
he ordered the strike that allegedly
killed Osama. The remainder of his speech followed the standard war on
terror propaganda script.
A small team of Americans killed bin Laden in a firefight at a compound in
Pakistan, the president said in a dramatic late-night statement at the White
House, the Associated Press reported following Obamas address.
Obama said the military took custody of his remains.
It remains to be seen
if the government will attempt to provide evidence that the remains are
indeed those of Osama bin Laden.
The fight against terror goes on, but
tonight America has sent an unmistakable message: No matter how long it
takes, justice will be done, said former president Bush. In 2006, Bush
admitted that capturing Osama was not a top priority.
In February, 2004, Iranian state radio claimed Osama bin Laden had been
captured in Pakistans border region with Afghanistan a long time ago.
Pentagon and Pakistani officials denied the
report. Osama bin Laden has been arrested a long time ago, but Bush is
intending to use it for propaganda maneuvering in the presidential
election, the radio report said.
Osama bin Laden died of kidney failure soon after the September 11, 2001,
attacks. In 2002, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said bin Laden had
kidney disease, and that he had required a dialysis machine when he lived in
Afghanistan.
That same year, the FBIs top counterterrorism official,
Dale
Watson, said,
I personally think he is probably not with us anymore.
A Taliban leader told the Pakistan Observer on December 21, 2002, that Bin
Laden was suffering from a serious lung complication and died in
mid-December, in the vicinity of the Tora Bora mountains.
The source claimed
that bin Laden was laid to rest honorably in his last abode and his grave
was made as per his Wahabi belief, according to Fox News.
Alex Jones was told live on the radio in 2002 by high-level
Council on
Foreign Relations members that Osama Bin Laden had died of kidney failure in
early 2002.
I have it from high level [sources] from
inside the Bush administration
that bin Laden died of natural causes and
that his family has given the body to the CIA, that theyre going to roll
him out right before the election, that hes on ice right now. They will
claim they killed him right before the election, Alex said at the time.
Jones gave a caution that the intelligence could be disinformation but
claimed that his base in Austin was extremely close to the Bush
administration and similar information received in the past had been
credible, Paul Joseph Watson wrote in August of 2002.
During the 2004 election, CNN reported that
Democratic insiders had been told that
George W. Bush was going to use the
Bin Laden body as an ace-in-the-hole if he thought he was in danger of
losing the 2004 election.
This confirmed the evidence that Jones had been
given by the CFR and others.
In 2003, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Fox News Channel
analyst Morton Kondracke she suspected Bush knew the whereabouts of Osama
bin Laden and was waiting for the most politically expedient moment to
announce his capture.
Benazir Bhutto, who was killed in a suicide
attack at the end of 2007, stated that Osama bin Laden had been killed by
Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a man convicted of kidnapping and killing
journalist Daniel Pearl.
Obamas announcement follows the release of a
highly suspicious birth
certificate last week.
Both events represent psychological
operations that
possibly portend more significant events in the days ahead as the U.S.
dollar continues to lose its reserve status, the economy fails to recover as
promised, and
wars expand in Libya, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.
Obamas propaganda stunt arrives as the Democrats kick off their leaders
presidential reelection bid against a number of Republicans contenders who
have been highly critical of not only his perceived handling of the economy,
but also his management of
the manufactured war on terror.
