# Elite Panicking? - Independent Media has More Power than Mainstream Media

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_internet236.htm

Let's not get confused, fake news are
fake news. And most of the websites doing their due diligence to
call out fake news are doing so by only focusing on fake stories.
The
list that surfaced calling out 'fake news' contains a number for
websites that do not post any fake news at all:
This is the problem...
Why Independent
News Is Necessary
Let's put things into perspective for a
moment.
We are here at
Standing Rock in North Dakota reporting on what's happening down
here with the
Dakota Access Pipeline. There is absolutely no
mainstream media down here. No one covering what's going on at all.
Why? Money, business, politics, it's what drives mainstream media
and its corruption.
It's not hard to understand why
independent news exists given these facts.
With the majority of the
mainstream
media being owned by just
five corporations, diverse viewpoints and interpretations of
world events have become scarce.
And when you understand that most
outlets are serving some sort of corporate or political agenda, you
start to notice how those biases play out in the representation of
certain stories, and even in how frequently they're covered.
Showing
certain stories over others, and showing them repeatedly, goes a
long way towards shaping public opinion.
A great quote here that directly related
to modern day mainstream media.
"The conscious and intelligent
manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses
is an important element in democratic society.
Those who manipulate this unseen
mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is
the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds
are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of."
Edward Bernays
("the father of public relations"), Propaganda
-
1928
Note that Bernays'
book, Propaganda, begins with the above quote
Many are unaware of how often important
stories are blacked out completely by all of mainstream media.
The major
pipeline spill that occurred during the Standing Rock protests
or the revelation that the Pentagon
paid a PR firm to create fake terrorist videos are just two
recent examples.
This leads us to wonder if there is in
fact an agenda to hide this information. And how might that work?
Sharyl Atkisson, a former CBS
investigative journalist, explained that "astroturf," or fake
grassroots movements, funded by political, corporate, or other
special interests, are very effectively
manipulating and distorting mainstream media messages.
Further, here is a document declassified
by the CIA that outlines their involvement in manipulating media,
journalists, authors, films, and more to have,
"reporters postpone, change, hold, or even scrap stories that
could have adversely affected national security interests
or jeopardized sources and methods."
The 'national security' play has always
been a way for these agencies to justify shady actions.

Given the shady dealings, agency
manipulation, and ownership structure of most of mainstream
media, the need for alternative voices is clear.
The Problems With
Independent News and Mainstream News
I have seen a lot in the past
seven years and I have seen the independent movement lose a lot of
credibility - for GOOD reason.
It's easy to dismiss alternative
news websites because so many of them so carelessly carry out their
work. There are 'good' ones out there, but they are vastly outnumbered
by the 'bad'.
This is the actual problem with fake and false news.
I decided to write this because, as
someone working within this movement and who cares a lot about
creating a better world, I want people to know the truth so they can
make informed decisions. As much as I respect many people for what
they do, there is an inherent danger in not raising awareness about
this.
If we
expose mainstream media, we should
expose alternative media too; it's only fair.
One of the main issues is that people
are not reading content these days. They are reading headlines and
making complete decisions based on those headlines.
While outlets have to stay vigilant with
writing good and clear headlines, people also need to read articles
to actually check for sources, legitimacy and what the mains points
of the piece are.
This isn't happening!
The honest truth is that everyone is
guilty of writing bad headlines sometimes, Huffpost, Buzzfeed, TYT,
MSNBC,
CNN, or any independent site. Everyone does it at some point,
because no one is perfect and sometimes it's necessary.
This is why it's important for readers
to actually read content and to really learn to use discernment
rather than just reading a title. Connecting with how the information
makes you feel at a deeper level than our belief systems is what
will help us to really discern truth.
We are being challenged to
grow, to go within and to understand ourselves at a deeper level.
Why it Has to Change
But May Not For a While
People are starting to realize en mass
that
the mainstream media
has its own agendas, and rarely, if ever,
do they align with our well-being. They are starting to move away
from this sponsored, biased content and looking for other sources.
The question becomes,
what will they find instead?
The elite controlled media is panicking
right now.
They are trying to figure out for the
first time in their existence how independent media gained more
power than they did during
this election cycle and ultimately
lost.
This isn't to say Trump isn't able to be manipulated by the cabal,
but that he clearly wasn't their choice.
Because the media and cabal is frantic
right now, they are going to do anything in their power to divert
attention away from websites that aren't actually reporting on fake
news, but that are a threat to the mainstream narrative, a threat to
the establishment.
Fake news doesn't seem to be the issue
when you look at the list of websites who made the list of "false or
fake news".
As a media organization that
spends a lot of time doing what we do, hiring the necessary people
to make sure work is done right and articles researched properly, we
have to stand up and continue to raise awareness about what is
really happening here.
This is an attack on websites that are helping to wake people up
from the mainstream narrative. So now you know. You know what to look
out for and what to do.
My advice is, stop supporting and sharing
content that isn't sourced or well researched. Think twice, three
times or even four times about what narrative mainstream media is
pushing on you.
Sharing content from certain outlets
only further confuses this entire process...
