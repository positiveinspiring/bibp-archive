Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez denounced this Saturday US plans to
attack his country and overthrow his government.
During a ceremony celebrating the 227th
birthday of Independence hero Simon Bolivar, Chavez read from a secret memo
he had been sent from an unnamed source inside the United States.
"Old friend, I haven't seen you in years. As
I said to you in my three prior letters, the idea remains the generation
of a conflict on your western border", read Chavez from the secret
missive.
"The latest events confirm all, or almost all, of what those here
discussed as well as other information that I have obtained from above",
the letter continued.
"The preparation phase in the international community, with the help of
Colombia, is in plain execution", manifested the text, referring to last
Thursday's session in the Organization of American States (OAS), during
which the Colombia government accused Venezuela of harboring
"terrorists" and "terrorist training camps" and gave the Chavez
government a "30-day ultimatum" to allow for international intervention.
The letter continued with more details,
"I told you before that the events wouldn't
begin before the 26th, but for some reason they have moved
forward several actions that were supposed to be executed afterward".
"In the United States, the execution phase is accelerating, together
with a contention force, as they call it,
towards Costa Rica with the pretext of fighting
drug trafficking".
On July 1, the Costan Rican government
authorized 46 US war ships and 7,000 marines into their maritime and
land territory.
The true objective of this military mobilization, said the letter, is to
"support military operations" against Venezuela.
Assassination and
Overthrow
"There is an agreement between Colombia and
the US with two objectives: one is Mauricio and the other is the
overthrow of the government", revealed the document.
President Chavez explained that "Mauricio" is a
pseudonym used in these communications.
"The military operation is going to happen",
warned the text, "and those from the north will do it, but not directly
in Caracas".
"They will hunt 'Mauricio' down outside Caracas, this is very important,
I repeat, this is very important".
President Chavez revealed that he had received
similar letters from the same source alerting him to dangerous threats.
He received one right before the capture of more
than 100 Colombian paramilitaries in the outskirts of Caracas that were part
of an assassination plan against the Venezuelan head of state, and another
in 2002, just days before the coup d'etat that briefly ousted him from
power.
"The letter warned of snipers and the coup",
explained Chavez, "and it was right, the information was true, but we
were unable to act to prevent it".
US Military Expansion
This information comes on the heels of the decision last Thursday to break
relations between Colombia and Venezuela, made by President Chavez after
Colombia's "show" in the OAS.
"Uribe is capable of anything", warned
Chavez, announcing that the country was on maximum alert and the borders
were being reinforced.
Last October, Colombia and the US signed a
military agreement permitting the US to occupy seven Colombian bases and to
use all Colombian territory as needed to complete missions.
One of the bases in the agreement, Palanquero,
was cited in May 2009 US Air Force documents as necessary to "conduct full
spectrum military operations" in South America and combat the threat of
"anti-US governments" in the region.
Palanquero was also signaled as critical to the Pentagon's Global
Mobility Strategy, as outlined in the February 2009 'White
Paper - Air Mobility Command Global En Route Strategy',
"USSOUTHCOM has identified Palanquero,
Colombia (German Olano Airfield SKPQ), as a cooperative security
location (CSL). From this location nearly half of the continent can be
covered by a C-17 without refueling".
The 2010 Pentagon budget included a $46 million
USD request to improve the installations at Palanquero, in order to,
"support the Command Combatant's 'Theater
Posture Strategy' and 'provide for a unique opportunity for full
spectrum operations in a critical sub region of our hemisphere where
security and stability is under constant threat from narcotics funded
terrorist insurgencies, anti-US governments, endemic poverty and
recurring natural disasters'."
The May 2009 Air Force document further
added that Palanquero would be used to,
"increase our capacity to conduct
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), improve global
reach... and expand expeditionary warfare capability".
In February 2010, the US National Directorate of
Intelligence (NDI) classified Venezuela as "Anti-US Leader" in the region in
its annual threat assessment.
The US also maintains forward operation locations (small military bases) in
Aruba and Curacao, just miles off the Venezuelan coast. In recent months,
the Venezuelan government has denounced unauthorized incursions of drone
planes and other military aircraft into Venezuelan territory, originating
from the US bases.
These latest revelations evidence that a serious, and unjustified conflict
is brewing fast against Venezuela, a country with a vibrant democracy and
the largest oil reserves in the world.
