With the completion of Barack Obamas
first Presidential visit to Israel, as expected there was a great deal of
symbolism reinforcing the bond between the two allies.
Yet still, doves on
both sides acknowledge that peace is hardly around the corner.
Understanding the true barriers to a comprehensive agreement is key to
knowing where the pressure to compromise will be coming from. Contrary to
popular belief, the core of the conflict is not borders, Israeli
settlements, or the status of Jerusalem.
An honest look at the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians
requires Obama to understand two major things before he attempts to
jump-start any peace process.
-
One is that the two state model today is
only applicable to Israel and the West Bank; there can be no
contiguous Palestine state between the West Bank and Gaza with Hamas
in power. This would represent a threat to both Israel and to
Palestine.
-
Second, the crux of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is rooted in the Palestinian "Right of
Return," the collective belief in a legal and moral right for
Palestinian refugees, and more importantly their descendents from
around the world, to return to ancestral homes in Israel that were
once part of Mandatory Palestine. The "right of return" is central
to Palestinian national identity and is a high barrier to any peace
agreement.
This is underscored in a recent telling
statement made by Hamas leader Mahmoud Al-Zahar on the Ezzedeen Al-Qassam
Brigades website.
He said that that Israels attempts to end the
UN classification of the Palestinian refugees is doomed to fail because of
how Palestinian identity is linked to the
Right of Return for eternity.
"The Palestinian refugee is a citizen
forcibly displaced from his land and his return is one of the constants
that cannot be controlled by the occupation; it is sacred like our
faith
Our grandfathers were once in their land and their grandchildren
will return to it no matter how long it takes."
This is a quasi-religious belief that crosses
all sectors of Palestinian society, and which is endlessly reproduced in
Palestinian media, education and culture, and which is endorsed by
UNRWA, the UN organ charged with
maintaining health, welfare and education services for those it has deemed
Palestinian refugees.
But Al-Zahar is also misinformed regarding the Israeli position.
Recent Israeli governments have been forthright
in stating that there is no "right of return" and increasingly they point to
it as one of the most formidable obstacles to making peace between the
Israeli and Palestinian states, as well as peoples.
But there have been no official Israeli efforts
to end or even curtail UNRWA.
Only recently has former Member of Knesset
Einat Wilf called attention to UNRWAs administrative decisions to
extend refugee status to additional generations of Palestinians, creating
more "refugees" and extending its own mandate. Wilf notes correctly that
UNRWAs endorsement of the "right of return" lies at the root of the
Arab-Israeli conflict and not co-incidentally UNRWAs continued existence.
Important legislation to reform UNRWA has also
come from U.S. Senator Mark Kirk but has not yet succeeded in passing
through the Congress.
But Al-Zahar understands the problem in the most fundamental way, that the
"right of return" - and until then, "refugee" status guaranteed and funded
by the international community - are the cornerstones of Palestinian
national identity.
From his perspective, of course, it is therefore
necessary to put the onus entirely on Israel for the "Nakba,"
the "catastrophe" of 1948 and Israels creation, as opposed to seeing any
Palestinian and Arab responsibility or agency in the matter.
If this is the core of Palestinian identity,
that can be satisfied only by exercising the Palestinian "right of return"
and the destruction of Israel, then there is no room for compromise.
To understand the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict,
the
Obama administration would be wise to listen to Al-Zahar, as
well as Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas who stated,
"I have never and will never give up the
right of return."
Abbass statement is as important as Al-Zahars
since he was forced by Palestinian and Arab outrage to clarify an earlier
comment where he had appeared to waver on the "right of return."
In the meantime, UNRWA will continue to support continuing generations of
"refugees," the majority of whom were born outside of Palestine, a large
proportion of whom are national citizens of other states.
In fact, UNRWAs former general counsel James
Lindsay has observed that,
"In truth, the vast majority of UNRWAs
registered refugees have already been 'resettled' (or, to use the UN
euphemism, 'reintegrated')" and that "only thing preventing all of these
citizens from ceasing to be 'refugees' is UNRWAs singular definition of
what constitutes a refugee."
Understanding how a UN agency is an integral
ingredient of a long-term Arab strategy to perpetuate the misery of the
Palestinians, and to keep this humanitarian burden at the center of the
Arab-Israeli conflict is another key for President Obama to keep in mind as
he visits Israel, and perhaps the West Bank.
This has been the Arab worlds biggest success
against Israel, only at the expense of the Palestinians.
If Obama truly wants to move the peace process
forward it would behoove him to look at what our taxpayer dollars are buying
in UNRWA, and at those who are truly being served.
Until he understands that the "right of return"
is the essence of the conflict, and that we need to start changing this core
Palestinian belief, President Obama should not expect any change in the near
future.
