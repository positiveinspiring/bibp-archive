I'm going to start with three data points.
The Internet is a surveillance state.
Whether we admit it to ourselves or not, and
whether we like it or not, we're being tracked all the time.
One reporter used a tool called Collusion to
track who was tracking him;
105 companies tracked his Internet use during one 36-hour period.
Increasingly, what we do on the Internet is
being combined with other data about us. Unmasking Broadwell's identity
involved correlating her Internet activity with her hotel stays. Everything
we do now involves computers, and computers produce data as a natural
by-product.
Everything is now being saved and correlated,
and many big-data companies
make money by building up intimate profiles of our lives from a variety
of sources.
Facebook, for example, correlates your
online behavior with your purchasing habits offline. And there's more.
There's location data from your cell phone, there's a record of your
movements from closed-circuit TVs.
This is
ubiquitous
surveillance: All of us
being watched, all the time, and that data being stored forever. This is
what a surveillance state looks like, and it's efficient beyond the wildest
dreams of George Orwell.
Sure, we can take measures to prevent this. We
can limit what we search on Google from our iPhones, and instead use
computer web browsers that allow us to delete cookies. We can use an alias
on Facebook. We can turn our cell phones off and spend cash. But
increasingly, none of it matters.
There are simply too many ways to be tracked.
The Internet, e-mail,
cell phones, web browsers,
social networking sites, search engines: these have become necessities,
and it's fanciful to expect people to simply refuse to use them just because
they don't like the spying, especially since the full extent of such spying
is deliberately hidden from us and there are few alternatives being marketed
by companies that don't spy.
This isn't something the free market can fix. We
consumers have no choice in the matter.
All the major companies that provide us with
Internet services are interested in tracking us. Visit a website and it will
almost certainly
know
who you are; there are lots of ways to be
tracked without
cookies. Cellphone companies
routinely undo the web's privacy protection.
One
experiment at Carnegie Mellon took real-time videos of students on
campus and was able to identify one-third of them by comparing their photos
with publicly available tagged Facebook photos.
Maintaining privacy on the Internet is nearly
impossible.
If you forget even once to enable your
protections, or click on the wrong link, or type the wrong thing, and you've
permanently attached your name to whatever anonymous service you're using.
Monsegur slipped up once, and the FBI got him. If the director of the CIA
can't maintain his privacy on the Internet, we've got no hope.
In today's world, governments and corporations
are working together to keep things that way.
Governments are happy to use the data
corporations collect - occasionally demanding that they collect more and
save it longer - to spy on us. And corporations are happy to buy data from
governments. Together the powerful spy on the powerless, and they're not
going to give up their positions of power, despite what the people want.
Fixing this requires strong government will, but
they're just as punch-drunk on data as the corporations.
Slap-on-the-wrist fines notwithstanding, no one is agitating for better
privacy laws.
So, we're done...
-
Welcome to a world where Google knows
exactly what sort of porn you all like, and more about your
interests than your spouse does.
-
Welcome to a world where your cell phone
company knows exactly where you are all the time.
-
Welcome to the end of
private conversations, because increasingly your conversations
are conducted by e-mail, text, or social networking sites.
-
And welcome to a world where all of
this, and everything else that you do or is done on a computer, is
saved, correlated, studied, passed around from company to company
without your knowledge or consent; and where the government accesses
it at will
without a warrant.
Welcome to an Internet
without
privacy, and we've ended up here with hardly a fight.
