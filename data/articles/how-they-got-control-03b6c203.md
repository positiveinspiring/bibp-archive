CONSEQUENTLY, in the interest of future
world order, peace, and tranquility, it was decided to privately wage a
quiet war against the American public with an ultimate objective of
permanently shifting the natural and social energy (wealth) of the
undisciplined and irresponsible many into the hands of the
self-disciplined, responsible, and worthy few.
[1] Energy
Section
The above paragraph, along with hundreds of
similar philosophical ideas, comes from a document (Silent
Weapons for a Quiet War) that had its 'conception' after the end
of World War II, and which was to become the playbook for what United States
of America citizens apparently are experiencing today.
This is what it was - and is - all about:
In conclusion, the objective of economic
research, as conducted by the magnates of capital (banking) and the
industries of commodities (goods) and services, is the establishment of
an economy which is totally predictable and manipulatable.
[1]
Energy Section
The last word "manipulatable" apparently is
referring to the economy being capable of being manipulated.
If nothing more, that paragraph sets the
guidelines for the economic downturn the USA has experienced and from which
it seems not to be recovering, nor will it ever recover, if the controllers
and other "worthy few" have their say and way.
Now, doesn't it all make sense? Oh, how we have
been played like a fiddle that's never had the tune up it so badly needs!
Additionally, they set out deliberately to dumb
down the population illustrated in phrases like:
The quality of education given to the lower
class must be of the poorest sort, so that the meat of ignorance
isolating the the [sic] inferior class from the superior class is and
remains incomprehensible to the inferior class.
With such an initial handicap, even bright
lower class individuals have little if any hope of extricating
themselves from their assigned lot in life. This form of slavery is
essential to maintaining some measure of social order, peace, and
tranquility for the ruling upper class.
How many U.S. citizens realize that they have
been programmed from pre-school or kindergarten to be living in slavery so
that the "ruling upper class" can have "some measure of social order, peace,
and tranquility"? Who ever heard of such elitist class action warfare?
Maybe in Germany in the late 1930s...
Under the subtitle of "Descriptive
Introduction of the Silent Weapon," we find how they planned to
implement their "Quiet War" with this:
It [the war] shoots situations, instead of
bullets; propelled by data processing, instead of chemical reaction
(explosion); originating from bits of data, instead of grains of
gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operated by a computer
programmer, instead of marksman; under the orders of a banking magnate,
instead of a military general.
Unabashedly, they acknowledge the game plan
using data processing, the computer, and
the banksters (banking magnate).
So much for all the technology everyone bought
into that has us so enthralled, we don't know which end is up, i.e., to
answer a cell phone or voice mail; send a tweet or finger a text message
using phonics instead of words. See how dumb we've become.
In talking about all the technology, they say this about their silent,
secret weapon(s):
The public cannot comprehend this weapon,
and therefore cannot believe that they are being attached [sic] and
subdued by a weapon.
That, dear readers, is the critical issue
everyone must recognize, realize, understand, and decide how to react to,
and what action you will take.
If the above doesn't gore your bull, then this ought to smack your donkey:
When a silent weapon is applied gradually to
the public, the public adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to
tolerate its encroachment on their lives until the pressure
(psychological via economic) becomes too great and they crack up.
Silent weapon - applied gradually - learn to
tolerate its encroachment - pressure becomes too great - they [we] crack up!
Now, isn't that what's going on in virtually
every segment of society in which we have been living for the last two to
three decades, especially terroristic fears?
Then we have the periodic traumatic events that galvanize us into an
untenable state of fear so that we will gladly respond to what has been
termed the Hegelian Dialectic - problem-reaction-solution - the very method
the controllers have instituted to enforce the "Quiet War" and empower
themselves to take away our human and civil rights.
Consider the flack that's going on about the U.S. Constitution and the Bill
of Rights as outdated documents.
How those very tenets of governance and
jurisprudence that have guided the USA and its society since its inception
have now been cast aside and even trampled upon by none other than those who
should know better.
Recall the events of 9-11,
especially Building 7 self-imploding with no
airplane hitting it. [2]
Recall how Watertown, Massachusetts, was turned into
a
closed 'police state' looking for a lone gunman.
Wasn't that the perfect drill that may have been
undertaken to comply with?
The solution of today's problems requires an
approach which is ruthlessly candid, with no agonizing over religious,
moral, or cultural values. [1] Security Section
How about the NSA surveillance tech and
equipment attached to buildings, utility poles, or whatever in order to
create a gulag [1a] of sorts in
Seattle, Washington and Las Vegas, Nevada.
Here is
why you should care:
What the controllers are counting on was the discovery by Mayer Amschel
Rothschild (1743-1812) of
the Rothschild banking family.
What Mr. Rothschild had discovered was the
basic principle of power, influence, and control over people as applied
to economics. That principle is "when you assume the appearance of
power, people soon give it to you". [1] Mr. Rothschild's Energy
Discovery
Are U.S. citizens unwittingly guilty of
acquiescing to the above Rothschild 'principle'? When will we wake up and
get out from under that spell of black magic?
What Rothschild's real discovery was about was that he could
induce people (inductance, with people
corresponding to a magnetic field) into surrendering their real wealth
in exchange for a promise of greater wealth (instead of real
compensation).
Rothschild, in essence, invented a
"philosopher's stone" [3] regarding monetary matters that
banksters, money lenders, and Federal Banks use to create wealth and
manipulate disparity for the rest of us.
Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency
gave him the power to rearrange the economic structure to his own
advantage...[sic] to shift economic inductance to those economic
positions which would encourage the greatest economic instability and
oscillation.
Readers, please read the above statement again.
That's what's been going on for longer than we have been led to believe, by
banksters and, particularly, by the Federal Reserve Bank System,[4]
I'm inclined to think.
As if that's not enough to get your juices running, under the "Quiet War"
section termed "The
Economic Model," we find this confirmation:
The Harvard Economic Research Project
(1948-) was an extension of World War II Operations Research. Its
purpose was to discover the science of controlling an economy; at first
the American economy, and then the world economy.
It was felt that with sufficient
mathematical foundation and data, it would be nearly as easy to predict
and control the trend of an economy as to predict and control the
trajectory of a projectile. Such as [sic] proven to be the case.
Moreover, the economy has been transformed
into a guided missile on target.
So, there's the apparent answer to what's
going on with the U.S. economy, the European Union economic problems, and
probably what's on the financial radar screen for Japan and China, two of
the world's most prolific economies.
China is the world's second largest
economy after the USA. Japan is the third largest economy in the world.
Fukushima just may ruin Japan's economy if
there are more radioactive problems that TEPCO can't deal with and the
government of Japan has to step in and take over.
Maybe that's why the Japanese government
is letting TEPCO handle the 'cleanup'?
Now that we've learned that the economy is part of the "silent weapon
technology" in the "Quiet War," do you think there will ever be a peace
armistice? With the
real estate bubble burst in 2007-09 that
helped lead to the never-ending recession.
The
stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent hits in 1987, 2000, and 2008; it
would appear that we are due for another financial 'hit' or "projectile" of
some sort, if the "Quiet War" is to remain on target.
-
Could the next "silent weapon" come from
the insurance world, e.g., sticker shock that healthcare insurance
consumers are experiencing?
-
With five million healthcare insurance
policy cancellations rendered and replacement policies that will
cost anywhere from double to quadruple premiums. Doesn't that sound
like healthcare insurance is a targeted projectile in the "Quiet
War"?
-
What projectiles can we, the citizens,
send back?
Complaints, more and louder
complaints to members of Congress, Letters
to the Editors of newspapers and, of course, to the White House.
Comments can be telephoned to the White
House switchboard at 202-456-1111.
As this writer sees it, voters have been asleep at their voting booth
levers. We need to wake up and not be ingrained in party politics. We need
to see the overall picture of what's going on rather than salute a party's
candidate.
They did that in Germany in the 1930s and look
what that got them. We did that in 2008 and 2012 and look what it's gotten
us! We can no longer take the party line as truth.
Look what the Democrats were able to pull off
with regard to the Affordable Care Act. It's anything but affordable.
Voters have to become educated - and real fast - otherwise, the controllers
will win the "Quiet War."
Human dignity and human compassion cannot
allow that to happen in the USA, in the European Union, nor anywhere.
What will you do?
