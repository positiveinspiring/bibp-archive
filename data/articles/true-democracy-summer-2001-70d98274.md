CIA's Directorate for Science and Technology
This agency gathers information with promise for scientific and technological
developments which present a superiority advantage for a threat against,
the National Security, [also contains the "Weird Desk", which centrally processes
intelligence about UFOs and ETs and their interaction with Earth], current
Deputy Director of Central Intelligence for Science and Technology is
Ron Pandolfi.
We we know what National Security means, not the definition the government
wants you to know but the reality and we know that many people around the
world don't want the military involved with extraterrestrial beings and "Star
Wars" kinds of activities, so let's have Mr. Pandolfi perform some other
profession and end this program.
