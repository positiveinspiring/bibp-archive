# Is India's 100 Smart Cities Project a Recipe for Social Apartheid?

In architectural renderings,
Gujarat International Financial Tec-City (GIFT
City) resembles a thicket
of glassy blue skyscrapers soaring above the Sabarmati River in
Gandhinagar, capital of the western Indian state of Gujarat.
Its "signature towers" include the
Diamond, a 410-metre spire resembling an icy stalagmite, and the
362m Gateway Towers, a bendy, sinuous version of
Rem Koolhaas's CCTV headquarters in Beijing.
By 2021, the creators of Gift City,
as it is commonly known, promise to surround these towers with
world-class infrastructure which will provide residents with
round-the-clock power and water, a "district-cooling system"
that sluices chilled water through buildings, and an automatic
garbage disposal system sending excrement hurtling through
sewage pipes at 90kph - "faster than most Indian trains", as the
journalist
Manu Joseph
dryly observed.
The beating heart - or rather, robot
brain - of Gift City is its "Command and Control Centre", which
keeps traffic moving smoothly and monitors every building
through a network of CCTVs.
In a country where more than 300
million people live without electricity, and twice as many don't
have access to toilets, Gift City's towers sound like
hypertrophic castles in the sky.
But they are an essential part
of the Indian government's urban vision, one that it wants to
see replicated a
hundred times across the country.
Recently, the Indian cabinet
green-lit a £10 billion scheme that will be divided equally
between building 100 smart cities, and rejuvenating another 500
cities and towns over the next five years.
Yet many experts and planners fear
that such "insta-cities", if they are made, will prove dystopic
and inequitable.
Some even hint that smart cities may turn into
social apartheid cities, governed by powerful corporate entities
that could override local laws and governments to "keep out" the
poor.
In a monograph for a
conference on
Smart
Cities in Mumbai in January, the economist
and consultant Laveesh Bhandari described smart cities
as,
"special enclaves" that would
use prohibitive prices and harsh policing to prevent
"millions of poor Indians" from "enjoying the privileges of
such great infrastructure".
"This is the natural way of
things," he noted, "for if we do not keep them out, they
will override our ability to maintain such infrastructure."
Bhandari's bald statements
sparked social-media pandemonium, and the economist is now
at pains to assert he is far from uncritical of such plans.
"I am describing the
unfeasibility and undesirability of a thoughtless smart-city
vision," he says.
"When you invest so much without thinking
about services and low-cost housing and governance, then you
will end up creating enclaves that keep out the poor."
In their present form, Bhandari
adds, smart cities are essentially rechristened Special Economic
Zones (SEZs); neo-liberal
business-friendly zones exempt from taxes, duties and
stringent labour laws.
They are also subject to what urban
scholars say is a form of "privatized governance", due to
a constitutional amendment that renders local governments
powerless.
All of which, according to
Bhandari, makes them inherently and unreservedly exclusionary.
"The current template for smart
cities only mandates infrastructure creation. What we need
is democracy and rule of law, not governance by fiat that
holds in SEZs and smart cities
created in China."
Last July, Narendra Modi's newly
elected government allocated 70.6 billion rupees (£762m) to its
"100 Smart Cities" plan.
This year's allocation shrank to
1.4bn rupees, yet smart cities remain a key justification for a
controversial land-acquisition ordinance the government is
aiming to enact, which does away with mandatory consent and
social safeguards for those whose lands are forcibly acquired.
Over the past few months, smart
city-themed conferences have been taking place every week in
Delhi and Mumbai, culminating in the urban development minister
Venkaiah Naidu's announcement that the scheme would be "rolled
out" imminently.
Yet no one is quite sure of what
these cities might look like, or who they're for. Naidu, with
not a little wistfulness, said that smart cities,
"would have clean water, assured
power supply, efficient public transport and would not be
polluted or congested".
A
concept note from his ministry, last revised in December,
explains that they will,
"have smart (intelligent)
physical, social, institutional and economic
infrastructure", guaranteeing their residents employment
opportunities and "a very high quality of life, comparable
with any developed European city".
This repeated emphasis on high-end
infrastructure and superlative quality of life hints at a
discomfiting answer to the second question: who the intended
inhabitants of smart cities are likely to be.
The current template might have
given us
Palava City.
This self-described smart city across
3,000 acres of Mumbai's northeastern exurbs is being built by a
city-based developer best known for treating
skyscraper-erecting as a competitive sport. As its
promotional video
announces in a smug baritone, Palava City was inspired by
the futuristic vision that brought Singapore, Dubai "and even
Mumbai" into being.
What this translates into is
"essential public infrastructure" such as 24x7 electricity,
immaculate wide roads, public transport, malls, multiplexes and
luxury housing,
including "Mumbai's first and only golf-course-equipped
residential township".
To make sure that no one trespasses
on its immaculate privatopia, Palava plans to issue its
residents with "smart
identity cards", and will watch over them through a system
of "smart
surveillance".
The emphasis on surveillance
underlines the stratified, elitist nature of smart cities,
according to the academic and author Pramod Nayar.
"Smart cities will be heavily
policed spaces," he says, "where only eligible people -
economically productive consumers (shoppers) and producers
(employees) - will be allowed freedom of walking and travel,
while ambient and ubiquitous surveillance will be tracked so
as to anticipate the 'anti-socials'."
As such, Nayar adds, smart cities
will be,
"more fortresses than places of
heterogeneous humanity, because they are meant only for
specific classes of people".
One class to be served, the other to
be surveilled and contained.
"The smart city paradigm comes
from mid-scale European cities, and they're meant to make
existing infrastructure work in a more integrated way,
whether it's waste, habitation or transport connectivity,"
says Gautam Bhan, a researcher with the Indian Institute for
Human Settlements in Delhi.
"But Indian cities struggle with
the absence of networks. Just 16% of Indian cities
have underground sewage drainage systems. No technology can
make the system work better if basic services don't exist."
Set against this context, Gift City,
which
models itself after financial hubs
Canary Wharf in London
and
Paris's La Defense, starts to resemble the
Emerald City, a
glittering spectacle at the end of a shiny highway.
In India such cities - geared
towards high-end services - seem unlikely to provide many
meaningful livelihood opportunities in the rural hinterlands
where they come up.
"Having islands of well-serviced
smart cities amidst a vast sea of poorly-serviced and
impoverished villages leads to what urban scholars have
called the juxtaposition of the citadel and ghetto," says
Sai Balakrishnan, an urban scholar at Rutgers, who studies
land conflicts and urbanization in
India.
"If the government does succeed
in building these premium 100 smart cities, but does nothing
to alleviate poverty and poor services in the surrounding
areas, it could well lead to a politically volatile
situation. These visible forms of spatial inequalities
engender social mistrust and even violence."
Nowhere is this combination of
political volatility and spatial inequality more striking than
in the giant expressway projects snaking across the country's
hinterland since 2006.
These six-to-eight lane highways,
intended to thread together luxury townships and special
economic zones, often come up on fertile farmland that is
forcibly acquired under the pretext of fulfilling a "public
purpose".
In May 2011, one such project just
outside Delhi - involving an expressway, private sports-themed
city, and the country's first Formula 1 racetrack - led to
months-long protests among farmers from 10 villages.
The rally descended into violence
when villagers clashed with armed police, leading to the deaths
of two farmers and two policemen (read also
Not all manifestations of disquiet
end in gunshots and death, however.
Balakrishnan recounts an
incident that took place on the outskirts of Bangalore, where
villages are rapidly being replaced with
IT parks, gated communities and wealthy villas.
A friend returned to her "visibly
opulent" bungalow one evening to find a young man lounging on
her porch, drinking a cold beer from her fridge. When she took
out her phone to call the police, he brandished a small knife
and motioned for her to sit down.
She did, upon which he finished his
beer, thanked her politely and left.
"This incident makes palpable
the sense of resentment and alienation among those excluded
from partaking in India's new urban wealth," Balakrishnan
says.
"The young man wasn't out to
harm anyone, but he felt justified, entitled almost, to
break into an affluent home and to help himself to a few
hours of luxury."
Every new smart city, she suggests,
signals yet another,
"temporary secession, each of
them setting in place a new social order that will not be
easy to reverse, and that takes urban planning dangerously
away from the public domain".
A hundred smart cities could spawn a
thousand shadow cities, simmering with resentment and rage.
