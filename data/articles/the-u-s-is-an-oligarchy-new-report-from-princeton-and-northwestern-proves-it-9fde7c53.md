# The U.S. is an Oligarchy - New Report from Princeton and Northwestern 
Proves It

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_americanempire45.htm

Despite the seemingly strong
empirical support in previous studies for theories of majoritarian
democracy, our analyses suggest that majorities of the American
public actually have little influence over the policies our
government adopts.
Americans do enjoy many features central to
democratic governance, such as regular elections, freedom of
speech and association, and a widespread (if still contested)
franchise.
But we believe that if policymaking is dominated by
powerful business organizations and a small number of affluent
Americans, then America's claims to being a democratic society
are seriously threatened.
From a recent study
titled Testing
Theories of American Politics - Elites, Interest Groups, and
Average Citizens
by Martin Gilens of Princeton
University and Benjamin I. Page of Northwestern University
In response to the publication
of an academic study that essentially proves the United States
is nothing more than
an oligarchy, many commentators have
quipped sentiments that go something like "so tell me something
I don't know."
While I agree that the conclusion is far from
surprising to anyone paying attention, the study is significant
for two main reasons.
First, there is a certain
influential segment of the population which has a disposition
which requires empirical evidence and academic studies before
they will take any theory seriously. Second, some of the
conclusions can actually prove quite helpful to activists who
want to have a greater impact in changing things.
This shouldn't
be particularly difficult since their impact at the moment is
next to zero.
What is most incredible to me is
that the data under scrutiny in the study was from 1981-2002.
One can only imagine how much worse things have gotten since the
2008 financial crisis. The
study found that even when 80% of the population favored a
particular public policy change, it was only instituted 43% of
the time. We saw this first hand with the bankster
bailout in 2008, when Americans across the board were opposed to
it, but
Congress passed TARP anyway (although they had to
vote twice).
Even more importantly, several
years of supposed "economic recovery" has not changed the
public's perception of the bankster bailouts. For example, a
2012 study showed that only 23% percent of Americans favored the
bank bailouts and the disgust was completely bipartisan, as
the Huffington Post points out.
Personally, I think the banker
bailouts will go down as one of the most significant turning
points in American history.
Despite widespread disapproval,
Congress passed TARP and it was at that moment that many
Americans "woke up" to the fact they are nothing more than
economic slaves with no voice. That they are serfs.
Even more
importantly, once oligarchs saw what they could get away with
they kept doubling down and doubling down until we find
ourselves in the precarious position we are in today. A society
filled with angst and resentment at the fact that
the 0.01% have stolen everything.
Another thing that the study noted
was that average citizens sometimes got what they wanted, but
this is almost always when their preferences overlap with the
oligarchs. When this occurs it is entirely coincidental, and in
many cases may the result of public opinion being molded by the
elite-controlled special interest groups themselves.
How
pathetic...
I read the entire
42 page study and
have highlighted what I found to be the key excerpts below.
Please share with others and enjoy:
Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and
organized groups representing business interests have
substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while
average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or
no independent influence.
The results provide substantial support for theories of Economic
Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but not
for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian
Pluralism.
Until
very recently, however, it has been impossible to test the
differing predictions of these theories against each other
within a single statistical model that permits one to analyze
the independent effects of each set of actors upon policy
outcomes.
A major challenge to majoritarian pluralist
theories, however, is posed by Mancur Olson's argument that
collective action by large, dispersed sets of individuals with
individually small but collectively large interests tends to be
prevented by the "free rider" problem. Barring special
circumstances (selective incentives, byproducts, coercion),
individuals who would benefit from collective action may have no
incentive to personally form or join an organized group.
If everyone thinks this way and lets George do it, the job is
not likely to get done.
This reasoning suggests that Truman's
"potential groups" may in fact be unlikely to form, even if
millions of peoples' interests are neglected or harmed by
government. Aware of the collective action problem, officials
may feel free to ignore much of the population and act against
the interests of the average citizen.
As to empirical evidence concerning interest
groups, it is well established that organized groups regularly
lobby and fraternize with public officials; move through
revolving doors between public and private employment; provide
self-serving information to officials; draft legislation; and
spend a great deal of money on election campaigns.
Moreover, in
harmony with theories of biased pluralism,
the evidence clearly
indicates that most U.S. interest groups and lobbyists represent
business firms or professionals.
Relatively few represent the poor or even the economic interests
of ordinary workers, particularly now that the U.S. labor
movement has become so weak.
What
makes possible an empirical effort of this sort is the existence
of a unique data set, compiled over many years by one of us
(Gilens) for a different but related purpose: for estimating the
influence upon public policy of "affluent" citizens, poor
citizens, and those in the middle of the income distribution.
Gilens and a small army of research assistants gathered data on
a large, diverse set of policy cases: 1,779 instances between
1981 and 2002 in which a national survey of the general public
asked a favor/oppose question about a proposed policy change.
In
any case, the imprecision that results from use of our
"affluent" proxy is likely to produce underestimates of the
impact of economic elites on policy making. If we
find substantial effects upon policy even when using this
imperfect measure, therefore, it will be reasonable to infer
that the impact upon policy of truly wealthy citizens is still
greater.
Some particular U.S. membership organizations
- especially the AARP and labor unions - do tend to favor the same
policies as average citizens. But other membership groups
take stands that are unrelated (pro-life and pro-choice groups)
or negatively related (gun owners) to what the average American
wants.
Some membership groups may reflect the views of corporate
backers or their most affluent constituents.
Others focus on
issues on which the public is fairly evenly divided.
Whatever
the reasons, all mass-based groups taken together simply do not
add up, in aggregate, to good representatives of the citizenry
as a whole. Business-oriented groups do even worse, with a
modest negative over-all correlation of "10".
The estimated impact of average citizens'
preferences drops precipitously, to a non-significant, near-zero
level. Clearly the median citizen or "median voter" at the heart
of theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy does not do well
when put up against economic elites and organized interest
groups.
The chief predictions of pure theories of Majoritarian
Electoral Democracy can be decisively rejected.
Not only do ordinary citizens not have uniquely substantial
power over policy decisions; they have little or no independent
influence on policy at all.
By contrast, economic elites are estimated to
have a quite substantial, highly significant, independent impact
on policy. This does not mean that theories of Economic Elite
Domination are wholly upheld, since our results indicate that
individual elites must share their policy influence with
organized interest groups.
Still,
economic elites stand out as quite influential - more so than
any other set of actors studied here - in the making of U.S.
public policy.
The incredible thing here is that
they use the 90th percentile to gauge the "economic elite," when
we well know that it is the
"oligarchs" themselves and the businesses they run
that call all the shots. It would have been interesting if they
isolated the impact of the 0.01%.
These
results suggest that reality is best captured by mixed theories
in which both individual economic elites and organized interest
groups (including corporations, largely owned and controlled by
wealthy elites) play a substantial part in affecting public
policy, but the general public has little or no independent
influence.
In our 1,779 policy cases, narrow pro-change
majorities of the public got the policy changes they wanted only
about 30% of the time.
More
strikingly, even overwhelmingly large pro-change majorities,
with 80% of the public favoring a policy change, got that change
only about 43% of the time.
Amidst all of the bad news in this
study, there is one conclusion from which we can find a silver
lining.
The importance of business groups'
numerical advantage is also revealed when we rescale our
measures of business and mass-oriented interest group alignments
to reflect the differing number of groups in each of these
categories.
Using
this rescaled measure, a parallel analysis to that in table 4
shows that on a group-for-group basis the average individual
business group and the average mass-oriented group appears to be
about equally influential.
The greater total influence of
business groups in our analysis results chiefly from the fact
that more of them are generally engaged on each issue (roughly
twice as many, on average), not that a single business-oriented
group has more clout on average than a single mass based group.
Relatively few mass-based interest groups are active, they do
not (in the aggregate) represent the public very well, and they
have less collective impact on policy than do business-oriented
groups - whose stands tend to be negatively related to the
preferences of average citizens.
These business groups are far
more numerous and active; they spend much more money; and they
tend to get their way.
What the paragraphs above
demonstrate is that the public has become very, very bad at
organizing and that they aren't even in the same ballpark as the
the business groups. While mass-based interest groups will never
be able to compete financially, we now live in a world of
crowd-funding and a great deal of angst.
Thus, there appears to
be some low hanging fruit available for the activist community
to pick at and become more organized.
Furthermore, the preferences of economic elites
(as measured by our proxy, the preferences of "affluent"
citizens) have far more independent impact upon policy change
than the preferences of average citizens do.
To be
sure, this does not mean that ordinary citizens always lose out;
they fairly often get the policies they favor, but only because
those policies happen also to be preferred by the economically
elite citizens who wield the actual influence.
But sure, keep chanting USA! USA!
and keep sending your children to die overseas for no good
reason.
Of course our findings speak most directly to the
"first face" of power: the ability of actors to shape policy
outcomes on contested issues. But they also reflect - to some
degree, at least - the "second face" of power: the ability to
shape the agenda of issues that policy makers consider.
The set
of policy alternatives that we analyze is considerably broader
than the set discussed seriously by policy makers or brought to
a vote in Congress, and our alternatives are (on average) more
popular among the general public than among interest groups.
Thus the fate of these policies can reflect policy makers'
refusing to consider them rather than considering but rejecting
them. (From our data we cannot distinguish between the two.)
Our
results speak less clearly to the "third face" of power: the
ability of elites to shape the public's preferences.
We know
that interest groups and policy makers themselves often devote
considerable effort to shaping opinion. If they are successful,
this might help explain the high correlation we find between
elite and mass preferences. But it cannot have greatly inflated
our estimate of average citizens' influence on policy making,
which is near zero.
So what's the conclusion? Well we
aren't a Democracy and we aren't a Constitutional Republic. As I
and many others have noted, we have descended into something far
worse, an neo-feudalistic Oligarchy.
What do
our findings say about democracy in America? They certainly
constitute troubling news for advocates of "populistic"
democracy, who want governments to respond primarily or
exclusively to the policy preferences of their citizens.
In the United States, our findings indicate, the
majority does not rule - at least not in
the causal sense of actually determining policy outcomes. When a
majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with
organized interests, they generally lose.
Moreover, because of
the strong status quo bias built into the U.S. political system,
even when fairly large majorities of Americans favor
policy change, they generally do not get it.
A
possible objection to populistic democracy is that average
citizens are inattentive to politics and ignorant about public
policy; why should we worry if their poorly informed preferences
do not influence policy making?
Perhaps economic elites and
interest group leaders enjoy greater policy expertise than the
average citizen does. Perhaps they know better which policies
will benefit everyone, and perhaps they seek the common good,
rather than selfish ends, when deciding which policies to
support.
But we
tend to doubt it. We believe instead that - collectively - ordinary citizens generally know their own values and interests
pretty well, and that their expressed policy preferences are
worthy of respect.
Moreover, we are not so sure about the informational advantages
of elites.
Yes, detailed policy knowledge tends to rise with
income and status. Surely wealthy Americans and corporate
executives tend to know a lot about tax and regulatory policies
that directly affect them.
But how much do they know about the
human impact of Social Security, Medicare, Food Stamps, or
unemployment insurance, none of which is likely to be crucial to
their own well-being? Most important, we see no reason to think
that informational expertise is always accompanied by an
inclination to transcend one's own interests or a determination
to work for the common good.
All
in all, we believe that the public is likely to be a more
certain guardian of its own interests than any feasible
alternative.
Leaving
aside the difficult issue of divergent interests and motives, we
would urge that the superior wisdom of economic elites or
organized interest groups should not simply be assumed.
It should be put to empirical test. New empirical research will
be needed to pin down precisely who knows how much, and what,
about which public policies.
Our
findings also point toward the need to learn more about exactly
which economic elites (the "merely affluent"? the top 1%? the
top 0.01%?) have how much impact upon public policy, and to what
ends they wield their influence.
Similar questions arise about
the precise extent of influence of particular sets of organized
interest groups.
And we need to know more about the policy
preferences and the political influence of various actors not
considered here, including political party activists, government
officials, and other non-economic elites. We hope that our work
will encourage further exploration of these issues.
Despite the seemingly strong empirical support in previous
studies for theories of majoritarian democracy, our analyses
suggest that majorities of the American public actually have
little influence over the policies our government adopts.
Americans do enjoy many features central to democratic
governance, such as regular elections, freedom of speech and
association, and a widespread (if still contested) franchise.
But we believe that if policymaking is dominated by powerful
business organizations and a small number of affluent Americans,
then America's claims to being a democratic society are
seriously threatened.
So when
Sam Zell
or any other oligarch prances around on television
saying that the "poor should be more like the rich," what he's
really saying is you need to sell your soul and attempt to
become an oligarch. Otherwise, you're fucked...
This is a truly excellent study and
I suggest you
read the entire thing
here, if you have the time.
