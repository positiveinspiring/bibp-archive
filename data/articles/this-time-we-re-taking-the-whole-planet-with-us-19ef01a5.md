I have walked through the barren remains of
Babylon in Iraq and the ancient Roman city of Antioch, the
capital of Roman Syria, which now lies buried in silt deposits.
I have visited the marble ruins of Leptis Magna,
once one of the most important agricultural centers in the Roman Empire, now
isolated in the desolate drifts of sand southeast of Tripoli.
I have climbed at dawn up the ancient temples in
Tikal, while flocks of brightly colored toucans leapt through the jungle
foliage below.
I have stood amid the remains of the
ancient
Egyptian city of Luxor along the Nile, looking at the statue of
the great Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II lying broken on the ground, with
Percy Shelleys poem Ozymandias running through my head:
My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
Civilizations rise, decay and die.
Time, as the ancient Greeks argued, for
individuals and for states is cyclical. As societies become more complex
they become inevitably more precarious. They become increasingly vulnerable.
And as they begin to break down there is a strange retreat by a terrified
and confused population from reality, an inability to acknowledge the
self-evident fragility and impending collapse.
The
elites at the end speak in phrases and jargon that do not
correlate to reality.
They retreat into isolated compounds, whether at
the court at Versailles, the Forbidden City or modern palatial estates.
The elites indulge in unchecked hedonism, the
accumulation of vaster wealth and extravagant consumption. They are deaf to
the suffering of the masses who are repressed with greater and greater
ferocity.
Resources are more ruthlessly depleted until
they are exhausted. And then the hollowed-out edifice collapses. The Roman
and Sumerian empires fell this way. The Mayan elites, after clearing their
forests and polluting their streams with silt and acids, retreated backward
into primitivism.
As
food and
water shortages expand across the globe, as
mounting poverty and misery trigger street protests in the Middle East,
Africa and Europe, the elites do what all elites do.
They
launch more wars, build grander monuments
to themselves, plunge their nations deeper into debt, and as it all unravels
they take it out on the backs of workers and the poor.
The
collapse of the global economy, which wiped out a staggering $40
trillion in wealth, was caused when our elites, after destroying our
manufacturing base, sold massive quantities of fraudulent mortgage-backed
securities to pension funds, small investors, banks, universities, state and
foreign governments and shareholders.
The elites, to cover the losses, then
looted the public treasury to begin the speculation over again.
They also, in the name of austerity,
began dismantling basic social services, set out to break the last vestiges
of unions, slashed jobs, froze wages, threw millions of people out of their
homes, and stood by idly as we created a permanent underclass of unemployed
and underemployed.
The Mayan elite became, at the end, as the anthropologist Ronald Wright
notes in A
Short History of Progress,
extremists, or ultra-conservatives,
squeezing the last drops of profit from nature and humanity.
This is how all civilizations, including our
own, ossify and die.
The signs of imminent death may be undeniable.
Common sense may cry out for a radical new response. But the race toward
self-immolation only accelerates because of intellectual and moral
paralysis.
As Sigmund Freud grasped in Beyond the Pleasure
Principle and Civilization and Its Discontents, human societies are as
intoxicated and blinded by their own headlong rush toward death and
destruction as they are by the search for erotic fulfillment.
The unrest in
the Middle East, the implosion of national
economies such as those of Ireland and Greece, the increasing anger of a
beleaguered working class at home and abroad, the growing desperate human
migrations and the refusal to halt our relentless destruction of the
ecosystem on which life depends are the harbingers of our own collapse and
the consequences of the idiocy of our elite and the folly of globalization.
Protests that are not built around a complete
reconfiguration of American society, including a rapid dismantling of empire
and the corporate state, can only forestall the inevitable.
We will be saved only with the birth of a new
and militant radicalism which seeks to dethrone our corrupt elite from power,
not negotiate for better terms.
The
global economy is built on the erroneous
belief that the marketplace - read human greed - should dictate human
behavior and that economies can expand eternally.
Globalism works under the assumption that the
ecosystem can continue to be battered by massive carbon emissions without
major consequences. And the engine of global economic expansion is based on
the assurance that there will always be plentiful and cheap oil. The
inability to confront simple truths about human nature and the natural world
leaves the elites unable to articulate new social, economic and political
paradigms. They look only for ways to perpetuate a dying system.
Thomas Friedman and the array of other
propagandists for globalization make as much sense as Charlie Sheen.
Globalization is the modern articulation of
the ancient ideology used by past elites to turn citizens into serfs and the
natural world into a wasteland for profit. Nothing to these elites is
sacred. Human beings and the natural world are exploited until exhaustion or
collapse. The elites make no pretense of defending the common good. It is,
in short, the defeat of rational thought and the death of humanism.
The march toward self-annihilation has already
obliterated 90 percent of the large fish in the oceans and wiped out half of
the mature tropical forests, the lungs of the planet. At this rate by 2030
only 10 percent of the Earths tropical forests will remain.
Contaminated water kills 25,000 people every
day around the globe, and each year some 20 million children are
impaired by malnourishment.
Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere now are at
329 parts per million and climbing, with most climate scientists warning
that the level must remain below 350 ppm to sustain life as we know it. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
estimates that the measurement could reach 541 to 970 ppm by 2100.
At that point huge parts of the planet, beset
with overpopulation, droughts, soil erosion, freak storms, massive crop
failures and rising sea levels, will be unfit for human existence.
Jared Diamond in his essay The
Last Americans notes that by the time Hernan Cortés reached the
Yucatán, millions of Mayan subjects had vanished.
Why, Diamond writes, did the kings and
nobles not recognize and solve these problems? A major reason was that
their attention was evidently focused on the short-term concerns of
enriching themselves, waging wars, erecting monuments, competing with
one another, and extracting enough food from the peasants to support all
these activities.
Pumping that oil, cutting down those trees, and catching those fish may
benefit the elite by bringing them money or prestige and yet be bad for
society as a whole (including the children of the elite) in the long
run, Diamond went on.
Maya kings were consumed by immediate
concerns for their prestige (requiring more and bigger temples) and
their success in the next war (requiring more followers), rather than
for the happiness of commoners or of the next generation.
Those people with the greatest power to make
decisions in our own society today regularly make money from activities
that may be bad for society as a whole and for their own children; those
decision-makers include Enron executives, many land developers, and
advocates of tax cuts for the rich.
It was no different on
Easter Island.
The inhabitants, when they first settled the
64-square-mile island during the fifth century, found abundant fresh water
and woods filled with the Chilean wine palm, a tree that can reach the size
of an oak. Seafood, including fish, seals, porpoises and turtles, and
nesting seabirds were plentiful.
Easter Islands society, which split into an
elaborate caste system of nobles, priests and commoners, had within five or
six centuries swelled to some 10,000 people.
The natural resources were devoured and began to
disappear.
Forest clearance for the growing of crops
would have led to population increase, but also to soil erosion and
decline of soil fertility, Paul Bahn and John Flenley write in Easter
Island, Earth Island.
Progressively more land would have had to
be cleared. Trees and shrubs would also be cut down for canoe building,
firewood, house construction, and for the timbers and ropes needed in
the movement and erection of statues. Palm fruits would be eaten, thus
reducing regeneration of the palm. Rats, introduced for food, could have
fed on the palm fruits, multiplied rapidly and completely prevented palm
regeneration.
The over exploitation of prolific sea bird
resources would have eliminated these for all but the offshore islets.
Rats could have helped in this process by eating eggs. The abundant food
provided by fishing, sea birds and rats would have encouraged rapid
initial human population growth. Unrestrained human population increase
would later put pressure on availability of land, leading to disputes
and eventually warfare. Non-availability of timber and rope would make
it pointless to carve further statues.
A disillusionment with the efficacy of the
statue religion in providing the wants of the people could lead to the
abandonment of this cult. Inadequate canoes would restrict fishing to
the inshore waters, leading to further decline in protein supplies.
The result could have been general famine,
warfare and the collapse of the whole economy, leading to a marked
population decline.
Clans, in the later period of the Easter Island
civilization, competed to honor their ancestors by constructing larger and
larger hewn stone images, which demanded the last remnants of the timber,
rope and manpower on the island.
By the year 1400 the woods were gone. The soil
had eroded and washed into the sea. The islanders began to fight over old
timbers and were reduced to eating their dogs and soon all the nesting
birds.
The desperate islanders developed a belief system that posited that the
erected stone gods, the moai, would come to life and save them from
disaster. This last retreat into magic characterizes all societies that fall
into terminal decline. It is a frantic response to loss of control as well
as despair and powerlessness.
This desperate retreat into magic led to,
Civilizations in the last moments embrace a
total severance from reality, a reality that becomes too bleak to be
absorbed.
The modern belief by evangelical christians in the rapture, which
does not exist in biblical literature, is no less fantastic, one that at
once allows for the denial of global warming and of evolution and the absurd
idea that the righteous will all be saved - floating naked into heaven at
the end of time.
The faith that science and technology, which are
morally neutral and serve human ambitions, will make the world whole again
is no less delusional. We offer up our magical thinking in secular as well
as religious form.
We think we have somehow escaped from the foibles of the past. We are
certain that we are wiser and greater than those who went before us. We
trust naively in the inevitability of our own salvation. And those who cater
to this false hope, especially as things deteriorate, receive our adulation
and praise.
We in the United States, only 5 percent of the
worlds population, are outraged if anyone tries to tell us we dont have a
divine right to levels of consumption that squander 25 percent of the
worlds energy.
President Jimmy Carter, when he suggested
that such consumption was probably not beneficial, became a figure of
national ridicule. The worse it gets the more we demand illusionary
Ronald Reagan happy talk. Those willing to cater to fantasy and
self-delusion are, because they make us politically passive, lavishly funded
and promoted by corporate and oligarchic forces.
And by the very end we are joyfully led over the
cliff by simpletons and lunatics, many of whom appear to be lining up for
the Republican presidential nomination.
Are the events of three hundred years ago
on a small remote island of any significance to the world at large?
Bahn and Flenley ask.
We believe they are. We consider that
Easter Island was a microcosm which provides a model for the whole
planet. Like the Earth, Easter Island was an isolated system.
The people there believed that they were the
only survivors on Earth, all other land having sunk beneath the sea.
They carried out for us the experiment of permitting unrestricted
population growth, profligate use of resources, destruction of the
environment and boundless confidence in their religion to take care of
the future.
The result was an ecological disaster
leading to a population crash. A crash on a similar scale (60 percent of
the population) for the planet Earth would lead to the deaths of about
1.8 billion people, roughly 100 times the death toll of the Second World
War.
Do we have to repeat the experiment on this
grand scale? Do we have to be as cynical as Henry Ford and say History
is bunk? Would it not be more sensible to learn the lesson of Easter
Island history, and apply it to the Earth Island on which we live?
Human beings seem cursed to repeat these
cycles of exploitation and collapse.
And the greater the extent of the deterioration
the less they are able to comprehend what is happening around them. The
Earth is littered with the physical remains of human folly and human hubris.
We seem condemned as a species to drive ourselves and our societies toward
extinction, although this moment appears be the denouement to the whole sad
show of settled, civilized life that began some 5,000 years ago.
There is nothing left on the planet to seize.
We are now spending down the last remnants of
our natural capital, including our forests, fossil fuel, air and water.
This time when we go down it will be global. There are no new lands
to pillage, no new peoples to exploit. Technology, which has obliterated the
constraints of time and space, has turned our global village into a global
death trap.
The fate of Easter Island will be writ large
across the broad expanse of planet Earth.
