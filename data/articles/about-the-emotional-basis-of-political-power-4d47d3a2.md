Power Is Based On
Emotions
(Political power)
The nearest thing to this idea that you could find is the sentence of
Caligula:
"It doesn't matter that they hate us, as
long as they fear us".
He reveals that his power was based on the fear.
Michel Foucault said:
"Speech is power."
Of course, because it generates emotions.
In any organization, an individual of certain rank cannot take charge of all
personally, he or she should delegate, to make a subordinate to make some
things for him or her.
Therefore he or she order him or her to do something. But, how do he or she
make the subordinate to obey him / her?.
One can think of three Answers or answer Types.
-
Answer 1: he or she inspires him / her
an emotion that impels (moves) him / her to obey. Emotion comes from
the Latin root motere, to move.
-
Answer 2: he or she inspires greed to
him / her, he / she promises a recompense to him / her , or he or
she claims gratitude to him / her for a previous gift.
-
Answer 3: he or she appeals to the
ideology, to the honor, to the duty.
Frequently they combine these answers, like in
the Politics that has been called "of the Stick (punishment) and the Carrot
(reward)."
About the ideology, we are also manipulated through the lie, because we
allow it when we don't value the truth above everything else, above all
ideology, when we accept without questioning a "rational" explanation more
ridiculous that what is sought to deny.
It is Hypnotic
We allow it when instead of reasoning, analyzing the information that emits,
we prejudge their source, and, according to whether we like it or not, we
accept or we reject all what it says, but without reasoning, without
filtering their speech, without separating the truths from the lies in it.
If we prejudge a source as "not reliable" we ignore all what it says,
including the truths. If not, we accept all what it says and we ignore
everything else, like in the hypnosis, we allow to that reliable source to
think for us, and to tell us what to think and what to believe.
Hypnosis is done when we allow our masters,
self-proclaimed "reliable" sources, the only ones "serious", the only
"experts", make us to ignore all what their "adversaries", the other
sources, say.
They do this by disqualifying to their
adversaries:
"We are the good guys, they are the bad
guys. Don't listen to them, they are extremists, they are credulous,
they aren't serious, they aren't impartial, they aren't experts, they
are lying, they are jokers, they are enemies, they are mad, they are
bad, they are crazy, they are freaks, they are irrational, they are
this, they are that, etc.".
They surely can't be all that at the same time.
They speak about the adversary source, not about what it says, so they
pretend that we prejudge the source, not to judge what it says. The
"adversary" source is attacked just because it says its truth, its reality,
how it see the reality. Reality is somehow subjective, so the masters try to
impose us their reality and to make us ignore other realities.
As in the known game "Simon says", they pretend
that we must obey all what Simon says and to ignore all what any other says.
It is an hypnotic manipulation of the reality, our reality (subjective), but
only if we allow it.
It is our election. It is like magic, an
illusion that is real if we choose it so.
Doesn't matter whether a source is "reliable" or not. Indeed, the source
doesn't matter at all, never. What matters is the information what it emits.
Truth never depends on the source. There is no warranty. All sources can
emit a mixture of truths and lies, consciously or unconsciously, voluntarily
or not, deliberately or not, innocently or not. This mixture can have more
or less truths than lies, but is always a mixture.
By example, 500 year ago, the "experts", the
reliable sources, said that the Earth is flat. That was the Paradigm in that
time. What many adopted then as their "truth", now is a lie. As science
advance (if we allow it), paradigms change. And vice-versa, we must allow
that paradigms be improved to allow science progress.
We should listen to all sources, we should be
open to all them, "reliable" and "not reliable", "serious" or not, "experts"
or not, and to filter what they say by our own common sense, to separate
from it, from that mixture, what we choose to believe, what we adopt as
truth, from what we choose to not believe, what are lies for us.
No matter what, nothing is true for us until we
choose it, and we choose it when it fits in our concept of reality, our
mental jigsaw-puzzle, our mental map of reality, our subjective reality.
We choose all, our reality, our future, our destiny, all the time.
But there is a time limit and a default choice.
We allow ourselves to be deceived when we don't reason for ourselves.
To reason is to choose what to believe, it is to look for the truth, and it
should be a permanent attitude. Only when one is choosing what to believe
one is reasoning. When one already chose, one isn't reasoning, one has
confidence (from the Latin fides, faith), having faith, in what one chose
before, what one already incorporated to their mental map of the reality
(subjective), their mental jigsaw-puzzle. A faith that can be so irrational
whether it is deposited in a "scientific" dogma as in one religious. In the
point where we are reasoning, where we are choosing what to believe (in what
to have faith), in that point, the reason isn't incompatible with the faith,
but complementary.
We don't reason when we dismiss too quickly the new information, without
thinking, without asking us the question of gold: And if it was certain?.
When new information doesn't fit in our jigsaw-puzzle because it contradicts
something that we believe, something that we trust, we should solve the
contradiction, either dismissing the new information, or the old one that
before we believed true and now we think that it is not.
Not to solve the contradiction would be
Doublethink , it would be to have a divided mind, double or multiple,
maintaining in it a disordered jigsaw-puzzle, or more than one, with pieces
that don't coincide, contradictory ideas in order that one can appeal to one
or the other according to the occasion, the convenience.
But that it is another topic.
Demagoguery
The Answer 2 is related to Demagoguery.
"If you want to calm the hunger of a man for
one day, give him a fish (demagoguery, to lead people, if you want to
dominate them, to tame them as if they were animals). If you want to
calm the hunger of a man for all their life, teach him to fish
(pedagogy, to lead the child, to educate him, it implies compassion, the
genuine will of helping him that is absent in the demagoguery)".
It usually includes also the deceit that the
demagogue is the only supplier possible of what the subordinate needs.
Two Types Of Emotions
Returning about the emotions, you can distinguish two types of emotions,
those that unite people and those that separate them (fear, hate, guilt,
shame, all expressions or derivatives of the fear).
The emotions move the world and the incorrect emotions are moving it in the
wrong way, toward the self-destruction.
Traditionally the power has been based on the emotions that separate (Divide
and you shall rule).
Power is understood as the capacity to cause suffering.
With that concept of the power you cannot solve the problems, because you
would lose power. Are those problems (war, terrorism, hunger, misery,
unemployment, crime, drugs, contamination, etc.), that suffering, that makes
people to go to their leaders (the same ones that created those problems)
for protection. Those problems are the source of their power, the suffering
generates the emotions of which that power feeds himself.
So the problems are not solved but rather they are increased with
counterproductive "solutions", until everything explodes in some crisis of
some type (a world war, for example).
Counterproductive
Solutions
You can easily recognize a counterproductive solution because it doesn't
attack the cause of the problem, only the effects, the consequences. It is
as a defensive reaction, but without a counteroffensive (a counterattack) or
a preventive action, in such a way that it is never enough, it is always
overloaded, it is always one step behind. It doesn't do nothing to eliminate
the problem, it cohabits with it as if it was playing an eternal ping pong
game, as the other side of the same coin, it needs it in order to justify
its existence. It doesn't solve nothing and so it worsens the problem.
People who doesn't think very much believes that
everything what is done to solve a problem serves, that everything is
useful, that the only important is that something is being done, no matter
what. But it is not. Some people don't think, they only obey. So they can
deceive them in their face, at full daylight, by making them believe that
they are working really hard to solve the problem but they can't do it
because of misfortune, not for stupidity or incompetence, or pure
wickedness.
Perhaps they indeed work hard, but on the wrong
point, miles away from the right point, knowingly.
So the only thing that they need to do is not to look for the truth, the
true cause of the problem. You can't effectively combat what you can't
understand. If they suspect that the cause, the truth, is at an address,
they go to the opposite address.
Groucho Marx said:
"Politics is the art of looking for the
problems, to make a false diagnostic and applying the wrong remedies".
One could change "looking for the problems" by
"creating the problems".
Frequently, those who cause the problem and those who work on the
counterproductive solution are what
David Icke
calls "oppo-sames": they simulate to be the opposite, but they
are the same. They are violent, authoritarian extremists, from opposed
extremes, who simulate to fight each other, but they don't strike each other
directly, they strike to innocent people, not extremists but moderate
people, from the opposite side ("enemies") or from their own side
("traitors"), in order to force to the people to align to one extreme or the
other. They attack the society in a movement of pincers.
At the highest level they are controlled by the
same leaders, they obey to the same head, in such a way that whether some
day the fight finishes, it doesn't matter who wins, everybody ends under the
same authoritarian command. They don't strike each other directly because
they know they are the same, they need each other in order to justify their
existence, they fortify each other. So they take care of each other.
They aren't good guys and bad guys, they are the
same, different sides of the same coin, they work together,
coordinated, for our education. Ones push us and the others pull us, but
both in the same direction, toward our wisdom. (See below)
A classic example of counterproductive solution is to increase the controls,
to give more power to the leaders and less freedom to the people, to oversee
more and more the people. But, at the same time that you do this, you make
sure that you and your friends have privileges, safe-conducts that allow you
to avoid these controls, to cross them unpunished, in such a way that you
continue harming the society in spite of them.
Otherwise it would break the vicious circle and
they would no longer be needed more and more controls. At the end, you have
so many laws, commandments and regulations limiting the people's freedom
(but not your freedom), and they are so complex, that only an expert can
understand them because each rule has its exception, so that you can apply
them arbitrarily, so that the laws are only applied to powerless people and
the exceptions to you and your friends, without nobody opposes because
nobody understands them.
Two thousand years ago the Romans said:
"the law is a spider's web that catches the
flies and it allows to pass the birds."
People must learn to behave by their own choice,
their free will, not because of surveillance or fear of punishment. This
forced behavior wouldn't be truly good, it would disappear when surveillance
fails.
Effective Solutions
On the other hand, you also can easily recognize an effective solution
because it starts, after a reasonable time, to improve constantly the
situation and it does never stop until the problem disappears, or almost.
The only thing what you need to do is to oversee the effects of your
solutions. What can't be measured, can't be controled, in the same way that
you can't control the people what you don't oversee.
A classic example of an effective solution is the education. This
make sense if indeed one lives to learn. Education is always the best
strategy, because if you dig deeply enough when you look for the root of a
problem, you always find ignorance.
And Ho Chi Minh said:
"If the tactical is right but the strategy
is wrong, you can win some battles but you'll lose the war. If the
strategy is right but the tactical is wrong, you can lose some battles
but you'll win the war."
That is, you can work to solve a problem, as
reacting to an emergency, but you must never lose of view the strategy of
long term.
Ordo Ab Chaos
If it's so easy to distinguish the effective solutions from the
counterproductive ones, you can only conclude that they choose the
counterproductive ones on purpose.
Lenin said:
"So much worse, so much better".
To more chaos, better for his revolution. There
is an old Masonic motto, "Ordo ab Chaos", Order from the Chaos, you
create the chaos and then impose the order, your order, an order to your
convenience, more power for you and less freedom for the people. David
Icke calls this method as "Problem-Reaction-Solution".
But your order can not be good, your solutions
can not be effective, because that would break the vicious circle.
The Method Of The
Python
With each crisis what they create as an excuse, they obtain more power by
reducing still more the freedom of the people.
Their method resembles that of the python snake (If you read "The
Biggest Secret" by David Icke, this seems very
appropriate. See also in the Bible, the Book of Revelation or Apocalypse,
Chapter 20, Verse 2). Each time that its victim exhale, the python presses
its chest a little more, so the next time that it inhales it can't expand
its chest as before, so it takes less air each time.
The goal seems to be the total control of the world, a world dictatorship.
The consequence of a power based on the fear is a government based on the
fear, a dictatorship. By reading the novel
1984, from George Orwell, you can get an
idea about how this society could be.
Sometimes, especially in the economy, it's more like a pendulum whose
displacement from the vertical line diminish more and more while its energy
dissipates, because every time that they reach a crisis, they stop and they
choose an opposite politics or way of thinking and acting.
As a pendulum, they react to each crisis by
stopping and choosing an opposite counterproductive solution and they go
toward the next crisis in the opposite direction. But they never choose
effective solutions, only counterproductive ones. So, at the end, the
pendulum will stop in its balance point, the vertical line, the control
of the entire world.
They call this as Cycles.
They are as the cycles in the graphic of a wave
that attenuates as its energy dissipates and its amplitude is smaller and
smaller, until the line is flat, the control of the world.
What Is All This
About?
All this could sound bizarre, if you dare to call bizarre to such things as
God, the Bible, and religion, because about those is all this. But indeed,
if you read between lines the last book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation
(Apocalypse) you can find a global dictatorship, a police state, the
government of the Antichrist.
And if you read "Pawns
in the Game" from the former British Intelligence's agent
William Guy Carr, and "The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and
Montesquieu" from Maurice Joly, you can find detailed plans to attain
this by means such as world wars and revolutions, as those instructions in
"The Prince" from Niccolo Machiavelli, but more ambitious.
You can't ignore such things as "The Prince",
what has been the Politicians' Bible for 500 years (you probably cannot
understand Politics without reading it), you must take this seriously.
Forcing the Apocalypse
It is as if these leaders were trying to follow the Book of Revelation
as a script, as a guide, as if they were trying to force the coming of this
world government.
Who better than the devil and the Antichrist could personify and symbolize
the evil and, for us, the fear, the power of fear?. That is this all here
about.
Some authors say that the concept of Satan
is closely related to the ancient Egyptian god Set (who they say is
still worshipped today inside some secret societies) who tries to stop the
evolution of man by keeping him in the ignorance, according to the Egyptian
Mythology. Some other say that the name comes from a word what means
deceiver, or from a word what means obstacle, the obstacle in the man's way
toward God, the obstacle what interposes between man and God.
All these are appropriate.
According to the book from William Carr, those who carry out the plans to
conquer the world are worshipers of Lucifer.
The Letters From
Albert Pike To Giuseppe Mazzini
Surprisingly, the book "Pawns in the Game", from William Guy Carr, includes
the transcription of several letters dated between 1859 and 1871, from
Albert Pike to the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Mazzini, which
contain detailed plans for three (3) major world wars, each one followed by
one major revolution.
What is more surprising is that two of these
wars (First and Second World Wars, 1914-1919 and 1939-1945) and two of these
revolutions (the Russian and the Chinese ones) happened in the century XX
almost exactly as supposedly they would have been planned, according to
these letters.
Each war would plant the seed of the following
one, it would prepare its road. If this is true, it would still remain the
third ones (the Third World War and the next revolution), so this is
extremely serious, so that it is worthwhile to investigate this seriously.
Some "experts" have hurried too much to dismiss this as a hoax,
hysterically, suspiciously, but these letters would really fit in the
overall context, this make perfect sense. You should only read the work of
Maurice Joly, of the year 1864, to see how the plans detailed there
have been executed since then. However, Joly doesn't speak of wars,
revolutions, nor Satanism, but about how to control the information, the
press, the public opinion, Politics, the economy, etc., about how to
exploit the debilities of democracy to destroy it and to impose a
dictatorship, what he calls "new order".
Apparently, when Carr's book was written, the year 1958, this letters were
at the British Museum in London, England, and then, one day, they
disappeared, suspiciously. This is most serious because they were tangible
evidence (one of many) of a conspiracy.
According to the book "The Biggest Secret", from David Icke, pages
193 to 195, these two men, Pike and Mazzini, were heavily involved in the
planning of the American Civil War, along with many other known leading
Freemasons.
Albert Pike, with the title of Sovereign Grand Commander, was
the head of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry
in the United States in the second half of century XIX, while Giuseppe
Mazzini was the head of the Italian Grand Orient Freemasonry, out
of which is alleged that emerged the Mafia.
Pike, author of "Morals
And Dogma", an alleged Luciferian Satanist who believed in the
Aryan Master Race, changed the name of the Knights of the Golden
Circle, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, a crucial Elite group behind the
Civil War, after this organization, funded by the London Freemasonic
bankers, was exposed at the conspiracy trial into Abraham Lincolns death in
Indianapolis in June 1865, along with some of the people named there as
directly involved:
-
Lord Palmeston, the British Prime
Minister and 33rd degree Freemason who died in that same year
-
John Wilkes Booth, 33rd degree Freemason
selected by the Knights to kill Lincoln
-
Judah P. Benjamin, the voice of the
London Freemason bankers who ordered the assassination
-
Jacob Thompson, a former Secretary for
the Interior, who withdrew U$D180,000 from the Bank of Montreal in
Canada to bankroll the operation
The new name chosen by Pike for the Knights of
the Golden Circle was Ku ux Klan, or Ku Klux Klan, from the Greek word
kuklos, circle.
The infamous outlaw, Jesse James, a 33rd degree Mason assigned by
Albert Pike to rob banks in the north to further fund the war, was a Knight
of the Golden Circle. Another one was the Freemason, General P. T.
Beauregard, who started the Civil War with an attack on Fort Sumter in 1861.
Pike's friend and oppo-same, Mazzini, started in 1851 to establish groups
across America which began to campaign against slavery. The Freemasons used
these groups as the cover for the true motivation behind the Civil War.
"Young America" lodges were organized to do this and their headquarters was
at the Cincinnati Lodge No 133. Their main funding came from the British
Freemasonic banker and Rothschild frontman called George Peabody and
he appointed J. P. Morgan senior to handle the funds in America.
Morgan, was a stooge for Daniel Payseur.
One of the most famous voices against slavery was John Brown, who
became a legend through the song about "John Browns body". Brown, in fact,
was a member of a number of secret societies, including the Freemasons. He
became a Master Mason at the Hudson Lodge No 68 in Hudson, Ohio, on May 11th
1824, and was a member of Mazzinis Young America. Brown was funded by the
John Jacob Astor family.
The funding for the southern rebellion was arranged through London Masonic
bankers by Caleb Cushing, who was operating in the north.
Franklin Pierce (the bloodline of George and Barbara Bush) was
elected President in 1853 and Mazzini wrote that:
"almost all his nominations are such as we
desired."
One of these "nominations" was the appointment
by Pierce of Caleb Cushing as his Attorney General. Cushing was controlled
by English Freemasonry and connected to the British opium trade to China
through his ship-owner father and his cousin, John Perkins Cushing. Caleb
Cushing wrote extensively against slavery and became the architect, with
Pike, of the Civil War. Oppo-sames.
Freemasons have been also heavily involved in the American Revolution, the
American War of Independence, and every Latino-american war of independence
against Spain.
If this is true, these men have the required experience to plan wars and
revolutions.
The book "Hitler Won The War", from the Argentinean economist Walter
Graziano, speaks about a planned future war against China for the year
2010.
According to Carr's book, Pikes plan was as simple as it has proved
effective. He required that Communism, Nazism, Political Zionism, and other
International movements be organized and used to foment the three global
wars and three major revolutions. The first world war was to be fought so as
to enable the Illuminati to overthrow the
powers of the Tzars in Russia and turn that country into the stronghold of
Atheistic-Communism. The differences stirred up by agentur of the
Illuminati
between the British and German Empires were to be used to foment this war.
After the war ended, Communism was to be built up and used to destroy other
governments and weaken religions.
Suggestively, Illuminati means "the enlightened ones", while
Lucifer means "the bearer of light".
World War Two, was to be fomented by using the differences between Fascists
and Political Zionists. This war was to be fought so that Nazism would be
destroyed and the power of Political Zionism increased so that the sovereign
state of Israel could be established in Palestine. During world war two
International Communism was to be built up until it equaled in strength that
of united Christendom. At this point it was to be contained and kept in
check until required for the final social cataclysm.
World War Three is to be fomented by using the differences that
the agents of the Illuminati stir up between Political Zionists and the
leaders of the Moslem world. The war is to be directed in such a manner
that Islam (the Arab World including Mohammedanism) and Political Zionism
(including the State of Israel) will destroy themselves while at the same
time the remaining nations, once more divided against each other on this
issue, will be forced to fight themselves into a state of complete
exhaustion physically, mentally, spiritually and economically.
On August 15, 1871, Pike told Mazzini that after World War Three is ended,
those who aspire to undisputed world domination will provoke the greatest
social cataclysm the world has ever known.
This extremely severe chastisement is exactly the same method as that used
to tame an animal, according to "The Brainwashing Manual", by Lafayette
Ronald Hubbard, synthesis of the Russian textbook on Psychopolitics
, just that instead of applying it to only one individual, they torture to
all the Mankind.
They don't consider to the Man as a spiritual
being having an physical experience, but just an animal with a big brain, a
big intelligence but without heart, without soul. So they treat Man as an
animal to be tamed.
Life is Energy
They are Materialists. They deny the existence of soul, indeed they deny the
existence of all but material things, all but what can be perceived by the
senses directly or by means of instruments.
But the senses and instruments are limited. A living being isn't made only
of matter, it has warm, it has movement, that is to say, it has energy also.
The difference between an alive cell and a dead one that has recently died,
it is the energy. Both have the same matter, the same molecules, the same
atoms, the same substances, but the alive cell has an energy that lacks in
the dead one.
So one can reasonably conclude that this difference between them, this
energy, is life. Life is a form of energy. Moreover, life is a conscious
form of energy. It's conscious enough to realize that for preserve itself it
needs to take energy from the environment (to feed itself).
Like the soul, the energy of life, named Qi by the Chinese, Ki by the
Japanese and Kundalini by the Hindu, is indestructible, according to the
Principle of Conservation of Energy, of Physics. So, it exists, and why
can't we name it soul?.
We are talking here about the politic aspect of Power, but in Physics, Power
relates closely to Energy: Power is the change of Energy divided by the
Time. If life is energy, and the political power is based on suffering, this
power changes negatively the energy of life, because is demonstrated that
suffering shortens life.
Dr Candace Pert, of the Georgetown
University, of Washington, D.C., USA, found chemical connections among the
mind and the body that show that it is impossible to have a thought of any
class that doesn't cause physical changes. This topic, is it treated in the
semi-documental movie on Quantum Physics named "What the Bleep Do We Know?"
(2006).
The peptides produced in the Hypothalamus (the
region of the brain investigated by the Dr José Delgado in his works
about
mind control), are liberated in the blood
flow when emotions occur, and they couple more and more to specific
receivers in the exterior of the cellular wall, impeding more and more the
access of the cell to the necessary nutrients, what produces its aging
("negative" emotions).
Isn't Bizarre?
Many of us have a manipulated, artificial, false, irrational concept of what
is bizarre and what is not. This is because we don't think enough, we choose
to believe in lies, as it was already stated above. This is because we allow
it. We have allowed millennia of censorship and denial of the truth. To deny
the truth and to censor, to ourselves or to others, is the same. If we
censor, or we allow censorship, that censorship will turn against us,
against our own freedom. Censorship leads to dictatorship. Nobody lives
happy in a dictatorship, everybody lives with fear, so even those who work
for the dictatorship are betrayed by it, because it's based on lies.
Incredible isn't equal to false. Extraordinary isn't
impossible. Unusual isn't unreal.
Many times we discover that what we've thought true is false, and vice
versa. Those times, reality is usually stranger than fiction because reality
is not as they try to make us believe.
Surely, there is not nothing so false as the official version of the things
(official history, official news, official "science"). It should not be this
way, but it is, sadly, because we have allowed it.
Mark Twain said:
"When your opinion coincides with that of
the majority, it's time to reconsider it".
Especially we have allowed ourselves to be
deceived in momentous, vital questions, that concern to our survival like
species, because they concern to both, our origin and our destiny, those
what have been reviled and ridiculed with such appellatives as Supernatural
or Paranormal, Mystic, Mythology, Esoteric and Occult, those what taught,
secretly, the Invisible College of Oxford.
These are questions about which the "scientists"
don't want to arrive to the truth, but maintaining the status quo, to
perpetuate the ignorance, in such a way that they will destroy all evidence
presented to them and then they will say "there are not evidences" (there is
not worse blind man that the one that doesn't want to see).
They include such things as
Angels and Extraterrestrials (they
could be the same with different names, as says
Zecharia Sitchin,
Giorgio Bongiovanni, and many others), Ghosts, Reincarnation or
Life After Death, God and Religion, Metaphysics (partly known now as
Quantum Physics or Quantum Mechanics),
Prophecies, Dowsing, Divination,
Magic, Witchcraft, Satanism, and
Conspiracy Theories.
What Are They Doing
Right Now?
Seemingly, since half century ago they have been developing, secretly, a
technology to track the people, a
microchip that
would also allow to control the emotions of the people in those that are
implanted, at least since the Spanish doctor's works, Dr. Jose Manuel
Rodriguez Delgado, in the decade of 1950, inventor of the stimoceiver
and author of the book "Physical Control Of The Mind: Toward to
Psychocivilized Society", editorial Harper & Row, NY, 1969, available,
partly, in
http://www.angelfire.com/or/mctrl/delgado.htm.
Some authors say that this microchip would be the Apocalypse's Mark of the
Beast.
Nothing that it is good and decent would be
allowed in a society like this, because the positive emotions that it would
generate would not fit in it.
If the power is based on emotions and if was unavoidable that all
civilizations reach in some point of its development a such technology that
allows it such an absolute power that it even allows it to control the
population's emotions, what emotions would be allowed and which not?.
The answer to that question will depend on its degree of moral and spiritual
evolution, since that determines the use that will be given to that
technology. The technology is a tool, it isn't good neither bad by itself,
that depends of who it uses it and for what.
The advances in an area of the knowledge and the human activity depend on
the progress in other areas. We are all interdependent. Everything is
related to everything else, and a backwardness in the moral or spiritual
aspect brakes our development in the other areas (even the technology) in
such a way that it makes to be in danger our own survival like species, when
diminishing our capacity to survive an eventual (to very long term,
unavoidable) planetary catastrophe. But this is also another topic.
That society, as the one described in 1984, would be the expression of the
bad side of all the things because in it there isn't anything good and true,
and it would be based on two main pillars: the fear and the lie.
Both can be combated efficiently with
education.
Levels Of The Human
Necessities
(Human Rights)
The suffering is generated by preventing the people to satisfy their
necessities.
In 1984 the war is used to maintain people in the misery, by destroying the
fruit of its work (the war is destructive, obviously), and the misery is
used to maintain the inequality, and the inequality is used to maintain the
power. The power is the ultimate goal of the governing class, not a means to
accomplish something, not even benefits, because although they have more
privileges than the majority, all they live worse every time, as the time
passes. According to the book (it is reasonable), technical progress stops
(as it was already said, that threatens the survival of the human species).
It is only the power for the power, without any other reason.
From
1984 one can
deduct that people are maintained in the misery so that they only worry to
survive each day and be not interested in more momentous matters, all they
related ones to each other and with our individual and collective survival:
the future, the politics, the morality, the religion and the spirituality,
the wisdom, the art (the necessity of expression), etc.
They know that before worrying about those high matters, people must satisfy
their more basic necessities, so they make all the effort so that they are
not able to make it.
The necessities (sometimes they are called Human Rights) of the people can
be divided in levels, such that, before somebody worries about the superior
levels, he / she should have satisfied the inferior ones, at least partly.
It is a simple matter of priorities.
The lower levels are those what link us to the Earth, to the physical world,
to the mortal biological life. The upper last levels are those what link us
to the God, to the Universe, to Heaven, to the eternal life.
Level 1
The first level is that of the basic necessities for life (the body),
for the biological survival, to continue breathing: air (obvious),
water, food, clothes, housing, security (to maintain the physical
integrity), etc. This is what keeps us alive.
It is hardly in this level that they seek to maintain people, by trying
to make that they cannot satisfy these necessities fully, so that they
hardly survive enough to serve to the governing class, but not more.
But to survive is not to live. To survive is hardly to breathe. To live
is to enjoy. The World Health Organization simply defines that state as
Health, full psychophysical health.
In fact, one could believe that the Buddhists say that to breathe and to
enjoy life should be synonymous, and that the secret of the happiness is
to be satisfied with very little, to the degree of being satisfied just
with to breathe, in a state of grace, of ecstasy, of peaceful
contemplation, marveling in each opportunity, as a little child, with
the beauty of the world, as if this was discovered for the first time,
being happy and grateful just by being alive and emptying the mind of
all desire and emotion (emotions again, in the Spanish language there
isn't great difference between the definition of desire and that of
emotion). Of course, this requires of a lot of practice and some minimum
conditions (a minimum of food, of water, of clothes, etc.).
But, for most of us, to live requires of satisfying other necessities.
Level 2
The following level to satisfy are the sexual necessities (the couple).
This give us a reason to live. So we have all type of obstacles to
impede that they be satisfied, as much as it be possible without it was
evident. We have the false morality, the false dogmas of the false
religion, etc. If you think it, you realize this.
We say that "not only of bread the Man
lives", or like the French say, "eat, drink and be happy, because
tomorrow we will die." With that "be happy", or when one eats up in
excess or there are dysfunctions of the feeding (obesity, bulimia,
anorexia, etc.), or when what one drinks is not to calm the thirst of
the level 1, for example alcohol, we speak of necessities of level 2 and
superior.
All the addictions could be, mostly or
completely, inferior substitutes of a satisfactory sexuality.
By the way, Michel Foucault said:
"When that private becomes public, the
public thing becomes private."
When the attention is focused in the private
affairs of people, when what everybody oversee are the private
behaviors, the public affairs get lost of view, they stop to oversee the
government, they lose the control on what the Big Brother is doing. To
oversee private behaviors is a typical counterproductive solution.
Level 3
The third level is that of the affective necessities (the family). This
give us more reasons, reasons to sustain our own life to be able to
sustain others. So all the effort is made to separate people, to
separate the brothers, to the friends, to the parents of the children,
etc. Negative emotions are generated. To distinguish them in function of
the people's union or separation, we can call them negative to those
that separate to the people (different forms of the fear: fear itself,
hate, guilt, shame, etc.) and positive to those that unite them
(different forms of the love: romantic, filial, fraternal love,
friendship, charity, compassion, etc.).
In fact, we cannot say that an emotion is
negative. It has an useful function: to alert that there is a problem.
Level 4
The fourth level could be the necessity to serve (the community), of
helping the neighbor, the social need of being accepted in the society,
of fitting in it, of belonging to it, the vocation of service, the
charity, what corresponds to the chakra of the heart. This is the
boiling surface, the barrier, the limit that you need to have enough
energy to overcome in order to get eternal life.
So that whenever it is possible they try to
deny to the people their place in the world, to exclude them, to
discriminate against them.
Level 5
The fifth level would be the necessity of expression, of creating art,
of teaching what has been learned, of saying, what corresponds to the
chakra of the throat. This is where you live to inspire to others. So
they censure and they impose silence and secrecy.
Level 6
The sixth level would be the necessity to learn, of seeing, of knowing,
of being educated, what corresponds to the chakra of the center of the
forehead or of the third eye. So they combat the education to try to
perpetuate the ignorance.
Why the need to teach is lower than (precedes) the need to learn?. Would
not it maybe be logical that it was on the contrary, that you first
learn and later do teach?. Because, when you teach, your unconscious,
your immortal soul, assimilate, it memorizes, it incorporates, what it
learned, in such a way that is easier for it to conserve it when you
die, is easier for you to carry it with you to a new life when you
reincarnate, is easier for your unconscious to remind it. If you cannot
remember, you cannot learn and that is the reason of your existence.
When you teach something, you really think a
lot about that, you can dream of that, what indicates that your
unconscious learns it. It is as when one memorizes better something when
one writes it down. It is only when you teach that you are really ready
to learn more, to learn new things or to learn old things better.
Level 7
The seventh level would be the necessity to come closer to God, or the
Universal Intelligence, or as you want to call Him, of communion, of
religion, of some spiritual practice, what corresponds to the chakra of
the crown. Etcetera.
Toward the Pathocracy
Pathocracy (from the Greek pathos: illness, and kratos:
government) is the government of the ill people, the government of the
insane people, according to the Polish researcher Andrew M. Lobaczewski
in his book "Politic
Ponerology".
Ponerology (from the Greek poneros:
evil, and logos: study) is the study of evil. Pathocracy is the
result of a process of Ponerization of the society, de hysterization of the
society.
Note that the concept of hysteria has been
always related to a deficient sexuality, so this validates the concept of
Orgonomy, from
Wilhelm Reich
(1897-1957), disciple of Sigmund Freud.
Examples of Pathocracy are the Nazi Germany
of Adolf Hitler and the Soviet Union of Joseph Stalin.
These leaders that make an effort so that people cannot satisfy their
necessities are, in fact, psychopaths, since they are unable to feel
compassion for those of their own species, as if they do not consider
themselves part of it. Compassion is what make us humans. For that reason
one could think that they are not totally human in the sense that we give to
the word human (that opposite to inhuman).
They can be human on the outside, but not
completely human on the inside. Their law is the Law of the Strongest, the
Law of the Jungle, the law of the animals. As animals, they flee from the
stronger but they attack the weaker. For us, humans, that is Cowardice by
definition.
They can have a totally human physical body, but
inside it a divided mind, double or multiple (in 1984 Doublethink), partly
not human, a possessed mind (MPD, Multiple Personality Disorder, or DID
Dissociative Identity Disorder, different, modern, psychological names for
the same thing, the ancient concept of demonic possession of the faith, a
spiritual disease, in definitive, psychopaths).
They have a perspective of the life that is animal and Darwinist, based on
the wildest competition, not in the collaboration, the cooperation and the
solidarity. It is the survival of the fittest, not the survival of the
wisest. An example of this are Adam Smith's economic theories that are still
the paradigm of the economy, although the mathematical genius, and Nobel
Prize, John Nash demonstrated mathematically half century ago they are
mistaken, that is possible to obtain a better society for everyone by means
of the cooperation, a fact that has been maintained neatly outside of the
academic scope in economy, maintained in secret as much as it is possible.
(See the book "Hitler won the war", of the Argentinean economist Walter
Graziano).
Then, seeing the life as a competition, they think that as worse it is for
the neighbor, so much better for them, and they believe that the neighbor
thinks the same of them, they see the neighbor as a reflection from
themselves. For that reason, they fear the neighbor. The fear is the emotion
that dominates them. Perhaps they have been educated to fear since they were
children (perhaps even since before being born), by means of tortures and
verbal, physical, sexual and psychological abuse, to dominate them, to
enslave them, to transform them into marionettes, because the strings that
move them are made of fear.
This is what
Fritz Springmeier
and Cisco Wheeler say in their books "The Illuminati Formula Used to Create an
Undetectable Total Mind Controlled Slave" and "Deeper Insights into the
Illuminati Formula", where they describe a method of mind control
much older, perhaps millennial, and much more sophisticated that the
Brainwashing Manual of Hubbard.
They provide deliberately enormous suffering to big fringes of the
population for money and for power.
They sacrifice the neighbor, literally, in all the meaning of the word
sacrifice, specially the religious one. It works for them. They get what
they wish in exchange for their offering of human blood. They are rewarded
for spilling people's blood in wars, crime, terrorism, etc. Harm is
rewarded. Money is at harm's service. Look at the economy. There are,
everywhere, harmful activities that are very profitable, many of them legal.
At the same time that they provide suffering to the people, they are
providing them, unconsciously, an educational experience.
All This Is About Our
Education
Some authors say that life is a learning process, in fact through many lives
(reincarnation).
One lives to learn and, basically, there are two ways to do it:
understanding what it is being tried to teach us (metaphysics, compassion,
wisdom) or experiencing in flesh and blood the consequences of not doing it
(the already mentioned suffering). It is our election, our free will.
Everything could be better, if there were not people dedicated to harm to
other people for money or for power, or simply to satisfy their own
necessities. However, everything is exactly as it must be so that we learn
of the consequences of our errors. It is necessary that everything be as it
is. Indeed, there aren't good guys and bad guys, angels and demons, heroes
and villains. They are all actors playing a role, as we are, everyone. There
can't be an hero without a villain. They are the same, different sides of
the same coin, they work together, coordinated, for our education. Ones push
us and the others pull us, but both in the same direction, toward our
wisdom.
All what happens in our life, individually or collectively, is consequence
of our previous decisions. Sometimes that is called karma. What we sow is
what we harvest. What we give comes back to us as a boomerang, but
amplified, multiplied.
Each one chooses what he or she wants to believe, as well as he / she
chooses what wants to think, how he / she wants to feel and about what he /
she wants to be informed or to learn.
And he / she will endure the consequences of
their election, either good or not.
What To Do
From the reading of this text it should be obvious that we first need to
educate ourselves, we need to learn about those momentous questions, those
about which we have been kept ignorant so long, because this matters are at
the origin of all the problems what threaten our individual and collective
survival.
In second place, we must be responsible. We must not surrender to fear. Fear
doesn't allow to think. It triggers automatic, instinctive behaviors. Fear
transform us in animals.
That is what they want, to stop our evolution.
We must think, to think more, to think better.
We must reason. We must choose better, more carefully, what to believe. We
must not believe, automatically, all what says some authority, some
"reliable" source. We must analyze the information, not to prejudge the
source.
We must never censure, nor to allow censorship. If we are editors,
publishers, or something like that, we must reserve a special section or to
put a warning for challenged sources and controversial information, but not
censure them, so that the readers or viewers can read or see this
information and to judge it by themselves, by filtering it by their own
common sense, while they are aware of its character of challenged or
controversial. If we are only readers or viewers, we must demand that this
be done. There must be not taboo sources and subjects. We can't censure
something true just because is used as a kind of flag by some extremist
group.
We must not allow the abuse of Copyright for censorship. By example,
in an article, a link to a web page what violate some Copyrights is not
itself (the link) a violation of Copyright. The author of the article is not
responsible for the contents of the pages addressed by the links in the
article. A link to a web page is not an unauthorized reproduction of
Copyrighted material.
You can easily recognize some abuses of
Copyright when some people challenge or disqualify a source with any
excuse, any bad label, but then they are the first ones in claiming for the
defense of that source's Copyright. It's a little contradictory (Doublethink).
They are obviously trying to prevent the access
of other people to that source's material, censuring it under the guise of
"Copyright protection".
-
We must always keep ourselves in search
of the truth. If we know that any source is disqualified with any
excuse, with any bad label, we should try to know what it say to
filter this by our own common sense, not to allow that who
disqualify that source, by putting those label to it, to think for
us, to decide which information can we read and which not.
-
We must be open to all sources and trust
in our own common sense, not other's one.
-
We must never tolerate lies and
contradictions, specially in those momentous questions, specially in
public affairs, specially from our leaders and authorities.
-
We must defend freedom and the right to
privacy.
-
We must oversee our leaders and their
decisions, we must make sure that they are motivated by positive
emotions, by compassion, that is that they are truly interested in
solving the people's problems, and that their solutions reflect this
by having measurable positive effects, that is that they are not
based on the criterion "so worse, so better".
-
We must make sure that the causes of the
problems are investigated, and that the solutions that are applied
really act on them.
-
We must make sure that they understand
well the causes of the problems, otherwise they would be as blind
boxers throwing blows in the darkness.
-
We must demand that these causes be well
explained to us, satisfactorily.
