U.N. Rings The Alarm 12/26/1995
In their book The Healing Planet - Strategies For Resolving The Environmental Crisis, Paul and Anne Ehrlich write:
"In this century, humanity has become a truly planetary ecological force, its effects going far beyond the transformation of the landscape to include altering the composition of the atmosphere globally, interfering with planetary nutrient cycles, modifying climate, and exterminating other life forms. In historical perspective, the switch - from a modest to an overwhelming scale of impact, and from a positive to a negative impact on carrying capacity - was almost instantaneous and monumental: human activities now appear to be lowering the long-term carrying capacity and incurring risks on a scale unimaginable less than a lifetime ago."
And, also, later in the book:
"Controlling population growth is critical. We cannot emphasize too strongly that significant resources must be directed into programs that limit population growth both in the United States and abroad. Because of the built-in time lags, unless the surge in human numbers is halted soon and a gradual population shrinkage begun, there is no hope of solving the problems discussed in this volume."
"Controlling population growth is critical. We cannot emphasize too strongly that significant resources must be directed into programs that limit population growth both in the United States and abroad.
Because of the built-in time lags, unless the surge in human numbers is halted soon and a gradual population shrinkage begun, there is no hope of solving the problems discussed in this volume."
From the environmental impact side of the discussion, the Ehrlichs write:
Measured by commercial energy use, each American, on average, causes some 70 times as much environmental damage as a Ugandan or Laotian, 20 times that of an Indian, 10 times that of a Chinese, and roughly twice that of citizens of Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, or Australia. Americans use about 50 percent more commercial energy than Soviet citizens, (who nonetheless have caused even more havoc by using it with minimum efficiency and virtually no effort to prevent environmental damage). In terms of per-capita energy use, only Canada, Luxembourg, and a few oil producers are really in our league.Viewed in this light, the United States is the worlds most overpopulated nation. It is the worlds fourth largest nation in population, now numbering more than a quarter-billion people, and the average American consumes more of Earths riches than an average citizen of any of the other "big ten" nations ... Because of this combination of a huge population, great affluence, and damaging technologies, the United States has the largest impact of any nation on Earths fragile environment and limited resources.

ECO-92 ... EARTH CHARTER
(SEPT. 20, 1991)
In September 1991, as a preliminary to the United Nations "Earth Summit" Conference held in Brazil in 1992, the United Nations Associations of the United States, Canada, and Iowa sponsored a Midwest Public Hearing in Des Moines, Iowa.
At the Iowa Hearing, held in co-operation with the Secretariat of the U.N. Conference in Brazil, a rather startling document was circulated privately to some of the officials.
It reveals U.N. thinking on world population.
The time is pressing. The Club of Rome was founded in 1968, Limited To Growth was written in 1979, but insufficient progress has been made in population reduction. Given global instabilities, including those in the former Soviet bloc, the need for firm control of world technology, weaponry, and natural resources is now absolutely mandatory. The immediate reduction of world population, according to the mid-1970s recommendations of the Draper Fund, must be immediately effected. The present vast overpopulation, now far beyond the world-carrying capacity, cannot be answered by future reductions in the birth rate due to contraception, sterilization, abortion, but must be met in the present by the reduction in the numbers presently existing. This must be done by whatever means necessary. The issue is falsely debated between a political and a cultural approach to population and resources, when in fact, faced with stubborn obstruction and day-to-day political expediency which make most of the leaders of the most populous poor countries unreliable, the issue is compulsory cooperation. Compulsory cooperation is not debatable with 166 nations, most of whose leaders are irresolute, conditioned by localist cultures, and lacking appropriate notions of the New World Order. Debate means delay and forfeiture of our goals and purpose.

Compulsory cooperation is not debatable with 166 nations, most of whose leaders are irresolute, conditioned by localist cultures, and lacking appropriate notions of the New World Order. Debate means delay and forfeiture of our goals and purpose.
This same document directs that the following policy must be implemented:
The Security Council of the United Nations, led by the Anglo-Saxon Major Nation powers, will decree that henceforth the Security Council will inform all nations that its sufferance on population has ended, that all nations have quotas for reduction on a yearly basis, which will be enforced by the Security Council by selective or total embargo of credit items of trade including food and medicine, or by military force, when required. The Security Council of the U.N. will inform all nations that outmoded notions of all national sovereignty will be discarded and that the Security Council has complete legal, military, and economic jurisdiction in any region in the world and that this will be enforced by the Major Nations of the Security Council. The Security Council of the U.N. will take possession of all natural resources, including the watersheds and great forests, to be used and preserved for the good of the Major Nations of the Security Council. The Security Council of the U.N. will explain that not all races and peoples are equal, nor should they be. [Sounds remarkably similar to George Orwells Animal Farm.] Those races proven superior by superior achievements ought to rule the lesser races, caring for them on sufferance that they cooperate with the Security Council. Decision making, including banking, trade, currency rates, and economic development plans, will be made in stewardship by the Major Nations. All of the above constitute the New World Order, in which Order, all nations, regions and races will cooperate with the decisions of the Major Nations of the Security council.

The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that action delayed could well be fatal. All could be lost if mere opposition by minor races is tolerated and the unfortunate vacillations of our closest comrades is cause for our hesitations. Open declaration of intent followed by decisive force is the final solution.
This must be done before any shock hits our financial markets, tarnishing our credibility and perhaps diminishing our force.

UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE
...ON ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
On December 22, 1989, Resolution 44/228 titled United Nations Conference On Environment and Development, was adopted without a vote. This resolution called for the Earth Summit which was held in Brazil in 1992, and called for Earth Day on June 5, 1992. Lets look at the contents of this tremendously important, yet little known, U.N. resolution.
[Note - I realize that most "resolutions" are pretty dry reading. Not so in this case - well, maybe a little. Read along and be surprised at the broad, sweeping impact this has on everyone. Due to the importance and scope of the resolution, Ive decided to include most of the document here.]:
Recalling its resolution 43/196 of 20 Dec. 1988 on a United Nations conference on environment and development,Taking note of decision 15/3 of 25 May 1989 of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program 161/[A/44/25] on a United Nations conference on environment and development,Taking note also of Economic and Social Council resolution 1989/87 of 26 July 1989 on the convening of a United Nations conference on environment and development,Taking note of Economic and Social Council resolution 1989/101 July 1989 entitled "Strengthening international co-operation on environment: provision of additional financial resources to developing countries",Recalling also General Assembly resolution 42/186 of 11 Dec. 1987 on the Environmental Perspective of the Year 2000 and Beyond, and resolution 42/187 of 11 Dec. 1987 on the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, 162/[A/42/427],Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the question of the convening of a United Nations conference on environment and development, 163/[A/44/256/1989/66],Mindful of the views expressed by Governments in the plenary debate held at its forty-fourth session on the convening of a United Nations conference on environment and development,Recalling the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. 164/,Deeply concerned by the continuing deterioration of the state of the environment and the serious degradation of the global life-support systems, as well as by trends that, if allowed to continue, could disrupt the global ecological balance, jeopardize the life-sustaining qualities of the Earth and lead to an ecological catastrophe, and recognizing that decisive, urgent and global action is vital to protecting the ecological balance of the Earth,Recognizing the importance for all countries of the protection and enhancement of the environment,Recognizing also that the global character of environmental problems, including climate change, depletion of the ozone layer, transboundary air and water pollution, the contamination of the oceans and seas and degradation of land resources, including drought and desertification requires actions at all levels, including the global, regional and national levels and involving the commitment and participation of all countries,Gravely concerned that the major cause of the continuing deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of production and consumption, particularly in industrialized countries,Stressing that poverty and environmental degradation are closely interrelated and that environmental protection in developing countries must, in this context, be viewed as an integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in isolation from it,Recognizing that measures to be undertaken at the international level for the protection and enhancement of the environment must take fully into account the current imbalances in global patterns of production and consumption,Affirming that the responsibility for containing, reducing and eliminating global environmental damage must be borne by the countries causing such damage, must be in relation to the damage caused and must be in accordance with their respective capabilities and responsibilities, [based on Ehrlichs statement above, this sounds a lot like America will pay for it]Recognizing the environmental impact of material remnants of war and the need for further international co-operation for their removal, Stressing the importance for all countries to take effective measures for the protection, restoration and enhancement of the environment in accordance, inter alia, with their respective capabilities, while at the same time acknowledging the efforts being made in all countries in this regard, including international co-operation between developed and developing countries,Stressing the need for effective international co-operation in the area of research, development and application of environmentally sound technologies,Conscious of the crucial role of science and technology in the field of environmental protection and of the need of developing countries, in particular, concerning favorable access to environmentally sound technologies, processes, equipment and related research and expertise through international co-operation designed to further global efforts for environmental protection, including the use of innovative and effective means,Recognizing that new and additional financial resources will have to be channeled to developing countries in order to ensure their full participation in global efforts for environmental protection, Decides to convene a United National Conference on Environment and Development of two weeks duration and at the highest possible level of participation to coincide with World Environment Day, 5 June 1992; Accepts with deep appreciation the generous offer of the Government of Brazil to host the Conference; Affirms that the Conference should elaborate strategies and measures to halt and reverse the effects of environmental degradation in the context of strengthened national and international efforts to promote sustainable and environmentally sound development in all countries; Affirms that the protection and enhancement of the environment are major issues that affect the well-being of peoples and economic development throughout the world; Also affirms that the promotion of economic growth in developing countries is essential to address problems of environmental degradation; Further affirms the importance of a supportive international economic environment that would result in sustained economic growth and development in all countries for protection and sound management of the environment; Reaffirms that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the applicable principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their environmental policies, and also reaffirms their responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and the need for States to play their due role in preserving and protecting the global and regional environment in accordance with their capacities and specific responsibilities; Affirms the responsibility of States for the damage to the environment and natural resources caused by activities within their jurisdiction or control through transboundary interference, in accordance with national legislation and applicable international law; Notes that the largest part of the current emission of pollutants into the environment, including toxic and hazardous wastes, originates in developed countries, and therefore recognizes that those countries have the main responsibility for combating such pollution; Stresses that large industrial enterprises, including transnational corporations, are frequently the repositories of scarce technical skills for the preservation and enhancement of the environment, conduct activities in sectors that have an impact on the environment and, to that extent, have specific responsibilities and that, in this context, efforts need to be encouraged and mobilized to protect and enhance the environment in all countries; Reaffirms that the serious external indebtedness of developing countries, and other countries with serious debt-servicing problems, has to be addressed efficiently and urgently in order to enable those countries to contribute fully and in accordance with their capacities and responsibilities to global efforts to protect and enhance the environment; Affirms that in the light of the above, the following environmental issues, which are not listed in any particular order of priority, are among those of major concern in maintaining the quality of the Earths environment and especially in achieving environmentally sound and sustainable development in all countries: Protection of the atmosphere by combating climate change, depletion of the ozone layer and transboundary air pollution Protection of the quality and supply of freshwater resources Protection of the oceans and all kinds of seas, including enclosed and semi-enclosed seas, and of coastal areas and the protection, rational use and development of their living resources Protection and management of land resources by, inter alia, combating deforestation, desertification and drought Conservation of biological diversity Environmentally sound management of biotechnology Environmentally sound management of wastes, particularly hazardous wastes, and of toxic chemicals, as well as prevention of illegal international traffic in toxic and dangerous products and wastes Improvement of the living and working environment of the poor in urban slums and rural areas, through eradicating poverty, inter alia by implementing integrated rural and urban development programs, as well as taking other appropriate measures at all levels necessary to stem the degradation of the environment Protection of human health conditions and improvement of the quality of life Emphasizes the need for strengthening international co-operation for the management of the environment to ensure its protection and enhancement and the need to explore the issue of benefits derived from activities, including research and development, related to the protection and development of biological diversity; Reaffirms the need to strengthen international co-operation, particularly between developed and developing countries, in research and development and the utilization of environmentally sound technologies; Decides that the Conference, in addressing environmental issues in the development context, should have the following objectives: To examine the state of the environment and changes that have occurred since the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and since the adoption of such international agreements as the Plan of Action to Combat Desertification, 165/[1977-A/Conf. 74/36] the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, adopted on 22 March 1985, and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, adopted on 16 September 1987, taking into account the actions taken by all countries and intergovernmental organizations to protect and enhance the environment To identify strategies to be coordinated regionally and globally, as appropriate, for concerted action to deal with major environmental issues in the socio-economic development processes of all countries within a particular time-frame To recommend measures to be taken at the national and international levels to protect and enhance the environment, taking into account the specific needs of developing countries, through the development and implementation of policies for sustainable and environmentally sound development with special emphasis on incorporating environmental concerns in the economic and social development process, and of various sectorial policies and through, inter alia, preventive action at the sources of environmental degradation, clearly identifying the sources of such degradation and appropriate remedial measures, in all countries To promote the further development of international environmental law, taking into account the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on Human Environment, 166/ [U.N. pub. sales no. E.73.II.A.14] as well as the special needs and concerns of the developing countries, and to examine, in this context, the feasibility of elaborating general rights and obligations of States, as appropriate, in the field of the environment, also taking into account relevant existing international legal instruments To examine ways and means further to improve co-operation in the field of protection and enhancement of the environment between neighboring countries with a view to eliminating adverse environmental effects To examine strategies for national and international action with a view to arriving at specific agreements and commitments by Governments for defined activities to deal with major environmental issues, in order to restore the global ecological balance and to prevent further deterioration of the environment, taking into account the fact that the largest part of the current emission of pollutants into the environment, including toxic and hazardous wastes originates in developed countries, and therefore recognizing that those countries have the main responsibility for combating such pollution To accord high priority to drought and desertification control and to consider all means necessary, including financial, scientific and technological resources, to halt and reverse the process of desertification with a view to preserving the ecological balance of the planet To examine the relationship between environmental degradation and the structure of the international economic environment, with a view to ensuring a more integrated approach to environment-and-development problems in relevant international forums without introducing new forms of conditionality To examine strategies for national and international action with a view to arriving at specific agreements and commitments by Governments and by intergovernmental organizations for defined activities to promote a supportive international economic environment that would result in sustained and environmentally sound development in all countries, with a view to combating poverty and improving the quality of life, and bearing in mind that the incorporation of environmental concerns and considerations in development planning and policies should not be used to introduce new forms of conditionality in aid or in development financing and should not serve as a pretext for creating unjustified barriers to trade To identify ways and means to provide new and additional financial resources, particularly to developing countries, for environmentally sound development programs and projects in accordance with national development objectives, priorities and plans and to consider ways of establishing effective monitoring of the implementation of the provision of such new and additional financial resources, particularly to developing countries, so as to enable the international community to take further appropriate action on the basis of accurate and reliable data To identify ways and means to provide additional financial resources for measures directed towards solving major environmental problems of global concern and especially to support those countries, in particular developing countries, for whom the implementation of such measures would entail a special or abnormal burden, in particular owing to their lack of financial resources, expertise or technical capacity To consider various funding mechanisms, in eluding voluntary ones, and to examine the possibility of a special international fund and other innovative approaches, with a view to ensuring the carrying out, on a favorable basis, of the most effective and expeditious transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries To examine with the view to recommending effective modalities for favorable access to, and transfer of, environmentally sound technologies, in particular to the developing countries, including on concessional and preferential terms, and for supporting all countries in their efforts to create and develop their endogenous technological capacities in scientific research and development, as well as in the acquisition of relevant information, and, in this context, to explore the concept of assured access for developing countries to environmentally sound technologies in its relation to proprietary rights with a view to developing effective responses to the needs of developing countries in this area To promote the development of human resources, particularly in developing countries, for the protection and enhancement of the environment To recommend measures to Governments and the relevant bodies of the United Nations system, with a view to strengthening technical co-operation with the developing countries to

Decides to convene a United National Conference on Environment and Development of two weeks duration and at the highest possible level of participation to coincide with World Environment Day, 5 June 1992;
Accepts with deep appreciation the generous offer of the Government of Brazil to host the Conference;
Affirms that the Conference should elaborate strategies and measures to halt and reverse the effects of environmental degradation in the context of strengthened national and international efforts to promote sustainable and environmentally sound development in all countries;
Affirms that the protection and enhancement of the environment are major issues that affect the well-being of peoples and economic development throughout the world;
Also affirms that the promotion of economic growth in developing countries is essential to address problems of environmental degradation;
Further affirms the importance of a supportive international economic environment that would result in sustained economic growth and development in all countries for protection and sound management of the environment;
Reaffirms that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the applicable principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their environmental policies, and also reaffirms their responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and the need for States to play their due role in preserving and protecting the global and regional environment in accordance with their capacities and specific responsibilities;
Affirms the responsibility of States for the damage to the environment and natural resources caused by activities within their jurisdiction or control through transboundary interference, in accordance with national legislation and applicable international law;
Notes that the largest part of the current emission of pollutants into the environment, including toxic and hazardous wastes, originates in developed countries, and therefore recognizes that those countries have the main responsibility for combating such pollution;
Stresses that large industrial enterprises, including transnational corporations, are frequently the repositories of scarce technical skills for the preservation and enhancement of the environment, conduct activities in sectors that have an impact on the environment and, to that extent, have specific responsibilities and that, in this context, efforts need to be encouraged and mobilized to protect and enhance the environment in all countries;
Reaffirms that the serious external indebtedness of developing countries, and other countries with serious debt-servicing problems, has to be addressed efficiently and urgently in order to enable those countries to contribute fully and in accordance with their capacities and responsibilities to global efforts to protect and enhance the environment;
Affirms that in the light of the above, the following environmental issues, which are not listed in any particular order of priority, are among those of major concern in maintaining the quality of the Earths environment and especially in achieving environmentally sound and sustainable development in all countries:
Protection of the atmosphere by combating climate change, depletion of the ozone layer and transboundary air pollution
Protection of the quality and supply of freshwater resources
Protection of the oceans and all kinds of seas, including enclosed and semi-enclosed seas, and of coastal areas and the protection, rational use and development of their living resources
Protection and management of land resources by, inter alia, combating deforestation, desertification and drought
Conservation of biological diversity
Environmentally sound management of biotechnology
Environmentally sound management of wastes, particularly hazardous wastes, and of toxic chemicals, as well as prevention of illegal international traffic in toxic and dangerous products and wastes

Emphasizes the need for strengthening international co-operation for the management of the environment to ensure its protection and enhancement and the need to explore the issue of benefits derived from activities, including research and development, related to the protection and development of biological diversity;
Reaffirms the need to strengthen international co-operation, particularly between developed and developing countries, in research and development and the utilization of environmentally sound technologies;
Decides that the Conference, in addressing environmental issues in the development context, should have the following objectives:
To examine the state of the environment and changes that have occurred since the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and since the adoption of such international agreements as the Plan of Action to Combat Desertification, 165/[1977-A/Conf. 74/36] the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, adopted on 22 March 1985, and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, adopted on 16 September 1987, taking into account the actions taken by all countries and intergovernmental organizations to protect and enhance the environment
To identify strategies to be coordinated regionally and globally, as appropriate, for concerted action to deal with major environmental issues in the socio-economic development processes of all countries within a particular time-frame
To recommend measures to be taken at the national and international levels to protect and enhance the environment, taking into account the specific needs of developing countries, through the development and implementation of policies for sustainable and environmentally sound development with special emphasis on incorporating environmental concerns in the economic and social development process, and of various sectorial policies and through, inter alia, preventive action at the sources of environmental degradation, clearly identifying the sources of such degradation and appropriate remedial measures, in all countries
To promote the further development of international environmental law, taking into account the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on Human Environment, 166/ [U.N. pub. sales no. E.73.II.A.14] as well as the special needs and concerns of the developing countries, and to examine, in this context, the feasibility of elaborating general rights and obligations of States, as appropriate, in the field of the environment, also taking into account relevant existing international legal instruments
To examine ways and means further to improve co-operation in the field of protection and enhancement of the environment between neighboring countries with a view to eliminating adverse environmental effects
To examine strategies for national and international action with a view to arriving at specific agreements and commitments by Governments for defined activities to deal with major environmental issues, in order to restore the global ecological balance and to prevent further deterioration of the environment, taking into account the fact that the largest part of the current emission of pollutants into the environment, including toxic and hazardous wastes originates in developed countries, and therefore recognizing that those countries have the main responsibility for combating such pollution
To accord high priority to drought and desertification control and to consider all means necessary, including financial, scientific and technological resources, to halt and reverse the process of desertification with a view to preserving the ecological balance of the planet
To examine the relationship between environmental degradation and the structure of the international economic environment, with a view to ensuring a more integrated approach to environment-and-development problems in relevant international forums without introducing new forms of conditionality
To examine strategies for national and international action with a view to arriving at specific agreements and commitments by Governments and by intergovernmental organizations for defined activities to promote a supportive international economic environment that would result in sustained and environmentally sound development in all countries, with a view to combating poverty and improving the quality of life, and bearing in mind that the incorporation of environmental concerns and considerations in development planning and policies should not be used to introduce new forms of conditionality in aid or in development financing and should not serve as a pretext for creating unjustified barriers to trade
To identify ways and means to provide new and additional financial resources, particularly to developing countries, for environmentally sound development programs and projects in accordance with national development objectives, priorities and plans and to consider ways of establishing effective monitoring of the implementation of the provision of such new and additional financial resources, particularly to developing countries, so as to enable the international community to take further appropriate action on the basis of accurate and reliable data

AGENDA 21 - THE EARTH SUMMIT
In the book Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy To Save Our Planet, edited by Daniel Sitarz, we find:
Agenda 21 is, first and foremost, a document of hope. Adopted at the Earth Summit in Brazil [1992] by nations representing over 98% of the Earths population, it is the principal global plan to confront and overcome the economic and ecological problems of the late 20th century. It provides a comprehensive blueprint for humanity to use to forge its way into the next century by proceeding more gently upon the Earth. As its sweeping programs are implemented world-wide, it will eventually impact on every human activity on our planet. Deep and dramatic changes in human society are proposed by this monumental historic agreement. Understanding those changes is essential to guide us all into the future on our fragile planet. Humanity is at a crossroads of enormous consequence. Never before has civilization faced an array of problems as critical as the ones now faced. As forbidding and portentous as it may sound, what is at stake is nothing less than the global survival of human kind. The effects of human impact upon the Earth have been accelerating at a rate unforeseen even a handful of decades ago. Where once nature seemed forever the dominant force on Earth, evidence is rapidly accumulating that human influence over nature has reached a point where natural forces may soon be overwhelmed. Only very recently have the citizens of Earth begun to appreciate the depth of the potential danger of human impact on our planet. The equilibrium of the planet is in jeopardy, as judged by forces as profound as the global climate and the atmospheric protection from the Suns damaging rays. Major changes in the ecological balance of the world are occurring very rapidly, more rapidly in many cases than humanitys ability to assess the dangers.Despite perceived feelings of superiority over nature, humanity remains fully and totally dependent upon the natural world. We need the bounty of nature to survive on this planet. We need the fresh air to breathe, the clean water to drink, the fertile soil to provide our sustenance. Human impact upon these vital substances has reached the point of causing potentially irreversible damage. Scientists around the world, in every country on Earth, are documenting the hazards of ignoring our dependence upon the natural world.There is strong evidence from the worlds scientific community that humanity is very, very close to crossing certain ecological thresholds for the support of life on Earth. The Earths ozone layer, our only protection from the harmful rays of the Sun is being depleted. Massive erosion is causing a rapid loss in the fertile soil of our planet and with it a potentially drastic drop in the ability to produce food for the worlds people. Vast destruction of the worlds forests is contributing to the spread of the worlds deserts, increasing the loss of bio-diversity and hampering the ability of the Earths atmosphere to cleanse itself. The planets vast oceans are losing their animal life at a staggering rate and are fast reaching the limit of their ability to absorb humanitys waste. The land animals and plants of our planet are experiencing a rate of extinction unseen on Earth since the time of the dinosaurs; extinctions brought on not by cataclysmic events of nature but by the impact of a single species: homo-sapiens. The increasing pollution of air, water and land by hazardous and toxic waste is causing wide-spread health problems that are only now beginning to be understood. All of these problems are being intensified by the explosive growth in the sheer numbers of human beings in the last half of the 20th century.For the first time in history, humanity must face the risk of unintentionally destroying the foundation of life on Earth. The global scientific consensus is that if the current levels of environmental deterioration continue, the delicate life-sustaining qualities of this planet will collapse. It is a stark and frightening potential. To prevent such a collapse is an awesome challenge for the global Community.

[Continuing to quote portions of Agenda 21:]
In December of 1989, the General Assembly of the United Nations confronted this daunting task. The urgency of the problems of development and environment prompted the nations of the world to call for an unprecedented meeting - a meeting of all of the nations on Earth - an Earth summit. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development was set for June of 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.The scope of attendance at this historic meeting clearly defines the importance of its task. It was, very simply, the largest gathering of heads of state in the history of life on Earth. On June 13, 1992, nearly 100 world leaders met around a single table in Rio de Janeiro in the largest face-to-face meeting of national leaders in the history of international diplomacy.Agenda 21 is not a static document. It is a plan of action. It is meant to be a hands-on instrument to guide the development of the Earth in a sustainable manner. Recognizing the global nature of the environmental problems that face humanity, it is based on the premise that sustainable development of the Earth is not simply an option: it is a requirement - a requirement increasingly imposed by the limits of nature to absorb the punishment which humanity has inflicted upon it. Agenda 21 is also based on the premise that sustainable development of the Earth is entirely feasible. The transition to a global civilization in balance with nature will be an exceedingly difficult task, but Agenda 21 is the collective global alert that there is no alternative. We must align human civilization with the natural equilibrium of our planet and we must do so very rapidly if we are to prevent an irreversible decline in the quality of life on Earth.The bold goal of Agenda 21 is to halt and reverse the environmental damage to our planet and to promote environmentally sound and sustainable development in all countries on Earth. It is a blueprint for action in all areas relating to the sustainable development of our planet into the 21st century. It calls for specific changes in the activities of all people. It includes concrete measures and incentives to reduce the environmental impact of the industrialized nations, revitalize development in developing nations, eliminate poverty world-wide and stabilize the level of human population. Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world has ever experienced - a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision-making at every level.The successful implementation of the far-ranging actions proposed by Agenda 21 will require active participation by people throughout the world, at the local, national and global levels. There are measures that are directed at all levels of society - from international bodies such as the United Nations and the World Bank to local groups and individuals. There are specific actions which are intended to be undertaken by multinational corporations and entrepreneurs, by financial institutions and individual investors, by high tech companies and indigenous people, by workers and labor unions, by farmers and consumers, by students and schools, by governments and legislators, by scientists, by women, by children - in short, by every person on Earth.The overall levels and patterns of human consumption and production must be compatible with the finite capacities of the Earth. As the human population on Earth increases, there will be ever greater pressure for people throughout the world to attain a higher standard of living. If the model lifestyle for this increasing populace is based on the current excessive consumption levels and inefficient production methods of the industrialized countries, the thresholds of economic and environmental disaster will soon be reached. Sustainable patterns of consumption and efficient methods of production must be developed and encouraged in all societies. One of the most important root causes of the intensifying human impact on our planet is the unprecedented growth in the sheer numbers of human beings in the last 50 years. The worlds population is now growing by nearly 100 million people every year. Population pressures are placing increasing stress on the ecological systems of the planet. All countries must improve their ability to assess the environmental impact of their population growth rates and develop and implement appropriate policies to stabilize populations.

All countries must improve their ability to assess the environmental impact of their population growth rates and develop and implement appropriate policies to stabilize populations.
[Still quoting from Agenda 21, under the heading Controlling Population Growth, we read:]
The spiraling growth of world population fuels the growth of global production and consumption. Rapidly increasing demands for natural resources, employment, education and social services make any attempts to protect natural resources and improve living standards very difficult. There is an immediate need to develop strategies aimed at controlling world population growth. There is an urgent demand to increase awareness among decision-makers of the critical role that population plays in environmental protection and development issues.

There is an urgent demand to increase awareness among decision-makers of the critical role that population plays in environmental protection and development issues.
[Then, under National Population Policies, we find:]
Existing plans for sustainable development have generally recognized that population is a vital factor which influences consumption patterns, production, lifestyles and long-term sustainability. Far more attention, however, must be given to the issue of population in general policy formulation and the design of global development plans. All nations of the world have to improve their capacities to assess the implications of their population patterns. The long term consequences of human population growth must be fully grasped by all nations. They must rapidly formulate and implement appropriate programs to cope with the inevitable increase in population numbers. At the same time, measures must be incorporated to bring about the stabilization of human population. The full consequences of population growth must be understood and taken into account at all levels of decision-making.

[Agenda 21 ends with:]
In the next few years, the basic tenets of Agenda 21 will begin to influence decision-making at every level of society. A deep understanding of the rationale behind the drive for sustainable global development will enable every person to contribute to the success of Agenda 21 programs. For the far-ranging programs of Agenda 21 to be successful, a concern for the environment must begin to be integrated into every human action and every personal decision. What we manufacture What we buy What we wear How we travel What we eat Who we choose as leaders, ...these and a myriad of other daily questions must begin to be answered with a recognition that every single human action has an impact upon both the environment and upon all other people. Humanity has reached the point in its history when it must begin the difficult and demanding task of taking responsibility for each and every one of its actions. The sheer numbers of human beings are now causing our collective actions to have an unprecedented effect upon the planet. As humanity approaches the end of this century, it is poised at a crossroads of unmatched magnitude. The very existence of human life on Earth may well depend upon the direction which is taken in the next few years. Without question, the character and quality of human life on this planet is at stake. The potential for catastrophe is huge. However, the possibilities for success are encouraging. Agenda 21 is itself a monument to the ability of humanity to join together in a global effort to solve the major problems of civilization. We each now have the opportunity and responsibility to help shape the future of life on our fragile planet. The consequences of our collective decisions will be our heritage.

VACCINES
In his book Vaccines: Are They Really Safe And Effective?, Neil Miller (National Vaccine Information Center) writes:
A brief review of the data presented in this book indicates that: Many of the vaccines were not the true cause of a decline in the incidence of the disease. Increased nutritional and sanitary measures probably deserve credit. Some diseases may also have their own evolutionary cycles; the virulent nature of the virgin disease is transformed into a tame illness as members of the population are exposed to it and gain "herd" immunity None of the vaccines can confer genuine immunity. Often the opposite is true; the vaccine increases the chance of contracting the disease. (Published "vaccine efficacy rates" are misleading. They are often evaluated by measuring blood antibody levels - not by comparing infection rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons.) All of the vaccines can produce side-effects. Reactions range from soreness at the injection site to brain damage and death The long-term effects of all vaccines are unknown. Particularly distressing are the implications that vaccines can be devastating to the young childs immature immune system. Studies were presented showing impaired health protection following injections. Lowered physical defenses may be responsible for a new breed of autoimmune diseases. Other studies showed damage to the brain and nervous system following shots - post-vaccinal encephalitis. This, in turn, causes large numbers of children to grow up with physical, mental and emotional disabilities of varying degrees. All of these conditions affect the individual, his or her family, and society as well Several of the vaccines can be especially dangerous. Nevertheless, the Medical-lndustrial Complex continues to maintain its deceptive practice of disregarding vaccine reactions. In fact, medical officials recently suggested that they were justified in administering new and unproven vaccines by claiming it is unethical to withhold them! Meanwhile, creative propaganda on the merits of vaccinations remains a lucrative ploy. For example, the AMA admits that "adult vaccines need a gimmick." CDC physicians suggest a catchy slogan, like "Vaccines are not just kid stuff." Our policy-makers have lobbied for laws against freedom of choice. Their patterns of coercion and denial are notorious among the enlightened members of the population (parents who question vaccines), though sadly their awakenings may have cost them dearly - often the life or health of their own child.

None of the vaccines can confer genuine immunity. Often the opposite is true; the vaccine increases the chance of contracting the disease. (Published "vaccine efficacy rates" are misleading. They are often evaluated by measuring blood antibody levels - not by comparing infection rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons.)
All of the vaccines can produce side-effects. Reactions range from soreness at the injection site to brain damage and death
The long-term effects of all vaccines are unknown. Particularly distressing are the implications that vaccines can be devastating to the young childs immature immune system. Studies were presented showing impaired health protection following injections. Lowered physical defenses may be responsible for a new breed of autoimmune diseases. Other studies showed damage to the brain and nervous system following shots - post-vaccinal encephalitis. This, in turn, causes large numbers of children to grow up with physical, mental and emotional disabilities of varying degrees. All of these conditions affect the individual, his or her family, and society as well
Several of the vaccines can be especially dangerous. Nevertheless, the Medical-lndustrial Complex continues to maintain its deceptive practice of disregarding vaccine reactions. In fact, medical officials recently suggested that they were justified in administering new and unproven vaccines by claiming it is unethical to withhold them! Meanwhile, creative propaganda on the merits of vaccinations remains a lucrative ploy. For example, the AMA admits that "adult vaccines need a gimmick." CDC physicians suggest a catchy slogan, like "Vaccines are not just kid stuff." Our policy-makers have lobbied for laws against freedom of choice. Their patterns of coercion and denial are notorious among the enlightened members of the population (parents who question vaccines), though sadly their awakenings may have cost them dearly - often the life or health of their own child.
MURDER BY INJECTION
In his book Murder By Injection - The Story Of The Medical Conspiracy Against America, Eustace Mullins writes:
One of the few doctors who has dared to speak out against the Medical Monopoly, Dr. Robert S. Mendelsohn, dramatized his stand against Modern Medicine by defining it as a Church which has Four Holy Waters. The first of these, he listed as Vaccination. Dr Mendelsohn termed vaccination "of questionable safety." However, other doctors have been more explicit. It is notable that the Rockefeller interests have fought throughout the nineteenth century to make these Four Holy Waters compulsory throughout the United States, ignoring all the protests and warnings of their dangers. Of these four items, which might well be termed the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, because they too are known to bring death and destruction in their wake, the most pernicious in its long-term effects may well be the practice of immunization. This practice goes directly against the discovery of modern holistic medical experts that the body has a natural immune defense against illness. The Church of Modern Medicine claims that we can only be absolved from the peril of infection by the Holy Water of vaccination, injecting into the system a foreign body of infection, which will then perform a Medical Miracle, and will confer life-long immunity, hence the term, "immunization." The greatest heresy any physician can commit is to voice publicly any doubt of any one of the Four Holy Waters, but the most deeply entrenched in modern medical practice is undoubtedly the numerous vaccination programs. They are also the most consistently profitable operations of the Medical Monopoly. Yet one physician, Dr. Henry R. Bybee, of Norfolk, Virginia, has publicly stated, "My honest opinion is that vaccine is the cause of more disease and suffering than anything I could name. I believe that such diseases as cancer, syphilis, cold sores and many other disease conditions are the direct results of vaccination. Yet, in the state of Virginia, and in many other states, parents are compelled to submit their children to this procedure while the medical profession not only receives its pay for this service, but also makes splendid and prospective patients for the future." From London comes an alarming observation from a practitioner of excellent reputation and long experience. Dr. Herbert Snow, senior surgeon at the Cancer Hospital of London, voiced his concern, "in recent years many men and women in the prime of life have dropped dead suddenly, often after attending a feast or a banquet. I am convinced that some eighty percent of these deaths are caused by the inoculation or vaccination they have undergone. They are well known to cause grave and permanent disease of the heart. The coroner always hushes it up as "natural causes". You cannot find any such warning in any medical textbook or popular book on health. In fact, this writer was able to locate it in a small volume buried deep in the stacks in the Library of Congress. Yet such an ominous observation from an established medical practitioner should be as widely circulated as possible, if only to be attacked by those who can refute its premise. At least it cannot be attacked by the Establishment as quackery, because Dr. Snow is not attempting to sell some substitute for vaccination, but merely warning of its dangers.Another practitioner, Dr. W.B. Clarke of Indiana, finds that "Cancer was practically unknown until compulsory vaccination with cowpox vaccine began to be introduced. I have had to deal with at least two hundred cases of cancer, and I never saw a case of cancer in an unvaccinated person." At last, we have the breakthrough for which the American Cancer Society has been searching, at such great expense, and for so many years. Dr. Clarke has never seen a case of cancer in an unvaccinated person. Is not this a lead which should be explored?In the land where freedom rings, or is supposed to ring, it is even more surprising to find that every citizen is compelled to submit to a compulsory vaccination ritual. Here again, we are speaking of a civilization which is now being visited by two plagues, the plague of cancer and the plague of AIDS, yet compulsory vaccination offers no protection against the plagues which threaten us. It is good-bye whooping cough, good-bye diphtheria and hello AIDS. The Medical Monopoly is searching desperately for some type of "immunization" against these plagues, and no doubt will eventually come up with some type of "vaccine" which will be more dreadful than the disease. From the outset, our most distinguished medical experts have proudly informed us that AIDS is incurable, which is hardly the approach we expect from those who demand that we accept their infallibility in all things to do with medicine.Another well known medical practitioner, Dr. J.M. Peebles of San Francisco, has written a book on vaccine, in which he says, "The vaccination practice, pushed to the front on all occasions by the medical profession through political connivance made compulsory by the state, has not only become the chief menace and the greatest danger to the health of the rising generation, but likewise the crowning outrage upon the personal liberties of the American citizen; compulsory vaccination, poisoning the crimson currents of the human system with brute-extracted lymph under the strange infatuation that it would prevent smallpox, was one of the darkest blots that disfigured the last century." Dr. Peebles refers to the fact that cowpox vaccine was one of the more peculiar "inventions or discoveries of the Age of Enlightenment." However, as I have pointed out in The Curse Of Canaan, the 'Age of Enlightenment' was merely the latest program of the Cult of Baal and its rituals of child sacrifice, which, in one guise or another, has now been with us for some five thousand years. Because of this goal, the Medical Monopoly is also known as "The Society for Crippling Children."Perhaps the most telling comment of Dr. Peebles criticism is his reference to "brute-extracted lymph." Could there be some connection between the injection of this substance and the spread of a hitherto unknown form of cancer, cancer of the lymph glands? This type of cancer is not only one of the most commonly encountered versions of this disease; it is also one of the most difficult to treat, because it rapidly spreads throughout the entire system. A diagnosis of cancer of the lymph glands now means a virtual death sentence. In an article in Science, March 4, 1977, Jonas and Darrell Salk warn that, "Live virus vaccines against influenza or poliomyelitis may in each instance produce the disease it intended to prevent ... the live virus against measles and mumps may produce such side effects as encephalitis (brain damage)." If vaccines present such a clear and present danger in children who are forced to submit to them, we must examine the forces which demand that they submit. In the United States, vaccines are actively and incessantly promoted as the solution for all infectious diseases by such government agencies as the Centers for Disease Control in Georgia, by HEW, USPHS, FDA, AMA and WHO. It is of more than passing interest that the federal agencies should be such passionate supporters of compulsory use of vaccines, and that they also should go through the "revolving door" to the big drug firms whose products they have so assiduously promoted, throughout their years of service to the public. It is these federal agents who have drafted the procedures which forced the states to enact compulsory vaccination legislation which had been drafted by the attorneys for the Medical Monopoly, to become "the law of the land." Medical historians have finally come to the reluctant conclusion that the great flu "epidemic" of 1918 was solely attributable to the widespread use of vaccines. It was the first war in which vaccination was compulsory for all servicemen. The Boston Herald reported that forty-seven soldiers had been killed by vaccination in one month. As a result, the military hospitals were filled, not with wounded combat casualties, but with casualties of the vaccine. The epidemic was called "the Spanish Influenza," a deliberately misleading appellation, which was intended to conceal its origin. This flu epidemic claimed twenty million victims; those who survived it were the ones who had refused the vaccine. In recent years, annual recurring epidemics of flu recalled "the Russian Flu." For some reason, the Russians never protest, perhaps because the Rockefellers make regular trips to Moscow to lay down the party line.The perils of vaccination were already known. Plain Talk magazine notes that, "during the Franco-Prussian War, every German soldier was vaccinated. The result was that 53,288 otherwise healthy men developed smallpox. The death rate was high." In what is now known as "the Great Swine Flu Massacre," the President of the United States, Gerald Ford, was enlisted to persuade the public to undergo a national vaccination campaign. The moving force behind the scheme was a $135 million windfall profit for the major drug manufacturers. They had a "swine flu" vaccine which suspicious pig raisers had refused to touch, fearful it might wipe out their crop. The manufacturers had only tried to get $80 million from the swine breeders; balked in this sale, they turned to the other market, humans. The impetus for the national swine flu vaccine came directly from the Disease Control Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Perhaps coincidentally, Jimmy Carter, a member of the Trilateral Commission, was then planning his presidential campaign in Georgia. The incumbent President, Gerald Ford, had all the advantages of a massive bureaucracy to aid him in his election campaign, while the ineffectual and little known Jimmy Carter offered no serious threat to the election. Suddenly, out of Atlanta, came the Centers for Disease Control plan for a national immunization campaign against "swine flu." The fact that there was not a single known case of this flu in the United States did not deter the Medical Monopoly from their scheme. The swine breeders had been shocked by the demonstrations of the vaccine on a few pigs, which had collapsed and died. One can imagine the anxious conferences in the headquarters of the great drug firms, until one bright young man remarked, "Well, if the swine breeders wont inject it into their animals, our only other market is to inject it into people." The Ford-sponsored swine flu campaign almost died an early death, when a conscientious public servant, Dr. Anthony Morris, formerly of HEW and then active as director of the Virus Bureau of the Food and Drug Administration, declared that there could be no authentic swine flu vaccine, because there had never been any cases of swine flu on which they could test it. Dr. Morris then went public with his statement that "at no point were the swine flu vaccines effective." He was promptly fired, but the damage had been done. The damage control consisted of that great humanitarian, Walter Cronkite, and the President of the United States, combining their forces to come to the rescue of the Medical Monopoly. Walter Cronkite had President Ford appear on his news program to urge the American people to submit to the inoculation with the swine flu vaccine. CBS then or later could never find any reason to air any analysis or scientific critique of the swine flu vaccine, which was identified as containing many toxic poisons, including alien vital protein particles, formaldehyde, theimorosal (a derivative of poisonous mercury), polysorbate and some eighty other substances. Meanwhile, back at the virus laboratories, after Dr. Anthony Morris has been summarily fired, a special team of workers was rushed in to clean out the four rooms in which he had conducted his scientific tests. The laboratory was filled with animals whose records verified his claims, representing some three years of constant research. All of the animals were immediately destroyed, and Morris records were burned. They did not go so far as to sow salt throughout the area, because they believed their job was done.On April 15, 1976, Congress passed Public Law 94-266, which provided $135 million of taxpayers funds to pay for a national swine flu inoculation campaign. HEW was to distribute the vaccine to state and local health agencies on a national basis for inoculation, at no charge. Insurance agencies then went public with their warning that they would not insure drug firms against possible studies from the results of swine flu inoculation, because no studies had been carried out which could predict its effects. It was to foil the insurance companies that CBS had Gerald Ford make his impassioned appeal to 215,000,000 Americans to save themselves while there was still time, and to rush down to the friendly local health department and get the swine flu vaccination, at absolutely no charge. This may have been CBS finest hour in its distinguished career of "public service."Hardly had the swine flu campaign been completed than the reports of the casualties began to pour in. Within a few months, claims totaling $1.3 billion had been filed by victims who had suffered paralysis from the swine flu vaccine. The medical authorities proved equal to the challenge; they leaped to the defense of the Medical Monopoly by labeling the new epidemic, "Guillain-Barre Syndrome." There have since been increasing speculations that the ensuing epidemic of AIDS which began shortly after Gerald Fords public assurances, were merely a viral variation of the swine flu vaccine. And what of the perpetrator of the Great Swine Flu Massacre, President Gerald Ford? As the logical person to blame for the catastrophe, Ford had to endure a torrent of public criticism, which quite naturally resulted in his defeat for election (he had previously been appointed when the agents of the international drug operations had ushered Richard Nixon out of office). The unknown Jimmy Carter, familiar only to the super-secret fellow members of the Trilateral Commission, was swept into office by the outpouring of rage against Gerald Ford. Carter proved to be almost as serious a national disaster as the swine flu epidemic, while Gerald Ford was retired from politics to life. Not only did he lose the election, he was also sentenced to spend his remaining years trudging wearily up and down the hot sandy stretches of the Palm Springs Golf course. At the annual ACS Science Writers Seminar, Dr. Robert W. Simpson, of Rutgers University, warned that, "immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form pro-viruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body ... they can then become activated as a variety of diseases including lupus, cancer, rheumatism and arthritis." This was a remarkable verification of the earlier warning delivered by Dr. Herbert Snow of London more than fifty years earlier. He had observed that the long-term effects of the vaccine, lodging in the heart or other parts of the body, would eventually result in fatal damage to the heart. The vaccine becomes a time bomb in the system, festering as what are known as "slow viruses", which may take ten to thirty years to become virulent. When that time arrives, the victim is felled by a fatal onslaught, often with no prior warning, whether it is a heart attack or some other disease.Herbert M. Shelton wrote in 1938 in his book, Exploitation Of Human Suffering that, "Vaccine is pus - either septic or inert - if inert it will not take - if septic it produces infection." This explains why some children have to go back and receive a second inoculation, because the first one did not "take" - it was not sufficiently poisonous, and did not infect the body. Shelton says that the inoculations cause sleeping sickness, infantile paralysis, haemophlagia or tetanus. The Surgeon General of the United States, Leonard Scheele, pointed out to the annual AMA convention in 1955 that, "No batch of vaccine can be proven safe before it is given to children." James R. Shannon of the National Institute of Health declared that, "The only safe vaccine is a vaccine that is never used." With the advent of Dr. Jonas Salks polio vaccine in the 1950s American parents were assured that the problem had been solved, and that their children were now safe. The ensuing suits against the drug manufacturers received little publicity. David v. Wyeth Labs, a suit involving Type 3 Sabin Polio Vaccine, was judged in favor of the plaintiff, David. A suit against Lederle Lab involving Orimune Vaccine was settled in 1962 for $10,000. In two cases involving Parke-Davis Quadrigen, the product was found to be defective. In 1962, Parke-Davis halted all production of Quadrigen. The medical loner, Dr. William Koch, declared that, "The injection of any serum, vaccine, or even penicillin has shown a very marked increase in the incidence of polio, at least by 400%." The Centers for Disease Control stayed out of sight for some time after the Great Swine Flu Massacre, only to emerge more stridently than ever with a new national scare program on the dangers of another plague, which was named "Legionnaires Disease" after an outbreak at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia.
One of the few doctors who has dared to speak out against the Medical Monopoly, Dr. Robert S. Mendelsohn, dramatized his stand against Modern Medicine by defining it as a Church which has Four Holy Waters.

SWINE VIRUS
****ALERT****In a headline from the Dec. 18, 1995 edition of the San Francisco Examiner we read the following AP story:
Swine Viruses Pose Ongoing Threat Of Global Flu Epidemic Pig and human bugs joining DNA may spawn new strain WASHINGTON It may start with a pig on a remote farm in Asia. A human influenza virus and a swine virus somehow lodge near each other in the throat of a porker. The two viruses exchange DNA, forming a unique genetic combination. Suddenly a brand new form of influenza is born.With a simple snort by the pig, the new flu is airborne and introduced into the world. Inhaled by the farmer, it quickly reproduces by the millions and is transported to town, passed around to other humans and then hitches a ride to the city in the bronchial passages of a traveler.Within days, thousands of humans are hacking, coughing and feverish from the new virus. The bug continues to spread, to train stations, airports and ships. In only a few weeks, a virus created by chance in that remote pig pen is felling people on six continents around the world.That, many experts say, is how the next pandemic - or worldwide epidemic - of killer flu could happen. Time after time, going back hundreds of years, new forms of the flu bug have broken loose and killed millions. Now, say the experts, the world may be overdue for that to happen yet again.In an age of antibiotics and vaccines, most people regard flu as dangerous only to the elderly, the very young and those already ill. But, to experts, it lurks as a constant threat to all. "Flu in the last decade has assumed something of a secondary status," said Dr. John LaMentague of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "But we who have dealt with the infection recognize its power." The flu virus, he said, "is constantly changing and dynamic and very resourceful."
Swine Viruses Pose Ongoing Threat Of Global Flu Epidemic Pig and human bugs joining DNA may spawn new strain WASHINGTON
It may start with a pig on a remote farm in Asia. A human influenza virus and a swine virus somehow lodge near each other in the throat of a porker. The two viruses exchange DNA, forming a unique genetic combination. Suddenly a brand new form of influenza is born.With a simple snort by the pig, the new flu is airborne and introduced into the world. Inhaled by the farmer, it quickly reproduces by the millions and is transported to town, passed around to other humans and then hitches a ride to the city in the bronchial passages of a traveler.Within days, thousands of humans are hacking, coughing and feverish from the new virus. The bug continues to spread, to train stations, airports and ships. In only a few weeks, a virus created by chance in that remote pig pen is felling people on six continents around the world.That, many experts say, is how the next pandemic - or worldwide epidemic - of killer flu could happen.

MORE ON VIRUSES
In Dr. Eva Sneads Some Call It AIDS - I Call It Murder, we read [quoting portions from several chapters:]
Vaccines, Friend or Foe? Under the title of "Bad Vaccines?", a journal as conservative as Newsweek expounds on the subject of vaccine contamination with retrovital microbes. "Could any of the worlds stock of vaccine be contaminated by animal retroviruses similar to AIDS?", it asks. It tells of Jeremy Rifkins request that the World Health Organization test its smallpox vaccines for such contaminants.In the case of Rifkins concern about the smallpox vaccination, the main concern was to find possible "BIV" closely related to the human AIDS virus - and people at high risk of exposure, such as meatpackers, for BIV antibodies.Type "A" blood substance and "some other proteins" are unexpected materials present in cultures used to manufacture vaccinesHumans have diverse blood groups, the most well known are "A", "B" and "0". Blood groups determine compatibility or lack thereof, in blood transfusions. Animal blood and tissues contain a substance that is very similar to blood substance "A".Substances with a proteic structure, promote the production of antibodies when injected. Some aspects of this subject were discussed at the 1967 NCI meeting by Dr. J.P. Fox, who was intrigued about certain myxoviruses which had surface antigens on them. He wondered if they provoked antibody responses in recipients. "The crude influenza vaccines we have been using in the past do contain group "A" blood substance ... This substance also is found in chick embryo. So either the influenza virus has group "A" substance in it ... or else the vaccine carries some of the chick embryo with it.""And I pointed out there is a lot of chick embryo protein in finished influenza vaccine, and the group A substance probably comes from the chick embryo tissues; this can be eliminated as a significant problem IF the influenza virus is grown in a cleaner substrate or is purified. Certainly, the myxoviruses do carry over some of the host protein." Again, the total lack of control of procedure, and scientific accuracy is appalling. I think that a butcher places more emphasis in properly dissecting a side of beef, than a cell culture lab in supervising the accuracy of such a dangerous undertaking. Adenovirus and SV-40, A Dangerous Combination A favorite cop-out used by virologists and other "scientists" who wish to conceal their closet-skeletons, is that inter-species infection with viruses is difficult. They usually refer to single-virus tests, not the use of viral systems. For instance, although human adenoviruses infect monkey kidneys rather poorly, if SV-40 is added, the human adenovirus infection becomes strong and lytic (destructive) of the cells. According to Fox and Baum, "The ability of SV-40 genetic material to increase the yield of adenovirus by 100 or 1,000 fold has been termed enhancement." On the other hand, stocks E46 and SP2 of a certain strain of adenovirus (type 7) can induce the information of papovavirus SV40 tumor antigen (T antigen) in African Green Monkey Kidney cells (GMK). What actually happens is that a new virus may form when an adenovirus acquires new genetic material from the 8V-40 virus. These viral combinations were called hybrids in 1965, whereas today they are referred to as recombinants. Since we have established this equivalence, we must become aware, at this moment, that genetic engineering was alive and well long before anyone had used that term, and in total absence of any containment precautions or regulations. The impact this may have had on the environment is probably just manifesting with the plagues of the eighties and nineties.Since SV-40 has such an enhancing effect on adenovirus, and hybrids (combinations, or what today we would call recombinants) of SV-40 and adenovirus are found in monkey kidneys used in the process of vaccine manufacturing, many virologists have researched other such SF-40 and other virus combinations. They found several, including measles + SV-40, foamy virus + SV-40 reovirus + SV-40. SV-40 is like good rum, a great mixer!

[And last, but certainly not least, from Dr. Snead:]
The African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) Connection Some "AIDS" patients harbor swine fever viruses similar to those found in certain specialized research centers.A scientist who worked in Uganda in 1985, reported to Senator Ted Kennedy about a civil war in that country, which was accompanied by an epidemic of African Swine Fever Virus. At the same time, AIDS cases were being reported in alarming numbers. The researcher noticed that swine were roaming freely in peoples yards. This information was released in the New York Native of Sept. 30, 1985. These facts were not particularly appreciated by the medical establishment, and those who dared pursue this line of thinking were chided in more than one way.Dr. C.L.V. Martins, who researched phenomena occurring in swine, studied the behavior of one of the cellular elements that protects the body: the macrophage. "Loss of macrophage function during infection may be important in determining resistance or susceptibility of a host." In all the studies performed by this author, the macrophages not only had reduced function, but they also often kept the virus in a latent state. These studies were done on swine, not humans. Since one must be exposed to raw, living pig tissue and fluids to acquire these viruses, most people assume they could not be infected with these organisms in the daily course of their lives. But the truth lies elsewhere. With the usual hypocrisy so characteristic of bureaucracies, humans are, on the one hand, frequently warned of the dangers inherent to the improper cooking of pork, and, on the other, fed raw swine-juice ever since their birth, by direct command of health authorities. Impossible? All vaccines are treated with trypsin, raw stomach extracts of swine. Insulin and other biologicals of porcine origin are other sources. Those who dared to suggest that AIDS could have some connection with swine flu were violently chided by the powers of the "health and illness monopoly". The violent reaction of the establishment against those who first found porcine viruses in AIDS patients and then informed the public is highly suspicious and may suggest that some cover-up is under way.

BLACK PLAGUE NEEDED
In a newspaper clipping with the above headline, source unknown, which reads "excerpted from Dr. Aurelio Peccei of the Club of Romes News Watch magazine from Jan. 2, 1995," we see the following,
Sir Julian Huxley said, "Overpopulation is, in my opinion, the most serious threat to the whole future of our species." The project, called MK-NAOMI, was carried out at Fort Detrick, Maryland. AIDS was made to reduce the population. Specifically targeted were the black, Hispanic, and homosexual populations.The incurable disease AIDS has been spread with the willful aid of international agencies whose policies call for a drastic reduction of the population, using any means necessary. Already, medical experts say as many as 30 million people in Africa have been infected with the AIDS virus.WHO, World Health Organization, was established in 1948 with the help of Dr. John Rawlings Rees, the psychological warfare expert whose notorious Tavistock Institute and Clinic in London used brainwashing techniques as a means to carry out racial policies of genocide.Since its inception, the WHO membership and policies have overlapped those of the WFMH and UNESCO, established in 1946 by British racialist Julian Huxley, as a vehicle for wiping out 3rd World populations with a new "Dark Ages" of famine and pestilence. Each of the organizations named were set up as a project of the British "liberal" networks of Bertrand Russell and company whose explicit, stated policies of population control included Russells published call for the "creation of a Black Death every 50 years" to curb the black and yellow population.The Club of Romes raison dêtre is to wipe out half the human race in this century.Several Top Secret recommendations were made by Dr. Aurelio Peccei of the Club of Rome. He advocated that a plague be introduced that would have the same effect as the famous Black Death of history. The chief recommendation was to develop a microbe which would attack the auto-immune system and thus render the development of a vaccine impossible.

PAST PLAGUES
In Michael Tobias book World War Ill - Population And The Biosphere At The End Of The Millennium, he writes:
Until recently, human beings were very much a part of this biological system of checks and balances, which seem to hold firm for all organisms. Four primary inclemencies kept Homo Sapiens in relative population calm: high infant mortality, war, famine, and disease, all contributing to a meager life expectancy. The Black Plague (Pasteurella pestis) was transmitted from the Tibetan Silk Route to a harbor at Sicily in 1347. Rodents account for 50 percent of all mammals, and it was the friendly rat, carrier of the rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis), that caused such demolition. At least 30 percent of the human population died out - 50 percent between Iceland and India. Boom and bust need operate according to food scarcities and resulting famine. Disease, acting upon a host, or dense network of hosts, plays a similar role in the maintenance of populations. Not unlike the moths and the lemmings, Europeans witnessed a spectacular revival of their populations within a century of the Plague, exceeding their pre-Plague numbers.A climatic change in eighteenth century Scandinavia allegedly compelled the Norwegian gray rat (which does not carry the plague) to find passage into western Europe, where it successfully ousted the indigenous flea-carrying black rat, thus eliminating the most incisive threat to human population. "More than any single carrier, it is human encroachment that ultimately precipitates the emergence of killer viruses," writes Stephen S. Morse. In Japan (Japanese encephalitis), Argentina (hemorrhagic fever), U.S. (Seoul virus in Baltimore), Panama (Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis), and in nearly every other country, the connection between increasing ecological destruction and the sudden exposure of humans to long isolated or dormant bacteria, protozoans, fungi and viruses, has been identified. Never before has there been such an avid exchange of "information" between large species (Homo Sapiens) and microbes. Of the more than 100 zoonoses (animal infections transmittable to humans) and over 520 known arthropod-born "arboviruses", at least 100 have been shown to cause diseases in people. Some are among the deadliest diseases every encountered. In 1976 in Zaire and Sudan, as many as 90 percent of those infected with Ebola virus died horribly within weeks. The most recent incident of plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, occurred in India at the turn of the twentieth century and killed more than 10 million people. At the same time, a small outbreak among Chinese occurred in San Francisco. Another outbreak of the magnitude of that in India has been postulated for the United States. In 1918 influenza A pandemic claimed 20 million lives worldwide in less than a year. It is believed to have originated in the United States, went to France, then returned to the U.S. where it spread rapidly from New York to California. Since then there have been serious global influenza outbreaks on at least five occasions.

While I was working on this portion of the depopulation story, Hatonn wrote "Disaster In Flus Clothing". Hatonns timely warning further emphasizes the immediate importance of this subject currently at hand.
It is for this reason that I have chosen to somewhat expand Part V to include many current alarming headlines on the very subject of viruses and current disease.
AND NOW A LOOK AT SOME CURRENT HEADLINES
Global diseases close to "crisis", blood probe told In a story from the Dec. 2, 1995 edition of The Toronto Star, written by Nick Pron, we read: The spread of infectious diseases worldwide is reaching "crisis" levels, and no country is immune to the problem, a federal Commission was told yesterday. Canadians have to "stop thinking of ourselves in terms of isolation from the rest of the world" and get "tuned in to whats happening around the planet," Dr. Kevin Kain told the inquiry conducted by Mr. Justice Horace Krever, who is probing the safety of Canadas blood system. Officials Warn of a Virus Deadly to Children In the Dec. 8, 1995 edition of the New York Times, we read: A winter respiratory virus that kills about 4,500 children a year in the United States has appeared once again, with cases already being reported across the country, federal health officials said today. The officials of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention here, said respiratory syncytial virus, or R.S.V., caused 90,000 infants and young children to be hospitalized each year with lower respiratory tract disease.Dr. Tom Torok, a medical epidemiologist at the agencys National Center for Infectious Disease, said the virus could also cause serious respiratory disease in the elderly and in people with weakened immune systems. "R.S.V. is under-appreciated as a cause of respiratory disease in adults," he said. "The actual magnitude has not been well studied." During the last month, the virus has been found in all 44 states that report the results of tests for it. Activity usually begins in early November, peaks between late January and mid-February and continues until April or early May.Dr. Torok said the virus was most difficult to distinguish from influenza when it occurred in adults. "We dont really know whether or not there are good clinical indicators of R.S.V. versus influenza," he said.Researchers are working on vaccines to protect against the respiratory virus and are studying the effect of giving infants a serum laden with antibodies against it. 13,000 a day infected by HIV One out of five carriers of deadly virus lives in southeast Asia In the Dec. 1, 1995 edition of the Calgary Herald we read: About 13,000 people a day worldwide are infected by the virus that causes AIDS, and southeast Asia is fast becoming a main casualty zone for the disease, a leading U.S. expert said Thursday. Jonathan Mann, director of the Global AIDS Policy Coalition, an independent international research group based at the Harvard School of Public Health, said one out of five carriers of HIV lives in southeast Asia. "We estimate that during 1995, about 4.7 million people became newly infected with HIV around the world."If it continues to go as it is, it may well be in the 70-80 million range by the year 2000." Plagues scourge Latin America as experts despair In an article from the Nov. 29, 1995 edition of The Montreal Gazette, written by Laurie Goering we read: Manaus Brazil - It starts with a fever, like a hundred less deadly plagues. Then comes a growing weakness. The skin turns yellow. In the abdomen, internal bleeding begins. Soon blood pours from the body, through the eyes and in the endless black vomit. In nine out of ten cases, the liver dissolves and the victim dies.lts not Ebola. Its Labrea black fever, just one of a half dozen deadly and little understood viral diseases, emerging from the rain forest of Latin America. "People all the time are going to the jungle and coming back with strange fevers no one knows about" said Bedsy Dutary Thatcher, a malaria specialist at Brazils National Institute for Amazon Research in Manaus. "If we started looking for them we could isolate a new variety every week." Perhaps never has the battle against disease looked so bleak as it does right now in Latin America and in much of the Third World. Across the planet, new diseases are appearing at a frightening pace, researchers say. Even more disturbing: old scourges once thought relegated to history are making a comeback, particularly in Latin America.Tuberculosis, thought conquered after the introduction of new drugs in the 1940s, has roared back and is spreading out of control. Malaria, one of the worlds oldest plagues, also is making a comeback. Latin America reported more than a million new cases last year, half of them in Brazil.In Nicaragua and Honduras, a mystery illness characterized by chills, fever and severe bleeding in the lungs has been tentatively identified as leptospirosis, an animal disease contracted through contact with animal waste. The outbreak has killed 16 people and sickened more than 2,000 in the two countries over the last two months. A similar outbreak in Brazil killed more than 40 people in February.In Colombia, what appears to have been an outbreak of mosquito-borne equine encephalitis killed at least 26 people and drove 13,000 others to seek treatment in September.In Mexico and across much of Latin America dengue fever, characterized by high fever and intense body pain, has struck nearly 200,000 people this year and is threatening to move into the United States. A deadly variant of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever, has stricken another 3,500 people.In Guyana, an unidentified illness characterized by high fever, vomiting and convulsions killed five toddlers and threatened eight others at an eastern Guyana hospital this month. "Communicable diseases are resurging," said Dan Epstein, a spokesman for the Pan American Health Organization, based in Washington, D.C. "Weve had a whole series of hemorrhagic fevers, including dengue, and the problems continue to increase." Deadly Virus Second outbreak of Ebola checked In a newspaper clipping faxed to us this week, we read the following AP story: Experts trying to contain an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia are investigating reports of deaths in a second location, a World Health Organization spokesman said. Ebola Tamed - for NowIn the Jan. 1996 edition of Discover appears an article of the above title. This article opens with, "Last Springs plague movie, Outbreak, had to compete with a real life cliff-hanger: an appearance, in Zaire, of the dreaded Ebola virus." Contained within this article on Ebola, is another article written by Sarah Richardson titled "Breakbone Outbreak", which opens with: "While Zaires deadly Ebola virus was flaring up briefly, a far more widespread vital scourge was threatening the Americas. In 1995 dengue fever, nicknamed breakbone fever for the terrible joint pain it causes, reached epidemic proportions in Latin America and Caribbean countries, sickening more than 140,000 and killing 38." Have you noticed that CNN, within the last two or three months, has run several half-hour specials on Ebola Zaire? Coincidence? They said in one program that it isnt a question of if, it is a question of when Ebola will strike in the United States. Also keep in mind what Peter Kawaja has said about the Gulf War Illness - being a form of Ebola Reston, a slow acting form of Ebola. More on that later.

About 13,000 people a day worldwide are infected by the virus that causes AIDS, and southeast Asia is fast becoming a main casualty zone for the disease, a leading U.S. expert said Thursday. Jonathan Mann, director of the Global AIDS Policy Coalition, an independent international research group based at the Harvard School of Public Health, said one out of five carriers of HIV lives in southeast Asia. "We estimate that during 1995, about 4.7 million people became newly infected with HIV around the world."If it continues to go as it is, it may well be in the 70-80 million range by the year 2000."

Plagues scourge Latin America as experts despair In an article from the Nov. 29, 1995 edition of The Montreal Gazette, written by Laurie Goering we read:
Manaus Brazil - It starts with a fever, like a hundred less deadly plagues. Then comes a growing weakness. The skin turns yellow. In the abdomen, internal bleeding begins. Soon blood pours from the body, through the eyes and in the endless black vomit. In nine out of ten cases, the liver dissolves and the victim dies.lts not Ebola. Its Labrea black fever, just one of a half dozen deadly and little understood viral diseases, emerging from the rain forest of Latin America. "People all the time are going to the jungle and coming back with strange fevers no one knows about" said Bedsy Dutary Thatcher, a malaria specialist at Brazils National Institute for Amazon Research in Manaus. "If we started looking for them we could isolate a new variety every week." Perhaps never has the battle against disease looked so bleak as it does right now in Latin America and in much of the Third World. Across the planet, new diseases are appearing at a frightening pace, researchers say. Even more disturbing: old scourges once thought relegated to history are making a comeback, particularly in Latin America.Tuberculosis, thought conquered after the introduction of new drugs in the 1940s, has roared back and is spreading out of control. Malaria, one of the worlds oldest plagues, also is making a comeback. Latin America reported more than a million new cases last year, half of them in Brazil.In Nicaragua and Honduras, a mystery illness characterized by chills, fever and severe bleeding in the lungs has been tentatively identified as leptospirosis, an animal disease contracted through contact with animal waste. The outbreak has killed 16 people and sickened more than 2,000 in the two countries over the last two months. A similar outbreak in Brazil killed more than 40 people in February.In Colombia, what appears to have been an outbreak of mosquito-borne equine encephalitis killed at least 26 people and drove 13,000 others to seek treatment in September.In Mexico and across much of Latin America dengue fever, characterized by high fever and intense body pain, has struck nearly 200,000 people this year and is threatening to move into the United States. A deadly variant of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever, has stricken another 3,500 people.In Guyana, an unidentified illness characterized by high fever, vomiting and convulsions killed five toddlers and threatened eight others at an eastern Guyana hospital this month. "Communicable diseases are resurging," said Dan Epstein, a spokesman for the Pan American Health Organization, based in Washington, D.C. "Weve had a whole series of hemorrhagic fevers, including dengue, and the problems continue to increase."

Deadly Virus Second outbreak of Ebola checked
In a newspaper clipping faxed to us this week, we read the following AP story:
Experts trying to contain an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia are investigating reports of deaths in a second location, a World Health Organization spokesman said.
Ebola Tamed - for NowIn the Jan. 1996 edition of Discover appears an article of the above title. This article opens with,
"Last Springs plague movie, Outbreak, had to compete with a real life cliff-hanger: an appearance, in Zaire, of the dreaded Ebola virus."
Contained within this article on Ebola, is another article written by Sarah Richardson titled "Breakbone Outbreak", which opens with:
"While Zaires deadly Ebola virus was flaring up briefly, a far more widespread vital scourge was threatening the Americas. In 1995 dengue fever, nicknamed breakbone fever for the terrible joint pain it causes, reached epidemic proportions in Latin America and Caribbean countries, sickening more than 140,000 and killing 38."
Have you noticed that CNN, within the last two or three months, has run several half-hour specials on Ebola Zaire? Coincidence?
They said in one program that it isnt a question of if, it is a question of when Ebola will strike in the United States. Also keep in mind what Peter Kawaja has said about the Gulf War Illness - being a form of Ebola Reston, a slow acting form of Ebola.
More on that later.
HEPATITIS
In a one-page ad appearing in the Jan. 11, 1996 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, we read:
"Five million Americans have hepatitis. Do you?"
In another headline from the Nov. 29, 1995 edition of The Montreal Gazette:
Aussies exult as deadly virus hits rabbits Broken Hill, Australia - It sounds like a script for a horror film: a deadly virus escapes from a biohazard lab. Corpses litter the landscape as a plague spreads across a continent.But rather than flee in terror, Australians are cheering a virus that is wiping out rabbits across the outback. The real plague, people say, is the rabbit population. "Its history, and well look back on this month and say what a wonderful thing it was," said sheep-rancher David Lord.
