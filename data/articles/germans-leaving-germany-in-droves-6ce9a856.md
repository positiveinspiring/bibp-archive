# Germans Leaving Germany 'In Droves'

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalization_eu228.htm

A growing number of Germans are
abandoning neighborhoods in which they have lived all their
lives, and others are leaving Germany for good, as mass
immigration transforms parts of the country beyond recognition.
Data from the German statistics
agency, Destatis,
shows that 138,000 Germans left Germany in 2015.
More are
expected to emigrate in 2016. In a story on brain drain titled,
"German talent is leaving the country in droves," Die Welt
reported that more than 1.5 million Germans, many of them
highly educated, left Germany during the past decade.
The statistics do not give a reason
why Germans are emigrating, but anecdotal evidence indicates
that many are waking up to the true cost - financial, social and
cultural - of Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to allow more
than one million mostly Muslim migrants to enter the country in
2015.
At least 300,000 more migrants are expected to arrive in
Germany in 2016,
according to Frank-Jürgen Weise, the head of the country's
migration office, BAMF.
Mass migration has - among many
other problems - contributed to a growing sense of insecurity in
Germany, which is facing a spike in migrant crime, including an
epidemic of rapes and sexual assaults. Mass migration is
also accelerating the Islamization of Germany.
Many Germans appear to be losing
hope about the future direction of their country.
At the height of the migrant crisis
in October 2015, some 800 citizens gathered at a town hall
meeting in Kassel/Lohfelden to protest a unilateral decision by
the local government to set up migrant shelters in the city.
The President of Kassel, Walter Lübcke,
responded by telling those who disagree with the
government's open-door immigration policy that they are,
"free to leave Germany at any
time."
This attitude was echoed in an
audacious essay published in October 2016 by the newspaper
Der Freitag, (also published by Huffington Post Deutschland,
which subsequently deleted the post).
In the article, an 18-year-old
Syrian migrant named Aras Bacho called on Germans who are angry
about the migrant crisis to leave Germany.
He
wrote:
"We refugees... are fed up with
the angry citizens (Wutbürger).
They insult and
agitate like crazy... There are always these incitements by
unemployed racists (Wutbürgern), who spend all their
time on the Internet and wait until an article about
refugees appears on the Internet. Then it starts with
shameless comments...
"Hello, you unemployed angry
citizens (Wutbürger) on the Internet. How educated
are you? How long will you continue to distort the truth? Do
you not know that you are spreading lies every day? What
would you have done if you were in their shoes? Well, you
would have run away!
"We refugees... do not want to
live in the same country with you. You can, and I think you
should, leave Germany. And please take Saxony and the
Alternative for Germany (AfD) with you.
"Germany does not fit you, why
do you live here? Why do you not go to another country? If
this is your country, dear angry citizens (Wutbürger),
then behave normal. Otherwise you can simply flee from
Germany and look for a new home.
Go to America to Donald Trump,
he will love you very much. We are sick of you!"
In May 2016, the newsmagazine,
Focus,
reported that Germans have been moving to Hungary.
A real estate agent in a town near
Lake Balaton, a popular tourist destination in western Hungary,
said that 80% of the Germans relocating there cite
the migration
crisis as the main reason for their desire to leave Germany.
An anonymous German citizen who
emigrated from Germany recently wrote an "Open Letter to the
German Government."
The document, which was published on
the website Politically Incorrect,
states:
"A few months ago I emigrated
from Germany.
My decision was not for economic
gain but primarily because of my dissatisfaction with the
current political and social conditions in my homeland.
In
other words, I think that I and especially my offspring may
lead a better life somewhere else. 'Better' for me in this
context is primarily a life of freedom, self-determination
and decent wages with respect to taxation.
"I do not, however, want to
close the door behind me quietly and just go.
I would hereby like to explain
in a constructive way why I decided to leave Germany.
-
"I believe that Islam
does not belong to Germany. I regard it as a foreign
entity which has brought the West more problems than
benefits. In my opinion, many followers of this
religion are rude, demanding and despise Germany.
Instead of halting the Islamization of Germany (and
the consequent demise of our culture and freedom),
most politicians seem to me to be more concerned
about getting reelected, and therefore they prefer
to ignore or downplay the Islam problem.
-
"I believe that German
streets are less secure than they should be given
our technological, legal and financial
opportunities.
-
"I believe that the EU
has a democratic deficit which limits my influence
as a democratic citizen.
-
"I believe that
immigration is producing major and irreversible
changes in German society. I am angry that this is
happening without the direct approval of German
citizens, but is being dictated by you to German
citizens and the next generation.
-
"I believe that the
German media is increasingly giving up its
neutrality, and that freedom of expression in this
country is only possible in a limited way.
-
"I believe that in
Germany sluggards are courted but the diligent are
scourged.
-
"I believe that it is a
shame that in Germany Jews must again be afraid to
be Jews."
Many Germans have noted the trend
toward reverse integration, in which German families are
expected to adapt to the customs and mores of migrants, rather
than the other way around.
On October 14, the Munich-based
newspaper Tageszeitung
published a heartfelt letter from "Anna," a mother of two,
who wrote about her decision to move her family out of the city
because migrants were making her life there impossible.
In the letter, addressed to Munich
Mayor Dieter Reiter, she wrote:
"Today I want to write you a
kind of farewell letter (Abschiedsbrief) about why I
and my family are leaving the city, even though probably no
one cares.
"I am 35 years old, living here
with my two young sons and my husband in an upscale
semi-detached house with parking. So you could say we are
very well off for Munich standards... We live very well with
plenty of space and next to a green park. So why would a
family like us decide to leave the city?...
"I assume that your children do
not use public facilities, that they do not use public
transportation, and that they do not attend public schools
in "problem areas." I also assume that you and other
politicians rarely if ever go for walks here.
"So on a Monday morning I
attended a neighborhood women's breakfast that was sponsored
by the City of Munich.
Here I met about 6-8 mothers,
some with their children. All of the women wore headscarves
and none of them spoke German. The organizers of the event
quickly informed me I will probably find it hard to
integrate myself here (their exact words!!!).
I should note that I am German.
I speak fluent German and I do not wear a headscarf.
So I smiled a little and said I
would try to integrate myself. Unfortunately, I brought a
salami and ham sandwich to the breakfast, to which everyone
was asked to bring something. So of course I had even less
chance of integrating.
"I was not able to speak German
to anyone at this women's breakfast, which is actually
supposed to promote integration, nor was anyone interested
in doing so. The organizers did not insist on anyone
speaking German, and the women, who appeared to be part of
an established Arab-Turkish group, simply wanted to use the
room.
"I then asked about the family
brunch... I was advised that the brunch would be held in
separate rooms. Men and women separately. At first I thought
it was a bad joke. Unfortunately, it was not...
"So my impression of these
events to promote integration is miserable. No interchange
takes place at all!!! How can the City of Munich tolerate
such a thing? In my view, the entire concept of these events
to promote integration must be called into question...
I was informed that I am not
allowed to include pork in my child's lunchbox!!! Hello?! We
are in Germany here!...
"In summary, I find conditions
here that make me feel that we are not really wanted here.
That our family does not really fit in here. My husband
sometimes says he has the feeling that we are now the
largest minority with no lobby.
For each group there is an
institution, a location, a public interest, but for us, a
heterosexual married couple with two children, not
unemployed, neither handicapped nor Islamic, for people like
us there is no longer any interest.
"When I mentioned at my son's
preschool that we are considering moving out of the city and
I told them the reasons why, I was vigorously attacked by
the school's leadership. Because of people like us, they
said, integration does not work, precisely because we remove
our children.
At least two other mothers have
become wildly abusive. The management has now branded me
"xenophobic."
"This is exactly the reason why
people like me lose their patience and we choose to vote for
other political parties... Quite honestly, I have traveled
half the world, have more foreign friends than German and
have absolutely no prejudices or aversions to people because
of their origin.
I have seen much of the world
and I know that the way integration is done here will cause
others to come to the same conclusion as we have: either we
send our children to private schools and kindergartens, or
we move to other communities.
Well then, so
long...!!!!!!!!!!!"
