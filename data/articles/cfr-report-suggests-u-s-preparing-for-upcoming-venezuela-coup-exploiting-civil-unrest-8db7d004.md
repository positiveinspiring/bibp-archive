# CFR Report Suggests U.S. Preparing for Upcoming Venezuela Coup, 
Exploiting Civil Unrest

Now, with presidential elections soon to take place pitting the
relatively popular Hugo Chavez (he
is ten percentage points ahead) against Henrique Capriles Radonski,
the ever-present concern over Anglo-American meddling in the internal
political affairs of Venezuela is becoming a legitimate issue once
again.
As one can plainly see, however, this uneasiness is not without firm
foundation in reality.
For instance, in a recent paper published by the
Council on Foreign Relations around mid-September entitled, Political
Unrest in Venezuela, the former US ambassador to the South American
nation, Patrick D. Duddy provided a clear list of possible military,
financial, and political contingency measures to be taken after
elections are held on October 7.
Duddy cites the
repeated warnings made by Chavez during the campaign regarding the
possibility of chaos, destabilization, violence and even civil war if he
fails to win the election in order to suggest that these conditions may
arise out of Chavez sabotage of Venezuelan elections.
However, the reality is that, while this
does exist within the realm of possibility, the violence and chaos that
ensues is much more likely to be a legitimate and organic reaction to
the election of Radonski who is seen as much more favorable toward
dismantling many of the social programs that Chavez heavily invested in.
Even Duddy admits in his paper that a Chavez
loss might result in riots by government workers before Capriles can be
inaugurated.
In his paper, Duddy provides several instances that he supposes are
Warning Indicators of violence and political unrest as a result of the
Venezuelan presidential elections.
Among these indicators are those such as the
following:
-
Chavez dies or an announcement is
made that his death is imminent.
-
Violent crime is allowed to surge in
the major cities before the election.
-
Weapons are distributed to the
militia.
-
Basic food items disappear.
-
Remaining independent media are
closed and/or prominent journalists are detained.
-
Sharp divisions within Chavismo
surface publicly, suggesting insiders know Chavez is failing.
-
A senior political figure close to
either Chavez or Capriles is assassinated.
-
Local supplies of gasoline are
interrupted.
Although many of these conditions
have been predicted or are quite possible inside the United States
in coming years, Duddy sees their presence in Venezuela as the signal of
apocalyptic social upheaval.
More importantly, Duddy represents this
upheaval as vital to the interests of the United States - particularly
those of U.S. involving the need to promote democracy, increase
regional cooperation, combat narcotics, and protect its economic
interests in the region.
For clarification purposes, one may translate these interests to mean,
to install puppet regimes via
destabilization programs, create U.S. regional hegemony, further the
drug trade for intelligence purposes (while imprisoning members of
the general public), and protecting private banking and corporate
interests operating or wishing to operate in the region.
-
Nevertheless, Duddy writes that
several scenarios exist as a possibility to trigger the
political unrest itself. They are, according to Duddy,
-
Chavezs defeat on October 7 looks
likely before the election.
-
Chavez wins the election - or
plausibly claims to win - and almost immediately dies or
withdraws from public life for health reasons.
-
The election is held and Capriles
wins.
-
Capriles wins and is inaugurated.
-
The election is held and the results
are too close to call or are unacceptable to the government.
In other words, Duddy suggests, the underdog Radonski is facing an uphill battle not only in terms of popular support
but also in the form of Chavezs government machine.
But, while may very well be the case, Duddy
has more obvious reasons for supporting Radonski than he initially lets
on.
Chavez, whatever one thinks of his political philosophy, has represented
a largely anti-imperialist position in recent years with his
nationalization of
oil companies,
gold industry, and even some of the
food industry away from the traditional market and foreign
governments.
Chavez also demanded
Venezuelan gold stocks be returned to Venezuela and out of Western
banks.
Radonski, on the other hand, is seen as being much more
market-friendly.
In fact, analysts from Credit Suisse, Casey Reckman
and Igor Arsenin,
stated to Bloomberg News earlier this year that,
A Capriles victory would be a good
outcome from the markets perspective, in our view, as he seems to
be a more viable presidential candidate than the opposition has
presented previously. He espouses a gradualist, inclusive,
left-of-center but market friendly approach.
Again, a translation is necessary.
Chavez represents a threat to the
Anglo-American imperialist strategy because of his refusal to engage in
unrestrained privatization. Radonski represents a much better option due
to his support for, at the very least, privatization and free market
tendencies.
Indeed, a Radonski presidency would not be the first time the current
governor of Miranda has cooperated with the Anglo-Americans. During the
aforementioned coup against Chavez in 2002, Radonski, who was Mayor of
Caracas Baruta district, was implicated in the
detention of Ramon Rodriquez
Chacin, Venezuelas Interior Minister.
Although the
charges of fomenting violence on the Cuban embassy during the coup
attempt were
ultimately dropped, the suspicion surrounding
Radonskis
allegiances remain.
After all, the
U.S. State Department was quick to go to bat for Radonski when his
trial was set to take place, claiming that his case was indicative of
Venezuelan
Human
Rights abuses.
If the claims regarding Radonskis association with pro-Zionist groups
are true, along with his questionable actions (at best) during the
Venezuelan coup, then there is little surprise as to why former
ambassador Duddy and the Anglo-American establishment would support him.
With this in mind, Duddy writes that the possibility for violence in the
event of a Chavez victory is very real.
The question facing the United
States, according to Duddy, then becomes What can we do about it?
Inside the pages of Political Unrest in Venezuela, he attempts to
answer this question or, more accurately put, how the United States can
best take advantage of such a situation.
In the section of his paper entitled, Mitigating Options, Duddy
laments the fact that The likelihood of success for unilateral U.S.
efforts is low; which itself suggests that, if support existed,
unilateral U.S. action would be given serious consideration. However, it
is important to point out that Duddy does not rule out unilateral action
as much as he merely observes that support for it would be low.
Nevertheless, Duddy states that,
multilateral efforts that include other
important regional players are far more likely to influence
Venezuelan behavior.
Thus, it is important to note that, among
Duddys Mitigating Options, there falls the subcategories of
diplomatic, economic and financial, and military options.
In terms of diplomacy, Duddy suggests that the U.S.,
together with like-minded nations...
demand that the OAS declare Venezuela in breach of its obligations
as a signatory of the Inter-American Democratic Charter and
encourage a secretary-general-led mission to Caracas.
He also proposes that the United States
involve
the United Nations, the European Union, and other international
partners, in order to,
to explicitly endorse regional efforts to
restore democracy.
Unfortunately, Duddy does not define what a regional effort to restore
democracy would look like.
However, considering the recent
history of Anglo-American interference, along
with other international coalitions
of the willing, we can only imagine that the results would bring
little benefit to the Venezuelan people.
In terms of Economic and Financial Options, Duddy writes that, in the
event of violence or interruption of democracy,
the United States could freeze
individual bank accounts of key figures involved or responsible and
seize assets in the United States.
It could also arrange for the
proceeds of Venezuelan government-owned corporate entities like
CITGO to be held in escrow accounts until democracy is restored and
encourage other important trading partners (i.e. Canada, Spain,
France, Brazil) to do the same.
He also suggests that the,
United States could block access to
CITGOs refining facilities in the United States and consider
prohibiting PDVSA oil sales to the United States while the
government status is uncertain.
In other words, Duddy is proposing that the
United States seize, freeze, and otherwise sanction Venezuelan assets
until the election results are established to the satisfaction of the
Anglo-American oligarchy.
Clearly, a Chavez government does not fit
the accepted mold formed by the shadow government currently guiding
world society. Thus, one must naturally wonder just what the world power
elite has in store for Venezuela on October 7.
With this in mind, the next section of Duddys paper, entitled Military
Options, is much more concerning.
For instance, in this section, Duddy writes that,
The United States could encourage other
Latin American militaries, as well perhaps as the Spanish, to
communicate to the Venezuelan military the importance of complying
with constitutional mandates, respecting human rights, and
preserving democracy.
While Chavez loyalists dominate the
Venezuelan high command, it is not clear to what extent they control
the middle ranks. Nor is it clear to what extent the militarys
loyalty to Chavezs Bolivarian movement would trump other
considerations.
In the abortive coup of 2002 the
military temporarily removed Chavez but also restored him to power.
In this short section, Duddy is doing more
than simply hinting that the United States, along with other Latin
American client states, encourage the Venezuelan military to depose
Hugo Chavez and install a different government.
Notice that nowhere does Duddy suggest the
possibility that Radonski might be the culprit in contested elections
and post-election violence.
The reason for this is that Radonski is not
the target of the Anglo-American destabilization efforts - Chavez is. It
is also ironic because Radonski has himself been involved in the
instigation of political violence in the past.
Indeed, Duddys interpretation of encouragement, taken in the context
of recent NATO-related adventures, sounds dangerously close to
direction and outright involvement.
As Lee Brown of Venezuela Analysis
writes,
However there are obvious concerns that
this fits neatly with the objectives of those within the right-wing
opposition in Venezuela who are planning for the non-recognition of
the coming elections if, as expected, Hugo Chavez wins.
With the polls showing strong leads for
Hugo Chavez, a campaign is already underway by sections of the
right-wing opposition coalition to present any electoral defeat as
being down to Chavez-led
fraud.
This has seen baseless attacks on the
independent National Electoral Council (CNE,) which has overseen all
of Venezuelans elections described as free and fair by a range of
international observers. The opposition has announced plans to place
tens of thousands of witnesses at polling stations on election day
and then, illegally to release its own results ahead of the official
results in a clear bid to discredit them.
These plans have sharpened fears that
opposition-led disruptions and destabilization will follow their
defeat. This could easily meet Duddys condition of 'an outbreak of
violence and/or interruption of democracy'.
Clearly the paper raises the spectre
that, as with the US-backed coup in 2002, the US could seek to blame
any right wing opposition-led post election disruption on the Hugo
Chavez government, with the US then taking the measures Duddy
suggests.
The 'options' suggested by Patrick Duddy,
a former Bush era Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western
Hemisphere Affairs, form part of ongoing hostilities to the
democratically elected Chavez government from neo-cons in
Washington. Connie Mack, chairman of the U.S.
House
Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, has openly advocated that
Venezuela is added to the US lists of states that sponsor terrorism.
Whilst Republican Presidential candidate
Mitt Romney earlier this year attacked Venezuela during the US
Presidential campaign as a threat to national security and accused
Venezuela of 'spreading dictatorships & tyranny throughout Latin
America'.
With less than one month to go until the
Venezuelan people go to the polls, and with it looking likely that
they will re-elect Hugo Chavez, solidarity in defence of the right
of the people to choose their own government free from outside
intervention clearly remains vital.
Indeed, the entire purpose of Duddys paper
seems to be a preparation at the academic level for a second coup
attempt in Venezuela using contested elections as a justification.
Much like the destabilizations taking place
all over the world, particularly in the Middle East, the Anglo-Americans
appear to be posturing for political, financial, proxy, or even direct
involvement in the domestic affairs of yet another sovereign nation
using civil unrest as a justification.
More interesting still is the fact that the
civil and political unrest used to justify this involvement has been
fomented by the Anglo-American intelligence networks to begin with.
There is little doubt that streets full of angry demonstrators,
regardless of the reason for their discontent, will be broadcast back to
the United States and the rest of the Western world as anti-Chavez
activists and peaceful protesters.
As what little liberty the Venezuelan people
had begins to flow down the drain, the corporate media will laud the
crowing of the new free market king in the place where a democratically
elected President once stood.
Like the
unfortunate people of Libya, the
Venezuelans will wake up to a much darker world upon completion of the
Anglo-American destabilization plan.
Americans, however, will just wake up none
the wiser.
