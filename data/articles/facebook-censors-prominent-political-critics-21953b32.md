Weve previously documented that the
largest social media websites censor government criticism.
For example, Facebook pays low-wage foreign
workers
to delete certain content based upon a
censorship list.
For example, Facebook deletes accounts created
by any Palestinian resistance groups. Today, Facebook deactivated the
Facebook accounts of some of the leading American political critics.
For example,
-
Former diplomat and U.C. Berkeley
Professor Emeritus Peter Dale Scott told us that his Facebook
account was suddenly deactivated today without any justification.
-
So did Richard Gage, founder of
Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth.
-
Michael Rivero, owner of the
popular website
What Really Happened:
As I illustrated at the top of the
page, last night while I was sleeping the Magic Elves turned my
Facebook account back on.
I understand that most if not all of
the other accounts were also switched back on. Frankly, I am
honored to have been included in the list of leading political
critics thus attacked. I feel like I made the varsity team!
Not a word of explanation has been forthcoming from Facebook.
This, I think, rules out an external hacker attack.
The lesson to be learned here is that the alternative media has
more power to affect change than we ourselves fully comprehend,
and it is time to use that power.
Infowars - one of the worlds
most popular alternative media sites -
confirms that accounts for the following political commentators have
been shut down:
Indeed, Facebook
told an Infowars reporter last year not to post anything political:
Be careful making about making political
statements on facebook
facebook is about building relationships not a
platform for your political viewpoint. Dont antagonize your base. Be
careful and congnizat (sic) of what you are preaching.
And Infowars also confirms that the Facebook
account for
Natural News - one of the
most popular alternative health sites - has been shut down.
Reports are that the Facebook accounts of a
number of other political critics were suspended or deactivated today as
well, including:
-
Amber Lyon,
3-time Emmy Award winning CNN reporter
-
Anthony J. Hilder, popular radio host
-
Michael Murphy
-
Mike Skuthan
-
Packy Savvenas
-
Robert M. Bowman, former director of the
Star Wars defense program under President Ronald Reagan
-
Sean Wright and Katherine Albrect
-
Wacboston
-
Weare Change, popular
citizen journalism group
-
William Lewis
-
William Rodriguez,
9/11 hero
