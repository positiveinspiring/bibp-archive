What in the world is China up to?
-
Why are the Chinese hoarding so much
gold?
-
Does China plan to back the Yuan with
gold and turn it into a global reserve currency?
-
Could it be possible that China actually
intends for the Yuan to eventually replace the U.S. dollar as
the primary reserve currency of the planet?
Most people in the western world assume that
China just wants a "seat at the table" and is content to let the United
States run the show.
But that isn't the case at all. The truth is
that China doesn't just want to compete with the United States. Rather,
China actually plans to replace the United States as the
dominant economic power on the planet. In fact, China already accounts
for more global trade than the United States does.
So what would happen one day if China announced
that it was backing the Yuan with gold and that it would no longer be using
the U.S. dollar in international trade? It would cause a financial shift so
cataclysmic that it is hard to even imagine.
Most of those that write about the "death of the
U.S. dollar" usually fail to point out that China is holding a lot of the
cards as far as the fate of the dollar is concerned.
China owns about a
trillion dollars of
our debt, China is the second largest economy on the planet, and nobody
uses the dollar in international trade more than China does except for the
United States.
Up until now, China has had to use the U.S.
dollar in international trade because there has not been an attractive
alternative. But a gold-backed Yuan would change all of that very rapidly.
And without a doubt, the Chinese government has
already been very busy promoting the use of the Yuan in international trade.
In a recent note,
John McCormick of RBS Group stated the following...
Financial crises in the US and Europe mean
the world needs a new, more stable global reserve currency, and trade in
RMB is growing rapidly. In the FX market, for example, our figures show
that volumes are now worth around USD 5-6 billion daily - double what
they were a year ago.
A number of factors suggest that the Chinese
authorities want to make RMB internationalization happen by 2015.
For China, having a global reserve currency is
not just about economics. It is also about power.
McCormick ended his recent note this way...
Chinas new leadership faces a number of
problems. The countrys economy is slowing and, although we would expect
the rate of GDP growth to pick up a little, it is unlikely to be a steep
rebound.
But promoting RMB as a global reserve
currency, with all the economic benefits that will bring in addition to
exerting more political influence on the global stage, clearly remains
high on their agenda.
Similar sentiments were echoed in a recent
article
in the Wall Street Journal...
Beijing is undertaking a long, gradual
campaign to establish the Yuan as a more market-oriented, international
currency. China's State Council, or cabinet, said in a statement this
month that the country would draft a plan to allow the Yuan to become
fully convertible.
Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China is
guiding the currency higher and set the median point of its permitted
daily trading band last week at the strongest level ever.
We don't hear much about these sorts of things
in the western media, but the convertibility of the Chinese Yuan is a very
big deal.
Up until recently, the Yuan was only directly
convertible into dollars and yen. But now that is rapidly changing. So far
this year, the Chinese government has entered into currency convertibility
agreements
with Australia and New Zealand.
So instead of having to change Yuan into U.S.
dollars to trade with Australia and New Zealand, now China can cut U.S.
dollars completely out of the process.
But right now there is nothing that really gives
the Chinese Yuan a significant competitive edge over the U.S. dollar.
If Chinese authorities truly want the Yuan to
end up replacing the U.S. dollar as the primary reserve currency of the
planet, they need to do something that will make the rest of the world want
to use it.
And they could do that by backing the Yuan with
gold. In fact, there are persistent rumors that China has been busily
preparing for that.
For example,
the Economic Policy Journal recently pointed out that Dr. Pippa
Malmgren, the President and founder of Principalis Asset Management
who once worked in the White House as an adviser to President Bush, is
claiming that China has plans to turn the Yuan into "a hard, gold-backed
currency" that will have a distinct competitive edge over the rapidly
depreciating paper currencies that the rest of the globe is currently
using...
The most interesting piece of the puzzle is
that the Chinese have emerged as the biggest buyers of gold, mainly
off-market. They want the Yuan to emerge as a hard, gold-backed currency
in a world where everyone else has chosen to inflate and devalue.
The recent bilateral currency deals with
Australia, France, Russia and Singapore, and many others, reflect this
desire to displace the USD as the worlds reserve currency.
It may be an interesting and long race
between the Chinese reaching for convertibility and the Western central
banks straining credibility.
Other analysts are also fully convinced that the
goal of the Chinese is a gold-backed Yuan.
The following is what money manager Stephen Leeb
told King World News recently...
Countries have been battling each other in
order to cheapen their currencies. The problem with a cheaper currency
is that commodities cost more. So China has decided to opt for a higher
currency.
The move in the Yuan overnight was one of
the most significant upticks I have seen.
Like I said, the Yuan moved to an all-time
high. The Yuan has advanced roughly 5% against the US dollar in just
nine months. China also imported over 200 tons of gold for the most
recent month. That is an extraordinary number. At that rate thats over
2,400 tons of gold per year on an annualized basis.
This simply speeds up the point at which
China will be the largest gold holder in the world.
China saw gold come
down and they didnt just buy on the dip, instead they bought as much as
the market would give them. And, again, you see the Yuan going up so
that is making the price of gold even cheaper for the Chinese.
Its only a matter of time before the
Chinese back the Yuan with gold. This will push the Yuan front and
center as a key element in terms of being part of the worlds reserve
currency basket. China gets the message. They are doing whatever it
takes to establish their dominance in the world, particularly in the
commodity arena.
Their currency is flying and they are
importing as much gold as they possibly can.
And without a doubt, China has been hoarding
massive amounts of gold. Everyone agrees on that. But what nobody knows is
exactly how much gold China currently has stockpiled, because China is not
telling anybody.
One recent estimate put China's gold reserves
at more
than 7,000 tons of gold, but it could potentially be far higher than
that. When China does finally tell the rest of us how much gold they have,
they will probably be just a move or two away from checkmate.
What we do know is that China is importing
absolutely enormous amounts of gold right now even though China is also the
number one gold producer on the planet.
According to
Reuters, more than 223 tons of gold was imported into China from Hong
Kong in March. That smashed the previous record of 114 tons in December.
Overall, Chinese imports of gold from Hong Kong
tripled in 2012, and the final number for 2013 is going to absolutely smash
what we saw in 2012.
Obviously something is happening.
China is massively hoarding gold at the same
time that it is trying to substantially raise the international influence of
the Yuan.
It doesn't take a genius to see where all of
this is headed.
If China does decide to back the Yuan with gold
and no longer use the U.S. dollar in international trade, it will have
devastating effects on the U.S. economy. Demand for the U.S. dollar and U.S.
debt would drop like a rock, and prices on the things that we buy every day
would soar.
At that point you could forget about cheap
gasoline or cheap Chinese imports. Our entire way of life depends on the
U.S. dollar being the primary reserve currency of the world and being able
to import things very inexpensively. If the rest of the world (led by China)
starts to reject the U.S. dollar, it would result in a massive tsunami of
currency coming back to our shores and a very painful adjustment in our
standard of living.
Today, most U.S. currency is actually used
outside of the United States. If someday
that changes and we are no longer able to export our inflation that is going
to mean big trouble for us.
So keep an eye on China, and look out for any
news about the Yuan.
It won't happen next week or next month, but
eventually we could see China back the Yuan with gold.
When that happens, it is going to be a complete
and utter financial disaster for the United States.
