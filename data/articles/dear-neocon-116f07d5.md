Dear Neocon,
You believe you are God's gift to the United States of America.
If only people "thought" more like you this
nation would be in great shape.
Your feeble mind parrots the words you've listened to on the radio or
TV. You speak of liberty and the principals that made this country
great, while supporting candidates whom will ruin those ideas.
You feel "awake" and "informed" because some
self proclaimed "great American" or conservative "leader" disc jockey
told you it was so.
You proudly say you support the troops and even have a very nice yellow
ribbon magnet on the back of your car. Yey!! Your sense of patriotism is
appreciated. Yet, you fail to realize that it is nothing more than a
rouse. You believe that America's way of life is threatened by "scary"
Arab men thousands of miles away.
Formally CIA assets, those groups serve no
other purpose than to scare you into supporting the loss of life and
limb of our brothers and sisters. You are willing to give up your
freedoms for liberty.
You are allowing America to become the "land
of the coward - home of the slave".
You support billions of dollars going
towards the killing of thousands of people, including our own, for the
sake of an undefined victory.
You feel as the outsider thinking out of the box, a true conservative,
simply due to your support of an underdog posing as a real conservative.
Truth be told, the only real conservative with liberty in mind is the
the candidate who "can't win". You hear and repeat the line as if it
were a junior school rumor that would bring you popularity and
acceptance.
You drop the name Reagan as if it were a
holy word. When Reagan won a crucial line, now forgotten, was - Barry
Goldwater won, it just took years to happen (or something like that, it
was before my time.)
If this is you... Don't worry. I used to be you.
Research, think for yourself, break away
from your trance, or just take the easy way out and follow the sheep to
the slaughter.
Will you wait for the next actor to play the role of a true
conservative? Or will you break your peer pressure built mold and think
for yourself? The troops you so support have cast their monetary vote.
The records of the candidates are out there for public review.
The future of America rests in your hands.
