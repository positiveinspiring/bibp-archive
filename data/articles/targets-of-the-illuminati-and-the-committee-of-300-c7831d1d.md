# Targets of The Illuminati and The Committee of 300

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_illuminati_12c.htm

1. To establish a
One World Government/New World Order with a unified church
and monetary system under their direction. The One World Government
began to set up its church in the 1920:s and 30:s, for they realized
the need for a religious belief inherent in mankind must have an
outlet and, therefore, set up a "church" body to channel that belief
in the direction they desired.
2. To bring about the utter destruction of all national
identity and national pride, which was a primary consideration if
the concept of a One World Government was to work.
3. To engineer and bring about the destruction of religion,
and more especially, the Christian Religion, with the one exception,
their own creation, as mentioned above.
4. To establish the ability to control of each and every
person through means of mind control and what
Zbignew
Brzezinski called techonotronics, which would create
human-like robots and a system of terror which would make Felix
Dzerzinhskis Red Terror look like children at play.
5. To bring about the end to all industrialization and the
production of nuclear generated electric power in what they call
"the post-industrial zero-growth society". Excepted are the
computer- and service industries. US industries that remain will be
exported to countries such as Mexico where abundant slave labor is
available. As we saw in 1993, this has become a fact through the
passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as
NAFTA. Unemployables in the US, in the wake of industrial
destruction, will either become opium-heroin and/or cocaine addicts,
or become statistics in the elimination of the "excess population"
process we know of today as
Global 2000 Report.
6. To encourage, and eventually legalize the use of drugs
and make pornography an "art-form", which will be widely
accepted and, eventually, become quite commonplace.
7. To bring about depopulation of large cities
according to the trial run carried out by the Pol Pot regime in
Cambodia. It is interesting to note that Pol Pots genocidal
plans were drawn up in the US by one of the Club of Romes
research foundations, and overseen by Thomas Enders, a
high-ranking State Department official. It is also interesting that
the committee is currently seeking to reinstate the Pol Pot butchers
in Cambodia.
8. To suppress all scientific development except for those
deemed beneficial by the Illuminati. Especially targeted is nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes. Particularly hated are the fusion
experiments currently being scorned and ridiculed by the
Illuminati and its jackals of the press. Development of the fusion
torch would blow the Illuminatis conception of "limited natural
resources" right out of the window. A fusion torch, properly used,
could create unlimited and as yet untapped natural resources, even
from the most ordinary substances. Fusion torch uses are
legion, and would benefit mankind in a manner which, as yet, is not
even remotely comprehended by the public.
9. To cause. by means of limited wars in the advanced
countries, by means of starvation and diseases in the Third World
countries, the death of three billion people by the year
2050, people they call "useless eaters". The Committee of 300
(Illuminati) commissioned Cyrus Vance to write a paper on this
subject of how to bring about such genocide. The paper was produced
under the title "Global
2000 Report" and was accepted and approved for action by
former President James Earl Carter, and Edwin Muskie,
then Secretary of States, for and on behalf of the US Government.
Under the terms of the
Global 2000 Report, the population of the US is to be reduced by 100 million by the year
of 2050.
10. To weaken the moral fiber of the nation and to demoralize
workers in the labor class by creating mass unemployment. As jobs
dwindle due to the post industrial zero growth policies introduced
by the Club of Rome, the report envisages demoralized and
discouraged workers resorting to alcohol and drugs. The youth of the
land will be encouraged by means of rock music and drugs to rebel
against the status quo, thus undermining and eventually destroying
the family unit. In this regard, the Committee commissioned
Tavistock Institute to prepare a blueprint as to how this could
be achieved. Tavistock directed Stanford Research to undertake the
work under the direction of Professor Willis Harmon. This
work later became known as the "Aquarian
Conspiracy".
11. To keep people everywhere from deciding their own
destinies by means of one created crisis after another
and then "managing" such crises. This will confuse and demoralize
the population to the extent where faced with too many choices,
apathy on a massive scale will result. In the case of the US, an
agency for Crisis Management is already in place. It is called the
Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), whose existence I first enclosed in 1980.
12. To introduce new cults and continue to boost those
already functioning which include rock music gangsters such as the
Rolling Stones (a gangster group much favored by European Black
Nobility), and all of the Tavistock-created rock groups which
began with the Beatles.
13. To continue to build up the cult of Christian
Fundamentalism begun by the British East India Companys servant
Darby, which will be misused to strengthen the Zionist State of
Israel by identifying with the Jews through the myth of "Gods
chosen people", and by donating very substantial amounts of
money to what they mistakenly believe is a religious cause in the
furtherance of Christianity.
14. To press for the spread of religious cults such as the
Moslem Brotherhood, Moslem Fundamentalism, the Sikhs,
and to carry out mind control experiments of the Jim Jones and "Son
of Sam" type. It is worth noting that the late Khomeini was a
creation of British Military Intelligence Div. 6, MI6. This detailed
work spelled out the step-by-step process which the US Government
implemented to put Khomeini in power.
15. To export "religious liberation" ideas around the world
so as to undermine all existing religions, but more especially the
Christian religion. This began with the "Jesuit Liberation
Theology", that brought an end to the Somoza Family rule
in Nicaragua, and which today is destroying El Salvador, now 25
years into a "civil war". Costa Rica and Honduras are also embroiled
in revolutionary activities, instigated by the Jesuits. One very
active entity engaged in the so-called liberation theology, is the
Communist-oriented Mary Knoll Mission. This accounts for the
extensive media attention to the murder of four of Mary Knolls
so-called nuns in El Salvador a few years ago. The four nuns
were Communist subversive agents and their activities were widely
documented by the Government of El Salvador. The US press and the
new media refused to give any space or coverage to the mass of
documentation possessed by the Salvadorian Government, which proved
what the Mary Knoll Mission nuns were doing in the country. Mary
Knoll is in service in many countries, and placed a leading role
in bringing Communism to Rhodesia, Mo√ßambique, Angola and South
Africa.
16. To cause a total collapse of the worlds economies
and engender total political chaos.
17. To take control of all foreign and domestic
policies of the US.
18. To give the fullest support to supranational institutions
such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the Bank of International Settlements, the World Court
and, as far as possible, make local institutions less effective, by
gradually phasing them out or bringing them under the mantle of
the UN.
19. To penetrate and subvert all governments, and work from
within them to destroy the sovereign integrity of the nations
represented by them.
20. To organize a world-wide terrorist apparatus and
to negotiate with terrorists whenever terrorist activities take
place. It will be recalled that it was Bettino Craxi, who
persuaded the Italian and US Governments to negotiate with the Red
Brigades kidnapers of Prime Minister Moro and General Dozier. As an
aside, Dozier was placed under strict orders not to talk what
happened to him. Should he ever break that silence, he will no doubt
be mad "a horrible example of", in the manner in which Henry
Kissinger dealt with Aldo Moro, Ali Bhutto and
General Zia ul Haq.
21. To take control of education in America with the
intent and purpose of utterly and completely destroying it. By 1993,
the full force effect of this policy is becoming apparent, and will
be even more destructive as primary and secondary schools begin to
teach "Outcome Based Education" (OBE).
