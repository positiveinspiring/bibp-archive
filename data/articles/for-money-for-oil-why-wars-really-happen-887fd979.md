Many discussions of lies that launch wars
quickly come around to the question "Well then why did they want the war?"
There is usually more than one single motive involved, but the motives are
not terribly hard to find.
Unlike many soldiers who have been lied to, most of the key war deciders,
the masters of war who determine whether or not wars happen, do not in any
sense have noble motives for what they do.
Though noble motives can be found
in the reasoning of some of those involved, even in some of those at the
highest levels of decision making, it is very doubtful that such noble
intentions alone would ever generate wars.
Economic and imperial motives have been offered by presidents and congress
members for most of our major wars, but they have not been endlessly hyped
and dramatized as have other alleged motivations. War with Japan was largely
about the economic value of Asia, but fending off the evil Japanese emperor
made a better poster.
The
Project for the New American Century, a think tank
pushing for war on Iraq, made its motives clear a dozen years before it got
its war - motives that included U.S. military dominance of the globe with
more and larger bases in key regions of "American interest."
That goal was
not repeated as often or as shrilly as,
-
"WMD"
-
"terrorism"
-
"evildoer"
-
"spreading democracy"
The most important motivations for wars are the least talked about, and the
least important or completely fraudulent motivations are the most discussed.
The important motivations, the things the war masters mostly discuss in
private, include electoral calculations, control of natural resources,
intimidation of other countries, domination of geographic regions, financial
profits for friends and campaign funders, the opening up of consumer
markets, and prospects for testing new weapons.
If politicians were honest, electoral calculations would deserve to be
openly discussed and would constitute no ground for shame or secrecy.
Elected officials ought to do what will get them reelected, within the
structure of laws that have been democratically established. But our
conception of democracy has become so twisted that reelection as a
motivation for action is hidden away alongside profiteering. This is true
for all areas of government work; the election process is so corrupt that
the public is viewed as yet another corrupting influence.
When it comes to
war, this sense is heightened by politicians' awareness that wars are
marketed with lies.
IN THEIR OWN WORDS
The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was a think tank from 1997
to 2006 in Washington, D.C. (later revived in 2009).
Seventeen members of PNAC served in high positions in the
George W. Bush administration,
including,
-
Vice President
-
Chief of Staff to the Vice President
-
Special
Assistant to the President
-
Deputy Secretary of "Defense"
-
ambassador to
Afghanistan and Iraq
-
Deputy Secretary of State
-
Under Secretary of State
One individual who was part of PNAC and later of the Bush Administration,
Richard Perle, together with another Bush bureaucrat-to-be Douglas Feith,
had worked for Israeli Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996 and produced
a paper called
A Clean Break - A New Strategy for Securing the Realm.
The
realm was Israel, and the strategy advocated was hyper-militarized
nationalism and the violent removal of regional foreign leaders including
Saddam Hussein.
In 1998, PNAC published an open letter to President Bill Clinton urging him
to adopt the goal of regime change for Iraq, which he did.
That letter
included this:
"[I]f Saddam does acquire the capability to deliver weapons of mass
destruction, as he is almost certain to do if we continue along the present
course, the safety of American troops in the region, of our friends and
allies like Israel and the moderate Arab states, and a significant portion
of the world's supply of oil will all be put at hazard."
In 2000, PNAC published a paper titled
Rebuilding America's Defenses.
The
goals set forth in this paper fit much more coherently with the actual
behavior of the masters of war than do any notions of "spreading democracy"
or "standing up to tyranny." When Iraq attacks Iran we help out. When it
attacks Kuwait we step in. When it does nothing we bomb it.
This behavior
makes no sense in terms of the fictional stories we're told, but makes
perfect sense in terms of these goals from PNAC:
-
maintaining U.S. preeminence
-
precluding the rise of a great power
rival
-
shaping the international security order in line with American principles
and interests
PNAC determined that we would need to,
"fight and decisively win multiple,
simultaneous major theater wars" and "perform the 'constabulary' duties
associated with shaping the security environment in critical regions."
In
the same 2000 paper, PNAC wrote:
"While the unresolved conflict with Iraq
provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial
American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime
of Saddam Hussein.
The placement of U.S. bases has yet to
reflect these realities... From an American perspective,
the value of such bases would endure even should Saddam pass from the scene.
Over the long term, Iran may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests
in the Gulf as Iraq has. And even should U.S.-Iranian relations improve,
retaining forward- based forces in the region would still be an essential
element in U.S. security strategy..."
These papers were published and widely available years before the invasion
of Iraq, and yet to suggest that U.S. forces would try to stay and build
permanent bases in Iraq even after killing Saddam Hussein was scandalous in
the halls of Congress or the corporate media.
To suggest that the War on
Iraq had anything to do with our imperial bases or oil or Israel, much less
that Hussein did not as yet have weapons, was heretical. Even worse was to
suggest that those bases might be used to launch attacks on other countries,
in line with PNAC's goal of "maintaining U.S. preeminence."
And yet Supreme
Allied Commander Europe of NATO from 1997 to 2000 Wesley Clark claims that
in 2001, Secretary of War Donald Rumsfeld put out a memo proposing to take
over seven countries in five years:
-
Iraq
-
Syria
-
Lebanon
-
Libya
-
Somalia
-
Sudan
-
Iran
The basic outline of this plan was confirmed by none other than former
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who in 2010 pinned it on former Vice
President Dick Cheney:
"Cheney wanted forcible 'regime change' in all Middle Eastern countries that
he considered hostile to U.S. interests, according to Blair.
'He would have
worked through the whole lot, Iraq, Syria, Iran, dealing with all their
surrogates in the course of it - Hezbollah, Hamas, etc.,' Blair wrote.
'In
other words, he [Cheney] thought the world had to be made anew, and that
after
11 September, it had to be done by force and with urgency. So he was
for hard, hard power. No ifs, no buts, no maybes.'"
Crazy? Sure! But that's what succeeds in Washington.
As each of those
invasions happened, new excuses would have been made public for each. But
the underlying reasons would have remained those quoted above.
CONSPIRACY THEORIES
Part of the ethos of "toughness" required of U.S. war makers has been a
habit of thought that detects a major, global, and demonic enemy behind
every shadow.
For decades the enemy was the Soviet Union and the threat of
global communism.
But the Soviet Union never had the global military
presence of the United States or the same interest in empire building. Its
weapons and threats and aggressions were constantly exaggerated, and its
presence was detected anytime a small, poor nation put up resistance to U.S.
dominance.
Koreans and Vietnamese, Africans and South Americans couldn't
possibly have their own sovereign interests, it was assumed. If they were
refusing our unsolicited guidance, somebody had to be putting them up to it.
A commission created by President Reagan called the
Commission on Integrated
Long-Term Strategy proposed more small wars in Asia, Africa, and Latin
America.
Concerns included,
-
"U.S. access to critical regions"
-
"American
credibility among allies and friends"
-
"American self-confidence"
-
"America's ability to defend its interests in the most vital regions, such
as the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean, and the Western Pacific"
But what should the public be told we and our interests were being defended
against? Why, an evil empire, of course!
During the so-called Cold War, the
communist conspiracy justification was so common that some very intelligent
people believed U.S. war making couldn't go on without it.
Here's Richard
Barnet:
"The myth of monolithic Communism - that all activities of people everywhere
who call themselves Communists or whom J. Edgar Hoover calls Communists are
planned and controlled in the Kremlin - is essential to the ideology of the
national security bureaucracy.
Without it the President and his advisers
would have a harder time identifying the enemy. They certainly could not
find opponents worthy of the 'defense' efforts of the mightiest military
power in the history of the world."
Ha! My apologies if you had any drink in your mouth and sprayed it on your
clothing as you read that.
As if the wars will not go on! As if the wars
were not the reason for the communist threat, rather than the other way
around!
Writing in 1992, John Quigley could see this clearly:
"[T]he political reform that swept eastern Europe in 1989-90 left the cold
war on the ash heap of history. Even so, our military interventions did not
end. In 1989, we intervened to support a government in the Philippines and
to overthrow one in Panama. In 1990, we sent a massive force to the Persian
Gulf.
"The continuation of military interventions is not, however, surprising,
because the aim all along... has been less to fight communism than to
maintain our own control."
The threat of the Soviet Union or communism was, within a dozen years
replaced with the threat of al Qaeda or terrorism.
Wars against an empire
and an ideology would become wars against a small terrorist group and a
tactic. The change had some advantages. While the Soviet Union could
publicly collapse, a secretive and widely dispersed collection of terrorist
cells to which we could apply the name al Qaeda could never be proven to
have gone away.
An ideology could fall out of favor, but anywhere we fought
wars or imposed unwelcome control, people would fight back, and their
fighting would be "terrorism"
because it was directed against us. This was a
new justification for never-ending war.
But the motivation was the war, not
the crusade to eliminate terrorism which crusade would, of course, produce
more terrorism.
The motivation was U.S. control over areas of "vital interest," namely
profitable natural resources and markets and strategic positions for
military bases from which to extend power over yet more resources and
markets, and from which to deny any imaginable "rivals" anything resembling
"American self-confidence."
This is, of course, aided and abetted by the
motivations of those who profit financially from the war making itself.
FOR MONEY AND MARKETS
Economic motivations for wars are not exactly news.
The most famous lines
from Smedley Butler's
War Is A Racket are not actually in that book at all,
but in a 1935 issue of the Socialist newspaper Common Sense, where he wrote:
"I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that
period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business,
for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for
capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American
oil interests in 1914.
I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the
National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of
half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I
helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown
Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the
American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the
American fruit companies in 1903.
In China in 1927 I helped see to it that
Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have
given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket
in three districts. I operated on three continents."
This explanation of motives for wars was not usually presented in Butler's
colorful language, but it wasn't secret either.
In fact, war propagandists
have long argued for portraying wars as beneficial to big business whether
or not they actually would be:
"For the sake of the business men the war must appear as a profitable
enterprise. L.G. Chiozza, Money, M.P., published a statement in the London
Daily Chronicle for August 10th, 1914, which is a pattern for this sort of
thing.
He wrote:
"'Our chief competitor both in Europe and outside it will be unable to
trade, and at the conclusion of the War the unmistakable antagonism which
German aggression is everywhere arousing will help us to keep the trade and
shipping we will win from her.'"
To Carl von Clausewitz, who died in 1831, war was,
"a continuation of
political relations, a carrying out of the same by other means."
That sounds
about right, as long as we understand that war makers often have a
preference for the means of war even when other means might achieve the same
results.
In an August 31st, 2010, Oval Office speech praising the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan, President Obama exclaimed:
"New markets for our goods
stretch from Asia to the Americas!"
In 1963, John Quigley, not yet an
analyst of war lies, was a Marine assigned to lecture his unit on world
affairs.
When one of his students objected to the idea of fighting in
Vietnam, Quigley,
"explained patiently that there was oil underneath
Vietnam's continental shelf, that Vietnam's large population was an
important market for our products, and that Vietnam commanded the sea route
from the Middle East to the Far East."
But let's start at the beginning.
Before he became president, William
McKinley said,
"We want a foreign market for our surplus products."
As
president, he told Governor Robert LaFollette of Wisconsin he wanted,
"to
attain U.S. supremacy in world markets."
When Cuba was in danger of
achieving its independence from Spain without assistance, McKinley persuaded
Congress not to recognize the revolutionary government.
After all, his goal
was not Cuban independence, or Puerto Rican or Filipino independence. When
he took over the Philippines, McKinley thought he was advancing the goal of
"supremacy in world markets."
When the people of the Philippines fought
back, he called it an "insurrection."
He described the war as a humanitarian
mission for the Filipinos' own good. McKinley pioneered by saying first what
later presidents would say as a matter of routine when engaged in wars for
resources or markets.
A month before the United States entered World War I, on March 5, 1917, the
U.S. ambassador to Great Britain, Walter Hines Page, sent a cable to
President Woodrow Wilson, reading in part:
"The pressure of this approaching crisis, I am certain, has gone beyond the
ability of the Morgan financial agency for the British and French
governments.
The financial necessities of the Allies are too great and
urgent for any private agency to handle, for every such agency has to
encounter business rivalries and sectional antagonism. It is not improbable
that the only way of maintaining our present preeminent trade position and
averting a panic is by declaring war on Germany."
When peace had been made with Germany ending World War I, President Wilson
kept U.S. troops in Russia to fight the Soviets, despite earlier claims that
our troops were in Russia in order to defeat Germany and intercept supplies
bound for Germany.
Senator Hiram Johnson (P., Calif.) had famously said of
the launching of the war:
"The first casualty when war comes, is truth."
He
now had something to say about the failure to end the war when the peace
treaty had been signed. Johnson denounced the ongoing fighting in Russia and
quoted from the Chicago Tribune when it claimed that the goal was to help
Europe collect Russia's debt.
In 1935, considering the brewing financial interest in war with Japan,
Norman Thomas pointed out that, at least from a national perspective, if not
from the perspective of particular profiteers, it made no sense:
"Our whole
trade with Japan, China, and the Philippines in 1933 amounted to 525 million
dollars or enough to have carried on the First World War for less than two
and one-half days!"
Yes, he called it the "first" world war, because he saw what was coming.
One
year before the attack on Pearl Harbor, a State Department memo on Japanese
expansionism said not a word about independence for China.
But it did say:
"...our general diplomatic and strategic position would be considerably
weakened - by our loss of Chinese, Indian, and South Seas markets (and by
our loss of much of the Japanese market for our goods, as Japan would become
more and more self-sufficient) as well as by insurmountable restrictions
upon our access to rubber, tin, jute, and other vital materials of the Asian
and Oceanic regions."
During World War II, Secretary of State Cordell Hull chaired a,
"committee on
political problems" which decided to handle perceived public fears that the
United States would try to "feed, clothe, reconstruct, and police the
world."
The fears would be calmed by convincing the public that U.S. goals
were to prevent another war and to provide,
"free access to raw materials and
[foster] international commerce."
The words of the
Atlantic Charter ("equal
access") became "free access," meaning access for the United States, but not
necessarily for anybody else.
During the Cold War, the stated reasons for wars changed more than the real
ones, as fighting communism gave cover for killing people to win markets,
foreign labor, and resources.
We said we were fighting for democracy, but we
backed dictators like,
-
Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua
-
Fulgencio Batista in
Cuba
-
Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic
The result was a bad
name for the United States, and the empowering of leftist governments in
reaction to our interference.
Senator Frank Church (D., Idaho) concluded
that we had,
"lost, or grievously impaired, the good name and reputation of
the United States."
Even if war makers did not have economic motives, it would still be
impossible for corporations not to see economic gains as fortuitous
byproducts of wars.
As George McGovern and William Polk noted in 2006:
"In
2002, just before the American invasion [of Iraq], only one of the world's
ten most profitable corporations was in the oil and gas field; in 2005 four
of the ten were. They were Exxon-Mobil and Chevron Texaco (American) and
Shell and BP (British).
The Iraq war doubled the price of crude; it would go
up another 50 percent during the first months of 2006."
FOR THE PROFITS
Profiting from the waging of war has been a common part of U.S. wars since
at least the Civil War.
During the 2003 War on Iraq Vice President Cheney
directed massive no-bid contracts to a company, Halliburton, from which he
was still receiving compensation, and profited from the same illegal war he
defrauded the American public into launching.
British Prime Minister Tony
Blair was a little more circumspect in his war profiteering.
The
Stop the
War Coalition kept up with him, however, writing in 2010:
"[Blair] earns £2 million a year for one day a month's work, from the US
investment bank J.P. Morgan, who just happen to be making huge profits from
financing 'reconstruction' projects in Iraq. There's no end of gratitude for
Blair's services to the oil industry, the Iraq invasion so clearly being
aimed at controlling the world's second largest oil reserves.
The Kuwaiti
Royal Family paid him around a million to produce a report on Kuwait's
future, and business deals though a consultancy he has set up to advise
other countries in the Middle East are projected to earn around £5 million a
year.
Just in case he runs short, he has signed up with the South Korean oil
firm UI Energy Corporation, which has extensive interests in Iraq and which
some estimates say will eventually net him £20 million."
FOR MONEY AND CLASS
Another economic motivation for war that is often overlooked is the
advantage war presents for a privileged class of people who are concerned
that those denied a fair share of the nation's wealth might rebel.
In 1916
in the United States, socialism was gaining in popularity, while any sign of
class struggle in Europe had been silenced by World War I.
Senator James
Wadsworth (R., N.Y.) proposed compulsory military training out of fear that
"these people of ours shall be divided into classes." The poverty draft may
serve a similar function today.
The American Revolution may have as well.
World War II put a stop to depression-era radicalism that saw the Congress
of Industrial Organizations (CIO) organizing black and white workers
together.
World War II soldiers took their orders from Douglas MacArthur, Dwight
Eisenhower, and George Patton, men who in 1932 had led the military's
assault on the "Bonus Army," World War I veterans camped out in Washington,
D.C., pleading to be paid the bonuses they'd been promised. This was a
struggle that looked like a failure until World War II veterans were given
the GI Bill of Rights.
McCarthyism led many struggling for the rights of working people to place
militarism ahead of their own struggles for the latter half of the twentieth
century.
Barbara Ehrenreich wrote in 1997:
"Americans credited the Gulf War with 'bringing us together.' Serbian and
Croatian leaders solved their people's post-communist economic discontents
with an orgy of nationalist violence."
I was working for low-income community groups on
September 11, 2001, and I
recall how all talk of a better minimum wage or more affordable housing went
away in Washington when the war trumpets sounded.
FOR OIL
A major motivation for wars is the seizing of control over other nations'
resources.
World War I made clear to war makers the importance of oil to
fueling the wars themselves, as well as to fueling an industrial economy,
and from that point forward a major motivation for war has been the conquest
of nations that have supplies of oil.
In 1940 the United States produced a
majority (63 percent) of the world's oil, but in 1943 Secretary of the
Interior Harold Ickes said,
"If there should be a World War III it would have to be fought with someone
else's petroleum, because the United States wouldn't have it."
President Jimmy Carter decreed in his last State of the Union address:
"An
attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will
be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of
America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary,
including military force."
Whether or not the first Gulf War was fought for oil, President
George H. W.
Bush said it was.
He warned that Iraq would control too much of the world's
oil if it invaded Saudi Arabia. The U.S. public denounced "blood for oil,"
and Bush quickly changed his tune.
His son, attacking the same country a
dozen years later, would allow his vice president to plan the war in secret
meetings with oil executives, and would work hard to impose a "hydrocarbons
law" on Iraq to benefit foreign oil companies, but he would not try to
publicly sell the war as a mission to steal Iraqi oil. Or at least, that was
not the primary focus of the sales pitch.
There was a September 15, 2002,
Washington Post headline that read "In Iraqi War Scenario, Oil Is Key Issue
-
U.S. Drillers Eye Huge Petroleum Pool."
Africom, the U.S. military's command structure for that seldom discussed
chunk of land larger than all of North America, the African continent, was
created by President George W. Bush in 2007.
It had been envisioned a few
years earlier, however, by the African Oil Policy Initiative Group
(including representatives of the White House, Congress, and the oil
corporations) as a structure,
"which could produce significant dividends in
the protection of U.S. investments."169
According to General Charles Wald,
deputy commander of U.S. forces in Europe,
"A key mission for U.S. forces [in Africa] would be to insure that Nigeria's
oilfields, which in the future could account for as much as 25 percent of
all U.S. oil imports, are secure."
I wonder what he means by "secure." Somehow I doubt his concern is to boost
the oilfields' self-confidence.
U.S. involvement in Yugoslavia in the 1990s was not unrelated to lead, zinc,
cadmium, gold, and silver mines, cheap labor, and a deregulated market. In
1996 U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown died in a plane crash in Croatia
along with top executives for Boeing, Bechtel, AT&T, Northwest Airlines, and
several other corporations that were lining up government contracts for
"reconstruction."
Enron, the famously corrupt corporation that would
implode in 2001, was a part of so many such trips that it issued a press
release to state that none of its people had been on this one. Enron gave
$100,000 to the Democratic National Committee in 1997, six days before
accompanying new Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor to Bosnia and Croatia and
signing a deal to build a $100 million power plant.
The annexation of
Kosovo, Sandy Davies writes in
Blood on Our Hands,
"
did succeed in creating a small militarized buffer state between
Yugoslavia and the projected route of the AMBO oil pipeline through
Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Albania. This pipeline is being built, with U.S.
government support, to provide the United States and Western Europe with
access to oil from the Caspian Sea...
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
explained the underlying strategy in 1998.
'This is about America's energy
security,' he explained'... It's very important to us that both the
pipeline map and the politics come out right.'"
Longtime master of war
Zbigniew Brzezinski spoke at a RAND Corporation forum
on Afghanistan in a Senate caucus room in October 2009.
His first statement
was that,
"withdrawal from Afghanistan in the near future is a No-No."
He
offered no reasons why and suggested that his other statements would be more
controversial.
During a subsequent question-and-answer period, I asked Brzezinski why such
a statement should be considered uncontroversial when approximately half of
Americans at that time opposed the occupation of Afghanistan. I asked how he
would respond to the arguments of a U.S. diplomat who had just resigned in
protest.
Brzezinski responded that a lot of people are weak and don't know
any better, and they should be ignored. Brzezinski said one of the main
goals for the War on Afghanistan was to build a north-south gas pipeline to
the Indian Ocean.
This didn't noticeably shock anyone in the room.
In June 2010, a military-connected public relations firm persuaded the New
York Times to run a front-page story proclaiming the discovery of vast
mineral wealth in Afghanistan. Most of the claims were dubious, and those
that were solid were not new. But the story had been planted at a time when
senators and congress members were beginning to turn ever so slightly
against the war.
Apparently the White House or the Pentagon believed the
possibility of stealing Afghans' lithium would generate more war support in
Congress.
FOR EMPIRE
Fighting for territory, whatever rocks may lie beneath it, is a venerable
motivation for war.
Up through World War I and including it, empires battled
each other for various territories and colonies. In the case of World War I
there were Alsace-Lorraine, the Balkans, Africa, and the Middle East. Wars
are also fought to assert influence rather than ownership in regions of the
globe.
The U.S. bombing of Yugoslavia in the 1990s may have involved a
desire to keep Europe subordinate to the United States through NATO, an
organization that was in danger of losing its reason to exist. A war can
also be fought for the purpose of weakening another nation without occupying
it. National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft said one purpose of the Gulf
War was to leave Iraq with "no offensive capability."
The United States'
success in this regard came in handy when it attacked Iraq again in 2003.
The Economist was concerned to keep the War on Afghanistan going in 2007:
"Defeat would be a body blow not only to the Afghans, but to the NATO
alliance."
The British Pakistani historian Tariq Ali commented:
"As ever,
geopolitics prevails over Afghan interests in the calculus of the big
powers. The basing agreement signed by the U.S. with its appointee in Kabul
in May 2005 gives the Pentagon the right to maintain a massive military
presence in Afghanistan in perpetuity, potentially including nuclear
missiles.
That Washington is not seeking permanent bases in this fraught and
inhospitable terrain simply for the sake of 'democratization and good
governance' was made clear by NATO's Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer
at the Brookings Institution in February 2009: a permanent NATO presence in
a country that borders the ex-Soviet republics, China, Iran, and Pakistan
was too good to miss."
FOR THE GUNS
Another motivation for wars is the justification they provide for
maintaining a large military and producing more weapons.
This may have been
a key motivation for various U.S. military actions following the Cold War.
Talk of a peace dividend faded as wars and interventions proliferated. Wars
also appear to be fought on occasion in a manner that allows the use of
particular weapons even though the strategy makes no sense as a means to
victory.
In 1964, for example, U.S. war makers decided to bomb North Vietnam
even though their intelligence told them the resistance in the South was
home grown.
Why? Possibly because bombs were what they had to work with and - for
whatever other reasons - they wanted war.
As we've seen above, nuclear bombs
were dropped unnecessarily on Japan, the second one even more unnecessarily
than the first. That second one was a different type of bomb, a plutonium
bomb, and the Pentagon wanted to see it tested. World War II in Europe had
drawn to a close with a completely unnecessary U.S. bombing of the French
town of Royan - again despite the French being our allies.
This bombing was
an early use of napalm on human beings, and the Pentagon apparently wanted
to see what it would do.
MACHISMO
But men cannot live by bread alone.
Wars fought against a global menace
(communism, terrorism, or another) are also wars fought to display one's
prowess to bystanders, thus preventing the toppling of dominoes - a danger
that can always be precipitated by a loss of "credibility." Remarkably, in warmonger-speak "credibility" is a synonym for "bellicosity," not "honesty."
Thus, nonviolent approaches to the world lack not only violence but also
"credibility."
There is something indecent about them.
According to Richard
Barnett,
"Military officers in the [Lyndon] Johnson Administration consistently
argued the risks of defeat and humiliation were greater than the risks of
mining Haiphong, obliterating Hanoi, or bombing 'selected targets' in
China."
They knew the world would be outraged by such actions, but somehow there is
nothing humiliating about the prospect of being ostracized as murderous
madmen. Only softness can be humiliating.
One of the most dramatic news stories that came out of Daniel Ellsberg's
release of
The Pentagon Papers was the news that 70 percent of the
motivation of the people behind the War on Vietnam was "to save face."
It
wasn't to keep the communists out of Peoria or to teach the Vietnamese
democracy or anything so grand. It was to protect the image, or perhaps the
self-image, of the war makers themselves.
Assistant Secretary of "Defense"
John McNaughton's March 24, 1965, memo said U.S. goals in horrifically
bombing the people of Vietnam were 70 percent "to avoid a humiliating U.S.
defeat (to our reputation as guarantor)," 20 percent to keep territory out
of Chinese hands, and 10 percent to permit people a "better, freer way of
life."
McNaughton was concerned that other nations, wondering whether or not the
United States would have the toughness to bomb the hell out of them too,
might ask questions like:
"Is the U.S. hobbled by restraints which might be relevant in future cases
(fear of illegality, of U.N., of neutral reaction, of domestic pressures, of
U.S. losses, of deploying U.S. ground forces in Asia, of war with China or
Russia, of use of nuclear weapons, etc.)?"
That's a lot to prove you're not afraid of.
But then we did drop a lot of
bombs on Vietnam trying to prove it, over 7 million tons, as compared to the
2 million dropped in World War II.
Ralph Stavins argues in
Washington Plans
an Aggressive War that John McNaughton and William Bundy understood that
only withdrawal from Vietnam made sense, but backed escalation out of fear
of seeming personally weak.
In 1975, after defeat in Vietnam, the masters of war were even touchier
about their machismo than usual. When the Khmer Rouge seized a U.S.-
registered merchant vessel, President Gerald Ford demanded the release of
the ship and its crew. The Khmer Rouge complied.
But U.S. jet fighters went
ahead and bombed Cambodia as a means of showing that, as the White House put
it, the United States,
"still stood ready to meet force with force to protect
its interests."
Such displays of toughness are understood in Washington, D.C., to not only
advance careers but also to enhance reputations in perpetuity. Presidents
have long believed they could not be remembered as great presidents without
wars.
Theodore Roosevelt wrote to a friend in 1897,
"In strict confidence
I
should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one."
According to novelist and author Gore Vidal, President John Kennedy told him
that a president needed a war for greatness and that without the Civil War,
Abraham Lincoln would have been just another railroad lawyer.
According to
Mickey Herskowitz, who had worked with George W. Bush in 1999 on the
latter's "autobiography," Bush wanted a war before becoming president.
One
disturbing thing about all this longing for war is that, while many of the
motivations seem base, greedy, foolish, and despicable, some of them seem
very personal and psychological.
Perhaps it's "rational" to want world
markets to buy U.S. products and to produce them more cheaply, but,
-
Why must
we have "supremacy in world markets?"
-
Why do we collectively need
"self-confidence?"
-
Isn't that something each individual person finds on
their own?
-
Why the emphasis on "preeminence"?
-
Why is there so little talk in
the back rooms about being protected from foreign threats and so much about
dominating foreigners with our superiority and fearsome "credibility"?
-
Is
war about being respected?
When you combine the illogic of these motivations for war with the fact that
wars so often fail on their own terms and yet are repeated time and time
again, it becomes possible to doubt that the masters of war are always
masters of their own consciousness.
The United States did not conquer Korea
or Vietnam or Iraq or Afghanistan.
Historically, empires have not lasted.
In
a rational world we would skip the wars and go straight to the peace
negotiations that follow them. Yet, so often, we do not.
During the War on Vietnam, the United States apparently began the air war,
began the ground war, and proceeded with each step of escalation because the
war planners couldn't think of anything else to do other than ending the
war, and despite their high confidence that what they were doing would not
work.
After a lengthy period during which these expectations were fulfilled,
they did what they could have done from the start and ended the war.
