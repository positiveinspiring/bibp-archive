The RIIA & CFR
The first two groups created by the Round Table were the British
Royal
Institute for International Affairs (RIIA) in 1920 and the
American Council
on Foreign
Relations (CFR) in 1921. In fact the original plans for both were
drawn up during the Paris Peace conference of 1919.
Though they were given
different names to mask their autonomy, the RIIA and CFR are just
sub-branches of the RhodesMilner Round Table.
"At the end of the war of 1914 [World War 1], it became clear that the
organization of this system [the Round Table] had to be greatly extended
This front organization, called the Royal Institute of International
Affairs, had as its nucleus in each area the existing submerged Round Table
Group. In New York it was known as the Council on Foreign Relations, and was
a front for J. P. Morgan and Company.
Dr. Carroll Quigley, Tragedy and
Hope
Later the plan was changed to create an ostensible autonomy because, it
seemed unwise to set up a single institute with branches. It had to be made
to appear that the
C.F.R. in America, and the R.I.I.A. in Britain, were really independent
bodies, lest the American public become aware the C.F.R. was in fact a
subsidiary of the Round Table Group and react in patriotic fury. This is the
group which designed the United Nations the first major successful step on
the road to a World Superstate.
At least forty-seven C.F.R. members were
among the American delegates to the founding of the United Nations in San
Francisco in 1945
Today the C.F.R. remains active in working toward its
final goal of a government over all the world a government which the
Insiders and their allies will control. The goal of the C.F.R. is simply to
abolish the United States with its Constitutional guarantees of liberty.
And
they don't even try to hide it. Study No. 7, published by the C.F.R. on
November 25, 1959, openly advocates building a new international order
[which] must be responsive to world aspirations for peace, [and] for social
and economic change ... an international order [code word for world
government] ... including states labeling themselves as 'Socialist'
[Communist]."
Gary Allen, None Dare Call it Conspiracy
The CFR is a private group not affiliated with the U.S. government, but made
to look that way.
Just as the Federal Reserve, the name Council on
Foreign Relations sounds official to the unsuspecting ear, and they even
print a magazine called Foreign Affairs to help pacify the organization in
the public mind. But the truth is, the CFR is not a council belonging to the
U.S. government and is, in fact, a secret society masquerading as an
official organization.
If they called it Republicrats for World Government
or Demopublican Global Governance Group then the herd might notice. Even
if they called it the American Royal Institute for International Affairs
the sheeple might raise an eyebrow. This is the same reason our American
leaders are called Presidents and not Prime Ministers, even though they are
all royalty.
Admiral Chester Ward, was a US Judge Advocate General of the Navy and CFR
member for sixteen years.
He said the purpose of the CFR was,
promoting
disarmament and the submergence of US sovereignty and national independence
into an all-powerful one world government.
In his book, Kissinger on the
Couch, Ward wrote,
(the)
lust to surrender the sovereignty and
independence of the United States is pervasive throughout most of the
membership, and particularly in the leadership of several divergent cliques
that make up what is actually a polycentric organization.
"The most powerful clique in these (CFR) groups has one objective in common:
they want to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty and the national
independence of the U.S. They want to end national boundaries and racial and
ethnic loyalties supposedly to increase business and ensure world peace.
What they strive for would inevitably lead to dictatorship and loss of
freedoms by the people.
Harpers, July l958
The Council on Foreign Relations is the establishment. Not only does it
have influence and power in key decision-making positions at the highest
levels of government to apply pressure from above, but it also announces and
uses individuals and groups to bring pressure from below, to justify the
high level decisions for converting the U.S. from a sovereign Constitutional
Republic into a servile member state of a one world dictatorship.
Congressman John Rarick, 1971
CFR membership is made up of past, present, and future Presidents,
Secretaries of State, Secretaries of Defense, Ambassadors, Senators,
Congressmen, Judges, Federal Reserve System presidents and chairmen,
bankers, military leaders, media owners/personalities, lobbyist lawyers,
corporate executives, thinktank executives, and university presidents.
CFR membership is composed of the most influential Americans of the century.
Just look at the household names belonging to the CFR: George Bush, Bill
Clinton, Hilary Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, John F.
Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, Herbert Hoover, Robert Kennedy, Al Gore,
Condoleezza Rice, Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell, Strobe Talbot, James Woolsey,
John Dulles, Michael Dukakis, Fred Thompson, John McCain, Barack Obama, Mitt
Romney, Rudy Giuliani, John Edwards, Michael Bloomberg, John Kerry, Thomas
Kean, Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jonathan Bush, Angelina Jolie,
Dan Rather, Diane Sawyer, Barbara Walters, Consuelo Mack, Warren Beatty,
William Buckley Jr., Newt Gingrich, Alan Greenspan, Paul Wolfowitz, Averill
and Pamela Harriman, David, Nelson, and Jay Rockefeller, William and
McGeorge Bundy, Brent Scowcroft, George Shultz, and Paul Warburg.
Here is just a sampling of the CFRs Corporate Members:
Although the membership of the CFR is a veritable whos who in big
business and the media, probably only one person in a thousand is familiar
with the organization itself and even fewer are aware of its real purposes.
During its first fifty years of existence, the CFR was almost never
mentioned by any of the moguls of the mass media.
And when you realize that
the membership of the CFR includes top executives from the New York Times,
the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Knight newspaper chain, NBC,
CBS, Time, Life, Fortune, Business Week, US News & World Report, and many
others, you can be sure that such anonymity is not accidental; it is
deliberate
They control or own major newspapers, magazines, radio and
television networks, and they control the most powerful companies in the
book publishing business.
Gary Allen, The Rockefeller File
Nearly every U.S. President since its inception has been a CFR member. Even
the non CFR Presidents have had administrations full of members. For instance
Ronald Reagan wasnt a CFR member, but his Vice President George Bush was CFR, and so were 28 members of his transition team alone.
George W. Bush is
not a CFR member either, but his father and uncle are, his Vice President
Dick Cheney is, and his administration is swarming with them. At the
founding meeting of the United Nations there were 74 CFR members.
The
Clinton administration had over 100 CFR members. The Nixon administration
had over 115 CFR members all in key Executive branch positions, most of whom
continued through the Ford years, and a few of whom are still in power
today.
The Council on Foreign Relations (like Skull and Bones) always promotes
candidates from both the Democrat and Republican parties, thus ensuring a
win for the New World Order.
-
In 1952 and 1956 CFR Republican Dwight
Eisenhower ran against CFR Democrat Adlai Stevenson.
-
In 1960 it was CFR Republican Richard Nixon against CFR Democrat John F. Kennedy.
-
In 1964
neither candidate was CFR, but Barry Goldwater was a Freemason, and Lyndon
Johnsons administration was full of CFR members.
-
In 1968 it was CFR Republican Richard Nixon versus CFR Democrat Hubert Humphrey.
-
In 1972 was
Nixon again versus CFR Democrat George McGovern.
-
In 1976 CFR Republican Gerald
Ford lost to CFR Democrat Jimmy Carter.
-
In 1980 was Mason Republican Ronald
Reagan versus CFR Democrat Jimmy Carter and CFR Independent John Anderson.
-
1984 was Reagan again against CFR Democrat Walter Mondale.
-
In 1988 CFR Republican George Bush ran against CFR Democrat Michael Dukakis.
-
1992 was
Bush again running against CFR Democrat Bill Clinton.
-
In 1996 Clinton was
challenged by CFR Republican Bob Dole.
-
In 2000 CFR Democrat Al Gore lost to
Skull and Bones Republican George
W. Bush (with CFR running mate Dick Cheney)
In 2004 Bush was challenged by
brother Bonesman and CFR Democrat John Kerry. The CFR owns the monopoly
market on both Presidents and Presidential candidates.
In the current 2008
presidential race, the CFR has propped up Democrats Hilary Clinton, Barack
Obama, John Edwards, and Republicans Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, Mitt
Romney and Fred Thompson.
The only two 2008 candidates not belonging to
secret societies or in favor of a
New World Order are/were
Ron Paul and
Dennis Kucinich.
"The chief problem of American political life
has been how to make the two
Congressional parties more national and international. The argument that the
two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of
the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to
doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost
identical, so that the American people can 'throw the rascals out' at any
election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy."
Dr.
Carroll Quigley, Tragedy and Hope
"The members of the council [On Foreign Relations] are persons of much more
than average influence in their community. They have used the prestige that
their wealth, their social position, and their education have given them to
lead their country toward bankruptcy and military debacle. They should look
at their hands. There is blood on them the dried blood of the last war and
the fresh blood of the present one [the Korean War]."
Chicago Tribune
editorial, Dec. 9, 1950
Almost all CIA directors have been CFR members, including Allen Dulles,
Richard Helms, William Colby, George Bush, William Webster, James Woolsey,
John Deutsch, and William Casey.
Many U.S. Senators were also members
including, David Boren, William Bradley, John Chafee, William Cohen,
Christopher Dodd, Bob Graham, Joseph Lieberman, George Mitchell, Claiborne
Pell, Larry Pressler, Charles Robb, John D. Rockefeller, and William Roth
Jr.
For U.S. Congressional Representatives there has been Howard Berman,
Thomas Foley, Sam Gejdenson, Richard Gephardt, Newt Gingrich, Amory Houghton
Jr., Nancy Lee Johnson, John Lewis, Robert Matsui, Dave Mccurdy, Eleanor
Homes Norton, Thomas El Petri, Carlos Romero Barceló, Patricia Schroeder,
Peter Smith, Olympia Snow, John Spratt, and Louis Stokes.
As for Secretaries
of Defense: Neil McElroy, Robert Gates, Robert McNamara, Melvin Laird, Eliot
Richardson, Donald Rumsfeld, Harold Brown, Casper Weinberger, Frank
Carlucci, and Dick Cheney.
And U.S. Ambassadors to Australia, Britain,
Chile, Czech Republic, France, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Nigeria,
Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, South Africa, and Syria.
This
is just a sampling of the high-level government positions held by hundreds if
not thousands of CFR members.
"If the CFR had millions of members like, say, the Presbyterian Church, this
list might not mean much. But the CFR only has 3,200 members."
Robert Anton
Wilson
"The plan, as publicly stated by the CFR's Richard Gardner,
part-time State
Department functionary and Columbia University Professor of Law and
International Organization, amounts to this: Instead of trying to make the
UN a complete world dictatorship immediately, the Establishment will
identify different problems in different countries.
Then they will propose a
solution, which can only be achieved by some kind of international agency,
so that each country concerned will be forced to surrender another segment
of its national independence. Gardner considers this piecemeal approach the
practical road to the end of nationhood
