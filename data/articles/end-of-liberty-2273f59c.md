The National Inflation Association (NIA) has now released 'End of Liberty',
NIA's new documentary. 'End of Liberty' is the most eye-opening film ever
produced about the United States government.
The film would be funny if it wasn't so true. It
promises to be the most important movie you will ever watch in your entire
life.
'End of Liberty' exposes from a real life perspective how the U.S. is headed
for a complete societal collapse. All Americans are now experiencing
countless warning signs on a daily basis that a societal collapse is near.
Unfortunately, most Americans don't understand the significance of these
warning signs. Each warning sign by itself doesn't appear to have a lot of
meaning, but together these warning signs present a very detailed picture of
the current state of the U.S. economy and where this country is soon headed.
'End of Liberty' is over an hour long and features Gerald Celente,
the most accurate trends forecaster in U.S. history.
'End of Liberty' also features NIA's President
Gerard Adams, who on February 5th purchased call options
in the silver ETF at $0.89 (NIA publicly announced his purchase to NIA
members on February 8th) that he sold last week at $4.25 for a
gain of 378% in a little over eight months.
'End of Liberty' was written with the help of
thousands of NIA members who submitted their ideas of warning signs that a
societal collapse is near.
NIA's critically acclaimed documentaries 'Meltup', 'The Dollar Bubble', and
'Hyperinflation Nation' have now received a combined 2.1 million views. In
all three of NIA's previous documentaries, NIA strongly urged its viewers to
consider investing into gold and silver, in order to protect themselves from
a collapsing U.S. dollar.
Since the release of NIA's first documentary
'Hyperinflation Nation' on June 28th, 2009,
-
gold has risen by 48% from $940
per ounce to a new all time high of $1,388 per ounce
-
silver has risen
by 74% from $14.13 per ounce to a new 30-year high of $24.65 per ounce
