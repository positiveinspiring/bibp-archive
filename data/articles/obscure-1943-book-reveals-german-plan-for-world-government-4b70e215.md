The man who arranged
for Hitler to become Chancellor of Germany, Von Papen (r),
had also written about the
possibility of a "European Federation"
under strict German control
with Berlin as its glorious Axis mundi.
As Paul Joseph Watson reported in his May 11 2009 article Top
Nazis Planned EU-Style Fourth Reich, Top Nazi industrialists
were present at the cradle of the European Union and, through the creation
of the Bilderberg group, guided her growth during all stages of her
development into the post-war era.
As reported in the article, a group of top
ranking German industrialists planned for an economic super state founded
upon a common market for the whole of Europe.
It has also been confirmed that
the Bilderberg group had their plans for a
European Union and currency in place by at least 1955.
The idea of uniting Europe in a closed
trade bloc is no longer shocking if Germany assumes domination over such
a bloc., wrote one of the founding Nazi-ideologues in the 19th century.
The man who arranged for Hitler to become
Chancellor of Germany, Von Papen, had also written about the
possibility of a "European Federation" under strict German control of
course, with Berlin as its glorious Axis mundi.
It has been abundantly pointed out that German
industrialists have aligned themselves with the Anglo-American establishment
after the war, teaming up to form what is better known as
the
New World Order.
While Europe was blindfolded by terror and
death, a book was published by New York publisher Charles Scribners Sons
which carried the ominous title The
Thousand-Year Conspiracy.
In the book, the author Paul Winkler
offers a fascinating insight into the people who are in the business of
engineering financial crises and wars in Prussia from its very conception
way back in the dark ages.
To gain some understanding about the origin and
significance of this Prusso-Teutonic establishment, as Winkler calls it,
let us follow the author down into his in-depth research.
A Wartime Publication
You may argue that that the hour is late in producing a review of a book
published over 65 years ago, but the obscurity in which the book lay hidden
all that time and its relevance to our own day, I think justifies an
attempt.
Pulled from underneath a great stack of wartime
literature, and cleared from a thick layer of dust, The Thousand Year
Conspiracy should raise some eyebrows- not to say make you fall from your
chair in amazement. Around the time the book hit the stores in the U.S., few
people understood the full implication of this manuscript.
All eyes were on the Fuhrer, who was barking
orders at trembling generals- all sweaty palms and dripping foreheads- as
they scurried in and out of his reinforced bunker.
As one of the instruments in their well-planned
push for world domination, the German aristocratic elite (Winkler calls them
Junkers throughout the book) created the biggest bully of them all,
Adolf Hitler, to antagonize the world.
As far as the Junkers were concerned, Hitler was
a dream come true as he was reaping havoc around the globe, thereby forcing
his enemies to commence with a world government rising from the ruins of the
War that ensued.
Around the same time European Parliament founder
H.R. Nord promoted his utopian world federation, Winkler published
his book in the full realization that just such a federation was in the
making- not necessarily under the chairmanship of Nazis- but rather in the
hands of the people who funded the Nazis into power back in the 1930s.
Empires come and go, Winkler argues, tyrants
rise and fall- but an unholy alliance holds firm throughout history, guiding
the course of events as the world turns. The real controllers seldom appear
out from the shadows.
They rather stay out of sight, promoting,
funding and supervising certain individuals who will do their bidding in the
full light of day.
An Unholy Alliance
As the muffled sound of planes was heard snoring overhead, Winkler sets out
to identify what he calls the forces behind the forces:
an alignment of two powers that have
dominated Germany from the 13th century onward.
The first power he discerns in the vast greyness
of history is the Order of the Teutonic Knights, which in both
financial and military regard left
the Knights Templar far behind them and are
credited for the founding of the militaristic state of Prussia.
The Order itself, argues Winkler, were the
true heirs to the Holy Roman Empire and destined to dominate the
continent ever since. Where the French Templars were doomed for destruction
by the beginning of the 14th century, the Teutonic Order
flourished all the more, evolving into the Prussian Order State in
the next couple of centuries.
To capture the true meaning of this medieval
order of fighting monks, the author convincingly points out that the
Teutonic knights have very early on in history aligned themselves with the
second dominant power - which can be identified fairly easily as the
European, and especially, German nobility.
The historic significance of this partnership
can hardly be exaggerated.
Winkler asserts that the original intentions of
the German crusaders to the Holy Land had nothing whatsoever to do with some
vague ideology to liberate the Holy Land, but rather with a hidden agenda
the German aristocratic elite had prepared long before it even considered
taking up the sword to drive out the evil pagans:
"The Order itself had among its secret aims
that of serving as a Hospital for German nobility.(
) The Knights used
the term Hospital in a symbolic sense (
) and concealed behind it one
of the aims of the Order- conspiracy to promote the interests of a
caste.
While the German aristocracy spun an economic
web around Northern Europe with the help of the German Hanseatic League, the
Teutonic Order excelled in matters of military conquest.
When these two continents collided, the tectonic
energy that was released created the Prusso-Teutonic alliance.
Under the protection of the Order, Winkler
writes, a cast of nobles, enjoying the favour and complicity of the
Knights, settled in the conquered countries.
These "Junkers" in turn tried to appropriate
for their exclusive advantage the very aims and traditions which the
Order itself had carried down from the Germano-Roman emperors.
Under the header The New Order is an Old
Order, the author expands further on this strange no-mans-land between
light and shadow in which the Junkers operate.
Winkler:
The Prusso-Teutonics know that military
occupation of France cannot last forever. Besides, they have probably
considered the possibility of a German defeat which would bring about
the fall of the Nazi regime.
He then cites Hitlers call for a New Economic
Order and places it into the context of the Old Order of German nobility in
conjunction with battle hardened Teutonic Knights:
This New Order is in its entirety the old
Prussian scheme (
), which ninety years before Hitlers reign provided
the blueprint for the creation of European economic unity under
domination of a Prussian Germany.
It also provided for subsequent expansion of
this Prusso-Teutonic Europe through invasion of the markets of other
continents, and establishment of protectorates throughout the world.
The Method
The way this Prusso-Teutonic group went about this planned penetration of
international markets, Winkler, with a keen sense of understatement, calls
A Most Unorthodox Financial Plan.
This plan had already been put into action by
this band of robber-barons in the 1920s, thus facilitating the Nazis in
their rise to power.
For that group, Winkler states, the job
in mind had to be done in five stages. (
):
-
The purpose of the first period,
inflation, was to permit the looting of the entire German middle
class. This was accomplished to the advantage of the Junker
class which was able to make money by the tremendous rise in
prices, due to scarcity of agricultural products; and also to
the advantage of bankers and big industrialists speculating
directly on inflation, like Stinnes, Thyssen, and Krupp. These
men succeeded, during this period, in buying up tremendous
quantities of industrial properties with borrowed money which
they were able to repay easily after the currency was
devaluated.
-
After October 11, 1924, the next
step was to encourage the inflow of foreign money under the
guise of long and short term credits. Without these fresh funds
there would indeed have been nothing left to pick from German
pockets. It was (
) essential, above all, to inspire confidence
throughout the world regarding the mark, so that foreign credits
would begin flowing in heavily.
-
During the years 1929-1930 the
direction of this operation was reversed. (
) German financial
and governmental circles, painting the countrys situation in
darker and darker colors, artificially created a panic. This
produced, in German and foreign financial circles, a flight
from the mark(
) Finally, on July 13, 1931, under Bruenings
administration, the financial authorities of Germany took
advantage of the climax of the panic they themselves had
provoked, to have the government declare a moratorium on
internal and external debt payments, and they instituted
control of exchange on a permanent basis. This control of
exchange (
) took Germany off the gold standard.
-
The introduction of control of
exchange (
) represented complete seizure by the state - and by
groups hiding behind the state- of all export and import
business. (
) Heavy industry grew increasingly prosperous.
Private business suffered and prices of commodities doubled. (
)
This promoted psychological conditions favorable for the
rearmament program, and prepared the way for the foreign
conquest long anticipated by the Prusso-Teutonics.
-
Properly speaking, conquest- and the
attempt at economic domination of world markets which it
implies- may me considered the fifth phase of the same program.
The Fifth Phase
One has to wear blinders the size of grapefruits not to see the same agenda
unfolding before our very eyes today.
The people we are dealing with are obviously
quite different from the obscure, extravagant and otherwise curious little
subgroups that make out the bulk of secret societies. Most of them do
nothing all day but mix mysticism and alchemy for their own metaphysical
pleasure. The Junkers, its obvious, do not stem from the 18th
century
Bavarian Order of Illuminati, a trifle as
far as secret societies go- the opposite is the case rather.
This particular Order compares to the Teutonic
Order about the same way the Lions Club compares to Bilderberg.
Many other secret societies sprang up in the
course of the last centuries, adding up to little more than Rosicrucian-like
cults, indulging themselves on beer, occultism and sausages (although it
counted some first-class snakes among its members).
Nor can these forces behind the forces be
traced back to
the Knights Templar and their heirs, the Freemasons,
who get to shroud themselves in perpetual fog while exercising relative
little power in fact.
However rich their temples may be carved, it is
only from the very highest of degrees that any real power emanates - but
they can really no longer be considered freemasons at all, but rather
members of the Anglo-Teutonic establishment, chuckling over their underlings
and their mystic scribbles with relish. If this order is so shadowy and
secret, how come we know all this- you may wonder.
Well, this is due more to the lack of
concealment by medieval scholars than to the resourcefulness of modern ones.
As the author has pointed out, a German
aristocratic elite has used Hitler as a steppingstone towards its final
goal, to create a world government based upon old feudal principles.
Winkler concludes
his book with a warning:
Hitler is not the real problem in Germany
today. His days are probably numbered but whatever may be the manner of
his disappearance from the world scene, the Prusso-Teutonic problem will
still be there, essentially unchanged.
