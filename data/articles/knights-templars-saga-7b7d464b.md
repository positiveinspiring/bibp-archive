# Knights Templars Saga

Introduction
The Order of the Knights Templars has its
roots in the crusades.
To some extent, we had explored it in our previous works,
The New Masonic Order (1995) and Global Freemasonry (2002).
This order was
originally founded to fight for Christianity, but over time-as the Templars
acquired immense power, adopted heretical teachings, and established a
capitalist system based on material gain, their order fell afoul of the Church.
Rumors circulating about the
Templars led to years of
investigations, revealing that the order was blasphemous and that it performed
black magic rituals, similar to today's satanic sects.
The order was
subsequently declared unlawful. The Knights' liquidation and arrest arose from a
joint decision by the French King and the Pope.
Some historians regard the Templars' trial and subsequent liquidation as one of the most significant social
events of the Middle Ages.
Ironically,
the truly interesting part of the Knights Templar's Saga began only after the
order was liquidated.
According to the generally accepted view, the order went
underground, developing a deep animosity for monotheistic religions and the
Church in particular and, in the long-term, transmuted into the organization
known today as Freemasonry.
The Masons' antireligious philosophy and involvement
in revolutions and political movements is a consequence of their Templars
ancestry.
In other words, the Knights Templars still
survive in the present, under the name of Freemasonry.
Those who reach the
highest degrees of Masonry are granted Templar-inspired titles such as "Guardian
of the Temple." In the United States, some lodges that convene under the name of
the Knights Templar are affiliated with Masonry.
Masonry, on the other hand,
continues the Templars' foremost tradition of opposing religion, as well as
being actively avaricious, now and again relying on extra-legal methods similar
to the Mafia's.
Compelling examples-including the P2 Masonic lodge and murders
of Jack the Ripper - are scrutinized in this report's later chapters. We will also
investigate the Templar/Masons' Syndication's impact on Turkey's recent history.
All this will demonstrate that accepted
history facts, and especially current developments, are not always what they
appear to be; and that behind processes and events thought to be developing
naturally, shadowy designs can be detected.
