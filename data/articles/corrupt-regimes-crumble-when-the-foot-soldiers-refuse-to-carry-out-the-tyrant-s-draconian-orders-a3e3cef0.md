"Its Always When The Foot Soldiers of the Elite
Wont Carry Out the Forms of
Draconian Control
that These Dead Regimes Crumble"
Pulitzer prize winning reporter Chris Hedges pointed out recently (starting
at 5:05):
I was in Leipzig on November 9, 1989 with leaders of East German opposition
and they told me that - perhaps within a year there would be free passes
back and forth across the Berlin wall.
Within a few hours, the Berlin Wall, at least as far as an impediment to
human traffic, did not exist.
Week after week, month after month, these clergy in Leipzig held these
candlelit vigils. And it was slow at first
people forget. Just like the
Egyptian revolution has been percolating for many many months, and even
years.
And suddenly, it began to grow.
[Indeed, a study of history shows over and
over that people don't realize how close they may be to a positive turning
point... if they just persist.]
And Honecker - who had been in ruling East Germany since the time of the
dinosaurs - sent down a paratroop division to Leipzig... and they wont
attack the demonstrators.
Its always when the foot soldiers of the elite wont carry out the forms of
draconian control that these dead regimes crumble.
And thats why its so important not to respond to police provocation.
No wonder veterans appear to have been targeted.
See
this and
this.
No wonder
returning veterans are treated as suspected
terrorists. No wonder images such as
this,
this and
this are so powerful.
