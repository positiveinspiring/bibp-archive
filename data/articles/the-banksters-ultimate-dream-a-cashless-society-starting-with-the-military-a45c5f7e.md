Why is a cashless society the holy grail of total tyrannical control for the
Banksters?
Because once your entire financial banking life
is under the dominion of these criminals in the form of a card or an
implanted chip, you will never again be free. They are
already tracking you, building a database
about you and monitoring your every move.
But once cash transactions are done away with
entirely, if the Banksters (or fascist government) dont like your point of
view or politics, they can just turn your chip off.
And no one may buy or sell except one who
has the mark or the name of the beast.
Its all part of the Rockefeller plan as
Hollywood producer
Aaron Russo warned.
We recently received this note about the U.S. militarys implementation of
the
Eagle cash card, a misnomer since theres
NO CASH involved. This is just another part of the slippery slope into a
100% fascist society, controlled by a tiny group of elite psychopaths.
Heres the note:
Hey SGT, I love your blog and read it every
day. I wanted to add something you may be missing. I am presently
working for the U.S. Military at a deployed location. Soldiers, Sailors,
Airman and Marines are already laying the groundwork for the Cashless
Society.
We are already using Chips, however, these
chips are Smart Cards with chips on them.
It is called the Eagle Cash
Card. As with most technology that the government employs, they are
trying it on the Department of Defense in areas not in plain site of
regular civilians.
The powers that be are very keen on using something
called Successive Approximation.
Basically, in layman terms Baby Steps. I
dont think they are going to the implants immediately (Its still to
Sci-Fi like for most people and too creepy for others). I truly believe
they are going to use Smart Cards first. They already are using them.
I know this because I have one and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
manages it.
We basically use it as anyone would use a
standard Credit Card, however, the funds come directly from our bank
accounts.
We can load funds on it and immediately use
it at every vendor. We can also transfer funds among each other (From
Soldier to Soldier). We just need to go to Eagle Cash machine to make
the transfer and/or check the balance.
Every time we make a purchase even if its a
50-cent pack of gum, we run the card. In fact, I havent seen a U.S.
dollar or any other currency other than the host nations in more than a
year. I have been using it for more than three years now at an
undisclosed location in the Middle East.
A quick search on the Internet and you will
find what I am saying is true or you can ask a returning Soldier,
Airman, Sailor or Marine and now a Contractor. Keep up the good work.
The name of the game is total control.
If you think the Banksters arent moving us toward a total-control grid
monetary nightmare at warp speed, check out the
Brunei-based Bank Islam Brunei Darussaloms new
biometric ATMs.
And please take special note of what appears to
be the numbers 666â€² in the banks logo. You just cant make this stuff up.
As weve long stated friends, at this point its
humanity VS. the Banksters.
