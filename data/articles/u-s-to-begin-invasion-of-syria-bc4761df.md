# U.S. to Begin Invasion of Syria

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_syria09.htm

Unbeknownst to the general public,
their elected politicians do not create the policy that binds
their national destiny domestically or within the arena of
geopolitics.
Instead, corporate-financier funded
think tanks do - teams of unelected policymakers which transcend
elections, and which produce papers that then become the
foundation of legislation rubber stamped by "legislators," as
well as the enumerated talking points repeated ad nauseam
by
the corporate-media.
Such a policy paper has been
recently written by the notorious US policy think-tank, the
Brookings Institution, titled, "Deconstructing
Syria: Towards a regionalized strategy for a confederal country."
The signed and dated open-conspiracy
to divide, destroy, then incrementally occupy a sovereign nation
thousands of miles from America's shores serves as a sobering
example of how dangerous and enduring modern imperialism is,
even in the 21st century.
Pretext ISIS
- US Poured Billions Into "Moderates" Who Don't Exist
The document openly admits that the
US has provided billions in arming and training militants fed
into the devastating and increasingly regional conflict.
It admits that the US maintains -
and should expand - operations in Jordan and NATO-member Turkey
to provide even more weapons, cash, and fighters to the already
catastrophic conflict.
It then recounts the rise of the
so-called "Islamic
State" (ISIS), but fails
to account from where its money, cash, and weapons came.
It should be obvious to readers that
if the United States has committed billions in cash, weapons,
and training on multiple fronts to alleged "moderates" who for
all intents and purposes do not exist on the battlefield, a
state-sponsor of greater magnitude would be required to create
and sustain ISIS and Al Qaeda's
Al Nusra Front who Brookings
admits dominates the "opposition" uncontested.
In reality,
ISIS' supply lines lead right into US
operational zones in Turkey and Jordan, because it
was ISIS and Al Qaeda all along that the West planned to use
before the 2011 conflict began, and has based its strategy on
ever since - including this most recent leg of the campaign.
The US Invasion
of Syria
After arming and funding a literal
region-wide army of Al Qaeda terrorists, the United States now
plans to use the resulting chaos to justify what it has sought
since the beginning of the conflict when it became clear the
Syrian government was not to capitulate or collapse - the
establishment of buffer zones now called "safe zones" by
Brookings.
These zones once created, will
include US armed forces on the ground, literally occupying
seized Syrian territory cleared by proxies including Kurdish
groups and bands of Al Qaeda fighters in the north, and foreign
terrorist militias operating along the Jordanian-Syrian border
in the south.
Brookings even admits that many of
these zones would be created by extremists, but that
"ideological purity" wound "no longer be quite as high of a
bar."
The US assumes that once this
territory is seized and US troops stationed there, the Syrian
Arab Army will not dare attack in fear of provoking a direct US
military response against Damascus.
The Brookings paper states:
The idea would be to help
moderate elements establish reliable safe zones within Syria
once they were able.
American, as well as Saudi and
Turkish and British and Jordanian and other Arab forces
would act in support, not only from the air but eventually
on the ground via the presence of special forces as well.
The approach would benefit from
Syria's open desert terrain which could allow creation of
buffer zones that could be monitored for possible signs of
enemy attack through a combination of technologies, patrols,
and other methods that outside special forces could help
Syrian local fighters set up.
Were Assad foolish enough to
challenge these zones, even if he somehow forced the
withdrawal of the outside special forces, he would be likely
to lose his air power in ensuing retaliatory strikes by
outside forces, depriving his military of one of its few
advantages over ISIL.
Thus, he would be unlikely to do
this.
In a single statement, Brookings
admits that the government of Syria is not engaged in a war
against its own people, but against "ISIL" (ISIS).
It is clear that Brookings,
politicians, and other strategists across the West are using the
threat of ISIS in combination with the threat of direct
military intervention as a means of leverage for finally
overrunning and seizing Syria entirely.
The Invasion
Could Succeed, But Not for US Proxies
The entire plan is predicated on
America's ability to first take and hold these "zones" and
subsequently mesh them into functioning autonomous regions.
Similar attempts at US "nation
building" are currently on display in the ravaged failed state
that used to be North Africa's nation of Libya, Syria's neighbor
to the southeast, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and the list goes
on extensively.
The folly of this plan both in
attempts to use non-existent credibility and military will to
actually implement it, as well as in terms of those foolish
enough to place their trust in a nation that has left a swath of
global destruction and failed states in its wake stretching from
South Vietnam to Libya and back again, can be described only as
monumental.
This strategy can almost certainly
be used to finally destroy Syria. It cannot however, be
used to do any of the things the US will promise in order to get
the various players necessary for it to succeed, to cooperate.
Almost certainly there are measures
Syria, its allies Iran and Hezbollah, as well as Russia, China,
and all other nations facing the threats of Western hegemony can
take to ensure that US forces will not be able to take and hold
Syrian territory or ultimately succeed in what is essentially
an invasion in slow motion.
Already the US has used their own
ISIS hordes as a pretext to operate militarily within Syrian
territory, which as predicted, has led to this next stage in
incremental invasion.
An increase in non-NATO peacekeeping
forces in Syria could ultimately unhinge Western plans
altogether.
The presence of Iranian, Lebanese,
Yemeni, Afghan, and other forces across Syria, particularly
bordering "zone" the US attempts to create, may offer the US the
prospect of a multinational confrontation it has neither the
political will, nor the resources to undertake.
The ability of Syria and its
allies to create a sufficient deterrence against US aggression
in Syria, while cutting off the logistical lines the US is using
to supply ISIS and other terrorist groups operating in Syria and
Iraq will ultimately determine Syria's survival.
