'On the Inside of Darkness'
November 12, 2013
When a US army drone got on the wrong side of the Iranian border a year or
two ago, some clever hackers found a way into its coded electronics and
guided it down to earth.
From there it was 'taken into custody' by
Iranian forces and subsequently taken apart - and a cloned version was
reverse engineered into existence. At least, that is what we are led to
believe.
This salutary tale provides us with an excellent template for the
deconstruction of
the Illuminati mind set and the
reversing of its malevolent Masonic ambitions.
Firstly though, we need to agree that there really is some form of 'master
plan' which guides the activities of those who are intent upon taking
control over of all arteries of human activity on this planet.
There is no lack of evidence pointing to the existence of a small
hierarchical cabal of rabid power brokers whose influence on the workings of
this planet far exceeds that of the main players in the typical competitive
fields of commerce and even politics. The origins of this cabal have been
traced to a small network of interlinked family blood lines going back to -
and beyond - the dominant fiefdoms of power once present in the citadels of
old Europe.
A
Black Nobility, as it was known, that asserts a direct hereditary line to
extra terrestrial 'gods' that came to this planet at least two
millennia ago
and set about dominating its development according to a darkly scripted and
distinctly sinister plan.
A line can be traced from that time right up to present day shadowy
'Godfather' figures - who stand behind all the major,
...industrial corporations of this decade.
Now, to understand the mechanics whereby this dark clan evolved its control
strategies, we have to enter its domain and have a look around inside.
This
exercise demands a surety of touch on the part of the infiltrator as well as
a well grounded sense of the inter-connective nature of the energies that
make up the total portrait of life, from the darkest to the lightest points
of the spectrum.
In this case, we are going to enter - and try to gain an understanding of -
the darkest end of the spectrum. This is the domain from which the
Illuminati entities draw their sustenance - and if we don't get a feel for
the way it works, we can't accomplish our mission.
We will travel a passage which directly connects the resonant light region
to the morphic dark region, using a vehicle - ourselves - which remains innerly illumined throughout.
So here we go
As we close-in on our destination, one of the first things that becomes
apparent is that the behavior of the entities who inhabit this place is
marked by a certain heaviness. Where there should be movement there is
instead stagnation. The entity we decide to observe is not motivated by
spontaneity of any description. To function, it appears to need very little
photon absorption; like fish living at the very bottom of the deep ocean.
An imploded vibrancy field draws upon low frequency carbon sources as a
sustaining factor, and an inverted auric field takes the form of a
microcosmic black hole, situated below the plexus.
To this is attracted all that has failed to utilize its life potential in
the outer world. Particularly in the human realm.
All that has made no
attempt to raise its consciousness and is therefore dependent upon the
distorted consumerist miasma of daily existence. This is the source of the
fuel that maintains the devouring nature of this perpetually hungry void.
As we move in closer, we can feel a certain numbness chilling the
atmosphere, a blanket which cuts off incoming vibratory waves that normally
interact with the inner sensitivities of conscious beings, forming the
staple ingredients of our awakened lives.
Penetrating further, we allow ourselves to absorb something of 'the state of
being' of this entity. This maneuver, which is not without danger, is a
prerequisite for our gaining a true understanding of the make up - the
composition - of that which we are exploring.
If we can't empathize with it - we can't influence it.
At the centre of this strangely void and dark interior where we now are, is
a sense of intense inward contraction. As though the entity is holding
something within a prison of privacy, power and protection. These 'emotions'
forming a neutron around which 'life' appears to revolve. This is a
polarized reverse gravitational field, the opposite to that of loving
sentient humans.
Now we must perform a little trick that will allow us to slip sideways
through the low vibrational plasmic field of this entity; turning ourselves
around on the inside so that we face the way we came in.
This is so as to
maintain 'the connect' with the cord of umbilical light that is accompanying
us at all times on this journey into the underworld.
We are performing the same role as
Theseus in the Minotaur's lair.
A line from the light resonance centre is our
golden thread which ensures the continuity of higher energy is never lost
while on this mission into darkness. It is only when we have arrived here -
on the inside of darkness - that we can start the process of reversing the
sequences that lie behind the destructive behavior patterns of Illuminati
initiates.
We are called upon to set in motion the transformation of the dark gravity
fields that have, up until now, been venomously sucking outside energies
into their mass, obscuring the inner source of sentient compassion so that
it can find no outward expression.
Now, if you have been able to follow me on this journey so far -
congratulations! Stick with it, for here comes the crucial, delicate part of
this operation that can set in motion a paradigm shift capable of bringing
light and balance back to a deeply disturbed internal and external order.
For the Illuminati mind is caught, mostly of it's own will, in an alien
world that reverses the normal sequence of events. Just as the Gestapo
Swastika is the reverse image of an ancient spiritual peace symbol - so the
ritualistic engagement in satanic worship in which the Illuminati
participate - reverses the positivity of loving emotion and hardens it into
an oppositional counterpart.
In consciously entering into this domain ourselves, we experience certain
patterns within this darkness that are familiar to us. That are part of our
emotional vocabulary.
Now this is a crucial discovery, as it means that we have penetrated a veil
within ourselves that has regarded, up until now, the dark motivation that
is characteristic of an Illuminati mind set - to be something wholly alien.
Something that we can conveniently place outside ourselves - something 'inhuman.
As we slowly gyrate around this strange and murky environment, like an
astronaut floating in outer space, we gradually detect just the tiniest ray
of pure light! It's the way that light is observed by deep sea explorers
peering out of their submersible's at great depths beneath the ocean's
surface.
This discovery is of profound significance because it reveals that a
'living' light element exists within the dark entity which must connect
right through to the opposite spectrum: the centre of light. A not well
understood truth that has come down to us from the great sages of the past.
Equally importantly, it reveals that the dark entities, so capable of
reeking havoc on our planetary existence, also have within themselves a
'divine spark' capable of transforming their crudeness - even if this spark
remains almost completely smothered by the entity's current extreme
opposition to its manifestation.
Gaining the sense of recognition that this state is common to both 'us' and
'them' opens up a valve within us that release a pheromone of compassion.
To exercise compassion
one
needs to be in
a position of strength (consciousness),
not slavery (ignorance).
This pheromone speaks to the little photon of
love that burns - up until now undetected - within the dark entity. So here
we are, camped on the inside of this dark hole - and yet able to feel a waft
of genuine compassion for its predicament!
Is such a thing possible?
Of course it is.
In the second that this 'reconnection' is established with the little photon
of light - a defining moment is catalyzed. A moment so profound that it
resembles the birth of the universe itself.
For it awakens the cellular tissues that lie dormant within the sleeping
sentient plain of the dark entity. Without this touch-paper having been
activated, we are unable to set in motion the operation that we have come
here to perform.
Once a human being - gifted as all are with divine powers to take control of
the greater destiny of this universe - crosses the Rubicon, and, keeping
his/her divine torch burning throughout, penetrates the greater darkness and
releases that which holds back its evolution into light - we will finally
have fulfilled the aspirations of the great legendary heroes - King Arthur,
Theseus, Orpheus, and all great mythic explorers of the underworld.
Once we have recognized and accepted that we too hold within our
compassion, the seed of darkness, the power of destruction, the capacity to
exert compassion-less will power, only then can we carry though the mission
that our Creator equipped us to perform.
So now, working from within this microcosmic black hole, the pheromone of
our compassion helps spark within this entity a little stirring - and that
stirring causes the entity to have a 'feeling' to which he/she is quite
unaccustomed, yet which acts like an ancient memory.
You see, somewhere deep inside, this entity knows that the light which
presently scares it is also its one chance for transformation and release.
Release from the cold vice-like clamp which seals the heart away from love -
the black hole that this entity has aligned itself with. A black hole whose
imploded gravitational field is maintained via vampiric sucking on the
innocent energies that can be enticed to offer themselves unto it.
And indeed, this is the horrific nature of,
...always
with the aim of maintaining power over others. An ambition which is born out
of a deep fear for the ways of truth.
As this activated photon vibration gets under way, its transformative
vibratory pulse opens into the light of day that which, for so long, has
festered on the bottom rung of cyclic decay.
Unlike the task given to St. George and and Theseus - it is not for us to 'slay the dragon' - but to help it to know that this is not its final form.
We are here to encourage that little spark of remaining light to expand and
to awaken the cellular tissues, so that they can ultimately metamorphose
this deathly entity into a being able to enter the higher planes of
existence. A process whereby its scaly old skin will simply fall away.
I think we all know that the 'us' and 'them' syndrome is essentially a kind
of stale mate that tends to further provoke aggressive tendencies by both
parties and never reaches an empowering or satisfactory conclusion. Yet it's
tortuously difficult to get beyond this state.
The breakthrough comes when we see that we are neither divisible nor
separate from those we oppose and who oppose us. And that, once whole, we
can embrace the darkness and the light and find pathways towards the
evolution and resolution of what otherwise appear to be irreversible and
unresolvable dichotomies.
It is therefore now possible to suggest that the dark side's attempts to
crush and obliterate the thinking, feeling inhabitants of planet Earth will
ultimately deny these destroyers the one means they have left to come alive
and be freed.
For there is no escaping the ubiquitous and loving photon power that casts
its ever broader beam over a wild yet waking world. And it is we - we human
beings - who have been entrusted by our Creator with bringing about this
task of transformation.
So that Illuminati - with nowhere left to hide - can
finally embark upon the genuine road of 'illumination' or be driven into
hiding ever deeper into still uncharted corners of this universe.
The ability to summon sufficient bravery to encourage the gift of light to
awaken in those who we have every reason to despise, is the next great
threshold in the evolution of awaking man.
Part 2
'Remember, you came here with a purpose'
November 25, 2013
In the first above essay under this title, we took a voyage into the heart of a
microcosmic 'black hole' in order to explore the inner workings of the
Illuminati mind set.
Once there, we entered into a process of
observation - while ensuring that our own state of being remained charged by
photon energy from the divine source.
We saw that at the heart of this black
hole was a darkly festering void made up of imploded and subsequently
reversed energies - behind which 'light' was trapped.
In deepening our penetration of this amorphous mass - and in allowing
ourselves to sample it's emotional condition - we discovered that elements
were familiar to us - and that it was not an entirely 'alien' state, but
recognizable as pertaining to various emotional plains experienced by us at
one time or another during our lives.
Recognizing this 'connect' made it possible to share an empathetic vibration
with this entity which, in turn, caused something to stir within its
sleeping cellular tissues. Something that made it possible for this entity
to experience a quite 'new' emotional message.
Thus, out of an act of spontaneous compassion, we were able to catalyze the
mythic process of 'reawakening' whereby a deeply embedded darkness can
ultimately metamorphose into an expression of higher light.
A dynamic 'quantum' principle that is not only
at work within the macrocosmic planes of our greater Universe, but within
each 'human' cell of our bodies.
Now, starting from a recognition that 'human' life is implicitly and
inherently interconnected with the greater life of our Universe, be it light
or dark, and that we 'humans' have within us the capacity to affect all life
at both the macro and microcosmic levels - we are going to join the inner to
the outer and the outer to the inner so that there are no more schisms and
divisions within what is fundamentally whole.
To do this, we will need to open ourselves to the 'outside' in exactly the
same way as we opened our selves to the 'inside' while exploring the dark
centre of an Illuminati entity.
The outside is the state of the World.
When witnessing the tragic state of humanity and the deep planetary wounds
resulting from its insentient worldly activities, we will - if we explore
honestly within - feel a deep sense of wrong. A kind of rebellious outrage.
A conviction that there is nothing remotely acceptable about this tragic
condition.
That it results from a largely self perpetuating
series of critical errors in the way we perceive and act out our lives. A
series of errors that are based upon ignoring our deepest intuitions and
allowing ourselves to be led by 'others.
These 'others' are those who blindly follow the
dictats of the status quo,
never seriously questioning its direction or motivation. A status quo, as we
have surmised, which is essentially a reflection of the perverse motivations
and ambitions of a dark cabal - and operates under its guidance. Those who
we refer to as 'the Illuminati.
It is this distorted enclave that ensures that the daily 'dumbing down'
prescriptions necessary for keeping humanity in a state of servitude are
kept on track - for their own deeply sinister ends.
It is nothing more or less than the expression
and realization of the reverse gravity psychology -
the Swastika deception -
which we witnessed on our mythic journey into its dark mass. It is this same
distortion that has brought us genetically modified food and all other forms
of reversed life 'progress' that manifest as the carcinogenic free radicals
of our daily lives.
Our journey inwards has shown that we are composed of the same universal
energies as those we oppose and which oppose us.
In recognizing this, we put a spotlight on our
own divisive tendencies to accuse and ridicule those who display negative
symptoms that are actually a mirror of those we have failed to challenge
within ourselves.
So our task here, is to set about wringing out the stagnant water from our
own polluted well. It's a big part of our life journey and demands an ever
watchful state; so that when the contradictory behavior manifests itself -
we can spot it at once - and thereby overcome it.
This inner cleansing process requires the channeling of our passionate,
creative energies, as much as any outgoing manifestation of our energies. It
is the same energy - that under our guidance is directed both ways at once -
rather than one way or the other.
Remember the tree! How it grows downwards
and upwards simultaneously, putting down roots and spreading great branches.
That's us.
The more we get the upper hand over our weaknesses - the more clearly do we
see how our 'civilization' is simply a reflection of the state of being of
we who inhabit planet Earth. It's a compound of unresolved emotional
conflicts and resolved emotional conflicts.
The more 'resolved' - the more the spirit is freed. The more 'unresolved'
the more trapped. The more the spirit is freed the greater our comprehension
of what it is that is blocking it's advancement in others.
Thus, our innate desire to ameliorate the lot of
mankind walks hand in hand with our own desire to realize our own powers. So
when we see that there is some force deliberately and steadfastly working
against this process of emancipation - we become 'fired-up' to prevent its
further progress and seek all ways in which to brake its grip on humanity.
Recognizing that we have left the daily workings of our planet in the hands
of that which is in essential opposition to the expansive spirit of
creativity and joy which forms the central thrust of our reason to be - is
the key imperative that must lead us to act.
Act to take back control over our destinies and
the destiny of this planet. In other words to become vigorously active in
opposing all that which is 'against life' and in standing and battling for
all that which is 'for life.
Now our inner passion for bringing about deeper change is directed outward
towards challenging all that impedes the same unfettered progress on the
surface.
This interprets as taking non violent direct action in whatever arena each
of us deems necessary and is most appropriate to our abilities and
motivations.
It means bringing forth the courageous within us and joining in
solidarity with others already dispensing with their comforts and risking
their lives for the greater good.
It means resistance, non compliance and civil disobedience - especially in
the face of attempts to force anti-life restrictions on our most basic
needs. It means not giving in to fear - and overcoming our narcissistic
tendencies for selfish self preservation.
For once we recognize that this
World is our garden we will start defending it in the same way as we defend
our own private place of subtlety and beauty.
There is no other way forward for us. For we are inherently motivated by a
fire of Divine origins which burns on the fuel of a passionate love that
knows no bounds. That force makes no distinction between inward spiritual
expression and outgoing inspired action - in defence of life (see "In
Defence of Life - a Radical Reworking of Green Wisdom").
It's a force that is all inclusive. It is omnipresent. It is in all of us.
It is us! It cannot be divided or denied if we human beings are intent upon
realizing that which we are. And the realization of that which we are is
achieved by facing the truth and acting upon it.
We cannot be realized human beings other than by
following this route. And it is by following this route that we gain the
powers and strengths that make it possible to heal even the deepest wounds
within ourselves, within others and within the torn tissues of this living
planet.
Remember, we came here with a purpose. It was not to take a back seat and
watch the madmen play out their vampiric fantasies. We came here to realize
a mission - to put ourselves on the line. And due to the severity of the
wounds perpetrated
here on Earth - a mission of heroic proportions.
Of winning back the health of our planet for the
furtherance of an extraordinary experiment that was initiated by our
Creator. Never allowing this grand experiment to be usurped and disfigured
by those in denial of their divine origins.
Some have already fulfilled (symbolically) the first phase of this mission.
Have seen and acted upon the knowledge that we are not separate from the
darkness that we once thought was entirely alien in nature.
We have seen the shadow of that darkness in
ourselves and have found that there is, within it, a photon of pure light.
We know that this light is of divine origin. That it comes from the centre
of all light.
We are no longer attempting to kill off that which impedes it - but to give
it motion into its next phase of evolution - out of its trapped state in
sterile darkness and into the movement and equilibrium of the outward
journey.
So it is that our fortitude can now build a bridge that spans the deliberate
and malevolent division of that which is in essence One.
Those who see themselves as on the path of
spiritual emancipation cannot advance any further accept by uniting with
those who make their first port of call confronting the oppressors and
destroyers of all that reflects the beauty and sanctity of life.
And so it
is, equally, for those activists who shirk the inner voyage that will
transform their flagging powers.
We will unite our energies - and this will be the act which finally changes
the course of history. It will herald a golden age of joyous outgoing
passion and creativity - poured into the crucial process of a deep cleansing
that will arouse the Gods and cause them to sing!
Rejoice in this task, for it is without doubt the reason for which we came
to this mysterious and wonderful place.
