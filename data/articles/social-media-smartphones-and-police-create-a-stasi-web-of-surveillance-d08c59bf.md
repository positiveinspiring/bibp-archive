Twitter has released a report confirming that
the U.S. government leads the world in requesting information on their
citizens. The
Transparency Report shows the U.S. government has made requests that are
infringing on American privacy rights.
Twitter
states that,
weve received more government requests in
the first half of 2012, as outlined in this initial dataset, than in the
entirety of 2011.
As the U.S. government sifts through the tweets
U.S.
citizens are making and analyzing information from illegal means, there are
decisions about particular citizens being made to justify the construction
of an all-encompassing Big Brother network.
Cloud computing is also under surveillance as
every conversation is recording and filed. While Microsoft denies this is
true, the adherence to their rules and regulations explains that all your
personal information is stored
within Skype.
In section 2 of their user
contract
explains:
Our primary purpose in collecting information is to provide
you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Skype
collects and uses, or has third party service providers acting on Skypes
behalf collecting and using, personal data relating to you, as permitted or
necessary to..."
The Department of Homeland Securitys Delaware
Information and Analysis Center (DIAC),
now offers a
mobile app to report suspicious activities in real-time by attaching a
photo, sending location information, or entering details about suspicious
vehicles or persons. In addition, users can choose to make their report
anonymously or can include contact information for follow-up by law
enforcement.
The
Anti-Terrorism Mobile FORCE 1-2 App is designed for iPhone and Android
users that create spies out of average citizens for the sake of the State.
The information collected by users is funneled to a National Security Agency
(NSA)
Fusion Center to be disseminated with federal agencies and local law
enforcement.
Using terrorism and 9/11 phone calls as a
fear-mongering campaign to coerce the general public into participating in
this new Stasi, the
Delaware government hopes to keep its citizens,
ever vigilant in the
fight against terrorism and this new app is just one way for our citizens to
help.
Simultaneously,
Symantecs Norton Cybercrime Report states that cybercrimes involving
smartphones are costing consumers $110 billion annually as these thieves
peruse mobile devices and social networks looking for loopholes.
Smartphones
are sent fake bills which add to the telecommunications services and rack-up
charges as well as implant viruses into devices through apps.
Infected phones infect other phones through
sending of information, text messages and emails. Nameless, faceless hackers
change segments of code and inject the malware into the smartphone. However,
most mobile phone and telecommunications corporations still maintain that
mobile applications are safe and there should be no precautions taken when
downloading these apps.
The
CIA-sponsored AntiSec hacker group was
successful in stealing millions of ID numbers from Apple, Inc. from
databases where the corporation had been storing user personal data. They
then leaked this information out for the general public to see.
However this
action serves another purpose.
The FBI was also
infiltrated by the same state-controlled hacker group wherein a laptop
was,
compromised and private data regarding Apple UDIDs was exposed. At this
time, there is no evidence indicating that an FBI laptop was compromised or
that the FBI either sought or obtained this data.
The bureaus press office
later posted on its Twitter account that it never had the information in
question and that the reports its laptop was hacked were totally false.
While data mining, cell phone corporations are
using mobile phone habits to decipher the predictive movements of users.
Scientists from the University of Birmingham in the UK have
revealed that they can predict the movements of mobile phone users
through tracking the network usage in real time with algorithms that
forecast probabilities. This means that cell phone corporations, if using
this system could predict the future whereabouts of their customers at any
time of the day or night.
As our cell phone become weapons of mass
surveillance, police departments across the nation are installing more CCTV
cameras to better spy on citizens. In Maryland, local police have been using
speed cameras at intersections to watch citizens under the guise of
mitigating damages caused by car accidents.
Researchers for the Defense Department have
created working
prototypes of bi-static radar that can utilize WiFi to spy on citizens
through walls. In tests, a one foot think brick wall was used and the
monitoring radar could send back visual data to be interpreted.
WiFi signals can be extended and are available
virtually everywhere which makes the capability of transmitting information
easier with radio signals and laptops.
With the siphoning of information from a
wireless router, surveillance software can be used as well to see through
walls.
A persons whereabouts can be correctly pinpointed by using WiFi
signals that bounce off objects which can decipher speed, location and
direction of an individual.
Justification for this technology is
surmised as:
See Through The Wall (STTW) technologies are of great
interest to law enforcement and military agencies; this particular device
has the UK Military of Defense exploring whether it might be used in urban
warfare, for scanning buildings.
Other more benign applications might range
from monitoring children to monitoring the elderly.
These surveillance grids are being implemented
to compliment the
State and Local Anti-Terrorism Traning (SLATT) program that defines for
police departments what an extremist is and how to,
recognize and report
indicators of terrorism/criminal extremism.
The SLATTs definition of terrorism is vague and
broad.
It encompasses,
the unlawful use of force or violence against persons
or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population,
or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.
While terrorism is meant to intimidate and coerce a population into
submission, the local law enforcement is employed to play an integral part
in bringing intelligence to the federal agencies and international
intelligence communities involved with hindering terrorism.
The SLATT explains that those who use cash, stay
in tight-knit groups, repeatedly use the word God, carry video or
observation equipment and have hand-drawn maps are terrorists.
The document goes on to explain that any type of
surveillance that is not state-sponsored is terroristic in nature and should
be reported.
