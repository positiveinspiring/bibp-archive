War Criminal Henry Kissinger
Within days of September 11, 2001,
Henry
Kissinger, former US Secretary of State, made a proposal that
would have really changed everything forever.
In a nationally syndicated Op Ed, entitled Destroy the Terrorists Network
he wrote that the attack,
which is a threat to our social way of
life... has to be dealt with (by) an attack on the system that produces
it.
He also wrote that the US government,
should be charged with a systematic
response that... will end with the destruction of the system that is
responsible for it.
In a May 2012 television interview, current
Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, admitted for the first time that
the US had created Al Qaeda in the late 1970s and funded its participation
in the war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.
We had helped to create the problem that we
are now fighting, Ms. Clinton said. The people we are fighting today,
we were supporting when we were fighting the Soviets.

President
Barak Obama and his predecessor
George
W. Bush have both made amply clear that the war on terror includes any
persons, groups or states that give material or financial assistance to
terrorist organizations.
Anyone doubting that Dr. Kissinger was not
cognizant, in 2001, that the Al Qaeda network had been founded and funded by
his own government, should recall that his protégé, National Security
Advisor under President Carter,
Zbigniew Brzezinski, was famously
photographed in Pakistan in the early 1980s eyeing the barrel of a gun that
the US government had supplied to Al Qaeda and to its leader who was
standing in the photo beside him -
Osama bin Laden:
Though Dr. Kissinger was out of office at that
time, could he have retained his credentials as perennial advisor to
American Presidents without maintaining his cognizance of such complex
events?
Why then would Dr. Kissinger have openly proposed an attack on the very
state that he himself has so faithfully served throughout his entire
political career and have felt immune from charges of treason or of being a
terrorist himself for doing so?
Ms. Clinton gives us a clue about this apparent psychopathic thinking.
In a
February 2012 BBC interview, Clinton stated, regarding the Obama
administrations handling of the armed insurrection against the Syrian
government,
I would not be doing my job if I were not
looking at the complexity
Clearly I know how complex this is.
Here, she extols her competence that mere
mortals do not possess.
What makes her job so complex, of course, is the
need to figure out how to publicly stage-manage the events that her
government has created and through its media is manipulating to its
geo-strategic benefit, all the while giving the appearance of innocently
spreading freedom and democracy to unenlightened natives.
We were successful, said Ms. Clinton in
her May 2012 Al Qaeda interview.
The Soviets left Afghanistan and we said Great,
goodbye leaving these trained people who were fanatical
well armed,
creating a mess, frankly, that at the time we didn't really recognize... we
just thought, ok fine, we're ok now. Everything's going to be so much
better.
Unfortunately, the Secretary of State was not quoting the remarks of a
teenage girl at a community college debating society, for here she is
portraying her government, and by extension herself, as an innocent caught
in the snares of an evil and dangerous world.
Still, Ms. Clinton is quite correct in that
everything is so much better, not to mention so much more profitable, for
those who can create the mess, spin its deadly aftermath and then be
heralded by the public for, among other statesmanlike qualities, the
complexity of their thought.
There has been some media dialogue of late about what is apparently the
psychopathic behavior of Wall Street speculators and the incalculable damage
they laughingly do to American society. Such a dialogue is long in coming
and should be extended to the advocates of the war against terror.
Since last year, it has been publicly known that the
U.S. and NATO supported
and financed Al Qaeda groups in Libya in their mutually planned overthrow of
the Qadaffi government.
These same terrorist groups had earlier fought in
Iraq where they committed terrorist actions fighting against the occupying
U.S. military.
It is now known that, following the Libyan
rebellion, that those same fighters were shipped to NATO funded bases in
Turkey and there trained to fight in the bloody insurrection against the
Syrian government. How many of the atrocities committed against the Syrian
people have been committed by those terrorist fighters is never touched upon
by the media.
This allows the Obama administration to posture
about its concern for Syrian civilians while planning for them the same fate
that Libyan, Iraqi and Afghan civilians are now enduring.
The medias ignoring of these known facts about Al Qaeda allows the American
public to avoid confronting two fundamental questions:
-
If the U.S. is committed to destroying
Al Qaeda, why hasnt it been providing assistance to the governments
attacked by it - Libya and Syria?
-
And, if the U.S. were actually at war
against terrorism and Al Qaeda, why isnt it, as Dr. Kissinger
suggested, attacking elements of itself and NATO in order to destroy
those responsible for the terrorists actions?
In the upside-down world that war on terror
advocates live in (and expect the rest of us to accept as reality) the Al
Qaeda fighters who fought in Afghanistan against the Evil Empire (the
Russian one, that is) were good, but then became bad shortly before
September 11 and afterwards needed to be destroyed.
Then, in the middle of their multiple and
barbaric terrorist activities around the world, they suddenly become good
enough to qualify for financial and logistical support in supporting the
U.S. NATO and Israel in their colonial conquests of the remaining
non-obsequious Arab governments.
The eventual fate of these Al Qaeda fighters is of as little concern to
their Western paymasters as is the fate of its taxpaying citizens living,
willingly or not, in this upside-down world created by those managing its
complexity. The U.S. government was, and is, an intrinsic and essential part
of the terrorist network, which could not exist without its connivance and
which would not fight without being paid by the direct approval of the U.S.
Unbelievable?
Well how else to explain why Kissinger has not written an Op
Ed advocating the destruction of the Saudi regime and why the U.S. has not
attacked it for being material and financial supporters of those groups?
Dr. Kissingers treasonable and terroristic suggestion made so soon after
the horror of September 11 would come as no surprise to police
investigators.
They often say about criminals - Something in them wants to be found out,
and caught. A religious believer would say that their soul is crying out to
be saved. With the current crop of apparently soul-dead American leaders,
who can know?
-
Former President Bushs checking under a table
in response to a reporters question about the never located Iraqi weapons
of mass destruction
-
President Obamas joke about ordering a drone attack on
a White House reporter
-
Ms. Clintons laughing remarks about the killing
of Qadaffi We came, we saw, he died! open a dark window on the conscience
of all too many American leaders:
How many normal people are able to understand the complexity of creating the
appearance of talking peace while creating mayhem, and receiving a hefty
paycheck from the citizens they have sworn to serve while doing so?
They are laughing at us. Not just the Al Qaeda leaders who see the U.S. as
destroying itself from within, as Osama bin Laden claimed it would. Worse,
it is our own leaders who are snickering at us.
While they make their jokes and pontificate as
peacemakers, they are laughing at us.
We just thought, ok fine, we're ok now.
Everything is going to be so much better.
Our leaders know us the way they know
themselves.
They love to feel in control while they are
being manipulated. Stock market frauds. Gambling casinos. Pornography.
Drugs. Psychotropics. Ha Ha Ha! We are good and innocent and we are helping
people to be free like us.
Ha Ha Ha! They love to be manipulated, just like
we do.
Any government that shelters
groups
involved in the attack, must pay an exorbitant price Kissinger
wrote in his 2001 Op Ed.
Who can deny that average Americans have not
been doing so?
But not only materially in their lost homes,
their lost jobs, their lost savings. Also, and perhaps most importantly for
the future of American society, in the price Americans are paying for their
lost capacity to recognize liars and their bullshit and to call them out by
their names.
