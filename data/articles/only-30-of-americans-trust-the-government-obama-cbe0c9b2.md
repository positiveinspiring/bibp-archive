Corruption, Crony Capitalism and Trampling on
the Bill of Rights Lead to Widespread Distrust
Trust in government has plummeted
due to institutional corruption.
And
see this.
More and more Americans realize that the
government has
bailed out the super-elite of the big banks, and
enabled their fraud
while
hosing the little guy
again and
again (and
again).
People see that we have
socialism for the rich, but cut-throat, sink-or-swim
capitalism for everyone else. They see that we have a malignant
synergism between D.C. politicians and giant companies.
Look
here,
here,
here.
At the same time, the government
spies on virtually all Americans, and has threatened to
assassinate or
indefinitely detain American citizens on U.S. soil.
Folks are starting to wake up to the fact that
Obama is a lot like Bush.
Indeed, hes
continued many of the horrible Bush programs he promised to stop, covered up
for Cheney and company, and
allowed even worse inequality and trampling of the Constitution.
So people are starting to see that the
mainstream Republican and Democratic parties are
virtually identical regarding
core issues including:
And that any apparent difference is just a
scripted show.
No wonder a new poll by Pew shows that
only 3 in 10 Americans trust our government:
For the past seven years, a period covering
the final two years of the Bush administration and President Obamas
first term, no more than about three-in-ten Americans have said they
trust the federal government to do the right thing always or most of the
time.
Our
Jan. 2013 survey found only 26% saying they can trust government
always or most of the time, while 73% say they can trust the government
only some of the time or never. Majorities across all partisan and
demographic groups express little or no trust in government
As CBS news
notes:
The Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C.
has found that fewer Americans than ever trust the decisions made by the
government.
Indeed, we noted in February that
more and more Americans see the government as a threat, rather
than a protector:
For years, conservative pollsters have
said that Americans are furious at the government:
Liberals may be tempted to think that this
is a slanted perspective. But non-partisan and liberal pollsters are
saying the same thing:
The latest national survey by the Pew
Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted Jan. 9-13
among 1,502 adults,
finds that 53%
think that the federal government threatens their own personal
rights and freedoms while 43% disagree.
In March 2010, opinions were divided
over whether the government represented a threat to personal
freedom; 47% said it did while 50% disagreed.
In surveys between
1995 and 2003, majorities rejected the idea that the government
threatened peoples rights and freedoms.

The survey finds continued widespread
distrust in government.
About a quarter of Americans (26%) trust the
government in Washington to do the right thing just about always or
most of the time; 73% say they can trust the government only some of
the time or volunteer that they can never trust the government.
***
Majorities across all partisan and
demographic groups express little or no trust in government.
Obviously, Democrats are currently more
trusting in government than Republicans.
For example:
The Pew Research Centers 2010 study of
attitudes toward government found that, since the 1950s, the party
in control of the White House has expressed more trust in government
than the so-called out party.
But given that even a growing percentage of
Dems believe that government is a threat to their freedom, things are
indeed getting interesting
