Germany is withdrawing gold deposits
in US and France back to Germany
For some reason, the first week of January 2013
saw a large withdrawal of deposits from US banks, the largest since the 9/11
terrorist attacks.
As reported in
Russia Today, the US Federal Reserve saw $114 billion withdrawn from 25
of the US's largest banks in the first week of January 2013.
The reason for this spike in withdrawals is not
clear. Some analysts believe that it could be because the Transaction
Account Guarantee insurance program ended Dec. 31, 2012 and therefore people
are withdrawing money that is no longer insured.
The insurance program had been introduced during
the 2008 crisis to support the banking system. It provided insurance for
about $1.5 trillion in non-interest bearing accounts, but the limit of
insurance for any account was set at $250,000. Small and medium-sized banks
were targeted by the program as they were thought less able to weather the
crisis than larger banks.
However, what surprised analysts is that the
withdrawals are from larger banks that were considered safe.
Expectations were for depositors in small and
medium banks to put their deposits in the bigger banks when the insurance
program ended. Some think that the withdrawals simply reflect the fact that
money is often needed at the beginning of the year for various purposes.
Other analysts think that money is taken out to be invested as the economic
outlook improves somewhat.
Other data suggests that some money is just
being moved from one type of account to another.
Most other reports on this issue rely on the
Russia Today article. Unfortunately it has no link to the Federal Reserve
Data that it uses in its report. However, I did find another report in the
Washington Times.
The Times report indicates that the withdrawals
represented 2 percent of deposits in the 25 largest US banks. The end of the
TAG insurance program was expected to create a run on smaller banks but they
lost far less than the large banks, at just 0.9 percent of their deposits.
Last year, in May, a survey was
carried out of searches for "bank runs."
The number of searches by Americans set a record
high then. However, the data also reveal that among countries US searchers
only came third after people from Singapore and Hong Kong. Greece came in
fourth. The Greeks were too busy withdrawing money from banks to search for
"bank runs."
As the appended below video shows, there was
also a bit of a run on gold this month too, as Germany sought to repatriate
gold held elsewhere. One would think gold would be going up as well, but
that is not happening yet.
THE RUN ON "PHYSICAL" GOLD HAS ALREADY BEGAN TOO!
China is making an even
bigger move toward gold in reaction to money printing
around the world...
People's Bank of China official Zhang Jianhua declared:
"No asset is safe now.
The only choice to hedge risks is to hold hard
currency - gold".
Zhang, the bank's research
director, recommended buying the dips:
"The Chinese government
should not only be cautious of the imported risk
caused by rising global inflation, but also further
optimize its foreign-exchange portfolio and purchase
gold assets when the gold price shows a favorable
fluctuation".
China's $3.2 trillion in
foreign reserves are currently invested one-third in
U.S. treasuries 20 percent in euro-denominated assets
and only 1.8 percent in gold, according to China Daily.
China has one of the world's
biggest gold reserves at least at 1,000 tons...
