We do not have a debt crisis.
We have a crisis in our dependence on
two corrupted political parties, each paid
to perpetuate a mass extraction on behalf of those that finance them in
unique and sordid ways.
America has a crisis in the way that our
government has institutionalized extractive banking, trade, tax, energy,
education, and health systems from coast-to-coast. It is so apparent that it
was the underlying premise for my book
Greedy Bastards.
The political parties, their methods and those
who finance them are the root of the problem. And our government perpetuates
these systems because our political "leaders" are directly dependent on the
few economic beneficiaries of these grossly misaligned systems.
What is commonly referred to as debt is, in
reality, what we must pay for the extraction in health or banking or the tax
code. This is merely a symptom of the extraction.
As I described in Greedy Bastards, we
are surrounded by unprecedented new methods all made unique by an ability to
provide abundance of health or learning or other core resources for relative
pennies. Look no further than people like
Sal
Kahn in education, or
Jeffrey Brenner in health care, or
Colin
Archipley and his hydroponic farming methods.
The consolidated resources of political parties
was likely necessary in 1890, when broad communication was nearly impossible
for any given candidate.
But today,
-
What is to stop five or ten political
aspirants from running in open primaries using transparent
financing, absent any political party whatsoever?
-
What indeed, other than blatant
stonewalling and subterfuge by the men and women of our two dominant
parties who have established a ruling class in a nation that
certainly doesn't want one and absolutely doesn't need one?
Until reforms like transparent financing and
open primaries are implemented, however, we are left with two choices.
One is to wallow in the tragedy of the
dysfunction, which too many of us are selecting. Two, we can choose to
embrace the amazing methods blossoming around us outside of the mainstream
system.
These methods hold the promise of converting
buildings to become energy positive batteries in a distributed power grid.
Or to supply abundant food with the absolute minimum amount of water. Or
widespread education for pennies.
I have always believed that the size of the
problem equals the size of the opportunity. And considering the obvious size
of the problem presented by opaque election financing and extractive core
systems, massive opportunities for reform surely surround us.
For me, finding those opportunities begins with
deciding what I can do each day to move the ball forward. Setting my intent
to shape what is directly in front of me creates the ability to reject
political parties altogether.
And until I hear discussion of open primaries
and transparent election finance, I will remain deaf to the siren's call of
political party-bound screeds luring our nation toward dangerous straits.
P.S.
Look at
what's making the rounds again.
It's sad to
think this rant is as relevant in 2013 as it was in 2011.
