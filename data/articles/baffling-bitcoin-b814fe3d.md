Bitcoin,
the revolutionary cyber currency, continues to make
waves. Its exchange rate is appreciating rapidly and it
is discussed at many forums.
While its escalating price
is attractive, it is also symptom of its main weakness.
But it got people thinking
in a major way and as such it is already an
unforgettable success.
Heres the story of
Zach Harvey and Matt Whitlock,
the young guns behind the latest innovation:
a Bitcoin
ATM, allowing people to pay with the in
stores, restaurants and other real world outlets. Its an important
step forward.
To find wide acceptance, free market currencies
need to allow both banking style on-line transactions (mainly for Business
to Business transactions) and a more direct mode of payment for Business to
Consumer deals.
This ATM device allows B2C transactions in a
modern and convenient way and certainly has the potential to greatly impact
Bitcoins exposure and reach.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is heavily discussed on all
kinds of forums. The general trend seems to be that people more and more
appreciate the idea of free market competition in currency. There are some
very unfair critiques also, for instance from
anarcho-capitalist outlet the Daily Bell.
One would expect from them more than anybody
else to endorse free market innovations, but since it is not Gold, it does
not fit in their quaint notions on money. According to them the fact that
Bitcoin transactions are logged and are thus traceable is probably the real
agenda behind them. They seem to assume we will pay only with coin once
nature has run its course.
But this is nonsense, of course, we cant do
without solid on-line transactions in the modern age, not for the time being
anyway.
Logging is implicit in on-line banking-style
transactions. The problem is not logging, but who is doing the logging and
what is he doing with it. There are privacy concerns, and well see if and
how the market solves them, but we cannot blame such a revolutionary
initiative for not being perfect from day one.
Certainly, a new currency, not centrally
controlled by tPtB, a volume far less easily manipulable, showing the free
market way, is a step forward.
The fact that 1 Bitcoin is now selling at 30
dollars is quite something: back in November 2011 its price stood at 6 and
its hard to think of an asset doing better. However, basically this is
Bitcoins main problem.
As we discussed earlier,
Bitcoin is built on the premise that loss of value (inflation) is the main
problem with our money. It is not. Scarcity, deflation and usury are our
main problems and although Ive not yet heard of Bitcoin banking
initiatives, unavoidably associated with usurious lending, it is only a
matter of time.
Bitcoins high price and continuing quick
appreciation is a very solid indicator that there are not enough in
circulation: demand outstrips supply and this will not change. It is also
starting to look vulnerable to speculation and market manipulation.
Furthermore, because it is so incredibly
lucrative to hold them, people will much prefer to pay with dollars, except
for the curiosity effect of paying with Bitcoin. This hoarding aggravates an
already deflationary scenario and is very similar to the deflationary
depression that we are facing today in the wider economy.
There is also
the bizarre story of the CIAs not for
profit investment arm (whatever that may mean) IN-Q-TEL eying Bitcoin for
investment.
However, Bitcoin was designed to allow many
different parameters. Different versions of it can be designed, with quite
different basic rules and there are several spin-offs in development.
One of these
is
Freicoin, which was recently released and which comes along with
a demurrage: a negative interest rate, charging the holders of money,
instead of the borrowers. This promotes spending the money and ends
hoarding. People tend to pay as quickly as possible to avoid the, typically
about 6% per year, fine.
The legendary Wörgl, operational in 1934 Austria during the darkest days
of the Great Depression, is the most famous example of a
demurrage currency. Most German
regional currencies are equipped with it too.
In Wörgl it ended unemployment within a year and
public works were renewing the whole place while the rest of Europe
languished. It was so successful, the Austrian Central Bank panicked and
closed it down and threatened with a military invasion when the natives got
angry. Even today, the basic laws that govern banking in Euroland are
explicitly formulated in such a way as to make the basic Wörgl design
impossible.
Freicoins demurrage will probably solve
Bitcoins main weakness. It will be interesting to see how it will perform
in comparison to Bitcoin. Marketing is very important to unlock its
potential.
Conclusion
Abundant, interest-free, free market units, perhaps like Freicoin, are more
likely to really threaten the Money Powers stranglehold over our money
supply. But Bitcoin definitely is a major step forward and eye-opening for
millions of people.
It is a great inspiration for all monetary
reformers out there.
