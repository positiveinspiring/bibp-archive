# We Just DonÂ’t Trust You - Note to President Obama

Last month at Ohio State
Universitys commencement, President
Obama held forth on the
issue of trust in government.
Youve grown up hearing voices
that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than
some separate, sinister entity, he told the new graduates.
Theyll warn that tyranny is
always lurking just around the corner. You should reject
these voices. Because what they suggest is that our brave,
and creative, and unique experiment in self-rule is somehow
just a sham with which we cant be trusted.
Given the revelations in recent days
and weeks of his administrations illicit and undercover
activities, Mr. Obamas trust speech should go down in the
history of irony.
The National Security Agencys
(NSA)
top secret Prism program, which was exposed this
week, illustrates why people distrust government.
The scope of NSA collection is
breathtaking. It does not simply target phone call metadata,
which is bad enough. It has indiscriminately sucked up emails,
chats, videos, photos, stored data, file transfers, video
conferencing, login activity, online social networking details
and special requests whatever they are.
And the collection effort is not
limited to Verizon, but also involves,
As many as 50 companies, ISPs, and
credit agencies now have their records - which is to say, your
records - in secret government databases.
Distrust of government was a
majority opinion well before the recent scandal outbreaks. A
January 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center found that
53% believed - correctly it turns out - that the
federal government threatens their
personal rights and freedoms.
A Gallup survey from 2011 found that
when asked if the biggest threat to the country in the future
was big business, big labor or big government, the state was
cited by 64%. Again, correct answer.
Director of National Intelligence
James Clapper defends Prism and other such projects as
necessary wartime tools, even as Mr. Obama has said
the war on terrorism is 'over.'
Clapper and others claim that the
system has saved the country from 'devastating' terror attacks.
Well,
maybe so, or maybe not.
Lacking details the public has no
way of knowing. We do know that the Boston bombers were able
successfully to execute their attack on the United States even
though the intelligence community had been given explicit
warnings about them by both the Russian and Saudi Arabian
intelligence services.
If Prism was used to track the
Tsarnaev Brothers, it failed. If not, why have it?
Mr. Clapper and others claim the
system is legal under the Patriot Act. But Rep. James
Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.), one of the principle authors of the
law, believes that it was
never intended to allow government
surveillance of this breathtaking scope.
Furthermore, we cannot take the word
of a self-interested government on the legality of its own
questionable activities. The Obama administration has taken a
particularly cavalier approach to due process rights. It
resisted having to justify targeted assassination of Americans
abroad, and when the White House finally claimed a
Constitutional rationale, it said the argument was classified.
The Justice Department has
repeatedly sought to have
Google hand over user data
without warrants, moving from judge to judge seeking a favorable
ruling. This judge shopping technique is endemic.
Attorney General Eric Holder
had to try three judges before he found one willing to let
him seize James Rosens emails and phone logs. That
proceeding was kept secret as well.
And when secret courts make secret
rulings against the government, the Justice Department (DoJ)
strives to keep these decisions under
wraps too.
Mr. Obama expects the American
people to take 'his word' that this massive trove of private
information in the hands of the government has never been
misused, while at the same time his administration is in the
throes of scandals at the IRS and Justice Department
centered around the abuse of such information.
