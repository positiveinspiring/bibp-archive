"Tell Them It's the Sound of Freedom."
General Mark Kimmitt's
Easter Day Mistruths
"We gather tonight knowing that this
generation of heroes
has made the United States
'safer' and more 'respected' round the world."
President Barack Obama
State of the Union address, 24th
January 2012
As Easter was celebrated in the US and UK with, for believers, the message
of hope, Fallujah, the region and much of the country is again under siege,
not this time by US mass murderers, but by the US proxy government's
militias armed with US delivered weapons.
In 2003, a month into the invasion, Easter Day fell on the same day as this
year, 20th April, as Iraqis of all denominations and none,
died were incarcerated, tortured, found with their heads drilled, or no
heads, thrown on garbage piles.
Easter Day the following year, 2004 fell on Sunday 11th
April and was marked by Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt confirming
again his total disregard for human life.
In the words of former
USCENTCOM Commander General Tommy Franks
who led the Iraq invasion in March 2003,
"it is not productive to count Iraqi
deaths".
The carnage of the first siege of Fallujah was
underway.
At the daily press briefing (1)
General Kimmitt assured the media:
"The Marines remain ready, willing and able
at any time to provide any level of humanitarian assistance.
"Outside the city of Fallujah, I understand they've already set up
facilities for any displaced persons that come out of the city that need
assistance.
"That is something that the Marine Corps is expert in, the whole notion
of assistance, rendering assistance to any town in the world at
anytime."
Then as now, it is impossible to know whether to
laugh or weep.
General Kimmitt. was then asked:
"From here, from this podium, you talk about
a clean war in Fallujah. But the Iraqis have an image through television
from what is happening in Fallujah (including) killing children. Is
there a way that you could convince Iraqis by your point of view that
you have (only) utilized force against terrorists?"
With his hallmark contempt for humanity, or
anything to do with "rendering assistance", he replied:
"With regards to the solution on the images
of Americans and coalition soldiers killing innocent civilians, my
solution is quite simple: change the channel. Change the channel to a
legitimate, authoritative, honest news station.
"The stations that are showing Americans intentionally killing women and
children are not legitimate news sources. That is propaganda, and that
is lies. So you want a solution? Change the channel."
Jonathan Steel of the Guardian persisted:
"General Kimmitt, you talk about changing
channels, but what is your reply to people like (politician) Adnan
Pachachi, who have accused the coalition forces of using collective
punishment on the city of Fallujah? Have you got a reply a little bit
more nuanced and subtle than just to tell Mr. Pachachi to change
channels?"
Without shame, the General responded to the
situation in the town which has become known as "Iraq's Guernica" with:
"In this case, we can disagree without being
disagreeable, but it is not the practice of the coalition forces, any of
the coalition nations, to exercise collective punishment or collective
action on a city.
That is just not done. It is not practiced.
And it violates international law. And we don't believe at this point
that coalition can be shown any proof to suggest that it is in violation
of international law or the laws of land warfare."
The town was in fact, treated as a "free fire
zone", two hospitals were demolished including a recently built emergency
centre and at the General Hospital, patients and doctors were initially
handcuffed, the "liberators' regarding it as "a centre of propaganda", since
the staff talked, then as now, of the numbers of dead and wounded they were
treating.
The "non-American wounded were, in essence left
to die", as a result.
A comment from one as either deluded or unfamiliar with the truth as General
Kimmitt, a Lt-Col Pete Newell, stated that US Forces wanted:
" Fallujah to understand what democracy is
all about."
Colonel Ralph Peters, ever in pursuit of his
vision of eternal war, said of this vision of democracy.
"We must not be afraid to make an example of
Fallujah. We need to demonstrate that the United States military cannot
be deterred or defeated.
If that means widespread destruction, we
must accept the price... Even if Fallujah has to go the way of Carthage,
reduced to shards, the price will be worth it." (2)
Now it is known definitively what a pack of lies
were Kimmitt's assurances, with the General having confirmed his knowledge
of violations of international law - even before the second decimation of
Fallujah later in the year, perhaps someone should surely visit him and
Colonel Peters with a view to including them in an upcoming historic class
action law suit which has been filed in the US. (3)
Less than a month after Kimmitt's channel changing advice, General Taguba
released his Report on what "democracy was all about" at the hands of the US
military at Abu Ghraib prison, a short distance from Fallujah.
It still chills and should shame for all time.
Just a few of his findings include:
"
that the intentional abuse of detainees by
military police personnel included the following acts:
-
Punching, slapping, and kicking
detainees; jumping on their naked feet.
-
Videotaping and photographing naked male
and female detainees
-
Forcibly arranging detainees in various
sexually explicit positions for photographing
-
Forcing detainees to remove their
clothing and keeping them naked for several days at a time
-
Forcing naked male detainees to wear
women's underwear
-
Forcing groups of male detainees to
masturbate themselves while being photographed and videotaped
-
Arranging naked male detainees in a pile
and then jumping on them *Positioning a naked detainee on a MRE Box,
with a sandbag on his head, and attaching wires to his fingers,
toes, and penis to simulate electric torture
-
Writing "I am a Rapest" (sic) on the leg
of a detainee alleged to have forcibly raped a 15-year old fellow
detainee, and then photographing him naked
-
Placing a dog chain or strap around a
naked detainee's neck and having a female Soldier pose for a picture
-
A male MP guard having sex with a female
detainee
-
Taking photographs of dead Iraqi
detainees
-
Breaking chemical lights and pouring the
phosphoric liquid on detainees
-
Threatening detainees with a charged 9mm
pistol
-
Pouring cold water on naked detainees
-
Beating detainees with a broom handle
and a chair
-
Threatening male detainees with rape
-
Allowing a military police guard to
stitch the wound of a detainee who was injured after being slammed
against the wall in his cell
-
Sodomizing a detainee with a chemical
light and perhaps a broom stick
-
Using military working dogs to frighten
and intimidate detainees with threats of attack, and in one instance
actually biting a detainee". (4)
Did the General not know of what was happening
at the hands of US troops throughout the region?
His knowledge of Iraq, however, was such that in
the press conference cited above, he referred to Baghdad, of which
journalists, he thought, would be "familiar", as a "town", this ancientest
city of seven million people.
Baghdad, formerly, as Kurt Nimmo writes, the most advanced city in
the Middle East, has now been designated in a recent survey (5)
the world's worst city:
"a dangerous ruin, stricken by sectarian and
religious violence, corruption, crime, unemployment, pollution and
numerous other problems."
Mark Kimmitt is now retired and "is an
advisor to US firms in the Middle East" (6) presumably
profiting from US destabilization and industrial scale murder and
destruction, ongoing in Iraq, after eleven years, at an average of one
thousand souls a month.
It has to be wondered if, on the tenth anniversary of his massive Easter Day
mistruths, he reflected on his words, Iraq's ongoing carnage - and that when
a journalist had asked him what he would say to Iraq's children, traumatized
by the noise of America's war planes and bombs, he replied:
"Tell them it's the sound of freedom."
