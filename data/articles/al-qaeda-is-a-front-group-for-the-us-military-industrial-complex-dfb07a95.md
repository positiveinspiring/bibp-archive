American-born Al-Qaeda terror leader Anwar Al-Awlaki, who met with
Pentagon officials months after
9/11,
is by no means the only patsy handler the Central Intelligence Agency has
used over the years to oversee false flag attacks in America and around the
world.
In fact, just about every major terror attack
has been run by an operative with direct ties to the US military-industrial
complex.
As we reported this morning, Awlaki, the man who helped plot the aborted
Christmas Day bombing, the Fort Hood shooting, the Times Square bombing
attempt, and who also preached to the alleged September 11 hijackers, dined
at the Pentagon just months after 9/11 documents obtained by Fox News show.
Awlaki is just the latest in a long list of Al-Qaeda double agents whose
activity proves that the terror organization is little more than a front for
the Pentagon and the US war machine.
Lets take a look at just a handful of dozens of
examples of terror masterminds working for intelligence agencies.
Emad A. Salem
The feds used FBI informant Emad A. Salem to run the first World
Trade Center bombing back in 1993.
Before the attack, the FBI planted informant Salem within a radical Arab
group in New York led by Ramzi Yousef. Salem was ordered to encourage
the group to carry out a bombing targeting the World Trade Centers twin
towers.
Under the illusion that the project was a sting
operation, Salem asked the FBI for harmless dummy explosives which he would
use to assemble the bomb and then pass on to the group.
At this point the FBI cut Salem out of the loop
and provided the group with real explosives, leading to the attack on
February 26 that killed six and injured over a thousand people.
The FBIs failure to prevent the bombing was
reported on by the New York Times in October 1993, as well as CBS News in
the clip below.
Haroon Rashid Aswat
The alleged mastermind of the 7/7 bombings in London, Haroon Rashid Aswat,
was also revealed to be an intelligence asset, in this case working for
British MI6.
In July 2005, terror expert John Loftus told Fox News,
back in the late 1990s, the leaders all
worked for British intelligence in Kosovo. Believe it or not, British
intelligence actually hired some Al-Qaeda guys to help defend the Muslim
rights in Albania and in Kosovo. Thats when Al-Muhajiroun got started.
Loftus said that British MI6 colluded to hide
Aswat after the 7/7 bombings. Watch the clip below.
David Headley
The mastermind behind the Mumbai massacre was an American secret agent who
went rogue, reported the London Times, referring to Washington-born
David Headley, who was caught smuggling heroin but then given a job by
the Drug Enforcement Agency and later went on to work for the CIA.
The Indian media has raised the possibility
that Mr Headley was being protected by his American handlers - a theory
that experts say is credible, reported the Times.
Headley was allowed to fly in and out of India
as he scouted targets for the attack despite being,
firmly on the radar of the US intelligence
agencies.
Prince Bandar Bush
Saudi Arabias former US envoy Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz,
known as Bandar Bush for his close relationship with former President
George W. Bush and his father,
is another terror mastermind on the payroll of the US military-industrial
complex.
Bandar worked closely with CIA Director
George Tenet, when he was Saudi Ambassador in Washington.
Bandar disappeared two years ago after it emerged that he had become the de
facto leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, having been responsible for arming
terrorist organizations in the Middle East.
The man who George W. Bush reportedly consulted
before the 2003 invasion of Iraq has trained, funded and equipped terrorists
to kill US troops, providing the US government with the perfect
justification to remain as an occupying force in the country.
Bandar also threatened Britain with another 7/7â€³ and the loss of British
lives on British streets if corruption investigations into Saudi arms deals
were allowed to proceed.
Prime Minister Tony Blair complied and
quashed the inquiry.

Osama Bin Laden
Bin Laden himself was a known CIA asset stretching from the late 1970s when
he was armed and funded by
the CIA through the
Pakistani ISI to lead
the Muslim mujahideen against the Soviets in Afghanistan.
After this,
Bin Laden led Al-Qaeda to Bosnia
shortly after the outbreak of war in 1992 to fight against Bosnian Serbs who
were subsequently the target of NATO air strikes.
Shortly before the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Bin Laden and
Al-Qaeda moved into Kosovo, Serbias southern province, to aid the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Albanian terrorist faction that was being supported by
the U.S. and
NATO in its terror campaign against Serbs
in the region.
The United States, which had originally
trained the Afghan Arabs during the war in Afghanistan, supported them
in Bosnia and then in Kosovo, reported the National Post.
With the help of Bin Ladens terror network,
backed up by the U.S. and NATO, no less than 90% of Serbians were
ethnically cleansed and forced to leave the region, while the
international media played its role dutifully in portraying the Albanians as
the victims of Serbian aggression.
Barely weeks before 9/11, former members of Al-Qaeda who had subsequently
joined the Kosovo Liberation Army were airlifted out of Macedonia by U.S.
paratroopers.
As former FBi translator Sibel Edmonds revealed, the US maintained,
intimate relations with Bin Laden, all
the way until that day of
September 11.
The war on terror is a
fraud
While Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano, FBI head Mueller and
others ceaselessly fearmonger about domestic terrorists being an imminent
threat, the federal government has a reliable menagerie of pocket Muslim
radicals on which to call upon to radicalize followers into launching an
attack on the great satan whenever the political climate deems it
necessary.
The fact that just about every major terror attack or aborted terror
scare for decades has been run by people with direct ties to US intelligence
renders the entire war on terror a complete fraud, and once again
underscores the truth that the real terrorists reside a lot
closer to home than caves in Central Asia or the Middle East.
