Eight years after 9-11, the American people and
the U.S. government are still woefully misinformed about what actually
happened on September 11, 2001. The media version of events, accepted by
most Americans, is based on a completely false understanding of the terror
atrocity that changed America and the world. This is, however, no
accident.
This is how Israeli false-flag terrorism is
designed to work.
The terror attacks of 9-11 were planned and carried out by Zionist
extremists with the intention that the blame would be assigned to Islamic
terrorists based in Afghanistan. Israeli military leaders and the
Zionist-controlled media were well prepared to interpret the attacks so that
public opinion would blame Muslims and Arabs for the atrocity.
Changing public opinion is the primary mission
of the architects of false-flag terrorism.
The evidence, however, indicates that the terror atrocity of 9-11 was not
carried out by Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaida, the Taliban, or any Muslim entity.
The discovery of chips of nano-thermite in the dust of the demolished World
Trade Center has fully exposed the official version, promoted by the
controlled media for eight years, as nothing but a pack of lies.
Whoever applied tons of super-thermite to the
Twin Towers had unrestricted access to every floor of the buildings and
state of the art nano-technology explosives. This was certainly not Osama
Bin Laden and his gang of twenty.
Thousands of American, Afghani, and Iraqi lives have been lost as a result
of the false understanding of 9-11, and the map of the Middle East has been
redrawn.
This is intentional, of course, and the
Zionist-controlled media has been the most important supporter of the lies
that surround 9-11. In the United States, the false interpretation of 9-11
has been vigorously promoted by Rupert Murdochs FOX News
and News Corporation, CNN/Time Warner, the New York
Times, and other Zionist-controlled
news networks.
The lies about 9-11 were prepared in advance to kick-start a
U.S.-led military campaign across the Middle East that would result in
American troops being permanently based across the region to support the
fortress state of Israel and its Zionist hegemony. This is what is called
the War
on Terror, which has been the Israeli plan since the mid-1980s,
as articulated by Israels current prime minister from the far-right Likud
party, Benjamin Bibi Netanyahu. This extreme Zionist
strategy became U.S. policy in the aftermath of 9-11.
It was planned that way, of course.
The invasion of Afghanistan, the response of President
George W. Bush to 9-11, has been called Obamas war because
of President Barack Obamas escalation of the nearly eight-year-old war of
occupation.
Despite the
discovery of super-thermite in the dust of the World
Trade Center, Obama continues to push the war in Afghanistan as a
response to 9-11:
Let us renew our resolve against those who
perpetrated this barbaric act and plot against us still, Obama said at
the Pentagons eighth anniversary ceremony. In pursuit of al Qaeda and
its extremist allies we will never falter, he said.
The war in Afghanistan, begun on 7 October 2001,
cannot rightly be called Obamas war. It can, however, be called
Baraks war if we mean
Ehud Barak, the current Israeli
defense minister and former prime minister.
Barak was the first person to call for a U.S.
war against Afghanistan and the chief architect of 9-11.
By being the first to interpret the attacks and
articulate the desired response, Barak revealed his role as a chief
architect of 9-11.
The false-flag terrorist
troika:
Shimon Peres, Bibi Netanyahu,
and Ehud Barak
The Israeli leaders Benjamin Netanyahu
and Ehud Barak were among the very first people to blame Osama Bin Laden for
9-11 and call for military action against the Taliban-led regime in
Afghanistan.
The false-flag attacks were designed and then
used by these Israeli leaders to start their long-planned War on Terror,
an Israeli military strategy pushed by Netanyahu for many years. The U.S.
military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq allows Israel to carry out covert
murderous false-flag terror operations in these beleaguered nations, acts
that are effectively disguised as sectarian violence by the
Zionist-controlled media.
It needs to be understood that Israel is, unlike any Western nation, a state
that is run by the military.
It is often said in Israel that while some of
the Zionists wanted Athens, they got Sparta. The Israeli military/security
establishment dominates the political affairs of the nation and has done so
for decades. Seven of Israels sixteen defense ministers, for example, were
also serving as prime ministers.
Four of them,
-
Moshe Dayan
-
Yitzhak Rabin
-
Ehud Barak
-
Shaul Mofaz,
...also served as Chief of Staff of the
military.
This is essential to understanding Ehud
Baraks key role in 9-11.
Ehud Barak, the current defense minister, was both prime minister and
defense minister of Israel from 1999 until March 2001. As defense minister,
Barak led the criminal aggression known as
Operation Cast Lead against the civilian
population of Gaza from December 2008 through January 2009.
Although Israeli forces under Baraks command
committed egregious war crimes in Gaza, neither Israel nor Ehud Barak has
been held accountable by the international community. The Israeli military,
for example, flagrantly used banned white phosphorous bombs on the civilian
population and intentionally bombed an American-run school and U.N.
compound.
The Israeli assault killed some 1,300 civilians.
Just this week, defense minister Barak approved the building of some 500
housing units on illegally occupied Palestinian land without a word of
protest from the administration of Barack Obama, which has openly demanded
an end to illegal Zionist construction in the occupied territories.
The position taken by
the Obama
administration is, however, merely a false front meant to placate
Arab states and public concerns about Israeli crimes in Palestine. In the
same way, president-elect Obama said he would have plenty to say about
Israeli war crimes committed in Gaza after he was inaugurated.
He has, however, been completely silent about
Israeli war crimes.
EHUD BARAK AND 9-11
Ehud Barak is a chief architect of 9-11. As Israels highest
military strategist in political office, his role in the false-flag terror
attacks of 9-11 was at the highest architectural level.
As the Israeli prime minister and defense
minister from 1999 through March 2001, Barak was at the top of Israels
political and military establishment when the false-flag terror attack was
being prepared. Although Barak was replaced as prime minister by Ariel
Sharon six months before 9-11, the project had been planned and was set to
go before Barak left office.
Barak was given a high-paying position with
Electronic Data Systems, an American company, only hours before the 9-11
attacks. Israeli crimes like 9-11 and the murder of President John F.
Kennedy are planned well in advance and compartmentalized for operation
security.
Outside observers were surprised when the extremely hawkish right-wing Likud
prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu took Barak, head of the Labor party, as
his defense minister.
The key fact to be considered in this
relationship is that Barak was Netanyahus commanding officer when they were
both active in Israels elite commando force, the Sayeret Matkal.
Ehud Barak was Netanyahus
commanding officer in the Sayeret Matkal.
Here they attend a June 2009
memorial ceremony for Netanyahus brother
who died in the Entebbe
operation headed by Barak.
Barak is known for heading the military response
to the 1972 hijacking of a Sabena Airlines jet, which was forced by four
terrorists to land at Israels Lod Airport outside Tel Aviv.
Barak led a team of Sayeret commandos, dressed
in mechanics overalls, which approached the plane as if to refuel it and
then stormed inside. Baraks commandos overpowered the hijackers and rescued
the passengers.
One of the men under Baraks command was
Benjamin Netanyahu.
Bibi was a good young officer, Barak
acknowledged to Serge Schmemann of the New York Times (May
21, 1996), referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. I tried to convince
him to stay in the army longer. He was good at that, but that does not
make him an appropriate [person] to run the country.
Barak was the key architect of the June 1976
Operation Entebbe, another rescue mission
to free the hostages of the Air France aircraft hijacked by terrorists and
forced to land at the Entebbe Airport in Uganda.
Netanyahus brother, Yonatan, was killed in this
raid. An Israeli school of terrorism was created in his name. The
relationship between Barak, the commander, and Netanyahu, the soldier, is
very close.
These men have worked as a team for decades.
BARAK INTERPRETS 9-11
In the immediate aftermath of 9-11, Ehud Barak, the former Israeli
prime/defense minister, was the first person to call for the U.S. to attack
Afghanistan.
On the very day of the attacks Barak told
Rupert Murdochs Sky Television that Western governments needed to make
a concerted effort to combat terrorism:
Most obviously my guess is a bin Laden
organization
We have to stand firm against such terrorism, Barak said.
We have to coordinate to launch the same kind of fight that our
forefathers gave to the fight against piracy on the high seas
mainly terrorists should not be allowed to land at any port or airport,
he said.
Note Baraks use of the pronoun our.
Whose forefathers is he talking about?
The leadership of the world should be able
to take action. It is time for action. The world is not going to be the
same place as before, Barak said. Bin Laden sits in Afghanistan,
Barak said on 9-11.
We know where the terror sites are. Its
time for action.
Baraks comments were reported in the
Washington Times of 12 September 2001.
Netanyahu and Barak are very
close in planning top-secret operations.
Benjamin Netanyahu, another former
Israeli prime minister, actually told the New York Times that the
terror attacks were very good for U.S.-Israeli relations on 9-11.
He also,
called upon all democratic nations of the
world to join an international coalition to crush the terrorist
organizations and the regimes that sponsor them, according to the
Jerusalem Post of 12 September 2001.
This military response is the pre-planned
Israeli strategy known as the War on Terror, which Netanyahu has been
pushing since 1986 in his books, articles, and speeches.
The Jerusalem Post of September 12, 2001, reported:
We must build a coalition against terror
today, when our power is unmatched, because tomorrow it could be
matched, Netanyahu said in a news conference at Jerusalems King David
Hotel.
Its time to take on militant Islamic
regimes with a great deal of strength. We should crush the terrorist
infrastructure that threatens the entire free world.
Netanyahu predicted that yesterday would be a
turning point in the history of the United States, similar to Pearl Harbor.
He called upon the United States to lead the effort against the Bin Ladens,
Arafats, and Saddam Husseins of the world.
The former prime minister said he predicted massive attacks on the World
Trade Center shortly after the last attack on the building, and in his 1995
book Fighting Terrorism.
Barak was ready with an editorial entitled Democratic unity is the only
answer to terrorism, published in The Times of London on 13
September 2001:
Terrorism has declared war on the free world
and the free world must unite to fight back. This is the inevitable
conclusion to be drawn from the horror of Tuesdays attack. Just as the
enlightened world mobilized in the past to combat challenges to its core
values, so must such an international coalition be built today
Let there be no illusions.
This attack is an attack on everything that
Western civilization holds dear - freedom, the rule of law, the sanctity of
human life. It is an attack on the open manner in which business is
conducted between people and nations and on the very fabric of human
interaction as we know it.
And we know who the attackers are. Whether Osama bin Laden was involved
directly or not, or whether it was another grouping, the worlds governments
know exactly who the terrorists are and exactly which rogue states support
and promote their activity.
Countries like Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and
North Korea have a proven track-record of sponsoring terrorism, while no one
needs reminding of the carnage wrought by the terrorist thugs of Hamas,
Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and even Yassir Arafats own PLO. The lines of
battle are clearly drawn.
Ehud Barak certainly knows who the attackers are.
He sees the chief architect of 9-11 every time
he looks in the mirror.
As an architect of the terror
atrocity of 9-11,
Barak was well prepared to
explain what happened to the Twin Towers.
