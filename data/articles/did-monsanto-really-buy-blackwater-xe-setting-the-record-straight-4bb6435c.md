There has been a great deal of publicity over
the potential purchase of
Blackwater (now known as Academi,
and Xe before that) by mega corporation Monsanto.
While the two seem to be a great match, as they both fail to consider the
morality and consequence of their actions, it seems that Monsanto is only
involved with Blackwater in infiltrating activist groups who are opposed to
the biotech giant - an operation quite sinister enough.
The truth of the matter is that
Academi (Blackwater) was purchased by
private investors, and the heavily sourced
article written by Jeremy
Scahill in The Nation actually says nothing about Monsanto buying
Blackwater.
What the articles does say, however, is that Monsanto and Blackwater are
indeed working together to target anti-Monsanto activists and organizations.
Known as far back as 2010, Blackwaters client list included,
...and many more.
According to
documents obtained by Scahill, it was also revealed that
Monsanto was willing to pay upwards of $500,000 in order for Blackwater to
join anti-Monsanto activist groups and infiltrate the ranks.
Furthermore, a number of Internet-based tactics
could be utilized as incognito PR for Monsanto, who undoubtedly knew
opposition would mount against their GMO crops as more individuals became
aware of the dangers.
Amazingly, the document stated that Monsanto
was 'concerned about animal rights activists' and that they discussed
how Blackwater could 'have our person(s) actually join [activist]
group(s) legally.'
Of course this occurred back in 2008, and
Monsanto admitted in e-mails that the relationship lasted until around 2010
- near the time the information came to light.
Raw Story
reports:
In an
e-mail to The Nation, Wilson
confirmed he met Black in Zurich and that Monsanto hired Total
Intelligence in 2008 and worked with the company until early 2010.
Even though Monsanto may not have purchased
Blackwater, their relationship with them remains quite clear.
Both organizations are noted for their crimes
against humanity, and they really do have a twisted synergy of sorts, so
it is quite easy to see how the topic became viral.
While they may not be owned by the same individuals, one thing is clear: the
relationship between these two companies is enough cause for alarm.
