# Amazon Sells Out of Orwell's '1984' as America Starts Paying Attention to 
What's Really Going On

Perhaps one of the
best examples comes from 2016, when the Pentagon was caught paying a
PR firm more than half a billion dollars to create fake
terrorist videos.
Russian President
Vladimir Putin
has also called out the desire by the elite for a
New World Order, which would see the "powers that be" use
"imaginary and mythical" threats to control us.
If you'd like to
learn more about the New World Order, you can read an article I
wrote about it in 2015 that goes into more detail
here.
"The statesmen will invent cheap
lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and
every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities,
and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any
refutations of them.
And
thus he will by and by convince himself the war is just, and
will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process
of grotesque self-deception."
Mark Twain

Keep in mind, this
just pertains to geo-politics; there are several other
examples within the health, food, education, finance, and other
industries.
We live in a world
of manipulation and propaganda, handed down to us by the global
elite, who would like us to believe this is simply a conspiracy
theory.
Now can you see the
correlation between our modern day world and
1984?
Recently,
Gizmodo.com reported that Amazon sold out of
1984, and within recent days it
occupied the number one spot on Amazon's best-selling books list.
The rapid sell-outs of the book were also reported by mainstream
media outlets like
CNN, only they tied it to Trump's administration.
The New York Times reported
that this started when Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to
Donald J. Trump, used a turn of phrase that struck some
observers as reminiscent of the dystopian world of
1984.
This is clearly
just another attempt by mainstream media to smear Trump. This
was not done at all with Hillary because she is backed by the
elite.
Any opportunity
they have to smear Trump, they'll take.
This,
unfortunately, is what politics has become - a cesspool of
corruption completely devoid of a suitable leader to choose from.
Any leader worthy of the name is ignored, because guess who controls
our attention? Mainstream media and the handful of powerful people
who run it.
We saw this with
Dr. Ron Paul all
three times he tried to run for president.
It's ironic because
the move toward tyranny, and a 'big brother' type of state,
which desires a heightened national security state, a watchful eye
on citizens, and an enormous amount of propaganda to shape our
perception of events happening around the world while, at the same
time, encouraging us to continually consume, is and has been in the
works well before Donald Trump.
The agenda has been
an American-dominated global empire where a tiny minority of people
control and own all aspects of our everyday lives, from,
...and everything else worth owning in this world.
We must understand
why Trump was demonized by the mainstream media, beyond the fact
that he made it easy for them to do so.
He has made plenty
of sexist, narcissistic, racist, and other statements that have
offended many, but the fact remains that
Hillary Clinton was
the ultimate representative and puppet for the American
establishment, which seeks to control the populace through various
means, and is leading many people to believe that the country is
heading toward a state of complete tyranny.
Author Richard
Dolan puts it quite well:
If you are
concerned about fascism coming to America, don't look for a fist
pounding demagogue.
Look instead at
a government that can read every email you have ever written,
GPS you at any time, know your internet habits better than you
do, surveil you literally wherever you go in any major city, and
use your information against you if they decide, however
loosely, that you are an enemy of the state.
That is
fascism, and the U.S. has been living that bipartisan nightmare
for 15 years. Thank you George W. Bush. Thank you Barack Obama.
Trump might
make that situation worse, or he might not.
But without a
doubt his rhetoric has spoken directly to those who feel left
behind by globalization, to a middle class that has been
effectively disemboweled over the last generation, in which
economic hope has all but evaporated.
Trump has
played to that part of the electorate, and only time will tell
whether or not he is sincere, or can deliver.

Whoever these
people are, and the agenda they are pushing, it's clear that Trump,
despite his power and privilege, is not in the same boat as the
Clintons, Bush, or Obama.
This does not mean
I'm a Trump supporter.
At the end of the
day, the real "menace of our Republic," as former New York City
Mayor John F. Hylan put it, is the,
"invisible
government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs
over our cities, states and nation."
It is the,
"little coterie
of powerful international bankers [who] virtually run the United
States government for their own selfish purposes," controlling
both parties and the majority of newspapers and magazines.
"They use the
columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of
office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the
powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible
government."
According to CNN,
1984 also saw a spike in sales
during 2013 when leaks by by
Edward Snowden made NSA surveillance a
huge international story.
Who knows, perhaps
Trump is also a part of this agenda - after all, there can be
disputes and disagreements among the elite, too.
The Orwellian State
Has Been Growing for a Long Time
The state described
in George Orwell's books has been in the works for a long time, and
for the past few decades, political parties have not existed to
secure the will of the people.
Theodore
Roosevelt, former President of the United States, was another
among many who tried to warn us that both parties have strayed from
their original purpose:
From these
great tasks both of the old parties have turned aside. Instead
of instruments to promote the general welfare, they have become
the tools of corrupt interests which use them impartially to
serve their selfish purposes.
Behind the
ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government,
owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the
people.

For mainstream
media to tie Trump to this book is ridiculous, given the fact that
the power that's controlled the
presidency for so long
is clearly the correct comparison.
What Can We Do About
It?
The good news is
that more and more people across the globe are
starting to wake up
to all of the misinformation being spread on a daily basis, and that
includes the agenda of those behind it.
Even a decade ago,
the mass populace was not as aware that all is not as it seems, and
as a result of this mass awakening, our perception, our thoughts,
our collective consciousness is beginning to shift.
We no longer see
the world the way it has been presented to us, and we are starting
to realize that simply waking up to all of the propaganda that
surrounds us is creating big problems for the global elite.
The very first step
to changing a problem is to first recognize that problem, and we are
still in that process.
Having worked in
this field for almost a decade, it's quite amazing to see what's
taking place, and how many people are having those 'ah-hah' moments.
The quest for world
domination does not sit well with the citizenry, and democracy has
become nothing but an illusion, with political parties serving the
interest of their 'owners,' not the people.
The more people
recognize what's really happening in our world, the more people will
take a stand and do whatever they can to change it. This is
happening now, in several different ways, and it starts with you and
me.
The more we try,
and the more we 'wake up,' the closer we get to actions and ripple
effects that will change our world...
