PROJECT SUPERMAN
A "VICTIM" OF THE ILLUMINATI'S
SUPER-RACE PROJECTS &
MONTAUK EXPERIMENTS SPEAKS OUT
The school year is now
winding down and I still have not made my final decision as to what
school I am going to attend. From out of the blue at the end of the
school year a coach from the University of Rochester shows up and
wants me to attend.
My father and I sit down to discuss that school I am going to attend.
We are at a Chinese restaurant on route 17 north in Ramsey. My father
sits me down and he starts talking. He said, "Andy, I have
nothing against Penn State, it's a fine school. However, why are you
going to college? To get an education or to play football?" I
said "to get an education". He said "Good, now what are
the odds of you becoming a pro football player?" I said
"slim to none". He said "Good, so since you are going
to school to get an education and not to play football don't you think
you should go to the best school you can possibly get into?" I
said "Dad, I WANT TO GO TO PENN STATE". Then he said
"I'm going to be the one paying for your school, IF YOU DON'T GO
TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER I WILL NOT PAY ONE THIN DIME FOR YOUR
SCHOOL AND I WILL NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN, DO YOU HEAR ME! Now
Rochester is a much better school and I'm sure you will be much
happier there, I'm going to pay for it and that's that".
So, I end up turning down a division 1 scholarship to attend a
division 3 school and end up paying $18,000 dollars a year to attend
the University of Rochester. For the longest time I absolutely hated
my father for making me go to the University of Rochester. I suppose I
could have come up with the $3,000 dollars on my own, but it was the
fact that he said that "he would never speak to me again" if
I didn't do what he wanted was what really pissed me off. And then on
top of all this then he springs on me that I will have to take out a
student loan in my name to help pay for going to school at Rochester.
I remember this as clear as day, because after that I remember I swore
that I would never let anyone tell me what to do with my life again.
The strange thing is that's not how he remembers it at all. He denies
ever saying that to me, but I remember specifically because I was
heart broken that I wasn't going to go to Penn State. The strange
thing is I remember my father, at about the same time, making a joke
that he had been out of the Navy for 15 years and for some reason they
wanted him to come in to give him a physical. He doesn't remember that
either.
Aug 1988- Football camp starts at the University of Rochester. Things
seem to go well. Let's just say that I am VERY focused on performing
well on the football field. I had trained very hard all summer and I
was in the best shape of my life. I do extremely well during the
training camp. I'm sure not by coincidence, I get my freshman year
roommate, we will call him Brian. Brian is also a freshman and is an
offensive and defensive lineman. He is 6-1 and 245lbs. He is huge, I
mean I thought I was muscular until I saw this guy. He talks openly
about his steroid usage, and even goes so far as to tell how that when
he came to camp "the coaches didn't recognize me, when I walked
into the coaches office, they said who are you?" and I said
"I'm Brian XXXXXX from Irondaquite" (he was supposedly a
local kid, Irondaquite is a local town). He talks about how as a
senior in high school he weighed 185 lbs, but then started doing
"juice" as he worked out with the New York state power
lifting champion. He goes from 185 lbs to 250 lbs in 12 weeks. As a
freshman he is the second strongest kid on entire the team, I am the
third.
Sept 1988-May 1989 Camp is over, and classes begin. I get an
"odd" message stating that the dean of the Psychology
department wants to see me???? So I go in to see him. I sit in a high
back green leather chair and I am facing him as he is sitting behind
his big desk. He asks me if I would like to participate in some kind
of special "study" the University is conducting. I tell him
"Have you ever heard of a Dr. Purrizzo" his face suddenly
becomes white and expressionless. I could tell that he had, at that
moment I hear a very slight creek from behind my left shoulder. I get
out of the chair and there is a door on the wall. I open it, inside
this "closet" the dean has a wet bar. But there crouching on
the floor is Dr. Purrizzo. I instantly grab him by his throat and tell
him that if I ever see him again I am going to kill him, he starts to
beg for his life, and I throw him into the bar. I walk over to the
deans desk and from the bottom I pick it up and flip it over onto him
and I yell something at him like "you stay away from me you lying
f*cking piece of shit". And I run out of the office.
A few days later I get a message saying that the dean of psychology
wants to see me again. I ignore it and don't go.
A few days after that I get a third message from him telling me that
if I don't come in to see him he is going to throw me out of the
school. I'm saying to myself "f*ck this", Brian is insisting
that I go. "Dude, he is going to throw you out of school, go in
and do what ever he says". "F*ck you" I tell Brian. I
decide to go in and give this ass hole a piece of my mind. As I walk
to his office I am furious and I am going to kick his ass. I remember
walking in, but I don't remember leaving.
After that I was a different person. I felt like I had blinders on
"tunnel vision." I remember people thought I was the biggest
"ass hole" because they would say "hello" to me as
I would walk to class and I would walk right by them. Like they
weren't even there, I was off in my own little world oblivious to
my surroundings.
Room 101 There was one building which I would walk by everyday.
Everyday, I would get the feeling that I had been there before. This
particular building gave me a disturbing feeling in my stomach, yet I
knew that I had never entered that particular building because none of
my classes had been in that building. Everyday as I walked by I would
get this "flash", "room 101" and I seemed to know
exactly how to get there.
One day I went in, the building had a suspended walkway in the middle
of it (it was very modern). I walk across the bridge, turn right and
go down the stairs. All the way to the bottom. At the bottom I turn
right again. There is a small hallway with only 2 doors. One on the
right and one on the left. Both doors have like a sliding name plate
holder on them. The one on the right is supposed to say
"101". It does not, it says "Janitor Supplies". I
am very confused. I turn to the door on the left to see if it says
"102." The slot is blank. I turn back to the door on the
right and reach for the handle. The door is locked. I leave the
building. Everyday when I pass that building I would get the same
uneasy feeling. Like I have been there before, or there is something
strange about it. A few days later I go back again, and again the same
thing. The door says "Janitor Supplies" and it is locked. I
leave again. The third time however was different. I get to the door
and it says "Janitor Supplies", at this point I'm just
giving it a casual look. I go down there, I look at the door, it says
"Janitor supplies" and I start to walk away. I'm pissed off
and confused. As I'm walking away I said to myself "screw
it" and I go back to check the door. I reach for the handle AND
THIS TIME IT TURNS. THE DOOR OPENS. For some reason I feel very
nervous and scared. I was afraid to go in. I push the door open and
very casually look in. It's very dark and I reach for the light. The
room is very small (only about 8 x 10). I look around and the room is
very "sterile". No books, no papers, nothing. There are only
two things in the room. One of those large athletic room training
tables. It's like a high cushioned table that athletes sit on to get
their ankles taped. Or if they are injured they lay on this to be
examined. It was black. The only other thing in the room was a very
small gray metal desk and a wooden chair. There are no papers, no
books, nothing.
As I'm about to leave, I reach for the desk drawer. I yank open the
drawer, and the only thing in it is a thin brass metal plate. I flip
it over and it says "101". My heart stops, I instantly start
to sweat. All of a sudden I AM VERY SCARED. I drop the plate, slam the
drawer closed, close the door and get the hell out of there.
Looking back and trying to peace this all together this is what I
believe happened. Either on my second visit to the deans office or at
some point there after they somehow hypnotized me. I can't remember
exactly where or when, but I believe they then instructed me to go to
that particular room, "room 101," at a certain time on a
certain day every week, and I would just "go" without
thinking or knowing anything about it. This is where all of the
initial "ground work" "programming" "hypnotic
suggestions" or "brainwashing" or what ever you want to
call it took place. I say this because after visiting "the
room" I started having these "memory flashes". Like a 5
second clip of a 10 minute movie. In the room I remember laying there,
we discussed my Silva mind control as well as many other things. The
instructor instructs me to go to my "level." And then would
begin his work, implanting the various different ideas and suggestions
they were researching with my reactions and responses. For some reason
the Library also gives me the "creeps."
How you use the "Silva method" is as follows. You close your
eyes, relax, with every breath you are becoming more and more relaxed.
The chair you are laying in is becoming softer and softer and you sink
further and further into it as it softly wraps around your body. You
feel warm and safe as your body becomes totally relaxed. Picture
yourself standing on the edge of an ocean. The sky is blue, the ocean
is blue yet almost green from the sunlight. It's an absolutely
gorgeous day. Picture yourself floating, upward as you leave your
body. You look down and see your body as you soar towards the sky. You
are not afraid, and you can soar as high as you want and you start
across the ocean. You look back at your body and it becomes smaller
and smaller until you cannot see it any longer. You turn back and all
that is ahead of you is blue sky and blue ocean, and like a god you
are flying among the clouds. Ahead of you is a very large cloud with a
structure on it. As you get closer you can see that it's an elevator.
You land on the cloud, touching down as softly as a feather touching
your skin. The cloud is as solid as rock. It is because you say it is,
this is your mind, it is a place where you can do ANYTHING YOU WANT
and WHERE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. The only limits here are the limits of
your own imagination. Walk over to the elevator. There is only one red
button, push it. The doors open, get in. Turn around there is a
control panel, push the bottom button. The doors close and the
elevator suddenly starts to descend. You look up, the elevator is made
out of a gray steel cage. There is no roof. The elevator starts to
descend faster and faster. You look up and see the walls of the
elevator shaft are brilliantly colored rock with swirls of orange,
black, white and silver. You see a huge number "10" painted
on the side of the rock go whizzing by as the elevator is now falling
faster and faster. You look up and see the number "9" go by.
As the numbers go by you are going deeper and deeper into the center
of your mind. The center of the universe. 8, 7, you're becoming more
and more relaxed 6, 5, you feel the power of your mind surge as you go
deeper and deeper, your mind becomes more and more powerful with every
moment 4, 3, 2 the elevator automatically starts to slow down, 1. The
doors open, you step out onto a white cement platform. It is 6 feet
wide and 6 feet long. Blackness is all around you. There is a small
silver railing to the left. Walk to the edge and look over. You see
nothing but a huge black hole. A swirling vortex sucking everything
into it. Jump off into the vortex like a skydiver. You are falling,
turn your self around and look back at the bottom of the platform as
it get smaller and smaller. You are not afraid, stuff is whizzing by
you as you fall a giant clock, a car, people you know, off to the left
you see a huge neon sign go flying by "1500". You fall
faster and faster and you feel yourself going deeper and deeper into
your mind. "1400", "1300", "1200", when
you get to "100" you will automatically slow down. Blackness
is everywhere and you can see nothing. You feel your foot touch the
ground as gently as stepping onto a pillow. To your left is a blue
neon door. Walk to it and turn the handle. As you open the door you
see a huge magnificent room blue neon room. This is your room. Your
"special place." The center of your mind and the center of
the universe. When you are in this room you can do ANYTHING and
NOTHING can ever harm you.
The room has 20 foot ceilings and has a blue neon glow. Being in the
room is like being under blacklights. Your whites glow, your teeth
glow, you look very tan and healthy. You have never looked better. On
the walls you have gems, great artwork, sculptures, the room is
magnificent. To the right is the universe machine. With this machine
you can travel anywhere in the universe with your mind, anywhere. To
the left is a set of stadium doors. Walk over to them and push them
open. You enter into a huge under ground dome stadium. So big it is
almost unimaginable. When you play here, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. Score as
many goals as you want, run for as many touchdown as you want. They
only cheer for you. Head out the doors back into the main room. To
your left is the most important thing. Another room, this one has a
red glow coming from it. You walk over to it, and enter. THIS IS THE
HEALING ROOM. The room has a red neon glow. There is a large circular
fountain in the middle of the room. If any part of your body is
injured when you are in this room it will glow bright red, if you have
tennis elbow, back pain, a headache, an injured knee. That part of
your body will be transparent (like looking at an x-ray) and you see
the injured part of body glowing bright red. To cure ANY AILMENT all
you have to do is enter the fountain. This is the fountain of youth
with magic emerald green water. If your knee hurts, soak it in the
fountain and your body will heal itself within moments. If you have a
very bad injury, lay in the pool but also use the flashlight. The
flashlight produces an extra power full beam of light which you shine
on the injured part of the body to heal it.
The healing pool and how I used it is a major link to understanding
what they wanted from me. When the instructor tells me to go to my
level, I do. What he tells me to do is this. Go to the healing room.
He then appears like a hologram and is talking to me in my mind. He
holds out his hand, in it is a test tube with a neon yellow substance
in it (like antifreeze for your car). He informs me that this is a TOP
SECRET formula and what it does is IT MAKES YOUR HEALING POOL EXACTLY
1 MILLION TIMES STRONGER THAN IT ALREADY IS!!! I PULL OFF THE CAP AND
DUMP THE YELLOW SUBSTANCE INTO THE POOL AND THE POOL INSTANTLY STARTS
VIOLENTLY BUBBLING LIKE SOMEONE TURNED ON THE JETS IN A JACUZZI. This
is now the healing pool in my mind, it will stay like this forever and
never decrease in strength. THIS NEW POOL CAN CURE ANY INJURY NO
MATTER HOW SEVERE. "COOL! this is awesome" I remarked. Some
how he also rigs my mind so that if I injure my self my mind will
automatically send "me" to the healing pool. As it turns
out, the suggestions he made to me while I was under hypnosis in
combination with the Silva method adhere to my mind extremely well.
And for some reason it REALLY WORKED. Some time later they gave me
another "test tube" full of another "top secret
government formula". This one was neon lime green. The instructor
tells me DO NOT EVER USE THIS TUBE WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION OR
INSTRUCTION!!! This one is 100 million times more powerful than the
yellow one and it is highly unstable. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WILL DO TO
YOU!!! KEEP IT IN A VERY SAFE PLACE! DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I answered
"yes" and then proceeded to create this really
"cheesy" looking sign and stand which I then "duck
taped" to the side of my fountain. It was made of poster board
and a wooden stake. With my really bad hand writing I wrote in black
marker "DO NOT USE.. BREAK ONLY IN A LIFE OR DEATH
SITUATION." And under this I "duck taped" the green
test tube to the poster board, and then "duck taped" the
sign and stake to the outside wall of the fountain. Sort of off to the
side and out of the way. It was blatantly an eye sore to the room, but
this was MY responsibility, and it was MY sigh and it was MY room. So
there it went, and there it stayed.
There were other suggestions as well of course, like telling me how to
"turn on and off my pain receptors" like a light switch, how
to control my adrenaline glands and be able to turn them "on and
off" like a faucet. How to control fear. I also remember them
testing me a lot with these puzzle blocks I had to assemble to match
the picture, connect the dots for time, word association, all kinds of
these "mind puzzles", (IQ testing type puzzles). This is
what I remember from room "101".
The small Lab I remember being tied to a metal table and them placing
electrodes on my body. They began to shock me at different intervals
and increased the voltage when I wouldn't corporate with them. The
thing is these insolent bastards kept asking me "Why are you so
hostile toward us? Why are you fighting us?" My answer would
always be "If you think I'm hostile now just wait until I get
loose you Nazi motherf*ckers!" I tried my best to be brave, and I
fought back with all I had. When I came to I found my self tied to a
chair with my hands tied behind me. They began working me over. I know
I had to be drugged because the punches for some reason didn't hurt.
They always wore gloves or hit me with a rubber hose as not to leave
any marks. And the more they hit me the more it didn't hurt. There was
also a metal cart next to me with all kinds of surgical instruments on
it. There were all kinds of syringes there as well. This is also why I
assume they drugged me.
I remember then placing needles in my eyeballs and also in my ear drum
in order to shock me into submission. They beat me in this small room
several times, I remember Mr. Green was there, this Nazi guy and his
buddies.
{note: remarkably, this "dr. green" has turned up in several
sessions involving people who were being 'deprogrammed' by
psychologists who have stumbled on to what seems to be a vast
mind-control conspiracy. Do a "find" search in the following
article for dr. green. Also, for more information on the Nazi-CIA
connections to a widespread mind control scenario, you can also read
about the group. Also, read about the unusual nazi - new jersey
connection - branton}
I know they were Nazi's because I have a very keen eye when judging
people and this guy just didn't seem to be an American. He was the guy
in charge, and he ordered another guy to come over and start to work
on me. This guy that came up to start beating me I made rude comments
about his attire. He was wearing a yellow short sleeve shirt in
Rochester NY after labor day. So I start sassing him about his shirt
and how the only two types of people would wear a yellow short sleeve
shirt in Rochester, either he is a homosexual or he is a foreigner who
is trying to look American, it's one of the basic slip ups spy's make
(a fashion blunder), and he was probably German because Germans like
their pastel's that along with the psychotic look in his eye told me
that he was some type of "Master Race" genetic freak. I was
basically pulling stuff out of my ass but I figured why not. He is
going to beat the shit out of me anyway, I might as well try and play
with his mind, it was the only offensive weapon I had. As he starts
punching. I'm calling him a Nazi bastard, telling him how we
American's kicked their ass in the war. But when I insulted Adolph
Hitler, and called him a faggot, and an idiot. This guy starts
freaking out and yelling at me in German "blah..blah! blah! Miene
Fuhurer..blah ..blah". "What do you know, he is
German!" I say. I had broke him mentally. For some reason his
punches didn't hurt, but he was hitting me so hard that he was
knocking me over in my wooden chair. What was happening was every time
he knocked me over with a punch he would weaken the legs on the chair.
My taunting in combination with the fact that he couldn't seem to hurt
me with his punches really got under his skin. So he goes over and
gets a baseball bat off the metal shelf and is going to hit me with
it. That's when I really feared for my life, and I pulled at my ropes
with all my strength. Some how I broke free, and spent a few seconds
getting the ropes off and everyone seemed to be in shock that I had
broke out of the chair and they all sort of stood around. I go after
the Nazi who had been beating me and who had the bat. I feel literally
that I am fighting for my life and to this day I don't know where I
got the strength but they all jumped on me and I flung them off me
like they were five year olds. I got to the guy with the bat punched
him once he dropped the bat I picked it up and struck him twice in the
head, while his head was pressed against a table basically crushing
his skull. I started swinging the bat around and I hit two other guys
in the head with the bat and I saw lots of blood coming from their
head as they lay on the floor. Then they all rush me at once and they
are trying to pin me down but they cannot and I manage to get over to
the only window in the room, I throw it open and I am about to leap
out when I see where I am. I look out and it's straight down at least
a hundred feet.
Your not going to believe this and I know that it sounds absolutely
crazy but I am in the top of the Library looking down at the ball
field. I know I was in the library first from the view and second from
the shape of the room one side was almost rounded, and now with the
view there is only one place it could be and that is the top of the
library (the location of the labs are enclosed in the drawing on the
other diskettes). I knocked out several more guys but there were just
too many of them and eventually they got me down and stuck a needle in
my butt and then I was out.
They gave me several beatings and several electric shock sessions
there. That's all I remember of the sessions. They were trying to
break me, but I wouldn't let them, so the beatings continued at night.
I remember telling my roommate the next morning that I felt like my
face had been hit by a truck, but yet I had no idea why my face was
hurting.
The Girl and "The Jump" October or November 1988?-
I am walking through the parking lot on my way to class. It is
morning. A car pulls up along side me from behind and stops. It's a
full size Lincoln or something (a very large car), it was brown. The
doors open and five men step out. They are all white. The first two I
instantly recognize. It's the man in green and the man in blue. The
same two I recognized from High school and before. The next one I also
have the feeling I have seen before. He was about 6-2 medium built
about 190 lbs. He is dressed in a long black leather coat. He has a
full head of blond white silver hair and blue eyes. He looks like
something out of Adolph Hitler's dream of an "Arian race".
He somehow has a very European face. He is "older", I would
estimate mid to early forty's. He is expressionless, with high cheek
bones. I can very vividly picture his face. I remember just by his
looks and mannerisms he is a very serious person. I didn't know it at
the time but he is the man who is in charge of the beatings in the
roof of the library (he is a Nazi, one of their genetic experiments).
During one if the beatings in the "small lab" I named this
person "Adolph" and from here on in that is what I call him.
The last two were around the back of the car. They were dressed in
sort of a "sport suit." Dressed like an "agent" or
something, dressed nicely but built for travel. I didn't recognize
them at first sight.
They stayed in the back behind the car and they were quite large. The
man in green says that they want to talk to me, and he instructs me to
get in the car. I become scared. I told him that if he wanted to talk
to me, start talking, but there is no way I'm going to get into any
car with five guys I don't know! He said that he wanted to talk to me
about participating in some sort of program. I told him that what ever
he wants from me the answer was "no". He then said that
"NO" was an unacceptable answer, and that I was going to
participate whether I liked it or not because I was too valuable and
"NO" was not an option. He then said "Andy, get in the
f*cking car." I said "No." The man in the black leather
coat with the white hair "Adolph" grabs my arm and starts
pulling me toward the open car door (back seat drivers side). My
instinct just seems to take over, I wrench my arm away from Adolph let
me tell you I START RUNNING. This is going to be difficult to explain
without a visual aid but here go's. The parking lot was a very long
and thin lot, not like a square, but like an "I", only two
places to park your car, on the right or on the left and its very
long. The lot is located below the level of the campus by about 70 to
80 feet. There is a long slope as an embankment and about every 100
yards or so there is a set of stairs to get in and out of the lot. At
the top of the stairs there is a main road which runs along the entire
campus. So once you cross the road you are right there on campus.
Buildings start about 50 feet in from the road.
I break away from Adolph AND I START RUNNING. I ran as fast as I could
for the stairs. The stairs were about 50 yards away, I reach them
unmolested. I turn back and look to see if they are chasing me. They
are not, as I look back all the men have gotten back in the car and I
just catch a glimpse of the last car door closing. I pause, thinking
the car is going to come towards me, the tires squeal but in REVERSE.
I think, it hits me, they are going to cut me off at the top of the
stairs. AT THAT MOMENT for the second time I felt the "the
rush." The first time was when the man was going to hit me with
the baseball bat. But for the first time in my life I felt like I was
running for my life. That if they beat me to the top of the stairs it
was all over. By "the rush" I mean the adrenaline rush, your
mind closes like having blinders on and the surge of power your body
feels when it's life or death. If you have never been in a situation
where you truly "feared for your life." You really cannot
understand the feeling I am talking about. I bounded up those stairs,
three of four stairs at a time. At the top is a car parked right in
front of the stairs, it's maroon but it's facing the wrong way. I
crouch next to the rear fender and I see the first car about 200 yards
away and I hear the engine rev as the driver floors it. Flying over
the speed bumps. The car passes the parked car and I dart across the
road. Out of my left ear I hear the screech of tires skidding, as I
look the car has stopped and I see the drivers eyes in the rear view
mirror. It is turning around. I get on the sidewalk and then 30 feet
onto campus ground. For some reason I feel safe and I stop running in
order to "blend in". There are many people around walking to
class. I look back at the car, it looks like it's going to jump the
curb. It does and All the students scatter like ants seeking cover.
I'm left standing there by my self. A girl, who I had never met
before, when all the others ran away, for some reason she ran to me.
She grabs my arm and without saying a word tells me that she is not
afraid. That instant seemed to last forever.
I hear the driver gun it. As the rear wheels now jump the curb. With
my right hand I grab her left hand as I scream RUN! I turn and run for
the nearest building. My right arm lags way behind me after two or
three steps as her left arm is stretched as far forward as it can go.
She is not fast enough. We are not going to make it. With my right
hand I let go, I point to the right and yell "RUN." Out of
my right eye after one or two steps, I don't see her. I slow down and
turn to look back. She has stopped running. She turned and is facing
the oncoming car placing herself right between me and the cars path
believing they will stop or turn to avoid her. She is about 5 yards
behind me, I am at the base of the steps of the building. All I hear
is the engine as the driver floors it. She has no chance, I have no
chance of saving her. This all happens in a split second. I turn back
toward the building and leap up the stairs. The car is right behind
me. I jump from the stair to the railing to side of the building,
scurry up as I hear the crash below. Somehow I'm on the roof. I take a
quick look around and there is nothing but pipes coming up out of the
tar and a single door. I run for the door and when I get there it is
locked. I hear someone calling my name, I go back and look over the
edge. There are two cars below me, the Lincoln is crashed into the
building, the maroon car that I hid behind for a split second is
undamaged behind it. The man with the white hair is standing there
looking up at me. He starts talking, he is stalling, he says
"Andy, that was very impressive, very impressive indeed. Do you
have any idea what you just did." He backs down the stairs and
gets a running start... The building is a perfect square. The first
floor all the way around is glass. From there up is all marble. On the
corners are big square pillars. Which stick out 90 degrees from the
side of the building forming a perfect right angle. I had jumped from
the stair railing to the side of the pillar to the side of the
building back to the side of the pillar all the way up to the top
(left, right, left, right all the way). Grabbed the railing and leaped
over. He tries to get to me the same way I came up the side of the
building, comes close but slides back down the side again. I'm looking
right into his eyes as he slides back down. He is yelling at me
"I'm very impressed Andy, you have extra ordinary
abilities". I yell back "F*CK YOU". He continues,
"You just did what we call a five step 90 degree vertical climb,
how do you explain that!" I yell back "I'M WEARING MY
NIKE'S." The instant I said that I hear a chuckle behind me, I
spin around. There are four guys on the roof sneaking up behind me.
The man on the ground keeps yelling for me to come back to the edge, I
ignore him. The four men now have spread out. They are moving very
slowly towards me. They say they are my 'friends'. I say "if you
are my friends stop and don't come any closer." They keep moving
closer. Two of them reach in their jackets and pull out pistols.
At that point I say "F*ck this" and lunge at the guy on far
right (he was the smallest). I get by him and run for the now open
roof access door. The men with the pistols shoot at me. They couldn't
have missed because it was a range of only 6 or 7 feet. There was no
sound, and the guns looked a little "funny". They weren't
shooting bullets, it was some sort of dart gun, or pellet gun. I don't
know what it was, all I know is it wasn't bullets because they shot me
and I just kept running. There are two more guys right inside the
door. They have the same guns. I blow by them and they shoot me too. I
make my way down to the first floor. The wrecked car is to my left
wrapped around the pillar. I see a bloody hand under the car and blood
is seeping out from under the car everywhere. I run out the door to my
right, down the stairs, and out onto the quad. I'm running as fast as
I can. I look back and they ARE chasing me this time. I run into
Wilson commons (a huge open multilevel glass building which is the
student center). I STOP running and casually begin walking among the
crowd. I feel safe with people around. I'm inside the building. Two
men in suits run in behind me, I start running again. Willison commons
is basically a six story glass box. The entire middle is open. There
is a spiral staircase which runs along one side of the building. There
are three ways to enter the building. From the top, which is connected
to the quad by a walk way. From the main entrance which brings you to
the main floor, or through the basement (cafeteria level). It is
easily a 100 foot drop from top to the very bottom.
I'm at the top with two men behind me. I go for the stairs and start
going down. I get three levels down and enter on to the main floor.
The man with the white hair is coming right towards me with three
other guys in suits. I turn and run back up the stairs. The other two
men are right there. I'm trapped. I turn to my left and leap over the
railing without looking. One of them yells "NO DON'T DO IT."
I thought I was jumping just to the main level, which is only about
one story. I fell all the way to the bottom. Which is at least 50
feet. When I jumped I did it with no hesitation and no fear. I truly
believed that if they caught me my life would be over so again without
hesitation I hoped over the railing without hesitation. I leaped over
and immediately focused on where I was going to land. Like a moment
frozen time, I didn't wave my arms or yell, my body was frozen like a
statue as it fell. My mind suddenly took over, and I envisioned my
legs as being "steel springs" (my lower body is extremely
strong from weightlifting) and I squeezed my legs and butt as tight as
I could. Knees bent, head up, just like I was squatting 500 pounds. I
hit the ground hard, and I mean with tremendous force. It was just
like "BA-BOOM" the thing is it worked. Just like steel
springs my legs absorbed the impact and I literally
"bounced" several feet in the air then came crashing down on
a table. As I'm laying on my back I open my eyes and they are all
looking at me from the point on the staircase which I had jumped. They
thought I was dead. But something inside me says "get up"
and I did. They start running down the stairs after me, and I start
limping away. My dorm room is only two buildings away. I go out the
basement entrance and ran as fast as I could right for my room. I make
it back, and rush in, Brian is there, I start freaking out "LOCK
THE DOOR" "DON'T LET ANYONE IN" "THEY ARE AFTER
ME". I feel my body start to collapse, I climb into my bunk bed
and curl into the fettle position and I am out like a light.
I hear voices, "I told you I hit him." I feel hands all over
my body but I cannot move. Everything is black. They ask me how is my
ankle? I tell them its fine! I've already healed it!
I wake up, and I am in some kind of shock. I'M DAZED, CONFUSED, IN
SOME SORT OF HAZE. I am not all right, it's like the world was
spinning. I look at the clock and it is 2:00 AM (I was out for
approximately 14 hours). Brian is gone, I'm still dressed and I wander
outside. My mind is not there. I remember what happened but it is like
a bad dream. My head and my mind keeps spinning, around and around,
what happened? Did that really happen? I wonder back to the building
where the car crashed to see if it really happened. There are lights
all around the building. As I get closer I see men in yellow jump
suits working. These men were not with the University maintenance
department. There are three vans, a man is painting the railing that
the car hit. But it's fixed. Two men are on their knees working on the
marble block which was damaged by the car. I stop and watch them. One
of the men sees me and calls for another man. He points at me, the
other man promptly puts something to his ear, either a phone or a
radio type device. I am looking right at him and he is looking right
at me. I turn back and start walking back to my room. Brian is now
there, I enter the room and he is pissed "WHERE DID YOU GO"
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF BED?" He puts me to bed, and then
I hear him pick up the phone and start dialing. I'm out within
seconds.
I wake up, and it's in the afternoon. I'm still in some sort of shock.
I am not all right, I can feel it. I get dressed and head right for
the building. I'm still in some kind of daze. Everything is one big
blur. I get to the building. There is no sign of any damage. No broken
glass, no cracked marble block, no mangled railing. Nothing! I go to
the marble block where the car crashed, examine it, I find nothing. I
go to the railing it's like new. It looks out of place almost, too
new, I look at it carefully, it's freshly painted. I put my finger to
it and that paint is still "tacky". I go to the other
railings and they are all still tacky. But what I noticed was the
cement around the whole area was "white". {sounds like a
little 'reality engineering' taking place there - branton}
The cement which held the other railings in place matched the white
cement perfectly. I go back to the damaged railing and look down. The
cement holding that one in place is not even close IT IS GRAY. I put
my finger to it. It's dry and hard but very gray and looks too new (it
had sort of a gloss to it). I go back to the marble block, again I see
nothing. I put my hand to it and I think I feel something. I take my
student I.D. out and run the edge along the block. I hear a
"click" or "skip", when I looked very closely you
could see a hairline crack running all the way through the block. I
retrace my steps all the way back to Wilson commons. I get to the
commons and I enter. It's crowed, as I start walking through the
crowd, there seems to be some kind of commotion, everyone is looking
at me. When I make eye contact with them, they look away. I turn the
corner into the main room. I look at the spot from which I had jumped,
and there are men in suits MEASURING with one of those long tape
measure's they use in sporting events (it's like a big wheel and you
crank it to retrieve the tape). They are measuring all the distances.
From how far I jumped to how, to how far I ran, everything. Then I see
a group of men in suits (6 to 8) are walking to my left. One of the
men sees me and as he tells someone else he points to me. The man with
the white hair emerges from the pack, and like a deer caught in the
headlights I FREEZE. I cannot move as I watch him walk toward me. My
instinct tells me to run but I am paralyzed with fear. He walks right
up to me, and that's all I can remember.
That night, I sat in my room with my elbows on my knees and my head
between my hands. As I think about the events which had happened, the
room begins to spin. I'm very scared, I don't know what to do. I want
to call home. I want to call my mother. I can't remember the number.
I'm looking for it. I find my address book and I find the number.
Dialing the number seems familiar, but it feels odd. As the phone
starts to ring, Brian opens the door and enters the room. He sticks
his finger on the phone and I am disconnected. He starts to speak to
someone in the hall, they enter, it's the man in green and the man in
blue and Adolph. The sight of these men in my room, speaking to Brian.
They know each other, and they know where I live, I'm thinking. This
causes such fear in me that the room spins out of control and I black
out as the two realities came crashing together.
The Big Lab After that I was not the same person, and they began
taking me to a lab. Two men in overcoats would knock on my door, I or
Brian would open it, they would say two or three words, I would drop
what ever I was doing, get my coat and go with them. I had no say, I
had no control. That was it I just did it, I don't know why, it was
just like when I pulled the car over for Mr. Purrizzo. They had a car
outside, I would get in the back and just sit there with a blank stare
in my eyes. The lab was, I would estimate, from 30 to 90 minutes away.
I say this because the first few trips I remember the trip. I remember
getting on a divided two lane highway, it had to have been the New
York state thruway (the only divided highway around) and we road for a
while. I remember them asking me if I knew where I was, asking me if I
knew what time it was, was it night or day, and with a big smile I
said "of course I know where I am" as I was proud for out
smarting them by remembering landmarks and remembering where we were
going and how we got there. After that I remember the men in the car
"doubling back" one exit on the thruway, and when we arrived
the man with the white hair and black leather coat would ask me again
"do you know where you are" and again I would tell them
exactly what they wanted to know. After that I don't remember any more
"rides". I remember getting in the car in front of the dorm,
and then I remember getting out of the car in front of the lab (the
facility). I think they finally got smart and programmed my mind
somehow so that when they said the word "sleep" or some
similar command, I would instantly lay on the seat and would be out
like a light until they decided to re-awake me, because after that
there was no more "ride" only getting in of the car and
getting out of the car.
At the big lab is where the torture continued but the more
sophisticated experiments took place. The head of the project was
Adolph. He was no ordinary agent or CIA man, he is a Nazi. Him and his
partisans just had the "look" of some Nazi genetic
experiment. The psychotic eyes, the "Arian" face and
features such as the straight blond hair. After I had killed two of
his "boys" in the small lab with the baseball bat he kept
trying to tell me that he was my "father", and he seemed
obsessed with this idea. He had similar abilities of his own, but I
was more powerful. I know this because the first few times I tangled
with him he threw me, but once I figured out how he was simply
misdirecting my force into another direction, I then could take him.
He knew this and after I threw him a few times he no longer would try
and step in and stop me if I got loose, he would let all of the
"hired hands" try and stop me. He was the one who in my mind
could stop me, somehow he implanted in my mind that I could not harm
him. I didn't fear him, I would just avoid him if I was making an
escape. As in my mind he was the most powerful one out of the group.
He was also the one who did all of the "coaching" or
"directing" if you will. None of the other guys really said
much to me. They mostly talked off to the side amongst themselves, and
when called upon to help out they never said a word unless it was to
answer a question asked by Adolph, never a word directly to me.
Remember, at this point they had already had TOTAL control over me,
and I mean TOTAL control. They tell me to get in the car, I get in the
car. They tell me to stand over there, I go and stand over there. They
tell me to stand in the corner, and I was like a "robot" I
would go stand in the corner, once there I stood like a statue until
spoken to again.
There always seemed to be a guy with a video recorder, recording
everything, and I mean everything. Even in the chase across campus
when the girl died, one of the men had a camera on his shoulder. I
only got a glimpse of it but it was no VHS recorder from SEARS. It was
one of those bigger cameras with a light on top that the news crews
use, only it was a quite a bit smaller but the same style. So at the
small lab as well as the big lab, they were recording everything I
did. From how I stood to how I sat to how I stripped down to my
underwear. The camera was always watching me.
To start the tests were simple at the big lab. They would tell me to
do "push ups," and I would start doing push ups. The thing
is I would do push ups until they told me to stop. When I was
"myself" (not under hypnosis or their "mind
control") I already could do more push ups than probably 99% of
the population. 150 maybe 200 without stopping (with perfect form),
don't forget I was invited to be on, or "tryout" if you will
for the U.S. Power lifting team, and I'm in the best shape of my life.
But when under hypnosis they would tell me to start, and then start
playing cards on a fold out card table. I have no idea how long I
would do them for but it was a while (1/2 hour, an hour I don't know).
I wouldn't think I would just do.
The focus of the initial research, I believe, was to try and unlock
the secrets of the mind. How to make the perfect soldier, to make a
"super human killing machine". They were finding out how,
when under hypnosis, can the mind over come the physical limitations
of the human body. How, when under hypnosis, can the mind overcome the
physical impossibilities of going against the laws of physics? How,
when under hypnosis, can the mind overrule the build up of lactate
acid which occurs in the blood stream when muscle contraction occurs?
How can the mind allow the body to do things which would normally be
physically impossible?
To be able to do push ups for the length of time and the number of
repetitions that I did them for would be a physical impossibility. Yet
there I am doing it. How could I do it? Because of the way my mind
"thinks" if you will, is different from everyone else.
Somehow if you tell me to do something on the subconscious level I
truly believe that I can do it. So how did I do it, UNDER HYPNOSIS,
THEY TOLD ME I COULD DO IT! AND I TRULY BELIEVED THEM!!!
They did all sorts of similar tests on me. I remember next they bring
in a squat rack and barbell set. They put a bunch of weight on and
tell me that these are "fake plates" and that the bar is as
"light as a feather". It's just like doing deep knee bends
with no weight at all, and then instructed me to starting squatting. I
would then begin exercising until they told me to stop. It was very
strange because I could hear the "clang" the weight plates
make when you have four or five stacked on each side and you are
squatting. In testing at Rochester I squatted 545 pounds as my
maximum, when I was squatting in the lab I think I was doing seven 45
pound plates on each side (which is 675 pounds for as many reps as
they wanted). I would just start "squatting" and I would not
stop until they told me to. Yet it felt like there was no weight
pressing on my shoulders at all. It was in reality "as light as a
feather", just like doing simple deep knee bends.
Another favorite was to sit me down in a chair and tell me to envision
my arm not as an arm but as a huge robotic hydraulic vice. This vice
had unlimited power, and ANYTHING they placed in my hand I could
crush, just like squeezing an "egg." They then would proceed
to place various objects in my hand, and I would crush it like a egg.
In my mind I wasn't squeezing an unopened can of Coke. I was squeezing
an egg, and I would crush it accordingly. I remember they put some
kind of gauge in my hand to see what the pounds per square inch was
that I was producing. It was like one of those old hand exercisers you
would squeeze. The first time I squeezed it, I broke it, and they got
all excited. They had to "recalibrate" another one for me,
and again I buried the needle on their gauge, and this astounded them.
They made me feel "good" about being able to do these
things, and I was sort of "proud" of my self. As my
confidence grew, my abilities grew. It was all like a game to me. They
would set up some kind of test, something that I should not be able to
do, and I would live to prove them wrong.
They told me to walk around with my chest stuck out and head held high
because I was "the biggest, badest, meanest motherf*ckering stud
on the planet and if you F*CK with me I will kill you." This
particular suggestion caused some very serious problems later on.
They said we need a name to call you by. This name is something very
special, it is the name that ONLY WE may call you by, it is your code
name and you should spend some time thinking about it because it is
very important. I answered almost immediately "I want to be
called THE RHINO" I said. I had chosen this name because it was a
name I wanted as my "nickname" on my high school football
team. However in high school the nickname was already given to another
player so I could not have it, but for some reason I always thought it
was really "COOL", and now that I could choose any name I
wanted, I chose "the Rhino" and that's why I chose "the
rhino" as my new name. At first the man with the white hair and
black leather coat as well as the other guys laughed at the name, but
after a while it grew on them and they liked it. The man with the
white hair and black leather coat would bark out "RHINO" get
over here, and it would come running like a puppy and then he really
started to like it.
I think they made me choose a different name not only for the
practicality of it, but more so to disassociate my "new
self" from my "old self." In other words, when they
called me they didn't want any association to do with my "old
self", anything to do with "Andy". Mostly because they
never broke "Andy", since they could not break
"Andy" they sort of had to build over him. They squashed
"Andy" into a vacuum sealed steel coffin and buried him
under tons and tons of ten foot thick steel plates the each the size
of a football field, and buried him in the deepest part of my mind.
They wanted "Andy" to be totally gone, but I remember they
could NEVER destroy or break him. I think that is why I still remember
all of these events. That fact really angered the man with the white
hair, and really frightened Mr. Green as his worst fear is that I will
remember and come back for him. And believe me he WILL see his day in
court, for honestly I have no fear of dying anymore because I have
touched what is beyond this life and despite all of this I still
somehow have an "inner peace" if you will. A fact that I am
no longer afraid of the darkness and afraid of the night. But anyway,
when they called me they wanted "THE RHINO".
They wanted me to think ONLY as "the Rhino". They wanted the
biggest, badest, meanest motherf*ckering stud on the planet, and if
you F*CK with me I will kill you "RHINO."
What I didn't know at the time was that my father, when he was in the
Navy, was part of an elite ultra top secret nuclear explosion test
that he was hand picked for. The name he chose was also "the
Rhino". This must have proved very interesting to them. At this
point I discover that they had been taking me from the age of 2 years
old. As I was from the very beginning part of a HUGE genetic
manipulation project along with my father and along with most of the
armed forces in the United States which has been going on sense the
1960's. More about this later.
As the conditioning continued they were particularly interested in
"the jump." I remember discussing it with them. They asked
me how did I do it? I answered "I don't know, but when I jumped I
had no fear, as I was falling I was like a cat, calm and cool, again
no fear, focusing like a laser only on the landing, before the impact
the 'steel springs'." As a result of this, of course, they start
having me "jump" off of things. As you can imagine it, what
they did to me was not pleasant. When you jump you are a cat, they
told me. You will always land on your feet and you will always be OK
no matter how high. You will have no fear. Every jump in your mind is
as easy and as safe as jumping off a footstool. When you land, your
legs become steel springs and will absorb all impact. The size and
strength of the steel springs will automatically adjust to the height
of the jump for you. There is no pain, and you have no fear!
They started me off with small jumps to begin with (off a six foot
step ladder). I remember this because they wanted me to stand on the
fold out tray that clearly says "this is not a step" and I
didn't want to because it clearly said "this is not a step"
so I ended up going to the top step (it was no big deal in terms of
height, but it was in my mind a big deal in terms of things you should
do and things you should not do). So I specifically remember that.
Next it was up a ladder to a platform they had in the "Big
Lab", maybe 25-30 feet. Then it was off the side of the big lab
outside (the top of the building). We would then progress to jump off
objects that were higher and higher.
What they would do is bring me to a certain spot (whether it was a
bridge or a cliff) and simply say "Jump", we will meet you
at the bottom. And I would simply say "OK" walk to the
railing and jump over. I wouldn't look first and then back up and then
jump. I would just, jump, RIGHT OVER. I would land like a cat, bounce
in the air from the release of the stored energy in the compacted
steel springs that were my legs, do a shoulder roll as I landed the
second time from the "bounce", stand up, and wait for them.
It was just like jumping off a footstool and it was just as easy.
The next day or so, I would find my self wandering back to the same
spot during school hours, what ever it was (a bridge, a cliff, what
ever) and as I retraced my steps, when I got to the jumping point I
would look over the edge AND MY HEART WOULD DROP INTO MY STOMACH. I
remember saying to myself "this is wrong, it was not this
high" because to me the night before the jump was nothing
"like a footstool" now I'm looking at it and saying "NO
F*CKING WAY IS THIS RIGHT, NO F*CKING WAY". These things are not
physically possible. I became very scared, and I became even more
confused.
I remember one night walking through this chain link gate, and I began
climbing up this white ladder with a round cage all around it. I'm
climbing and I'm climbing, it seemed to go on for ever. I reach some
kind of a platform which is made of some kind of metal grating. There
is a man standing there and he tells me to climb further, until I
reached the next platform. I did notice he was wearing a safety
harness and was clipped on to the structure with a rope. I had no fear
at all about where I was or what I was doing. The ladder had changed
to a 4 inch pole with the rungs now welded on the outside. Like a
ladder you would see at the circus. When I reach the top, the platform
is only about 3 feet by 4 feet. I remember all of a sudden being
almost blinded by red, and then it would go away, red and it would go
away. So I turn my back to it. I look down and the man on the lower
platform yells to me to jump. I simply jumped off without fear and
with out hesitation. I remember freezing like a cat in the air for a
split second, and then hitting the ground. I hit the ground fairly
hard and my ankle felt a slight twinge of pain, as I bounced I ALWAYS
kept my eyes focused on the ground, on the exact spot of landing. I
did my shoulder roll, and stood up, my ankle hurt some what but I was
fine. This did not seem like jumping off a footstool, it was more like
jumping off a six foot ladder. Still no problem at all, I walked off
the pain in my foot and didn't think twice about it. I walked over to
the group by the car and just stood there. There were three or four
dark figures talking amongst themselves. They were in a group and off
to the side of the car, it was dark and all I remember is there
shadows.
I watched as a small black figure was climbing down the structure. He
looked like an ant on your kitchen wall. He gets to the bottom, takes
off his gear and starts running over to us. He is all excited. It's
Adolph. He is screaming with excitement and he runs up to me and hugs
me and pats me on the back as he talks to the figures behind me. I
remember standing there and saying to myself "are these guys
idiot's, or just f*cking retarded. What is the big f*cking deal about
jumping off a dam small ladder like that! And why the HELL am I out
here in the middle of the night to do this stupid shit anyway!" I
didn't understand any of it but I remember being very annoyed at them
for wasting my time with such simple tasks.
The next morning I woke up and I remembered this strange dream I had.
I remember climbing and climbing a white ladder. Like I was on the
Eiffel tower, and the gate. When I reached the top I looked for a
second at the magnificent view, and then I was on the ground again.
This dream was really weird because most dreams you remember for about
10 minutes or so, but I was thinking about this ALL day for some
reason. As the day goes by I peace together that this is happening in
Rochester, and I think I remember land marks like the 7-11 and I think
I know how to get there. Finally after dinner I decided to get in my
jeep and try and "feel" my way to this place. Without any
mistakes I turn right here, drive for a while and turn left there. I
find myself turning onto this grass field and a dirt path. I drive to
the tree line and there is a chain link fence so I must stop. I leave
my headlights on and walk to the fence. I'm standing in front of the
"gate" in my dreams. I see something beyond it and as I
focus there is a field, and in the middle of it is a bunch of lights
and some type of structure behind it. I cannot make it out clearly
because of the shadows from the lights. So I stoop down to one knee
and look up. I could barley see because the trees were overhanging my
view. It was a huge microwave radio tower. This didn't make any sense,
so I put my face so it was almost touching the ground and I looked up
and saw the red flashing light ALL THE WAY AT THE TOP. When I saw the
red flashing light my head instantly started to spin and I threw up
several times right there. I don't know how long I was there, but I
remember driving home and I was profusely sweating. Like sweating
after you throw up from a hang over. I finally get home, and like my
mother Brian is asking me where I've been. So I tell him the story
about the dream and for some reason he seem very annoyed about this,
but I don't know why. I go to bed still sweating and shaking. The next
morning I remember waking up and feeling absolutely terrific.
This event must have occurred soon AFTER thanksgiving of 1988, because
during the thanksgiving break freshman year is when I bought the
1979-three speed jeep CJ-5, and then took it up to school. The thing
is after I told Brian where I had been they placed a tracking device
under the rear wheel well of my jeep on the passenger side (inside the
fender on the rear wheel passenger side). I remember this because I
was going to my jeep one evening and I noticed a big rock stuck in my
tire and I tried to pry it out but I couldn't so I went and got my
tire iron to pry it loose from the deep tread (that's the kind of guy
I am, if I see something wrong on my car I can't just leave it because
it would bother me until I knew it wasn't there). So anyway I pry it
out of the deep tread (they were brand new 33 x 12.5 x 15 flotation
tires with new tread) and as I pry it out the tire iron and the rock
fly up into the wheel well and the rock, the tire iron and this little
black magnetic box come out. It was the same size and shape of one of
those "Hide a key" boxes, as a matter of fact that's what I
thought it was. But it wouldn't open, it was just a box with a magnet
and a wire sticking out of it. At that instant I became scared because
I didn't exactly know what it was but from somewhere inside me I had
my suspicions (since I never put it there). I had parked right next to
the bus stop, and as I am holding this little black box a bus pulls up
and is going to let some people out, so I said to my self "why
the f*ck not" so I ran over to the bus and stuck this little
black box under the wheel well of the bus and it pulled away. And with
in minutes I had forgotten all about it.
We were having a party at my fraternity that night and as a pledge
with a car the brothers of the house had sent me out for cigarettes
before the party started. I went out and got the cigarettes and had to
park in a different spot when I came back because mine was taken. I
got extremely drunk at the party and ended up crashing on one of the
many couches in one of the rooms at the fraternity house for a while.
So they didn't know where I was. They being a branch of the Nazi
underground who is using the University of Rochester, Kodak, and
Bausch and Lomb, (to name a very few) as covers for their genetic and
mind control programs in order to manipulate the children of America.
"They" thought is was making a "run for it" as the
bus was driving all around Rochester, and I didn't come home that
night. When I got back to my room at about 5:00 in the afternoon Brian
is there, pissed off as hell at me asking me "Where the f*ck have
you been?... What did you do last night?" I tell him to go
"F*ck himself" and I head for the shower and then I am going
to take a long nap. When I get back from the shower, Brian is gone but
the man with the white hair "Adolph" is in my room along
with Mr. Green and about four other guys. They slam the door shut as
soon as I walk in, when I realize they are in my room I try to run,
but Adolph says a few words and I cannot move. I stand there like I am
in a trance just like I do when I am back at the lab. He starts to
chew my ass out, and all I could do is stand there and smile. I guess
they had spent the whole night following the bus around, then they
finally stopped it and searched it and found that I wasn't on the bus
and then they found the tracking device in the wheel well and then
couldn't find me, and I didn't come home. They were very pissed off at
me. I just stood there and smiled. It was one of the proudest moments
of my life! They told me to get in the god d*mn bed and to go to
f*cking sleep. So I put a big chew of tobacco in my mouth and played
Nentendo for a few hours, before finally going to bed. This is an
example of how even though I was totally under their control, they
could not totally destroy "Andy" and somehow I found a way
to come out. Then even though they had instructed me to go to bed I
some how fought the order off and went to bed when I wanted to.
At some point came the "big jump" (as if jumping off the
huge tower wasn't big enough). I don't remember exactly when it was,
but I clearly remember the event. All along, the main point of
spending so much time on all of these jumps was to see if I could make
the "big jump" and survive. The theory behind all of this
was that once the body reaches a certain speed (32feet sec/sec) you
cannot go any faster, you have reached maximum velocity. So, in theory
if I could jump off an object and reach 32 feet sec/sec and some how
survive, then it didn't matter how high I was jumping from. In other
words if I jumped off the tower (a jump of a few hundred feet) and I
reached maximum velocity then I could also jump from 500 feet, 1000
feet, or 10,000 feet. It didn't matter how high because I couldn't go
any faster. Imagine the potential of a soldier or covert operations
team who could jump out of a plane and didn't need parachutes. Think
about it! A low flying plane going over a strategic target, the enemy
would probably dismiss it as a reconnaissance plane. The team could
literately fall from the sky and land practically right on top of the
target and no one would know anything about it until months after it
was over. This is what they are after, the ultimate solider, the
ultimate killing machine.
