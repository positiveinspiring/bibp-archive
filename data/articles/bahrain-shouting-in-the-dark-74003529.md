Bahrain: An island kingdom in the Arabian
Gulf where the Shia Muslim majority are ruled by a family from the Sunni
minority.
Where people fighting for democratic rights broke the barriers of fear, only
to find themselves alone and crushed.
This is their story and Al Jazeera is their witness - the only TV
journalists who remained to follow their journey of hope to the carnage that
followed. This is the Arab revolution that was abandoned by the Arabs,
forsaken by the West and forgotten by the world.
On February 16, 2011 thousands of demonstrators hit the streets of Bahrain
to protest against
the ruling Khalifa family.
In the wake of protests in Tunisia and the revolution in Egypt, many felt
that Bahrain, too, was ready for reform. On February 21st, a
quarter of the Bahraini population came out on the streets and gathered in
the Pearl-roundabout.
Yet what followed was a brutal government crackdown on a peaceful civilian
movement, that resulted in massive killings and arrests.
