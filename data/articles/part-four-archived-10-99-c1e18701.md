PROJECT SUPERMAN
A "VICTIM" OF THE ILLUMINATI'S
SUPER-RACE PROJECTS &
MONTAUK EXPERIMENTS SPEAKS OUT
The lab instructor
grabs a second case out of the hall. It's black look identical to the
other case only smaller. He opens it and it has boxes of bullets in
it. He places five or six bullets on this little slotted plastic tray,
grabs one of the guns and proceeds to walk down to the closest
shooting station. It was a movable divider type wall (like the kind
you see in office cubicles) and had a small ledge about a foot wide on
it. We were only about ten yards away from this hanging paper target
(the kind with a black silhouette on it). The instructor then
proceeded to tell me to do exactly as he instructs. He tells me to
load the clip, insert the clip into the pistol, enter a round into the
chamber, step up to the line on the floor, envision the "red
dot" on the targets forehead and chest, raise and stiffen my arm
like a "steel beam", slowly squeeze the trigger, repeat
until all the rounds have been discharged, step back, remove the clip
from the pistol, discharge the last cartridge from the chamber, place
the clip and the pistol on the ledge and then take two steps back. He
says "do it now". I walk up to the ledge, load the clip,
insert it into the pistol, load a round into the chamber, step up to
the line, raise my arm and fire all the shots at once!.
BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!BLAM! step back, remove the clip from the pistol,
clear the last round from the chamber, place both the clip and the
pistol back on the ledge and take two steps back. This all took place
in probably under 10 seconds. I did all this just like I had done it a
thousand times before and like I knew it like the back of my hand. The
instructor comes by my side and starts lecturing me about squeezing
"gently" on the trigger and how to shoot my rounds "one
at a time and in control". I have tuned him out as I am only
focusing on the small crowd which has now gathered around the target
within a matter of seconds, and there seem to be mixed reviews about
my "performance" and a large amount of discussion is going
on. It seems I had hit the target exactly in the center of the head,
but only once. Finally, Adolph walks back and stands in front of me.
"Rhino" he says, "Why did you shoot the target once and
then deliberately waste the rest of your rounds?" he asks.
"I didn't" I answered. "Rhino, there's only one hole in
the fucking target, now answer me, WHY DID YOU DELIBERATELY MISS WITH
THE REST OF YOUR ROUNDS". "I didn't" I answer, and at
that point I remember a feeling of such pride, and such arrogance. A
feeling that I had never felt before. This feeling overwhelmed me and
I could not help but smile, and as I stood there I stuck out my chest
and in the cockiest demeanor I could muster I answered "LOOK
AGAIN!!!". Adolph is looking at me with this sort of puzzled look
on his face and turns and walks back to the target. He moves people
aside and looks at it, he turns and looks back at me, then looks at
the back of the target. He takes three steps towards me "Rhino,
there's only one.." "LOOK AGAIN!!" I yell. He walks
back to the sand bags and the group follows. They are looking for the
bullet holes. I am watching as all eyes are scanning the wall of sand
bags. I hear "here it is" and I see one of the lab
instructors stick his finger into one of the sand bags. There is still
puzzlement and confusion amongst the group. They can find only one
bullet hole. Finally, I see the man with the white hair pull out his
pocket knife and cuts into the sand bag. I cannot see what is going on
as the group closes around him, but all of a sodden I hear this ROAR
of approval from the crowd, and Adolph emerges from the crowd with his
hand out stretched and something is on his palm. He approaches me and
there is a small pile of bullets in his palm. "You shot all your
rounds through the same hole didn't you?" "Of course? It's
what you told me to do?" I answer. And as I answer the ROAR
erupts again.
I remember standing there, feeling very proud of myself, yet at the
same time feeling very puzzled. "What are they so excited
about?" I was asking myself. To me, it was as easy as taking the
cap off a ball point pen and putting it back on really fast five
times. Simple, a child could do it. What was all the hoopla about? I
had absolutely no clue.
For the rest of the night I repeated this from all possible distances,
angles, and firing positions. I was so fast with the firing procedure
they had five or six stations all set up and I had to wait for them to
examine the results and reset the targets etc... I would load it, fire
it, remove the clip or spent cartridges, place everything back onto
the shelves exactly as I had the first time and move onto the next
spot. I was in heaven, ever since the fifth or sixth grade I had been
really into all the "really cool" stuff that you weren't
supposed to have as an upper middle class kid (in total secrecy from
my mother of course).
Chinese martial arts weapons, Chinese throwing stars, numb-chucks,
brass knuckles with spikes etc.. My mother hated, and I mean hated
guns. I was not allowed to have ANY toy guns as a child what so ever,
no bee-bee guns, no toy guns, not even any plastic guns. I wasn't even
allowed to play like I was shooting anyone (cops and robbers, cowboys
and Indians) when I was a child. When Atari came out, my mother hated
even the idea that I was shooting something in a video game (space
invaders), as a result she simply would not allow me to play certain
games and she would not allow me to have them (I would play them
anyway just over at a friends house). When I was in high school and
Nintendo came out she would not allow me to buy the plastic gun which
hooked into the game so I could play "duck hunt" or some
police game. When we would go to buy games she simply said "it's
my money and I will not buy that game for you." I wanted
"the road warrior" or something and she wanted me to get
"tennis" or "bass fishing" "you used to love
to go fishing" she would say. She really was something. With my
father coming back from Vietnam a different man and having severe
mental anguish about what happened over there and the whole
experience, and after what happened to Mr. Johnson I can't really
blame her for her gun hysteria, I can only try to understand. BUT
ANYWAY, here I was, a 19 year old kid and all of a sudden I got to
fire all these these "really cool" guns, and they had all
this "really cool" stuff like knives, killing wires, night
vision goggles, and all of these ADULTS were running around as fast as
they could for ME. Running around, changing targets for ME, getting ME
a sandwich or a drink and they all seemed so eager to do something for
me, anything, anything I asked, anything I wanted they would run and
get for me. They seemed so impressed with what I could do, I sensed
they envied me, I also sensed they feared me. I felt like a celebrity,
and I felt like a king.
All of the shooting took only about an hour or so I would estimate.
After the first round, they never told me any of the results. All I
remember is the atmosphere had a feeling of elation, euphoria,
exuberance, everyone had these HUGE smiles on there faces, laughing,
and admiration. Honestly, as we got further and further back, I don't
even know if I was hitting ANYTHING! All I remember is raising my arm
and firing the pistol. I COULDN'T THINK, I COULD ONLY DO. I would just
fire the pistol at the target, step back, and they were always for
some reason happier than pigs in shit.
The thing is they liked me. If the atmosphere seemed "light"
I somehow found myself suddenly speaking and making comments for no
particular reason. When I spoke everyone would freeze and listen. I
liked this fact, I liked it very much. I would make comments like
"Should we be wasting all these bullets? There very expensive
aren't they?" (my mothers' mother, the very frugal Grandma
Angrstrom coming out of me). And they would all start laughing
hysterically.
I remember Mr. Green saying to me with a tear in his eye from laughing
so hard "Rhino, you can shoot as many god d*mn f*cking bullets as
you want. It's on me and I'm buying. Shit! I'll get you bullets by the
f8cking truck load if you want." I said "Really? Are you
sure cause that can really start to add up!" and they all burst
out laughing again.
After that comment is what I most remember specifically about this
whole episode. I remember watching Mr. Green as he turned to someone
in a long dark overcoat and saying "I f*ckin like that kid.. I
f*ckin like him! I like how he thinks! as a matter of fact" and
he turns and motions the man with the white hair and black leather
coat over to him and a few others join him. The man with the white
hair then says "Rhino, come over here." I walk over and he
says "Rhino, let me first tell you that you did an outstanding
job, and as a reward we are going to send you home early tonight. I
want you to go home and get a good nights rest, you've earned
it." I said "awesome, thank you very much." Mr. Green
then pats me on the back and says "outstanding son, f*cking
outstanding!" This was the first time Mr. Green had physically
touched me and I remember the "eerie" feeling I got and the
"chills" that went down my spine as he removed his hand from
my back. I walked over to the wall and picked my coat off the floor
and followed the two men who always drove me out to the car. Then I
remember being in front of the dorm and I actually said "good
by" to the two guys and went inside to bed.
Most of all I remember the proud feeling of amazing them with my
shooting even though I don't know exactly how I did it. I remember the
feeling of being "honored" with a reward because I could
somehow do things none of them could do. And most of all I remember
the "eerie" feeling of Mr. Green touching me. He had always
been there and I had seen him many times, but for some reason now in
my mind he finally had become all too real. If that makes any sense?
After that they then instructed me with rifles, more pistols,
basically every practical thing that shot a bullet I was instructed in
how to use it, clean it, shoot it, and kill with it. And as soon as
the instructor was finished I instantly knew it all like the back of
my hand, like I had done it a thousand times before. I remember
feeling the differences between the M-16 and the AK47 as I shot them.
Shooting small semi-automatic weapons (like an uzi only different).
Then asking me to remember which weapons I personally liked the most.
They converted the longest hallway into a target range since it was
the longest stretch in the facility, by placing sand bags all the way
at one end and blocking off all other door ways and hall ways along
the way. I would estimate it was about 70 yards + or - long. In doors
this shot seemed very distant. They also had converted the original
range to have these "pop-up" targets, as well as moving ones
which ran along this miniature track. The targets would come out of
this temporary wall, go across the line of sight on the track and then
disappear into the other wall, and they had tracks going at different
distances, coming to and going away etc. For the next while it seemed
that all I did was shoot. All the other experiments seemed to have
been put on hold. The exercising, the brain games, the puzzles, the
punching bag, everything.
I could hit ANY target still or moving, at ANY range, with ANY of the
guns in the exact center every time. Except for some reason I remember
having some trouble with the semi-automatic type stuff, because the
gun was not designed for accuracy it was designed for speed. So it
would fire so fast the distribution pattern just wasn't accurate
enough. And by not accurate enough I mean instead of having one bullet
hole in which all the spent rounds would pass through in the exact
center of the red dot (which the targets now came with already painted
on). The semi-automatics would basically just eliminate the entire red
dot which was the size of a half dollar if I emptied the clip in one
burst. This was basically still an unbelievable bulls-eye and show of
marksmanship, but it was not what they wanted. They wanted every
bullet through the same hole every time, all the time. In the exact
center of the red dot, no exceptions, and no excuses. So they backed
off using these guns for the time period.
At close range I could do this without any problem I would estimate
under 20 yards. The further I backed away the larger the single bullet
hole would become. As I backed as far back as I could go on the long
range (60 or 70 yards), the bullet hole had gone from being about the
size of a "dime" to being about the size of a
"quarter". I remember after I shot they would gather around
the target at the other end and then yell for me. I would run down,
and see one hole the size of a quarter in the red dot on the head, and
this "rush" of pride would run through my body. But when
they spoke to me it was not praise, they were screaming at me with
criticism. "WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, YOU CALL THAT SHOOTING, GO
BACK AND DO IT AGAIN, AND I WANT TO SEE ONE HOLE THE SIZE OF A DIME
NOT THE SIZE OF A FUCKING GOLFBALL. DO YOU UNDERSTAND." I would
have to go back and do it again. I remember some improvement but then
I would worsen again. They sent me home early anyway to get some rest.
They were pushing me and my limits. Yes I was doing incredible things
but they wanted to see just how far I could go and just what I could
do.
The helmet of knowledge- Everything was going very well with my
conditioning and my training. Mr. Green and Adolph seemed pleased with
my progress. Until we began shooting outside. It all seemed different
now. With the cold air on my face I felt more "awake" and
more aware of what was going on. The pistol no longer felt like an
extension of my own hand. It felt cold and seemed to be heavier now.
When I shot as the distances got greater and greater I became worse
and worse and began to miss. And by miss I mean being on the edge of
the red circle not in the exact middle, hitting the black, missing the
black but still hitting the paper. My "automatic
adjustments" for wind and distance didn't seem to work very well
if at all. One night it was very windy and raining and I was missing
the red dot, and I even missed the target all together a few times.
This is with a pistol (I think it was, or was very similar to a
Beretta). They bring me back inside and give me an "ass
chewing" about my very poor performance. They send me back to the
lab where I do "simple things" for the rest of the evening.
Like the squat rack, more brain puzzles, strength exercises etc.
The next night as I'm walking into the lab Adolph instructs me to
follow and we proceed to a room that I had never been in before. It is
like an empty class room, there are green black boards on the walls up
at the front, one green black board which can flip around and is on
wheels off to the right and one student desk in the middle of the
room. That is all. They tell me to sit and I do. I become very nervous
as I'm thinking they are going to test me or something and I haven't
studied. A man in a baby blue lab coat walks to the front. I do not
recognize him. There is a nervous tone in his voice as he begins.
I have no idea what is going to go on as this format is all new to me.
He begins talking about angular trajectories, muzzle velocities, and
how air densities are measured verses altitude at sea level and this
then equates into a friction coefficient equations to measure the
angular trajectory of a projectile! And he goes on and on. "HOLD
IT" I speak out. "Can I have a pencil and some paper to make
some notes?" I ask. For the next while I'm frantically bent over
the desk and trying to write down everything he is saying and copy the
diagrams he is drawing on the board like I'm in class back in school.
After a while Adolph walks over to me and says "Rhino, do you
need a break?" "YES I need a f*cking break" and I slam
my pencil down and put my head between my hands. "Are you getting
all of this?" he asks me. "NO" I answer, and I remember
starting to cry "I'm trying, really I'm trying, but I DON'T HAVE
A F*CKING CLUE ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT!". We take
a break. I'm very nervous about having to go back into the room. I had
gotten a "D" in algebra in high school and they are talking
about stuff I had never even herd of before, and they want me to
understand this stuff, there is no f*cking way I'm thinking to
myself.
They call me back in and for the first time I felt sort of
"scared". Not over where I was, who I was with, what they
did to me in the lab. I was scared about letting then down. I was
scared because I had convinced myself that no matter what happened I
could not do this. I was never a good student in school and this
stuff, forget it. There was just no way!
As I sit back down I'm looking for the man in the blue lab coat and he
is no longer there. It is only the man with the white hair. He says a
few words and I become relaxed and I close my eyes. I hear him. He
tells me to "just relax" and "just sit back and absorb
like a giant sponge, just absorb everything." I hear the
instructor begin speaking again and this goes on for a while. I hear
Adolph ask me is any of this sinking in?" and I shake my head and
answer "NO" and open my eyes. As I open my eyes I look to my
right and see the man with the white hair and Mr. Green speaking to
each other in a fairly loud tone. Not arguing but clearly annoyed. I
put my head in my hands again and then stand out of my chair and yell
"HOLD IT, I have an idea!" I was so proud of my self. The
man with the white hair comes over and asks "What's your
idea?" with this cautious look on his face (I remember his look
of caution). "take me to my LEVEL, take me to my ROOM. I have an
idea!" "What are you going to do?" he asks.
"PLEASE, JUST TAKE ME TO MY ROOM" I say. "Rhino"
he says "I have to know what you are going to do."
"I'll explain everything in a minute! just please take me to my
room, trust me, you're gonna LOVE this!" I said.
When I opened my eyes I explained what I had done in my special room
in my mind.
What I had done was this. In the main room of my mind (the big blue
room with the 20 foot ceilings) on the far wall was the circuit
breaker for my nerve endings (like the fuse box in your house). This
device allowed me to turn my nerves on and off at will mentally just
by flipping the circuit when needed. Next to that was the adrenaline
valve which allowed me to turn on and off my adrenaline flow to my
body. It was simply a thin copper pipe which came out of the wall ,
came down and went back into the wall again with a valve in the middle
of it like the main water valve in the basement of your house which
controls the water flow coming from the street into the house (the
same thing only I was controlling the flow of adrenaline and not the
flow of water and it was for control of my body not for control of the
house). Allowing me to turn my adrenaline gland on and off at will.
Next to it was the fear switch. It was this big old fashioned circuit
breaker type switch which was chained in the "off" position
with a "DO NOT TOUCH" sign on it. They had ALREADY
conditioned me to install these devices back in "room 101"
and this is how I had configured them in my mind.
What I did was next to the fear switch I created this big metal box.
It was my own personal super computer which was connected directly to
the root of my mind, the root of my essence, and the root of my soul.
Any information that was entered into this computer would become
instantly part of ME, and part of my soul. The computer had unlimited
memory and unlimited speed. It was the fastest and most top secret
computer in the world. The information will go directly from the
source to the core of my essence, like writing in stone but with a
blank slab. My mind now is open for all instruction and there is
unlimited space. "HOW DO WE ENTER THE INFORMATION?" The man
with the white hair, Adolph asks. "That's the best part" I
say. And I proceed to tell them that what I have done is created my
own lab in my mind. It is a new room located next to the healing pool.
And in this room there is nothing but the biggest and most comfortable
reclining black leather lazy boy that can be made. Next to the lazy
boy is a small wooden stand. On the wooden stand is the wonder of my
creation, I call it "the helmet of knowledge". It is a
football helmet, but there is no facemask. On the top of the helmet
are wires which run through the helmet and connect to little metal
conductors which touch my skull when I put the helmet on. There are
also goggles (like ski goggles) which have the metal probes around the
temples and eyes. The wires run from the top of the helmet and then
are bundled into this one inch thick gray 'super conducting' wire.
The wire runs from the helmet out the doorway and back into the main
room. Then over to the wall and hooks directly into the front of the
super computer. The information then is transferred into the super
computer. The super computer then processes it and sends it out the
back wire (which is identical to the wire from the helmet). The
information goes out the back wire and goes directly into the blue
wall, directly into ME. "SO EXACTLY HOW DO WE ENTER THE
INFORMATION?" The man with the white hair asks again. "Don't
you get it! All I have to do is lay back and relax in the chair and
put "the helmet of knowledge" on with the goggles and
ANYTHING you want me to understand you just have to speak it! It's
like writing computer code on my brain, AND THE BEST PART IS ALL I
HAVE TO DO IS LAY BACK IN THE LAZY BOY BECAUSE IT'S ALL DONE
AUTOMATICALLY!.. PRETTY F*CKING 'COOL' ISN'T IT!!!!!" The man with
the white hair and Mr. Green just look at each other and from the
expressions on there faces I knew I had just blown them away. And like
an idiot I sat there feeling so f*cking proud of myself for thinking
of the helmet of knowledge, and for winning the game and outsmarting
them again.
I had given them a way to insert ANYTHING they wanted DIRECTLY into
the core of my brain. This could not be undone and this could not be
changed, and this could not be disobeyed. They could now write the
code of my existence anyway they wanted to, and they could now tell me
to do anything and I had no choice but to obey. This was going beyond
hypnosis, and complex suggestions and conditioning. This was giving
them a blank screen and a keypad to rewrite the core of my essence.
After explaining the helmet of knowledge though I hadn't told them
everything. Not out of fear of them or because I was trying to hid
anything from them, it was simply because they never asked. They never
asked about the back up system I had also installed in my mind. What I
did was I had split the thick gray wire after it left the helmet of
knowledge and I rerouted the second wire to the second super computer
I had created. I was thinking "I'll probably screw something up
sooner or later" so I made a back up copy and the back up systems
for ME to hide my screw ups from them, just in case.
What I did was I placed one of those fold out lunch tables directly IN
THE HEALING POOL (I had to expand the room and the pool for this but
since this was my mind I could make the rooms and the pools as big as
I wanted so I gave my self plenty of room within the room within my
mind if you follow). But anyway, I then placed the second computer
(the back up) on the table which was in the healing pool, and ran the
wire through the pool and the water. In essence what I had done was
created a totally self sufficient independent circuit for the back up
system and I also hooked the other systems to the back up system (the
fear circuit, the healing circuit, the adrenaline circuit, and the
pain circuits) and ran those wires through the pool as well. So if
anything happened to the main room or the main computer I would ALWAYS
have a "back up" copy of everything.
Even if the main room was somehow destroyed or damaged beyond repair
the back up computer would kick in. AND if the back up computer became
damaged it would fall off the table and right into the healing pool,
thus automatically regenerating itself, and thus automatically
regenerating the main room again as well from the copy stored in the
back up computer which can never be destroyed because it's over the
healing pool, and if you try and destroy the healing pool one if not
both of the computer's would regenerate it anyway. The only way to
destroy everything was to destroy both computers and the healing pool
at the same time, but since I didn't tell anyone about the backup they
would never know to do this. Of course, just in case, I made a door
for the healing pool room that was indestructible and would
automatically close within one millionth of a second if I pushed the
panic alarm (which then of course had to be wired into every room
along with the panic buttons themselves) or the door would close the
millisecond any damage occurred to the main computer. There was also a
super secret third computer which I hooked up to the back of the back
up in the healing pool room. I then instructed the blue wall (which is
the actual walls of my mind, the whole room is my mind if that makes
any sense) to reach out and absorb the third computer. To hide it
somewhere, and this was just between me and him. And the blue wall
reached out like the blob and took the third computer and stuck it
some where. I honestly really don't know where it went. But I do think
it's part of the reason I can still remember these events today.
After I had explained the helmet of knowledge to Mr. Green and Adolph
they placed me under again to try out the helmet and the instructor
begins again. When I open my eyes the man with the white hair asks how
I feel and my response I think was something like "It's all so
simple, it's all so clear now!". They immediately take me out
side to the range and I remember walking to the 100 yard marker,
loading my pistol and firing the entire clip in rapid succession,
unload the clip remove the last cartridge from the chamber and placed
them both on this little stand next to the marker. Mr. Green and
Adolph start walking toward the target and tell me to follow. They are
walking so fast that I have to hurry as to not walk too far behind. As
I look ahead there is a man in a baby blue lab coat already up there
looking at it. When we get there they stop on front of the target and
I cannot see what I had hit. They part and Mr. Green says "That's
better but I want that hole the size of a f*cking dime! why isn't that
hole the size of a f*cking dime?" and I look at the target and
there is a hole right in the middle of the red dot on the forehead a
little larger then the size of a quarter (almost enveloping the entire
red dot). As I am looking at the target I stand tall and stick my
chest out. I have no idea exactly what I said but I just seemed to
flow out of me with out me thinking about it. I said something like
"a non uniformity in the casing of the bullet of one thousandth
of an inch in combination with as little as a thousandth of a gram of
powder deviation per cartridge results in friction loss and deviance
of muzzle velocity and this when multiplied over a distance of 100
yards the result is a deviation of the projectiles path of 1/8 of an
inch up to 3/4 of an inch depending on air temperature and wind
velocity at the time of discharge, SIR." Again I have no idea
what exactly came out of my mouth but it was the physics equations the
man in the baby blue lab coat was trying to teach me in the class
room. "Go back and get your gun" the man with the white hair
instructed me. And as I am jogging back to the marker I look back over
my shoulder I see them talking. I feel nervous, I get my gun and run
back. As I arrive I hear them laughing but as I get closer the
laughing stops. Mr. Green tells me I have shown improvement and he
sends me home for the night. I can tell he was pleased.
What I didn't know at the time was the helmet of knowledge turned out
to be a major breakthrough. After that anything they wanted to put
into my head they could now do directly into the core of my brain with
ease. They even got me a black leather recliner to lay in when I was
laying in the one in my mind using the helmet of knowledge.
Run like a cheetah- After they got me the chair, I was a different
person. It's difficult to explain, but until then, all the experiments
and all the training was like walking in a dream. What ever they told
me to do I would just not questioning it at all. Not thinking, just
doing. Now for some reason it was like riding in someone else's body.
If that makes any sense? Seeing what's happening yet you cannot move.
Being sort of aware what's happening, yet having no control to stop
it. When they told me to do something I would object but have no
control to do anything about it. On the inside somehow I would be
screaming "NO, you bastards I won't do it" but couldn't stop
my self. I would raise my arm and fire the pistol anyway, or crush the
skull of a cat with my bare hand that was a hydraulic vice with
unlimited power. If that makes any sense.
I don't know exactly what they did to me, but I remember suddenly
being able to "run as fast as a cheetah", as fast as I
needed to run. Being able to "leap like a gazelle" and
easily being able to traverse any obstacle with ease. Having the
feeling of being a "puma" as I stalked my victim with
patience, stealth, and cat like reflexes, totally camouflaged in the
tall grass yet patiently waiting for the moment to pounce. Of course
also being able to "climb like a monkey." Any object, no
matter how tall or smooth, I can figure a way to get up there. Without
any hesitation and without any fear. They instilled these attributes
directly into my mind and into my personality using the helmet of
knowledge. Anything these animals could do, I could do, only better,
because I was "the Rhino", unstoppable and undefeatable. I
could ANYTHING, ANYTHING they asked me to do, I could do, because the
perfect killing machine was "THE Rhino". And for some reason
I was very proud of this fact.
I remember riding in a car on a very lonely road. There are fields and
groups of trees on both sides of the road, it is night and there are
no other cars or people to be seen anywhere. The car stops and they
tell me to get out and start jogging. As I began to run I remember the
head lights coming up from behind me and the sound of the engine
suddenly bursting forward with power, as I hear the car coming to run
me over. And then the "rush" would kick in again. That
feeling of running for your life. When your heart starts to pound and
the adrenaline starts to flow. When the instinct takes over and you
don't look back, you get tunnel vision, and all you think about is
faster, faster, faster. I don't know how fast I was running but I
remember them yelling from the car "Run Rhino, Run like a
cheetah" and after words I hear their jokes about how they should
put me in the Olympics and bet money on me because what I was doing
was not "Humanly impossible". Again I don't know how fast I
was running when they were running me down with the car, but when I
was back on the sixth grade soccer team at 12 years old the key to my
success was my speed. When the coaches video taped the games (with a
Beta camcorder) they told me, and I saw that I had a 6 yard stride at
12 years old. Then as a senior in high school watching film I had over
a 9 yard stride. When I tested in football BOTH senior year in high
school and freshman year in college when I ran the 40 yard dash BOTH
times the coaches made me run it again because the times must be
wrong. Something must be wrong because that's not right they would
say, that's not possible. In high school the coach thought I was
cheating and only running 35 yards and he made me run it 5 times. Even
as the other kids ran in between my runs when I got to the line and
ran my time he would run back and accuse me of cheating and running
from the wrong line. Even with the other kids swearing that I wasn't
cheating he called the whole team a bunch of liars. Finally on my
sixth run, and after I had "felt" my self getting slower
(given up mentally and after the most important thing in the world to
you, the football coaches approval, tells you enough times that you
cannot do something you finally begin to believe it), he gave me a
time of 4.85. A time which he was satisfied that I could run and that
was the time he gave me (he was a real ass-hole).
This was the first day of football camp senior year in high school.
Coach Doug Parcells (who is the younger brother of Bill Parcells who
is currently the head coach of the New York Jets) had taken a physical
education teaching position at a Ramsey elementary school and then was
also going to coach the offensive and defensive line for the Ramsey
high school football team (this was in 1987). As he arrived as a new
coach going into my senior year in high school during the summer
weight lifting workouts he was amazed at my strength. In the fall as
camp ended and the season began and repeatedly asked coach Hyman (he
was the ass-hole who had benched me and tried to throw me off the team
for telling him "don't worry coach, everything would be all right
between you and your wife." This was when he was being an
ass-hole to everyone in the school two years earlier, and called the
whole team a bunch of liars refusing to believe my 40 time, and
wouldn't even tell me the times I was running, he would just call me a
cheater and tell me to run it again and when the steroid trial came he
was there and never said a word in my defense). Why isn't Andy a
captain? Parcells asked. He's pound for pound the best blocker I've
ever coached, and he's the best defensive player I've ever seen. And
the smugness of Hyman finally aired it's ugly head. Parcells tried to
tell Hyman that he recognized that I had a certain mental condition
(of course the name escapes me). Where when some kids growing up have
such superior abilities to all the other kids in a given area whether
it be sports, mathematics, or musical talent. These kids have such
natural abilities that for some reason they can literally "blow
any one else away at will" but they don't because they want to be
liked by everyone else. They want to "fit in" and be like
everyone else. They want to have friends, and not have everyone
jealous of what they can do. So they unconsciously don't do their
best, they can do much if better if they really wanted to, but they
don't. He recognized this in me almost instantly when everyone else
for years would give me the cold shoulder from Hyman's verbal slander
over the years.
It's funny because when coach Parcells was talking to the Penn State
Football staff about my football abilities he also said to them
"You have to be very careful what you say when you are around
Andy, because anything you tell him to do he literally will do to the
letter and I mean to the letter, and if you give him some kind of
unsolvable problem, days later he will come back and blow your mind
with some kind of a solution, so you just have to be careful what you
say when your around him."
The same thing happened in college, when I ran my first 40 at
Rochester, as I crossed the line the coach said "run it again
Pero, because you sure as hell didn't run that time" AND AGAIN
THEY MADE ME RUN MY 40, FOUR TIMES BEFORE GIVING ME A TIME 4.89.
Having a coach run back to the goal line to watch my start, and after
I ran I would have to turn around and do it again because it just
didn't make any sense. The point is I already had speed, and with the
conditioning in my mind I became so unbelievably fast it was
supposedly not possible. They chased me in the car several times and
the one time Mr. Green was in the car and after we had stopped and
everyone got out I remember them talking, and the gist of the
conversations were "do you f*cking believe that?" and I
remember Mr. Green personally saying "that's f*cking
unbelievable!" Which gave me great satisfaction. Again, playing
the game, I had won again.
The assassin rifle- It was day time and they bring me to this huge
long field and tell me that we are going to be having "rifle
practice." I was deadly, the M-16 up to 400+ yards, and my pistol
100+ yards. The rule of thumb they gave me was anything over 100 yards
I was to shoot with the rifle and aim for the chest, 100 yards and
under I could use the pistol and aim for the head. For some reason I
preferred going for the head with the pistol. These two numbers seem
to stick in my head as far as distances. Anyway, they always seemed
disappointed with my rifle shooting for some reason.
When we get to the field, they open the trunk of the car and there are
5 or 6 of these "cases" and as I stood there and watched
they open these "cases" and inside are these huge rifles,
and everyone starts assembling them except me, I just stood there. I
knew what those things were used for. Assassinations was the only
answer. Somewhere inside me I said "there gonna want me to kill
someone" and I knew that if I shot well what other answer could
there be, and thinking to myself "I want no part of this you
f*cking son's of bitches". AT THAT MOMENT IS WHEN THIS ALL WAS NO
LONGER A GAME TO ME, I FINALLY REALIZED WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS WERE. I
became filled with panic and wanted to run away but I could not move.
I wanted to scream but could not. The lab coat guy who instructed me
initially in my weapons lesson, starts to explain to me about these
high powered rifles. After about a half an hour they have me choose
one and have a target setup about 1200 yards away. I think they did
some "prep" work using the helmet of knowledge because as
soon as I saw it I knew what it was and how to use it, the half an
hour was basically just a review. After all the prep work I began
shooting. I would shoulder the rifle, line up the cross hairs and fire
the weapon. When I shot the weapon I began missing, and by missing I
mean missing the target all together. Mr. Green gets in my face and
starts screaming to do better, I cannot do any better, and he gets in
my face again. I tried to explain to him why I couldn't shoot the
assassin rifle. I explained to him that when I shot the pistol or a
"regular rifle" that I didn't aim with the gun, yes I would
shoulder the weapon but I aimed with my mind not with the gun sight. I
had to see the target with my own eyes and then I shot automatically
with out thinking. With the assassin rifle the key to it was this huge
scope, and when I looked through it, it was somehow different, and I
said that I was sorry but I just couldn't do it! To this day I have
never seen a grown man throw such a temper tantrum, he was absolutely
livid, and freaking out with rage. And he gets in my face and begins
to scream at me again. "I'm sorry I just can't do it!" I
answer. "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T IS NOT IN YOUR
VOCABULARY!" he screams. I just stepped back "I'm sorry I
just can't do it, that's not how it works" and I proceed to go
back into how I aim with my mind not with the gun and he cuts me off
"F*CK! now what are we going to do?" and the four or five
men gather off to my right. The thing is as I stood there and I could
not move and I could not speak without their specific instruction. But
I was thinking to my self "I was right! I was right about the
gun" and I wouldn't say it was fear that came over me, but it was
more like panic. "I was right! I was right about the gun"
and when they came back over to me the man with the white hair makes
me look him in the eyes and he asks me "are you sure you can't
shoot the rifle". I knew that if properly induced I could have
come up with something by using the helmet of knowledge, but somehow
and from somewhere inside me I found the strength to hold my tongue
and I answered "YES, I AM SURE"! He accepted the answer and
went back to the group. I felt a surge of power as I had fought back
somehow and won. We pack up and get back in the car and start driving.
That's all I remember about the assassin rifles.
Another place- After the assign rifle didn't go as they had planned, I
don't think they quite knew what to do with me. I remember getting on
an F-16 jet at the Rochester airport. I remember this because I am not
one for amusement parks (the spin rides make me sick to my stomach).
When I got on the F-16 the pilot checks to see if they have strapped
me in and he tells me to "Hold on to your butt" and we get
immediate clearance to take off. He hits the throttle. Let me tell you
if you know the feeling of acceleration you get when a 747 takes off.
Imagine that feeling 10 times more powerful, easily. It was like being
strapped to a run away jet rocket. My stomach never caught up to me as
I had left it back on the run way. The pilot is yelling "YAH
HOO" and starts to do some "S" turns. That's when I
lost it. I threw up all over my self and the whole inside of the
plane. I have never seen someone so pissed off as the pilot was at me
for throwing up in the plane.
We land some hours later on an air base some where. The terrain is
South Western (desert with some hills and mountains, and some cactuses
growing on the ground). The next thing I remember is being introduced
to a group of men. It was some kind of covert team, about twelve men
they had on black t-shits and camouflage pants. They had set up the
exact same course that I had run back when they had killed the girl.
As of yet no one had been able to come close to completing it. The man
with the white hair tells me to take off my shirt and to start doing
push ups. Then to start on the course. I cannot make it up the 90
degree vertical climb (the first part). The man with the white hair
goes and gets a gun and threatens to shoot me. That is when the
"rush" kicks in. And I scurry up the obstacle and run
through the course. I even do the jump without any assistance ropes.
And land on the thick mats they had set up. The key to my abilities
was not the hypnosis, it was when I felt my life was in danger then my
adrenaline would "kick in". I would then get the
"rush" and the "tunnel vision". This when in
combination with the army training and the hypnosis is what made it
the deadly combination.
They trained me in all the different "Hand to Hand" killing
techniques, schooled me in everything and I knew it all the first time
"like the back of my hand." They tried to work me into the
"team" as one of the members. I remember training for a
specific mission. My role was to get up this 90 degree obstacle to the
fourth floor balcony and secure a rope for the rest of the team to
then climb up. I remember practicing it over and over again. But when
it came time to run the mission the army had built the obstacle out of
6" logs, when we got to the building it was made of smooth black
marble. This gave me some trouble but I got up it eventually. Once
every one was up the rope then we went inside. I don't remember what
we were after but I do remember shooting a guard when I wasn't
supposed to. I saw him coming closer and I shot him. I guess I
endangered the mission and the rest of the team. I COULD NOT THINK, I
COULD ONLY DO.
After that I remember several more times getting into the F-16 and
getting out, but no trip in the middle only getting in and getting
out. I think they put me to sleep or something after I had thrown up
the first time. I remember it being night, cold and snowing in
Rochester and waking up on an aircraft carrier in the middle of the
ocean where it's warm and sunny. Then I believe they would sent me off
on the mission and then have me back before the weekend was over. In
actuality they could have done this at any time because there is no
attendance policy at the University of Rochester (at least the classes
I was taking at the time) and no one would have missed me if I had
"disappeared" for a few days. It is actually quite clever
because they could have flown me, theoretically, almost anywhere in
the world in 12 hours by F-16, I wake up feeling "totally
refreshed" like I had slept for days, I go off for four hours and
do my killing, and then they put me back on a plane back to Rochester
and have me back in 30 hours.
After I had "screwed up" the first mission, from then on
they sent me in alone. I remember spending countless hours in the
"helmet of knowledge" going over and over the mission. They
put every detail into my head.
I REMEMBER them telling me that I was to go and kill this man. And I
would not do it. I said "what has this man done to me personally,
Nothing! I will not kill him!" They would come back and say that
this man "kills women and children, that he tortures young girls
to death and then rapes them, he murders babies and he butchers
grandmothers for fun! You must kill this man to save the people that
he is killing! He is evil, and must be stopped and only you can save
the people of his country from him." That was the only way they
could get me to kill, was to tell me that this man was a butcher and
how he did awful things to the people around him. After they told me
that, I had no choice, it was like they made me feel like it was my
duty and the whole world was depending on me to do it.
I remember completing several assassination missions. I don't know who
they were, how I got there, where I was or why specifically I was
doing it. I remember shooting several people in the head several
times, stopping to reload and shooting him some more. They had told me
to "terminate with extreme hostility" and I did. The thing
is I COULD NOT THINK I COULD ONLY DO, so all the planning and all
preparation work would go out the window if something went wrong, if
something didn't go exactly according to plan then "all hell
would break loose". For example if there were four guards at a
certain point and there were only supposed to be two. Or if an area
was supposed to be dark and it was light. Some how I would
"snap" and just start shooting everyone. Everyone became the
enemy and I had no way of distinguishing between who was foe and who
was friendly. I remember one time when my helicopter came to get me,
they had a spot light on me and I started shooting at them. I think I
killed several of my own people.
They tried to fix this by giving me a helmet camera and an ear piece
but still I freaked out at some point on all my missions. I
specifically remember asking them "How many missions do I have to
run before you will let me go?" The man with the white hair told
me "10 missions Rhino, after you run 10 missions you then become
retired and we will let you go."
I can only remember going on 4 missions specifically. One of which as
we were flying away in the helicopter after they had picked me up, one
of the men who had volunteered to be the gun man on the helicopter was
shot and killed from the ground. He was the man I had pushed out of
the tank of water back in the lab, and the only one who had been
"Nice" to me at all. These "assassinations" were
all done (I think) between the years 1988 and 1992. The FBI is looking
currently for me but the Illuminati have deprogrammed me, "erased
my memory" if you will. As I slowly regain the scraps of my
memories more and more of the pieces fall onto place. However, as the
story unfolds I will add most of the reverent details at the end as
not to complicate the two parallel time lines.
I clearly remember the complexes, the types of uniform the men were
wearing (some wore business suits, some had turbans on their heads,
others had these funny hats on), and of course I remember shooting
many of the guards and several of the "target" men in the
head several times and stopping only when they had no head left to
shoot. Then I would just get the "hell out of there"
shooting everything in sight that moved. The problem was I didn't know
when to stop, who was "friendly" and who was not, because I
had my "tunnel vision" on. I was just running, running for
my life. I could not think I could only do!
May 1989- All during, and especially at the end of my freshmen year I
remember Brian giving me a lot of grief about what I was going to do
with my semester breaks. He would ask me where I was going and what I
would be doing (thanksgiving break, Christmas and Easter breaks as
well). When it came time for school to end he kept after me to stay up
in Rochester. He told me that him and some of his friends were getting
a house and I could stay "rent free". "Don't go
home" he would say. "This is your new home" he said. I
told him I was going home to New Jersey and no thank you. The thing is
a always remember my mom's friend "Astrid" always being at
our house at some point when I came home from college. She would
always ask me "So how do you feel" and I would always tell
her "fine".
I worked 12 hour days that summer painting houses, and I was living
with my mother in Ramsey New Jersey. But still I worked out as best as
I could.
September 1989- (Sophomore year) I am living in the Fraternity house
as my place of residence for my sophomore year. I had broken up with
my long time girlfriend of 7 years during the summer. About six weeks
into sophomore year I meet "Carrie Savage". She is a junior
at Rochester. She is in the top 5% of her class and is a Biology and
German major. She is a pre med. student. She is half Polish and half
German. She is also a German tutor, and teaches German on the side for
extra money. She had spent a year overseas in high school in Germany
and her mother had sponsored a German student (who was Carrie's
boyfriend when she was over there) for a year in their house.
She comes up to me at a party, and we start to talk, I ask her out to
dinner. As it turns out she has a very mean streak in her and when she
drank she became very nasty (her father was as alcoholic so when she
drank she became a very mean drunk).
During this year I remember several trips to the airport and there was
a F-16 waiting for me. I remember getting out of the F-16 one time and
it was just about time for one of the semester breaks because the
Rochester airport is very small and only has a few gates. As I walked
off the tarmac into the gate, some girls who knew me were yelling to
get my attention and I walked right by them with two men on either
side of me in long overcoats. Not even acknowledging their presence.
I don't remember very many more "Lab" episodes during this
time, that doesn't mean that they didn't occur. I just don't remember
them, but I do remember going to the airport a lot. And getting in an
F-16 jet and getting out somewhere else. Whether it be the
"Other" facility in the South West, or on an aircraft
carrier I remember getting out in these two different places. I also
remember some friends asking me "where the hell have I been the
last few days". This question came up a lot that year.
I remember my friends Nick and Bob were telling me "Andy, who is
fucking with your mind. Andy, are you all right, tell us who is
messing with you? ARE YOU OK?" Then I remember walking into my
fraternity house, and as soon as you walk in there is a big room right
to the right (called the Wilson room) and the whole fraternity is
facing me and the man with the white hair has a little shiny ball in a
string and is swinging it back and forth right in front of them and
they all have a blank look on their faces. I stop in the hall way the
man with the white hair tells me to just go up to my room, and I do.
After that everyone seems normal and no one said a word about it.
I remember asking Nick and Bob if they remember the conversations we
had had about me and they didn't remember a thing about it.
December 1989- I go home to New Jersey during the Christmas break. I
needed to earn some money so I am looking through the local paper and
there is an add for a parking Valet paying $10.00 - $12.00 an hour.
Down at the Ho-Ho-Kus Inn. (a 5 star restaurant owned by a group of
local Doctors). The ad said to send of fax resume to Dr. Purizzo and
it gave a phone and fax number. It immediately had caught my eye (the
money) and then I saw Dr. Purrizzo's [i.e. Joseph P. Pizzurro's?] name
and I thought that I could get the job. I NEVER ONCE thought about the
steroid trial. It never even entered my mind.
I fax over my resume and a cover letter to Dr. Purrizzo. And about a
day later he calls me. I ask him about the job and in the sweetest
voice he says to me "Sure the job is still open Andy, come on in
for an interview, how about tomorrow about 1:00. Do you know where my
office NOW is?" I said that I did not, so he gave me directions.
The next day at 1:00 I am in his office, his secretary calls to tell
him that I am here, and I go in to see him. I sit in the high back
leather chair and all of a sodden he explodes with anger.
"EITHER YOU ARE THE DUMBEST MOTHERF*CKER ON THE PLANET, OR YOU
HAVE GOT THE BIGGEST SET OF BALLS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!"
"What the hell are you talking about?" I answer. He says
"DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT I WANT TO DO TO YOU? YOU STROLL IN
HERE LIKE YOU HAVE NO FEAR OF ME AT ALL WHEN YO ARE F*CKING MY WIFE UP
AT THAT SCHOOL OF YOURS, AND THEN BECAUSE YOU HAVE RUINED MY
CAREER", and he lifts his hand from behind his desk and he has a
gun in it. "Do to me?" I say, "For what? What did I
do?" "Don't even try and play dumb with me, I've been kicked
off the board and I'm out of the hospital because of you!" he
says. And then I remembered everything, I said "how do you blame
me for what you did, don't you EVER forget that you came after me, I
was just a kid minding my own business, and YOU wanted to lock me up
and cut out my brain just because I wouldn't admit to doing something
that I didn't do. THEN you kidnap me and almost kill me with your
drugs! As for f*cking your wife, yes Mrs. Purrizzo showed up a few
times, but I NEVER did anything with her, I turned her down every
time. BESIDES that happened a long time ago, and if anyone owes
anything it's YOU owing me an apology and you can start by giving me a
job." He drops the gun and puts his hands on his head and shouts
out "This is f*cking unbelievable!.. YOUR LYING! YOUR TELLING ME
THAT SHE SHOWED UP BEGGING YOU TO F*CK HER AND YOU TURNED HER DOWN!
SEVERAL TIMES! AND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN A LONG TIME AGO.. IT'S BEEN 18
MONTHS.. ANDY!" I said "That's correct, I never touched Mrs.
Purrizzo at Rochester". Then he said "We'll find out what
happened" and he pulls out a little shiny ball on a string and
starts to waive it in front of me from behind his desk I get up and
say "are you kidding me with this". He pecks up the gun and
tells me to sit back down in the chair and to look at the ball. I am
out within seconds. I hear him yelling "I GOT HIM" "I
GOT HIM".
From what I can remember he then has me go over to his examining
table, and he starts to question me. I tell him that I really didn't
sleep with his wife in college, and that I know who did. Then all of a
sodden I remember freaking out and yelling "U.S. GOVERNMENT
SECRET PROJECT 35765XXXX VIOLATION OF THIS MIND CAP IS PUNISHABLE BY
DEATH etc..etc!" When I leave his office I am sweating and the
nurse is looking at me like I have two heads on my shoulders. He calls
me two days later and tells me that I got the job. So for the rest of
that break I parked cars for Dr. Purrizzo at the HO-HO-Kus Inn.
After the break the two guys who had slept with Dr. Purrizzo's wife
and her friend, the woman with the black hair, show up for lifting one
day and they have had the living shit beaten out of them by the Mafia
April 1990- As the spring comes, Adolph brings me into a room. Mr.
Green is there. He tells me that the "rules have changed and that
now the rule's for retirement have changed. I must now do 25 missions
in order to retire not the 10 I was promised. I tell him that
"that's utter bullshit and we both know it." It was an
obvious attempt to get me to do more assassinations, but I was
fighting the programming. I tell him that I have run my 10 missions
and even if the rules have changed I still get the old law because the
offer was made at the time it applied to me so I get "Grand
fathered" in, and if he doesn't like it he can speak to my
lawyer. Then he asked me if I had a lawyer and I said "NO"
but I would get one for this. And that there was no way that I was
going to do any more because I was retired. Mr. Green starts to freak
out and he tells me that if I don't do it he will kill me right here
and he puts a gun to my head. All I said was speak to my lawyer. Which
pissed him off even more. They tried every means of persuasion to get
me to go another 15 missions. Every thing from a gun to my head to
beatings, to threatening to kill my family. But I would not budge.
Next came the character test. They had been watching me every day of
my life from almost the day that I had arrived at the University of
Rochester (actually it was since I was age 2), but anyway they were
testing me weather I knew it or not. From the close quarters with Gwen
to Gwen wanting to have sex with me. To me turning her down. To how I
reacted to this situation to how I reacted to that situation. They
bring me into a dark room, there are people all around me, but I
cannot see them. All I can see is a small desk light on the table and
a figure behind it. He starts to ask me questions about why I stole
Brian's steroids. I knew that I was screwed if I answered either way.
If I answered "Yes" I stole them and admitted to the wrong
doing would they see it as being honest or would they see it as being
a tattle tale, or if I said "NO" and lied about it even
though I knew they had video tape of me doing it would they see me as
someone who could keep their mouth shut under the pressure or would
they see me as being a lier.
So I did the only thing I could in an attempt to escape, my only way
out. I answered BOTH WAYS. At first I said "NO", then I
changed my answer to "YES" then back to "NO"
again, and I waffled back and forth several times until they told me
to leave. The man with the white hair then takes me back to my room.
He has a smirk on his face as I believe he knows what I have tried to
do.
I thought I was out, they couldn't trust me and they didn't know what
to think of me, maybe, just maybe they would just leave me alone. As
it turns out, they take me into the woods by car ride. We get out of
the car and the two men tell me to go over and look over the edge of
this huge hole they had dug in the ground. I hear the one man
"cock" his pistol. Without thinking or without any thought I
leaped back at him like I was a cheetah, grabbed the gun and broke his
neck with my hand by crushing his throat and windpipe like it was an
empty beer can. The other man starts to run away and I ran him down
within a few feet and broke his neck too. I sat down right there next
to the bodies and began to cry.
"Why does everyone want to kill me" I kept saying to my self
"I just want to be left alone, I just want to be a kid going to
college". I heard the portable phone ring a few times but I
didn't answer it. After a while another car showed up, it's the man
with the white hair and he tells me to get in the car and we drive
off. I'm sitting in the back seat and I look out the back window I see
them examining the bodies as we drive off. My realities were starting
to blur as my programming began to come undone.
No paper work- A day or so later I am back in the dark room with the
small lamp, this time they sit me down and discuss with me my options.
This time it's a different Mr. Green. A man that I don't ever remember
seeing. He told me that I can either corporate and continue as an
agent or they will be forced to kill me as they can never just let me
go. I remember making a joke "I don't suppose you will let me go
and we will forget the whole thing ever happened" I said. The man
did not laugh at all. I knew they were serious. So I let him have it.
"Agent! agent1 I'm not an agent, and I'm not in the f*cking army,
I'm a f*cking college kid, who you have taken against my will and done
something, so you can go fu*ck your self as far as Iím
concerned."
By the look on his face I could tell that this was news to him. He
makes me leave and go into the hall. I can hear intense arguing now
going on inside. "WHAT THE F*CK DO YOU MEAN HE NEVER SIGNED THE
PAPER WORK! YOUR TELLING ME THAT THIS KID HAS BEEN AN INVOLUNTARY
SUBJECT ALL ALONG!. YOU F*CKING IDIOTS, IF THIS EVER GETS OUT"
and he goes on and on. I actually thought I had a chance now. They
call me back in. The new Mr. Green puts a piece of paper in front of
me and tells me to sign it. I start to read it and he bursts in and
yells "JUST SIGN IT GOD D*MN IT". I was always told to read
everything before you sign anything.
