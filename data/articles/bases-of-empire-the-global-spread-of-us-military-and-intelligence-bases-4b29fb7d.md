Introduction
The United States is the world's only remaining
superpower.
By the end of the 20th Century, it had been
struck hard by the global crisis of overproduction and by financial crisis
of unprecedented proportions. The US launched its wars of aggression, in
Afghanistan and Iraq, to acquire sources and supply routes of oil and other
raw materials, markets, fields of investment and spheres of influence.
History will tell us how the United States
committed far worse acts of terrorism than those of September 11, 2001 in
carrying out their continuing global War on Terror against the people of the
world. The US does everything to maintain its superpower status through its
high technology and high tech weaponry.
Its history will indicate how it acquired its
military bases as spoils of wars throughout the world to protect its own
economic and political interests.
US
Military Overseas Deployment, Bases And Access
The US has the highest military expenditures in
the world. It spent over 3.7% of its gross domestic production on its
military ($US478.2 billion) in 2000.
This is half of the $US1 trillion of military
expenditures worldwide, more than double the budget of the European Union
combined ($US217 billion) and nearly five times larger than the budget of
China $US80 billion (2005 estimate).
The estimates provided in
this graph differ slightly
from the ones offered by
Fabros in that these estimates
are 2008 estimates while
those used by Fabros are 2005 estimates.
There are 386,000 troops or 27% of all US
military personnel deployed outside US territory. The US maintains a
military presence in more than 155 countries and territories (30 of which
have 100 or more US servicemen and 14 with more than 1,000).
Under the new Unified Command Plan instituted in
2002, the US has five geographical commands to cover and direct the US
military forces overseas:
-
EUCOM
for Europe,
-
CENTCOM
for the Middle East,
-
PACOM
for Asia-Pacific,
-
SOUTHCOM
for Latin America,
-
NORTHCOM for North America.
The STRATCOM or the US Strategic Command
covers space and missile early warning systems.
The various commands supervise and are
responsible for military relationships with countries in their respective
regions in areas of security cooperation and military coordination. The
commands also ensure interoperability of existing military and defense
alliances with allies overseas.
Recently, the African Command (AFRICOM)
for Africa has been established, further strengthening the US influence in
that part of the world.
The US maintains the most extensive foreign
basing structure in the world. The US Department of Defense itself
acknowledged the extent of their domestic bases assets in 2005 (buildings,
structures and utilities): more than half a million facilities (571,900) on
more than 3,740 sites occupying nearly 30 million acres (over 12 million
hectares).
Overseas (in territories and foreign soil),
there are 117,951 facilities occupying 318,819 hectares. These are in 769
sites in 39 foreign locations and seven US territories not including those
in Iraq and Afghanistan.
For the period covering 2003-2005, an average of
around 390,000 overseas US troops were deployed around the world.
This number was double that of 1993-2002, when
overseas troops were lowest, and were at levels similar to those of
1970-1992.
...are examples of bases that were closed during
the early 1990s together with the reduction of around 300,000 military
personnel.
For 2003-2005, the US negotiated 20 treaties
and/or agreements covering military deployment and personnel through Status
of Forces agreements (SOFA), Access and Cross-Servicing agreements (ACSA)
and/or Mutual Logistics Support agreements (MLSA), collectively known as
S/A/M agreements.
We note that in 1993-2002 when US troop
deployments were reduced, there were 62 such treaties/agreements that were
newly signed between the US and other countries, either by adding on access
and cross-servicing and status of forces to existing agreements or by
signing new pacts. In all, the US has military, logistics and status
agreements with at least 129 countries as of 2005.
More and more of the S/A/M agreements are being
signed or negotiated by the US.
Table I.
Access And Status Of Forces Treaties By
The US And Historical Deployment Of The US Military
Two things are noteworthy from Table 1:
More of these access and status of forces
agreements or treaties are being negotiated by the US with other host or
potential host countries.
The number of troops stationed overseas has been
reduced by more frequent but shorter deployments of troops. Furthermore,
advances in transportation, communications and military technology have
maintained the productivity and effectiveness of overseas bases despite the
relative reduction in numbers.
The relative increase in troop deployments in
2003-2005 is due to the nearly 150,000 US troops in the Middle East that are
currently engaged in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and
Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq.
The massive introduction of US troops into the
Middle East that started during the 1991 Gulf War and the continuing
deployment of US troops for the Iraq and Afghanistan occupation spawned new
bases in these countries as well as those nearby.
This is in line with the
Project for the New American Century in
which the personnel strength was to be restored to levels anticipated in the
"Base Force" outlined by the Bush Administration.
Repositioning To Meet "21st Century"
Realities
In the same document, the need to reposition US
forces to respond to "21st Century" strategic realities was enunciated by
shifting permanently-based forces to Southeast Europe and Southeast Asia
reflecting strategic concerns of the US in these areas.
Geographically, Europe remains the largest
concentration of main operating bases outside the United States mainland. In
2004, European bases hosted over 116,000 troops, their 125,000 dependents,
and 45,000 support personnel, plus their dependents.
The key countries are Germany with air and
ground troops, the UK with air and naval personnel, Italy with air and naval
bases and Turkey with air bases. US documents indicate a planned force
reduction to 60,000 and a shift to lighter ground forces and adding Romanian
and Bulgarian bases to US force posture (in 2005, US troops in the European
Command numbered around 98,000).
NEW US
BASES IN BULGARIA IN TERRITORY ONCE
CONTROLLED BY THE OLD SOVIET UNION
In Asia, there are over 67,000 overseas troops
in around 225 bases in Japan, South Korea and Indonesia.
There are forces in Thailand, access agreements
with Singapore and military exercises in actual combat zones in the southern
Philippines. Guam remains the most important place outside the US mainland
where new air, naval and ground facilities are being slated to be added.
Guam is also set to receive redeployments of
7,000 Marines from Japan (Okinawa) while South Korea also faces significant
redeployments and consolidations.
Using China as a pretext, US, as well as
Taiwanese, military officials are pushing for a theatre missile defense (TMD)
system installation in Taiwan as part of the US dual encirclement and
engagement policy towards China. The absence of a US military base or
deployment in Taiwan does not deter large arms sales to Taiwan.
US arms sales to Taiwan have been significant at
$US71 billion for 1999-2005 alone, third after Japan and South Korea. In his
confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates
said:
"We should maintain our capabilities to
resist China's use of force or coercion against Taiwan and assist Taipei
in maintaining its self-defense".
Regular defense dialogues between defense
officials of Taiwan and the US are also held regularly.
In the Middle East, bases in Bahrain, Kuwait,
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and Oman in the south; in Lebanon,
and Turkey in the north; and Pakistan and Afghanistan in the east form a
partial ring around oil rich countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq and the
critical sea lanes in the Persian Gulf.
The Middle East has the largest number of US
troop deployments with approximately 218,000 (but frequently changing).
There are a number of bases in Iraq in the
ongoing effort to conduct "stability operations" that serve as bases of
power projection against Iran and Syria. There are also new bases in
Afghanistan, which flank western China and provide control and protection of
pipelines from the Caspian Sea basin through Central Asia.
This economic aspect underlies the increasing
importance of the bases in Central Asia in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan and Pakistan where around 70% of the world's oil reserves and
natural gas lie.
In Iraq in 2005, the US military maintained 106
forward operating bases with 14 "enduring" bases. There were around 40 large
bases (2005) and 110 small to medium bases in Iraq.
The reduction of base infrastructure brought the
total number of bases down to around 75 in 2006.
Map of the
14 "ENDURING BASES" (i.e., permanent
bases) US military bases in Iraq:
These bases will remain
after the US supposedly pulls out what is described
as its "combat forces." The forces that will remain
on these bases will be re-designated as "military
assistance" forces and / or "logistics personnel."
And this doesn't count the thousands of other
"mercenary forces." Indeed, the US is slated to
double its mercenary forces in Iraq after the
so-called 2011 Military Pullout date.
In 2006, US troop deployment at sea was about
127,000. Sea-based forces include those aboard ships such as aircraft
carriers, destroyers and submarines.
These carriers serve as moving centers of
projected strength through their strike capabilities.
USS GEORGE
WASHINGTON
There are ships
the USA has in their military arsenal and then
THERE ARE SHIPS THE
USA HAS IN THEIR MILITARY FLEET, the kind
that no other nation on earth possesses. [The
carriers in the French, British, Italian, Russian,
etc. fleets are app. 35,000 tons apiece. The
carriers the US possesses approach 100,000 tons -
this is why they are referred as
SUPER-CARRIERS;
the US has 12 of these on active duty, and many
others in "reserve."]
You don't have
to look no further than the
USS George
Washington; which is in a class of its own.
Able to carry more than 6,000 sailors, crewmen,
pilots, and other military personnel is just the
starting point. This super-carrier can also hold up
to 70 airplanes and is routinely carrying about 4
million pounds of bombs and other explosives on
board; which can be delivered in a variety of ways.
Not to mention all of the other military ships and
under water submarines, that would be traveling
along the side the
USS George Washington. This super-carrier
is a permanent fixture in the Asian-Pacific Ocean
and is normally docked on the shores of Japan.
These ships can also contain sea-launched cruise
missiles such as the Tomahawk which are part of the existing triad of
strategic nuclear force projection.
In Asia, the US Third Fleet covers the Eastern
and Central Pacific while the Seventh Fleet based at Yokosuka covers the
length of the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean.
There are around 35 submarines (nine SSBN, two
SSGN, 24 SSN) deployed in the region, some of which are capable of launching
submarine-launched Trident and Poseidon ballistic missiles. SSBN - Ship
Submersible Ballistic missile Nuclear powered. SSGN - Ship Submersible
Guided missile Nuclear powered. SSN - Ship Submersible Nuclear powered.
Through the US Navy Sea Power 21 and Marine
Corps Strategy 21, the US Navy introduces new concepts of maritime
pre-positioning: high speed sea lift, new amphibious capabilities of Marine
Corps and training for littoral warfare in Western Pacific.
It has three prongs according to Sea Power 21:
-
Sea Strike - Projecting Precise and
Persistent Offensive Power. Expanded power projection that employs
networked sensors, combat systems, and warriors to amplify the
offensive impact of sea based forces;
-
Sea Shield - Projecting Global Defensive
Assurance. Provided by extended homeland defense, sustained access
to littoral [coastal] zones and the projection of defensive power
deep over land;
-
Sea Basing - Projecting Joint
Operational Independence and support for joint forces provided by
networked mobile, and secure sovereign platforms operating in
maritime domain.
The US Quadrennial Defense Review Report in 2001
called for an increased naval presence in the Pacific as well as
pre-positioned equipment and contingency basing assets in the Persian Gulf
and Indian Ocean.
These are in four forward regions:
-
Europe
-
Northeast Asia
-
East Asian Littoral regions
-
Middle East-Southwest Asia
Overseas base structures and facilities are now
classified into three types: Main Operating Bases (MOB), Forward Operating
Locations (FOL), and Cooperative Security Locations (CSL).
Main operating bases (MOB) are US bases with
permanently stationed forces with their families. Rearrangement of forces in
European and Asian MOBs such as Ramstein (Germany) will result in relative
force reductions: 65,000 troops are planned to be removed from Europe and
one brigade from South Korea.
These forces are to be deployed to other
locations where they are needed. Forward operating bases or locations
(FOB/FOL) include the sprawling Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo and Manas in
Kyrgyzstan as well as the vast Grafenwoehr/Vilseck/Hohenfels complex in
Germany.
These FOL are bases with pre-positioned
equipment and small military support groups.
Camp BONDSTEEL
from where the
US controls ALL of the Balkans.
Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan
from where the US controls the airspace
over Central Asia
and most of the nations south
of present-day Russia
who were member-states of the
old Soviet Union.
Cooperative security locations or CSLs are
facilities occupied only for training, exercises and other military
interactions (e.g., rest and recreation activities) with regional partner
countries.
Examples of these locations are those where
joint Balikatan (Shoulder to Shoulder) exercises in the Philippines and
Cobra Gold in Thailand are usually held. New CSLs are being developed in
Africa, South Central Asia and East Asia that do not require permanent
basing structures such as the carrier pier in Singapore.
Recent US military aggression in Iraq,
Afghanistan and in the Balkans has brought about new military bases and
control over oil resources. But over the long term the US aims to increase
its reach while keeping the profile of its intervention small.
This is evident in the problems highlighted by
the report of the 2006 Iraq Study Group.
This is but a recipe for neo-colonialism:
-
intervention or direct aggression in a
country, rapid stabilization of the state or area using the force
required
-
a shift to a minimum US military
presence as rapidly as possible
-
rapid creation and training of effective
local security and intelligence forces
-
reduction of forces to a required
minimum to encourage "sustained reform".
However,
"...the more that local government and
security forces are seen as proxies or subordinates of the US, the more
difficult it will be for them to establish legitimacy".
The Role of US Bases and Their Impact
on People's Lives and Environment
"The presence
of American forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the
US commitments to allies and friends.
Through our
willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others,
the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of
power that favors freedom.
To contend
with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face, the
United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western
Europe and Northeast Asia, as well as temporary access arrangements for
the long-distance deployment of US forces".
George Bush, National Security Strategy,
2002
US overseas military bases reflect the need for
the United States to project a visible and psychological presence and
commitment to a country or region.
US bases are stark reminders and real sources of
control over a nation without necessitating formal political control over
its territorial sovereignty. It can be likened to a loaded gun pointed at
the government and peoples of its host country.
Its mere presence intimidates and gives coercive
power for the US to gain concessions from the host and allows it to
interfere, in most cases with impunity, in internal affairs, commit crimes
and violence on local people, and wreak grave social costs and environmental
destruction.
US military bases serve as surveillance and data
centers.
These bases, such as those within the NSA
ECHELON
network, provide intelligence gathering functions for the US. The
data collected from these activities are not necessarily limited to those
with military use but also extends to economic surveillance as well. In
terms of surveillance and data centers - we see this as a vital function
taken on by host countries like the Philippines (until the US bases were
booted out in 1992 after almost a century of military occupation).
Currently, major US military facilities in Japan
and Okinawa, in Guam and in Australia take on this function of surveillance
and data gathering.
Which makes me ask the question - how much of
the surveillance and data gathering work done at Waihopai as well as at
Tangimoana contribute to this global surveillance and data gathering work
for the United States?
While they are technically New Zealand
facilities, as the New Zealand and the United States governments have
consistently claimed, one can't help but ask the question how much of their
work contributes to US capability and military strength in its global
posturing.
These are new issues I have encountered on my
speaking tour of New Zealand with the Anti-Bases Campaign.
It would be very interesting and useful to know
the truth behind these facilities in New Zealand and how they contribute to
the United States' wars of aggression in the Middle East and its expanding
military presence in Asia and the Pacific.

Echelon base in Waihopai, New Zealand;
US Echelon base in Geraldton,
Western Australia.
US bases also serve as locations for
pre-positioning supplies.
Even before September 11, 2001, in the "Project
for a New American Century" and in the 2001 Quadrennial Defense
Review (QDR2001), the Pentagon was reconfiguring its forces to become
smaller, more flexible, and better able to respond to sudden events, thus
necessitating pre-positioned supplies and war materiel.
In situations lacking established bases, the US
has entered into more than 80 bilateral agreements since 1992 to provide it
with a range of access and status of forces agreements that it can call on
depending on the need of the situation.
In addition, through its use of advanced
military technology, these agreements allow the US to apply greater amounts
of military force over greater distances in shorter periods of time.
The 2004 National Military Strategy outlines how
expanded bases can increase the ability of the US military to rapidly
deploy, employ, sustain and redeploy capabilities in geographically
separated and environmentally diverse regions.
These bases serve as launch pads for the
pre-emptive strikes including nuclear attack, "peace-enforcement" and
"constabulary" functions that the QDR 2001 has called for.
US bases also serve as sites for training &
munitions testing. US Navy weapons testing was carried out in Vieques,
Puerto Rico, for over 60 years (ended in 2003) and included testing for
operations in the Persian Gulf region. Vieques also hosted a US Navy
listening post for underwater tracking of submarines and an electronic
warfare range for testing new weapons systems.
Crow Valley in Clark Air Base in the Philippines
was used as a practice bombing site before the removal of the bases in 1992.
US military presence in bases or in exercises
and training is usually seen as a precursor to intervention and war. In East
Africa, where around 30 US National Guard soldiers from Guam have been
training Ethiopian commandos in supposed "anti-terrorism" exercises,
tensions flared up over a long standing border dispute with Somalia. It is
not an accident that the US has been conducting this training near the
border and that the Islamic Somali leadership has resisted this presence.
US bases are bases for counter-insurgency in the
host country and surrounding regions.
So-called "stability operations" are venues for
political and military intervention in domestic affairs and excuses for US
military presence. In performing "peace-enforcement" and "constabulary"
functions, such as that in Iraq, the US has shown its willingness to
directly intervene to allow US companies and firms free rein in the plunder
of Iraq's resources.
In Mindanao, southern Philippines, the US
military has provided training, war materiel, logistic support and "advice"
to Special Forces of the Armed Forces of the Philippines as part of its War
on Terror.
The forward positioning of US bases serves as
forward tripwires, guaranteeing timely and rapid US intervention in a crisis
situation as in the case of the function of US bases in the Korean
peninsula.
That the US calls the Philippines its "second
front in the War on Terror" is not an accident.
The US, through its periodic and overlapping
joint exercises with the Philippine military, is able to strengthen its
position in the Philippines for the purpose of ensuring its control over oil
resources in Southeast Asia.
US bases serve as launching pads for US
aggression.
Clark Air Force Base, Subic Naval Base and
other military installations in the Philippines were used for launching wars
of intervention from the 1950s until 1991. Clark was used to send bombing
missions during the Korean War of 1950-1953 and in the bombing of Sumatra
during a rebellion by the Indonesian army in 1958.
Clark also figured in the deployment of US
forces in the area of the Taiwan Strait islands of Quemoy and Matsu, which
were militarily disputed by Taiwan and China.
From 1955-1986, US military bases in the
Philippines were used frequently for bombing missions in the wars, the
training and deployment of US troops, and as communication links as well as
for rest and recreation of tired US servicemen.
Map showing US bases in Latin
America,
or bases that it can access.
US bases serve to secure sea-lanes, oil
pipelines and other economic interests of the US.
To provide energy security, the US surrounds oil
rich countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait with a US military
presence through direct basing or access agreements in neighboring
countries. In the guise of counter-narcotics to straddle Venezuela, Bolivia
and other Latin American oil rich countries, the US launched Plan Colombia
and other exercises. It has occupied Afghanistan to secure pipelines from
Central Asia.
It has positioned itself in Singapore and has
established a US base within a Philippine military base (Zamboanga), and
consistently maintained US troops in the Philippines through military
exercises to protect the sea lanes through which nearly 50% of world trade
passes.
Military deployment under the US war on
terrorism through direct basing and/or access agreements ensures continuing
expansion of the US Empire and protection of its political and economic
interests.
In terms of social cost of US
military bases and presence, violation of national sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the host country has the greatest
impact. The arrival of US forces invariably involves some form
of military intervention including outright aggression,
occupation and colonization.
This is aggravated by the US policy and practice
of shielding its troops from criminal prosecution under the host's judicial
processes and system, oftentimes under the legal cover contained in access
and status of forces agreements.
US Bases In The Asia Pacific Region
"The presence
of 100,000 US military personnel is not arbitrary - it represents the
formidable capabilities of the US Eighth Army and Seventh Air Force in
Korea, III Marine Expeditionary Force and Fifth Air Force in Japan, and
the US Seventh Fleet, all focused on shaping, responding and preparing
as necessary to achieve security and stability in the region."
These forces in the Asia Pacific region are
mainly in these positions:
-
Japanese bases which maintain, the US
Fifth Air Force, including 18th Wing, 35th
Fighter Wing and 374th Airlift Wing
-
the Navy Seventh Fleet, including USS
Kitty Hawk Carrier Battle Group (which was replaced by the US
nuclear aircraft carrier USS George Washington on September 25,
2008)
-
USS Belleau Wood Amphibious Ready Group
-
III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF)
-
Ninth Theater Area Army Command (TAACOM)
-
First USA Special Forces Battalion
South Korea hosts the US Seventh Air Force,
including the Eighth and the 51st Fighter Wings, and the Eighth
Army, including the Second Infantry Division.
In addition to the forces above, visiting forces
allow additional routine combined exercises and training, and ship visits.
Changi Naval Station in Singapore accommodates US naval combatants and
includes a pier which can accommodate US aircraft carriers.
Thailand is an important refueling and transit
point for operations in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. Australia has
long provided key access to facilities for US unilateral and combined
exercises. The US makes 60-80 port calls per year to Hong Kong for minor
maintenance and repair of transiting ships.
Access agreements have become increasingly
important as US forces and bases have been reconfigured and plans to
downsize its forces in the region are underway.
USS Ronald Reagan and other
US warships
at Changi Naval Station in Singapore
In South Korea, Japan, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Australia, access to key host
nation facilities, ports and airfields are critical to the US security
objectives in the Asia-Pacific.
Access agreements such as Mutual Logistics
Support Agreements and Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreements make available
the use of host nation resources to support day-to-day and future
operational requirements. They also enable joint training and exercises,
"constabulary" operations, humanitarian and disaster relief operations.
These provide the US access to basing and
infrastructure necessary for its force projection without the need for a
permanent presence.
The US offers these countries money to upgrade
and maintain infrastructure, bases and airfields. In addition, the US spent
$US265.7 million for 2001-2004 in training 4,000 Indonesian, 1,200 Filipino,
and 700 Thai police.
Taiwan is also one of the region's largest
weapons buyers from the US while the Philippines has been its largest
recipient of military aid.
Under its global War on Terror, the Bush
Administration deployed over 1,200 troops, including 150 US Special Forces,
to the southern Philippines to advise the Philippine military in their
pursuit of the Abu Sayyaf Group.
It also increased intelligence sharing
operations, restarted military to military relations with Indonesia and
provided or requested from the US Congress over $US1 billion in aid to
Indonesia and the Philippines.
Guam - The New Key Hub for Pacific Power
Projection
There are important developments in the region
that we need to keep a close watch on.
The Pacific island of Guam is being transformed
into a key hub for American maritime power in the western Pacific. The
strategic importance of Guam to Washington's long-term presence in East Asia
was a point hammered home by US Defense Secretary Robert Gates in
Singapore recently.
Gates' speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue,
an annual gathering of Asian defense ministers and military chiefs, was his
most complete exposition of future US defense strategy in the region since
he took over from Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon in early 2007.
HEADQUARTERS FOR SUPER-BASE
IN GUAM
ANDERSON AFB ON GUAM
USS NIMITZ OFF GUAM
US building a super-base on Pacific island of Guam
The US is building a super military base on the Pacific
island of Guam
to contain China's military
build-up.
The expansion will include a
dock for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, a missile
defense system, live-fire training sites and the
expansion
of the island's airbase.
It will be the largest
investment in a military base in the western Pacific
since the Second World War, and the biggest spend on
naval infrastructure in decades.
Estimates suggest that the
island's population will rise by almost 50 per cent from
its current 173,000 at the peak of construction.
It will eventually house
19,000 Marines who will be relocated from the Japanese
island of Okinawa, where the US force has become
unpopular.
The US was not about to begin a long, slow,
historic withdrawal from the region.
Instead the US Defense Secretary outlined the
concept of the US as a 'resident power' in addition to its longstanding
roles as an ally, partner, friend and routine offshore presence.
Critical to its long term focus as a resident
power will be Guam, the site of the largest US military build-up in the
Mariana Islands since World War II. As the Pentagon chief pointed out,
sovereign US territory in the western Pacific stretches all the way from the
Aleutian Islands to Guam.
For US defense planners aiming for a mobile,
more flexible US global military posture across the globe, Guam is an ideal
staging post. And for close allies of the US in the western Pacific, led by
Japan and Australia, Guam promises to become a vital facility as it hosts
exercises and trains with allied air and naval forces.
Secretary Gates also made a flying visit to
Guam, 6, 000km west of Hawaii and 2, 000km southeast of Japan, to look at
planned defense infrastructure. Acquired from Spain in 1898 following the
Spanish-American War, Guam became a refueling station for the US Navy.
Guam has long been an important logistics base.
Over the next six years the Pentagon will spend billions on a new port
capable of berthing a nuclear powered aircraft carrier, and will build air
bases, schools, hospitals and housing for US military personnel and their
families.
Guam's Andersen Air Base will soon be home to a
detachment of unmanned, long-range Global Hawk surveillance aircraft able to
track Chinese warships and submarines emerging from their home ports into
the Pacific Ocean or the South China Sea.
F-22 Raptor
The US Air Force's newest fighter, the F-22
Raptor, will also be periodically flying on exercises from the island.
By 2014 Guam will receive about 8, 000 US
Marines who will transfer from their present base in Okinawa, the Japanese
Government helping pay the $US10 billion-plus relocation costs. With a
population of about 170,000 Guam is already home to 12,000 US military
personnel and the heavy build-up promises to put further strain on local
communities.
Its naval base hosts three attack submarines and
the Air Force rotates its strategic bombers through Guam.
As the island's new facilities take
shape in coming years, they will be increasingly multilateral in
orientation, with training opportunities and possible
pre-positioning of assets. Clearly, a message designed to convey
a reassurance to the US's close allies in East Asia that talk of
the gradual diminution of the US's military posture in the face
of a renascent China was misplaced.
The Defense Secretary argues forcefully
Washington's presence has been an essential element in assisting Asia's
economic revival,
"opening doors, protecting and preserving
common spaces on the high seas, in space and more and more in the cyber
world".
"This presence has offered other nations the
crucial element of choice and enabled their entry into a globalized
international society," he said.
"As someone who has served seven US
Presidents, I want to convey to you with confidence that any future US
Administration's Asia security policy is going to be grounded in the
fact that the United States remains a nation with strong and enduring
interests in the region, interests that will endure no matter which
political party occupies the White House next year".
Gates went on to say that any speculation in the
region about the US losing interest in Asia struck him as,
"preposterous or disingenuous, or both".
He stressed US military ties with East Asia,
even with its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, were more constructive
than at any time in US history.
New Spybase In Australia
In Australasia a very significant new initiative
is the construction of a new top secret US military communications base in
Western Australia.
Australian Defense Minister Joel Fitzgibbon
revealed recently that work would begin in July or August of 2008 on a
satellite ground station for the US Mobile Users Objective System, a new
satellite communications system being deployed by the US Navy.
The new US defense facility will be located
adjacent to the existing Australian satellite signals intelligence facility
at Geraldton, Western Australia (the existing spy base is functionally
equivalent to New Zealand's Waihopai station and both are key facilities in
the US Echelon global intelligence system).
The base will be linked to a network of
communications satellites that will provide frontline US military units with
instant access to high grade intelligence and tactical information. Once
operational, the new facility will automatically provide communications
support for US military operations in Iraq and the Persian Gulf.
Indeed, it will also automatically provide
communications support for US military operations in much of the
Asia-Pacific region.
The
Age has learned that the
US is to build the base,
which follows
three years of secret negotiations with Canberra.
The base will
provide a crucial link for a new network of military
satellites that will help America's ability to fight
wars in the Middle East and Asia.
It is the first
big US military installation to be built in
Australia since the controversy surrounding the
joint
spy base at Pine Gap
more than two decades ago.
It will provide
a key link in the system that will carry orders and
intelligence information to US and allied troops on
operations in the world's hotspots.
Details of the
deal emerged on the same day as the US finally told
Australia it would not allow even its key allies,
including Australia,
to buy
its best fighter aircraft, the F-22 Raptor.
The base, about
370 kilometers north of Perth, will control two of
five geostationary satellites - those with the
highest priority parked over the Indian Ocean
to monitor the
unstable Middle East.
Building may
start within months.
Australian defense officials announced late in
2007 that they had finalized an agreement with the US Navy for the new
satellite communications centre.
Mr Fitzgibbon's confirmation that construction
would proceed came shortly after newly elected Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's
withdrawal of the bulk of Australian combat troops from Iraq.
The new Geraldton facility will be the first
major US defense base to be established in Australia since the construction
in the 1960s of the
Joint Defense Facility at Pine Gap in the
Northern Territory and the now closed early warning satellite ground station
at Nurrungar in South Australia.
It was also revealed that the US Navy had
contracted with Boeing Australia to provide construction services for the
new Geraldton base. Boeing Australia already provides operational support
for the existing facility at Geraldton, another Australian signals
intelligence facility at Shoal Bay near Darwin, the Australian Navy's
communication station at North West Cape near Exmouth, and the Defense
Communications Network facility at Deakin.
About 70 Australian contractors are working on
the design of the new Geraldton building
and up to 20 United States staff and 100 Australian contractors will be
involved in the construction phase.
The ground station will comprise three buildings
housing sophisticated electronic infrastructure, three 18m satellite dishes
and two smaller antennas.
Once complete, the base will be fully automated
and will require only call-out maintenance support. All costs will be
carried by the US. Informal discussions on the possible location of the
facility in Australia began in 2003. Australian Defense and the US Navy
signed a classified memorandum of understanding setting out the governing
arrangements for the station in November 2007.
The conclusion of a secret memorandum of
understanding rather than a formal treaty means the agreement has not been
reviewed by Federal Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.
Mr Fitzgibbon has said the ground station will
be operational by 2011.
There is also the new Hawaii Regional Security
Operations Center complex at the US Naval Computer and Telecommunications
Area Master Station Pacific. The $US318 Million, 250,000 square foot complex
is the largest construction in Naval Engineering Facility Command and is
scheduled for completion in late 2010.
The new facility will be used to gather and
analyze intelligence from US interest areas, such as the Middle East and
South East Asia, allowing high ranking officials to make better tactical
decisions.
Because of the tremendous changes in
communications technology over the past two decades, coupled with the
disturbing social and political dynamics, newer and better ways to process
intelligence are needed.
Through its military bases and access
agreements, the US makes its presence felt in an ever-widening circle driven
by its greed for resources and markets.
However, as attempts are made to expand this
circle, the US faces the resistance and condemnation of oppressed people of
the world who continue to develop solidarity to strengthen their continued
call for peace and justice.
Nations have also stood firm in their assertion
of sovereignty and independence against the US Empire's never ending greed
for power and dominance.
