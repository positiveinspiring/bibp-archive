Part II
Syria, Libya, and beyond, Globalists
prepare for second phase.
May 18, 2011
Bangkok, Thailand May 18, 2011
While the "easier"
nations of Tunisia and Egypt were picked apart by
foreign-funded color revolutions, the global
corporate-financier oligarchs knew well in advance
nations like Libya, Syria, and Iran would be
fundamentally different.
For all intents and purposes this is the final battle
between nation-states and this abhorrent, illegitimate
"international community."
The battle is building up to
what many geopolitical analysts call
World War III, but with an insidious twist. It is a
battle where festering imperial networks operating under
the guise of "civil society" and "NGOs" are turning
populations against their governments and serving as
impetus to usher in stooge replacements.
National
institutions will be supplanted by this global "civil
society" network, which in turn will interface with
contrived international institutions like the parasitic
IMF, the World Bank, and the increasingly farcical
United Nations.
The revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt were meant to serve
as the moral and rhetorical backdrop for successive and
increasingly more violent and costly campaigns against
Libya, Syria, and Iran.
In Libya's case,
nearly 30 years of on-and-off armed insurrection,
fully backed by the U.S., UK, and America's Arabic foreign
legion of Al Qaeda have defined the campaign against
Qaddafi. When the call was made on February 17, for a
"Day of Rage" by
Libyan leaders exiled in London, war was already a
foregone, fully provisioned conclusion.
So too are
operations
against Syria and Iran.
These are admitted facts
articulated clearly within the global elite's own
think-tanks and parroted verbatim by the feckless
puppets that constitute the governments of the West.
Laying to rest any doubt regarding the global elite's
designs toward the remaining sovereign nation-states of
the world, is the Brookings Institution's "Which Path to Persia?" report.
Previously covered (in Part I - above top page), the report has more meaning now
than ever, defining verbatim the approach, the tactics
and the outcomes expected in this next, decidedly more
violent phase of geopolitical reordering worldwide. We
can see the stratagems and methodology defined within
this report have played out not only in Iran, but in
Libya and Syria as well, with preparations and posturing
being made in regards to targets further along
China's "String of Pearls" and along Russia's vast
borders.
As we reexamine this treacherous plot, funded by some of
the
largest corporations and banking interests on earth,
we can see the playbook the global elite have been
clearly using, starting in Iran, and creeping its way
toward Moscow and Beijing.
Understanding this report,
disseminating it to both the people beneath the
governments criminally pursuing it and those desperately
defending against it, may balk what is perhaps the
greatest attempted geopolitical reordering in human
history.
Which
Path to Persia?
Virtually a handbook for overthrowing nations,
the 156 page report focuses on effecting regime
change within Iran.
However, it is quite clear it draws
on a body of knowledge derived from the Anglo-American
empire's long history of fomenting unrest, division,
insurgencies, coups, and regime change around the world.
It is irrefutable proof that the global elite, not our
legislators, are the arbiters of Western foreign policy.
It is also irrefutable proof that indeed the global
elite are capable and willing to foment popular street
protests, use murderous terrorism against sovereign
nation-states, buy off treasonous legions within a
foreign military to effect coups, and use violence of
their own creation as a pretext to intervene with full
military force.
Sanctions
Sanctions, page 39 (page 52 of PDF):
"For those who favor
regime change or a military attack on Iran (either by
the United States or Israel), there is a strong argument
to be made for trying this option first. inciting regime
change in Iran would be greatly assisted by convincing
the Iranian people that their government is so
ideologically blinkered that it refuses to do what is
best for the people and instead clings to a policy that
could only bring ruin on the country.
The ideal scenario
in this case would be that the United States and the
international community present a package of positive
inducements so enticing that the Iranian citizenry would
support the deal, only to have the regime reject it.
In a similar vein, any military operation against Iran
will likely be very unpopular around the world and
require the proper international context - both to ensure
the logistical support the operation would require and
to minimize the blowback from it.
The best way to
minimize international opprobrium and maximize support
(however, grudging or covert) is to strike only when
there is a widespread conviction that the Iranians were
given but then rejected a superb offer - one so good that
only a regime determined to acquire nuclear weapons and
acquire them for the wrong reasons would turn it down.
Under those circumstances, the United States (or Israel)
could portray its operations as taken in sorrow, not
anger, and at least some in the international community
would conclude that the Iranians brought it on
themselves by refusing a very good deal."
Regime change and perhaps even military operations
against Iran are talked about as a foregone conclusion,
with Brookings using the pretext of sanctions as merely
a means of incremental escalation to tip-toe the world
into backing regime change, including war with the
nation if need be.
This is exactly what has been done in
regards to Libya, with
disingenuous humanitarian concerns translated
into a no-fly zone, which incrementally transitioned
into
attacks on Qaddafi's ground forces,
targeted assassinations against Qaddafi himself, and
now talk of
destroying civilian infrastructure and
a full-out ground invasion.
A repeat scenario is playing out in Syria where
foreign-fueled violence is being used as a means to
engage in broader intervention.
While Western
governments feigns inaction and hesitation in the face
of a bloodbath they themselves instigated, in reality
they are creating the same sense of "bringing it upon
themselves" for Syria as Brookings talks about in
regards to Iran.
Invasion
Justifying Invasion, page 65 (page 78 of the PDF)
"If the United States
were to decide that to garner greater international
support, galvanize U.S. domestic support, and/or provide
a legal justification for an invasion, it would be best
to wait for an Iranian provocation, then the time frame
for an invasion might stretch out indefinitely.
With
only one real exception, since the 1978 revolution, the
Islamic Republic has never willingly provoked an
American military response, although it certainly has
taken actions that could have done so if Washington had
been looking for a fight.
Thus it is not impossible that Tehran might take some
action that would justify an American invasion and it is
certainly the case that if Washington sought such a
provocation, it could take actions that might make it
more likely that Tehran would do so (although being too
obvious about this could nullify the provocation).
However, since it would be up to Iran to make the
provocative move, which Iran has been wary of doing most
times in the past, the United States would never know
for sure when it would get the requisite Iranian
provocation. In fact, it might never come at all."
This is nothing less than
U.S. policy makers openly
talking about purposefully provoking a nation in order
to justify a full-scale invasion that would otherwise be
untenable.
If such treachery at the cost of thousands of
American lives and perhaps millions of Iranian lives is
openly talked about within the halls of these
corporate-funded think-tanks, what do they talk about
that isn't on record?
For those who reject out-of-hand
the notion that 9/11 was an inside job, on grounds that
Western policy makers are not capable of such a horrific
calculus, the evidence is here, starring back from pages
of this Brookings Institution report for all to see and
to come to grips with.
In Libya, provocations for NATO bombardment were a rash
of
entirely unverified reports coming from the rebels
themselves and verified lies about aircraft strafing
unarmed protesters.
With the
targeted assassination of Qaddafi resulting in the
death of his son and three of his grandchildren, NATO
appears to have taken "actions that might make it more
likely" for Qaddafi to be provoked into justifying some
sort of wider NATO ground invasion.
If the litany of
lies that set the groundwork for the current NATO
campaign is any indication, even if Qaddafi does
nothing, a provocation will be manufactured for him.
With the operations against Syria still in their opening
phases, we can be sure as military options are brought
to the table, so will appropriate provocations, induced
or manufactured.
United Front Against Iran
An
Iranian Sponsored 9/11 and a change of leadership
throughout the Middle East, page 66 (page 79 of the
PDF)
"Most
European, Asian, and Middle Eastern publics are dead set
against any American military action against Iran
derived from the current differences between Iran and
the international community - let alone Iran and the
United States.
Other than a Tehran-sponsored 9/11, it is
hard to imagine what would change their minds. For many
democracies and some fragile autocracies to which
Washington would be looking for support, this public
antipathy is likely to prove decisive.
For instance,
Saudi Arabia is positively apoplectic about the
Iranians nuclear program, as well as about their
mischief making in Lebanon, Iraq, and the Palestinian
territories. Yet, so far, Riyadh has made clear that it
will not support military operations of any kind against
Iran. Certainly that could change, but it is hard to
imagine what it would take.
Given that this
situation has not been enough to push the GCC to
support military operations against Iran, what
would?
Certainly Iran testing a nuclear device
might, but at that point, it almost certainly would
be too late: if the United States is going to invade
Iran, it will want to do so before Iran has
developed actual nuclear weapons, not after.
It is
hard to know what else Iran could do that would
change GCC attitudes about the use of force unless
new leaders took power in the Gulf who were far more
determined to stop Iran than the current leadership
is."
Quite obviously, "new leaders" are taking power
throughout the Gulf now via the
U.S.-created "Arab Spring," with Saudi Arabia being
tacitly threatened with destabilization in Bahrain and
Yemen, while Iran's axis of influence through Syria and
into Lebanon is being destabilized.
Egypt and Northern
Africa are being thrown into precarious political chaos
as well, with globalist puppets poised to take over and
eagerly pursue any dictate coming from Washington.
This
confirms the worst fears of geopolitical analysts like
Dr. Webster Tarpley who predicted
as far back as mid-February 2011 that the U.S.-created
"Arab Spring" was an attempt
at reordering the Middle East against Iran and
eventually against China and Russia.
Manufacturing
Provocations
Goading Provocations for an Air Strike, page 84-85 (page
97-98 of the PDF):
"...it would be far
more preferable if the United States could cite an
Iranian provocation as justification for the airstrikes
before launching them.
Clearly, the more outrageous, the
more deadly, and the more unprovoked the Iranian action,
the better off the United States would be. Of course, it
would be very difficult for the United States to goad
Iran into such a provocation without the rest of the
world recognizing this game, which would then undermine
it.
(One method that would have some possibility of
success would be to ratchet up covert regime change
efforts in the hope that Tehran would retaliate overtly,
or even semi-overtly, which could then be portrayed as
an unprovoked act of Iranian aggression.)
This suggests that this option might benefit from being
held in abeyance until such time as the Iranians made an
appropriately provocative move, as they do from time to
time.
In that case, it would be less a determined policy
to employ airstrikes and instead more of an
opportunistic hope that Iran would provide the United
States with the kind of provocation that would justify
airstrikes.
However, that would mean that the use of
airstrikes could not be the primary U.S. policy toward
Iran (even if it were Washingtons fervent preference),
but merely an ancillary contingency to another option
that would be the primary policy unless and until Iran
provided the necessary pretext."
Here we see again, the plotting of a deceitful gambit to
goad a sovereign nation into war, a nation Brookings
notes time and time again has no interest in armed
conflict with the United States.
Also notice the first
mention of "covert
regime change efforts" used as a means to apply
sufficient pressure to exact a particular reaction used
for further political escalation and subsequent military
intervention.
Such a gambit has been recently used in Libya and now in
Syria where foreign-support created violence, to which
regimes were forced to react to - the subsequent
violence then serving as an impetus for expanded U.S.
intervention. Brookings notes that such goading must be
done in such a way so as to not raise suspicions of the
"game" throughout the world.
Hopefully, as people read
this written and signed confession of criminal
conspiracy, they will never fall for this "game" again.
Foreign-Funded Color
Revolution
Finding and Building up Dupes for a Color Revolution,
page 105 (page 118 of the PDF)
"The United States
could play multiple roles in facilitating a revolution.
By funding and helping organize domestic rivals of the
regime, the United States could create an alternative
leadership to seize power.
As Raymond Tanter of the Iran
Policy Committee argues, students and other groups need
covert backing for their demonstrations. They need fax
machines. They need internet access, funds to duplicate
materials, and funds to keep vigilantes from beating
them up.
Beyond this, U.S.-backed media outlets could highlight
regime short comings and make otherwise obscure critics
more prominent.
The United States already supports
Persian-language satellite television (Voice of America
Persian) and radio (Radio Farda) that bring unfiltered
news to Iranians (in recent years, these have taken the
lions share of overt U.S. funding for promoting
democracy in Iran).
U.S. economic pressure (and perhaps
military pressure as well) can discredit the regime,
making the population hungry for a rival leadership."
Here Brookings makes outright calls to create the
conditions within Iran, or any target nation for that
matter, that are more likely to create unrest.
They then
call for funding and organizing that unrest and using
domestic, and quite obviously foreign media to
manipulate public perception and perpetuate U.S.-backed
propaganda.
We see this in nearly every country targeted
for destabilization, generally funded by organizations
like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED),
so-called "independent media" organizations and human
rights NGOs that,
"make otherwise obscure critics more
prominent."
The
NED-funded Project on Middle East Democracy is one
such propaganda outlet operating throughout the Middle
East, propagating the official U.S. narrative in regards
to unrest fomented from Egypt to Syria.
Voice of America
is openly mentioned by Brookings within this report,
while examples in Eastern Europe include
Radio Free Europe, a subsidary with VOA under the
Broadcasting Board of Governors upon which Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton sits as a member.
Also note
worthy is Southeast Asia's
NED-funded Prachatai of Thailand.
Together this nefarious global network feeds the
mainstream, corporate-owned media their talking points
which are then repeated verbatim or cited outright as
reputable sources.
It should be remembered though, that
within the 156 pages of the "Which Path to Persia?"
report it is explicitly and often stated that these
gambits are to protect and expand U.S. interests
throughout the region while diminishing Iran's ability
to challenge said interests in any shape, form, or
manner - not promote democracy, protect freedom, or even
protect America from a genuine security threat.
Using Military Force to Assist Popular Revolutions, page
109-110 (page 122-123 of the PDF)
"Consequently, if the United States ever succeeds in
sparking a revolt against the clerical regime,
Washington may have to consider whether to provide it
with some form of military support to prevent Tehran
from crushing it."
"This requirement means that a
popular revolution in Iran does not seem to fit the
model of the velvet revolutions that occurred
elsewhere. The point is that the Iranian regime may not
be willing to go gently into that good night; instead,
and unlike so many Eastern European regimes, it may
choose to fight to the death. In those circumstances, if
there is not external military assistance to the
revolutionaries, they might not just fail but be
massacred.
Consequently, if the
United States is to pursue this policy, Washington
must take this possibility into consideration.
It
adds some very important requirements to the list:
either the policy must include ways to weaken the
Iranian military or weaken the willingness of the
regimes leaders to call on the military, or else
the United States must be ready to intervene to
defeat it."
Quite clearly, after
previously conspiring to implement foreign-funded
unrest, the predictable crackdown by Iranian
security forces to restore order "requires" some
form of deterrent or military support to be employed
to prevent the movement from being crushed.
We see
that this exact scenario has played out verbatim in
Libya, where "protesters" were in fact armed rebels
from the very beginning, the recipients of decades
of U.S. and UK support, and shortly after their
rebellion began, NATO forces were brought in via a
clumsy series of staged pretenses to prevent the
armed uprising from being crushed by Qaddafi's
forces.
A lead-up to the exact
same scenario is playing out in Syria, where U.S. and
UK puppet politicians are menacing the Syrian
government with threats of military intervention
under the "Libyan Precedence."
We see in
reality, this "precedence" had been clearly
articulated in this 2009 report, and is based on a
familiar "problem, reaction, solution" methodology
used by imperialists throughout human history.
In both Libya, Syria,
and Yemen, and in other immovable targeted nations
like Thailand, armed militants are brought in by
opposition groups to augment street protests.
Often
these armed elements are brought in without the
knowledge of the protesters themselves, and in some
cases,
especially in Syria and
Yemen, it appears armed
groups of "mystery gunmen" are clashing with
both security forces and protesters in order to
escalate violence and unrest further.
Should the
escalating violence fail to tip the balance in the
protesters' favor, the violence itself will become
the pretext for the next level of more overt U.S.
intervention.
U.S.
Sponsored Terrorism and Armed Insurrection
Arming, Funding, and Using Terrorist Organizations, page
113 (page 126 of the PDF)
"The United States
could work with groups like the Iraq-based National
Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) and its military
wing, the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), helping the thousands
of its members who, under Saddam Husayns regime, were
armed and had conducted guerrilla and terrorist
operations against the clerical regime.
Although the NCRI is supposedly disarmed today, that could quickly be
changed."
"Potential Ethnic Proxies," page 117-118 (page 130-131
of the PDF)
"Perhaps the most prominent (and certainly the most
controversial) opposition group that has attracted
attention as a potential U.S. proxy is the NCRI
(National Council of Resistance of Iran), the political
movement established by the MEK (Mujahedin-e Khalq).
Critics believe the group to be undemocratic and
unpopular, and indeed anti-American.
In contrast, the groups champions contend that the
movements long-standing opposition to the Iranian
regime and record of successful attacks on and
intelligence-gathering operations against the regime
make it worthy of U.S. support. They also argue that the
group is no longer anti-American and question the merit
of earlier accusations.
Raymond Tanter, one of the
groups supporters in the United States, contends that
the MEK and the NCRI are allies for regime change in
Tehran and also act as a useful proxy for gathering
intelligence. The MEKs greatest intelligence coup was
the provision of intelligence in 2002 that led to the
discovery of a secret site in Iran for enriching
uranium.
Despite its defenders
claims, the MEK remains on the U.S. government list
of foreign terrorist organizations. In the 1970s,
the group killed three U.S. officers and three
civilian contractors in Iran.
During the 1979-1980
hostage crisis, the group praised the decision to
take America hostages and Elaine Sciolino reported
that while group leaders publicly condemned the 9/11
attacks, within the group celebrations were
widespread.
Undeniably, the group
has conducted terrorist attacks - often excused by the MEKs advocates because they are directed against
the Iranian government.
For example, in 1981, the
group bombed the headquarters of the Islamic
Republic Party, which was then the clerical
leaderships main political organization, killing an
estimated 70 senior officials. More recently, the
group has claimed credit for over a dozen mortar
attacks, assassinations, and other assaults on
Iranian civilian and military targets between 1998
and 2001.
At the very least, to work more closely
with the group (at least in an overt manner),
Washington would need to remove it from the list of
foreign terrorist organizations."
Certainly if the United
States went through with arming and funding MEK (and
they apparently did), they themselves would become
"state sponsors of terrorism" - even as they fight
amidst a decade long war against supposedly just
that.
MEK is unequivocally a terrorist organization
that murders and maims civilians indiscriminately
along with their political opponents. MEK is even
on-record having targeted and murdered Americans.
Yet for some reason, they are considered a potential
proxy, and considerations for their removal from the
apparently meaningless "foreign terrorist
organizations" list, is based solely on their
utility toward advancing U.S. foreign policy.
With this we are given full insight into the
unfathomable depths of depravity from which the global
elite operate from.
It turns out that the degenerates
behind "Which Path to Persia?" including,
-
Kenneth
Pollack
-
Daniel Byman
-
Martin Indyk
-
Susanne Maloney
-
Michael O'Hanlon
-
Bruce Riedel,
...most of whom are
regular contributors to the US's largest newspapers,
would see their plans brought to life.
According to
Seymour Hersh's
New Yorker article "Preparing the Battlefield," MEK
had already been receiving weapons and funding as of
2008 for the purposes described within the Brookings
report that would come out a year later.
It would seem even as "Which Path to Persia?" was being
compiled many of the options on the table had already
gone operational. Baluchi rebels residing in eastern
Iran and western Pakistan were also mentioned in both
the Brookings report and Hersh's article.
U.S. support for
this group is quite ambitious. In addition to using them
in terrorist operations against Tehran,
they are also being built up and directed toward
destabilizing and Balkanizing Pakistan.
Fomenting
a Military Coup
Staging a Coup, page 123-124 (page 136-137 of the PDF):
"Mounting a coup is
hard work, especially in a state as paranoid about
foreign influence and meddling as Iran is. The United
States would first have to make contact with members of
Irans military (and likely its security services as
well).
This by itself is very difficult. Because of
Iranian hypersensitivity to Americans, the United States
would likely have to rely on cutouts - third party
nationals working on behalf of the United States - which
invariably introduces considerable complexity.
Then the
United States would have to use those contacts to try to
identify Iranian military personnel who were both
willing and able to stage a coup, which would be more
difficult still; it would be hard enough for Americans
to make contact with Iranian military officers, let
alone make contact with those specific individuals
willing to risk their lives and their families in a coup
attempt.
Of course, it is
possible that if Washington makes very clear that it
is trying to support a coup in Iran, the coup
plotters will reach out to the United States.
But
this is very rare: history shows that coup plotters
willing to expose themselves to another national
government are usually discovered and killed;
furthermore, most of those coming to the United
States to ask for help overthrowing this or that
government tend to be poseurs or even
counterintelligence agents of the targeted
government."
If readers are wondering
whether or not there is a historical precedence of the
United States "mounting a coup," the Brookings report
itself provides Operation Ajax as notable example:
"Although many coups
are homegrown, one obvious historic model of a
foreign-assisted coup in Iran is Operation Ajax, the
1953 coup détat that overthrew the government of Prime
Minister Mohammed Mossadeq and reinstated the rule of
Shah Reza Pahlavi.
To carry out the coup, the CIA and
British intelligence supported General Fazlollah Zahedi,
providing him and his followers with money and
propaganda, as well as helping organize their
activities."
The uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt were apparently
assisted by members of the military, with similar
defections being sought out in Libya and Syria to help
along the collapse of the embattled regimes.
Nations of
Western interest might want to take time to reevaluate
military officers who have had historically close ties
to the United States or who have reason or possible
motivations for turning on their nation during a spate
of foreign-engineered upheaval.
It should be noted that the Brookings report suggests
that all of these options - popular revolution,
insurgency, and coup - be used concurrently in the hopes
that at least one may succeed. It also suggests that
"helpful synergies" might be created among them to
further mire the targeted regime. (page
150, page 163 of the PDF.)
Conclusion
It is inconceivable that one could read the pages of
"Which Path to Persia?" and not understand the current
"international community" as anything less than
absolutely illegitimate.
They contrive a myriad of laws
with which to restrain and eliminate their competition
with while they remain entirely uninhibited themselves
in their own overt criminality.
We also understand that
the United States is not engaged in diplomatic relations
with the world's nations as envisioned by America's
Founding Fathers, but rather engaged in extorting and
coercing the world to conform to it's "interests."
This report represents a full array of options not only
for use in Iran, but throughout the world. In hindsight
of the U.S.-funded "Arab Spring" it is quite obvious that
the methodology laid out in the report has been drawn on
to destabilize and depose regimes as well as instigate
wars of aggression.
Upon studying this report, its
implications for Iran and the surrounding region, we can
understand better conflicts yet to unfold beyond North
Africa and the Gulf. It is essential that reports like
this are made public, their methodology exposed, and the
true architects behind Western foreign policy revealed.
As the report itself states numerous times, the vast
majority of their gambits require secrecy, "plausible
deniability," and that their dark deeds be done "without
the rest of the world recognizing this game."
The world must realize
who the true brokers of power are, and that by
understanding their agenda, we can wholly reject it and
pursue instead one of our own,
locally, self-sufficiently, independently, and in
true freedom.
