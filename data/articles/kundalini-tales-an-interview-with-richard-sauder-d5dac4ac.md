# Kundalini Tales - An Interview With Richard Sauder

Karma One: Some Mind Control victims
- from Kathleen Sullivan to
Cathy OBrien - and less known
victims all agreed to says that they have been guided to underground
military bases, sometimes very weird. Is it plausible or was is a
deliberate set up, a show to intimidate them?
Richard Sauder: There certainly have been many people who have
reported being
abducted, in some cases seemingly by American military
units or intelligence operatives, and taken to mysterious underground
facilities or bases where they have witnessed and experienced highly
unusual events and procedures, in some cases even involving entities
that appear non-human, or perhaps extraterrestrial.
As the numbers of such reports grow over the
years, I am inclined to believe that at least some of these reports must
be credible, and maybe a great many of them. There is frequently also an
element of mind control involved in these stories. In my research, I
have personally communicated with a number of people who have reported
being taken to strange underground facilities.
I can mention the ones I have spoken with
who have already gone public with their stories.
-
Christa Tilton, who is perhaps
best known for coming forth with her story about being taken to what
she called
the Dulce base back in the 1980s,
where she saw very strange technological apparatuses and creatures,
and had many bizarre experiences
-
Melinda Leslie, who is very
actively involved in researching and speaking about this very theme
as a result of her own abductions and experiences
-
Larry Warren, the UFO
investigator and co-author with Peter Robbins of the book,
Left at East Gate, who was taken to
a secret, deep underground base beneath the American military base
at Bentwaters in southern England
-
the mind control researcher and
activist, Carol Rutz, author of the book,
A Nation Betrayed, who has also
written and spoken on these topics as a consequence of her own
horrific experiences as a child and young woman.
In this regard, I might also mention the
writings and research of the late
Karla Turner, whose work also touched
on this question, in part, and with whom I had some very brief contact
before her death.
Of course these experiences and abductions to
underground bases are
staged! In the sense that they are not normal, everyday events, it is
only logical to say that they are staged.
The question is: why, and by whom, are they
staged?
The more I work with these sorts of
questions and stories the more I am forced to question the nature of
reality itself.
It may be the case that virtually everything
that happens on this planet is staged or in some sense programmed by
the directors of the theatrical production called Life on Earth that
we are all starring in. Maybe the directors mostly remain just out of
sight in the wings, or underground. Though there is definitely a mind
control theme that reoccurs in many of these stories, there is also a
genetic theme that keeps popping up too.
Perhaps what you are getting at in your question is whether all human
beings, all apparent human beings, are really human, or terrestrial
humans, at any rate.
Perhaps others have so seamlessly woven
themselves into our race and our reality that they can stage operations
where they move humans back and forth between our reality and theirs,
using the American military, and subterranean military installations, as
one cover for their machinations. Of course this raises the question as
to how much of what we see and recognize as terrestrial human reality
really is terrestrial human reality!
The short answer for me is: who knows?
I have arrived at the point where it is
clear to me that we are positively awash in a sea of misinformation,
disinformation, lies, propaganda, deceit and cover-ups of every
conceivable and inconceivable variety.
Who in their right mind believes anymore
that they can read the daily newspaper or watch the television news
broadcasts and find out what really is happening on planet Earth?
Probably like most people reading this interview I went away to school
and learned from my teachers the facts of and about life, the world,
history, society, the universe, and so forth ad nauseam.
Now I am questioning almost everything!
Karma One: Why the
Mind Control and ritual abuse
phenomenon is so important and take such an extend in the USA ?
Richard Sauder: I suppose the easy answer is that at present the
United States military and economic systems are the most influential on
the planet. Whether that will continue to be the case as we move into
the future is very much an open question. Nevertheless, at present the
United States is the dominant world player and it throws its weight
around very violently.
Apparently, such a brutal and violent system
needs a lot of sacrificial victims to maintain its bloody and tyrannical
reign. One could surmise that there must be malevolent Magicians
practicing their dark arts behind the scenes, and that they prey on the
mental, emotional and physical life energies of innocent victims to fuel
their nefarious agenda.
In a related vein, can it be coincidence that at the time of Spain's
cruel and exploitive imperial expansion into the Americas that
the
Catholic Church was engaged in the inexpressible barbarism of
the Inquisition how many people did
the Catholics disembowel, behead, impale, burn at the stake, draw and
quarter, torture to death?
I would also call what the (so-called)
Christian Church did during the Spanish Inquisition very definitely a
sort of Ritual and Sadistic Satanic Abuse. So I think this is a
recurring theme in history, and the United States is but a more recent
example of this sort of thing.
Don't forget that the role of
secret, initiatic societies has been
intimately linked to the exercise of political, religious and economic
power right down through the millennia. In the contemporary American
case, remember that
George W. Bush is an initiated member
of the very secretive
Skull and Bones fraternity at Yale
University.
From what is known publicly the rites and
rituals of this fraternity are very lurid and macabre. There are
hundreds of initiated members of this secret society in influential
positions in American government, high finance and industry.
We know that the members are loyal to each
other and their society, but we do not truly know the real aims of the
fraternity, which have never been publicly revealed. But if the actions
and statements of George W. Bush are any indication then the goals of
this fraternity have to do with the exercise of raw, naked power with
little concern for law, social convention, ethics or anything else but
brute power.
A type of fascism, in a word. And fascism
is inevitably
associated with sadism, and satanic mentalities
and practices, such as horrific butchery and torture,
political repression, suppression of free speech and thought, and so
forth.
I suppose that's your answer: there is a
faction in the United States that strongly tends in a fascist direction,
and this faction presently has a lot of influence in the government,
military, industry, banking, the mass media, the universities and
religious institutions. It is almost as if to unleash hell on Earth,
these dark fascist forces require sacrificial victims to facilitate
their taking power and control.
It is a very dark scenario, to be sure.
Karma one: It seems that some programmers and mind control
specialists dont use anymore drugs (like in the
MK Ultra times) but use mainly wave
generating machine that influences the mind. Are those machines the
ultimate weapons? Do you know if the « mind reading machine » is
functional and really working today ?
Richard Sauder: Oh, but I think they still do use chemical and
pharmaceutical substances for mind control, especially for mass mind
control here in the United States. To wit, a full 60% of the municipal
water systems in the U.S.A. are treated with fluoride compounds as a
matter of official, public health policy. Of course, fluoride has a
whole suite of negative effects on the human mind and body. It leads to
mental and physical passivity, and makes people more tractable from the
standpoint of political and social control.
I have read, for example, that the Nazis
experimented with
fluoride in the drinking water in the
prison camps during WW-II as a means of controlling the inmates and
prisoners. It gets worse, the American public is one of the most drugged
populations anywhere ever. A very large number of children in the
schools here are drugged by the school psychologists for having
behavior problems or attention deficit disorders, etc.
Millions of people, including a very large
number of children, are taking powerful mind- and emotion-altering
substances such as valium, prozac, thorazine and
many other drugs.
The rate of use of psychiatric drugs in this
society is very high. Please understand that this society is becoming
like a huge mental asylum full of patients who must be cured to be
able to function normally in society. In the Soviet Union they used to
send dissidents to psychiatric wards for reeducation. Here they spot the
kids who cause trouble when they are still 8 or 10 years old and then
the government psychologists in the schools step in and begin the
psychiatric treatment and reeducation while they are still in primary
or secondary school.
They don't wait until they are 20 or 30
years old to drug them. They do it right away, without delay, when they
are still children.
Much more sophisticated than those crude
Soviets, don't you think?
Not to mention the flood of chemical additives in the foods and
beverages that the majority of the population consume. The modern human
being is a walking chemical experiment-thanks to the
food and chemical industries. I have
already mentioned the fluoride compounds that are added to the water in
most American cities and towns now, but the foods also contain many
troubling chemicals such as aluminum compounds and other substances
such as monosodium glutamate, which is a very common food additive and
which in high and cumulative doses causes brain damage.
So I would say that chemical mind control and mind destruction have
gone mainstream. The chemicals are being fed to the population by
the tons, in the food, in the water, and in the beverages that they
consume.
But you are right, electronic technologies that rely on the propagation
of electromagnetic waves are also very much in play. Many people have
focused on the dangers posed by so-called atmospheric heaters such as
the
HAARP system in Alaska, and I share those concerns I might
add, but I think that we should not overlook other dangers closer to our
brains, such as
the ubiquitous cellular telephone (cell
phone).
It seems that people nowadays cannot survive
without going everywhere with a cell phone glued to their head just
one inch from their brain. HAARP may be thousands of miles away in
Alaska but why paste a radio transmitter to your head and zap your
brain with radio waves for hours on end? And yet millions of people do
this.
I am suggesting that maybe a very effective
way to control people with electronic mind control is to persuade them
that to live their life in a normal, modern fashion that they must
personally apply the portable electronic mind control device to the side
of their head as frequently as possible, and as quickly as possible
each and every time that it rings! Quick!!
Anyone who would like to know more about the
health threat to the human brain from cell phones can
find a great deal of information on this topic
on the internet using key search words and any major search engine.
Then there is the more esoteric question, perhaps, of so-called
psychotronic technologies that can
target the human brain very directly to induce auditions and
hallucinations, or extreme mood and emotional changes such as great fear
or blind, animal panic.
There is a great deal of research suggesting
that these sorts of technologies have been and are being weaponized, for
use on military battlefields, and also for social and political control
domestically. I might add that I have been told that the American
military does have such devices that permit the direct targeting of even
the individual human mind.
My research corroborates what I have been
told 100%. Forget about a dystopian future we are living in
a dystopian present. For me, based on everything I have read, the
data uncovered by my research and what I have been told, yes, electronic
mind control technology is very advanced and if we hope to have a human
and humane future on this planet we have to act now.
Not 100 years from now, we must not leave it
to our children to act in some future time no, we, those reading these
words now, it is up to us to act and in our lifetime, beginning right
now.
Perhaps, you are thinking, but I live in Belgium or France or
Switzerland or Italy - surely he cannot mean me? But, oh yes, I do mean
you - you! Exactly you! - whoever and wherever you may be.
Because Pandora's box is open and the
technological demons are loose and abroad over the face of the entire
Earth. These issues, these questions are now our common concern and this
rapid push towards totalitarian control of the planet, and every man,
woman and child on Earth, body, mind and soul, is advancing rapidly.
Act now, while you still have a modicum of
freedom, or prepare to kneel in bondage and accept your chemical,
pharmaceutical, electronic, political, economic and social enslavement.
It's really just that simple. Deal with it or don't deal with it, but
the reality will not vanish if you fail to look at it.
That's the situation we are in.
Karma One: Is it possible to simulate - as the late Jim Keith
used to say - any kind of event, any kind of virtual reality and make
believe to a victim and
extraterrestrial abduction?
Richard Sauder: Yes, I think it is. In my view you can even go
further and hypothesize that the entire experience we have as a race is
a kind of virtual reality. Maybe it is a question of multiple levels of
virtual reality, and some actors within the virtual reality game learn
how to game the game and mirror sub-levels of virtual reality for
their own purposes. I am certainly not the only person to express an
opinion along these lines.
There are a lot of movies, books and articles
that explore this theme.
Who or what finally is behind the big
virtual reality game I do not know, presuming that that is what we are
dealing with - and it is a hypothesis that I take seriously.
Karma one: This question is the consequence of the previous one:
the extraterrestrial abductions dont really exist but they are used as
a smoke screen for Mind Control experiments involving solely military
personal and psychiatrists (and why not, fake and artificial alien
beings)?
Richard Sauder: I think the situation is very muddled and
unclear, and by conscious design. I think there may be extraterrestrials
here, though I cannot prove that. We do know that the CIA and
others have had very serious mind control programs.
MK-Ultra is certainly just the tip of
the proverbial iceberg. I suspect that both human military, and also
non-military non-human agents are carrying out abductions, sometimes
alone and sometimes in concert with each other.
Why? I don't know for sure. I have as many questions as anyone. But it
occurs to me that one motivation for all this abducting and mind
controlling could be genetic and archival, in this sense: geneticists
tell us that something like 97% of the human genome is so-called
junk DNA.
To them, this junk DNA is meaninglessly
repetitive nonsense. I am wondering however, if a great deal of data may
not be concealed in this seemingly repetitive nonsense - racial data,
racial memory, a galactic informational archive, a cosmic memory
bank, if you will. Maybe we are all full of it, and depending on your
genetic line you may carry more or less of certain types of
information that is valuable or meaningful to this or that galactic or
even terrestrial faction.
Maybe as genetic science advances the
marriage of biochemistry, genetics, micro-electronics and digital
technology permit the downloading and intelligent deciphering of the
information encoded in our DNA - maybe
stretching back millions, even billions of years. This information may
be a very hot commodity, for all sorts of reasons, on the galactic
market and right here on Earth, within the super-secret confines of
powerful initiatic societies, or the military-industrial-espionage
complex, to cite but two possible examples.
It does seem possible that the military and rogue psychiatrists may use
screen realities of alien abduction to conceal their own activities.
But perhaps the opposite occurs as well - maybe so-called aliens also
use screen memories, in this case to make themselves appear to be human
military units!
There may also be other humans on the planet who are not of terrestrial
origin, but who also who may seek to cloak and conceal their activities.
The more I learn and research, and the more I reflect, the more it seems
to me that it is likely that there are other planets across the galaxy
with resident human populations. It even occurs to me that this may be
one factor in
the very obvious UFO cover-up. There
are many UFO encounters where contactees report seeing so-called
Nordic aliens, who are completely human in appearance, and
resemble northern Europeans.
Think how explosive politically and socially
it would be if the human population of this planet became aware that not
only is there
life on other planets in the galaxy,
but that there are other human populations out there, and that the
truth of human history is FAR, FAR DIFFERENT than we have been
taught by our alleged academic, religious and political
authoritiesand that human life and human history span the galaxy
stretching unimaginably far back into the mists of time.
Go out alone on a dark, clear night, gaze up
at the Milky Way and ponder that.
Karma One: Valerie Wolff or
Karla Turner made a connection
between two different phenomenon: victims of mind control and ritual
abuses with victims of alien abductions. Is it valid?
Richard Sauder: I think it is. It seems that there was a huge
upsurge in the mind control programs in the post-WWII period, the same
time frame when the UFO and accompanying
contactee and then
abductee experiences began to come to
public light. The military and intelligence agencies have a shadowy
involvement in both phenomena, that is for certain.
The problem is that it is very difficult to
research either of these phenomena separately, let alone together. The
information that has been brought forward for public consumption has not
come easily, but with great effort and frequently at considerable
personal cost. There may be a kind of feed-back loop between the
phenomena, who knows?
Maybe mind control technology, techniques
and manipulation make the parameters of the space-time continuum more
fluid, or open our group mind to other dimensions or realities, like
weakening a dam of consciousness or unplugging a reality continuum. Or
maybe certain facets of the suite of various UFO-related phenomena led
to certain experimental projects in the realm of mind control in an
effort to understand or gain control of the UFO activity that was being
observed.
I don't know for sure, but, yes, I do
believe there is a connection.
Karma One: The Mind Control at large (control through media,
drugs, religions
) could follow an hidden agenda: forbid the human being
to develop a connection with natural phenomenon, the development of
the Kundalini. What does it really mean? Did you find some real and
material proofs, evidences of this fact, the existence of such an
agenda?
Richard Sauder: Well, I do not doubt for a minute that the goal
of all of the chemical additives,
pharmaceutical compounds, electronic
mind control and myriad other methods of body and mind control is to
prevent humanity from achieving its natural, glorious potential. Sure,
the dampening of the Kundalini is part of that.
For me the Kundalini is nothing more
nor less than the conscious, cosmic life force and energy that pervades
the universe from the smallest micro- to the largest macro-level and all
points and levels between. It is at once supremely powerful, and yet
exquisitely subtle and delicate beyond the capacity of the ordinary
human mind to comprehend.
Imagine mind-boggling, stupendous force on
the level of a galactic power source with billions of huge stars and
their solar systems in its orbit, simultaneously intimately informed by
the nimble grace of a delicate butterfly, or the lilting mating call of
a tiny bird rustling in a garden shrub as it searches out a nesting
location on a beautiful spring day, or the intricate spirals of an
infinitude of sub-atomic particles incessantly spinning through the void
of creation for billions of years!
World without end, amen!
That's the Kundalini, and so much more. And it's all alive and bursting
with grace, real spiritual grace, and power and consciousness and
staggering self- and other-awareness that will leave you open-mouthed
with amazement and astonishment. That's what the miserable wretches that
are trying to impose their pathetic totalitarian control over this
planet do not want you to know!
They don't want you to have that! They want
you poverty stricken, on your knees with fear and trembling, vulnerable,
stupid, ignorant, weak, sickly, malnourished, confused, sad, downcast,
exploited, under- and mis-educated, manipulable, helpless,
propagandized.
By way of contrast, the well-balanced and fully risen Kundalini is
inspiring, invigorating, enlightening, uplifting, encouraging, sane,
supremely intelligent, self-confident, bright, energetic, healthful,
cheerful, hopeful, creative, communicative and so forth.
The present rulers of this planet often
despise and persecute people in whom the Kundalini manifests, if even
partially. That is one reason we have had
witch burnings, and so many
other pogroms throughout history.
To my knowledge there have been few, if any, serious scientific studies
of the Kundalini. It is in the nature of modern science, which is very
materialistic and reductionist in its philosophy and methods, to ignore
or ridicule phenomena such as the Kundalini. So I am not aware of much
research or investigation in this regard.
Ideally, one who endeavors to awaken the kundalini using such
techniques as meditation on the chakras, self-hypnosis, chanting,
various types of yoga, etc. should first purify his or her body, mind
and emotions. Otherwise, blockages in the mind, body and/or emotions can
lead to physical, emotional or even psychiatric complications of diverse
sorts, maybe even with fatal consequences.
Playing with the Kundalini is not
something you try for one weekend because you are bored. The energies
involved can be very stupendous imagine an actual lightning bolt
blasting up your spine and out the top of your head! That is what it can
feel like. Now appreciate how such energies could harm someone whose
emotional make-up was unstable, whose mind is fearful, or whose body is
weak, sickly or malnourished.
I have found the books of Gopi Krishna very interesting and
helpful. His
Kundalini awakening was powerful, sustained and
prolonged. Lee Sannella, M.D. has written a little book,
The
Kundalini Experience, from a more clinical and scientific
perspective. These are some of the books I have found helpful and
enlightening. There is a great deal more information about the kundalini
out there in books, magazines and articles, some of it good, some of it
bad a great deal of it is written by people who do not always know
what they are talking about, unfortunately.
In general, I suppose the guide for the Kundalini is like everything
else in life try to be respectful of yourself and others, try to love
the Earth and other life forms, shun warfare, embrace peace, strive to
understand life and the universe and your place in it, ask for guidance
and help, meditate on the heart chakra I believe it to be the best and
master chakra, and have an attitude of reverent awe and appreciation for
the wonder of creation and the opportunity to be alive and aware and
taking part in it all.
Karma One: Scott Peck, a famous therapist in the New Age
circles, author of «People of the lie» gives a certain definition of
the
evil:
the exercise, the use of political power as a way to impose the
will of a person on another by coercion or occult tools to prevent any
spiritual development of the human being.
Peck has invented the concept of a kind of
satanic and strategic policy as a weapon to break in pieces
consciousness. Satanic worshipers and programmers forced their victims
to submit themselves to a system where Good and Evil are equal and ethic
does not exist.
What do you think?
Richard Sauder: It does seem like a project fitting that
description is well underway on planet Earth. There is conscious
malevolence on the part of those who are seeking to exert their
diabolical will over this planet and everything and everyone on it. You
have to wonder if people like
George W. Bush, to cite but one salient
example, can even be described as human beings, so low is their state of
consciousness and so great their willingness, nay eagerness, to inflict
violence and suffering on others.
It is interesting that in several photographs in recent years it is
clear that George Bush is wearing some type of small device, presumably
an electronic apparatus, on his back, between his shoulder blades,
strapped to his body under his clothing. What does this mean? Does he,
indeed, have a portable electronic device strapped to his back? If so,
why? What is it? Is it some sort of life support machine, without which
he would die? Something else?
It is a bizarre situation, but it is readily evident even on casual
inspection of multiple photos that have been widely disseminated by the
news media - and yet - and yet! - the same news media do not even
inquire into this strange reality.
Are we perhaps dealing with a pure puppet, who takes direction from his
handlers via an electronic control device strapped to his back? I
suspect that that could be the case. The President of the United States
is but a puppet for hidden masters behind the scenes who wish us all
very great harm and will spare no effort to subjugate us, all of us, to
their violent, iron will.
Our future depends on whether we bow to their pathetic demands and
accede to their agenda of death and destruction, or , or! - instead
jointly establish a cooperative, peaceful, uplifting, sane, healthy, Kundalini-enlightened culture that takes its rightful place in an open
galactic society full of cosmic potential and joy.
I much prefer the second choice - will you
join me?
