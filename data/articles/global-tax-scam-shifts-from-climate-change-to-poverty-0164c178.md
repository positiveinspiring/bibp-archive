As the science behind
global warming becomes increasingly
discredited and its proponents are exposed as eugenics-obsessed
control freaks who care only about destroying freedom, the effort to make
Americans pay a global tax has shifted from the justification of climate
change to that of poverty.
As we documented on Sunday, leaders from 60 nations will be meeting at
the
United Nations this week to push a tax on world financial
transactions, formally launching a massive program to bankrupt the
middle class and enrich the coffers of global government.
Separately, the leaders of Spain and France are also now calling for new
financing sources with which to build the infrastructure of a one world
government. Remember, this has nothing to do with poverty.
As the leaked Danish text revealed, global
institutions such as
the IMF and
the World Bank have no intention of handing
the money looted from American taxpayers to poorer countries, they will
merely continue to keep the third world in bondage with crippling loans
while withholding the real wealth for themselves.
We need to make more effort to look for
alternative financing sources
that arent as vulnerable as the budgets
of developed countries when faced with crises like the one were seeing
today, said Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.
Both he and French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for some
form of financial tax to raise money to combat poverty, an idea
already rejected by the International Monetary Fund and many Group of 20
major developed and developing nations, reports Reuters.
Although climate change still gets a token
mention in the call for a global tax, the justification of poverty has
firmly overtaken it as the primary ruse via which globalists plan to conduct
a massive transfer of wealth - not to poor nations - but to their own back
pockets.
As the recently leaked UN blueprint revealed, the elite are determined to
use a global tax as just one of the weapons in their arsenal to dismantle
the middle class of richer nations.
In their own words, the globalists talk of their aim to limit and redirect
the aspirations for a better life of rising middle classes around the
world, in other words to reduce the standard of living for the middle
classes in Western Europe and America.
As the opening session paper puts it:
The real challenge comes from the
exponential growth of the global consumerist society driven by ever
higher aspirations of the upper and middle layers in rich countries as
well as the expanding demand of emerging middle-class in developing
countries. Our true ambition should be therefore creating incentives for
the profound transformation of attitudes and consumption styles.
This is globalist talk for dismantling
the middle classes by looting them with global taxes and consumption levies
in the name of alleviating poverty in poorer areas of the world and stopping
climate change.
However, as we have already explained, this is
merely a ruse. The money will not be redistributed to the poor, it will be
swallowed up by the same globalist institutions running the scam.
To achieve their goal, the UN will have to oversee,
nothing less than a fundamental
transformation of the global economy, states the report.
In other words, economic growth will wither and
be replaced by a green economy and a post-industrial revolution.
Since Spains fundamental transformation of
its economy over to a green economy has devastated the country, with
unemployment hitting a crippling 20 per cent, its unsurprising that
Zapatero is now calling for a new global levy on financial transactions in
an effort to force already destitute Americans to pick up the tab for the
failed and economically crippling green measures that he inflicted on his
own country while doing the bidding of his globalist masters.
