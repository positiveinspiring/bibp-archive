# The Hidden Evil - 28

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/hiddenevil/hiddenevil28.htm

Why it Remains
This program is thoroughly covered-up by mainstream institutions. Its
designers had enough global influence to block off all standard escape
routes. This is includes the medical system, the legal system, and worldwide
organizations which claim to exist to help victims.
McKinney's investigation into the claims of this harassment revealed a
general "Failure of 'Establishment' Support Systems."
This makes sense when one understands that the
Hidden Evil is the Establishment's policy. She described that those who
tried to resolve their issues through existing support mechanisms
encountered: Apathy and indifference on the part of congress and state
legislators, attempted discrediting by psychiatrists, lack of interest
and/or competency in legal circles, little or no assistance from police, and
a refusal of both the ACLU and Amnesty International to intervene.
Apathy and Indifference
Congress and state legislators have been contacted by many people. They know
this program exists and are allowing it to continue. They are unwilling or
unable to stop it.
As already demonstrated, congress is subservient
to the Think Tanks.
"They just won't intervene," said McKinney,
regarding efforts to contact state representatives about this program.
Discrediting by Psychiatrists
Some targets that have reported this program to psychiatrists have been
labeled mentally ill.
This tactic was heavily used in Russia, where
they would subject people to the penal and mental health systems who were
critical of the dictatorship. Professor Marrs observed,
"The communists of the USSR were long
engaged in forcing their 'malcontents' - those who oppose the monstrous
authoritarian system - to be 'treated' in crowed psychiatric hospitals."
He continued, "There, confined to a secluded prison ward, they were
treated for 'mental illness' by becoming injected with massive does of
mind... destroying drugs."
"If you go to a medical doctor you do not
talk about [it]," warned McKinney, "because many are also involved."
Some doctors who were aware of existing
conditions of targeted patients deliberately put them on a regimen of drugs
in order to worsen pre-existing conditions.
The CIA is apparently famous for using this
tactic. In his book, Journey Into Madness: The True Story of Secret CIA
Mind Control and Medical Abuse, Gordon Thomas wrote,
"Nothing I had researched before could have
prepared me for the dark reality of doctors who set out to deliberately
destroy minds and bodies they were trained to heal."
He continued,
"The realization that physicians are part of
a killing machine provokes a special horror."
Apparently the Stasi would use doctors to help
destroy enemies of the state as well. Fulbrook wrote,
"There have also been suspicions that
symptoms of mental illness were actually created by 'medical'
treatment."
Lack of Legal Assistance
This cannot be resolved through legal means.
Attorneys will not generally assist. Some have
allegedly deliberately sabotaged cases. In Germany, targets found themselves
in a similar situation; Funder stated,
"There was no room for a person to defend
themselves against the State because all the defense lawyers and all the
judges were part of it."
Police will not assist. Standard practice seems
to be dismissing targeted individuals that report this as lunatics. Some
police acknowledge the existence of this program, but won't intervene with
what they believe to be operations by U.S. Intelligence. Federal law
enforcement will not assist either.
Apparently, the FBI has been contacted by a great number of people who claim
to be on the receiving end of V2K and other Non-lethal harassment, but
dismiss them as, "mentally disturbed persons."
McKinney stated,
"Writing to the various [federal] agencies
and calling and meeting with them serves no useful purpose either
because they will say there are no laws prohibiting these types of
activities."
The ACLU and Amnesty International Will Not
Intervene
Even though both organizations acknowledge receiving many complaints, they
have offered little or no assistance to targeted people.
Obviously, the top leadership in both
organizations has been told to stand down while terrorists and undesirables
are dealt with.
This excuse has been used countless times
throughout history,
"we need to temporarily suspend civil
liberties for some people in order to protect the state."
What this means is that those in charge of the
dictatorship are doing their roundup.
This is standard dictatorship installation.
National Security is very likely the reason used to keep these organizations
from assisting targeted people. This program thrives so the elite can target
anyone who they either dislike or think is a potential threat to their
control.
The government can't control it, because those who created it control the
government, and use government agencies as instruments of persecution.
Compare this to the group stalking program used
in Germany, where the definition of "enemy" increased as time went on.
"The number of informal collaborators, or
IMs (inoffizielle Mitarbeiter), exploded over the years," declared
Fulbrook.
Remember, the Stasi and their colossal network
of citizen informants existed to keep the criminals who ran the state in
control.
According to CNN, this happened until about
1/3rd of the population was targeted in some manner.
Denial and Fear
This is a topic that people may not
want to believe, even though it is true.
Most people don't want to face the horror of
acknowledging that something like this is going on. They don't want to
entertain the possibility that, yes - it's happening again, their own
government has turned into a monster.
When you make someone aware of the possibility
that their government has been hijacked and has sinister plans for the
population they're presented with a choice. They can believe you and have
their world turned upside down. Or they can deny that it exists. Some people
don't have the constitution to acknowledge insanity of this magnitude.
This type of denial is probably an unconscious
protection mechanism that activates in order to prevent a nervous breakdown.
According to Dr. Goleman, this denial may have, at some point, assisted in
our growth.
He wrote,
"In our evolution, our survival as a species
may have hinged in part on our ability to select shrewdly, and to
deceive ourselves just as shrewdly. But the capacity of the unconscious
mind to pilot the conscious can backfire... We fall prey to blind spots,
remaining ignorant of zones of information we might be better off
knowing, even if that knowledge brings some pain."
Professor Marrs summed it up this way:
"Truths that rattles one's nerves and
unsettles one's inner security is truth that must be rejected. It simply
must, or many believe they might go insane - or suffer an emotional
breakdown... Eventually we must either reject it outright and refuse to
listen to the truth, or finally, reluctantly, we are compelled to accept
it, along with all the horrible complications and ramifications that
come with the acceptance."
Apparently even some TIs don't believe the
government is carrying this out.
There are probably several reasons for this.
First, they may be informants whose purpose is to mislead. They may just not
be aware of the scope of it due to lack of study.
Or, they may not want to admit that it's really
that bad. In other words, denial.
"Even amongst TIs there is the perception in
certain areas that our government would not do this," announced
McKinney. She explains this denial as a case of "not recognizing
reality." "First of all," she states, "if this were not being done by
our government, congress would step in because of the... thousands of
complaints no doubt over the past 10-15 years, from citizens who
recognize what's going on."
The masses of people in Germany and Russia were
not aware that a dictatorship was being setup right in front of them. It can
never happen here, right? It'd be all over the news... Entire countries have
been under mind-control in past dictatorships. Professor Marrs contributes
this to a type of denial that has occurred repeatedly throughout history.
He asks,
"If we are descending into a period of
darkness in the world in which [a] totalitarian government controlled by
the few elite is a reality... then why is it hat that masses do not
understand this? The answer," he says, "is that it is characteristic of
a decaying civilization that those most closely associated with it are
unconscious of the tragedy that has befallen them."
Some are fully aware that this program exists
and how well funded, organized, and widespread it is.
They're afraid that they'll become targeted if
they attempt to expose it. Some who have tried to assist targeted people
have become targets themselves. This is too big, widespread, powerful, and
difficult to prove. So the popular and safe response is to pretend that the
monster doesn't exist. Or pretend that it's not really a monster and join
with it.
The bottom line is that this is just too evil
for most people to deal with.
"They don't want to lean the truth because
it would be too discomforting - too alarming," wrote Professor Marrs.
"If they were to accept the fact that much
of what they think they know about their government and its leaders, the
economy, and where society is heading are simply elaborate myths,
concealing and insulating a hidden elite from opposition and exposure,
they would then be faced with a horrible dilemma: What can they do about
it? Even more scary is that it would also become mandatory that they
ponder the question of what will happen to them if they try to do
something about it."
If you're targeted, you may have trouble trying
to convince someone who has spent most of their life watching sporting
events, soap operas, corporate-controlled news, or playing video games, that
this exists.
The people who exist inside these ruts (most
people) are under a form of mind-control. People, including some friends and
family, may deny your claim that this exists. They may just not want to
believe such a thing is possible.
They may tell you,
"you just need to snap out of it and get on
with your life," or "you can't run away from your problems."
Or similar remarks.
The truth is, they are the ones in denial. Or, they may be forced to lie
about its existence as part of a gag order for a bogus investigation. It's
been said that you can't wake someone up who pretends to be asleep. Friends
or family may be forced into lying to your face, discrediting you by having
you hospitalized, and participating in the harassment.
This is the big evil that everyone goes along with when they encounter it
because they believe that once it passes, they'll be OK.
Of course in the back of their minds they're
thinking,
"I hope it never comes for me or my family."
My message to those who know what this is about
is this: It is only getting worse. If you've read the previous chapters on
history you know what they've done. Also, look into the facts related to
9/11. If you keep giving in, it will only be a matter of time before a
family member becomes targeted.
How will you feel when you are forced to harass
your son, daughter or sibling?
Vested Interest
Some targeted people have been in touch with organizations that are devoted
to assisting people who are being tortured and stalked.
They either didn't respond, or they did not
acknowledge that this program exists. I wrote a letter to the author of a
book on stalking, who also happens to be the director of a large, popular
anti-stalking organization.
She responded by telling me that I should seek
help from a psychiatrist. This women's reply also contained hints that I
must have done something to provoke it and that I deserved it.
I checked out her website, and noticed that her organization is affiliated
with a major Establishment institution. If they are affiliated with a
corporation, they are probably receiving some type of funding (grants) from
it.
So, this would be an example of an organization
that has a vested interest in covering up this epidemic. It is possible that
her clinic is also being used for disinformation.
Summary
The program remains because the wealthy individuals who created it and use
it, want it that way.
All standard mainstream support organizations
participate in the cover-up. This includes the legal and medical community,
human rights organizations, local and federal law enforcement, and congress.
In all likelihood, the national security act is preventing these
organizations from intervening.
Additionally, denial and fear may prevent some
from recognizing the situation.
