The
Mark of the Beast (part 7)
(Excerpts Revelations of Awareness 79-11 )
"Branding the Goyim"
This Awareness indicates there is now seen a herd of people being herded toward a pen, in a particular direction, with certain entities carrying laser tattoo branding irons, leading those people toward that pen, that they may be branded. That the majority of these people are walking willingly along, because obedience in the past has always served their security and give them their feed.
This Awareness indicates
there is seen among those people a murmuring, a muttering, a concern, and
the concern begins to grow louder and louder. There are some who are saying
to others, "Quiet! You'll get us in trouble. We won't get our feed."
There are others who are saying, "They're going to brand us!" This Awareness indicates there is seen that which
is a disagreement, a concern, an intensification, and eventually there are
shouts and fights among the people, wherein there are those who wish their
feed at any cost, and there are those who wish their freedom at any cost.
This Awareness indicates there are
many who scatter and leave the herd, moving into the forest and into the woods.
There are others who become organized and move against those who would brand
them, and brand their fellow prisoners. This Awareness indicates that all
of these entities, if awakened, could simply turn to their branders and say,
"You are not going to touch us with that thing." This Awareness
indicates there would be nothing the branders could do, but to back off.
This Awareness indicates that the
problem is the majority of people have consciousness that are approximately
the same as cattle. This Awareness indicates there is a Jewish word commonly
used to describe the Gentiles: that word is goyim. This Awareness suggests
the word goyim means cattle. This Awareness indicates that this is not an
exaggeration or a term to insult: this is rather a term which is quite descriptive
of many entities. This Awareness indicates that the Gentiles often act the
roles of cattle or sheep, and follow through to whatever sacrifice is intended
by their masters.
This Awareness suggest that the oldest
secret organization was controlled by Benjamin, and his family, whereby they
marked cattle for the Pharaoh, kept track of the Pharaoh's cattle, and extended
their action into all the know world, whereby they were the sleepers of the
cattle in all countries.
This Awareness indicates from this,
many other secret organizations began to develop, and have been in power on
many levels since that time. This Awareness indicates this being the oldest
known organization of a historical nature in your present civilizations.
The Future Is
Not Fixed
This Awareness suggests that the
future is not fixed; yet there is that force which is movement, which is on
a collision course with other forces which are in movement, and when these
energies come together, there can be much which is disharmonious as these
energies reach their reconciliation.
This Awareness indicates that there
is that force which has been called the Force of Darkness, that force which
represent those energies which motivate greed, lust, power, and separateness.
There is that force which has been
called the Force of Light, which represent Unity, Service, Love, and Harmony.
These forces have enjoyed movement throughout the universe for eons of time;
and there have been times wherein the Forces of darkness gained power over
the Light Force, and times wherein this has been reversed.
This Awareness indicates that upon
this plane, near the time -- the later part of the Atlantean culture -- the
Forces
of Darkness prevailed and won the battle against the Forces of Light. This
Awareness indicates that this has now come around again and at this time the
Forces of Light will win out against the Forces of Darkness.
This Awareness wishes to clarify:
the Forces of Darkness are those forces which emanate from the concept of
separateness. The Forces of Light are those which emanate from the concept
of Unity. This Awareness indicates that the reconciliation between the Forces
of Light and the Forces of Darkness is that which brings about the Clear Light,
the Energy which is associated with this Awareness, with Love and Mercy, Harmony
and the acceptance of what is.
