# Agenda 21 - Food is The New Gold; Land is The New Oil

Over the last decade world grain reserves have fallen by at least a
third and that decline looks set to continue.
For the last half of the
20th century overproduction was the order of the day. Huge grain
surpluses, butter mountains and milk lakes dominated the news.
During
this period the United States had a farm program where land lay idle
to prevent even more surpluses, this provided a cushion against
shortages, the land could be planted up if the surpluses fell to levels
considered to be too low.
In the UK land was left fallow and green manured to enrich it for the following season.
The crops were rotated
and the harvests were generally very good. In addition there was the
carryover: The amount of grain left in the massive storage silos at the
time the next crop is harvested. Other western nations had similar
systems.
1965 is a good year to show how the system cushioned against
disaster. In 1965 the Monsoon in India failed.
The United states shipped
a full fifth of its grain harvest to India which averted a potential
famine. Due to the amount of surplus in store the incident had a minimal
effect on grain prices on the world markets.
There were occasional spikes during the period of 1950-2000, but the
effects on world prices were a short lived thing. The weather was
usually to blame and after a bit of a 'blip' everything settled down
when the amount of idled land and the amount of food commodities in
store were announced.
In 1950 the world had a population of 2.5 billion souls.
By 1986
world demand for grain was rising rapidly due to an ever increasing
population and the prices were starting to rise.
In an effort to keep a
surplus and to reduce or at least to stabilize the prices, the land
idling programs were reduced in both the United States and the UK,
with other countries following suit until by 1990 most agricultural land
that could be farmed was farmed.
It was in the 80â€²s that someone, somewhere decided that
biofuel was
the way of the future. The global warming con artists that had
infiltrated every layer of governments decided that biofuel was the
answer, that clean, green fuels would stop 'global warming' in its
tracks
well, according to what they say now that wasn't very effective,
the Earth is apparently still warming.
These 'experts' didn't look at
the global picture.
They never considered that the ever growing global population would
require more and more food and that more and more arable land across the
world would be given over to the growing of biofuel crops.
When realization finally dawned that food production could not keep
pace something had to be done, a wide ranging plan was formulated to
sell sustainability, global warming, which was now starting to be
referred to as climate change, to the masses. Agenda 21 was born.
Agenda 21 basically puts the environment above the inhabitants of
this planet.
In order to preserve the habitat of insects and small
animals nobody has ever heard of, certain regions cannot be farmed in
case a moth finds itself out of a home. The scope of Agenda 21 is
massive, and it affects every facet of our lives. Even those of us who
refuse to comply with the
policies of the United Nations are affected
by the rules and regulations of the plan.
It affects our choices on a daily basis.
It affects,
When
Maurice Strong, then Secretary-General of the
United Nations
Earth Summit introduced Agenda 21, 20 years ago.
He said:
"Current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent
middle class - involving high meat intake, the use of fossil fuels,
electrical appliances, home and work-place air-conditioning and
suburban housing - are not sustainable."
At this point the war on carbon dioxide started.
Interestingly
carbon
dioxide is what humans breathe out. Every breath we take in, is followed
by a breath out, from birth to death respiration adds to the carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.
-
Can we assume therefore that this is what is
meant by anthropogenic global warming?
-
Does the
'man-made
global warming' they refer to constantly
actually include breathing as a cause of pollution alongside factory
output?
The United Nations, pushing its quest for
a One World government
fully endorse the ethos of flora and fauna over people.
In fact, if they
can
reduce the amount of people along the way they will be exceedingly
happy about it. What better way to do that than to have 'naturally
occurring famines' that cannot be pinned on the governments of the world
or on the United Nations.
Now although we are used to seeing famines in Africa I think that the
trend is about to change. The peoples of Africa have a much smaller
carbon footprint than we do here in The West, and for that reason a
famine in the West would reduce the emissions that come from our busy,
carbon-fuelled lifestyles far more readily than wiping out the entire
African sub-continent.
We are also less malleable than those who have to rely on foreign aid
for even their basic foodstuffs.
We are more likely to cause trouble, to
fight, riot and revolt if our kids are not fed. Our governments know
this, and in the United States they stockpile ammunition so that when
the time comes they can deal with the situation.
Here in the UK there is anecdotal evidence form serving and ex-police
officers, that the government does the same, but they are far less public
about it.
Trauma and major incident teams across the UK that used to
train for multiple car pile ups and train crashes now train for civil
unrest and riots as well as the more usual stuff. They practice for
dirty bombs and biohazard threats, things the government says we are
facing from enemies unknown.
The pieces of the puzzle are little by little falling into place.
Agenda 21 is advancing rapidly.
-
We are being corralled into smaller and smaller homes that have
smaller and smaller gardens
-
Legislation and ordinances prevent many from saving God-given rainwater on
their own property
-
Ornamental flowers and lawns are to be planted instead of food
we can eat in some US states
-
Health giving raw
foods are increasingly difficult to come by, especially for
those in towns and cities
-
We are discouraged from growing our own food from tried and
tested heirloom
seeds which are increasingly regulated
-
Global food
security is worsening with each passing year and nothing is done
to address the problem
-
Regardless of the government figures decent jobs are becoming
harder to find and as a result we are rapidly moving towards the
time where we will not be able to afford
to feed our families
-
Our just
in time food supply chain relies on increasingly decrepit
infrastructure that will fail sooner rather than later
-
Carbon caps are seeing massive amounts of power stations closing
down which even according to energy industry experts is liable to lead
to blackouts
Food really is set to become the new gold and land the new
oil because without them we are done for.
We have to turn back to the
old ways of producing enough to look after our families. Our children
need to be taught how to grow produce, how to fix things, build things
and generally become more self sufficient.
Those that do well will not be those people with fancy degrees from
Ivy league universities. Those that do well will be those that can make
things that are needed, those who can grow food, those turn their hand
to many things.
I feel confident in my view that an Honors degree in
media studies is not going to be worth a damn.
Regardless of the space you have, and the
conditions you have, I urge you to look into what you can grow for
yourself. Think laterally, think vertically, whatever you have can be
utilized in one way or another.
Every single mouthful you grow you are
one mouthful nearer self-sufficiency and one mouthful further away from famine... famine
that is being systematically induced by
the global elite and their
failure to act in any way, shape or form to prevent it.
