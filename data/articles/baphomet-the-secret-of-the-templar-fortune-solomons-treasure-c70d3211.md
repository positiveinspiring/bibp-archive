In my last article, I wrote about the
hidden alchemical secrets behind the U.S. monetary
system.
In it I explored the Masonic and occult
symbolism of the U.S. one dollar bill. I explained how these symbols acted as
psychopomps directing the mind of its holder to believe in the power and
value of the U.S. dollar. I argued that, due to the nature of our fiat (paper)
currency, and the practice of fractional reserve lending upon which our
banking system is based, it is the faith of the American public, and that
faith alone, which gives the dollar its value.
And this, I explained, is the essence of magic,
akin to the alchemical concepts of turning dross into gold.
Furthermore, the way in which our economy causes
capital to multiply exponentially is similar to the alchemical idea of
creating very much from very little. Such concepts regarding money can be
found in the teachings of Freemasonry, as I reveal in my latest book,
Solomons Treasure: The Magic and Mystery of Americas Money.
But these concepts were not invented by the Freemasons.
They were part of a
tradition passed down from the cultures of antiquity, particularly Greece
and Judea. Indeed, as I explain in my book, the secret wisdom of how to
create and multiply wealth was known to Solomon, and may have been at the
heart of his fabled treasure, purportedly discovered beneath the Temple
Mount by
Freemasonrys historic predecessors, the Knights Templar.
And as it turns out, our modern system of
banking owes even more to the Templars than it does to the Freemasons.
Seal of the Knights Templar.
The Knights Templar were a Catholic military
order created towards the beginning of the twelfth century, and towards the
end of Europes Dark Ages. This was a slow, depressing 1000-year from the
ruins of the fallen Roman Empire to the rise of Catholic Europes Holy
Roman Empire.
It was a miserable time because, after the
collapse of the Roman economy, the use of coinage on the Continent virtually
ceased (the center of world trade having shifted to the Byzantine Empire)
and a feudalist economy developed.
A contemporary illustration
of the execution of
the Knights Templar Grand
Master Jacques de Molay in 1314.
With no real money in circulation, Feudalism
became the new economic system.
From 476 until the emergence of the
Renaissance (put by some historians at about 1350 B.C.), peasants worked
on large manors owned by nobles, where every effort was made to keep the
manor self-sufficient.
On the manor, they produced their own food,
clothes, and tools, and paid their taxes in these goods. Everyone lived and
died on the same manor, just as their father had done before them. Trade
continued in the Byzantine East, but in the West, it was dead.
The only people who were lending out money at all in Europe were Jews. For
many years, Jews had been banned from practicing any profession other than
money-lending. This was not done just because Jews were good with money.
The Catholic credo held the lending of money upon usury to be sinful, but
since Jews were already damned to Hell in the eyes of the Church, they were
encouraged to take on the dirty job of money-lending for the rest of the
community.
But when Jews were expelled from many
communities, of and on, during the pogroms of the Middle Ages (sparked
periodically, when people began to realize how much money they owed to the
Jews), these communities lost their money-lenders.
Luckily, however, the Holy See was inspired by God to grant the Knights
Templar immunity from this anti-usury injunction.
The Templars, or as they were officially titled,
the "Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, were, like many other knightly
orders which formed during the Crusades, at the forefront of the European
struggle to capture and control the Holy Land.
But in addition to fighting, they were also in
charge of fulfilling many practical roles for the community - among them,
money-lending. The Church allowed the Templars to charge interest on loans
at an even higher rate than Jews had been allowed to.
In fact, they were granted a charter that
basically established the Templars as a law unto themselves, accountable to
no one but the Pope.
Thus they were able to operate autonomously at their
various bases throughout Europe. They even had the right to establish their
own sovereign country, which is essentially what they were doing in the Holy
Land when they helped to create the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem.
The Knights Templar had a very interesting entrance policy. Not only did new
initiates pledge lifelong membership in, and fidelity to, the Order, but
they also took very stringent vows of celibacy, secrecy, and poverty.
This
last part was most interesting, for it amounted to the ultimate entrance
fee:
one literally handed over everything one owned to the Order, and vowed
to remain in poverty, donating any earnings one might make after joining,
to the Order as well.
Considering that their knights were taken from
the cream of European aristocracy, the younger brothers of wealthy and
powerful heirs, this was quite significant. It allowed them to amass a large
amount of wealth and land in a relatively quick amount of time.
They then multiplied this wealth exponentially over the next several decades
by investing in various business ventures.
They farmed, manufactured textiles, built roads
and hospitals, and engaged in all sorts of trade. They were responsible for
numerous technological advances during this time, either through their own
invention, or through techniques that they learned through their frequent
contact with Arabs, Jews and Byzantines.
Their business ventures had the effect of
largely transforming Europes economy, paving the way for the mercantilism
that was emerge soon in post-Medici Italy, later giving birth to Capitalism
in Europe and America.
The Templars most significant contribution on this
front was in the field of banking, which became their most lucrative
industry.
The Templars were, first and foremost, the official guardians of pilgrims en
route to the Holy Land. This was supposedly the reason why the Order was
created in the first place. In this capacity, they devised a system to
protect pilgrims from the highway robbery that often made such pilgrimages
dangerous. Instead of loading themselves down with gold and provisions,
which were likely to be stolen, the pilgrims would simply deposit some money
in the form of gold or silver at the Templar preceptory nearest to their
point of departure.
From there they would make their way to
Jerusalem along a pre-selected route consisting of a series of churches and
cathedrals, which were themselves associated with nearby Templar
preceptories, each featuring banking services.
There the pilgrim would present the banker with
a chit:
a piece of paper that was encoded with ciphered information
regarding the pilgrims deposit at the originating bank.
The pilgrim could
then withdraw from the bank at his current location the amount of money he
need to pay for his stay at that particular stop on the route, or to make
donations to the local churches, and could leave the rest in his account.
He could also make direct charges to the account
for any goods or services which the Templars themselves were able to offer
the pilgrim, as was often the case.
It is thus that the word check, or cheque entered into the English and
French languages. Indeed, a great many Middle English words, especially
those pertaining to banking and commerce, seem to have originated in one way
or another with the Templars. In the case of cheque, it was related
directly to the use of the chequerboard clothe which Templar merchants and
bankers used to square their accounts - to check their assets and
liabilities.
The Templars had originally picked up the use of
the chequer pattern from their contact with the East, from whence they also
learned to play chess, and it is theorized by some authors that it was
Templars who originally combined the chessboard (which was not at first
chequered) with the chequerboard pattern, enhancing the deep symbolism that
the game of chess already possessed.
The use of the chequerboard as an abacus became
widespread as mercantilism progressed, and thus the term exchequer came to
mean a treasury, as of a state or nation.
The term check may be related
to jetton, which is the name of the round coins that were often used as
tally chips on exchequer boards, representing various denominations of
money.
They were introduced by the Templars in France
in the mid-thirteenth century.
An illustration of the
Exchequor of Ireland at work
shows the use of a
chequerboard as an abacus
in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries.
As the Templars expanded their banking empire,
and as they came to control many other staple industries throughout Europe,
they quickly became the continents most dominant economic influence.
Never before has a single institution used money
alone to amass so much worldly power. This power threatened not only the
monarchs of Europe (most of whom were now financially indebted to the
Templars), but even Pope Clement V, who was no longer was able to hold the
Templars under the thrall of his signet ring.
Soon the Templars would become a force that no
one could stop, and they seemed to hold allegiance to no one else either -
no earthly power, at least.
Their enemies hypothesized that for the Templars
to have become so wealthy and powerful in such a short span of time, they
would have had to have made a pact with the Devil. With a little
investigation, it was discovered that in fact they had.
When the Templars were arrested en masse on Friday, October 13, 1307, on
charges of idol worship and heresy, there were found throughout their
preceptories various human skulls, and representations of human skulls or
severed heads, which appeared to have been afforded certain ceremonial
importance.
The symbol of
the skull and crossbones, apparently
invented by
the Knights Templar, was used everywhere throughout their possessions.
Carvings depicting a grotesque goat-headed
creature, with a semi-human body at once both male and female, were also
found in the Templars ritual chambers.
In confessions painfully extracted, many knights
admitted that the skulls, the heads and the hybrid creature all represented
their secret god, Baphomet, whom they worshipped because it caused the
land to germinate, and also made them rich.

Baphomet.
Modern occultists, for whom Baphomet is now a
potent symbol, see in this idol a representative of the Universal
Principle, the Azoth or Fifth Element which to alchemists is the key to
turning lead into gold.
This is probably what it meant to the Templars
too.
But to their interrogators, the tortured knights were confessing Devil
worship, and they were punished accordingly. The Order was disbanded, the
Grand Master burnt at the stake, and the offending knights sent to do
penance at various monasteries.
The power of the Templars was crushed.

Satan.
Let us return now to the concept of the Baphomet,
the idol which the Templars said,
caused the land to germinate, and made
them rich.
These claims, coupled with the fact that the
idol was often depicted as a goat with male and female sexual organs, might
cause one to think that the Templars had somehow stumbled upon and absorbed
the tenets of the cult of
the she-goat Amalthea.
This is the creature who
purportedly nursed Zeus while he was a babe in exile on the island of Crete,
hiding from his father Kronos, who wished to kill him.
Having little thanks for the favors of Amalthea,
Zeus had her slaughtered as soon as he was fully grown, and fashioned from
her skin an impenetrable shield called the Aegis. The word aegis or
aigis literally means goat-skin.
Out of one of her horns, he created the
cornucopia or horn of plenty:
a magical object that contained an
inexhaustible supply of fruits and flowers.
So Amalthea was venerated by some cults in much
the same way that the vegetation deity known as the Green Man was in
Celtic culture:
as a representative of nature, of fecundity, plenteousness,
and thus, by extension, wealth.
Similarly, Baphomet was so literally associated with money by the Templars
that they kept small statuettes of him in their money coffers.
But the Baphomet is reported to have done more for the Templars besides just make
them rich. He is also said to have made them wise. In fact, it has been
shown that Baphomets name literally means wisdom in Aramaic, if run
through the ancient
Atbash cipher that was often used by the Templars.
The result is Sophia, which was the name used
for the goddess of wisdom, who was often revered in Gnostic cults in New
Testament times. It was believed in these cults that one could unite
spiritually with Sophia by performing certain rites and meditations, and
thus one could obtain gnosis, or divine knowledge.
Gnosticism was widely practiced in the Roman Empire during Christs time.
One man widely believed to have been a Gnostic was John the Baptist, the
prophet of the New Testament who announced the coming of Christ. John was,
after his death, himself revered by a number of Gnostic cults. There were
even, by medieval times, numerous underground Christian sects called Johannites,
who believed that John was the true Messiah.
Johannite cults even exist today in the form of
semi-Islamic Gnostic sects found in Iraq. It has been charged that that Templars followed this doctrine, and indeed, he was their patron saint, as
he is now for Freemasonry.
More importantly, perhaps, he is known to have
been beheaded at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, and his head, or skull, has
become a central Christian icon. This brings into focus the claim of
occultist
Aleister Crowley that the name Baphomet,
by itself, without running it through any ciphers, means Baptist of
Wisdom.
This could easily have been a title for the
prophet John.
A Masonic device shows the
two Saints John:
the Baptist on the left, and
the Evangelist on the right.
The Baptist strikes the
Baphometic As above, so below pose.
So can Johns head be the skull that the
Templars are said to have not only worshipped, but talked to?
Specifically it is said to have prophesied for
them. The use of a severed head or skull for divination was a common
practice throughout the ancient East and even, though secretly, in Judah and
Israel during Old Testament times. Such devices were called teraphim, and
their use was recorded in the Bible.
It seems possible that the Templars could have
made similar use of John the Baptists head or skull.
How then would the Templars have gotten a hold of the skull of John the
Baptist? Well, during their formative years, the Templars were stationed at
the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, right there on the holy mountain itself.
It was the fact that they were formed there, at
the site of what was once the great Jewish temple, which gave the Order its
name, the Poor Knights of Christ of the Temple of Solomon.
Since the Knights Templar are known to have explored the secret caves
beneath the Temple Mount (looking for the Ark of the Covenant, some say), it
is quite possible that they discovered the head of John while down there.
But how could possessing such an have made the Templars rich? Well, let us
just suspend disbelief for a moment and swallow the Templars own beliefs.
Obviously they believed that Baphomet could talk
to them, and that Baphomet possessed divine wisdom.
So right off the bat, with that belief as our
basis, it is possible to contend that Baphomet taught the Templars all forms
of knowledge, including the mysteries of money and wealth. It is evident
that the Templars did come into possession of great sources of wisdom, which
enabled them to be involved in breakthrough accomplishments of art, science
and medicine during their time.
And the ideas they applied to create their
international banking system were sheer genius.
But more than that, it is clear that the Templars afforded the image of
Baphomet itself a certain ceremonial reverence, accrediting it with a
certain talismanic power, which demonstrates that they believed their
devotion to it, and their sacrifices to it, would gain them wealth in
return. This is a very ancient concept. It is the belief that one can
contact a deity through divination and negotiate a contract with it, in
which one agrees to perform certain services for the deity, in exchange for
blessings in return.
So let us say for the sake of argument that the Baphomet was a talisman of
some sort that, among other things, bestowed upon its possessor wisdom and
riches - or more specifically, the power to both gain and create wealth.
Let us then say that the Templars took control
of this artifact somehow. After coming to possess the Baphomet, the Knights
could have formed a pact with the deity connected to it, they then would
have begun to structure their order into an international system for
advancing learning and science, and for creating wealth. Their wealth and
membership expanded exponentially after they created a formal constitution
for their Order, which could have been an extension of their pact with
Baphomet.
If the Templars did possess this Baphomet, capable of bestowing wisdom
and, more importantly, wealth, this may explain what both King Philippe IV
and Pope Clement V were itching to take from the Templars when they
engineered their arrest, even if they did not fully understand what it was
they were looking for.
It is said that Philippes seneschals searched
frantically all throughout the Templar properties in France, seeking their
fabled treasure, for he knew that the Knights were rich. But he did not
really understand that their wealth was created by banking, and was spread
throughout their domains, invested in various money-making enterprises.
Only a fraction of it actually existed in
reserve as physical currency.
So what sort of economic wisdom could the Templars have divined with the use
of their macabre oracle? As I explained in Solomons Treasure, the
principles of modern banking, which were created by the Templars, are based
upon the idea that money derives its value from faith.
The more you can convince others of the power of
your money, the more power it actually has.
This faith, which gives money its value, is
equivalent to the Azoth or Universal Principle, the pure spirit force
which, in alchemy, makes the transmutation of lead into gold possible. And
this Azoth is, as I have explained, the same concept which modern occultists
now acquaint with the Baphomet.
So the above-mentioned concept could have
certainly been among the ideas communicated to the Templars from their
divine source.

Hermes.
Another idea at the heart of the banking process
invented by the Templars is the concept that money can be seeded into a
business endeavor, or loaned out upon usury, and, through the miracle of the
banking process, grow or multiply exponentially.
As I explain in Solomons Treasure, these are
ideas that appear, allegorically, not only in alchemical manuscripts and in
the medieval Grail romances associated with the Knights Templar, but also in
the Bible.
The practice of tithing contains this principle at its heart, and
many of the parables of Christ expound upon it.
King Solomon, renowned for his wealth and wisdom, knew the secrets as well,
and may have profited from consultations with a demon named Asmodeus.
According to extra-biblical legends, Asmodeus was conjured by Solomon
through magic, and conscripted to take over the building of Solomons famed
temple to God.
The figure of
Asmodeus, as described in Middle
Eastern legends, has a great deal in common with that of Baphomet, and I
believe that they represent the same entity. I see no reason why the demon
that the Templars may have discovered beneath the ruins of the Temple of
Jerusalem could not have been the same demon who built the original Temple
that once stood there.
After all, it was Solomons Temple that gave the
Templar order its name.
Moreover, when digging around in Jerusalem, the Templars may have even come
across examples of an ancient Tyrian coin that is likely to have been among
Solomons treasury. The coin bears the image of a serpent wrapped around a
tree.
This symbol not only denotes the Tree of
Knowledge in the Garden of Eden, but it could also be equated with the
serpent-entwined magic wand of Hermes, the caduceus, which is a symbol of
the alchemical process of transmutation.
It further resembles yet another
well-known symbol of wealth:
the dollar sign.
It could be a coincidence, or it could be
evidence of the continuance of a tradition, from ancient Tyre, to King
Solomon, to the Knights Templar, and eventually to the Freemasons who were
responsible for the creation of the U.S. dollar.
This form of the caduceus is
used by the medical profession.
A common form of the caduceus, a serpent on a Tau cross,
could be the origin of the
dollar sign, according to David Ovason.
Ovason also notes that the alchemical sign for mercury
is very similar to the dollar
sign.

the serpent in the Tree of
Knowledge, another possible origin for the dollar sign.
Another piece of evidence linking the U.S. dollar
with the Templar wisdom of wealth which they derived from the Baphomet has
to do with the number 13.
The Templars seem to have associated their idol
with this number, and it is believed that this is why King Philippe decided
to have them arrested on Friday the 13th of October, as a gesture of
defiance.
The date thereafter became a cursed day. Long after the demise of
the Templars, pirates, many of them Freemasons, sailed in ships bearing the
standard of
the Jolly Roger.
It featured the skull and crossbones, a symbol
used by the Templars to represent Baphomet, beneath which was written the
number 13.
The Jolly Roger.
In
my previous
article, I enumerated the many examples of the gratuitous and deliberate
use of this number on the dollar bill.
Most of these should be familiar enough to any
armchair conspiracy theorist. But this number is not only on the present one
dollar bill. It can be found on the early forty-dollar note , on the first
fifty-dollar bill, and on the first pennies issued by the United States.
13
can also be found throughout the very structure of the U.S. monetary system.
For instance, consider the fact that there are
exactly six types of coins, and seven denominations of paper money,
currently in circulation in the U.S., adding up to a total of thirteen. Then
there is the fact that the Treasury Department was created in 1789, exactly
thirteen years after the birth of the USA in 1776.
The government even made
a point of putting the date 1789 on the Treasury Department Seal in 1966,
almost 190 years after the fact.
The Treasury Seal, by the way,
contains thirteen
stars in its chevron.

featuring the All-Seeing
Eye, 13 stars, and 26 rays.

interlocking rings
and the names of the 13
colonies, with the motto We Are One.
The Federal Reserve has adopted the conspicuous
use of the number as well.
The Fed was created in 1913. It consists of one
Board of Governors overseeing twelve Federal Reserve Districts, and one
central bank controlling twelve district banks, which in turn then control
all of the member banks.
Even the digits of the zip code for the Feds
headquarters in Washington, D.C., 20551, add up to thirteen.

Is this obsession with the number 13 a tribute
to Baphomet by our Masonic founding fathers? Could it be evidence that it is
the Universal Principle, which Baphomet symbolizes, that lies at the heart
of our nations wealth?
Perhaps this is part of the reason why the
United States has become an economic superforce so quickly.
Perhaps the magic symbols on our currency denote
the magic which allows us all to enjoy a relatively prosperous lifestyle in
a nation held aloft by its citizens faith in the power of the dollar.
