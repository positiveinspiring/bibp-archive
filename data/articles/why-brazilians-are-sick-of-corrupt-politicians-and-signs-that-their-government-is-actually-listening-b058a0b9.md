What does it take to drive a million people to
the streets in over 100 cities?
On a short visit to Brazil, I had a chance to
ask citizens that question.
The protests, which have swept the country over
the last three weeks, were initially sparked in Sao Paulo by a plan to raise
busfares. But that was just the straw that broke the camels back.
Anger about,
-
unemployment
-
inflation
-
ridiculously crappy public services
-
billions spent on an upcoming World Cup
tournament
-
rampant political corruption,
...have boiled over in a country that has been
hailed as one of the worlds great emerging economic powerhouses.
Heavyweight Champions of
Corruption
Since the protests began, a new poll shows that
the governments approval rating has tanked by
almost half, to 30 percent, the lowest point in two decades.
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who
leapt onto the national stage by winning the presidency in 2010 as the
candidate of the Workers Party (PT), has been charged with tackling
corruption and pressing social and economic issues facing the country.
But since Rousseffs election, the PT has been
rocked by scandal and the president has had a difficult time stemming a
growing tide of public discontent. Her ratings were on the wane even before
the protests.
In contrast to the response of the
Obama
administration and
New Yorks billionaire mayor to the Occupy
protests, which ranged from indifference to brutal suppression, Rousseff has
actually listened to the protestors who were battered by the rubber bullets
of the military police and has even asked Congress to hold a non-binding
national vote to find out what changes Brazilians would like to see happen.

Her chances of re-election, which are still
high, will be impacted by how she is able to respond to the current unrest.
Brazilians trust the presidency more than the
Congress, but thats not saying a whole lot. To understand why Brazilians
look upon the government as a kind of malignant tumor, you have to know a
little history.
When it comes to corruption, Brazils
politicians are heavyweight champions, making our guys - if you can believe
its possible - look like rank amateurs (see this eye-popping
report in the New York Times).
The legacy of no-holds-barred vice and violence
goes back to the 1960s, when Senator Arnon de Mello calmly shot a
colleague dead on the Senate floor. The killing was considered an accident,
and de Mello escaped punishment. After all, he was aiming at another
senator.
So how bad is the current crop of politicians
sitting in Brazils Congress? Answer: off-the-charts bad.
There was the guy accused of using slave labor
on his cattle ranch back home. Then theres the one who allegedly likes to
have enemies offed with chainsaws and vats of acids. One member of Congress
decided to buy votes from poor women in his district by offering free
sterilization.
Drug trafficking, money laundering, kidnapping -
you name it, Brazilian politicians have done it in spades.
The problem is that members of Congress enjoy
protection from prosecution, and they almost never go to jail. Theyre kind
of like bankers that way, and possibly even more despised.
The entrenched power brokers in Congress are
pretty much deaf to the cries of protesters, and the heads of Brazils
individual states have far more power than, say, American state governors,
so they can block the will of the president.
Rousseff may push for reform, but she faces
plenty of obstacles to achieving anything significant.
But the protesters in Brazil are not without
hope.
In asking how the Brazilian protests compared to
those in other countries, one person I spoke to offered that in his view,
Americas Occupy movement was about hopelessness - the resignation felt by
people whose political and economics systems were unresponsive to their
needs.
He contrasted this with a more optimistic
feeling among protesters in Brazil: many believe that changes may actually
be possible within the existing system.
I also heard Brazils situation contrasted with
protests in other South American countries, like Chile. Chiles protests, in
which people took to the street for four or five years, also started over
busfare, but the reaction of Chilean politicians was much more indifferent
than Brazil's.
Middle Class Demands
More
The wealthy in Brazil are doing just fine, and
they dont have to worry much about the cost of public transit from the
comfort of their helicopters.
They can retreat to their walled villas to
escape rampant violence and crime, like the recent wave
of rapes on Brazils buses.
But most people are not protected from the
problems created by political corruption and indifference to deteriorating
public services. The poor are crushed by the resulting chaos, and the middle
class, though not as devastated, still feels thwarted and angered.
Many Brazilians I spoke to characterized the
protests as the expression of the economic aspirations of a middle class
that has enjoyed a rising trajectory in recent years. In Brazil, inequality
has been on the decline for the last decade, and the middle class as a
percentage of the population has increased.
But stagnation for the last two years, along
with inflation, badly paid and dwindling jobs, and a government that lacks
transparency and responsiveness, has frayed public nerves. In this context,
the protests are viewed as the pains of rapid growth, an expression of an
empowered middle class that is demanding more from the country's economic
and political systems.
Much of the international attention on the
protests has focused on the supposed hostility Brazilians are feeling toward
the national football team and over-the-top expenditures related to next
years World Cup.
But I found Brazilians no less enthusiastic
about their favorite sport - they just want the government to know that they
value things like decent education and healthcare as much as
they do a winning team.
In a country where suspicion of foreign
profiteers has dominated political discussion, a new focus on domestic
inadequacies is a shift that seems to reflect a global trend toward demands
for government accountability and responsiveness.
One man described Brazils political challenge
this way:
How willing and capable is the country to
negotiate tensions arising from unbalanced growth?
The Brazilian protestors can boast that they are
not being ignored.
The busfare hikes originally planned have been
dropped and politicians are at least talking about wide-ranging reforms,
including campaign finance reform and better representation of the people.
Rousseff wants the proposed referendum to take
place as soon as possible and for new rules to be in place before the
October 2014 presidential and legislative elections. It remains to be seen
whether or not this will actually happen.
Underneath it all, Brazils policies carry a
neoliberal strain that degrades public services and tends to fuel economic
growth without taking to account social costs.
A rubber bullet is not going to stop the unrest
that results, and there are signs that at least some of Brazils politicians
may be starting to realize it.
