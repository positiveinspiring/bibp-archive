Chapter Ten
The Sixth step of Discipline
Betrayal; Twinning, Internal walls, Structures, Geometry
This chapter will address the sixth step of discipline in the Illuminati:
Betrayal programming.
Betrayal programming will begin in infancy, but will be formalized
at around ages six to seven, and continue on into adulthood. The sixth
step can be summarized as : "betrayal is the greatest good."
The Illuminists teach this to their children as a very important spiritual
principle. They idealize betrayal as being the true state of man. The
quick witted, the adept, learns this quickly and learns to manipulate
it.
The child will learn this principle through set up after set up. The
child will be placed in situations where an adult who is kindly, and
in set up after set up "rescues" the child, gains its trust.
The child looks up to the adult as a "savior" after the adult
intervenes and protects the child several times. After months or even
a year of bonding, one day in a set up the child will turn to the adult
for help. The adult will back away, mocking the child, and begin abusing
it. This sets in place the programming: adults will always betray a
child and other adults.
Another set up will involve twinning, which deserves special mention
here. The Illuminati will often create twin bonds in their children.
The ideal is to have a set of real twins, but of course this is not
always possible. So, the child is allowed to play with, and become close
to, another child in the cult from earliest childhood. At some point
early on, the child will be told that the other child is actually their
"twin", and that they were separated at birth. They are told
that this is a great secret and not to tell anyone, on pain of punishment.
The child, who is often lonely and isolated, is overjoyed. It has a
twin, someone who has a special bond to them by birth.
The children do everything together. They are taught together, do military
training together. They tell each other secrets. They are also frequently
friends in the daytime as well. They are taught to cross access each
other just as real siblings would be.
But at some point, they will be forced to hurt each other. If one "twin"
is considered expendable, the ultimate set up will be one in which one
twin is forced to die while the other watches. One twin may gather secrets
from the other twin, be forced to disclose them to a trainer or cult
leader, then may be forced to kill the other. One twin may be forced
to hit, or hurt the other. If they refuse, the other twin will be brutalized
by the trainer, and the refusing twin told that the child was hurt because
of their refusal to comply. Many setups will involve one twin being
forced to betray the other, turning on the other child after intense
programming. This betrayal set up will devastate both children, and
they will learn the true lesson: trust no one. Betray, or be betrayed.
The children will also have adult role models on every hand, since
the cult is a very political, hierarchical, back stabbing society. Adults
are constantly betraying each other, stepping over each other to move
up. The children will watch one adult being praised, advanced, because
they betrayed others below them, or set them up to fail. The children
will learn quickly to mimic the adults around them, and both adults
and children can become quite cynical as to human nature. They will
have seen it at its worst, whether in training sessions, the brutality
of a C.O. in military, or the gossip and back stabbing that occurs before
and after rituals. They also incorporate the message internally: play
the game, or be run over. Even the youngest children learn to manipulate
others adeptly, at a very young age, while the adults laugh at how quickly
they are learning adult ways. People manipulation is considered a fine
art in the cult, and those who do it best, as in any group, often win
out.
Suggestions
Betrayal programming may have totally shattered the survivor's trust
in outside people. It will take a therapist a long, long time to gain
the survivor's trust. These are people who were taught over and over
again that talking, sharing one's secrets, would be punished harshly.
Inside littles will be very cautious at first, not trusting that the
therapist is not just another trainer who will one day shout "aha!"
and betray them if they begin to trust. This trust building takes time
and patience, and must be earned through session after session where
the therapist shows trustworthiness and non abusiveness. Survivors will
test therapists over and over again, to see if they really are what
they say they are. This is a normal part of the therapy process. Survivors
may even try to back away from therapy, or outside support, as true
caring support will "wig them out", i.e. conflict incredibly
with their world view and experiences prior to leaving the cult.
Both survivor and therapist need to realize that some amount of distrust
is healthy, based on what the survivor has experienced, and may be life
saving, helping to protect them from outside accessing. Honor this need
and be patient while the survivor tests over and over. The survivor
can try to reason with inside alters who may have been betrayed to the
point of legitimate paranoia. They may ask them to watch, and see what
the therapist, and/or support person is like. To take their time, check
them out. To be aware that what they went through may magnify normal
feelings of caution. Helping orient these parts to outside reality,
and especially positive experiences of trusting a little, and not being
harmed, will help make great strides in undoing this. The survivor may
feel confusion and internal conflict, as they experience a world where
trust is possible. They may pull away, or the reverse, become highly
dependent on the therapist and share too quickly due to a longing for
safe intimacy that has never been met. Setting healthy boundaries while
acknowledging needs will help the survivor through this stage.
Another type of programming involves the deliberate creation of internal
structures within the cult member.
Internal structures: temples, eyes, mirrors, carousels
etc.
The Illuminati trainers will try to create internal structures within
the person's personality systems. Why? They believe this creates better
stability. It also gives the alters and fragments a place to "hang
on to" inside, and creates a convenient way to call them up. If
a fragment is indexed inside to an internal helix, for example, the
trainer knows how to locate them more easily.
Internal structures will vary greatly depending on the trainer, the
group, the region of the U.S. or Europe and the goals for the individual.
Common internal structures will include, but are not limited to:
Temples: these are often consecrated to principle Illuminati deities,
and spiritual alters will congregate here. This may represent actual
temples, Masonic or private, that the subject may have visited.
Temple of Moloch will be created out of black stone with a fire burning
internally.
All seeing eye of Horus: one of the most common structures in an Illuminati
system; universal. Horus is a deity revered by the Illuminati, and the
all seeing eye internally represents the fact that the cult can always
see what the individual is doing. It will also represent being given
to Horus in a high ceremony. The eye may be closed, or open, depending
on the system's status at the time. This eye will also be linked to
demonic watching of the person's activities at all time.
Pyramids: the Illuminati revere ancient Egyptian symbology, especially
"mystery religion" and Temple of Set teachings. Pyramids will
be placed internally both for stability (a triangle, and/or pyramid
represents strength and stability), and as a calling place for the demonic.
Pyramids and triangles, and the number three, represent calling up the
demonic in Illuminist philosophy.
Sun: represents Ra, the sun god
Geometric figures: configurations of circles, triangles, pentagons,
etc. Geometric patterns are considered sacred, and are based in ancient
philosophy. There may be hundreds overlapping in a training grid for
complex systems, which will house fragments in each one.
Training grids: these may be simplistic, such as cubes with patterns
on them, rows of boxes, or more complex such as helixes, double helixes,
infinity loops. Each trainer will have favorites classified as simple,
medium and complex, depending on the child and its ability to recall
and memorize.
Columns: Greek Doric, ionic columns. Often hold "time travel"
programming, with a portal between two columns.
Computers: complex, highly dissociated systems with alters and fragments
held within a computer system.
Robots: may be seen in older systems
Crystals: gems, balls, multifaceted. Used in spiritual systems to enhance
occult powers. Alters and fragments may congregate on facets of a large
ball.
Mirrors: used internally to reinforce other programming sequences,
internal twinning, and distortion of reality programming. May create
shadow systems of functional systems. May also lock in demonic programming.
Carousels: used in some programming sequences to confuse alters inside.
Often linked to spin, confusion programming internally. May be used
to punish internal alters; they will be spun on the carousel if they
tell.
Deck of cards: this can include cards from a deck, or complex configurations
made of hundreds of card inside. Dominoes programming is similar. All
touch each other and if person tries to dismantle programming, the deck
will "fall".
Black boxes: represent self destruct and shatter programming sealed
off into a black box to protect system. Should not be opened without
careful preparation and good therapy.
Mines, booby traps: see above
Spider webs: represent linked programming, with a spider (internal
programmer) who continuously reweaves the web and reinforces internal
programming and punishments. The web also communicates with other systems.
Can also represent demonic linkages internally, woven in.
Internal training rooms: used as punishments for internal alters. Will
represent external training rooms person has been in.
Internal walls: these will often represent very large internal amnesia
barriers.
The walls may be very thick, impermeable or semi permeable. A typical
use for a wall will be to maintain high levels of amnesia between "front"
or daily living, amnesic alters, and "back" or cult active
alters that contain more of the person's life history. The back may
be able to selectively see over and cross past the wall, but the front
will be completely unaware that there is a wall, or what lays behind
it.
Seals: usually in a group of six or seven, represent demonic sealing,
and may cover end times, shatter programming, as well as role within
cult in new hierarchy.
These are some common programming structures. Again, there are many,
many other types of internal structures used and the number and type
are only limited by the trainer's and survivor's creative abilities.
The way that these structures are placed within the person are fairly
similar. Under drugs, hypnosis and electroshock, the person is traumatized
into a deep trance state. In the deep trance they will be told to open
their eyes and look at: either a projected image of the structure, a
3D model of it, or a holographic image using a virtual reality headset.
The image will be ground in, using shock and bringing the image closer
and closer to the person's visual field. It may be rotated, if graphics
are available, or a 3D is used. They may be told that they are entering
inside it, if it is a temple or pyramid, under deep hypnosis, that they
(the alter being programmed) will now "live inside" the structure/box/card,
etc. This will also be used to reinforce amnesia and isolation programming
internally, since the structure will be used to reinforce walls between
the alter/ fragment and other alters and fragments internally.
Suggestions
If the survivor finds structures inside, it will help for them first
of all to try and realize WHY they are there. What purpose do they serve?
To reinforce amnesia? Isolation? spiritual programming? punishment?
To hold dangerous programming sequences? This is important, since some
structures such as internal walls or barriers may have been created
not only by the cult, but reinforced by the survivor as well, as a means
of internal protection. The survivor may not want to dismantle internal
structures too quickly without knowing their purpose and what they contain.
Both the survivor and the therapist will need to go slowly. Learning
how the structures were put in and which alters are linked to the structure,
will be a first step. Long, slow and careful preparation, with lots
of system cooperation, will be needed to look at some structures. This
may only come after years of extensive therapy. Each survivor will progress
at their own pace. If a wall is present, taking it down slowly, one
brick at a time, or allowing part of it to become semi permeable, may
be first steps in healing. Training rooms can have the equipment turned
off and dismantled; it can be turned into a safe room, redecorated and
refitted with toys and safe objects. Computers can slowly begin to realize
that they are human, and gradually allowed to take on human characteristics.
Survivors can use their creativity to reclaim themselves, with the
support of their therapists, and undo what was done.
