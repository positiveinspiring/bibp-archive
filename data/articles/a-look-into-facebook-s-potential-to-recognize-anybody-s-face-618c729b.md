Social media companies like
Facebook
won't talk about who can
access face-tagging data.
That silence is a problem,
privacy advocates say.
Revelations about NSA spying have left
people wondering about the privacy of their digital data.
But what about the privacy of their faces?
The movies make facial recognition look easy: In
the 1998 film
Enemy of the State, a team of NSA
agents simply freeze a surveillance tape, tap some keys and identify the
face a few computer beeps later.
But
Neeraj Kumar, an expert in computer
vision at the University of Washington, says we're nowhere close to just
grabbing anybody's face off a security camera and coming up with a name.
Facial recognition has become pretty good at
one-to-one comparisons - for instance, checking your face against the photo
on your company ID. The accuracy is up to 95 percent.
But that's not so good if you're trying to come
up with a name, and you're comparing one photo against many possible
matches.
"Each time you do a comparison, there's 5
percent chance that it's wrong," Kumar says.
"And that adds up. In fact, it multiplies
up. Very quickly, you find that a 95 percent accuracy leads to pretty
terrible results when you're actually trying to answer the question of,
'Who is this person?' "
Universal Challenges
That's a hard question for a computer.
It's even harder when you ask it to identify a
face in what experts call an "image from the wild."
"You're looking at surveillance-type images
from low-resolution cameras," says Manuel Cueva, a Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputy who trains officers in their facial recognition system.
"If the image is such poor quality, you may
not get any results, period."
The software can get confused by shadows and
weird angles. Even a goofy smile can throw it.
So that's problem one.
Problem two in this quest for universal facial
recognition is that the software needs to compare one picture to another. In
LA County, for instance, officials will run the image against their booking
photos - about 6 million mug shots.
But if you've never been arrested in LA County,
their system won't name you. And that's usually the end of it.
"There really isn't a set standard that we
follow to be able to extend our searches into other jurisdictions,"
Cueva says.
Some agencies and states are working to increase
sharing of mug shots and department of motor vehicles photos. But as of
right now, we simply don't have a universal database of faces.
Or... do we?
A Billion Custom Facial
Models
Look at Facebook, says Amie Stepanovich,
director of the domestic surveillance project at the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington, D.C.
Facebook has the largest biometric database
in the world,
"and it's all been formed by people
voluntarily submitting pictures to Facebook and identifying who they
belong to," she says.
Theoretically, every time you label faces by
tagging a picture, you're chipping away at those two big challenges for
universal facial recognition.
First, you're helping to build a super-database
of labeled faces.
Second, you're uploading multiple versions of
each person's face, which can improve a system's accuracy.
"If you had lots of photos of each person...
you could build a model for Martin, a model for me, a model for other
people. Now you have a custom-tuned model for each person," Kumar, from
the University of Washington, says.
Multiply that by a billion - a billion
custom-tuned facial "models."
Facebook would not answer NPR's questions about
what it does with facial recognition information; social media companies
rarely talk about their internal systems.
But they're surely aware of their huge
database's potential. Last year, Facebook bought Face.com, whose company's
founders had published a paper titled "Leveraging
Billions of Faces to Overcome Performance Barriers in Unconstrained Face
Recognition."
Transparency And
Possibility
Stepanovich wants social media companies to
explain how facial models can be used.
On Facebook, for example, you can't identify
faces of people who aren't already your "friends," but she wonders if,
behind the scenes, Facebook can do broader searches - say, at the request
of the government.
"As we're seeing specifically over the past
few months, no matter how much a company attempts to protect your
privacy, if they're collecting information about you, that information
is vulnerable to government search," Stepanovich says.
Facebook won't say whether this is
technically possible; Google, which offers the competing Google Plus
service, also won't comment on the record about the feasibility of broader
face searches.
Kumar doubts anyone is doing universal searches
of Facebook faces. He says the numbers are just too big.
However, if social media companies are able to
narrow the search - say, if they can compare a photo with the facial models
of everybody who "likes" NPR, or everybody who lives in Des Moines - then,
Kumar says, you'd have the makings of a useful search tool.
