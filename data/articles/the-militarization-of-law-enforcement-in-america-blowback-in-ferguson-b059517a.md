The fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager
and the ensuing protests in Ferguson, Missouri has rocked America. Even
the
mainstream media with its aversion to the truth, has been forced to address
the militarization of the police in America - albeit years too late.
This is a short call from informing the
mainstream media that the country has been living under pseudo martial law
for decades.
On April 13, 2013, the ACLU (Shasta Chapter)
invited me to be their keynote speaker to talk about government secrecy,
drones and militarization of America. The Ferguson shooting and its coverage
it the media prompted me to highlight some of the points made during that
talk as they relate to today's events.
Historians and political scientists have warned
about dangerous war fever sweeping the United States.
America's
entanglements overseas, its imperial ambitions, and the more recent "global
war on terror", a war of indefinite duration against an ill-defined shifting
enemy, with no specific definition of victory, poses a grave danger to the
very character of American government and society, unraveling the fabric of
the Constitution.
The framers of the Constitution recognized such
dangers when they carefully subordinated the military to civilian authority
and attempted to limit the power of the President to initiate war.
Gregory Foster, a former Army officer and West
Point graduate who now teaches national security studies at the
National
Defense University in Washington said that the principle of civilian
control of the military - an early building block of American democracy
- has been reversed and become the civilian subjugation to the military.
Over half a century ago, Supreme Court Justice
Robert Jackson concluded,
"by giving way to the passion, intolerance
and suspicions of wartime, it is easy to reduce our liberties to a
shadow, often in answer to exaggerated claims of security."
That day is here. Aside from constant
surveillance, and the notorious "kill list", war has been internalized and
the militarization of the police force has put every American in danger.
The
biggest threat to Americans now comes from those who are paid to protect
them. A threat which has been building for decades.
During the
Clinton administration Congress
passed what's now known as the "1033 Program." The 1033 Program formalized
Reagan administration's directive to the Pentagon to share surplus military
gear with domestic police agencies.
Since then, millions of pieces of
military equipment designed for use on a battlefield have been transferred
to local cops - SWAT teams and others - including machine guns, tanks, and
armored personnel carriers. The Pentagon's 1033 program has exploded under
Obama.
Clinton also created the "Troops to Cops"
program, which offered grants to police departments who hired soldiers
returning from battle, contributing even further to the militarization of
the police force. But what is most alarming about the militarize police
their training.
Although the role of the police is to
'protect and to serve', they are being taught to kill. Lt. Col David
Grossman (retired U.S. Army) is one such teacher.
Grossman, unapologetically, told
Front Line:
"Prior preparation is the heart of what I
do. I teach law enforcement. Today I just came from a conference where I
trained 700 SWAT cops. And most of what I do is I train military and law
enforcement in what I call the bulletproof mind.
Just as today we have
body armor that the guys in World War II didn't have, the same way we
can have mental preparation that they didn't have. And this bulletproof
mind is vital. Prior preparation is that one variable in the equation
that we can control ahead of time, and one of the key things is
embracing the responsibility to kill."
"I tell my soldiers, I tell my cops: 'You've
got the most difficult decision any human being will ever face. You have
to decide whether or not to kill another human being'."
Well equipped, trained, and encouraged by the
likes of [now former] Mayor Michael
Bloomberg and New York City police commissioner Raymond
Kel who proudly brag of "hav(ing)
my own army in the NYPD" and who used that army to "spy
on peaceful Occupy Wall Street protestors", it should come as no
surprise that a SWAT
team should blow a hole in a 2-year old, or the police kill an unarmed
teenager, and all other horrific acts of violence we witness every day being
committed by the cops.
So why has the media been silent on the
militarization of police up to this point?
Well, they are the watchdogs of
acceptable ideological messages, responsible for manufacturing consent.
Their goal is to control the news and information available to society by
using censorship and propaganda. Big media is not designed to serve the
welfare of the public.
So why break the silence now?
The internet has
made it virtually impossible to hide facts, and quite possibly, mainstream
media has decided to do some damage control and take over the reins in order
to control the flow of information. Regardless of what big media wants us to
believe, what we witness is a blowback.
Our wars have come home to roost.
