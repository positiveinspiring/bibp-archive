The Obama regime, in coordination with its allies and proxies, has
re-launched a virulent world-wide campaign to destroy independent
governments, encircle and ultimately, undermine global competitors, and
establish a new US - EU centered world order.
We will proceed by identifying the recent 'cycles' of US empire-building;
the advances and retreats; the methods and strategies; the results and
perspectives.
Our main focus is on the imperial dynamics
driving the US toward greater military confrontations, up to and including
conditions which can lead to a world war.
Recent Imperial Cycles
US empire-building has not been a linear process.
The recent decades provide ample evidence of
contradictory experiences. Summarily we can identify several phases in which
empire-building has experienced broad advances and sharp setbacks - with
certain caveats.
We are looking at global processes, in which
there are also limited counter-tendencies: In the midst of large-scale
imperial advances, particular regions, countries or movements successfully
resisted or even reversed the imperial thrust.
Secondly, the cyclical nature of empire-building
in no way puts in doubt the imperial character of the state and economy and
its relentless drive to dominate, exploit and accumulate.
Thirdly, the methods and strategy directing each
imperial advance differ according to changes among targeted countries.
Over the past thirty years we can identify three phases in empire-building.
Imperial Advance
1980's to 2000
In the period roughly from the mid-1980's to the year 2000, empire-building
expanded on a global scale.
-
Imperial Expansion in the former
Communist regions
The US and EU,
-
penetrated and hegemonized
Eastern Europe
-
disintegrated and pillaged
Russia and the USSR
-
privatized and denationalized
hundreds of billions of dollars worth of public enterprises,
mass media outlets and banks
-
incorporated military bases
throughout Eastern Europe into NATO
-
established satellite regimes as
willing accomplices in imperial conquests in Africa, the
Middle East and Asia.
-
Imperial Expansion in Latin America
Beginning from the early 1980's to the end of the century,
empire-building advanced throughout Latin America under the formula
of "free markets and free elections".
From Mexico to Argentina, empire-centered, neo-liberal regimes
privatized and denationalized over 5,000 public enterprises and
banks, benefiting US and European multi-nationals. Political leaders
lined up with the US in international forums.
Latin American generals responded
favorably to US-centered military operations.
Bankers extracted billions in debt
payments and laundered many billions more in illicit money.
The US-centered, continent-wide "North
American Free Trade Agreement" appeared to advance according to
schedule.
-
Imperial Advances in Asia and Africa
Communist and nationalist regimes shed their leftist and
anti-imperialist policies and opened their societies and economies
to capitalist penetration.
In Africa, two key "leftist" countries,
Angola and post-apartheid South Africa adopted "free market
policies".
In Asia, China and Indo-China moved decisively toward capitalist
development strategies; foreign investment, privatizations and
intense exploitation of labor replaced collectivist egalitarianism
and anti-imperialism.
India, and other state-directed
capitalist countries, like South Korea, Taiwan and Japan,
liberalized their economies.
Imperial advances were accompanied by
greater economic volatility, a sharpening of the class struggle and
an opening of the electoral process to accommodate competing
capitalist factions.
Empire-building expanded under the slogan of "free markets and fair
elections" - markets dominated by giant multi-nationals and
elections, which assured elite successes.
Imperial Retreat and
Reverses - 2000-2008
The brutal costs of the advance of empire led to a global counter-tendency,
a
wave of anti-neoliberal uprisings and
military resistance to US invasions.
Between 2000-2008 empire-building was under
siege and in retreat.
Russia and China
Challenge the Empire
US empire-building ceased to expand and conquer in two strategic regions:
Russia and Asia.
Under the leadership of President Vladimir
Putin, the Russian state was reconstructed; pillage and disintegration
was reversed. The economy was harnessed to domestic development. The
military was integrated into a system of national defense and security.
Russia once again became a major player in
regional and international politics.
China's turn toward capitalism was accompanied by a dynamic state presence
and a direct role in promoting double digit growth for two decades: China
becoming the second largest economy in the world, displacing the US as the
major trading partner in Asia and Latin America.
The US economic empire was in retreat.
Latin America - The
End of the Neo-Liberal Empire
Neo-liberalism and US-centered 'integration' led to pillage, economic crises
and major popular upheavals, leading to the ascendancy of new center-left
and left regimes.
'Post neo-liberal' administrations emerged in,
-
Bolivia
-
Venezuela
-
Ecuador
-
Brazil
-
Argentina
-
Central America
-
Uruguay
US empire-builders suffered several strategic
defeats.
The US effort to secure a continent-wide free trade agreement fell apart and
was replaced by regional integration organizations that excluded the US and
Canada.
In its place, Washington signed bi-lateral
agreements with,
-
Mexico
-
Colombia
-
Chile
-
Panama
-
Peru
Latin America diversified its markets in Asia
and Europe: China replaced the US as its main trading partner.
Extractive development strategies and high
commodity prices financed greater social spending and political
independence.
Selective nationalizations, increased state regulation and debt
renegotiations weakened US leverage over the Latin American economies.
Venezuela, under President Hugo Chavez successfully challenged US
hegemony in the Caribbean via regional organizations.
Caribbean economies achieved greater
independence and economic viability through membership in PETROCARIBE, a
program through which they received petrol from Venezuela at subsidized
prices.
Central American and Andean countries increased
security and trade via the regional organization, ALBA. Venezuela provided
an alternative development model to the US-centered neo-liberal approach, in
which earnings from the extractive economy financed large-scale social
programs.
From the end of the Clinton Administration to the end of the Bush
Administration, the economic empire was in retreat.
The empire lost Asian and Latin American markets
to China. Latin America gained greater political independence. The Middle
East became 'contested terrain'. A revised and stronger Russian state
opposed further encroachments on its borders.
Military resistance and defeats in Afghanistan,
Somalia, Iraq and Lebanon challenged US dominance.
Imperial Offensive -
Obama's Advances the Empire
The entire period of the
Obama regime
has been taken up with reversing the retreat of empire-building.
To that end Obama has developed a primarily
military strategy,
-
confrontation and encircling China and
Russia
-
undermining and overthrowing independent
governments in Latin America and re-imposing neo-liberal client
regimes
-
launching covert and overt military
assaults on independent regimes everywhere
The empire-building offensive of the 21st
century differs from that of the previous decade in several crucial ways:
Neo-liberal economic doctrines are discredited and electorates are not so
easily convinced of the beneficence of falling under US hegemony.
In other words, empire-builders cannot rely on
diplomacy, elections and free market propaganda to expand their imperial
reach as they did in the 1990's.
To reverse the retreat and advance 21st century empire-building, Washington
realized it had to rely on force and violence. The Obama regime allocated
billions of dollars to finance arms for mercenaries, salaries for street
fighters and campaign expenses for electoral clients engaged in
destabilization campaigns.
Diplomatic duplicity and broken agreements
replaced negotiated settlements - on a grand scale.
Throughout the Obama period not a single imperial advance was secured via
elections, diplomatic agreements or political negotiations. The Obama
Presidency sought and secured the massification of
global spy
network (NSA) and the almost daily
murder of political adversaries via drones and other means.
Covert killer operations under the US Special
Forces expanded throughout the world. Obama assumed dictatorial
prerogatives, including the power to order the arbitrary assassination of
U.S. citizens.
The unfolding of the Obama regime's global effort to stem the imperial
retreat and re-launch empire-building "pivoted" almost exclusively on
military instruments:
Thugs, mobs, Islamist terrorists, Zionist
militarists and a medley of retrograde separatist assassins were the tools
of imperial advance.
The choice of imperial proxies varied according
to time and political circumstances.
Confronting and
Degrading China - Military Encirclement and Economic Exclusion
Faced with the loss of markets and the challenges of China as a global
competitor, Washington developed two major lines of attack:
-
An economic strategy designed to deepen
the integration of Asian and Latin America countries in a free trade
pact that excludes China (the Trans Pacific Trade Agreement)
-
Pentagon-designed military plan Air-Sea
Battle , which targets China's mainland with a full-scale air and
missile assault if Washington's current strategy of controlling
China's commercial maritime lifeline fails (FT, 2/10/14).
While an offensive military strategy is still on
the Pentagon's drawing board, the Obama regime is building up its maritime
armada a few short miles off China's coast, expanding its military bases in
the Philippines, Australia and Japan and tightening the noose around China's
strategic maritime routes for vital imports like oil, gas and raw materials.
The US is actively promoting an Indo-Japanese military alliance as part of
its strategy of military encirclement of China.
Joint military maneuvers, high-level military
coordination and meetings between Japanese and Indian military officials are
seen by the Pentagon as strategic advances in isolating China and
reinforcing the US stranglehold on China's maritime routes to the Middle
East, Southeast Asia and beyond.
India, according to one of India's leading
weeklies, is viewed,
"as a junior partner of the US. The Indian
Navy is fast becoming the chief policeman of the Indian Ocean and the
Indian military's dependence on the U.S. military-industrial complex is
increasing
"
(Economic and Political Weekly (Mumbai),
2/15/14, p. 9.
The US is also escalating its support for
violent separatist movements in China, namely the Tibetans, Uighurs and
other Islamists.
Obama's meeting with the Dali Lama was
emblematic of Washington's efforts to foment internal unrest.
The gross political intervention of outgoing U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke
in domestic Chinese politics is an indication that diplomacy is not the
Obama regime's prime policy instrument when it comes to dealing with China.
Ambassador Locke openly met with Uighur and
Tibetan separatists and publicly disparaged China's economic success and
political system while openly encouraging opposition politics (FT, 2/28/14,
p. 2).
The Obama regime's attempt to advance empire in Asia via military
confrontation and trade pacts, which exclude China, has led China to
build-up its military capacity to avoid maritime strangulation. China
answers the US trade threat by advancing its productive capacity,
diversifying its trade relations, increasing its ties with Russia and
deepening its domestic market.
To date, the Obama regime's reckless militarization of the Pacific has not
led to an open break in relations with China, but the military road to
advancing empire at China's expense threatens a global economic catastrophe
or worse, a world war.
Imperial Advance -
Isolating, Encircling and Degrading Russia
With the advent of President Vladimir Putin and the reconstitution of
the Russian state and economy, the U.S. lost a vassal client and source of
plundered wealth.
Washington's empire-builders continued to seek
Russian 'cooperation and collaboration' in undermining independent states,
isolating China and pursuing its colonial wars.
The Russian state, under Putin and Medvedev, had
sought to accommodate U.S. empire builders via negotiated agreements, which
would enhance Russia's position in Europe, recognize Russian strategic
borders and acknowledge Russian security concerns.
However, Russian diplomacy secured few and
transitory gains while the US and EU made major gains with Russian
complicity and passivity.
The un-stated agenda of Washington, especially with Obama's drive to
re-launch a new wave of imperial conquests, was to undermine Russia's
re-emergence as a major player in world politics. The strategic idea was to
isolate Russia, weaken its growing international presence and return it to
the vassal status of the Yeltsin period, if possible.
From the US-EU takeover of Eastern Europe, the Balkans and Baltic states,
and their transformation into NATO military bases and capitalist vassal
states in the early 1990's, to the penetration and pillage of Russia during
the Yeltsin years, the prime purpose of Western policy has been to establish
a unipolar empire under US domination.
The EU and the US proceeded to dismember Yugoslavia into subservient
mini-states.
They then bombed Serbia in order to carve off
Kosovo, destroying one of the few independent countries still allied with
Russia. The U.S. then moved on to foment uprisings in Georgia, Ukraine and
Chechnya.
They
bombed, invaded and later occupied Iraq - a
former Russian ally in the Gulf region.
The driving strategy of US policy was to encircle and reduce Russia to the
status of a weak, marginal power, and to undermine Vladimir Putin's efforts
to restore Russia's position as a regional power.
In 2008 Washington's puppet regime in Georgia,
tested the mettle of the Russian state by launching an assault on South
Ossetia, killing at least 10 Russian peacekeepers and wounding hundreds (not
to mention thousands of civilians). Then-Russian President Medvedev
responded by sending the Russian armed forces to repel Georgian troops and
support the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
U.S. diplomatic agreements with Russia had been asymmetrical - Russia was to
acquiesce in Western expansion in exchange for 'political acceptance'.
Duplicity trumped open-diplomacy. Despite
agreements to the contrary, U.S. bases and missile installations were
established throughout Eastern Europe, pointing at Russia, under the pretext
that they were "really targeting Iran".
Even as Russia protested that post-Cold War
agreements were breached, the Empire ignored Moscow's complaints and
encirclement advanced.
In a further diplomatic disaster, Russia and China signed off on a
U.S.-authored United Nations Security Council agreement to allow NATO to
engage in "humanitarian overflights" in Libya.
NATO immediately took this as the 'green
light' for attack and converted 'humanitarian intervention' into a
devastating aerial bombing campaign that led to the overthrow of Libya's
legitimate government and the destruction of Libya as viable, independent
North African state.
By signing the 'humanitarian' UN agreement,
Russia and China lost a friendly government and trading partner in Africa!
Even earlier, the Russians had agreed to allow the US to transport weapons
and troops through Russian Federation territory to support the US invasion
of Afghanistan
with no reciprocal gain (except perhaps an even greater
flood of Afghan heroin).
Russian diplomats agreed to US (Zionist)-authored UN economic sanctions
against Iran's non-existent nuclear weapons program
undermining a political
ally and lucrative market.
Moscow believed that by backing US sanctions on
Iran and granting transport routes to Afghanistan in late 2001 they would
receive some 'security guarantees' from the Americans regarding the
separatist movements in the Caucuses.
The U.S. 'reciprocated' by further backing
Chechen separatist leaders exiled in the US despite the on-going terror
campaigns against Russian civilians - up to and even after the Chechen
slaughter of hundreds of school children and teachers in Beslan in 2004
With the US under Obama advancing its encirclement of Russia in Eurasia and
its isolation in North Africa and the Middle East, Putin finally decided to
draw a line by backing Russia's only remaining ally in the Middle East,
Syria.
Putin sought to secure a negotiated end to the
Western-Gulf Monarchist-backed mercenary invasion of Damascus. To little
avail: The US and EU increased arms shipments, military trainers and
financing to the 30,000 Islamist mercenaries based in Jordan as they engaged
in cross-border attacks to overthrow the Syrian government.
Washington and Brussels continued their imperial push toward the Russian
heartland by organizing and financing a violent seizure of power (putsch) in
western Ukraine.
The Obama regime financed a coalition of armed
neo-Nazi street fighters and neo-liberal politicos, to the tune of $5
billion dollars, to overthrow the elected regime. The putschists then moved
to end Crimean autonomy and break long-standing military treaty agreements
with Russia.
Under enormous pressure from the autonomous
Crimean government and the vast majority of the population and facing the
critical loss of its naval and military facilities on the Black Sea, Putin,
finally, forcefully moved Russian troops into a defensive mode in Crimea.
The Obama regime launched a series of aggressive moves against Russia to
isolate it and to buttress it faltering puppet regime in Kiev:
economic sanctions and expulsions were the
order of the day
Obama's seizure of the Ukraine signaled the start of a
'new Cold War'. The seizure of the Ukraine was part of Obama's grand
ongoing strategy of advancing empire.
The Ukraine power grab signaled the biggest
geo-political challenge to the continued existence of the Russian state.
Obama seeks to extend and deepen the imperial
sweep across Europe to the Caucuses: the violent regime coup and subsequent
defense of the puppet regime in Kiev are key elements in undermining a key
adversary - Russia.
After pretending to 'partner' with Russia, while slicing off Russian allies
in the Balkans and Mid-East over the previous decades, Obama made his most
audacious and reckless move. Casting off all pretexts of peaceful
co-existence and mutual accommodation, the Obama regime broke a
power-sharing agreement with Russia over Ukrainian governance and backed the
neo-Nazi putsch.
The Obama regime assumed that having secured Russia's earlier acquiescence
in the face of advancing US imperial power in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and
the Gulf region, Washington's empire-builders made the fateful decision to
test Russia in its most strategic geopolitical region, one directly
affecting the Russian people and its most strategic military assets.
Russia reacted in the only language understood
in Washington and Brussels: with a major military mobilization.
Obama's advance of 'empire-building via salami
tactics' and duplicitous diplomacy was nearing an end.
Advancing Empire in
the Middle East and Latin America
The imperial advance of the 1990's came to an end by the middle of the first
decade of the new millennium.
Defeats in Afghanistan, withdrawal from Iraq,
the demise of puppet regimes in Egypt and Tunisia, election losses in the
Ukraine and the defeat and demise of pro-U.S. neo-liberal regimes in Latin
America were exacerbated by a deepening economic crisis in the imperial
centers of Europe and Wall Street.
Obama had few economic and political options to advance the empire.
Yet his regime was determined to end the retreat
and advance the empire; he resorted to tactics and strategies more akin to
19th century colonial and 20th century totalitarian regimes.
The methods were violent- militarism was the policy pivot. But at a time of
domestic imperial exhaustion, new military tactics replaced large-scale
ground force invasions. Proxy-armed mercenaries took center stage in
overthrowing regimes targeted by the US. Political and ideological
affinities were subsumed under the generic euphemism of "rebels".
The mass media alternated between pressuring for
greater military escalation and endorsing the existing level of imperial
warfare.
The entire political spectrum in Europe and the
US shifted rightward - even as the majority of the electorate rejected new
military engagements, especially ground wars.
Obama escalated troops in Afghanistan, launched an air war that overthrew
President Kaddafi and turned the Libya into a broken, failed state.
Proxy wars became the new strategy to advance imperial empire-building.
Syria was targeted - tens of thousands of
Islamist extremists were recruited and funded by imperial regimes and
despotic Gulf monarchies. Millions of refugees fled, tens of thousands were
killed
In Latin America, Obama backed the military coup in Honduras
overthrowing the elected Liberal government of President Manuel Zelaya,
he recognized a congressional coup ousting the elected center-left
government in Paraguay while refusing to recognize the election victory of
President Maduro in Venezuela.
In the face of Maduro's win in Venezuela,
Washington backed several months of mob street violence in an attempt to
destabilize the country.
In the Ukraine, Egypt, Venezuela and Thailand, 'the street' replaced
elections.
Obama's strategic imperial goals have focused on
the re-conquest and pillage of Russia and its return to the vassal status of
the Boris Yeltsin years, Latin America's return to the neo-liberal regimes
of 1990's and China to the submissiveness of the 1980's.
The imperial strategy has been 'to conquer from
within' setting the stage for domination from the outside.
Advancing Empire -
Israel and the Middle East Detour
One of the great historical paradoxes of the U.S. imperial retreat of the 21st
century has been the role played by influence of
Israel and its Zionist Fifth Column embedded within the U.S.
political power structure.
Washington's wars and sanctions in the Middle
East have been largely at the behest of influential 'Israel Firsters' in the
White House, Pentagon, Treasury and National Security Council and Congress.
It was largely because the US was engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
that Washington "neglected" China's growing economic prowess.
By concentrating on 'wars for Israel'
in
the Middle East, the U.S. has not been in a position to challenge
the rise of nationalism and populism in Latin America. Protracted 'wars for
Israel' have exhausted the US economy and the American public's enthusiasm
for new ground wars elsewhere.
Zionist ideologues, dubbed "neo-conservatives", were instrumental in shaping
the global militarist approach to empire-building and marginalizing the
market-driven empire building, favored by the multi-nationals and giant
extractive industry.
Obama's attempt to halt the retreat of empire caused by Zionist militarism
has not borne fruit: His effort to co-opt Zionists and pressure Israel to
stop fomenting new wars in the Middle East is a failure.
His 'pivot to Asia' has turned into a strategy
of brute military encirclement of China. His overtures to Iran have been
stymied by the Zionist power bloc in Congress and the imposition of
Israeli-dictated terms of negotiations. The entire "advance of the
empire-building project", which was to define the Obama legacy, has been
weakened by the enormous cost of heeding the advice and directives of the
Israel-loyalists within his Administration.
Israel, one of the most brutal colonial powers,
has paradoxically and unintentionally played a major role in undermining
Obama's efforts to reverse the decline of empire and advance the U.S.
diplomatic and economic dimensions of empire-building
Results and
Perspectives - Advancing Empire in the Post Neo-Liberal Period
Obama's reckless effort to advance empire in the second decade of the 21st
century is far more dangerous than his predecessors in the late 20th
century. Russia has recovered.
It is not the disintegrating state that
Bush and
Clinton dismembered and pillaged.
China is no longer a rising market economy so
eager to trade with the US while overlooking American incursions into
Chinese territorial waters. Today China is a major economic power, wielding
economic leverage in the form of $3 Trillion in U.S. Treasury notes. China
no longer tolerates U.S. interference in its domestic politics - it is
willing to crack down on U.S.-backed ethnic separatists and terrorists.
Latin America, including Venezuela, have developed autonomous regional
organizations, diversified their markets to Asia and established a powerful
post-neoliberal consensus.
Venezuela has turned its military, once the
favorite instrument of US-engineered coups, into a bulwark of the existing
democratic order.
The electoral road to US empire-building has been closed or requires tight
imperial "supervision" to secure "favorable outcomes". Washington's new
policy of choice is violence:
enlisting mob action, mercenary extremists,
Islamists and Uighur terrorists, neo-Nazis and the riff raff of the
world in its service.
The balance sheet of six years of "advancing
empire" under Obama is in doubt.
The violent
overthrow of President Kaddafi did not lead
to a stable client regime: the utter destruction and chaos in Libya has
undercut the imperial presence. Syria is under attack but by anti-Western
Islamist fanatics.
The defeat of Assad will not 'advance empire' as
much as it will expand radical Islamist (including Al Qaeda) power.
The Ukraine puppet regime of neo-liberals and neo-Nazis is literally
bankrupt, riven with internal conflicts and facing profound regional
divisions. Russia is threatened, but their leaders have taken decisive
military action to defend their Crimean allies and strategic military bases.
Obama has provoked and threatened adversaries but has not secured much in
terms of valuable allies or clients.
His effort to replicate the imperial advances
of the 1990's has failed because the relationships of power
between Europe and Russia, Japan and China, and Venezuela and Colombia have
changed.
Proxies, predator drones and the US Special
Forces are not able to reverse the retreat. The economic crisis has cut too
deep; the domestic exhaustion with empire is too pervasive. The cost of
sustaining Israel is too high.
Advancing empire in these circumstances is a
dangerous game: it risks a larger nuclear war to overcome adversity and
retreat.
