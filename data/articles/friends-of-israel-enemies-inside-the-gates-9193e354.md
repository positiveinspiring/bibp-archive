It cannot be said, too often or too loudly: The interests of a Nation's own
Citizens must come first.
The
9/11
Cover-Up is falling apart at the seams,
and politicians should be made accountable, either for their ignorance about
issues that affect their nation, or because they have been protecting the
official story, knowing that is is false.
Summary:
Recently, political pressure has been brought to bear against a
trades unionist for attempting to express his views about the events of
9/11, on Australia's publicly funded broadcaster, the ABC. This video
redresses the balance, and makes it clear that Australia's prime minister is
either ignorant, beyond belief, or she is putting the interests of nuclear,
Apartheid Israel ahead of Australia's.
