A BBC Documentary about the hubris at the heart of The Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS) during the boom. And the ensuing demise under Sir
Fred Goodwin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland was once a famous
Scottish institution; a bank with a reputation for prudence. But in October
2008, less than a decade after Fred Goodwin took over as chief executive, it
came within hours of collapsing.
RBS later posted the biggest loss in UK corporate history - 24 billion
pounds - which damaged the banks reputation for financial prudence and
Scotlands image as a global financial center.
Using previously unbroadcast footage of the banks top executives and
interviews with bank insiders, this documentary tells the compelling story
of a national catastrophe.
