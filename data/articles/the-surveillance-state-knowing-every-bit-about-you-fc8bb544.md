No one ever accused Jeremy Bentham of thinking small.
The early 18th-century British
philosopher, social reformer, and co-founder of the celebrated philosophical
school of Utilitarianism, Bentham was known for his unconventional ideas.
Like many self-styled progressive thinkers of
his age, Bentham expended a considerable amount of energy dreaming up new
ways to use the power of the state to protect private citizens from their
own alleged follies.
The concept of the Panopticon was probably Benthams best-known brainchild.
An extravagant idea for its time, it has proven an enduring metaphor in our
time and - far more importantly - prefigured our modern obsession with
high-tech surveillance.
Derived from Greek roots that mean all-seeing,
Benthams Panopticon was a building designed to house many people in
close quarters whose rooms were so configured that a central authority,
using a system of tubes and mirrors, could keep every inmate under constant
surveillance.
The
Panopticon concept could be applied to
prisons, factories, or any place where large numbers of people would live or
work in close quarters.
Morals reformed - health preserved -
industry invigorated - instruction diffused - public burthens [burdens]
lightened - economy seated, as it were, upon a rock - the Gordian knot
of the poor-law not cut, but untied - all by a simple idea in
architecture, Bentham enthused, proclaiming that his Panopticon
represented a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a
quantity hitherto without example.
The energetic Bentham tried to persuade the
British government to let him design a Panopticon prison, but was ultimately
unsuccessful.
Although he managed to persuade Prime Minister
William Pitt the Younger of the Panopticons potential, Pitts successor
shut down the project.
But Benthams premise - of a system of comprehensive state surveillance to
guarantee a pliant and docile citizenry - is still with us, magnified by the
potency of 21st-century technology and zealously promoted the
world over, but especially in Western nations, like Great Britain and the
United States, that once viewed such state activities as abhorrent and
dangerous to liberty.
A decade after the defining crisis of our era,
the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the United States of America is on the verge
of becoming a Panopticon society, with powers of state surveillance far
beyond the most fevered imaginings of Bentham and fellow pre-modern
utopians.
Panopticon Society
In the sagebrush desert of Bluffdale, Utah, in the shadow of the Wasatch
Mountains, a vast new federal surveillance and intelligence processing
center is being erected.
The so-called
Utah Data Center, operated by
the
National Security Agency, will occupy more than a million square
feet when it becomes operational sometime next year. Within its ultra-secure
perimeter, surveillance on a scale never before achieved will be carried
out, of a vast array of digital communications - cellphone conversations,
e-mails, Google searches, and the like - both on foreign and domestic soil.
Thanks to significant (and highly classified)
advances in decryption technology, coupled with unprecedented supercomputing
power, the new facility will be the nerve center for near-total surveillance
capabilities over hundreds of millions of Americans. If the Utah Data Center
fulfills it ominous potential, the cherished American right to privacy will
have no more substance.
But the Bluffdale facility is merely the culmination of an aggressive new
effort to bring all of Americans private activities under at least
potential surveillance by the feds, an effort undertaken soon after the 9/11
attacks.
The first attempt to create what New York Times
columnist William Safire called computer dossiers on 300 million Americans
was launched in 2002.
Under the leadership of John Poindexter, former
National Security Advisor under Ronald Reagan, the Information Awareness
Office (IAO) was created within the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA).
Its goal, well-publicized at the time, was
total information awareness, the warrantless compilation of vast databases
on the private financial activities and communications of every single
American - their credit card activity, e-mails, social networks, phone
calls, airline ticket purchases, car rentals, and so forth.
This data would then be analyzed to look for
suspicious patterns of behavior, evidence of potential terrorist activity.
From the outset, DARPA and the IAO generated a lot of bad publicity, driven
in no small measure by the formers genuinely spooky choice of logo:
the all-seeing eye atop a pyramid (also
depicted on the back of the dollar bill) gazing godlike at the entire
world, accompanied by the motto Cientia est Potentia (Knowledge is
Power).
By 2003, the public and congressional hue and
cry over what was transparently an extra-constitutional program had become
so great that Congress officially defunded the IAO.
But like the stereotyped villain in a slasher film that cannot be killed,
much of the work carried out by the IAO was merely transferred to other
branches of Americas vast security establishment.
While Congress tried to stipulate that none of
the new tools being developed could be used against American citizens or on
American soil, the drive to develop more powerful supercomputers with the
ability to compile more and more comprehensive data profiles of anybody,
anywhere, continued throughout the last decade.
And it is by no means clear whether the federal
government did, in fact, refrain from spying on its own citizens during that
period; if the testimony of certain disgruntled former NSA employees is to
believed, quite the opposite is true.
According to William Binney, a former
senior cryptographer and mathematician at the NSA, the storied and
notoriously closemouthed security agency has systematically flouted and
circumvented all congressional limits on intelligence gathering ever since
9/11, ignoring in some cases restrictions on spying on Americans that date
from the post-Watergate era.
Speaking of the launching of warrantless
wiretapping soon after
9/11, Binney, who resigned in disgust after four
decades of code breaking, did not mince words.
They violated the Constitution setting it
up, he told Wired magazines James Bamford.
But they didnt care. They were going to do
it anyway, and they were going to crucify anyone who stood in the way.
When they started violating the Constitution, I couldnt stay.

According to Binney, the program, codenamed
Stellar Wind, intercepted
without warrant not only domestic phone calls but domestic e-mails as well. At the very beginning, the NSA was intercepting
320 million domestic phone calls per day - and the number quickly expanded.
Bamford relates:
According to Binney - who has maintained
close contact with agency employees until a few years ago - the taps in
the secret rooms dotting the country are actually powered by highly
sophisticated software programs that conduct deep packet inspection,
examining Internet traffic as it passes through the
10-gigabit-per-second cables at the speed of light.
The software, created by a
company called Narus that is now part of
Boeing, is controlled remotely from NSA headquarters at Fort Meade in
Maryland and searches US sources for target addresses, locations,
countries, and phone numbers, as well as watch-listed names, keywords,
and phrases in email.
Any communication that arouses suspicion,
especially those to or from the million or so people on agency watch
lists, are automatically copied or recorded and then transmitted to the
NSA.
The scope of surveillance expands from there, Binney says.
Once a name
is entered into the Narus database, all phone calls and other
communications to and from that person are automatically routed to the
NSAs recorders.
Anybody you want, route to a recorder,
Binney says. If your numbers in there? Routed and gets recorded.
He adds,
The Narus device allows you to take it all.
And when the Bluffdale facility is
completed, whatever is collected will be routed there for storage and
analysis.
According to Binney, one of the deepest secrets of the Stellar Wind
program - again, never confirmed until now - was that the NSA gained
warrantless access to AT&Ts vast trove of domestic and international
billing records, detailed information about who called whom in the US
and around the world. As of 2007, AT&T had more than 2.8 trillion
records housed in a database at its Florham Park, New Jersey, complex.
Verizon was also part of the program, Binney says, and that greatly
expanded the volume of calls subject to the agencys domestic
eavesdropping.
That multiplies the call rate by at
least a factor of five, he says.
So youre over a billion and a
half calls a day. (Spokespeople for Verizon and AT&T said their
companies would not comment on matters of national security.)
The NSA also has the ability to eavesdrop on
telephone conversations in real time, whenever it deems appropriate. In the
months and years following 9/11, any excuse would do, especially for family
members abroad calling home to the United States.
Adrienne J. Kinne, who worked as a voice
interceptor for the NSA both before and after the 9/11 attacks, told Wired,
Basically all rules were thrown out the
window, and they would use any excuse to justify a waiver to spy on
Americans.
Journalists working overseas were routinely
eavesdropped upon whenever they called their families stateside.
A lot of time you could tell they were
calling their families, Kinne admitted, incredibly intimate, personal
conversations.
Kinne likened the practice to finding someones
personal diary and going through it.
But the NSAs suffocating blanket of surveillance has one major hole - the
ability of modern encryption protocols like the Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES) to resist decryption, even by the most powerful supercomputers
available. The solution? Build still more powerful supercomputers, machines
capable of carrying out one quadrillion (1015) operations per second, a
capability known in industry jargon as a petaflop.
Accordingly, what has been characterized as
nothing less than a modern-day Manhattan Project, the High Productivity
Computing Systems program, was begun in 2004 to develop computers with just
such a capacity.
That the research and development for the
project was and is being carried out at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
Tennessee - the same place where uranium was enriched for the first atomic
bombs - is perhaps an unintended irony. But this time around, Americas best
and brightest are devising a superweapon not for deployment against a
distant foreign military power, but against our own citizens, to finally
ensure that any degree of privacy whatsoever can be breached by Washingtons
all-seeing eye.
By all accounts, the High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) program has been a
stunning success.
An unclassified program at Oak Ridge produced
the so-called Jaguar, an upgraded
Cray XT5 supercomputer that clocked in
as the worlds fastest in 2009 - at a rate of 1.75 petaflops. A top-secret
program, also at Oak Ridge, has reputedly created machines faster still,
whose exact capabilities remain a closely guarded secret.
And the NSA is already setting its sights on new orders of computing power
magnitude - the exaflop (one quintillion, or 1018 operations a second) being
its goal for 2018, and other, more exotic levels beyond that (the zettaflop/1021
operations per second and the yottaflop/1024).
When such mind-boggling computing power becomes
available, as it eventually must (consider that the worlds official fastest
computer as of this writing is a Japanese supercomputer operating at more
than 10 petaflops), current encryption protocols like the AES will become
obsolete.
If the NSA manages to develop such a capability
in secret, as it clearly aims to do, private-sector encryption will be none
the wiser, leaving essentially all encrypted communications as bare to
government code-breakers as the Germans best codes in World War II
eventually were to the Allies.
For it is nothing less than a terminal war on Americans privacy that is
being waged, in deep secrecy and by a comparatively small and fanatically
dedicated group of government security fetishists.
And the supercomputers that are to dismantle the
final barricades protecting communications privacy will be no less a power
trump card in the hands of the state than nuclear weapons have proven to be
for the worlds elite military powers.
Overlooking From
Overhead
The governments new powers of surveillance will not be limited to
supercomputers tracking our every act of private electronic computation.
The advent of unmanned drones, a legacy of the
war in Afghanistan, will soon transform law enforcement at every level. For
the cost of one police helicopter that can only be in one place at a time, a
given jurisdiction could deploy dozens of remotely piloted drones to overfly
restive neighborhoods and keep tabs on backyards and open windows as well as
public areas.
This is not idle speculation. In February, Congress passed the FAA
Reauthorization Act, which is transparently calculated to streamline the
introduction of unmanned drones, for federal, state, and local law
enforcement and surveillance, into U.S. domestic airspace.
U.S. Customs and
Border Protection already operate nine Predator-type drones, chiefly for
border surveillance, under four long-term FAA certificates.
But the new legislation in effect orders the FAA
to develop an expedited protocol, by years end, for authorizing the use of
unmanned drones by law enforcement at every level, as well as any other
government agency (read: Homeland Security, one agency that has made no
secret of its desire to operate a fleet of drones in domestic airspace) that
wants to use them.
The legislation has appalled privacy advocates.
By one estimate, once the FAA floodgates are
opened, American skies may be populated with as many as 30,000 drones by the
end of this decade, all busily keeping tabs on any activity not carried out
in basements or behind closed doors and covered windows.
Then there is the ongoing drive to desensitize Americans to having to stand
naked before the state, as is now required for those who wish to board an
airplane within the United States.
Backscatter imaging machines, which digitally
strip-search passengers as they pass through security, have proliferated
rapidly and will soon be found in every commercial airport in the land, if
the TSA has any say in the matter. These machines produce finely detailed
images of naked bodies, images with high enough resolution to display
colostomy bags, breast prostheses, and every intimate detail of the human
body.
Those who object may opt out of being digitally
strip-searched - and must instead submit to intrusive pat-downs in which TSA
agents will touch the most intimate parts of the body.
Not Nice Nakedness
These machines are now being introduced in train stations and courthouses as
well, as naked becomes the new normal.
A recent Supreme Court decision upholding the
right of police to strip-search anyone arrested for any reason (the
plaintiff, Albert Florence, was strip-searched twice after being arrested
for an unpaid traffic fine) gives legal countenance to the dangerous notion
that state-sanctioned strip-searches of anyone, anywhere, anytime are
perfectly acceptable in the post 9/11 world.
But as Naomi Wolf of the Guardian has recently pointed out, allowing the
state to strip us (literally) of one of the last vestiges of privacy - our
clothing - is both symbolically and practically one of the most potent
symptoms of a police state:
Believe me:
you dont want the state having the power to strip your clothes
off.
History shows that the use of forced nudity by a state that is
descending into fascism is powerfully effective in controlling and subduing
populations.
The political use of forced nudity by anti-democratic regimes is long
established. Forcing people to undress is the first step in
breaking down their sense of individuality and dignity and reinforcing their
powerlessness.
Enslaved women were sold naked on the blocks in the American
south, and adolescent male slaves served young white ladies at table in the
south, while they themselves were naked: their invisible humiliation was a
trope for their emasculation. Jewish prisoners herded into concentration
camps were stripped of clothing and photographed naked, as iconic images of
that Holocaust reiterated.
One of the most terrifying moments for me when I visited Guantanamo prison
in 2009 was seeing the way the architecture of the building positioned
glass-fronted shower cubicles facing intentionally right into the central
atrium - where young female guards stood watch over the forced nakedness of
Muslim prisoners, who had no way to conceal themselves.
Laws and rulings such as [the recent Supreme
Court ruling upholding strip searches of anyone arrested] are clearly
designed to bring the conditions of Guantanamo, and abusive detention, home.
The spanking-new total surveillance state requires legal camouflage, given
that so much of its newfound powers of surveillance (in effect, the search
part of search and seizure with which the authors of the Bill of Rights
were so concerned) is carried out without the warrants and probable cause
required by the Fourth Amendment.
Adherence to the letter of this amendment -
which stipulates that the,
right of the people to be secure in their
persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated,
...would appear to preclude warrantless
surveillance by drones and supercomputer algorithms, as well as digital and
literal strip-searches without probable cause by airport authorities and law
enforcement generally.
Where Is the
Constitution?
But the Fourth Amendment has proven no impediment to the homeland security
fetishists, from the President on down, thanks to a Congress congenitally
unwilling to challenge the relentless advance of Big Security.
It was Congress, after all, that produced the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (NDAA), which
President Obama coyly signed on the last day of 2011, when the nation was
preoccupied with holiday celebrations.
This act gave legal cover to the actions of the
U.S. government since 9/11 in detaining indefinitely and without trial
persons alleged to have committed hostile acts against the United States.
The NDAA not only explicitly authorizes such detentions (in section 1021)
but also (section 1022) requires that detainees under this provision be held
in military custody, either within the United States or on foreign soil.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, in what must surely be regarded as one of its
most pernicious rulings since Roe v. Wade, has inexplicably upheld the right
of law-enforcement authorities, whether local, state, or national, to
strip-search anyone arrested for any reason, in Florence v. Board of Chosen
Freeholders of County of Burlington.
The specious grounds for this ruling are the
possibility that someone arrested could have a weapon or contraband
concealed somewhere on or inside his body, thereby posing a threat to
authorities and other inmates.
Correctional officials have a significant
interest in conducting a thorough search as a standard part of the
intake process, wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy on behalf of the majority
that included all of the Supreme Courts supposed right-wing and
conservative justices.
For once, the liberal minority got it right.
I cannot find justification for the
strip-search policy at issue here - a policy that would subject those
arrested for minor offenses to serious invasions of their personal
privacy, wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
She might well have added that people - even
criminals - generally do not walk around with weapons and narcotics
concealed inside their bodies, in anticipation of possible arrest and
imprisonment.
It is patently absurd to justify strip searches
of traffic violators as though they were hardened criminals trying to
smuggle contraband to others on the inside. Yet that is precisely the kind
of non-logic that undergirds the Supreme Courts latest usurpation.
The total loss of privacy coupled with aggressively expanding powers of the
state to encroach on our personal freedoms with impunity - these are the two
prongs of the police-state pincers that are closing swiftly on American
liberties.
The long-feared garrison state is coming into
being on American soil before our very eyes, with the approval, tacit or
overt, of millions of Americans who believe that the only way to guarantee
national security is to deprive us of personal security (the Fourth
Amendment, after all, protects the right of the people to be secure
against government encroachment on a personal level).
In a coming day, unless the tide of Big
Government is stemmed, we will all find ourselves living in a hi-tech
Panopticon stretching from sea to shining sea.
Somewhere, Benthams shade is smiling.
