Police Commissioner Helric Fredou, Number Two Police Officer of the Regional Service of France's Judicial Police (JP), Limoges, (Haute-Vienne),
"committed suicide on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the police station."
Commissioner Helric Fredou was part of the police investigation into the Charlie Hebdo terror attack.
Terror suspects Cherif and Said Kouachi who were shot dead by police on January 9, spent their high-school years in the Limoges region.
No doubt this was the object of Fredou's police investigation. Yet police and media reports state that on that same Wednesday he was involved in a meeting with the family of one of the Charlie Hebdo victims.
On Wednesday, as part of the Charlie Hebdo investigation, he dispatched a team of police officials under his jurisdiction. He is reported to have waited for the return of his team for a debriefing.
Immediately following the police debriefing, he was involved in preparing his police report.
Helric Fredou
According to media reports, he committed suicide at around 1am on Thursday, within hours of the police debriefing.
He used his own police weapon, a SIG-Sauer to "shoot himself in the head".
At the time of his death, police claim to have not known the reason for his alleged suicide. This was reflected in their official statements to the media: "It is unknown at this time the reasons for his actions". However, a back story appears to have been inserted simultaneously, most likely from the very same police media liaisons, who then told the press that Fredou was 'depressed and overworked'. For any law enforcement officer in France, it would seem rather odd that anyone would want to miss the biggest single terror event of the century, or history in the making, as it were. 21st Century Wire

An autopsy was performed at the University Hospital of Limoges, "confirming the suicide".
There has been a total news blackout.
The French media decided or was instructed not to cover the incident. Not news worthy? So much for "Je suis Charlie" and "Freedom of Expression" in journalism.
Likewise, the Western media including all major news services (AP, AFP, Reuters, Deutsche Welle, etc) have not covered the issue.
One isolated report in Le Parisien presents the act of suicide as being totally unrelated to the Charlie Hebdo investigation. While described as being depressive and suffering from a burnout, police reports state that Helric Fredou's suicide was totally unexpected.
Moreover, it is worth noting that, according to reports, he committed suicide in his workplace, in his office at the police station.
Did he commit suicide? Was he incited to commit suicide? Or was he an "honest Cop" executed on orders of France's judicial police? Has his report been released?
Did he commit suicide?
Was he incited to commit suicide?
Or was he an "honest Cop" executed on orders of France's judicial police?
Has his report been released?
These are issues for France's journalists to address. It's called investigative reporting.
Or is it outright media censorship...?
