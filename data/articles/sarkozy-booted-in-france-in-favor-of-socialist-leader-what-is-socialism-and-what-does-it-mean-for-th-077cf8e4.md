Socialism is one of those words that get tossed around frivolously. In the
United States, it is usually associated with a negative connotation.
The European nation of France has voted for
socialism for the first time in decades by electing Francois Hollande
to replace their president Nicolas Sarkozy. We know that in times
like these, a lot of people that are used to hearing this term thrown around
carelessly will be taking notice and wanting to know a little more about
what it means.
And this move by the French people makes the
time ripe to talk about socialism and the coming New World Order.
The idea of socialism is not new and is pretty simple when you get right
down to it. In a socialist system, the government regulates nearly
everything, but with the best of intentions, of course.
The idea is to stop a distinction between
classes and make the nation (or the world, as well address later) all part
of one big class, working together for the common good. The goal of the
socialist agenda is to not let capitalists create goods and services based
on profitability, but to meet all of the needs of the people. Competition
wouldnt really exist in this environment because there would be no point in
it.
After all, everyone would have access to the
same thing, which means, exactly what you need.
The best example of the difference between socialism versus the current
system in America is the way the working class and upper class relate to
each other. Basically, you have a rich upper class pushing the lower classes
to produce more for less so they can enjoy greater profits. Competition is
paramount, and companies do battle to capitalize on the market as best they
can. It is extremely difficult for one class to penetrate into another.
The rich tend to get richer and pass this along
their family lines, while the working class tend to stay where they are.
Karl Marx came up with the idea of socialism to end this distinction,
and at a moments glance, it is easy to see why the idea is attractive to
some.
Obviously, if you are part of the rich upper
class, the last thing you want to do is help distribute your wealth to
everyone else, but for the working class, and definitely the
poverty-stricken poor classes, it seems like a great idea. The people in
France are echoing the sentiments of the rest of Europe. After a series
economic crises, the region has overwhelmingly voted for change, change, and
more change.
Will socialism help France?
That remains to be seen, but it will help one
thing
the New World Order agenda. A comic illustration of the ideas
behind socialism.
You can see it in America already. Now, we are not outright accusing
President
Barack Obama of socialism, although
many out there have done so. We think he is just one cog in a wheel that has
been turning for decades and will turn for decades more.
His claim to fame is to regulate health care.
Obamacare as it has been dubbed is essentially socialist in its concept.
The government will take control of health care and make sure that everyone
has equal access to it.
Once again, sounds good on the surface. And, who
knows? It may work great and we will all be better off for it.
But it is just one step, one domino that will
lead to others that are already in the pipelines. Slowly but surely, the
goal of the powers that be, is to control literally everything. Down to the
minutest detail.
Why? For the good of all mankind of course.
You see, at the heart of institutions like
Bilderberg,
the Illuminati, and
the
New World Order, is a desire to take the world and unify it,
spreading the resources for everyone, and not just the capitalists.
It could be said that the New World Order is
indeed socialist, at the end of the day. But there is one glaring
problem with their agenda and the socialist agenda. The idea of socialism is
to eliminate class distinction, and yet, the New World Order seeks to create
a super-elite class that will govern everyone else, who should be equal
according to their principles.
This super-elite class really
already exists, and they are the movers and shakers behind the
globalist agenda.
France is just another domino as well. The world tolerance for socialism is
ever-increasing, just as the super-elite hope for. They dont want to force
the New World Order down your throat; they want you to open your mouth,
stick your tongue out, and take it like medicine.
That is the ultimate goal
not just to institute
a new order of things, but to convince the people they are better off for
it.
That is the question for every single one of
us...
