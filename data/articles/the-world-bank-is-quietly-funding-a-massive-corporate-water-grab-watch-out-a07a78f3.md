Billions have been spent allowing corporations to profit from public water
sources even though water privatization has been an epic failure in Latin
America, Southeast Asia, North America, Africa and everywhere else it's been
tried.
But don't tell that to controversial loan-sharks at
the World Bank.
Last month, its private-sector funding arm International Finance Corporation
(IFC) quietly dropped a cool 100 million euros ($139 million US) on Veolia
Voda, the Eastern European subsidiary of Veolia, the world's largest private
water corporation.
Its latest target? Privatization of Eastern Europe's
water resources.
"Veolia has made it clear that their business model is based on maximizing
profits, not long-term investment," Joby Gelbspan, senior program
coordinator for private-sector watchdog Corporate Accountability
International, told AlterNet.
"Both the World Bank and the transnational
water companies like Veolia have clearly acknowledged they don't want to
invest in the infrastructure necessary to improve water access in Eastern
Europe. That's why this 100 million Euro investment in
Veolia Voda by the
World Bank's private investment arm over the summer is so alarming. It's
further evidence that the World Bank remains committed to water
privatization, despite all evidence that this approach will not solve the
world's water crisis."
All the evidence Veolia needs that water grabs are doomed exercises can be
found in its birthplace of France, more popularly known as the heartland of
water privatization.
In June, the municipal administration of Paris
reclaimed the City of Light's water services from both of its homegrown
multinationals Veolia and Suez, after a torrent of controversy.
That's just
one of 40 re-municipilazations in France alone, which can be added to those
in,
-
Africa
-
Asia
-
Latin America
-
North America,
...and more in hopes of painting
a not-so-pretty picture: Water privatization is ultimately both a horrific
concept and a failed project.
"It's outrageous that the World Bank's IFC would continue to invest in
corporate water privatizations when they are failing all over the world,"
Maude Barlow, chairwoman of Food and Water Watch and the author of
Blue
Covenant - The Global Water Crisis and the Fight for the Right to Water, told
AlterNet.
"A similar IFC investment in the Philippines is an unmitigated
disaster. Local communities and their governments around the world are
canceling their contracts with companies like Veolia because of cost
overruns, worker layoffs and substandard service."
The Philippines is an excellent example of water privatization's broken
model.
After passing the Water Crisis Act in 1995, the Philippines landed a
$283 million privatization plan managed partially by multinational giants
like Suez and Bechtel. After some success, everything fell apart after 2000,
and it wasn't long before tariff prices repeatedly increased, water service
and quality worsened, and public opposition skyrocketed.
Today, some
Filipinos still don't have water connections, tariffs have increased from
300 to 700 percent in some regions, and outbreaks of cholera and
gastroenteritis have cost lives and sickened hundreds.
"The World Bank has learned nothing from these disasters and continues to be
blinded by an outdated ideology that only the unregulated market will solve
the world's problems," added Barlow.
But asking the World Bank to learn from disaster
would be akin to
annihilating its overall mission, which is to capitalize on disaster in the
developing world in pursuit of profit.
Its nasty history of economic and
environmental shock therapy sessions have severely wounded more than one
country, and has been sharply criticized by brainiacs like Joseph Stiglitz,
who was once the Bank's chief economist, and Naomi Klein, whose
indispensable history
The Shock Doctrine is a horrorshow of privatization
nightmares.
From its cultural imperialism and insensitivity to regional
differences to its domination by a handful of economic elites drunk on
deregulation, whose utter failure needs no further example than our
continuing global economic crisis, the World Bank's good intentions have
been compromised by an unending string of terrible press and crappier deals.
"In the past, the World Bank pushed privatization as the way to increase
investment in basic infrastructure for water systems," said Gelbspan.
"But
since then bank officials have admitted that the transnational corporations
don't want to invest in infrastructure, and instead want only to pare down
operations and skim profits. The World Bank has lowered the bar, satisfied
with so-called 'operational efficiency,' that cuts utility workforce,
tightens up bill collections and shuts off people who can't pay."
That's been a recipe for failure and protest, especially in the very region
that IFC and Veolia hope to pump for all its water worth.
In 1998, World
Bank loans were secured to upgrade the crumbling post-Soviet water system in
Yerevan, a city in the Eastern European nation of Armenia. With a caveat: It
had to be managed by a private contractor.
The
Italian transnational ACEA
landed the job, but quickly failed to extend water access, partially thanks
to company corruption.
It also failed to properly maintain water pressure,
allowing sewage to seep into the city's drinking water and sicken hundreds.
Despite the travesty, the World Bank issued another contract in 2006 to
Veolia, which hired ACEA's top executive. Two years later, only one in three
Yerevan residents were lucky enough to score 24-hour water service, while
contamination problems continued. Veolia's contract with the city is up for
renewal in 2015.
The same goes for the Turkish city of Alacati, which landed a $13 million
loan in the late '90s, as well as Veolia's incompetence.
The city's water
bills skyrocketed to 12 times the price of service in other parts of the
country. Multiply that times most every nation or city that has privatized
its water service, and you've got a good idea of why the World Bank's IFC is
under fire for rapacious resource-snatching.
And why the developing world is
right to be wary of its good graces, although the World Bank can do good
when it so chooses.
"The World Bank does not at all speak with one voice on their
pro-privatization stance," Darcey O'Callaghan,
Food and Water Watch's
international policy director, explained to AlterNet.
"One staff member
referred to it as a bad experiment that has been proven wrong, while higher
staffers try to take a more nuanced position, claiming that the Bank is
neither for or against privatization but simply promotes the most
appropriate model for specific communities. Unfortunately, our own
statistics have shown that regardless of their statements, 52 percent of
their projects between 2004 and 2008 promoted some form of privatization."
But rather than repair privatization's failed project at its source, the
World Bank is simply spinning off its compromised philosophy to the IFC.
So
while the World Bank may be torn in its endorsement of water privatization,
the IFC has no such reservations, in hopes of dodging the slings and arrows
of public outcry, and perhaps legal liability.
"What's really scary," O'Callaghan added, "is that we are increasingly
seeing the International Finance Corporation pick up where the Bank has left
off in water privatization. The IFC is a Bank-sponsored institution whose
goal is to promote the private sector, and because their financing also
comes from the private sector, they can be more difficult to hold
accountable.
Worse yet, according to our 2000-2008 stats, 80 percent of IFC
loans had gone to the four largest multinational water companies, further
concentrating the global water industry."
It's not just water that's at the center of Earth's mounting resource wars.
In late October, Britain's government announced it was looking to sell off
its state-owned forests to counteract a yawning deficit. Today, natural gas
companies are preparing to drill in America's national parks. Indeed,
America and Britain's bungled occupation of Iraq is a protracted resource
war for control of the embattled nation's oil reserves.
Water is just one
more natural resource, albeit the most important one, worth a killing to
those seeking to callously leverage limited funds for innocent lives.
"Droughts and deserts are spreading in over 100 countries," Barlow said. "It
is now clear that our world is running out of clean water, as the demand
gallops ahead of supply. These water corporations, backed still by the World
Bank, seek to take advantage of this crisis by taking more control over
dwindling water supplies."
Which is another way of saying that, regardless of the refreshing trend
toward re-municipalization, no one should expect the World Bank or its IFC
untouchables to give up the privatization and deregulation ghost anytime
soon.
That means that every city, and citizen, is due for a day of reckoning
of some sort, and should fight back against the bankrupt privatization
paradigm with everything in its arsenal.
"Get involved at the local level," O'Callaghan said. "Know where your water
comes from. Fight against privatization schemes. Promote conservation. Don't
drink bottled water."
And Barlow adds,
"The only path to a water-secure future is water
conservation, source water protection, watershed restoration and the just
and equitable sharing of the water resources of the planet.
Water is a
commons, a public trust and a human right and no one has the right to
appropriate for profit when others are dying from lack of access."
