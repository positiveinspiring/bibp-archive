These four groups of angels are a band of servers, pledged to the service of the Christ, and their work is to contact men and to teach them along certain lines.
Through the increasing sensitivity of men and through the steady thinning of the separating veil, more and more during the coming years will the telepathic faculties of men and their power to respond to inner inspiration be developed and demonstrated. By the growth of intuitional telepathy and the increasing comprehension of the power of color and sound will the work of the Christ and of the Great Ones be contacted and understood, and the peoples released from the thralldom of the past and enabled to enter into the liberty of the Kingdom of God. [510]
