The following document is taken from two sources.
The first, was acquired on a website (of which I can't remember the address)
listing as its source the book titled
Behold a Pale Horse by William Cooper, 1991.
The second source is a crudely copied booklet which does not contain a copyright notice, or a publishers name.
With the exception of the Forward, the Preface, the main thing that was missing from the first source was the illustrations.
As we began comparing the two, we realized that the illustrations, and the accompanying text (also missing from the first) made up a significant part of the document. We have no first-hand knowledge that this document is genuine, however many of the concepts contained herein are certainly reasonable, important,
and bear strong consideration.
