Terror laws enabling internet monitoring clear
Senate
Australia's spy agency could soon have the power
to monitor
the entire Australian internet after new
anti-terrorism laws
passed the Senate on Thursday night.
Australian spies will soon
have the power to monitor the entire Australian internet
with just one warrant, and journalists and
whistleblowers will face up to 10 years' jail for
disclosing classified information.
The government's first
tranche of tougher anti-terrorism bills, which will beef
up the powers of the domestic spy agency
ASIO, passed the Senate
by 44 votes to 12 on Thursday night with bipartisan
support from Labor.

The bill, the
National Security Legislation Amendment
Bill (No. 1)
2014 - (full
PDF
format) - will now be sent to the House of
Representatives, where passage is all but guaranteed on
Tuesday at the earliest.
Anyone - including
journalists, whistleblowers and bloggers - who
"recklessly" discloses,
"information... [that]
relates to a special intelligence operation"
faces up to 10 years' jail.
Any operation can be
declared "special" by an authorized ASIO officer.
The
senate votes on the bill on Thursday night.
This also gives ASIO
immunity for criminal and civil liability in certain
circumstances.
Many, including lawyers and
academics, have said they fear the agency will abuse
this power. Those who identify ASIO agents could also
face a decade in prison under the new bill, a tenfold
increase on the existing maximum penalty.
The new bill also allows
ASIO to seek just one warrant to access
a limitless number of computers on a computer
network when attempting to monitor a target, which
lawyers, rights groups, academics and Australian media
organizations have condemned.
They said this would
effectively allow the entire internet to be monitored,
as it is a "network of networks" and the bill does not
specifically define what a computer network is.
ASIO will also be able to
copy, delete, or modify the data held on any of the
computers it has a warrant to monitor.
The bill also allows ASIO to
disrupt target computers, and use innocent third-party
computers not targeted in order to access a target
computer. Professor George Williams of
the University of NSW has warned previously the bill was
too broad.
And, unlike the government's
controversial plans to get internet providers to store
metadata for up to two years, the bill passed on
Thursday allows for the content of communications to be
stored.
Most groups that had
complained about the new bill also said they feared its
disclosure offences went too far, with the Australian
Lawyers Alliance saying they would have "not just a
chilling effect but a freezing effect" on national
security reporting.
Attorney-General George
Brandis did not seek to allay their concerns on
Thursday but said that, in a "newly dangerous age", it
was vital that those protecting Australia were equipped
with the powers and capabilities they needed.
When the bill passed on
Thursday night, he said it was the most important reform
for Australia's intelligence agencies since the late
1970s.
On Wednesday afternoon,
Senator Brandis confirmed that, under the legislation,
ASIO would be able to use just one warrant to access
numerous devices on a network.
The warrant would be issued
by the director-general of ASIO or his deputy.
"There is no arbitrary
or artificial limit on the number of devices,"
Senator Brandis told the Senate.
However, Senator Brandis did
say on Thursday that the new bills did not target
journalists specifically, despite concerns from media
organizations that they would be targets.
The new legislation instead
targeted those who leaked classified information, such
as the former US National Security Agency contractor
Edward Snowden, Senator Brandis said.
"These provisions have
nothing to do with the press."
Despite this, Senator
Brandis refused to say whether reporting on cases
similar to Australia's foreign spy agency ASIS
allegedly bugging East Timor's cabinet and the
Australian Signals Directorate tapping
the Indonesian president and his wife's mobile phone
would result in journalists or whistleblowers being
jailed.
The Australian Greens,
through Senator Scott Ludlam, put forward an amendment
that would limit the number of computers ASIO could
access with one warrant to 20 but it failed to gain
support from Labor or the government.
Speaking after the bill
passed, Senator Ludlam told Fairfax Media he
was disappointed.
"What we've seen
[tonight] is, I think, a scary, disproportionate and
unnecessary expansion of coercive surveillance
powers that will not make anybody any safer but that
affect freedoms that have been quite hard fought for
and hard won over a period of decades," Senator
Ludlam said.
"I have very grave
concerns about the direction that the Australian
government seems to be suddenly taking the country."
Independent Senator Nick
Xenophon and Liberal Democratic Senator David Leyonhjelm
also put forward amendments that would protect
whistleblowers but these did not gain enough support
either.
The legislation, which also
covers a number of other issues, addresses many of the
recommendations of a joint parliamentary inquiry into
Australia's national security laws.
After concerns were raised
by Labor and Senator Leyonhjelm, the government agreed
to amend the legislation to specifically rule out ASIO
using torture.
"ASIO cannot, does not
and has never engaged in torture," Senator Brandis
said.
The Palmer United Party was
also successful in amending the law so anyone who
exposes an undercover ASIO operative could face up to 10
years behind bars instead of one.
"The internet poses one
of the greatest threats to our existence," Palmer
United Party Senator Glen Lazarus said, speaking out
against Senator Ludlam's amendment.
The Australian Greens voted
against the bill, slamming the new measures as extreme
and a "relentless expansion of powers" of the
surveillance state.
Senator Leyonhjelm and
Senator Xenophon also opposed the legislation, as
did independent Senator John Madigan.
One of the amendments put
forward by Senator Xenophon would have required ASIO's
watchdog, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and
Security, to report publicly each year on how many
devices ASIO accessed.
But Labor and the government
voted against it, with Senator Brandis saying it "would
not be appropriate" to report figures as it would reveal
information about ASIO's capabilities.
The legal changes come amid
growing concern over Islamic State extremists in the
Middle East and terrorism threats at home.
Islamic State (also known as
ISIL) has ordered followers to target civilian
Australians. In less than a week, police in two states
launched the biggest counter-terrorism raids in
Australia's history, and shot dead a known terrorist
suspect after he stabbed two officers in Melbourne.
A second anti-terrorism bill
targeting foreign fighters
was introduced in the Senate on Wednesday and will
be debated next month.
These changes have
opposition support and would make it a criminal office
to travel to a terrorist hot-spot without a reasonable
excuse.
A third bill enabling the
collection of internet and phone metadata for a period
of up to two years for warrantless access by
law-enforcement and spy agencies will be introduced
later this year.
