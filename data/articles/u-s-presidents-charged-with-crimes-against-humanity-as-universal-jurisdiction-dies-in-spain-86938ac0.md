In October 2009, under great pressure from the United States, the government
of Spain decided to limit its own jurisdiction in cases of genocide and
crimes against humanity, thus closing one of the last windows of
accountability for the most serious crimes committed by the most powerful
nations on Earth.
Under international law, such crimes fall under the
universal jurisdiction of any nation, whether ones own citizens are victims
or not. The logic is that crimes against humanity are offenses against every
member of the human species - a crime against all.
Spain had been a venue for bringing high crimes charges against human rights
violators in Guatemala, Argentina, China, Israel, and elsewhere.
Most of the
lawsuits have been against individuals linked to the untouchable political
right, such as,
-
Chiles Augusto Pinochet
-
the Argentine military officer
Adolfo Scilingo
-
former US secretary of state
Henry Kissinger
-
Italian prime
minister Silvio Berlusconi
-
former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon and
six of his senior advisors
-
most recently, former
George W. Bush administration
officials
Calls to reign in the judges increased when Spanish magistrates announced
probes involving Israel and the United States.
In January 2009, Spanish National Court Judge
Fernando Andreu announced he
would investigate seven current or former Israeli officials over a 2002 air
attack in Gaza that killed a top member of Hamas and fourteen other people.
In March 2009,
Baltasar Garzón, Spains most high-profile judge, invoked the
principle of universal jurisdiction when he sought to investigate six former
Bush administration officials for giving legal cover to torture in the
American prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
And in May 2009, another Spanish
high-court judge,
Santiago Pedraz, declared he would charge three US
soldiers with crimes against humanity for the April 2003 deaths of a Spanish
television cameraman and a Ukrainian journalist. The men were killed when a
US tank crew shelled their Baghdad hotel.
Activist judges like Garzón, Andreu, and Pedraz have created a big
diplomatic headache for the Zapatero government.
China has warned Spain that
bilateral relations could be damaged over a case regarding Tibet, and
Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Spain that it risks
being sidelined in the Middle East peace process.
But the Spanish government is most worried about the negative impact the
Guantánamo probe may have on relations with the United States.
Zapatero has
raised expectations of Spanish voters with the promise he can forge warm
ties to the Obama administration. Indeed, other European leaders have
distanced themselves from the Spanish position, fearful of jeopardizing
future relations with Washington.
Reporter Glen Ford noted that the worlds biggest potential defendant for
war crimes and crimes against humanity is the United States, whose record of
direct and indirect involvement in torture and mass killings has been
unmatched by any other nation since at least World War II. It was primarily
US pressure that forced Spain to close off its courts from international
jurisdiction cases.
A motion separate from Judge Garzóns was filed on April 27, 2010, by the
New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), which is seeking to
intervene as a party in the criminal investigation currently pending into
the US torture program in Guantánamo. The investigation focuses on the
torture and abuse of four former Guantánamo detainees with strong ties to
Spain.
CCR determines that, because of the nature of the alleged crimes and
Spains obligations as a signatory to the Geneva Conventions, the Convention
Against Torture in particular, Spain should retain jurisdiction over this
case.
For eight long years we have fought to redress the brutal, inhumane and
illegal acts perpetrated against our clients but have been blocked at every
turn by both the Bush and Obama administrations, said CCR President Michael
Ratner, who filed the first habeas corpus petition brought on behalf of a
Guantánamo detainee in 2002.
We come to Spain in pursuit of nothing less
than justice, which, sadly, is not available in the United States.
One day before the change in Spanish law, a number of members of the
BRussells Tribunal, acting under the umbrella of the International
Initiative to Prosecute US Genocide in Iraq, filed charges of crimes against
humanity and genocide against four presidents of the United States and four
prime ministers of Great Britain.
The charges cite 1.5 million Iraqi deaths
over the course of nineteen years of American and British attacks, including
two full-scale wars of aggression, the most draconian sanctions regime ever
designed, and subsequent occupation of Iraq.
Half a million of the dead,
according to the charges, were children.
In parallel, Iraqs rich heritage and unique cultural and archaeological
patrimony has been wantonly destroyed. In order to render Iraq dependent on
US and UK strategic designs, successive US and UK governments have attempted
to partition Iraq and to establish by military force a pro-occupation Iraqi
government and political system.
They have promoted and engaged in the
massive plunder of Iraqi natural resources, attempting to privatize the
property and wealth of the Iraqi nation.
So massive and systematic were the
assaults on Iraq, stretching for roughly a generation, the accusers charge
the US and the UK with the deliberate destruction of a nation.
The defendants are,
The suit holds that each has played a key role in Iraqs
intended destruction - that they instigated, supported, condoned,
rationalized, executed and/or perpetuated, or excused this destruction based
on lies and narrow strategic and economic interests, and against the will of
their own people.
The BRussels Tribunal asserts that allowing those
responsible to escape accountability means such actions could be repeated
elsewhere.
The global clearinghouse for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and
genocide is the
International Criminal Court. However Ford notes that in
recent years that court has prosecuted no one but Africans and is
increasingly exposed as a tool of Western hegemony.
The United States
refuses to join the International Criminal Court, and thus claims immunity
from prosecution.
Update by Glen Ford
Lawless United States has been offered a job as International Court
enforcer.
The impunity with which the United States and Britain caused the
deaths of 1.5 million Iraqis and the displacement of 4.7 million more during
two decades of uninterrupted aggression (1990 to present), is eclipsed in
scale of slaughter by the genocide in the eastern Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
An estimated 6 million Congolese have died since the main US
proxies in the region, Ugandas dictator Yoweri Museveni and Rwandas ruling
Tutsi military, poured across the DRCs borders in pursuit of approximately
1 million Rwandan Hutus displaced in the 1994 Rwandan civil war, including
the defeated Hutu militia.
Ugandan and Rwandan military commanders quickly established control over
mining operations in the mineral-rich region, providing raw materials to US-
and Europe-based extraction corporations - a mutually profitable business
relationship that thrives in an environment of terror and massacre. Despite
the fact that their activities in eastern Congo have resulted in a holocaust
equal to that under the Nazis, Rwanda and Uganda enjoy impunity as
Washingtons most loyal clients in Black Africa.
US
corporate media, led by
their collective noses by the US State Department, find genocidaires lurking
everywhere in Africa except among the US proxies in Kampala and Kigali.
Having failed to prosecute anyone but Africans since its creation in 2002,
the International Criminal Court (ICC) now actively woos the US,
the worlds most prolific perpetrator and sponsor of,
-
war crimes
-
crimes against
humanity
-
genocide,
...as global enforcer of ICC indictments.
The US
refuses to join the ICC, for fear it might be prosecuted for its own crimes
(only the 111 nations that have ratified the treaty fall under its
jurisdiction).
Yet ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo openly lobbies
for the US to head up a coalition of the willing to deploy special
forces as the enforcement arm of the Hague-based court.
Moreno-Ocampo apparently believes the global quest for justice would be
empowered by access to the rare and expensive capabilities of the worlds
most active war-maker, as reported by scholar-journalists Adam Branch and
Samar Al-Bulushi in the African journal Pambazuka.
The US also sees no
contradiction in acting as enforcer of international laws it neither
respects nor recognizes as binding.
Stephen Rapp, US ambassador at large for
war crimes, said Washington,
can support this court constructively when it
works in our interest. And so far in the cases it is taking on, they are in
our interests and in the interest of all of humankind.
The US was the center of attention, although officially only an observer, at
the ICCs latest conference (May 31June 11) in Kamala, Uganda.
Its hard
to emphasize how happy countries are to see us here, said State Department
legal adviser Harold Koh. They felt very distressed at the period of US
hostility to the court.
Washington remains, of course, unalterably opposed
to any limits on its superpower prerogatives, but welcomes Moreno-Ocampos
invitation to enforce the ICCs highly selective indictments.
The worlds biggest bully - a nation that proudly proclaims that the
law ends
where its own interests begin - is being offered the marshals badge.
Justice
cannot possibly be served.
Update by Ad Hoc Committee For Justice For Iraq
In October 2009, we filed in Madrid - on behalf of Iraqi victims - a legal case
against four US presidents and four UK prime ministers under laws of
universal jurisdiction for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide
in Iraq.
Our case spans nineteen years, including thirteen years of
sanctions proven to have an overwhelmingly destructive impact on Iraqi
public health, and the launching of an illegal war of aggression against
Iraq based on deliberate falsification and systematic efforts to hide from
the general public, in the US, the UK, and elsewhere, the true objectives of
the war.
Sanctions led to an estimated 1.5 million excess Iraqi deaths,
including 500,000 children under five.
To date, estimates of violent deaths
among Iraqis post-2003 run to 1.2 million. Some 5 million Iraqis have been
displaced inside and outside the country - a fifth of the entire population.
Despite the enormity of the crimes, the high profile of those accused, and a
full press campaign on the case, the filing got zero publicity in the
mainstream English-speaking media. In Spain, it was reported once in the
margins.
Only the alternative media carried our press releases, and only
those who listen to alternative media heard of the case. The mainstream
continued to propagate the lie - supposedly a criticism - that the US-led foray
into Iraq was a blunder. But it was not a blunder. Nor did the US wander
blind into a quagmire.
Our case charts the synchronicity of crimes
committed - including the destruction of civil infrastructure, indiscriminate
bombing and use of
depleted uranium, and promotion of sectarianism and
corruption, destruction of state institutions, urbicide, plunder, promotion
of torture - all leading to, and resulting in, the intended destruction of the
Iraqi state and nation. The humanitarian disaster that is present-day Iraq
was an end in itself.
This is what the mainstream media cannot say and
conceals.
We knew when we filed our case that public pressure would be instrumental.
Based on years of research and analysis, our case was filed one day before
the Spanish Senate voted, under external pressure, to radically circumscribe
the practice of universal jurisdiction in Spain. The silence of the
mainstream media surely contributed to the result.
The new law, imposed
retroactively, led to the closing of our case and others. Though Spanish
courts had been open to hearing human rights grievances from those unable to
find redress in their own countries or by other means, and though Spain had
been taking a lead role in efforts to address impunity in international
affairs, that window closed, virtually without comment. In real terms, our
case was censored.
But not only our case that was censored: in effect, Iraq,
too, has been censored.
How important is this failure of
the mainstream media?
The war on Iraq is
not only an attack on a sovereign country, it is a frontal attack on
international law. If the destruction of Iraq goes unaccounted for, what is
happening to Iraq could happen anywhere.
Thus we remain committed to working
toward the prosecution of crimes in Iraq perpetrated by the US and the UK.
Though Spain had been the clearest route for legal redress, new routes can
be opened.
Just as we look for allies in this work, we are ready to assist
similar initiatives taken up by others.
