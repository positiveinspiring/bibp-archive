Blatant lies told by alleged "human rights
activists" led to ignominious NATO-sanctioned brutality and ultimately
brought BP, Shell, Total-sponsored Petroleum Institute representative,
Abdurrahim el-Keib, into power in
Libya.
Now, these same corporate-financier interests,
through their same networks of propaganda, duplicity and deception, are
laying the groundwork for a repeat performance in Syria.
It was just recently revealed that the UN Human Rights Council
report regarding Syrian "crimes against
humanity" was actually co-authored by
Karen Koning AbuZayd, a director of the
US Washington-based corporate think-tank, Middle East Policy Council, that
includes,
...which includes amongst its membership,
The conflict of interest is so monumental it is
only outdone by the corporate media's eager acceptance of the report and
their complete negligence in airing the compromised backgrounds of those
responsible for compiling it.
The
UN report itself contained no verifiable evidence, but rather
hearsay accounts recorded in Geneva by,
alleged "victims" "witnesses," and
"defectors," put forth by "all interested persons and organizations."
In other words, it was an open invitation for
Syria's enemies to paint whatever image of the ruling government they
pleased.
While critics claim this is due to the Syrian
government's lack of cooperation with the UN, it is more likely that the UN
itself, with a proven track record of doing so in Iraq, the Ivory Coast, and
most recently Libya, is merely complicit in
providing "window dressing" for Wall Street and London's otherwise naked
military conquests.
How to Start the War
And it is through this purposefully distorted lens that calls for military
intervention are being made.
After months of denying the opposition was
armed, the Wall Street-funded think-tank Council on Foreign Relations
(CFR)
now
openly claims that not only are the
"protesters" armed, but there is a resistance army of "15,000."
The CFR claims this "Free Syrian Army" is
requesting weapons and air support. It has already been revealed that
weapons are freely flowing over Syria's borders from foreign-supporters,
most notably, Turkey,
Lebanon, Israel, and now even as far as
Libya.
The CFR report then goes on to explore the
options available to NATO for facilitating "regime change" including the use
of "overhead surveillance assets, logistical enablers, peacekeepers, armed
drones, combat aircraft, ground troops," and "smuggled weapons."
Of course the number of Syrian defectors are as baseless as the UN human
rights report. However, even the claim of a large, armed militant force
operating inside of Syria directly contradicts the West's concurrent
narrative that Syria's military is running rampant over defenseless
civilians.
With an army of "15,000 defectors" attempting to
seize the nation by force with the help of foreign money, weapons, and
diplomatic support, one finds it difficult to believe the Syrian government
would instead be spending its time "massacring civilians."
Just as in Libya, or any number of nations where
foreign-backed "revolutions" have been attempted or achieved,
Western-enabled violence is always a predetermined part of the equation,
fully provisioned ahead of time with the subsequent violence cloaked behind
tales of one-sided brutality aimed at the targeted regime.
As mentioned in the corporate-funded Brookings Institution report "Which
Path to Persia?"
the inclusion of covert armed support for US-backed protests is not just an
option, but a necessity when carrying out such operations within a nation
possessing competent security forces.
Page 109-110:
Consequently, if the United States ever
succeeds in sparking a revolt against the clerical regime, Washington
may have to consider whether to provide it with some form of military
support to prevent Tehran from crushing it.
This requirement means that a popular
revolution in Iran does not seem to fit the model of the 'velvet
revolutions' that occurred elsewhere. The point is that the Iranian
regime may not be willing to go gently into that good night; instead,
and unlike so many Eastern European regimes, it may choose to fight to
the death.
In those circumstances, if there is not
external military assistance to the revolutionaries, they might not just
fail but be massacred.
Consequently, if the United States is to pursue this policy, Washington
must take this possibility into consideration.
It adds some very important requirements to
the list:
either the policy must include ways to
weaken the Iranian military or weaken the willingness of the
regimes leaders to call on the military, or else the United States
must be ready to intervene to defeat it.
In addition to this confession by the Brookings
Institution, this pattern of providing for, or covering up the existence of,
armed elements deployed during the opening phases of a color revolution has
also been documented in Libya, Syria, and in Bangkok, Thailand in 2010.
Just as in Libya where legions of Al Qaeda
rebels armed by NATO and fresh back from killing US and British troops in
Iraq and Afghanistan were initially covered up with tales of street
protesting youth being cut down by Qaddafi's troops, Syria too has been
plagued by violent militants since the unrest began earlier this year.
In April's "Globalist
War Machine Fixates on Syria," the first reports of the now
ubiquitous snipers terrorizing Syria began to surface.
Also noted was the similarity between these
sniper attacks and concurrent attacks being carried out in Yemen, and the
year before in Thailand - all victims of Western-backed destabilization.
It will be through a perpetual campaign of deceit waged by the West's
various puppet regimes and their compromised corporate-media that this war
will be started. The ruling regime in Syria will be portrayed as grotesque
human rights offenders, while covert arms and support are provided to a
mercenary army of ever-increasing size, committing ever greater
provocations.
In time, as the proper "international" legal
maneuvers are performed, this mercenary army will be provided NATO air and
naval support, NATO special forces, and potentially NATO ground troops -
this of course includes Turkey, a NATO member since 1952 and already deeply
involved in
meddling in Syria's sovereign affairs.
How to Stop the War
While the power behind this war machine grinding up the planet seems
monolithic and unstoppable, the very source of its power looks us back in
the mirror every day.
We, through our choices of how we spend our
time, money, and attention, are fueling daily its destructive consumption of
our world.
While protests, elections, and activism are
important, what is absolutely essential is to entirely cut this machine off
from its fuel. That is, for us to boycott the corporations, institutions,
and personalities that constitute it to the point of starvation and
submission.
We must work ceaselessly to
identify and expose who these corporations, institutions, and
personalities are through the alternative media, boycott them out of
business, and replace them entirely with local solutions derived from both
tradition and technological innovation.
The Greatest Generation said "never again" to the rise of fascism in the
1930s and 1940s, yet here we are again watching the rise of Wall Street and
London to sickening heights of unwarranted power and warmongering.
Let this generation say, "not in our names" and
starve this beast into submission, just as
it has done to so many other sovereign nations.
