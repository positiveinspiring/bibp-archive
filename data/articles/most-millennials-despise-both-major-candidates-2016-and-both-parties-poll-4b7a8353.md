# Most Millennials Despise Both Major Candidates 2016 and Both Parties - 
Poll

A
new poll of Americans aged
18-30 finds we Millennials continue to have a low level of
confidence in Republicans and Democrats, as less than a third of
us are willing to claim the,
"two major parties do a good job
of representing the American people."
The GOP gets the boot from more than
two in three young adults, and though Democrats fared better,
they hardly receive a ringing endorsement.
Among white Millennials in
particular, 52 percent said the Democratic Party doesn't care
about them.
The poll also asked Millennials
about the two parties' candidates for president,
Hillary Clinton and
Donald Trump, and disenchantment levels only grew.
Young people may be able to muster
some enthusiasm for the parties in the abstract, but thinking
about these two politicians in particular makes that really
difficult.
Half said Clinton isn't qualified to
be president - a baseline question that doesn't require one to
support a candidate to answer affirmatively - and three in four
said the same about Trump. Those are damning numbers, and yet
completely expected from the most
politically independent
generation
ever.
For Clinton, the survey further
zeroed in on whether she intentionally broke the law by using a
private email server while secretary of state.
Now, Clinton
has never been very popular
with this generation (she got
absolutely walloped by
Bernie Sanders among that demographic in the primaries), so
it's perhaps not surprising that survey respondents generally
took a low view of her email
habits.
Just 8 percent - fewer than one in
10 - said she did nothing wrong, and 63 percent said she
broke the law. Of that majority, most (43 percent vs. 20
percent) say Clinton's lawbreaking was intentional, though white
Millennials were harder on her in this regard than minorities.
Together, all this reiterates what
I've argued for a while.
Millennials like me have grown into
adulthood with an awful economy and
constant war.
Every fresh news day seems to bring
yet another report of some dastardly way the government is
violating our liberties and trampling the rule of law. It's easy
for us to recognize the need for real and lasting change.
That's why someone like Sanders or
Ron Paul is so appealing - we aren't interested in just fiddling
around the margins of politics, which is basically the promise
of a Clinton White House.
And the 2016 election has clarified
the sort of change young Americans want. In short, it's not the
protectionist, hawkish, discriminatory approach Donald Trump is
offering.
Though this generation does lean
left (as young people historically have), Millennials are
comparatively conservative with
our money, ready for a more responsible foreign policy, and disinterested in
running other people's lives.
That's good news and further
evidence that libertarianism could well win out.
Most Young Americans say...
Parties Don't Represent Them

WASHINGTON (AP)
Most young Americans say the
Republican and Democratic parties don't represent them, a
critical data point after a year of ferocious presidential
primaries that forced partisans on both sides to confront what -
and whom - they stand for.
That's according to a new GenForward poll that shows the
disconnect holds true across racial and ethnic groups, with just
28 percent of young adults overall saying the two major parties
do a good job of representing the American people.
The poll shows that despite this across-the-board feeling of
disenchantment with the two-party system, the Democratic Party
holds a clear advantage in appealing to young people of color.
But among young whites, majorities feel left out by both
parties.
More than two-thirds of young adults, including vast majorities
of young Asian-Americans, Hispanics and blacks, say the
Republican Party does not care about people like them.
Democrats fare a bit better among young people overall, with a
small majority - 53 percent - saying the party cares about
people like them.
Among young African-Americans,
Hispanics and Asian-Americans, most believe the party does care
about people like them. But among young whites, majorities say
both parties don't care much about them, including 58 percent
who say that of the Republican Party and 52 percent who say it
about the Democratic Party.
GenForward is a survey by the
Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the
Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
The first-of-its-kind poll pays
special attention to the voices of young adults of color,
highlighting how race and ethnicity shape the opinions of a new
generation.
The results of the survey of Americans age 18-30 reflect
something of an identity crisis for both parties heading into
the future, driven in part by deep antipathy toward the
presidential candidates they nominated.
Republican Donald Trump and
Democrat
Hillary Clinton, the two
least-popular presidential nominees in the history of
modern polling, were opposed by large and bitter swaths of
their parties.
Young people aren't certain to fall in line behind the nominees,
the survey found.
Three-quarters of young adults say
the billionaire real estate magnate is unqualified to be
president even after he vanquished 16 GOP rivals. Half say the
same of Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, after
unlikely rival Bernie Sanders forced her to fight for the
nomination for a year.
Emiliano Vera, 22, of Bushnell, Illinois, says he isn't
coming back to the Democratic Party that attracted him with
Barack Obama's nomination
in 2008.
Ideology this year drew him to
Sanders. But disenchantment with what seemed like an obviously
rigged nomination process in Clinton's favor, he says, is what's
pushing him to the Green Party.
Leaked Democratic National Committee
emails confirmed for him that the party had their thumb on the
scale for Clinton, Vera said.
"This is the last straw for me,"
said Vera, part of the majority of young Sanders supporters
on whom Clinton cannot depend for votes, the survey found.
This year, he says, his friends
agree that the Democratic Party generally is the "lesser evil"
to the GOP's Trump.
But the future, he says, is a
different picture.
But for all the disenchantment, young adults across racial and
ethnic groups are mostly unfamiliar with their alternatives.
Seven in 10 say they don't know enough about Libertarian
presidential candidate Gary Johnson to have an opinion
about him, and nearly 8 in 10 say the same about Green Party
candidate Jill Stein.
The 18-30 age group tends not to be a conservative constituency,
so the survey contains critical data particularly for Democrats
and Clinton, who has said she knows she has "work to do" to
appeal to the young people who flocked to Sanders during the
primary.
Rachel Mace, 20, is an example of the challenge faced by
Democrats and Clinton in particular.
The Farmington, Michigan, resident
supported Sanders and says she wants to see one party make "a
meaningful commitment" to public financing of campaigns.
She doubts she'll ever see a party,
or a candidate, seek that reform voluntarily.
"There's more hope, I think, for
the Democratic Party, but we're going to have to force
them," Mace said.
As for Clinton,
"I find her to be incredibly
corrupt."
Young people across racial and
ethnic groups were more likely to support Sanders than Clinton
in their primary battle this spring, and among young Sanders
supporters, less than half - 43 percent - say they'll support
Clinton against Trump in the fall election.
Three percent say they'll support
Trump, with the rest saying they're undecided, will vote for a
third-party candidate or will not vote.
The poll of 1,940 adults age 18-30 was conducted July 9-20 using
a sample drawn from the probability-based GenForward panel,
which is designed to be representative of the U.S. young adult
population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is
plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.
The survey was paid for by the Black Youth Project at the
University of Chicago, using grants from the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Ford Foundation.
Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based
sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone.
