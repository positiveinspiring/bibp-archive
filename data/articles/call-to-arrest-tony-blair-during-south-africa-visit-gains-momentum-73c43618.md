Former British Prime
Minister Tony Blair is in town this week to address a
leadership summit in Johannesburg.
He may want to watch his
back, though: a group called the Society for the
Protection of our Constitution has launched an urgent
application to the NPA to issue a warrant for Blairs
arrest for the 2003 Iraq invasion.

If Tony Blair secretly yearns for the
quiet life, he hides it well.
Since his resignation as Prime Minister in 2007,
he has seemed busier than ever:
serving as a Middle East peace envoy,
consulting to a number of corporations, launching his own charity and an
interfaith foundation and touring the world as a private speaker.
It is with this latter role that he travels to
South Africa this week, to address the Discovery Invest Leadership Summit
at the Sandton Convention Centre.
The event, which has the tagline: Intellectual Capital Shared, describes
its aims thus:
In the knowledge economy, those who best
understand todays economic, political and social challenges are the
ones who succeed. They are also the ones who can discern the true value
of Intellectual Capital.
Discoverys financial heft has helped line up a
stellar roster of speakers:
Blair appears alongside the likes of,
-
Archbishop Desmond Tutu
-
Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan
-
UK supermarket
guru Sir Terry Leahy
-
Co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International,
Richard Gnodde
Also on the speakers list is Russian chess
grandmaster and opposition politician Garry Kasparov, who for a while looked
unlikely to attend after being detained by Russian authorities on 17 August
following his attendance of a rally in support of imprisoned feminist punk
band Pussy Riot.
Kasparov was unexpectedly acquitted of all
charges by the Khamovniki court on Friday, however, so it looks like hell
be free to travel after all.
Past speakers at the conference have included,
-
former US Vice President
Al Gore
-
former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani
-
ABSA group CEO Maria Ramos
-
Mvelaphandla Holdings Tokyo Sexwale
It would be interesting to know how much Blair
will be taking home from this gig. It has been claimed that he is one of the
most expensive public speakers in the world, allegedly commanding fees of
up to £6,000 a minute.
In March this year it was reported that the
Stanford University students association approached Blair to give a talk
and were quoted $50,000 for security and transport costs alone.
In addition, British tabloids claimed late last
week that Blair continues to cost the British taxpayer around £400,000 per
year:
He draws the maximum Prime Ministerial
pension of £70,000 (allegedly declined by successor Gordon Brown for
being too generous), receives a £115,000 allowance for carrying out his
public work and has a permanent security detail costing at least
£250,000 per year.
The reason for that high security bill is that
Blair may be a big-name draw, but he also has a chequered reputation, and
where he travels, trouble often follows.
Earlier this month it was reported by the
Mail & Guardian that the South African Muslim Network executive
committee was unhappy about Blair being given a platform by the Discovery
Summit to lecture on leadership, given his role in the invasion of Iraq in
2003. The newspaper reported the committee was in talks about protest
actions that might be taken if Blair were to arrive, including marches and
sit-ins.
They said at the time they were investigating
the feasibility of having a warrant of arrest issued against him.
Now a group called the Society for the Protection of Our Constitution
has gone one step further, announcing Sunday it had launched an urgent
application to the National Prosecuting Authority to have a warrant of
arrest issued for Blair for the allegedly illegal authorization of the Iraq
War.
The claim that the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was illegal is fairly widely
held, and is based on the fact that Blair (and George W Bush) failed to
obtain authorization from the UN Security Council beforehand.
Leaked memos from 2002 have shown that
then-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw informed Blair the proposed
invasion would not meet the criteria required for legality.
A key requirement for a legal war is that it
must be declared by a state anticipating or experiencing an armed attack, a
scenario subsequently found not to be the case in the Iraq war. Blair also
admitted that he disregarded the initial warning of his attorney general,
Lord Goldsmith, that the invasion would be illegal.
The BBC has reported that US Department of Defence tallied 4,487 US military
personnel killed in Iraq between March 2003 and July 2010. It reported 179
British soldiers dying in the same period and cited sources suggesting
between 97,461 and 106,348 Iraqi civilians were killed in that span.
In November 2011, a body called the
Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission
conducted
a tribunal to try George W Bush and
Tony Blair in absentia for crimes
against peace, crimes against humanity and genocide. The tribunal was
presided over by five judges and included representations on behalf of the
defendants made by court-appointed defence counsel.
The unanimous verdict found Bush and Blair
guilty, but acknowledged the verdict was non-enforceable, though the
findings were reported to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
The neutrality of proceedings were questionable,
however, as the tribunal was the initiative of former Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is staunchly anti-West and has accused
the ICC of bias in terms of the figures it chooses to prosecute.
The official UK government inquiry into the Iraq War,
the Chilcot Inquiry, is only set to release
a report late into 2013, which will run more than 1-million words (twice the
size of War and Peace).
Part of the delay is due to a row over whether
Cabinet officials are willing to publish certain sensitive documents, such
as notes passed between Blair and Bush, and records of their conversations.
The inquiry held public hearings between the end of 2009 and the beginning
of 2011 on matters including the background to the war. When Blair came to
testify, in January 2010, the British public were electrified as to whether
he would express regret about the war.
It was only at the end of his testimony that he
got down to this question.
I feel, of course, I had to take this
decision as Prime Minister and it was a huge responsibility then, and
there is not a single day that passes by that I dont reflect and think
about responsibility, and so I should, he said.
But I genuinely believe that if we had left
Saddam in power, even with what we know now, we would still have had to
have dealt with him, possibly in circumstances where the threat was
worse and possibly in circumstances where it was hard to mobilize any
support for dealing with that threat.
And no regrets? the inquiry Chairman then
pushed.
Responsibility, but not a regret for
removing Saddam Hussein. I think he was a monster, Blair replied. I
believe he threatened not just the region but the world.
Earlier this year, Blair attracted criticism
again when he appeared before
the Leveson Inquiry into UK media ethics to
give evidence about his relationship with Rupert Murdoch (known to be close,
because Blair is the godfather to Murdochs daughter Grace).
It had emerged that Blair had taken time off
from his busy PMs schedule to make three phone calls to Murdoch in the
build-up to the Iraq invasion in 2003. It is now widely believed the purpose
of these calls was to lobby Murdoch for positive press coverage of the war.
Blair denied this at the inquiry, saying,
I would have been wanting to explain what
we are doing. I dont think theres anything particularly odd about
that.
At his Leveson hearing, Blair was nonetheless
confronted by a protestor from the Alternative Iraq Inquiry bursting
into the room to yell,
This man is a war criminal!
Over the past few years he has also been
subjected to at least four attempts by members of the public to issue a
citizens arrest on him for war crimes, spurred by the
Arrest Blair website, which is currently advertising Blairs
attendance at the Johannesburg summit.
The website, established by environmentalist and
Guardian columnist George Monbiot, collects donations to financially
reward anyone who attempts to carry out a peaceful citizens arrest on
Blair.
Given the fact that Blair has been dealing with these issues for more than
five years, then, news that certain South African quarters are unhappy with
his attendance at the leadership summit is unlikely to come as much surprise
to him.
What may surprise him, however, is the confidence with which the Society for
the Protection of our Constitution is approaching their legal bid. The
Daily Maverick Sunday spoke to Salman Khan, a spokesman for Zehir
Omar, a lawyer for the organization, rather than the Society as a whole.
When asked whether the Societys legal bid had
any chance of success, he replied:
Big, big. The persons behind it are
heavyweights of South African society. The research has been extensive,
the dossier is big and anyone of juridistic mind can see that it will be
successful.
The Society for the Protection of Our
Constitution has had an eclectic record of concerns up till now.
Some of the issues it has successfully tackled
have been prosaic: in June 2011 it secured a court order against the mayor
of the Victor Khanye Local Municipality in Mpumalanga to force it to repair
potholes.
In March last year, the Society launched a legal objection to the Muslim
Marriages Bill, calling it anti-Islamic and saying sharia law was not
compatible with the Constitution.
Among the concerns it cited at the time was that
the bill might be amended in line with the Constitution to allow same-sex
marriage, prohibited by Islam.
Most curiously, however, in November 2008 it appealed to the Cape High Court
to delay the hearing of the NPA appeal against the scrapping of Jacob Zumas
corruption charges, saying the court date should be changed till after the
2009 elections because Zuma would not be able to campaign effectively while
having to deal with a court case at the same time. At the time, the M&G
reported that the Society announced that all its members were ANC members.
The affidavit in the Blair matter, seen by the Daily Maverick, states,
the various actions by Tony Blair fit in
with the definitions of inter alia, Crimes Against Humanity, War Crimes
and Crimes of Aggression and warrant his arrest upon him setting foot in
South Africa due to our obligation via our requirement to uphold the
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
Blair invaded with no backup from the UN or
the UK parliament. He went against the wishes of the masses, Khan said,
claiming the invasion was motivated partly by a desire to appease the US
and partly by interest in Iraqs oil reserves.
American foreign policy for the past 100
years has been motivated by dependence on oil, he said.
Khan said the group expected to hear back from
the NPA by Monday afternoon, and if its bid failed, the next step would be
an interdict from the High Court.
They will also be organizing a protest outside
Discoverys Johannesburg headquarters Thursday afternoon, though Khan was at
pains to stress that the beef was not with Discovery, which is merely
hosting Blair.
If legal channels fail, would the group consider attempting a citizens
arrest?
Of course yes! Khan replied.
There will be hundreds. Not for the money,
he added (referencing the bounty up for grabs from the Arrest Blair
website), but to send a strong message.
Are there any other world leaders they would
like to see similarly prosecuted for war crimes?
Anyone involved in an illegal invasion, he
said.
Neither Discovery nor the NPA responded to
comment on the issue of Blairs arrest warrant on Sunday.
Given South Africas infamous timidity when it
comes to rocking the boat with international figures, however, it seems
highly unlikely that the Societys appeal will come to anything.
In all likelihood, the worst Blair can probably
expect is some accusations yelled at him from afar by protestors.
