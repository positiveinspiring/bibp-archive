A short production of news clips detailing
George W. Bush's
9/11 inaction,
including his post-attack foot dragging on establishing an independent
investigation into the worst attack ever on United States soil.
Bush was clearly negligent in his duty on 9/11, not only as President, but
also as our Commander in Chief. His inaction alone is reason enough to
re-open the 9/11 investigation.
Throw in the fact that Donald Rumsfeld was
not at his post directing a defense for this country, and that Dick Cheney
tracked the Pentagon attack "vehicle" from over 50 miles out and still did
not shoot the object down, and you have negligence and dereliction of duty
at the highest levels of the U.S. government.
Don't just ask for a new investigation... Ask for a real 9/11 investigation!
