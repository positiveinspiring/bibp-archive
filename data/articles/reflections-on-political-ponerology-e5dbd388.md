After reading the incredible book
Political
Ponerology: A science on the nature of evil adjusted for political purposes
by Andrew Lobaczewski, I had a transcendental moment of realization
(sort of an "Eureka!" moment).
I have to conclude that
ponerology and
psychopathy are two significant concepts that best explain the sorry state
of human affairs in this world which continue to negatively impact on our
society, our lives, and our future. No, I don't think it has anything to do
with "greed" or even "moral weakness" (however you define it). It has to do
with psychopathology and its influence on the nature of evil in society.
People in positions of power that systematically
perpetuate evil behave as if they were a different human species; a 'para-Homo
sapiens,' if you will. No matter how much good will there is in the world,
there continues to be much war, suffering and injustice.
It doesn't seem to
matter what plan, ideology, religion, or philosophy great minds come up
with, nothing seems to improve our lot. And it has been that way for
thousands of years, repeating over and over again.
We rationalize evil's
existence as being part of "human nature," a necessary part of the
complexity of the world, due to perennial greed or lack of enlightenment,
triggered by mutually exclusive competing interests, etc.; however, those
who subscribe to these principles and attitudes may have rendered a
premature judgment and closed the book on evil without examining all
evidence from different, previously unexamined points of view.
Ponerology and "successful" psychopathology, i.e. not the "violent serial killer" type, but the,
...type, clinically
explain how "pathocracies" - the system of government created by a small
pathological minority that takes control over a society of non-psychopaths -
are generated and dominated by those that possess an inborn error (psychopathy)
prevalent in 4-6% of the population which is physiologically unable to feel
normal human empathy.
They are emotionless, selfish, cold and calculating,
and devoid of any moral or ethical standards, yet they are intelligent,
charming, driven, focused, and therefore tend to achieve the highest
positions of power by concealing their true nature under a "mask of sanity"
(see
The Mask of Sanity).
This concept applies to all existing hierarchical power structures.
The psychopath shows an astounding lack of
normal physiological response to, for example, "emotionally-charged" words
such as "rape," "death," or "cancer;" their emotional reactions to these
words are similar to the reaction to "car," "chair," or "door" (which
largely differs from normal subjects).
This difference has been clearly
shown with functional MRI and PET scanning by Dr Robert Hare (he also
contributed to the documentary
The Corporation,
which shows that today's corporations - and, of course, the government -
fulfill
all the clinical criteria of a psychopath):
Using an innate lack of remorse and the ability
to use this "advantage" against an unsuspecting population (as well as an
uncanny ability to spot and join in common goals with other psychopaths in
the group), the psychopath's underhanded and predatory agendas are advanced
to progressively dominate, alienate, and manipulate the other 96% of
non-psychopathic people into sociopathic (defined as acquired psychopathy)
relationships, behaviors, and the perpetuation of institutional dysfunction,
as they become the leaders of the power centers of society.
Their influence
slowly challenges long-held values and cleverly manipulates empathic people
- who are unsuspecting of or cannot fathom anyone capable of such schemes
since they themselves have a conscience - to their advantage.
Sociopathy
insidiously infiltrates the zeitgeist and is progressively seen as
tolerable, or it is implicitly allowed to exist and spread by inaction.
This is where we find ourselves today, where,
for example, cheating and lying seem to be increasingly prevalent and
"accepted" behaviors, almost seen as virtues by some (unless they are caught
in the act).
This telling article shows the infiltration of this sociopathic
doublethink, justifying cheating in the eyes of 75% of college students as a
reasonable behavior in order to achieve "success," based on traits overtly
displayed by our leaders.
These concepts will continue to adversely shape
the present and future of humanity unless people with a conscience awaken
from their lack of awareness and/or apathy to this reality and do something
to stop the influence of psychopaths on society. Once the mask of the
psychopath comes down and his/her modus operandi is deciphered and
challenged, their power over their unsuspecting victims disappears.
I believe it is really that simple and that
profound. Let's stop giving the psychopaths a pass and consistently call
them on it every time!
This is the only chance we have to meaningfully turn
the tide, and it simply involves consistent personal action to relentlessly
oppose psychopathy and sociopathy; otherwise, we will become and propagate
what we allow.
In other words, as Edmund Burke once said,
"all it takes for
evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing."
Our inaction will only
embolden psychopaths to seek more power and perpetuate their dysfunctional
world view to humanity's ultimate detriment.
Relatedly,
the Milgram Experiment ties in
nicely with this concept.
If you are unfamiliar with this experiment, in
1961, on the heels of certain Nazi war crimes trials, a psychologist named
Stanley Milgram conducted this experiment across a range of 40 individuals
to test their response to authoritative pressure.
They were directed by the
experimenter to deliver what they believed to be real electric shocks to
another participant (actually an actor).
The results shocked everyone. Only 1.2% of
individuals were predicted to administer the highest voltage (450 volts); 26
of the 40 participants (65%) - some with clearly conflicted consciences -
delivered this lethal electric shock.
The only duress placed on the subjects
was verbal cueing from a man in a white lab coat!
You can imagine the
disastrous results derived from the combination of conscience-lacking
psychopaths as the authorities in executive power circles and the masses of
people obeying such "authority" blindly in such large proportions, as
shown in this experiment (below video):

Eventually, as a society, we should perhaps
consider making psychopathy screening mandatory before any politician or
public servant presents his/her candidacy for office, any military recruits
are enlisted, and before any candidates to any position of power that has
any public influence are even considered.
In the same way we would not allow
a color-blind person to safely work, for example, as an air-traffic
controller (since the inability to discern certain colors would put large
numbers of unsuspecting people at high risk for disaster...), society
probably shouldn't let a clinically-diagnosed psychopath be in a position of
power (again, don't give the pyromaniac the matches or put a pedophile in
charge of the day-care center).
Additionally, it is not necessary or advisable
for society to judge these people on moral grounds, as their actions do not
involve "moral judgments" per se on the part of the psychopath (at least not
in the same sense that a non-psychopathic person's normal decisions based on
internal struggles with free will and choice are classified as "moral" or
"immoral"), but involve an inevitable, hard-wired or learned physio-psychological
response; we wouldn't morally judge the color-blind person because he can't
see green.
Moral judgments would simply miss the etiology of the problem and
misdirect the possible solutions.
When one comes to understand that the reins of
political and economic power are in the hands of people who have no
conscience, who have no capacity for empathy, it opens up a completely new
way of looking at what we call "evil."
Evil is no longer only a moral issue;
it can now be analyzed and understood scientifically.
And so it should be
approached and treated in the same way we would approach the treatment of
pneumonia with antibiotics.
We should systematically eliminate ("treat") the
psychopath's deleterious effects on other individuals' lives and society in
general by keeping them away from positions of power, given their
physiological and psychological disability (which, by the way, research
shows to be non-respondent and undeterred by therapy, punishment, or
rehabilitation...).
At the individual level, a way for non-psychopaths to
deal with this situation would be to respectfully question authority every
time (as this authority may be - and likely will be - psychopathic), and to
consistently, forcefully, and predictably speak out when sociopathic
behavior is experienced or witnessed in our own lives.
In the same way
the
Nuremberg trials defined that a soldier shouldn't follow illegal orders, in
a parallel way perhaps we should endorse the notion that people shouldn't
follow or silently condone sociopathic or psychopathic behaviors.
This, of
course, is ultimately a matter of personal choice and responsibility;
however, once the dynamic of evil is discovered and seen for what it truly
is, we will be more likely and more able to make the right choices.
By recognizing this reality and understanding
the deleterious effect derived from the combination of,
-
psychopathic ponerogenesis (evil creation)
-
the propagation of pathocracies throughout
history
-
social apathy
-
the natural tendency of normal people to submit
to authority,
...hopefully we'll be able to act in such a way as to effect a
better future for ourselves and future generations, so that true human
nature can once and for all break free from the chains and shine through.
Unimpeded by sociopathic or psychopathic
influences we finally have a chance to achieve a more peaceful, free, and
humane world.
