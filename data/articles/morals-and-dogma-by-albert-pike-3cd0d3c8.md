X. ILLUSTRIOUS ELECT OF THE FIFTEEN.[Elu of the Fifteen ]THIS Degree is devoted to the same objects as those of the Elu of Nine;and also to the cause of Toleration and Liberality against Fanaticism andPersecution, political and religious; and to that of Education, Instruction,and Enlightenment against Error, Barbarism, and Ignorance. To theseobjects you have irrevocably and forever devoted your hand, your heart,and your intellect; and whenever in your presence a Chapter of thisDegree is opened, you will be most solemnly reminded of your vows heretaken at the altar.Toleration, holding that every other man has the same right to his opinionand faith that we have to ours; and liberality, holding that as no humanbeing can with certainty say, in the clash and conflict of hostile faiths andcreeds, what is truth, or that he is surely in possession of it, so every oneshould feel that it is quite possible that another equally honest and sincerewith himself, and yet holding the contrary opinion, may himself be inpossession of the truth, and that whatever one firmly and conscientiouslybelieves, is truth, to him - these are the mortal enemies of that fanaticismwhich persecutes for opinion's sake, and initiates crusades againstwhatever it, in its imaginary holiness, deems to be contrary to the law ofGod or verity of dogma. And education, instruction, and enlightenment arethe most certain means by which fanaticism and intolerance can berendered powerless.No true Mason scoffs at honest convictions and an ardent zeal in thecause of what one believes to be truth and justice. But hedoes absolutely deny the right of any man to assume the prerogative ofDeity, and condemn another's faith and opinions as deserving to bepunished because heretical. Nor does he approve the course of those whoendanger the peace and quiet of great nations, and the best interest oftheir own race by indulging in a chimerical and visionary philanthropy - aluxury which chiefly consists in drawing their robes around them to avoidcontact with their fellows, and proclaiming themselves holier than they.For he knows that such follies are often more calamitous than the ambitionof kings; and that intolerance and bigotry have been infinitely greatercurses to mankind than ignorance and error. Better any error thanpersecution! Better any opinion than the thumb-screw, the rack, and thestake! And he knows also how unspeakably absurd it is, for a creature towhom himself and everything around him are mysteries, to torture andslay others, because they cannot think as he does in regard to theprofoundest of those mysteries, to understand which is utterly beyond thecomprehension of either the persecutor or the persecuted.Masonry is not a religion. He who makes of it a religious belief, falsifiesand denaturalizes it. The Brahmin, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Catholic,the Protestant, each professing his peculiar religion, sanctioned by thelaws, by time, and by climate, must needs retain it, and cannot have tworeligions; for the social and sacred laws adapted to the usages, manners,and prejudices of particular countries, are the work of men.But Masonry teaches, and has preserved in their purity, the cardinal tenetsof the old primitive faith, which underlie and are the foundation of allreligions. All that ever existed have had a basis of truth; and all haveoverlaid that truth with errors. The primitive truths taught by the Redeemerwere sooner corrupted, and intermingled and alloyed with fictions thanwhen taught to the first of our race. Masonry is the universal moralitywhich is suitable to the inhabitants of every clime, to the man of everycreed. It has taught no doctrines, except those truths that tend directly tothe well-being of man; and those who have attempted to direct it towarduseless vengeance, political ends, and Jesuitism, have merely perverted itto purposes foreign to its pure spirit and real nature.Mankind outgrows the sacrifices and the mythologies of the childhood ofthe world. Yet it is easy for human indolence tolinger near these helps, and refuse to pass further on. So theunadventurous Nomad in the Tartarian wild keeps his flock in the sameclose-cropped circle where they first learned to browse, while theprogressive man roves ever forth "to fresh fields and pastures new."The latter is the true Mason; and the best and indeed the only goodMason is he who with the power of business does the work of life; theupright mechanic, merchant, or farmer, the man with the power of thought,of justice, or of love, he whose whole life is one great act of performanceof Masonic duty. The natural case of the strength of a strong man or thewisdom of a wise one, is to do the work of a strong man or a wise one.The natural work of Masonry is practical life; the use of all the faculties intheir proper spheres, and for their natural function. Love of Truth, justice,and generosity as attributes of God, must appear in a life marked by thesequalities; that is the only effectual ordinance of Masonry. A profession ofone's convictions, joining the Order, assuming the obligations, assisting atthe ceremonies, are of the same value in science as in Masonry; thenatural form of Masonry is goodness, morality, living a true, just,affectionate, self-faithful life, from the motive of a good man. It is loyalobedience to God's law.The good Mason does the good thing which comes in his way, andbecause it comes in his way; from a love of duty, and not merely becausea law, enacted by man or God, commands his will to do it. He is true to hismind, his conscience, heart, and soul, and feels small temptation to do toothers what he would not wish to receive from them. He will deny himselffor the sake of his brother near at hand. His desire attracts in the line ofhis duty, both being in conjunction. Not in vain does the poor or theoppressed look up to him. You find such men in all Christian sects,Protestant and Catholic, in all the great religious parties of the civilizedworld, among Buddhists, Mahometans, and Jews. They are kind fathers,generous citizens, unimpeachable in their business, beautiful in their dailylives. You see their Masonry in their work and in their play. It appears in allthe forms of their activity, individual, domestic, social, ecclesiastical, orpolitical. True Masonry within must be morality without. It must becomeeminent morality, which is philanthropy. The true Mason loves not only hiskindred and his country, but all mankind; not onlythe good, but also the evil, among his brethren. He has more goodnessthan the channels of his daily life will hold. It runs over the banks, to waterand to feed a thousand thirsty plants. Not content with the duty that liesalong his track, he goes out to seek it; not only willing, he has a salientlonging to do good, to spread his truth, his justice, his generosity, hisMasonry over all the world. His daily life is a profession of his Masonry,published in perpetual good-will to men. He can not be a persecutor.Not more naturally does the beaver build or the mocking-bird sing his ownwild, gushing melody, than the true Mason lives in this beautiful outwardlife. So from the perennial spring swells forth the stream, to quicken themeadow with new access of green, and perfect beauty bursting intobloom. Thus Masonry does the work it was meant to do. The Mason doesnot sigh and weep, and make grimaces. He lives right on. If his life is, aswhose is not, marked with errors, and with sins, he ploughs over thebarren spot with his remorse, sows with new seed, and the old desertblossoms like a rose. He is not confined to set forms of thought, of action,or of feeling. He accepts what his mind regards as true, what hisconscience decides is right, what his heart deems generous and noble;and all else he puts far from him. Though the ancient and the honorable ofthe Earth bid him bow down to them, his stubborn knees bend only at thebidding of his manly soul. His Masonry is his freedom before God, not hisbondage unto men. His mind acts after the universal law of the intellect,his conscience according to the universal moral law, his affections and hissoul after the universal law of each, and so he is strong with the strengthof God, in this four-fold way communicating with Him.The old theologies, the philosophies of religion of ancient times, will notsuffice us now. The duties of life are to be done; we are to do them,consciously obedient to the law of God, not atheistically, loving only ourselfish gain. There are sins of trade to be corrected. Everywhere moralityand philanthropy are needed. There are errors to be made way with, andtheir place supplied with new truths, radiant with the glories of Heaven.There are great wrongs and evils, in Church and State, in domestic,social, and public life, to be righted and outgrown. Masonry cannot in ourage forsake the broad way of life. She must journey on in the open street,appear in the crowded square, and teach men by her deeds, her life moreeloquent than any lips.This Degree is chiefly devoted to TOLERATION; and it inculcates in thestrongest manner that great leading idea of the Ancient Art, that a belief inthe one True God, and a moral and virtuous life, constitute the onlyreligious requisites needed to enable a man to be a Mason.Masonry has ever the most vivid remembrance of the terrible and artificialtorments that were used to put down new forms of religion or extinguishthe old. It sees with the eye of memory the ruthless extermination of all thepeople of all sexes and ages, because it was their misfortune not to knowthe God of the Hebrews, or to worship Him under the wrong name, by thesavage troops of Moses and Joshua. It sees the thumb-screws and theracks, the whip, the gallows, and the stake, the victims of Diocletian andAlva, the miserable Covenanters, the Non-Conformists, Servetus burned,and the unoffending Quaker hung. It sees Cranmer hold his arm, now nolonger erring, in the flame until the hand drops off in the consuming heat. Itsees the persecutions of Peter and Paul, the martyrdom of Stephen, thetrials of Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin, and Irenæus; and then in turn thesufferings of the wretched Pagans under the Christian Emperors, as of thePapists in Ireland and under Elizabeth and the bloated Henry. The RomanVirgin naked before the hungry lions; young Margaret Graham tied to astake at low-water mark, and there left to drown, singing hymns to Goduntil the savage waters broke over her head; and all that in all ages havesuffered by hunger and nakedness, peril and prison, the rack, the stake,and the sword, - it sees them all, and shudders at the long roll of humanatrocities. And it sees also the oppression still practised in the name ofreligion - men shot in a Christian jail in Christian Italy for reading theChristian Bible; in almost every Christian State, laws forbidding freedom ofspeech on matters relating to Christianity; and the gallows reaching itsarm over the pulpit.The fires of Moloch in Syria, the harsh mutilations in the name of Astarte,Cybele, Jehovah; the barbarities of imperial Pagan Torturers; the stillgrosser torments which Roman-Gothic Christians in Italy and Spainheaped on their brother-men; the fiendish cruelties to which Switzerland,France, the Netherlands, England, Scotland, Ireland, America, have beenwitnesses, are none too powerful to warn man of the unspeakable evilswhich follow from mistakes and errors in the matter of religion, andespecially frominvesting the God of Love with the cruel and vindictive passions of erringhumanity, and making blood to have a sweet savor in his nostrils, andgroans of agony to be delicious to his ears.Man never had the right to usurp the unexercised prerogative of God, andcondemn and punish another for his belief. Born in a Protestant land, weare of that faith. If we had opened our eyes to the light under the shadowsof St. Peter's at Rome, we should have been devout Catholics; born in theJewish quarter of Aleppo, we should have contemned Christ as animposter; in Constantinople, we should have cried "Allah il Allah, God isgreat and Mahomet is his prophet!" Birth, place, and education give us ourfaith. Few believe in any religion because they have examined theevidences of its authenticity, and made up a formal judgment, uponweighing the testimony. Not one man in ten thousand knows anythingabout the proofs of his faith. We believe what we are taught; and those aremost fanatical who know least of the evidences on which their creed isbased. Facts and testimony are not, except in very rare instances, theground-work of faith. It is an imperative law of God's Economy, unyieldingand inflexible as Himself, that man shall accept without question the beliefof those among whom he is born and reared; the faith so made a part ofhis nature resists all evidence to the contrary; and he will disbelieve eventhe evidence of his own senses, rather than yield up the religious beliefwhich has grown up in him, flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone.What is truth to me is not truth to another. The same arguments andevidences that convince one mind make no impression on another. Thisdifference is in men at their birth. No man is entitled positively to assertthat he is right, where other men, equally intelligent and equally wellinformed,hold directly the opposite opinion. Each thinks it impossible forthe other 'to be sincere, and each, as to that, is equally in error. "What istruth?" was a profound question, the most suggestive one ever put to man.Many beliefs of former and present times seem incomprehensible. Theystartle us with a new glimpse into the human soul, that mysterious thingmore mysterious the more we note its workings. Here is a man superior tomyself in intellect and learning; and yet he sincerely believes what seemsto me too absurd to merit confutation; and I cannot conceive, andsincerely do not believe,that he is both sane and honest. And yet he is both. His reason is as perfect as mine, and he is as honest as I.The fancies of a lunatic are realities, to him. Our dreams are realities whilethey last; and, in the Past, no more unreal than what we have acted in ourwaking hours. No man can say that he hath as sure possession of thetruth as of a chattel. When men entertain opinions diametrically opposedto each other, and each is honest, who shall decide which hath the Truth;and how can either say with certainty that he hath it? We know not what isthe truth. That we ourselves believe and feel absolutely certain that ourown belief is true, is in reality not the slightest proof of the fact, seem itnever so certain and incapable of doubt to us. No man is responsible forthe rightness of his faith; but only for the uprightness of it.Therefore no man hath or ever had a right to persecute another for hisbelief; for there cannot be two antagonistic rights; and if one canpersecute another, because he himself is satisfied that the belief of thatother is erroneous, the other has, for the same reason, equally as certaina right to persecute him.The truth comes to us tinged and colored with our prejudices and ourpreconceptions, which are as old as ourselves, and strong with a divineforce. It comes to us as the image of a rod comes to us through the water,bent and distorted. An argument sinks into and convinces the mind of oneman, while from that of another it rebounds like a ball of ivory dropped onmarble. It is no merit in a man to have a particular faith, excellent andsound and philosophic as it may be, when he imbibed it with his mother'smilk. It is no more a merit than his prejudices and his passions.The sincere Moslem has as much right to persecute us, as we topersecute him; and therefore Masonry wisely requires no more than abelief in One Great All-Powerful Deity, the Father and Preserver of theUniverse. Therefore it is she teaches her votaries that toleration is one ofthe chief duties of every good Mason, a component part of that charitywithout which we are mere hollow images of true Masons, mere soundingbrass and tinkling cymbals.No evil hath so afflicted the world as intolerance of religious opinion. Thehuman beings it has slain in various ways, if once and together brought tolife, would make a nation of people; left to live and increase, would havedoubled the population of the civilized portion of the globe; among whichcivilized portion it chiefly is that religious wars are waged. The treasure and the human laborthus lost would have made the earth a garden, in which, but for his evilpassions, man might now be as happy as in Eden.No man truly obeys the Masonic law who merely tolerates those whosereligious opinions are opposed to his own. Every man's opinions are hisown private property, and the rights of all men to maintain each his ownare perfectly equal. Merely to tolerate, to bear with an opposing opinion, isto assume it to be heretical; and assert the right to persecute, if we would;and claim our toleration of it as a merit. The Mason's creed goes furtherthan that. No man, it holds, has any right in any way to, interfere with thereligious belief of another. It holds that each mat] is absolutely sovereignas to his own belief, and that belief is a matter absolutely foreign to all whodo not entertain the same belief; and that, if there were any right ofpersecution at all, it would in all cases be a mutual right; because oneparty has the same right as the other to sit as judge in his own case; andGod is the only magistrate that can rightfully decide between them. To1hat great judge, Masonry refers the matter; and opening wide its portals,it invites to enter there and live in peace and harmony, the Protestant, theCatholic, the Jew, the Moslem; every man who will lead a truly virtuousand moral life, love his brethren, sinister to the sick and distressed, andbelieve in the ONE, All Powerful, All-Wise, everywhere - Present GOD,Architect, Creator, and Preserver of all things, by whose universal law ofHarmony ever rolls on this universe, the great, vast, infinite circle ofsuccessive Death and Life:- to whose INEFFABLE NAME let all trueMasons pay profoundest homage! for whose thousand blessings pouredupon us, let us feel the sincerest gratitude, now, henceforth, and forever!We may well be tolerant of each other's creed; for in every faith there areexcellent moral precepts. Far in the South of Asia, Zoroaster taught thisdoctrine: "On commencing a journey, the Faithful should turn his thoughtstoward Ormuzd, and confess him, in the purity of his heart, to be King ofthe World; he should love him, do him homage, and serve him. He mustbe upright and charitable, despise the pleasures of the body, and avoidpride and haughtiness, and vice in all its forms, and especially 'falsehood,one of the basest sins of which man can be guilty. He must forget injuries and not avenge himself. He must honor the memory ofhis parents and relatives. At night, before retiring to sleep, he shouldrigorously examine his conscience, and repent of the faults whichweakness or ill-fortune had caused him to commit." He was required topray for strength to persevere in the Good, and to obtain forgiveness forhis errors. It was his duty to confess his faults to a Magus, or to a laymanrenowned for his virtues, or to the Sun. Fasting and maceration wereprohibited; and, on the contrary, it was his duty suitably to nourish thebody and to maintain its vigor, that his soul might be strong to resist theGenius of Darkness; that he might more attentively read the Divine Word,and have more courage to perform noble deeds.And in the North of Europe the Druids taught devotion to friends,indulgence for reciprocal wrongs, love of deserved praise, prudence,humanity, hospitality, respect for old age, disregard of the future,temperance, contempt of death, and a chivalrous deference to woman.Listen to these maxims from the Hava Maal, or Sublime Book of Odin:"If thou hast a friend, visit him often; the path will grow over with grass,and the trees soon cover it, if thou dost not constantly walk upon it. He is afaithful friend, who, having but two loaves, gives his friend one. Be neverfirst to break with thy friend; sorrow wrings the heart of him who has noone save himself with whom to take counsel. There is no virtuous manwho has not some vice, no bad man who has not some virtue. Happy hewho obtains the praise and good-will of men; for all that depends on thewill of another is hazardous and uncertain. Riches flit away in the twinklingof an eye; they are the most inconstant of friends; flocks and herds perish,parents die, friends are not immortal, thou thyself diest; I know but onething that doth not die, the judgment that is passed upon the dead. Behumane toward those whom thou meetest on the road. If the guest thatcometh to thy house is a - cold, give him fire; the man who has journeyedover the mountains needs food and dry garments. Mock not at the aged;for words full of sense come often from the wrinkles of age. Be moderatelywise, and not over-prudent. Let no one seek to know his destiny, if hewould sleep tranquilly. There is no malady more cruel than to bediscontented with our lot. The glutton eats his own death; and the wiseman laughs at the fool's greediness. Nothing is more injurious to theyoung than excessive drinking; the more one drinks the more he loses his reason; thebird of forgetfulness sings before those who intoxicate themselves, andwiles away their souls. Man devoid of sense believes he will live always ifhe avoids war; but, if the lances spare him, old age will give him noquarter. Better live well than live long. When a man lights a fire in hishouse, death comes before it goes out."And thus said the Indian books: "Honor thy father and mother. Neverforget the benefits thou hast received. Learn while thou art young. Besubmissive to the laws of thy country. . Seek the company of virtuousmen. Speak not of God but with respect. Live on good terms with thyfellow-citizens. Remain in thy proper place. Speak ill of no one. Mock atthe bodily infirmities of none. Pursue not unrelentingly a conqueredenemy. Strive to acquire a good reputation. Take counsel with wise men.The more one learns, the more he acquires the faculty of learning,Knowledge is the most permanent wealth. As well be dumb as ignorant.The true use of knowledge is to distinguish good from evil. Be not asubject of shame to thy parents. What one learns in youth endures like theengraving upon a rock. He is wise who knows himself. Let thy books bethy best friends. When thou attainest an hundred years, cease to learn.Wisdom is solidly planted, even on the shifting ocean. Deceive no one, noteven thine enemy. Wisdom is a treasure that everywhere commands itsvalue. Speak mildly, even to the poor. It is sweeter to forgive than to takevengeance. Gaming and quarrels lead to misery. There is no true meritwithout the practice of virtue. To honor our mother is the most fittinghomage we can pay the Divinity. There is no tranquil sleep without a clearconscience. He badly understands his interest who breaks his word."Twenty-four centuries ago these were the Chinese Ethics:"The Philosopher [Confucius] said, 'SAN! my doctrine is simple, and easyto be understood.' THSENG-TSEU replied, 'that is certain.' ThePhilosopher having gone out, the disciples asked what their master hadmeant to say. THSENG--TSEU responded, 'The doctrine of our Masterconsists solely in being upright of heart, and loving our neighbor as welove ourself."'About a century later, the Hebrew law said, "If any man hate his neighbor... then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought todo unto his brother . . . Better is a neighbor that is near, than a. brotherafar off ... Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."In the same fifth century before Christ, SOCRATES the Grecian said,"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."Three generations earlier, ZOROASTER had said to the Persians: "Offerup thy grateful prayers to the Lord, the most just and pure Ormuzd, thesupreme and adorable God, who thus declared to his Prophet Zerdusht:'Hold it not meet to do unto others what thou wouldst not desire done untothyself; do that unto the people, which, when done to thyself, is notdisagreeable unto thee."'The same doctrine had been long taught in the schools of Babylon,Alexandria, and Jerusalem. A Pagan declared to the Pharisee HILLEL thathe was ready to embrace the Jewish religion, if he could make known tohim in a few words a summary of the whole law of Moses. "That whichthou likest not done to thyself," said Hillel, "do it not unto thy neighbor.Therein is all the law: the rest is nothing but the commentary upon it.""Nothing is more natural," said CONFUCIUS, "nothing more simple, thanthe principles of that morality which I endeavor, by salutary maxims, toinculcate in you . . . It is humanity; which is to say, that universal charityamong all of our species, without distinction. It is uprightness ; that is, thatrectitude of spirit and of heart, which make; one seek for truth ineverything, and desire it, without deceiving one's self or others. It is,finally, sincerity or good faith; which is to say, that frankness, thatopenness of heart, tempered by self-reliance, which excludes all feintsand all disguising, as much in speech as in action."To diffuse useful information, to further intellectual refinement, sureforerunner of moral improvement, to hasten the coming of the great day,when the dawn of general knowledge shalt ,chase away the lazy, lingeringmists of ignorance and error, even from the base of the great socialpyramid, is indeed a high calling, in which the most splendid talents andconsummate virtue may well press onward, eager to bear a part. From theMasonic ranks ought to go forth those whose genius and not theirancestry ennoble them, to open to all ranks the temple of science, and bytheir own example to make the humblest men emulous to climb steps nolonger inaccessible, and enter the unfolded gates burning in the sun.The highest intellectual cultivation is perfectly compatible withthe daily cares and toils of working-men. A keen relish for the mostsublime truths of science belongs alike to every class of Mankind. And, asphilosophy was taught in the sacred groves of Athens, and under thePortico, and in the old Temples of Egypt and India, so in our Lodges oughtKnowledge to be dispensed, the Sciences taught, and the Lecturesbecome like the teachings of Socrates and Plato, of Agassiz and Cousin.Real knowledge never permitted either turbulence or unbelief; but itsprogress is the forerunner of liberality and enlightened toleration. Whosodreads these may well tremble; for he may be well assured that their dayis at length come, and must put to speedy flight the evil spirits of tyrannyand persecution, which haunted the long night now gone down the sky.And it is to be hoped that the time will soon arrive, when, as men will nolonger suffer themselves to be led blindfolded in ignorance, so will they nomore yield to the vile principle of judging and treating their fellowcreatures,not according to the intrinsic merit of their actions, butaccording to the accidental and involuntary coincidence of their opinions.Whenever we come to treat with entire respect those who conscientiouslydiffer from ourselves, the only practical effect of a difference will be, tomake us enlighten the ignorance on one side or the other, from which itsprings, by instructing them, if it be theirs; ourselves, if it be our own; tothe end that the only kind of unanimity may be produced which isdesirable among rational beings, - the agreement proceeding from fullconviction after the freest discussion.The Elu of Fifteen ought therefore to take the lead of his fellow-citizen, notin frivolous amusements, not in the degrading pursuits of the ambitiousvulgar; but in the truly noble task of enlightening the mass of hiscountrymen, and of leaving his own name encircled, not with barbaricsplendor, or attached to courtly gewgaws, but illustrated by the honorsmost worthy of our rational nature; coupled with the diffusion ofknowledge, and gratefully pronounced by a few, at least, whom his wisebeneficence has rescued from ignorance and vice.We say to him, in the words of the great Roman: "Men in no respect sonearly approach to the Deity, as when they confer benefits on men. Toserve and do good to as many as possible, - there is nothing greater inyour fortune than that you should be able,and nothing finer in your nature, than that you should be desirous to dothis." This is the true mark for the aim of every man and Mason who eitherprizes the enjoyment of pure happiness, or sets a right value upon a highand unsullied renown. And if the benefactors of mankind, when they restfrom their noble labors, shall be permitted to enjoy hereafter, as anappropriate reward of their virtue, the privilege of looking down upon theblessings with which their exertions and charities, and perhaps their toilsand sufferings have clothed the scene of their former existence, it will not,in a state of exalted purity and wisdom, be the founders of mightydynasties, the conquerors of new empires, the Cæsars, Alexanders, andTamerlanes; nor the mere Kings and Counsellors, Presidents andSenators, who have lived for their party chiefly, and for their country onlyincidentally, often sacrificing to their own aggrandizement or that of theirfaction the good of their fellow-creatures; - it will not be they who will begratified by contemplating the monuments of their inglorious fame; butthose will enjoy that delight and march in that triumph, who can trace theremote effects of their enlightened benevolence in the improved conditionof their species, and exult in the reflection, that the change which they atlast, perhaps after many years, survey, with eyes that age and sorrow canmake dim no more, - of Knowledge become Power, - Virtue sharing thatEmpire, - Superstition dethroned, and Tyranny exiled, is, if even only insome small and very slight degree, yet still in some degree, the fruit,precious if costly, and though late repaid yet long enduring, of their ownself-denial and strenuous exertion, of their own mite of charity and aid toeducation wisely bestowed, and of the hardships and hazards which theyencountered here below.Masonry requires of its Initiates and votaries nothing that is impracticable.It does not demand that they should undertake to climb to those lofty andsublime peaks of a theoretical and imaginary unpractical virtue, high andcold and remote as the eternal snows that wrap the shoulders ofChimborazo, and at least as inaccessible as they. It asks that alone to bedone which is easy to be done. It overtasks no one's strength, and asks noone to go beyond his means and capacities. It does not expect one whosebusiness or profession yields him little more than the wants of himself andhis family require, and whose time is necessarily occupied by his dailyvocations, to abandon or neglect the businessby which he and his children live, and devote himself and his means to thediffusion of knowledge among men. It does not expect him to publishbooks for the people, or to lecture, to the ruin of his private affairs, or tofound academies and colleges, build up libraries, and entitle himself tostatues.But it does require and expect every man of us to do something, withinand according to his means; and there is no Mason who cannot do something, if not alone, then by combination and association.If a Lodge cannot aid in founding a school or an academy it can still dosomething. It can educate one boy or girl, at least, the child of some pooror departed brother. And it should never be forgotten, that in the poorestunregarded child that seems abandoned to ignorance and vice mayslumber the virtues of a Socrates, the intellect of a Bacon or a Bossuet,the genius of a Shakespeare, the capacity to benefit mankind of aWashington; and that in rescuing him from the mire in which he isplunged, and giving him the means of education and development, theLodge that does it may be the direct and immediate means of conferringupon the world as great a boon as that given it by John Faust the boy ofMentz; may perpetuate the liberties of a country and change the destiniesof nations, and write a new chapter in the history of the world.For we never know the importance of the act we do. The daughter ofPharaoh little thought what she was doing for the human race, and thevast unimaginable consequences that depended on her charitable act,when she drew the little child of a Hebrew woman from among the rushesthat grew along the bank of the Nile, and determined to rear it as if it wereher own.How often has an act of charity, costing the doer little, given to the world agreat painter, a great musician, a great inventor! How often has such anact developed the ragged boy into the benefactor of his race! On whatsmall and apparently unimportant circumstances have turned and hinged,the fates of the world's great conquerors. There is no law that limits thereturns that shall be reaped from a single good deed. The widow's mitemay not only be as acceptable to God, but may produce as great resultsas the rich man's costly offering. The poorest boy, helped by benevolence,may come to lead armies, to control senates, to decide an peace and war,to dictate to cabinets; and his magnificent thoughts and noble words may be law many years hereafter to millions of men yet unborn.But the opportunity to effect a great good does not often occur to any one.It is worse than folly for one to lie idle and inert, and expect the accident tobefall him, by which his influences shall live forever. He can expect that tohappen, only in consequence of one or many or all of a long series of acts.He can expect to benefit the world only as men attain other results; bycontinuance, by persistence, by a steady and uniform habit of laboring forthe enlightenment of the world, to the extent of his means and capacity.For it is, in all instances, by steady labor, by giving enough of applicationto our work, and having enough of time for the doing of it, by regularpains-taking, and the plying of constant assiduities, and not by anyprocess of legerdemain, that we secure the strength and the staple of realexcellence. It was thus that Demosthenes, clause after clause, andsentence after sentence, elaborated to the uttermost his immortal orations.It was thus that Newton pioneered his way, by the steps of an ascendinggeometry, to the mechanism of the Heavens, and Le Verrier added aplanet to our Solar System.It is a most erroneous opinion that those who have left the moststupendous monuments of intellect behind them, were not differentlyexercised from the rest of the species, but only differently gifted; that theysignalized themselves only by their talent, and hardly ever by theirindustry; for it is in truth to the most strenuous application of thosecommonplace faculties which are diffused among all, that they areindebted for the glories which now encircle their remembrance and theirname.We must not imagine it to be a vulgarizing of genius, that it should belighted up in any other way than by a direct inspiration from Heaven noroverlook the steadfastness of purpose, the devotion to some single butgreat object, the unweariedness of labor that is given, not in convulsiveand preternatural throes, but by little and little as the strength of the mindmay bear it; the accumulation of many small efforts, instead of a few grandand gigantic, but perhaps irregular movements, on the part of energiesthat are marvellous; by which former alone the great results are broughtout that write their enduring records on the face of the earth and in thehistory of nations and of man.We must not overlook these elements, to which genius owes the best andproudest of her achievements; nor imagine that qualities so generallypossessed as patience and pains-taking, and resolute industry, have noshare in upholding a distinction so illustrious as that of the benefactor ofhis kind.We must not forget that great results are most ordinarily produced by anaggregate of many contributions and exertions; as it is the invisibleparticles of vapor, each separate and distinct from the other, that, risingfrom the oceans and their bays and gulfs, from lakes and rivers, and widemorasses and overflowed plains, float away as clouds, and distill upon theearth in dews, and fall in showers and rain and snows upon the broadplains and rude mountains, and make the great navigable streams that arethe arteries along which flows the life-blood of a country.And so Masonry can do much, if each Mason be content to do his share,and if their united efforts are directed by wise counsels to a commonpurpose. "It is for God and for Omnipotency to do mighty things in amoment; but by degrees to grow to greatness is the course that He hathleft for man."If Masonry will but be true to her mission, and Masons to their promisesand obligations - if, re-entering vigorously upon a career of beneficence,she and they will but pursue it earnestly and unfalteringly, rememberingthat our contributions to the cause of charity and education then deservethe greatest credit when it costs us something, the curtailing of a comfortor the relinquishment of a luxury, to make them - if we will but give aid towhat were once Masonry's great schemes for human improvement, notfitfully and spasmodically, but regularly and incessantly, as the vapors riseand the springs run, and as the sun rises and the stars come up into theheavens, then we may be sure that great results will be attained and agreat work done. And then it will most surely be seen that Masonry is noteffete or impotent, nor degenerated nor drooping to a fatal decay.
XI. SUBLIME ELECT OF THE TWELVEORPRINCE AMETH.[Elu of the Twelve.]The duties of a Prince Ameth are, to be earnest, true, reliable, andsincere; to protect the people against illegal impositions and exactions; tocontend for their political rights, and to see, as far as he may or can, thatthose bear the burdens who reap the benefits of the Government.You are to be true unto all men.You are to be frank and sincere in all things.You are to be earnest in doing whatever it is your duty to do.And no man must repent that he has relied upon your resolve, yourprofession, or your word.The great distinguishing characteristic of a Mason is sympathy with hiskind. He recognizes in the human race one great family, all connectedwith himself by those invisible links, and that mighty net-work ofcircumstance, forged and woven by God.Feeling that sympathy, it is his first Masonic duty to serve his fellow-man.At his first entrance into the Order, he ceases to be isolated, andbecomes one of a great brotherhood, assuming now duties toward everyMason that lives, as every Mason at the same moment assumes themtoward him.Nor are those duties on his part confined to Masons alone. He assumesmany in regard to his country, and especially toward the great, sufferingmasses of the common people; for they too are his brethren, and Godhears them, inarticulate as the moanings of their misery are. By all propermeans, of persuasion and influence, and otherwise, if the occasion and emergency require, he is bound to defend them against oppression, and tyrannical and illegal exactions.He labors equally to defend and to improve the people. He does notflatter them to mislead them, nor fawn upon them to rule them, norconceal his opinions to humor them, nor tell them that they can never err,and that their voice is the voice of God. He knows that the safety of everyfree government, and its continuance and perpetuity depend upon thevirtue and intelligence of the common people; and that, unless their libertyis of such a kind as arms can neither procure nor take away; unless it isthe fruit of manly courage, of justice, temperance, and generous virtue -unless, being such, it has taken deep root in the minds and hearts of thepeople at large, there will not long be wanting those who will snatch fromthem by treachery what they have acquired by arms or institutions.He knows that if, after being released from the toils of war, the peopleneglect the arts of peace; if their peace and liberty be a state of warfare; ifwar be their only virtue, and the summit of their praise, they will soon findpeace the most adverse to their interests. It will be only a moredistressing war; and that which they imagined liberty will be the worst ofslavery. For, unless by the means of knowledge and morality, not frothyand loquacious, but genuine, unadulterated, and sincere, they clear thehorizon of the mind from those mists of error and passion which arise fromignorance and vice, they will always have those who will bend their necksto the yoke as if they were brutes; who, notwithstanding all their triumphs,will put them up to the highest bidder, as if they were mere booty made inwar; and find an exuberant source of wealth and power, in the people'signorance, prejudice, and passions.The people that does not subjugate the propensity of the wealthy toavarice, ambition, and sensuality, expel luxury from them and theirfamilies, keep down pauperism, diffuse knowledge among the poor, andlabor to raise the abject from the mire of vice and low indulgence, and tokeep the industrious from starving in sight of luxurious festivals, will findthat it has cherished, in that avarice, ambition, sensuality, selfishness,and luxury of the one class, and that degradation, misery, drunkenness,ignorance, and brutalization of the other, more stubborn and intractabledespots at home than it ever encountered in the field; and even its very bowels will be continually teeming with the intolerable progeny of tyrants.These are the first enemies to be subdued; this constitutes the campaignof Peace; these are triumphs, difficult indeed, but bloodless; and far morehonorable than those trophies which are purchased only by slaughter andrapine; and if not victors in this service, it is in vain to have beenvictorious over the despotic enemy in the field.For if any people thinks that it is a grander; a more beneficial, or a wiserpolicy, to invent subtle expedients by stamps and imposts, for increasingthe revenue and draining the life-blood of an impoverished people; tomultiply its naval and military force; to rival in craft the ambassadors offoreign states; to plot the swallowing up of foreign territory; to make craftytreaties and alliances; to rule prostrate states and abject provinces by fearand force; than to administer unpolluted justice to the people, to relievethe condition and raise the estate of the toiling masses, redress theinjured and succor the distressed and conciliate the discontented, andspeedily restore to every one his own; then that people is involved in acloud of error, and will too late perceive, when the illusion of these mightybenefits has vanished, that in neglecting these, which it thought inferiorconsiderations, it has only been precipitating its own ruin and despair.Unfortunately, every age presents its own special problem, most difficultand often impossible to solve; and that which this age offers, and forcesupon the consideration of all chinking men, is this - how, in a populousand wealthy country, blessed with free institutions and a constitutionalgovernment, are the great masses of the manual-labor class to beenabled to have steady work at fair wages, to be kept from starvation, andtheir children from vice and debauchery, and to be furnished with thatdegree, not of mere reading and writing, but of knowledge, that shall fitthem intelligently to do the duties and exercise the privileges of freemen;even to be intrusted with the dangerous right of suffrage?For though we do not know why God, being infinitely merciful as well aswise, has so ordered it, it seems to be unquestionably his law, that evenin civilized and Christian countries, the large mass of the population shallbe fortunate, if, during their whole life, from infancy to old age, in healthand sickness, they have enough of the commonest and coarsest food tokeep themselves and theirchildren from the continual gnawing of hunger - enough of the commonestand coarsest clothing to protect themselves and their little ones fromindecent exposure and the bitter cold; and if they have over their headsthe rudest shelter.And He seems to have enacted this law - which no human community hasyet found the means to abrogate - that when a country becomespopulous, capital shall concentrate in the hands of a limited number ofpersons, and labor become more and more at its mercy, until meremanual labor, that of the weaver and ironworker, and other artisans,eventually ceases to be worth more than a bare subsistence, and often, ingreat cities and vast extents of country not even that, and goes or crawlsabout in rags, begging, and starving for want of work.While every ox and horse can find work, and is worth being fed, it is notalways so with man. To be employed, to have a chance to work atanything like fair wages, becomes the great engrossing object of a man'slife. The capitalist can live without employing the laborer, and dischargeshim whenever that labor ceases to be profitable. At the moment when theweather is most inclement, provisions dearest, and rents highest, he turnshim off to starve. If the day-laborer is taken sick, his wages stop. Whenold, he has no pension to retire upon. His children cannot be sent toschool; for before their bones are hardened they must get to work lestthey starve. The man, strong and able-bodied, works for a shilling or twoa day, and the woman shivering over her little pan of coals, when themercury drops far below zero, after her hungry children have wailedthemselves to sleep, sews by the dim light of her lonely candle, for a barepittance, selling her life to him who bargained only for the work of herneedle.Fathers and mothers slay their children, to have the burial-fees, that withthe price of one child's life they may continue life in those that survive.Little girls with bare feet sweep the street-crossings, when the winter windpinches them, and beg piteously for pennies of those who wear warmfurs. Children grow up in squalid misery and brutal ignorance; wantcompels virgin and wife to prostitute themselves; women starve andfreeze, and lean up against the walls of workhouses, like bundles of foulrags, all night long, and night after night, when the cold rain falls, andthere chances to be no room for them within; and hundreds of families arecrowded into a single building, rife with horrors and teemingwith foul air and pestilence; where men, women and children huddle togetherin their filth; all ages and all colors sleeping indiscriminately together; while, ina great, free, Republican State, in the full vigor of its youth and strength, oneperson in every seventeen is a pauper receiving charity.How to deal with this apparently inevitable evil and mortal disease is by far themost important of all social problems. What is to be done with pauperism andover-supply of labor? How is the life of any country to last, when brutality anddrunken semi-barbarism vote, and hold offices in their gift, and by fitrepresentatives of themselves control a government? How, if not wisdom andauthority, but turbulence and low vice are to exalt to senatorships miscreantsreeking with the odors and pollution of the hell, the prize-ring, the brothel, andthe stock-exchange, where gambling is legalized and rascality is laudable?Masonry will do all in its power, by direct exertion and cooperation, to improveand inform as well as to protect the people; to better their physical condition,relieve their miseries, supply their wants, and minister to their necessities. Letevery Mason in this good work do all that may be in his power.For it is true now, as it always was and always will be, that to be free is thesame thing as to be pious, to be wise, to be temperate and just, to be frugaland abstinent, and to be magnanimous and brave; and to be the opposite of allthese is the same as to be a slave. And it usually happens, by theappointment, and, as it were, retributive justice of the Deity, that that peoplewhich cannot govern themselves, and moderate their passions, but crouchunder the slavery of their lusts and vices, are delivered up to the sway of thosewhom they abhor, and made to submit to an involuntary servitude.And it is also sanctioned by the dictates of justice and by the constitution ofNature, that he who, from the imbecility or derangement of his intellect, isincapable of governing himself, should, like a minor, be committed to thegovernment of another.Above all things let us never forget that mankind constitutes one greatbrotherhood; all born to encounter suffering and sorrow, and therefore boundto sympathize with each other.For no tower of Pride was ever yet high enough to lift its possessor above thetrials and fears and frailities of humanity. No human hand ever built the wall,nor ever shall, that will keep outaffliction, pain, and infirmity. Sickness and sorrow, trouble and death, aredispensations that level everything. They know none, high nor low. Thechief wants of life, the great and grave necessities of the human soul, giveexemption to none. They make all poor, all weak. They put supplication inthe mouth of every human being, as truly as in that of the meanestbeggar.But the principle of misery is not an evil principle. We err, and theconsequences teach us wisdom. All elements, all the laws of thingsaround us, minister to this end; and through the paths of painful error andmistake, it is the design of Providence to lead us to truth and happiness. Iferring only taught us to err; if mistakes confirmed us in imprudence; if themiseries caused by vicious indulgence had a natural tendency to make usmore abject slaves of vice, then suffering would be wholly evil. But, on thecontrary, all tends and is designed to produce amendment andimprovement. Suffering is the discipline of virtue; of that which is infinitelybetter than happiness, and yet embraces in itself all essential happiness.It nourishes, invigorates, and perfects it. Virtue is the prize of theseverely-contested race and hard-fought battle; and it is worth all thefatigue and wounds of the conflict. Man should go forth with a brave andstrong heart, to battle with calamity. He is to master it, and not let itbecome his master. He is not to forsake the post of trial and of peril; but tostand firmly in his lot, until the great word of Providence shall bid him fly,or bid him sink. With resolution and courage the Mason is to do the workwhich it is appointed for him to do, looking through the dark cloud ofhuman calamity, to the end that rises high and bright before him. The lotof sorrow is great and sublime. None suffer forever, nor for nought, norwithout purpose. It is the ordinance of God's wisdom, and of His InfiniteLove, to procure for us infinite happiness and glory.Virtue is the truest liberty; nor is he free who stoops to passions; nor he inbondage who serves a noble master. Examples are the best and mostlasting lectures; virtue the best example. He that hath done good deedsand set good precedents, in sincerity, is happy. Time shall not outlive hisworth. He lives truly after death, whose good deeds are his pillars ofremembrance; and no day but adds some grains to his heap of glory.Good works are seeds, that after sowing return us a continual harvest;and the memory of noble actions is more enduring than monuments ofmarble.Life is a school. The world is neither prison nor penitentiary, nor a palaceof ease, nor an amphitheatre for games and spectacles; but a place ofinstruction, and discipline. Life is given for moral and spiritual training;and the entire course of the great school of life is an education for virtue,happiness, and a future existence. The periods of Life are its terms; allhuman conditions, its forms; all human employments, its lessons. Familiesare the primary departments of this moral education; the various circles ofsociety, its advanced stages; Kingdoms and Republics, its universities.Riches and Poverty, Gayeties and Sorrows, Marriages and Funerals, theties of life bound or broken, fit and fortunate, or untoward and painful, areall lessons. Events are not blindly and carelessly flung together.Providence does not school one man, and screen another from the fierytrial of its lessons. It has neither rich favorites nor poor victims. One eventhappeneth to all. One end and one design concern and urge all men.The prosperous man has been at school. Perhaps he has thought that itwas a great thing, and he a great personage; but he has been merely apupil. He thought, perhaps, that he was Master, and had nothing to do,but to direct and command; but there was ever a Master above him, theMaster of Life. He looks not at our splendid state, or our manypretensions, nor at the aids and appliances of our learning; but at ourlearning itself. He puts the poor and the rich upon the same form; andknows no difference between them, but their progress.If from prosperity we have learned moderation, temperance, candor,modesty, gratitude to God, and generosity to man, then we are entitled tobe honored and rewarded. If we have learned selfishness, selfindulgence,wrong-doing, and vice, to forget and overlook our lessfortunate brother, and to scoff at the providence of God, then we areunworthy and dishonored, though we have been nursed in affluence, ortaken our degrees from the lineage of an hundred noble descents; as trulyso, in the eye of Heaven, and of all right-thinking men, as though we lay,victims of beggary and disease, in the hospital, by the hedge, or on thedung-hill. The most ordinary human equity looks not at the school, but atthe scholar; and the equity of Heaven will not look beneath that mark.The poor man also is at school. Let him take care that helearn, rather than complain. Let him hold to his integrity, his candor, andhis kindness of heart. Let him beware of envy, and of bondage, and keephis self-respect. The body's toil is nothing. Let him beware of the mind'sdrudgery and degradation. While he betters his condition if he can, lethim be more anxious to better his soul. Let him be willing, while poor, andeven if always poor, to learn poverty's great lessons, fortitude,cheerfulness, contentment, and implicit confidence in God's Providence.With these, and patience, calmness, self-command, disinterestedness,and affectionate kindness, the humble dwelling may be hallowed, andmade more dear and noble than the loftiest palace. Let him, above allthings, see that he lose not his independence. Let him not cast himself, acreature poorer than the poor, an indolent, helpless, despised beggar, oftthe kindness of others. Every man should choose to have God for hisMaster, rather than man; and escape not from this school, either bydishonesty or alms-taking, lest he fall into that state, worse than disgrace,where he can have no respect for himself.The ties of Society teach us to love one another. That is a miserablesociety, where the absence of affectionate kindness is sought to besupplied by punctilious decorum, graceful urbanity, and polishedinsincerity; where ambition, jealousy, and distrust rule, in place ofsimplicity, confidence, and kindness.So, too, the social state teaches modesty and gentleness; and fromneglect, and notice unworthily bestowed on others, and injustice, and theworld's failure to appreciate us, we learn patience and quietness, to besuperior to society's opinion, not cynical and bitter, but gentle, candid,and affectionate still.Death is the great Teacher, stern, cold, inexorable, irresistible; whom thecollected might of the world cannot stay or ward off. The breath, thatparting from the lips of King or beggar, scarcely stirs the hushed air,cannot be bought, or brought back for a moment, with the wealth ofEmpires. What a lesson is this, teaching our frailty and feebleness, andan Infinite Power beyond us! It is a fearful lesson, that never becomesfamiliar. It walks through the earth in dread mystery, and lays it handsupon all. It is a universal lesson, that is read everywhere and by all men.Its message comes every year and every day. The past years arecrowded with its sad and solemn mementoes; and death's finger traces itshandwriting upon the walls of every human habitation.It teaches us Duty; to act our part well; to fulfill the work assigned us.When one is dying, and after he is dead, there is but one question: Hashe lived well? There is no evil in death but that which life makes.There are hard lessons in the school of God's Providence; and yet theschool of life is carefully adjusted, in all its arrangements and tasks, toman's powers and passions. There is no extravagance in its teachings;nor is anything done for 'the sake of present effect. The whole course ofhuman life is a conflict with difficulties; and, if rightly conducted, aprogress in improvement. It is never too late for man to learn. Not partonly, but the whole, of life is a school. There never comes a time, evenamidst the decays of age, when it is fit to lay aside the eagerness ofacquisition, or the cheerfulness of endeavor. Man walks, all through thecourse of life, in patience and strife, and sometimes in darkness; for, frompatience is to come perfection; from strife, triumph is to issue; from thecloud of darkness the lightning is to flash that shall open the way toeternity.Let the Mason be faithful in the school of life, and to all its lessons! Lethim not learn nothing, nor care not whether he learns or not. Let not theyears pass over him, witnesses of only his sloth and indifference; or seehim zealous to acquire everything but virtue. Nor let him labor only forhimself; nor forget that the humblest man that lives is his brother, andhath a claim on his sympathies and kind offices; and that beneath therough garments which labor wears may beat hearts as noble as throbunder the stars of princes.God, who counts by souls, not stations,Loves and pities you and me;For to Him all vain distinctionsAre as pebbles on the sea.Nor are the other duties inculcated in this Degree of less importance.Truth, a Mason is early told, is a Divine attribute and the foundation ofevery virtue; and frankness, reliability, sincerity, straightforwardness,plain-dealing, are but different modes in which Truth develops itself. Thedead, the absent, the innocent, and those that trust him, no Mason willdeceive willingly. To all these he owes a nobler justice, in that they arethe most certain trials of human Equity. Only the most abandoned of men,said Cicero, will deceive him, who would have remained uninjured if he had nottrusted. All the noble deeds that have beat their marches throughsucceeding ages have proceeded from men of truth and genuine courage.The man who is always true is both virtuous and wise; and thus possessesthe greatest guards of safety: for the law has not power to strike thevirtuous; nor can fortune subvert the wise.The bases of Masonry being morality and virtue, it is by studying one andpractising the other, that the conduct of a Mason becomes irreproachable.The good of Humanity being its principal object, disinterestedness is one ofthe first virtues that it requires of its members; for that is the source ofjustice and beneficence.To pity the misfortunes of others; to be humble, but without meanness; tobe proud, but without arrogance; to abjure every sentiment of hatred andrevenge; to show himself magnanimous and liberal, without ostentation andwithout profusion; to be the enemy of vice; to pay homage to wisdom andvirtue; to respect innocence; to be constant and patient in adversity, andmodest in prosperity; to avoid every irregularity that stains the soul anddistempers the body - it is by following these precepts that a Mason willbecome a good citizen, a faithful husband, a tender father, an obedient son,and a true brother; will honor friendship, and fulfill with ardor the dutieswhich virtue and the social relations impose upon him.It is because Masonry imposes upon us these duties that it is properly andsignificantly styled work; and he who imagines that he becomes a Mason bymerely taking the first two or three Degrees, and that he may, havingleisurely stepped upon that small elevation, thenceforward worthily wearthe honors of Masonry, without labor or exertion, or self-denial or sacrifice,and that there is nothing to be done in Masonry, is strangely deceived.Is it true that nothing remains to be done in Masonry?Does one Brother no longer proceed by law against another Brother of hisLodge, in regard to matters that could be easily settled within the Masonicfamily circle?Has the duel, that hideous heritage of barbarism, interdicted amongBrethren by our fundamental laws, and denounced by the municipal code,yet disappeared from the soil we inhabit? Do Masons of high rankreligiously refrain from it; or do they not,bowing to a corrupt public opinion, submit to its arbitrament, despite thescandal which it occasions to the Order, and in violation of the feeblerestraint of their oath?Do Masons no longer form uncharitable opinions of their Brethren, enterharsh judgments against them, and judge themselves by one rule and theirBrethren by another?Has Masonry any well-regulated system of charity? Has it done that which itshould have done for the cause of education? Where are its schools, itsacademies, its colleges, its hospitals, and infirmaries?Are political controversies now conducted with no violence and bitterness?Do Masons refrain from defaming and denouncing their Brethren who differwith them in religious or political opinions?What grand social problems or useful projects engage our attention at ourcommunications? Where in our Lodges are lectures habitually delivered forthe real instruction of the Brethren? Do not our sessions pass in thediscussion of minor matters of business, the settlement of points of orderand questions of mere administration, and the admission and advancementof Candidates, whom after their admission we take no pains to instruct?In what Lodge are our ceremonies explained and elucidated; corrupted asthey are by time, until their true features can scarcely be distinguished; andwhere are those great primitive truths of revelation taught, which Masonryhas preserved to the world?We have high dignities and sounding titles. Do their possessors qualifythemselves to enlighten the world in respect to the aims and objects ofMasonry? Descendants of those Initiates who governed empires, does yourinfluence enter into practical life and operate efficiently in behalf of wellregulatedand constitutional liberty?Your debates should be but friendly conversations. You need concord,union, and peace. Why then do you retain among you men who exciterivalries and jealousies; why permit great and violent controversy andambitious pretensions'? Now do your own words and acts agree? If yourMasonry is a nullity, how can you exercise any influence on others?Continually you praise each other, and utter elaborate and highwrought eulogies upon the Order. Everywhere you assume that you arewhat you should be, and nowhere do you look upon yourselves as youare. Is it true that all our actions are so many acts of homage to virtue?Explore the recesses of your hearts; let us examine ourselves with animpartial eye, and make answer to our own questioning! Can we bear toourselves the consoling testimony that we always rigidly perform ourduties; that we even half perform them?Let us away with this odious self-flattery! Let us be men, if we cannot besages! The laws of Masonry, above others excellent, cannot whollychange men's natures. They enlighten them, they point out the true way;but they can lead them in it, only by repressing the fire of their passions,and subjugating their selfishness. Alas, these conquer, and Masonry isforgotten!After praising each other all our lives, there are always excellent Brethren,who, over our coffins, shower unlimited eulogies. Every one of us whodies, however useless his life, has been a model of all the virtues, a verychild of the celestial light. In Egypt, among our old Masters, whereMasonry was more cultivated than vanity, no one could gain admittance tothe sacred asylum of the tomb until he had passed under the most solemnjudgment. A grave tribunal sat in judgment upon all, even the kings. Theysaid to the dead, "Whoever thou art, give account to thy country of thyactions! What hast thou done with thy time and life? The law interrogatesthee, thy country hears thee, Truth sits in judgment on thee!" Princescame there to be judged, escorted only by their virtues and their vices. Apublic accuser recounted the history of the dead man's life, and threw theblaze of the torch of truth on all his actions. If it were adjudged that hehad led an evil life, his memory was condemned in the presence of thenation, and his body was denied the honors of sepulture. What a lessonthe old Masonry taught to the sons of the people!Is it true that Masonry is effete; that the acacia, withered, affords noshade; that Masonry no longer marches in the advance-guard of Truth?No. Is freedom yet universal? Have ignorance and prejudice disappearedfrom the earth? Are there no longer enmities among men? Do cupidityand falsehood no longer exist? Do toleration and harmony prevail amongreligious and political sects? There are works yet left for Masonry toaccomplish, greater than the twelve labors of Hercules: to advance everresolutely and steadily; to enlighten the minds of the people, toreconstruct society, to reform the laws, and to improve the public morals.The eternity in front of it is as infinite as the one behind. And Masonrycannot cease to labor in the cause of social progress, without ceasing tobe true to itself, Masonry. XII. GRAND MASTER ARCHITECT. [Master Architect.] THE great duties that are inculcated by the lessons taught by the workinginstruments of a Grand Master Architect, demanding so much of us, and taking for granted the capacity to perform them faithfully and fully, bring us at once to reflect upon the dignity of human nature, and the vast powers and capacities of the human soul; and to that theme we invite your attention in this Degree. Let us begin to rise from earth toward the Stars. Evermore the human soul struggles toward the light, toward God, and the Infinite. It is especially so in its afflictions. Words go but a little way into the depths of sorrow. The thoughts that writhe there in silence, that go into the stillness of Infinitude and Eternity, have no emblems. Thoughts enough come there, such as no tongue ever uttered. They do not so much want human sympathy, as higher help. There is a loneliness in deep sorrow which the Deity alone can relieve. Alone, the mind wrestles with the great problem of calamity, and seeks the solution from the Infinite Providence of Heaven, and thus is led directly to God. There are many things in us of which we are not distinctly conscious. To waken that slumbering consciousness into life, and so to lead the soul up to the Light, is one office of every great ministration to human nature, whether its vehicle be the pen, the pencil, or the tongue. We are unconscious of the intensity and awfulness of the life within us. Health and sickness, joy and sorrow, success and disappointment, life and death, love and loss, are familiar words upon our lips; and we do not know to what depths they point within us. We seem never to know what any thing means or is worth until we have lost it. Many an organ, nerve, and fibre in our bodily frame performs its silent part for years, and we are quite unconscious of its value. It is not until it is injured that we discover that value, and find how essential it was to our happiness and comfort. We never know the full significance of the words “property," "ease," and "health;" the wealth of meaning in the fond epithets, "parent,” “child," "beloved," and "friend," until the thing or the person is taken away; until, in place of the bright, visible being, comes the awful and desolate shadow, where nothing is: where we stretch out our hands in vain, and strain our eyes upon dark and dismal vacuity. Yet, in that vacuity, we do not lose the object that we loved. It becomes only the more real to us. Our blessings not only brighten when they depart, but are fixed in enduring reality; and love and friendship receive their everlasting seal under the cold impress of death. A dim consciousness of infinite mystery and grandeur lies beneath all the commonplace of life. There is an awfulness and a majesty around us, in all our little worldliness. The rude peasant from the Apennines, asleep at the foot of a pillar in a majestic Roman church, seems not to hear or see, but to, dream only of the herd he feeds or the ground he tills in the mountains. But the choral symphonies fall softly upon his ear, and the gilded arches are dimly seen through his half-slumbering eyelids. So the soul, however given up to the occupations of daily life, cannot quite lose the sense of where it is, and of what is above it and around it. The scene of its actual engagements may be small; the path of its steps, beaten and familiar; the objects it handles, easily spanned, and quite worn out with daily uses. So it may be, and amidst such things that we all live. So we live our little life; but Heaven is above us and all around and close to us; and Eternity is before us and behind us; and suns and stars are silent witnesses and watchers over us. We are enfolded by Infinity. Infinite Powers and Infinite spaces lie all around us. The dread arch of Mystery spreads over us, and no voice ever pierced it. Eternity is enthroned amid Heaven's myriad starry heights; and no utterance or word ever came from those far-off and silent spaces. Above, is that awful majesty; around us, everywhere, it stretches off into infinity; and beneath it is this little struggle of life, this poor day's conflict, this busy ant-hill of Time. But from that ant-hill, not only the talk of the streets, the sounds of music and revelling, the stir and tread of a multitude, the shout of joy and the shriek of agony go up into the silent and all-surrounding Infinitude; but also, amidst the stir and noise of visible life, from the inmost bosom of the visible man, there goes up an imploring call, a beseeching cry, an asking, unuttered, and unutterable, for revelation, wailingly and in almost speechless agony praying the dread arch of mystery to break, and the stars that roll above the waves of mortal trouble, to speak; the enthroned majesty of those awful heights to find a voice; the mysterious and reserved heavens to come near; and all to tell us what they alone know; to give us information of the loved and lost; to make known to us what we are, and whither we are going. Man is encompassed with a dome of incomprehensible wonders. In him and about him is that which should fill his life with majesty and sacredness. Something of sublimity and sanctity has thus flashed down from heaven into the heart of every one that lives. There is no being so base and abandoned but hath some traits of that sacredness left upon him; something, so much perhaps in discordance with his general repute, that he hides it from all around him; some sanctuary in his soul, where no one may enter; some sacred inclosure, where the memory of a child is, or the image of a venerated parent, or the remembrance of a pure love, or the echo of some word of kindness once spoken to him; an echo that will never die away. Life is no negative, or superficial or worldly existence. Our steps are evermore haunted with thoughts, far beyond their own range, which some have regarded as the reminiscences of a preexistent state. So it is with us all, in the beaten and worn track of this worldly pilgrimage. There is more here, than the world we live in. It is not all of life to live. An unseen and infinite presence is here; a sense of something greater than we possess; a seeking, through all the void wastes of life, for a good beyond it; a crying out of the heart for interpretation; a memory of the dead, touching continually some vibrating thread in this great tissue of mystery. We all not only have better intimations, but are capable of better thingsthan we know. The pressure of some great emergency would develop in us powers, beyond the worldly bias of our spirits; and Heaven so deals with us, from time to time, as to call forth those better things. There is hardly a family in the world go selfish, but that, if one in it were doomed to die - one, to be selected by the others, - it would be utterly impossible for its members, parents and children, to choose out that victim; but that each would say, "I will die; but I cannot choose." And in how many, if that dire extremity had come, would not one and another step forth, freed from the vile meshes of ordinary selfishness, and say, like the Roman father and son, "Let the blow fall on me!" There are greater and better things in us all, than the world takes account of, or than we take note of; if we would but find them out. And it is one part of our Masonic culture to find these traits of power and sublime devotion, to revive these faded impressions of generosity and self-sacrifice, the almost squandered bequests of God's love and kindness to our souls; and to induce us to yield ourselves to their guidance and control. Upon all conditions of men presses down one impartial law. To all situations, to all fortunes, high or low, the mind gives their character. They are, in effect, not what they are in themselves, but what they are to the feeling of their possessors. The King may be mean, degraded, miserable; the slave of ambition, fear, voluptuousness, and every low passion. The Peasant may be the real Monarch, the moral master of his fate, a free and lofty being, more than a Prince in happiness, more than a King in honor. Man is no bubble upon the sea of his fortunes, helpless and irresponsible upon the tide of events. Out of the same circumstances, different men bring totally different results. The same difficulty, distress, poverty, or misfortune, that breaks down one man, builds up another and makes him strong. It is the very attribute and glory of a man, that he can bend the circumstances of his condition to the intellectual and moral purposes of his nature, and it is the power and mastery of his will that chiefly distinguish him from the brute. The faculty of moral will, developed in the child, is a new element of his nature. It is a new power brought upon the scene, and a ruling power, delegated from Heaven. Never was a human being sunk so low that he had not, by God's gift, the power to rise, Because God commands him to rise, it is certain that he can rise.Every man has the power, and should use it, to make all situations, trials, and temptations instruments to promote his virtue and happiness; and is so far from being the creature of circumstances, that he creates and controls them, making them to be all that they are, of evil or of good, to him as a moral being. Life is what we make it, and the world is what we make it. The eyes of the cheerful and of the melancholy man are fixed upon the same creation; but very different are the aspects which it bears to them. To the one, it is all beauty and gladness; the waves of ocean roll in light, and the mountains are covered with day. Life, to him, flashes, rejoicing, upon every flower and every tree that trembles in the breeze. There is more to him, everywhere, than the eye sees; a presence of profound joy on hill and valley, and bright, dancing water. The other idly or mournfully gazes at the same scene, and everything wears a dull, dim, and sickly aspect. The murmuring of the brooks is a discord to him, the great roar of the sea has an angry and threatening emphasis, the solemn music of the pines sings the requiem of his departed happiness; the cheerful light shines garishly upon his eyes and offends him. The great train of the seasons passes before him like a funeral procession; and he sighs, and turns impatiently away. The eye makes that which it looks upon; the ear makes its own melodies and discords; the world without reflects the world within. Let the Mason never forget that life and the world are what we make them by our social character; by our adaptation, or want of adaptation to the social conditions, relationships, and pursuits of the world. To the selfish, the cold, and the insensible, to the haughty and presuming, to the proud, who demand more than they are likely to receive, to the jealous, ever afraid they shall not receive enough, to those who are unreasonably sensitive about the good or ill opinions of others, to all violators of the social laws, the rude, the violent, the dishonest, and the sensual, - to all these, the social condition, from its very nature, will present annoyances, disappointments, and pains, appropriate to their several characters. The benevolent affections will not revolve around selfishness; the cold-hearted must expect to meet coldness; the proud, haughtiness; the passionate, anger; and the violent, rudeness. Those who forget the rights of others, must not be surprised if their own are forgotten; and those who stoop to the lowest embraces of sense must not wonder, if others are not concerned to find their prostrate honor, and lift it up to the remembranceand respect of the world. To the gentle, many will be gentle; to the kind, many will be kind. A good man will find that there is goodness in the world; an honest man will find that there is honesty in the world; and a man of principle will find principle and integrity in the minds of others. There are no blessings which the mind may not convert into the bitterest of evils; and no trials which it may not transform into the noblest and divinest blessings. There are no temptations from which assailed virtue may not gain strength, instead of falling before them, vanquished and subdued. It is true that temptations have a great power, and virtue often falls; but the might of these temptations lies not in themselves, but in the feebleness of our own virtue, and the weakness of our own hearts. We rely too much on the strength of our ramparts and bastions, and allow the enemy to make his approaches, by trench and parallel, at his leisure. The offer of dishonest gain and guilty pleasure makes the honest man more honest, and the pure man more pure. They raise his virtue to the height of towering indignation. The fair occasion, the safe opportunity, the tempting chance become the defeat and disgrace of the tempter. The honest and upright man does not wait until temptation has made its approaches and mounted its batteries on the last parallel. But to the impure, the dishonest, the false-hearted, the corrupt, and the sensual, occasions come every day, and in every scene, and through every avenue of thought and imagination. He is prepared to capitulate before the first approach is commenced; and sends out the white flag when the enemy's advance comes in sight of his walls. He makes occasions; or, if opportunities come not, evil thoughts come, and he throws wide open the gates of his heart and welcomes those bad visitors, and entertains them with a lavish hospitality. The business of the world absorbs, corrupts, and degrades one mind, while in another it feeds and nurses the noblest independence, integrity, and generosity. Pleasure is a poison to some, and a healthful refreshment to others. To one, the world is a great harmony, like a noble strain of music with infinite modulations; to another, it is a huge factory, the clash and clang of whose machinery jars upon his ears and frets him to madness. Life is substantiallythe same thing to all who partake of its lot. Yet some rise to virtue and glory; while others, undergoing the same discipline, and enjoying the same privileges, sink to shame and perdition. Thorough, faithful, and honest endeavor to improve, is always successful, and the highest happiness. To sigh sentimentally over human misfortune, is fit only for the mind's childhood; and the mind's misery is chiefly its own fault; appointed, under the good Providence of God, as the punisher and corrector of its fault. In the long run, the mind will be happy, just in proportion to its fidelity and wisdom. When it is miserable, it has planted the thorns in its own path; it grasps them, and cries out in loud complaint;. and that complaint is but the louder confession that the thorns which grew there, it planted. A certain kind and degree of spirituality enter into the largest part of even the most ordinary life. You can carry on no business, without some faith in man. You cannot even dig in the ground, without a reliance on the unseen result. You cannot think or reason or even step, without confiding in the inward, spiritual principles of your nature. All the affections and bonds, and hopes and interests of life centre in the spiritual; and you know that if that central bond were broken, the world would rush to chaos. Believe that there is a God; that He is our father; that He has a paternal interest in our welfare and improvement; that He has given us powers, by means of which we may escape from sin and ruin; that He has destined us to a future life of endless progress toward perfection and a knowledge of Himself - believe this, as every Mason should, and you can live calmly, endure patiently, labor resolutely, deny yourselves cheerfully, hope steadfastly, and be conquerors in the great struggle of life. Take away any one of these principles, and what remains for us? Say that there is no God; or no way opened for hope and reformation and triumph, no heaven to come, no rest for the weary, no home in the bosom of God for the afflicted and disconsolate soul; or that God is but an ugly blind Chance that stabs in the dark; or a somewhat that is, when attempted to be defined, a nowhat, emotionless, passionless, the Supreme Apathy to which all things, good and evil, are alike indifferent; or a jealous God who revengefully visits the sins of the fathers on the children, and when the fathers have eatensour grapes, sets the children's teeth on edge; an arbitrary supreme Will, that has made it right to be virtuous, and wrong to lie and steal, because IT pleased to make it so rather than otherwise, retaining the power to reverse the law; or a fickle, vacillating, inconstant Deity, or a cruel, bloodthirsty, savage Hebrew or Puritanic one; and we are but the sport of chance and the victims of despair; hapless wanderers upon the face of a desolate, forsaken, or accursed and hated earth; surrounded by darkness, struggling with obstacles, toiling for barren results and empty purposes, distracted with doubts, and misled by false gleams of light; wanderers with no way, no prospect, no home; doomed and deserted mariners on a dark and stormy sea, without compass or course, to whom no stars appear; tossing helmless upon the weltering, angry waves, with no blessed haven in the distance whose guiding-star invites us to its welcome rest. The religious faith thus taught by Masonry is indispensable to the attainment of the great ends of life; and must therefore have been designed to be a part of it. We are made for this faith; and there must be something, somewhere, for us to believe in. We cannot grow healthfully, nor live happily, without it. It is therefore true. If we could cut off from any soul all the principles taught by Masonry, the faith in a God, in immortality, in virtue, in essential rectitude, that soul would sink into sin, misery, darkness, and ruin. If we could cut off all sense of these truths, the man would sink at once to the grade of the animal. No man can suffer and be patient, can struggle and conquer, can improve and be happy, otherwise than as the swine are, without conscience, without hope, without a reliance on a just, wise, and beneficent God. We must, of necessity, embrace the great truths taught by Masonry, and live by them, to live happily. "I put my trust in God," is the protest of Masonry against the belief in a cruel, angry, and revengeful God, to be feared and not reverenced by His creatures. Society, in its great relations, is as much the creation of Heaven as is the system of the Universe. If that bond of gravitation that holds all worlds and systems together, were suddenly severed, the universe would fly into wild and boundless chaos. And if we were to sever all the moral bonds that hold society together; if we could cut off from it every conviction of Truth and Integrity, of an authority above it, and of a conscience within it, it would immediately rush to disorder and frightful anarchy and ruin. The religion we teach is therefore as really a principle of things, and as certain and true, as gravitation. Faith in moral principles, in virtue, and in God, is as necessary for the guidance of a man, as instinct is for the guidance of an animal. And therefore this faith, as a principle of man's nature, has a mission as truly authentic in God's Providence, as the principle of instinct. The pleasures of the soul, too, must depend on certain principles. They must recognize a soul, its properties and responsibilities, a conscience, and the sense of an authority above us; and these are the principles of faith. No man can suffer and be patient, can struggle and conquer, can improve and be happy, without conscience, without hope, without a reliance on a just, wise, and beneficent God. We must of necessity embrace the great truths taught by Masonry, and live by them, to live happily. Everything in the universe has fixed and certain laws and principles for its action;- the star in its orbit, the animal in its activity, the physical man in his functions. And he has likewise fixed and certain laws and principles as a spiritual being. His soul does not die for want of aliment or guidance. For the rational soul there is ample provision. From the lofty pine, rocked in the darkening tempest, the cry of the young raven is heard; and it would be most strange if there were no answer for the cry and call of the soul, tortured by want and sorrow and agony. The total rejection of all moral and religious belief would strike out a principle from human nature, as essential to it as gravitation to the stars, instinct to animal life, the circulation of the blood to the human body. God has ordained that life shall be a social state. We are members of a civil community. The life of that community depends upon its moral condition. Public spirit, intelligence, uprightness, temperance, kindness, domestic purity, will make it a happy community, and give it prosperity and continuance. Wide-spread selfishness, dishonesty, intemperance, libertinism, corruption, and crime, will make it miserable, and bring about dissolution and speedy ruin. A whole people lives one life; one mighty heart heaves in its bosom; it is one great pulse of existence that throbs there. One stream of life flows there, with ten thousand intermingled branches and channels, through all the homes of human love. One sound as of many waters, a rapturous jubilee or a mournful sighing, comes up fromthe congregated dwellings of a whole nation. The Public is no vague abstraction; nor should that which is done against that Public, against public interest, law, or virtue, press but lightly on the conscience. It is but a vast expansion of individual life; an ocean of tears, an atmosphere of sighs, or a great whole of joy and gladness. It suffers with the suffering of millions; it rejoices with the joy of millions. What a vast crime does he commit, - private man or public man, agent or contractor, legislator or magistrate, secretary or president,-who dares, with indignity and wrong, to strike the bosom of the Public Welfare, to encourage venality and corruption, and shameful sale of the elective franchise, or of office; to sow dissension, and to weaken the bonds of amity that bind a Nation together! What a huge iniquity, he who, with vices like the daggers of a parricide, dares to pierce that mighty heart, in which the ocean of existence is flowing! What an unequalled interest lies in the virtue of every one whom we love! In his virtue, nowhere but in his virtue, is garnered up the incomparable treasure. What care we for brother or friend, compared with what we care for his honor, his fidelity, his reputation, his kindness? How venerable is the rectitude of a parent! How sacred his reputation! No blight that can fall upon a child, is like a parent's dishonor. Heathen or Christian, every parent would have his child do well; and pours out upon him all the fullness of parental love, in the one desire that he may do well; that he may be worthy of his cares, and his freely bestowed pains; that he may walk in the way of honor and happiness. In that way he cannot walk one step without virtue. Such is life, in its relationships. A thousand ties embrace it, like the fine nerves of a delicate organization; like the strings of an instrument capable of sweet melodies, but easily put out of tune or broken, by rudeness, anger, and selfish indulgence. If life could, by any process, be made insensible to pain and pleasure; if the human heart were hard as adamant, then avarice, ambition, and sensuality might channel out their paths in it, and make it their beaten way; and none would wonder or protest. If we could be patient under the load of a mere worldly life; if we could bear that burden as the beasts bear it; then, like beasts, we might bend all our thoughts to the earth; and no call from the great Heavens above us would startle us from our plodding and earthly course. But we art not insensible brutes, who can refuse the call of reason and conscience. The soul is capable of remorse. When the great dispensations of life press down upon us, we weep, and suffer and sorrow. And sorrow and agony desire other companionships than worldliness and irreligion. We are not willing to bear those burdens of the heart, fear, anxiety, disappointment, and trouble, without any object or use. We are not willing to suffer, to be sick and afflicted, to have our days and months lost to comfort and joy, and overshadowed with calamity and grief, without advantage or compensation; to barter away the dearest treasures, the very sufferings, of the heart; to sell the life-blood from failing frame and fading cheek, our tears of bitterness and groans of anguish, for nothing. Human nature, frail, feeling, sensitive, and sorrowing, cannot bear to suffer for nought. Everywhere, human life is a great and solemn dispensation. Man, suffering, enjoying, loving, hating, hoping, and fearing, chained to the earth and yet exploring the far recesses of the universe, has the power to commune with God and His angels. Around this great action of existence the curtains of Time are drawn; but there are openings through them which give us glimpses of eternity. God looks down upon this scene of human probation. The wise and the good in all ages have interposed for it with their teachings and their blood. Everything that exists around us, every movement in nature every counsel of Providence, every interposition of God, centres upon one point - the fidelity of man. And even if the ghosts of the departed and remembered could come at midnight through the barred doors of our dwellings, and the shrouded dead should glide through the aisles of our churches and sit in our Masonic Temples, their teachings would be no more eloquent and impressive than the Great realities of life; than those memories of misspent years, those ghosts of departed opportunities, that, pointing to our conscience and eternity cry continually in our ears, "Work while the day lasts! for the night of death cometh, in which no man can work.” There are no tokens of public mourning for the calamity of the soul. Men weep when the body dies; and when it is borne to its last rest, they follow it with sad and mournful procession. Butfor the dying soul there is no open lamentation; for the lost soul there are no obsequies. And yet the mind and soul of man have a value which nothing else has. They are worth a care which nothing else is worth; and to the single, solitary individual, they ought to possess an interest which nothing else possesses. The stored treasures of the heart, the unfathomable mines that are in the soul to be wrought, the broad and boundless realms of Thought, the freighted argosy of man's hopes and best affections, are brighter than gold and dearer than treasure. And yet the mind is in reality little known or considered. It is all which man permanently is, his inward being, his divine energy, his immortal thought, his boundless capacity, his infinite aspiration; and nevertheless, few value it for what it is worth. Few see a brother-mind in others, through the rags with which poverty has clothed it, beneath the crushing burdens of life, amidst the close pressure of worldly troubles, wants and sorrows. Few acknowledge and cheer it in that humble blot, and feel that the nobility of earth, and the commencing glory of Heaven are there. Men do not feel the worth of their own souls. They are proud of their mental powers; but the intrinsic, inner, infinite worth of their own minds they do not perceive. The poor man, admitted to a palace, feels, lofty and immortal being as he is, like a mere ordinary thing amid the splendors that surround him. He sees the carriage of wealth roll by him, and forgets the intrinsic and eternal dignity of his own mind in a poor and degrading envy, and feels as an humbler creature, because others are above him, not in mind, but in mensuration. Men respect themselves, according as they are more wealthy, higher in rank or office, loftier in the world's opinion, able to command more votes, more the favorites of the people or of Power. The difference among men is not so much in their nature and intrinsic power, as in the faculty of communication. Some have the capacity of uttering and embodying in words their thoughts. All men, more or less, feel those thoughts. The glory of genius and the rapture of virtue, when rightly revealed, are diffused and shared among unnumbered minds. When eloquence and poetry speak; when those glorious arts, statuary, painting, and music, take audible or visible shape; when patriotism, charity, and virtuespeak with a thrilling potency, the hearts of thousands glow with a kindred joy and ecstasy. If it were not so, there would be no eloquence; for eloquence is that to which other hearts respond; it is the faculty and power of making other hearts respond. No one is so low or degraded, as not sometimes to be touched with the beauty of goodness. No heart is made of materials so common, or even base, as not sometimes to respond, through every chord of it, to the call of honor, patriotism, generosity, and virtue. The poor African Slave will die for the master. or mistress, or in defence of the children, whom he loves. The poor, lost, scorned, abandoned, outcast woman will, without expectation of reward nurse those who are dying on every hand, utter strangers to her, with a contagious and horrid pestilence. The pickpocket will scale burning walls to rescue child or woman, unknown to him, from the ravenous flames. Most glorious is this capacity! A power to commune with God and His Angels; a reflection of the Uncreated Light; a mirror that can collect and concentrate upon itself all the moral splendors of the Universe. It is the soul alone that gives any value to the things of this world. and it is only by raising the soul to its just elevation above all other things, that we can look rightly upon the purposes of this earth. No sceptre nor throne, nor structure of ages, nor broad empire, can compare with the wonders and grandeurs of a single thought. That alone, of all things that have been made, comprehends the Maker of all. That alone is the key which unlocks all the treasures of the Universe; the power that reigns over Space, Time, and Eternity. That, under God, is the Sovereign Dispenser to man of all the blessings and glories that lie within the compass of possession, or the range of possibility. Virtue, Heaven, and Immortality exist not, nor ever will exist for us except as they exist and will exist, in the perception, feeling, and thought of the glorious mind. My Brother, in the hope that you have listened to and understood the Instruction and Lecture of this Degree, and that you feel the dignity of your own nature and the vast capacities of your own soul for good or evil, I proceed briefly to communicate to you the remaining instruction of this Degree. The Hebrew word, in the old Hebrew and Samaritan character, suspended in the East, over the five columns, is ADONAÏ, one of the names of God, usually translated Lord; and which theHebrews, in reading, always substitute for the True Name, which is for them ineffable. The five columns, in the five different orders of architecture, are emblematical to us of the five principal divisions of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite: 1. - The Tuscan, of the three blue Degrees, or the primitive Masonry. 2. - The Doric, of the ineffable Degrees, from the, fourth to the fourteenth, inclusive. 3. - The Ionic, of the fifteenth and sixteenth, or second temple Degrees. 4. - The Corinthian, of the seventeenth and eighteenth Degrees, or those of the new law. 5. - The Composite, of the philosophical and chivalric Degrees intermingled, from the nineteenth to the thirty-second, inclusive. The North Star, always fixed and immutable for us, represents the point in the centre of the circle, or the Deity in the centre of the Universe. It is the especial symbol of duty and of faith. To it, and the seven that continually revolve around it, mystical meanings are attached, which you will learn hereafter, if you should be permitted to advance, when you are made acquainted with the philosophical doctrines of the Hebrews. The Morning Star, rising in the East, Jupiter, called by the Hebrews Tsadõc or Tsydyk, Just, is an emblem to us of the ever approaching dawn of perfection and Masonic light. The three great lights of the Lodge are symbols to us of the Power, Wisdom, and Beneficence of the Deity. They are also symbols of the first three Sephiroth, or Emanations of the Deity, according to the Kabalah, Kether, the omnipotent divine will; Chochmah, the divine intellectual power to generate thought, and Binah, the divine intellectual capacity to produce it - the two latter, usually translated Wisdom and Understanding, being the active and the passive, the positive and the negative, which we do not yet endeavor to explain to you. They are the columns Jachin and Boaz, that stand at the entrance to the Masonic Temple. In another aspect of this Degree, the Chief of the Architects [ , Rab Banaim,] symbolizes the constitutional executive head and chief of a free government; and the Degree teaches us that no free government can long endure, when the people ceaseto select for their magistrates the best and the wisest of their statesmen; when, passing these by, they permit factions or sordid interests to select for them the small, the low, the ignoble, and the obscure, and into such hands commit the country's destinies. There is, after all, a "divine right" to govern; and it is vested in the ablest, wisest, best, of every nation. "Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding: I am power: by me kings do reign, and princes decree justice; by me princes rule, and nobles, even all the magistrates of the earth." For the present, my Brother, let this suffice. We welcome you among us, to this peaceful retreat of virtue, to a participation in our privileges, to a share in our joys and our sorrows. XIII. ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. WHETHER the legend and history of this Degree are historically true, or but an allegory, containing in itself a deeper truth and a profounder meaning, we shall not now debate. If it be but a legendary myth, you must find out for yourself what it means. It is certain that the word which the Hebrews are not now permitted to pronounce was in common use by Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Laban, Rebecca, and even among tribes foreign to the Hebrews, before the time of Moses; and that it recurs a hundred times in the lyrical effusions of David and other Hebrew poets. We know that for many centuries the Hebrews have been forbidden to pronounce the Sacred Name; that wherever it occurs, they have for ages read the word Adonaï instead; and that under it, when the masoretic points, which represent the vowels, came to be used, they placed those which belonged to the latter word. The possession of the true pronunciation was deemed to confer on him who had it extraordinary and supernatural powers; and the Word itself, worn upon the person, was regarded as an amulet, a protection against personal danger, sickness, and evil spirits. We know that all this was a vain superstition, natural to a rude people, necessarily disappearing as the intellect of man became enlightened; and wholly unworthy of a Mason. It is noticeable that this notion of the sanctity of the Divine Name or Creative Word was common to all the ancient nations. The Sacred Word HOM was supposed by the ancient Persians (who were among the earliest emigrants from Northern India) tobe pregnant with a mysterious power; and they taught that by its utterance the world was created. In India it was forbidden to pronounce the word AUM or OM, the Sacred Name of the One Deity, manifested as Brahma, Vishna, and Seeva. These superstitious notions in regard to the efficacy of the Word, and the prohibition against pronouncing it, could, being errors, have formed no part of the pure primitive religion, or of the esoteric doctrine taught by Moses, and the full knowledge of which was confined to the Initiates; unless the whole was but an ingenious invention for the concealment of some other Name or truth, the interpretation and meaning whereof was made known only to the select few. If so, the common notions in regard to the Word grew up in the minds of the people, like other errors and fables among all the ancient nations, out of original truths and symbols and allegories misunderstood. So it has always been that allegories, intended as vehicles of truth, to be understood by the sages, have become or bred errors, by being literally accepted. It is true, that before the masoretic points were invented (which was after the beginning of the Christian era), the pronunciation of a word in the Hebrew language could not be known from the characters in which it was written. It was, therefore, possible for that of the name of the Deity to have been forgotten and lost. It is certain that its true pronunciation is not that represented by the word Jehovah; and therefore that that is not the true name of Deity, nor the Ineffable Word. The ancient symbols and allegories always had more than one interpretation. They always had a double meaning, and sometimes more than two, one serving as the envelope of the other. Thus the pronunciation of the word was a symbol; and that pronunciation and the word itself were lost, when the knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God faded out of the minds of the Jewish people. That is one interpretation - true, but not the inner and profoundest one. Men were figuratively said to forget the name of God, when they lost that knowledge, and worshipped the heathen deities, and burned incense to them on the high places, and passed their children through the fire to Moloch. Thus the attempts of the ancient Israelites and of the Initiates to ascertain the True Name of the Deity, and its pronunciation, and the loss of the True Word, are an allegory, in which arerepresented the general ignorance of the true nature and attributes of God, the proneness of the people of Judah and Israel to worship other deities, and the low and erroneous and dishonoring notions of the Grand Architect of the Universe, which all shared except a few favored persons; for even Solomon built altars and sacrificed to Astarat, the goddess of the Tsidumm, and Malcüm, the Aamünite god, and built high places for Kamüs, the Moabite deity, and Malec the god of the Beni-Aamün. The true nature of God was unknown to them, like His name; and they worshipped the calves of Jeroboam, as in the desert they did that made for them by Aarün. The mass of the Hebrews did not believe in the existence of one only God until a late period in their history. Their. early and popular ideas of the Deity were singularly low and unworthy. Even while Moses was receiving the law upon Mount Sinai, they forced Aarün to make them an image of the Egyptian god Apis, and fell down and adored it. They were ever ready to return to the worship of the gods of the Mitzraim; and soon after the death of Joshua they became devout worshippers of the false gods of all the surrounding nations. "Ye have borne," Amos, the prophet, said to them, speaking of their forty years' journeying in the desert, under Moses, "the tabernacle of your Malec and Kaiün your idols, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves." Among them, as among other nations, the conceptions of God formed by individuals varied according to their intellectual and spiritual capacities; poor and imperfect, and investing God with the commonest and coarest attributes of humanity, among the ignorant and coarse; pure and lofty among the virtuous and richly gifted. These conceptions gradually improved and became purified and ennobled, as the nation advanced in civilization - being lowest in the historical books, amended in the prophetic writings, and reaching their highest elevation among the poets. Among all the ancient nations there was one faith and one idea of Deity for the enlightened, intelligent, and educated, and another for the common people. To this rule the Hebrews were no exception. Yehovah, to the mass of the people, was like the gods of the nations around them, except that he was the peculiar God, first of the family of Abraham, of that of Isaac, and of that of Jacob, and afterward the National God; and, as they believed, more powerful than the other gods of the same nature worshippedby their neighbors - "Who among the Baalim is like unto thee, O Yehovah?" - expressed their whole creed. The Deity of the early Hebrews talked to Adam and Eve in the garden of delight, as he walked in it in the cool of the day; he conversed with Kayin; he sat and ate with Abraham in his tent; that patriarch required a visible token, before he would believe in his positive promise; he permitted Abraham to expostulate with him, and to induce him to change his first determination in regard to Sodom; he wrestled with Jacob; he showed Moses his person, though not his face; he dictated the minutest police regulations and the dimensions of the tabernacle and its furniture, to the Israelites; he insisted on and delighted in sacrifices and burnt-offerings; he was angry, jealous, and revengeful, as well as wavering and irresolute; he allowed Moses to reason him out of his fixed resolution utterly to destroy his people; he commanded the performance of the most shocking and hideous acts of cruelty and barbarity. He hardened the heart of Pharaoh; he repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto the people of Nineveh; and he did it not, to the disgust and anger of Jonah. Such were the popular notions of the Deity; and either the priests had none better, or took little trouble to correct these notions; or the popular intellect was not enough enlarged to enable them to entertain any higher conceptions of the Almighty. But such were not the ideas of the intellectual and enlightened few among the Hebrews. It is certain that they possessed a knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God; as the same class of men did among the other nations - Zoroaster, Menu, Confucius, Socrates, and Plato. But their doctrines on this subject were esoteric; they did not communicate them to the people at large, but only to a favored few; and as they were communicated in Egypt and India, in Persia and Phoenicia, in Greece and Samothrace, in the greater mysteries, to the Initiates. The communication of this knowledge and other secrets, some of which are perhaps lost, constituted, under other names, what we now call Masonry, or Free or Frank-Masonry. That knowledge was, in one sense, the Lost Word, which was made known to the Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Masons. It would be folly to pretend that the forms of Masonry were the same in those ages as they are now. The present name of the Order, and its titles, and the names of the Degrees now in use, were not then known.Even Blue Masonry cannot trace back its authentic history, with its present Degrees, further than the year 1700, if so far. But, by whatever name it was known in this or the other country, Masonry existed as it now exists, the same in spirit and at heart, not only when Solomon builded the temple, but centuries before - before even the first colonies emigrated into Southern India, Persia, and Egypt, from the cradle of the human race. The Supreme, Self-existent, Eternal, All-wise, All-powerful, Infinitely Good, Pitying, Beneficent, and Merciful Creator and Preserver of the Universe was the same, by whatever name he was called, to the intellectual and enlightened men of all nations. The name was nothing, if not a symbol and representative hieroglyph of his nature and attributes. The name AL represented his remoteness above men, his inaccessibility; BAL and BALA, his might; ALOHIM, his various potencies; IHUH, existence and the generation of things. None of his names, among the Orientals, were the symbols of a divinely infinite love and tenderness, and all-embracing mercy. As MOLOCH or MALEK he was but an omnipotent monarch, a tremendous and irresponsible Will; as ADONAÏ, only an arbitrary LORD and Master; as AL Shadaï, potent and a DESTROYER. To communicate true and correct ideas in respect of the Deity was one chief object of the mysteries. In them, Khürüm the King, and Khürüm the Master, obtained their knowledge of him and his attributes; and in them that knowledge was taught to Moses and Pythagoras. Wherefore nothing forbids you to consider the whole legend of this Degree, like that of the Master's, an allegory, representing the perpetuation of the knowledge of the True God in the sanctuaries of initiation. By the subterranean vaults you may understand the places of initiation, which in the ancient ceremonies were generally under ground. The Temple of Solomon presented a symbolic image of the Universe; and resembled, in its arrangements and furniture, all the temples of the ancient nations that practised the mysteries. The system of numbers was intimately connected with their religions and worship, and has come down to us in Masonry; though the esoteric meaning with which the numbers used by us are pregnant is unknown to the vast majority of those who use them. Those numbers were especially employed that had a reference to the Deity, represented his attributes, or figured in theframe-work of the world, in time and space, and formed more or less the bases of that frame-work. These were universally regarded as sacred, being the expression of order and intelligence, the utterances of Divinity Himself. The Holy of Holies of the Temple formed a cube; in which, drawn on a plane surface, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 lines visible, and three sides or faces. It corresponded with the number four, by which the ancients presented Nature, it being the number of substances or corporeal forms, and of the elements, the cardinal points and seasons, and the secondary colors. The number three everywhere represented the Supreme Being. Hence the name of the Deity, engraven upon the triangular plate, and that sunken into the cube of agate, taught the ancient Mason, and teaches us, that the true knowledge of God, of His nature and His attributes is written by Him upon the leaves of the great Book of Universal Nature, and may be read there by all who are endowed with the requisite amount of intellect and intelligence. This knowledge of God, so written there, and of which Masonry has in all ages been the interpreter, is the Master Mason's Word. Within the Temple, all the arrangements were mystically and symbolically connected with the same system. The vault or ceiling, starred like the firmament, was supported by twelve columns, representing the twelve months of the year. The border that ran around the columns represented the zodiac, and one of the twelve celestial signs was appropriated to each column. The brazen sea was supported by twelve oxen, three looking to each cardinal point of the compass. And so in our day every Masonic Lodge represents the Universe. Each extends, we are told, from the rising to the setting sun, from the South to the North, from the surface of the Earth to the Heavens, and from the same to the centre of the globe. In it are represented the sun, moon, and stars; three great torches in the East, West, and South, forming a triangle, give it light: and, like the Delta or Triangle suspended in the East, and inclosing the Ineffable Name, indicate, by the mathematical equality of the angles and sides, the beautiful and harmonious proportions which govern in the aggregate and details of the Universe; while those sides and angles represent, by their number, three, the Trinity of Power, Wisdom, and Harmony, which presided at the building of this marvellous work These three great lights also represent thegreat mystery of the three principles, of creation, dissolution or destruction, and reproduction or regeneration, consecrated by all creeds in their numerous Trinities. The luminous pedestal, lighted by the perpetual flame within, is a symbol of that light of Reason, given by God to man, by which he is enabled to read in the Book of Nature the record of the thought, the revelation of the attributes of the Deity. The three Masters, Adoniram, Joabert, and Stolkin, are types of the True Mason, who seeks for knowledge from pure motives, and that he may be the better enabled to serve and benefit his fellow-men; while the discontented and presumptuous Masters who were buried in the ruins of the arches represent those who strive to acquire it for unholy purposes, to gain power over their fellows, to gratify their pride, their vanity, or their ambition. The Lion that guarded the Ark and held in his mouth the key wherewith to open it, figuratively represents Solomon, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who preserved and communicated the key to the true knowledge of God, of His laws, and of the profound mysteries of the moral and physical Universe. ENOCH [ Khanõc], we are told, walked with God three hundred years, after reaching the age of sixty-five - "walked with God, and he was no more, for God had taken him." His name signified in the Hebrew, INITIATE or INITIATOR. The legend of the columns, of granite and brass or bronze, erected by him, is probably symbolical. That of bronze, which survived the flood, is supposed to symbolize the mysteries, of which Masonry is the legitimate successor - from the earliest times the custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths, unknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems, and allegories. The legend of this Degree is thus, partially, interpreted. It is of little importance whether it is in anywise historical. For its value consists in the lessons which it inculcates, and the duties which it prescribes to those who receive it. The parables and allegories of the Scriptures are not less valuable than history. Nay, they are more so, because ancient history is little instructive, and truths are concealed in and symbolized by the legend and the myth. There are profounder meanings concealed in the symbols of this Degree, connected with the philosophical system of the HebrewKabalists, which you will learn hereafter, if you should be so fortunate as to advance. They are unfolded in the higher Degrees. The lion [ Arai, Araiah, which also means the altar] still holds in his mouth the key of the enigma of the sphynx. But there is one application of this Degree, that you are now entitled to know; and which, remembering that Khürüm, the Master, is the symbol of human freedom, you would probably discover for yourself. It is not enough for a people to gain its liberty. It must secure it. It must not intrust it to the keeping, or hold it at the pleasure, of any one man. The keystone of the Royal Arch of the great Temple of Liberty is a fundamental law, charter, or constitution; the expression of the fixed habits of thought of the people, embodied in a written instrument, or the result of the slow accretions and the consolidation of centuries; the same in war as in peace; that cannot be hastily changed, nor be violated with impunity, but is sacred, like the Ark of the Covenant of God, which none could touch and live. A permanent constitution, rooted in the affections, expressing the will and judgment, and built upon the instincts and settled habits of thought of the people, with an independent judiciary, an elective legislature of two branches, an executive responsible to the people, and the right of trial by jury, will guarantee the liberties of a people, if it be virtuous and temperate, without luxury, and without the lust of conquest and dominion, and the follies of visionary theories of impossible perfection. Masonry teaches its Initiates that the pursuits and occupations of this life, its activity, care, and ingenuity, the predestined developments of the nature given us by God, tend to promote His great design, in making the world; and are not at war with the great purpose of life. It teaches that everything is beautiful in its time, in its place, in its appointed office; that everything which man is put to do, if rightly and faithfully done, naturally helps to work out his salvation; that if he obeys the genuine principles of his calling, he will be a good man: and that it is only by neglect and nonperformance of the task set for him by Heaven, by wandering into idle dissipation, or by violating their beneficent and lofty spirit, that he becomes a bad man. The appointed action of life is the great training of Providence; and if man yields himselfto it, he will need neither churches nor ordinances, except for the expression of his religious homage and gratitude. For there is a religion of toil. It is not all drudgery, a mere stretching of the limbs and straining of the sinews to tasks. It has a meaning and an intent. A living heart pours life-blood into the toiling arm; and warm affections inspire and mingle with man's labors. They are the home affections. Labor toils a-field, or plies its task in cities, or urges the keels of commerce over wide oceans; but home is its centre; and thither it ever goes with its earnings, with the means of support and comfort for others; offerings sacred to the thought of every true man, as a sacrifice at a golden shrine. Many faults there are amidst the toils of life; many harsh and hasty words are uttered; but still the toils go on, weary and hard and exasperating as they often are. For in that home is age or sickness, or helpless infancy, or gentle childhood, or feeble woman, that must not want. If man had no other than mere selfish impulses, the scene of labor which we behold around us would not exist. The advocate who fairly and honestly presents his case, with feeling of true self-respect, honor, and conscience, to help the tribunal on towards the right conclusion, with a conviction that God's justice reigns there, is acting a religious part, leading that day religious life; or else right and justice are no part of religion Whether, during all that day, he has once appealed, in form or in terms, to his conscience, or not; whether he has once spoken of religion and God, or not; if there has been the inward purpose, the conscious intent and desire, that sacred justice should triumph, he has that day led a good and religious life, and made most a essential contribution to that religion of life and of society, the cause of equity between man and man, and of truth and right action in the world. Books, to be of religious tendency in the Masonic sense, need not be books of sermons, of pious exercises, or of prayers. Whatever inculcates pure, noble, and patriotic sentiments, or touches the heart with the beauty of virtue, and the excellence of an upright life, accords with the religion of Masonry, and is the Gospel of literature and art. That Gospel is preached from many a book and painting, from many a poem and fiction, and review and newspaper; and it is a painful error and miserable narrowness, not to recognize these wide-spread agencies of Heaven's providing; notto see and welcome these many-handed coadjutors, to the great and good cause. The oracles of God do not speak from the pulpit alone. There is also a religion of society. In business, there is much more than sale, exchange, price, payment; for there is the sacred faith of man in man. When we repose perfect confidence in the integrity of another; when we feel that he will not swerve from the right, frank, straightforward, conscientious course, for any temptation; his integrity and conscientiousness are the image of God to us; and when we believe in it, it is as great and generous an act, as when we believe in the rectitude of the Deity. In gay assemblies for amusement, the good affections of life gush and mingle. If they did not, these gathering-places would be as dreary and repulsive as the caves and dens of outlaws and robbers. When friends meet, and hands are warmly pressed, and the eye kindles and the countenance is suffused with gladness, there is a religion between their hearts; and each loves and worships the True and Good that is in the other. It is not policy, or self-interest, or selfishness that spreads such a charm around that meeting, but the halo of bright and beautiful affection. The same splendor of kindly liking, and affectionate regard, shines like the soft overarching sky, over all the world; over all places where men meet, and walk or toil together; not over lovers' bowers and marriage-altars alone, not over the homes of purity and tenderness alone; but over all tilled fields, and busy workshops, and dusty highways, and paved streets. There is not a worn stone upon the sidewalks, but has been the altar of such offerings of mutual kindness; nor a wooden pillar or iron railing against which hearts beating with affection have not leaned. How many soever other elements there are in the stream of life flowing through these channels, that is surely here and everywhere; honest, heartfelt, disinterested, inexpressible affection. Every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion; and its teachings are instruction in religion. For here are inculcated disinterestedness, affection, toleration, devotedness, patriotism, truth, a generous sympathy with those who suffer and mourn, pity for the fallen, mercy for the erring, relief for those in want, Faith, Hope, and Charity. Here we meet as brethren, to learn to know and love each other. Here we greet each other gladly, are lenient to each other's faults, regardful of each other's feelings, ready to relieveeach other's wants. This is the true religion revealed to the ancient patriarchs; which Masonry has taught for many centuries, and which it will continue to teach as long as time endures. If unworthy passions, or selfish, bitter, or revengeful feelings, contempt, dislike, hatred, enter here, they are intruders and n t welcome, strangers uninvited, and not guests. Certainly there are many evils and bad passions, and much hate and contempt and unkindness everywhere in the world. We cannot refuse to see the evil -that is in life. But all is not evil. We still see God in the world. There is good amidst the evil. The hand of mercy leads wealth to the hovels of poverty and sorrow. Truth and simplicity live amid many wiles and sophistries. There are good hearts underneath gay robes, and under tattered garments also. Love clasps the hand of love, amid all the envyings and distractions of showy competition; fidelity, pity, and sympathy hold the long night-watch by the bedside of the suffering neighbor, amidst the surrounding poverty and squalid misery. Devoted men go from city to city to nurse those smitten down by the terrible pestilence that renews at intervals its mysterious marches. Women well-born and delicately nurtured nursed the wounded soldiers in hospitals, before it became fashionable to do so; and even poor lost women, whom God alone loves and pities, tend the plaguestricken with a patient and generous heroism. Masonry and its kindred Orders teach men to love each other, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the sick, and bury the friendless dead. Everywhere God finds and blesses the kindly office, the pitying thought, and the loving heart. There is an element of good in all men's lawful pursuits and a divine spirit breathing in all their lawful affections. The ground on which they tread is holy ground. There is a natural religion of life, answering, with however many a broken tone, to the religion of nature. There is a beauty and glory in Humanity., in man, answering, with however many a mingling shade, to the loveliness of soft landscapes and swelling hills, and the wondrous Men may be virtuous, self-improving, and religious in their employments. Precisely for that, those employments were made. All their social relations, friendship, love , the ties of family, were made to be holy. They may be religious, not by a kind of protestand resistance against their several vocations; but by conformity to their true spirit. Those vocations do not exclude religion; but demand it, for their own perfection. They may be religious laborers, whether in field or factory; religious physicians, lawyers, sculptors, poets, painters, and musicians. They may be religious in all the toils and in all the amusements of life. Their life may be a religion; the broad earth its altar; its incense the very breath of life; its fires ever kindled by the brightness of Heaven. Bound up with our poor, frail life, is the mighty thought that spurns the narrow span of all visible existence. Ever the soul reaches outward, and asks for freedom. It looks forth from the narrow and grated windows of sense, upon the wide immeasurable creation; it knows that around it and beyond it lie outstretched the infinite and everlasting paths. Everything within us and without us ought to stir our minds to admiration and wonder. We are a mystery encompassed with mysteries. The connection of mind with matter is a mystery; the wonderful telegraphic communication between the brain and every part of the body, the power and action of the will. Every familiar step is more than a story in a land of enchantment. The power of movement is as mysterious as the power of thought. Memory, and dreams that are the indistinct echoes of dead memories are alike inexplicable. Universal harmony springs from infinite complication. The momentum of every step we take in our dwelling contributes in part to the order of the Universe. We are connected by ties of thought, and even of matter and its forces, with the whole boundless Universe and all the past and coming generations of men. The humblest object beneath our eye as completely defies our scrutiny as the economy of the most distant star. Every leaf and every blade of grass holds within itself secrets which no human penetration will ever fathom. No man can tell what is its principle of life. No man can know what his power of secretion is. Both are inscrutable mysteries. Wherever we place our hand we lay it upon the locked bosom of mystery. Step where we will, we tread upon wonders. The sea-sands, the clods of the field, the water-worn pebbles on the hills, the rude masses of rock, are traced over and over, in every direction, with a handwriting older and more significant and sublime than all the ancient ruins, and all the overthrown and buried cities that past generationshave left upon the earth; for it is the handwriting of the Almighty. A Mason's great business with life is to read the book of its teaching; to find that life is not the doing of drudgeries, but the hearing of oracles. The old mythology is but a leaf in that book; for it peopled the world with spiritual natures; and science, many-leaved, still spreads before us the same tale of wonder. We shall be just as happy hereafter, as we are pure and upright, and no more, just as happy as our character prepares us to be, and no more. Our moral, like our mental character, is nut formed in a moment; it is the habit of our minds; the result of many thoughts and feelings and efforts, bound together by many natural and strong ties. The great law of Retribution is, that all coming experience is to be affected by every present feeling; every future moment of being must answer for every present moment; one moment, sacrificed to vice, or lost to improvement, is forever sacrificed and lost; an hour's delay to enter the right path, is to put us back so far, in the everlasting pursuit of happiness; and every sin, even of the best men, is to be thus answered for, if not according to the full measure of its illdesert, yet according to a rule of unbending rectitude and impartiality. The law of retribution presses upon every m an, whether he thinks of it or not. It pursues him through all the courses of life, with a step that never falters nor tires, and with an eye that never sleeps. If it were not so, God's government would not be impartial; 'there would be no discrimination; no moral dominion; no light shed upon the mysteries of Providence. Whatsoever a man soweth, that, and not something else, shall he reap. That which we are doing, good or evil, grave or gay, that which we do today and shall do to-morrow; each thought, each feeling, each action, each event; every passing hour, every breathing moment; all are contributing to form the character according to which we are to be judged. Every particle of influence that goes to form that aggregate, - our character, - will, in that future scrutiny, be sifted out from the mass; and, particle by particle, with ages perhaps intervening, fall a distinct contribution to the sum of our joys or woes. Thus every idle word and idle hour will give answer in the judgment. Let us take care, therefore, what we sow. An evil temptation comes upon us; the opportunity of unrighteous gain, or of unhallowedindulgence, either in the sphere of business or pleasure, of society or solitude. We yield; and plant a seed of bitterness and sorrow. To-morrow it will threaten discovery. Agitated and alarmed, we cover the sin, and bury it deep in falsehood and hypocrisy. In the bosom where it lies concealed, in the fertile soil of kindred vices, that sin dies not, but thrives and grows; and other and still other germs of evil gather around the accursed root; until, from that single seed of corruption, there springs up in the soul all that is horrible in habitual lying, knavery, or vice. Loathingly, often, we take each downward step; but a frightful power urges us onward; and the hell of debt, disease, ignominy, or remorse gathers its shadows around Our steps even on earth; and are yet but the beginnings of sorrows. The evil deed may be done in a single moment; but conscience never dies, memory never sleeps; guilt never can become innocence; and remorse can never whisper peace. Beware, thou who art tempted to evil! Beware what thou layest up for the future! Beware what thou layest up in the archives of eternity! Wrong not thy neighbor! lest the thought of him thou injurest, and who suffers by thy act, be to thee a pang which years will not deprive of its bitterness! Break not into the house of innocence, to rifle it of its treasure; lest when many years have passed over thee, the moan of its distress may not have died away from thine ear! Build not the desolate throne of ambition in thy heart; nor be busy with devices, and circumventings, and selfish schemings; lest desolation and loneliness be on thy path, as it stretches into the long futurity! Live not a useless, an impious, or an injurious life! for bound up with that life is the immutable principle of an endless retribution, and elements of God's creating, which will never spend their force, but continue ever to unfold with the ages of eternity. Be not deceived! God has formed thy nature, thus to answer to the future. His law can never be abrogated, nor His justice eluded; and forever and ever it will be true, that "Whatsoever a man soweth, that also he shall reap.” XIV. GRAND ELECT, PERFECT, AND SUBLIMEMASON.[Perfect Elu.] It is for each individual Mason to discover the secret of Ma-sonry, by reflection upon its symbols and a wise consideration andanalysis of what is said and done in the work. Masonry does notinculcate her truths. She states them, once and briefly; or hintsthem, perhaps, darkly; or interposes a cloud between them andeyes that would be dazzled by them. "Seek, and ye shall find,"knowledge and the truth.The practical object of Masonry is the physical and moralamelioration and the intellectual and spiritual improvement ofindividuals and society. Neither can be effected, except by thedissemination of truth. It is falsehood in doctrines and fallacyin principles, to which most of the miseries of men and the mis-fortunes of nations are owing. Public opinion is rarely right onany point; and there are and always will be important truths tobe substituted in that opinion in the place of many errors andabsurd and injurious prejudices. There are few truths that publicopinion has not at some time hated and persecuted as heresies;and few errors that have not at some time seemed to it truths radi-ant from the immediate presence of God. There are moral mala-dies, also, of man and society, the treatment of which requires notonly boldness, but also, and more, prudence and discretion; sincethey are more the fruit of false and pernicious doctrines, moral,political, and religious, than of vicious inclinations.Much of the Masonic secret manifests itself, without speechrevealing it to him who even partially comprehends all the De-grees in proportion as he receives them; and particularly to thosewho advance to the highest Degrees of the Ancient and AcceptedScottish Rite. That Rite raises a corner of the veil, even in theDegree of Apprentice; for it there declares that Masonry is aworship.Masonry labors to improve the social order by enlighteningmen's minds, warming their hearts with the love of the good, in-spiring them with the great principle of human fraternity, andrequiring of its disciples that their language and actions shall con-form to that principle, that they shall enlighten each other, con-trol their passions, abhor vice, and pity the vicious man as oneafflicted with a deplorable malady.It is the universal, eternal, immutable religion, such as Godplanted it in the heart of universal humanity. No creed has everbeen long-lived that was not built on this foundation. It is thebase, and they are the superstructure. "Pure religion and unde-filed before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless andwidows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from theworld." "Is not this the fast that I have chosen ? to loose thebands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let theoppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke ?" The ministersof this religion are all Masons who comprehend it and are devotedto it; its sacrifices to God are good works, the sacrifices of thebase and disorderly passions, the offering up of self-interest onthe altar of humanity, and perpetual efforts to attain to all themoral perfection of which man is capable.To make honor and duty the steady beacon-lights that shallguide your life-vessel over the stormy seas of time; to do thatwhich it is right to do, not because it will insure you success, orbring with it a reward, or gain the applause of men, or be "thebest policy," more prudent or more advisable; but because it isright, and therefore ought to be done; to war incessantly againsterror, intolerance, ignorance, and vice, and yet to pity those whoerr, to be tolerant even of intolerance, to teach the ignorant, andto labor to reclaim the vicious, are some of the duties of a Mason.A good Mason is one that can look upon death, and see its facewith the same countenance with which he hears its story; thatcan endure all the labors of his life with his soul supporting hisbody, that can equally despise riches when he hath them andwhen he hath them not;that is, not sadder if they are in his neigh-bor's exchequer, nor more lifted up if they shine around about hisown walls; one that is not moved with good fortune coming tohim, nor going from him; that can look upon another man's landswith equanimity and pleasure, as if they were his own; and yetlook upon his own, and use them too, just as if they were anotherman's; that neither spends his goods prodigally and foolishly, noryet keeps them avariciously and like a miser; that weighs notbenefits by weight and number, but by the mind and circumstancesof him who confers them; that never thinks his charity expen-sive, if a worthy person be the receiver; that does nothing foropinion's sake, but everything for conscience, being as careful ofhis thoughts as of his acting in markets and theatres, and in asmuch awe of himself as of a whole assembly; that is, bountifuland cheerful to his friends, and charitable and apt to forgive hisenemies; that loves his country, consults its honor, and obeys itslaws, and desires and endeavors nothing more than that he maydo his duty and honor God. And such a Mason may reckon hislife to be the life of a man, and compute his months, not bythe course of the sun, but by the zodiac and circle of his vir-tues.The whole world is but one republic, of which each nation is afamily, and every individual a child. Masonry, not in anywisederogating from the differing duties which the diversity of statesrequires, tends to create a new people, which, composed of men ofmany nations and tongues, shall all be bound together by thebonds of science, morality, and virtue.Essentially philanthropic, philosophical, and progressive, it hasfor the basis of its dogma a firm belief in the existence of Godand his providence, and of the immortality of the soul; for itsobject, the dissemination of moral, political, philosophical, andreligious truth, and the practice of all the virtues. In every age,its device has been, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," with constitu-tional government, law, order, discipline, and subordination tolegitimate authority--government and not anarchy.But it is neither a political party nor a religious sect. Itbraces all parties and all sects, to form from among them all a vastfraternal association. It recognizes the dignity of human nature,and man's right to such freedom as he is fitted for; and itknows nothing that should place one man below another, exceptignorance, debasement, and crime, and the necessity of subordina-tion to lawful will and authority.It is philanthropic; for it recognizes the great truth that allmen are of the same origin, have common interests, and shouldco-operate together to the same end.Therefore it teaches its members to love one another, to give toeach other mutual assistance and support in all the circumstancesof life, to share each other's pains and sorrows, as well as theirjoys and pleasures; to guard the reputations, respect the opinions,and be perfectly tolerant of the errors, of each other, in mattersof faith and beliefs.It is philisophical because it teaches the great Truths concern-ing the nature and existence of one Supreme Deity, and the exist-ence and immortality of the soul. It revives the Academy ofPlato and the wise teachings of Socrates. It reiterates the max-ims of Pythagoras, Confucius, and Zoroaster, and reverentiallyenforces the sublime lessons of Him who died upon the Cross.The ancients thought that universal humanity acted under theinfluence of two opposing Principles, the Good and the Evil: ofwhich the Good urged men toward Truth, Independence, and De-votedness and the Evil toward Falsehood, Servility, and Selfish-ness. Masonry represents the Good Principle and constantly warsagainst the evil one. It is the Hercules, the Osiris, the Apollo, theMithras, and the Ormuzd, at everlasting and deadly feud withthe demons of ignorance, brutality, baseness, falsehood, slavish-ness of soul, intolerance, superstition, tyranny, meanness, the in-solence of wealth, and bigotry.When despotism and superstition, twin-powers of evil and dark-ness, reigned everywhere and seemed invincible and immortal, itinvented, to avoid persecution, the mysteries, that is to say, theallegory, the symbol, and the emblem, and transmitted its doc-trines by the secret mode of initiation. Now, retaining its ancientsymbols, and in part its ancient ceremonies, it displays in everycivilized country its banner, on which in letters of living light itsgreat principles are written; and it smiles at the puny efforts ofkings and popes to crush it out by excommunication and inter-diction.Man's views in regard to God, will contain only so much posi-tive truth as the human mind is capable of receiving; whetherthat truth is attained by the exercise of reason, or communicatedby revelation. It must necessarily be both limited and alloyed, tobring it within the competence of finite human intelligence. Be-ing finite, we can form no correct or adequate idea of the Infinite;being material, we can form no clear conception of the Spiritual.We do believe in and know the infinity of Space and Time, andthe spirituality of the Soul; but the idea of that infinity andspirituality eludes us. Even Omnipotence cannot infuse infiniteconceptions into finite minds; nor can God, without first entirelychanging the conditions of our being, pour a complete and fullknowledge of His own nature and attributes into the narrowcapacity of a human soul. Human intelligence could not graspit, nor human language express it. The visible is, necessarily, themeasure of the invisible.The consciousness of the individual reveals itself alone. Hisknowledge cannot pass beyond the limits of his own being. Hisconceptions of other things and other beings are only his concep-tions. They are not those things or beings themselves. The livingprinciple of a living Universe must be INFINITE; while all ourideas and conceptions are finite, and applicable only to finite beings.The Deity is thus not an object of knowledge, but of faith; notto be approached by the understanding, but by the moral sense;not to be conceived, but to be felt. All attempts to embrace theInfinite in the conception of the Finite are, and must be only ac-commodations to the frailty of man. Shrouded from human com-prehension in an obscurity from which a chastened imagination isawed back, and Thought retreats in conscious weakness, theDivine Nature is a theme on which man is little entitled to dog-matize. Here the philosophic Intellect becomes most painfullyaware of its own insufficiency.And yet it is here that man most dogmatizes, classifies and de-scribes God's attributes, makes out his map of God's nature, andhis inventory of God's qualities, feelings, impulses, and passions;and then hangs and burns his brother, who, as dogmatically as he,makes out a different map and inventory. The common under-standing has no humility. Its God is an incarnate Divinity. Im-perfection imposes its own limitations on the Illimitable, andclothes the Inconceivable Spirit of the Universe in forms thatcome within the grasp of the senses and the intellect, and arederived from that infinite and imperfect nature which is but God'screation.We are all of us, though not all equally, mistaken. The cher-ished dogmas of each of us are not, as we fondly suppose, the puretruth of God; but simply our own special form of error, ourguesses at truth, the refracted and fragmentary rays of light thathave fallen upon our own minds. Our little systems have theirday, and cease to be; they are but broken lights of God; and Heis more than they. Perfect truth is not attainable anywhere. Westyle this Degree that of Perfection; and yet what it teaches isimperfect and defective. Yet we are not to relax in the pursuitof truth, nor contentedly acquiesce in error. It is our duty alwaysto press forward in the search; for though absolute truth is unat-tainable, yet the amount of error in our views is capable of pro-gressive and perpetual diminution; and thus Masonry is a con-tinual struggle toward the light.All errors are not equally innocuous. That which is most in-jurious is to entertain unworthy conceptions of the nature andattributes of God; and it is this that Masonry symbolizes by igno-rance of the True Word. The true word of a Mason is, not theentire, perfect, absolute truth in regard to God; but the highestand noblest conception of Him that our minds are capable offorming; and this word is Ineffable, because one man cannotcommunicate to another his own conception of Deity; since everyman's conception of God must be proportioned to his mental cul-tivation and intellectual powers, and moral excellence. God is, asman conceives Him, the reflected image of man himself.For every man's conception of God must vary with his mentalcultivation and mental powers. If any one contents himself withany lower image than his intellect is capable of grasping, then hecontents himself with that which is false to him, as well as false infact. If lower than he can reach, he must needs feel it to be false.And if we, of the nineteenth century after Christ, adopt the con-ceptions of the nineteenth century before Him; if our conceptionsof God are those of the ignorant, narrow-minded, and vindictiveIsraelite; then we think worse of God, and have a lower, meaner,and more limited view of His nature, than the faculties which Hehas bestowed are capable of grasping. The highest view we canform is nearest to the truth. If we acquiesce in any lower one,we acquiesce in an untruth. We feel that it is an affront and anindignity to Him, to conceive of Him as cruel, short-sighted, ca-pricious, and unjust; as a jealous, an angry, a vindictive Being.When we examine our conceptions of His character, if we canconceive of a loftier, nobler, higher, more beneficent, glorious, andmagnificent character, then this latter is to us the true conceptionof Deity; for nothing can be imagined more excellent than He.Religion, to obtain currency and influence with the great massof mankind, must needs be alloyed with such an amount of erroras to place it far below the standard attainable by the higherhuman capacities. A religion as pure as the loftiest and most cul-tivated human reason could discern, would not be comprehendedby, or effective over, the less educated portion of mankind. Whatis Truth to the philosopher, would not be Truth, nor have theeffect of Truth, to the peasant. The religion of the many mustnecessarily be more incorrect than that of the refined and reflectivefew, not so much in its essence as in its forms, not so much in thespiritual idea which lies latent at the bottom of it, as in the sym-bols and dogmas in which that idea is embodied. The truestreligion would, in many points, not be comprehended by the igno-rant, nor consolatory to them, nor guiding and supporting forthem. The doctrines of the Bible are often not clothed in thelanguage of strict truth, but in that which was fittest to conveyto a rude and ignorant people the practical essentials of the doc-trine. A perfectly pure faith, free from all extraneous admixtures,a system of noble theism and lofty morality, would find too littlepreparation for it in the common mind and heart, to admit ofprompt reception by the masses of mankind; and Truth mightnot have reached us, if it had not borrowed the wings of Error.The Mason regards God as a Moral Governor, as well as anOriginal Creator; as a God at hand, and not merely one afar offin the distance of infinite space, and in the remoteness of Pastor Future Eternity. He conceives of Him as taking a watchfuland presiding interest in the affairs of the world, and as influenc-ing the hearts and actions of men.To him, God is the great Source of the World of Life and Mat-ter; and man, with his wonderful corporeal and mental frame,His direct work. He believes that God has made men with differ-ent intellectual capacities, and enabled some, by superior intellect-ual power, to see and originate truths which are hidden from themass of men. He believes that when it is His will that mankindshould make some great step forward, or achieve some pregnantdiscovery, He calls into being some intellect of more than ordi-nary magnitude and power, to give birth to new ideas, andgrander conceptions of the Truths vital to Humanity.We hold that God has so ordered matters in this beautiful andharmonious, but mysteriously-governed Universe, that one greatmind after another will arise, from time to time, as such areneeded, to reveal to men the truths that are wanted, and theamount of truth than can be borne. He so arranges, that natureand the course of events shall send men into the world, endowedwith that higher mental and moral organization, in which grandtruths, and sublime gleams of spiritual light will spontaneouslyand inevitably arise. These speak to men by inspiration.Whatever Hiram really was, he is the type, perhaps an imag-inary type, to us, of humanity in its highest phase; an exemplarof what man may and should become, in the course of ages, in hisprogress toward the realization of his destiny; an individual giftedwith a glorious intellect, a noble soul, a fine organization, and aperfectly balanced moral being; an earnest of what humanity maybe, and what we believe it will hereafter be in God's good time;the possibility of the race made real.The Mason believes that God has arranged this glorious but per-plexing world with a purpose, and on a plan. He holds that everyman sent upon this earth, and especially every man of superiorcapacity, has a duty to perform, a mission to fulfill, a baptism tobe baptized with; that every great and good man possesses someportion of God's truth, which he must proclaim to the world, andwhich must bear fruit in his own bosom. In a true and simplesense, he believes all the pure, wise, and intellectual to be inspired,and to be so for the instruction, advancement, and elevation ofmankind. That kind of inspiration, like God's omnipresence, isnot limited to the few writers claimed by Jews, Christians, orMoslems, but is co-extensive with the race. It is the consequenceof a faithful use of our faculties. Each man is its subject, God isits source, and Truth its only test. It differs in degrees, as theintellectual endowments, the moral wealth of the soul, and the de-gree of cultivation of those endowments and faculties differ. It islimited to no sect, age, or nation. It is wide as the world andcommon as God. It was not given to a few men, in the infancyof mankind, to monopolize inspiration, and bar God out of thesoul. We are not born in the dotage and decay of the world. Thestars are beautiful as in their prime; the most ancient Heavensare fresh and strong. God is still everywhere in nature. Wher-ever a heart beats with love, wherever Faith and Reason uttertheir oracles, there is God, as formerly in the hearts of seers andprophets. No soil on earth is so holy as the good man's heart;nothing is so full of God. This inspiration is not given to thelearned alone, not alone to the great and wise, but to every faithfulchild of God. Certain as the open eye drinks in the light, do thepure in heart see God; and he who lives truly, feels Him as a pres-ence within the soul. The conscience is the very voice of Deity.Masonry, around whose altars the Christian, the Hebrew, theMoslem, the Brahmin, the followers of Confucius and Zoroaster,can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer to the one God whois above all the Baalim, must needs leave it to each of its Initiatesto look for the foundation of his faith and hope to the writtenscriptures of his own religion. For itself it finds those truthsdefinite enough, which are written by the finger of God upon theheart of man and on the pages of the book of nature. Views ofreligion and duty, wrought out by the meditations of the studious,confirmed by the allegiance of the good and wise, stamped assterling by the response they find in every uncorrupted mind, com-mend themselves to Masons of every creed, and may well be ac-cepted by all.The Mason does not pretend to dogmatic certainty, nor vainlyimagine such certainty attainable. He considers that if therewere no written revelation, he could safely rest the hopes that ani-mate him and the principles that guide him, on the deductions ofreason and the convictions of instinct and consciousness. He canfind a sure foundation for his religious belief, in these deductionsof the intellect and convictions of the heart. For reason provesto him the existence and attributes of God; and those spiritualinstincts which he feels are the voice of God in his soul, infuseinto his mind a sense of his relation to God, a conviction of thebeneficence of his Creator and Preserver, and a hope of future ex-istence; and his reason and conscience alike unerringly point tovirtue as the highest good, and the destined aim and purpose ofman's life.He studies the wonders of the Heavens, the frame-work andrevolutions of the Earth, the mysterious beauties and adaptationsof animal existence, the moral and material constitution of thehuman creature, so fearfully and wonderfully made; and is satis-fied that God IS; and that a Wise and Good Being is the authorof the starry Heavens above him, and of the moral world withinhim; and his mind finds an adequate foundation for its hopes, itsworship, its principles of action, in the far-stretching Universe, inthe glorious firmament, in the deep, full soul, bursting with un-utterable thoughts.These are truths which every reflecting mind will unhesitatinglyreceive, as not to be surpassed, nor capable of improvement; andfitted, if obeyed, to make earth indeed a Paradise, and man only alittle lower than the angels. The worthlessness of ceremonialobservances, and the necessity of active virtue; the enforcementof purity of heart as the security for purity of life, and of thegovernment of the thoughts, as the originators and forerunners ofaction; universal philanthropy, requiring us to love all men, andto do unto others that and that only which we should think itright, just, and generous for them to do unto us; forgiveness ofinjuries; the necessity of self-sacrifice in the discharge of duty;humility; genuine sincerity, and being that which we seem to be;all these sublime precepts need no miracle, no voice from theclouds, to recommend them to our allegiance, or to assure us oftheir divine origin. They command obedience by virtue of theirinherent rectitude and beauty; and have been, and are, and willbe the law in every age and every country of the world. Godrevealed them to man in the beginning.To the Mason, God is our Father in Heaven, to be Whoseespecial children is the sufficient reward of the peacemakers, to seeWhose face the highest hope of the pure in heart; Who is ever athand to strengthen His true worshippers; to Whom our most fer-vent love is due, our most humble and patient submission; Whosemost acceptable worship is a pure and pitying heart and a benefi-cent life; in Whose constant presence we live and act, to Whosemerciful disposal we are resigned by that death which, we hopeand believe, is but the entrance to a better life; and Whose wisedecrees forbid a man to lap his soul in an elysium of mere indolentcontent.As to our feelings toward Him and our conduct toward man,Masonry teaches little about which men can differ, and little fromwhich they can dissent. He is our Father; and we are all breth-ren. This much lies open to the most ignorant and busy, as fullyas to those who have most leisure and are most learned. Thisneeds no Priest to teach it, and no authority to indorse it; and ifevery man did that only which is consistent with it, it would exilebarbarity, cruelty, intolerance, uncharitableness, perfidy, treach-ery, revenge, selfishness, and all their kindred vices and bad pas-sions beyond the confines of the world.The true Mason, sincerely holding that a Supreme God createdand governs this world, believes also that He governs it by laws,which, though wise, just, and beneficent, are yet steady, unwaver-ing, inexorable. He believes that his agonies and sorrows are or-dained for his chastening, his strengthening, his elaboration anddevelopment; because they are the necessary results of the opera-tion of laws, the best that could be devised for the happiness andpurification of the species, and to give occasion and opportunityfor the practice of all the virtues, from the homeliest and mostcommon, to the noblest and most sublime; or perhaps not eventhat, but the best adapted to work out the vast, awful, glorious,eternal designs of the Great Spirit of the Universe. He believesthat the ordained operations of nature, which have brought miseryto him, have, from the very unswerving tranquility of theircareer, showered blessings and sunshine upon many another path;that the unrelenting chariot of Time, which has crushed or maimedhim in its allotted course, is pressing onward to the accomplish-ment of those serene and mighty purposes, to have contributed towhich, even as a victim, is an honor and a recompense. He takesthis view of Time and Nature and God, and yet bears his lot with-out murmur or distrust; because it is a portion of a system, thebest possible, because ordained by God. He does not believe thatGod loses sight of him, while superintending the march of thegreat harmonies of the Universe; nor that it was not foreseen,when the Universe was created, its laws enacted, and the long suc-cession of its operations pre-ordained, that in the great march ofthose events, he would suffer pain and undergo calamity. He be-lieves that his individual good entered into God's consideration, aswell as the great cardinal results to which the course of all thingsis tending.Thus believing, he has attained an eminence in virtue, the high-est, amid passive excellence, which humanity can reach. He findshis reward and his support in the reflection that he is an unreluc-tant and self-sacrificing co-operator with the Creator of the Uni-verse; and in the noble consciousness of being worthy and capableof so sublime a conception, yet so sad a destiny. He is then trulyentitled to be called a Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.He is content to fall early in the battle, if his body may but forma stepping-stone for the future conquests of humanity.It cannot be that God, Who, we are certain, is perfectly good,can choose us to suffer pain, unless either we are ourselves to re-ceive from it an antidote to what is evil in ourselves, or else assuch pain is a necessary part in the scheme of the Universe, whichas a whole is good. In either case, the Mason receives it withsubmission. He would not suffer unless it was ordered so. What-ever his creed, if he believes that God is, and that He cares forHis creatures, he cannot doubt that; nor that it would not havebeen so ordered, unless it was either better for himself, or forsome other persons, or for some things. To complain and lamentis to murmur against God's will, and worse than unbelief.The Mason, whose mind is cast in a nobler mould than those ofthe ignorant and unreflecting, and is instinct with a diviner life,-who loves truth more than rest, and the peace of Heaven ratherthan the peace of Eden,--to whom a loftier being brings severercares,--who knows that man does not live by pleasure or contentalone, but by the presence of the power of God,--must cast be-hind him the hope of any other repose or tranquillity, than thatwhich is the last reward of long agonies of thought; he must re-linquish all prospect of any Heaven save that of which trouble isthe avenue and portal; he must gird up his loins, and trim hislamp, for a work that must be done, and must not be negligentlydone. If he does not like to live in the furnished lodgings of tra-dition, he must build his own house, his own system of faith andthought, for himself.The hope of success, and not the hope of reward, should be ourstimulating and sustaining power. Our object, and not ourselves,should be our inspiring thought. Selfishness is a sin, when tem-porary, and for time. Spun out to eternity, it does not becomecelestial prudence. We should toil and die, not for Heaven orBliss, but for Duty.In the more frequent cases, where we have to join our efforts tothose of thousands of others, to contribute to the carrying forwardof a great cause; merely to till the ground or sow the seed for avery distant harvest, or to prepare the way for the future adventof some great amendment; the amount which each one contrib-utes to the achievement of ultimate success, the portion of theprice which justice should assign to each as his especial produc-tion, can never be accurately ascertained. Perhaps few of thosewho have ever labored, in the patience of secrecy and silence, tobring about some political or social change, which they felt con-vinced would ultimately prove of vast service to humanity, livedto see the change effected, or the anticipated good flow from it.Fewer still of them were able to pronounce what appreciableweight their several efforts contributed to the achievement of thechange desired. Many will doubt, whether, in truth, these exer-tions have any influence whatever; and, discouraged, cease allactive effort.Not to be thus discouraged, the Mason must labor to elevateand purify his motives, as well as sedulously cherish the convic-tion, assuredly a true one, that in this world there is no such thingas effort thrown away; that in all labor there is profit; that allsincere exertion, in a righteous and unselfish cause, is necessarilyfollowed, in spite of all appearance to the contrary, by an appro-priate and proportionate success; that no bread cast upon thewaters can be wholly lost; that no seed planted in the ground canfail to quicken in due time and measure; and that, however wemay, in moments of despondency, be apt to doubt, not onlywhether our cause will triumph, but whether, if it does, we shallhave contributed to its triumph,--there is One, Who has notonly seen every exertion we have made, but Who can assignthe exact degree in which each soldier has assisted to gain thegreat victory over social evil. No good work is done wholly invain.The Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason will in nowisedeserve that honorable title, if he has not that strength, that will,that self-sustaining energy; that Faith, that feeds upon no earthlyhope, nor ever thinks of victory, but, content in its own consum-mation, combats, because it ought to combat, rejoicing fights, andstill rejoicing falls.The Augean Stables of the World, the accumulated uncleannessand misery of centuries, require a mighty river to cleanse themthoroughly away; every drop we contribute aids to swell thatriver and augment its force, in a degree appreciable by God,though not by man; and he whose zeal is deep and earnest, willnot be over-anxious that his individual drops should be distin-guishable amid the mighty mass of cleansing and fertilizingwaters; far less that, for the sake of distinction, it should flow inineffective singleness away.The true Mason will not be careful that his name should beinscribed upon the mite which he casts into the treasury of God.It suffices him to know that if he has labored, with purity of pur-pose, in any good cause, he must have contributed to its success;that the degree in which he has contributed is a matter of infi-nitely small concern; and still more, that the consciousness ofhaving so contributed, however obscurely and unnoticed, is hissufficient, even if it be his sole, reward. Let every Grand Elect,Perfect, and Sublime Mason cherish this faith. It is a duty. Itis the brilliant and never-dying light that shines within andthrough the symbolic pedestal of alabaster, on which reposes theperfect cube of agate, symbol of duty, inscribed with the divinename of God. He who industriously sows and reaps is a goodlaborer, and worthy of his hire. But he who sows that whichshall be reaped by others, by those who will know not of and carenot for the sower, is a laborer of a nobler order, and, worthy of amore excellent reward.The Mason does not exhort others to an ascetic undervaluingof this life, as an insignificant and unworthy portion of existence;for that demands feelings which are unnatural, and which, there-fore, if attained, must be morbid, and if merely professed, insin-cere; and teaches us to look rather to a future life for the com-pensation of social evils, than to this life for their cure; and sodoes injury to the cause of virtue and to that of social progress.Life is real, and is earnest, and it is full of duties to be performed.It is the beginning of our immortality. Those only who feel adeep interest and affection for this world will work resolutely forits amelioration; those whose affections are transferred to Heaven,easily acquiesce in the miseries of earth, deeming them hopeless,befitting, and ordained; and console themselves with the idea ofthe ammends which are one day to be theirs. It is a sad truth, thatthose most decidedly given to spiritual contemplation, and tomaking religion rule in their hearts, are often most apathetic to-ward all improvement of this world's systems, and in many casesvirtual conservatives of evil, and hostile to political and social re-form, as diverting men's energies from eternity.The Mason does not war with his own instincts, macerate thebody into weakness and disorder, and disparage what he sees to bebeautiful, knows to be wonderful, and feels to be unspeakablydear and fascinating. He does not put aside the nature whichGod has given him, to struggle after one which He has not be-stowed. He knows that man is sent into the world, not a spir-itual, but a composite being, made up of body and mind, the bodyhaving, as is fit and needful in a material world, its full, rightful,and allotted share. His life is guided by a full recognition of thisfact. He does not deny it in bold words, and admit it in weak-nesses and inevitable failings. He believes that his spiritualitywill come in the next stage of his being, when he puts on the spir-itual body; that his body will be dropped at death; and that, untilthen, God meant it to be commanded and controlled, but not neg-lected, despised, or ignored by the soul, under pain of heavy con-sequences. Yet the Mason is not indifferent as to the fate of the soul, afterits present life, as to its continued and eternal being, and the char-acter of the scenes in which that being will be fully developed.These are to him topics of the proroundest interest, and the mostennobling and refining contemplation. They occupy much of hisleisure; and as he becomes familiar with the sorrows and calami-ties of this life, as his hopes are disappointed and his visions ofhappiness here fade away; when life has wearied him in itsrace of hours; when he is harassed and toil-worn, and the bur-den of his years weighs heavy on him, the balance of attractiongradually inclines in favor of another life; and he clings to hislofty speculations with a tenacity of interest which needs no in-junction, and will listen to no prohibition. They are the consol-ing privilege of the aspiring, the wayworn, the weary, and thebereaved.To him the contemplation of the Future lets in light upon thePresent, and develops the higher portions of his nature. He en-deavors rightly to adjust the respective claims of Heaven andearth upon his time and thought, so as to give the proper propor-tions thereof to performing the duties and entering into the inter-ests of this world, and to preparation for a better; to the cultiva-tion and purification of his own character, and to the public serviceof his fellow-men.The Mason does not dogmatize, but entertaining and utteringhis own convictions, he leaves every one else free to do the same;and only hopes that the time will come, even if after the lapse ofages, when all men shall form one great family of brethren, andone law alone, the law of love, shall govern God's whole Uni-verse.Believe as you may, my brother; if the Universe is not, to you,without a God, and if man is not like the beast that perishes, buthath an immortal soul, we welcome you among us, to wear, as wewear, with humility, and conscious of your demerits and short-comings, the title of Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.It is not without a secret meaning, that twelve was the num-ber of the Apostles of Christ, and seventy-two that of his Dis-ciples: that John addressed his rebukes and menaces to the Sevenchurches, the number of the Archangels and the Planets. AtBabylon were the Seven Stages of Bersippa, a pyramid of Sevenstories, and at Ecbatana Seven concentric inclosures, each of adifferent color. Thebes also had Seven gates, and the same num-ber is repeated again and again in the account of the flood. TheSephiroth, or Emanations, ten in number, three in one class, andseven in the other, repeat the mystic numbers of Pythagoras.Seven Amschaspands or planetary spirits were invoked withOrmuzd: Seven inferior Rishis of Hindustan were saved with thehead of their family in an ark: and Seven ancient personagesalone returned with the British just man, Hu, from the dale ofthe grievous waters. There were Seven Heliadae, whose fatherHelias, or the Sun, once crossed the sea in a golden cup; SevenTitans, children of the older Titan, Kronos or Saturn; SevenCorybantes; and Seven Cabiri, sons of Sydyk; Seven primevalCelestial spirits of the Japanese, and Seven Karlesters whoescaped from the deluge and began to be the parents of a newrace, on the summit of Mount Albordi. Seven Cyclopes, also,built the walls of Tiryus.Celus, as quoted by Origen, tells us that the Persians repre-sented by symbols the two-fold motion of the stars, fixed andplanetary, and the passage of the Soul through their successivespheres. They erected in their holy caves, in which the mysticrites of the Mithriac Initiations were practised, what he denomi-nates a high ladder, on the Seven steps of which were Sevengates or portals, according to the number of the Seven principalheavenly bodies. Through these the aspirants passed, until theyreached the summit of the whole; and this passage was styled atransmigration through the spheres.Jacob saw in his dream a ladder planted or set on the earth,and its top reaching to Heaven, and the Malaki Alohim ascendingand descending on it, and above it stood IHUH, declaring Himselfto be Ihuh-Alhi Abraham. The word translated ladder, isSalam, from Salal, raised, elevated, reared up, exalted, piledup into a heap, Aggeravit. Salalah, means a heap, rampart,or other accumulation of earth or stone, artificially made; andSalaa or Salo, is a rock or cliff or boulder, and the name ofthe city of Petra. There is no ancient Hebrew word to designatea pyramid.The symbolic mountain Meru was ascended by Seven steps orstages; and all the pyramids and artificial tumuli and hillocksthrown up in flat countries were imitations of this fabulous andmystic mountain, for purposes of worship. These were the "HighPlaces" so often mentioned in the Hebrew books, on which theidolaters sacrificed to foreign gods.The pyramids were sometimes square, and sometimes round.The sacred Babylonian tower [Magdol], dedicated to thegreat Father Bal, was an artificial hill, of pyramidal shape, andSeven stages, built of brick, and each stage of a different color,representing the Seven planetary spheres by the appropriate colorof each planet. Meru itself was said to be a single mountain, ter-minating in three peaks, and thus a symbol of the Trimurti. Thegreat Pagoda at Tanjore was of six stories, surmounted by a tem-ple as the seventh, and on this three spires or towers. An ancientpagoda at Deogur was surmounted by a tower, sustaining themystic egg and a trident. Herodotus tells us that the Temple ofBal at Babylon was a tower composed of Seven towers, resting onan eighth that served as basis, and successively diminishing insize from the bottom to the top; and Strabo tells us it was apyramid.Faber thinks that the Mithriac ladder was really a pyramid withSeven stages, each provided with a narrow door or aperture,through each of which doors the aspirant passed, to reach thesummit, and then descended through similar doors on the oppositeside of the pyramid; the ascent and descent of the Soul beingthus represented.Each Mithriac cave and all the most ancient temples weretended to symbolize the Universe, which itself was habituallycalled the Temple and habitation of Deity. Every temple wasthe world in miniature; and so the whole world was one grandtemple. The most ancient temples were roofless; and thereforethe Persians, Celts, and Scythians strongly disliked artificial cov-ered edifices. Cicero says that Xerxes burned the Grecian tem-ples, on the express ground that the whole world was the Magnifi-cent Temple and Habitation of the Supreme Deity. Macrobiussays that the entire Universe was judiciously deemed by many theTemple of God. Plato pronounced the real Temple of the Deityto be the world; and Heraclitus declared that the Universe, varie-gated with animals and plants and stars was the only genuineTemple of the Divinity.How completely the Temple of Solomon was symbolic, ismanifest, not only from the continual reproduction in it ofthe sacred numbers and of astrological symbols in the histor-ical descriptions of it; but also, and yet more, from the de-tails of the imaginary reconstructed edifice, seen by Ezekielin his vision. The Apocalypse completes the demonstration,and shows the kabalistic meanings of the whole. The Sym-bola Architectonica are found on the most ancient edifices;and these mathematical figures and instruments, adopted bythe Templars, and identical with those on the gnostic seals andabraxae, connect their dogma with the Chaldaic, Syriac, andEgyptian Oriental philosophy. The secret Pythagorean doc-trines of numbers were preserved by the monks of Thibet, bythe Hierophants of Egypt and Eleusis, at Jerusalem, and inthe circular Chapters of the Druids; and they are especiallyconsecrated in that mysterious book, the Apocalypse of SaintJohn.All temples were surrounded by pillars, recording the numberof the constellations, the signs of the zodiac, or the cycles of theplanets; and each one was a microcosm or symbol of the Universe,having for roof or ceiling the starred vault of Heaven.All temples were originally open at the top, having for roof thesky. Twelve pillars described the belt of the zodiac. Whateverthe number of the pillars, they were mystical everywhere. AtAbury, the Druidic temple reproduced all the cycles by its col-umns. Around the temples of Chilminar in Persia, of Baalbec,and of Tukhti Schlomoh in Tartary, on the frontier of China,stood forty pillars. On each side of the temple at Paestum werefourteen, recording the Egyptian cycle of the dark and light sidesof the moon, as described by Plutarch; the whole thirty-eightthat surrounded them recording the two meteoric cycles so oftenfound in the Druidic temples.The theatre built by Scaurus, in Greece, was surrounded by360 columns; the Temple at Mecca, and that at Iona in Scotland,by 360 stones.

XI. SUBLIME ELECT OF THE TWELVEORPRINCE AMETH.[Elu of the Twelve.]The duties of a Prince Ameth are, to be earnest, true, reliable, andsincere; to protect the people against illegal impositions and exactions; tocontend for their political rights, and to see, as far as he may or can, thatthose bear the burdens who reap the benefits of the Government.You are to be true unto all men.You are to be frank and sincere in all things.You are to be earnest in doing whatever it is your duty to do.And no man must repent that he has relied upon your resolve, yourprofession, or your word.The great distinguishing characteristic of a Mason is sympathy with hiskind. He recognizes in the human race one great family, all connectedwith himself by those invisible links, and that mighty net-work ofcircumstance, forged and woven by God.Feeling that sympathy, it is his first Masonic duty to serve his fellow-man.At his first entrance into the Order, he ceases to be isolated, andbecomes one of a great brotherhood, assuming now duties toward everyMason that lives, as every Mason at the same moment assumes themtoward him.Nor are those duties on his part confined to Masons alone. He assumesmany in regard to his country, and especially toward the great, sufferingmasses of the common people; for they too are his brethren, and Godhears them, inarticulate as the moanings of their misery are. By all propermeans, of persuasion and influence, and otherwise, if the occasion and emergency require, he is bound to defend them against oppression, and tyrannical and illegal exactions.He labors equally to defend and to improve the people. He does notflatter them to mislead them, nor fawn upon them to rule them, norconceal his opinions to humor them, nor tell them that they can never err,and that their voice is the voice of God. He knows that the safety of everyfree government, and its continuance and perpetuity depend upon thevirtue and intelligence of the common people; and that, unless their libertyis of such a kind as arms can neither procure nor take away; unless it isthe fruit of manly courage, of justice, temperance, and generous virtue -unless, being such, it has taken deep root in the minds and hearts of thepeople at large, there will not long be wanting those who will snatch fromthem by treachery what they have acquired by arms or institutions.He knows that if, after being released from the toils of war, the peopleneglect the arts of peace; if their peace and liberty be a state of warfare; ifwar be their only virtue, and the summit of their praise, they will soon findpeace the most adverse to their interests. It will be only a moredistressing war; and that which they imagined liberty will be the worst ofslavery. For, unless by the means of knowledge and morality, not frothyand loquacious, but genuine, unadulterated, and sincere, they clear thehorizon of the mind from those mists of error and passion which arise fromignorance and vice, they will always have those who will bend their necksto the yoke as if they were brutes; who, notwithstanding all their triumphs,will put them up to the highest bidder, as if they were mere booty made inwar; and find an exuberant source of wealth and power, in the people'signorance, prejudice, and passions.The people that does not subjugate the propensity of the wealthy toavarice, ambition, and sensuality, expel luxury from them and theirfamilies, keep down pauperism, diffuse knowledge among the poor, andlabor to raise the abject from the mire of vice and low indulgence, and tokeep the industrious from starving in sight of luxurious festivals, will findthat it has cherished, in that avarice, ambition, sensuality, selfishness,and luxury of the one class, and that degradation, misery, drunkenness,ignorance, and brutalization of the other, more stubborn and intractabledespots at home than it ever encountered in the field; and even its very bowels will be continually teeming with the intolerable progeny of tyrants.These are the first enemies to be subdued; this constitutes the campaignof Peace; these are triumphs, difficult indeed, but bloodless; and far morehonorable than those trophies which are purchased only by slaughter andrapine; and if not victors in this service, it is in vain to have beenvictorious over the despotic enemy in the field.For if any people thinks that it is a grander; a more beneficial, or a wiserpolicy, to invent subtle expedients by stamps and imposts, for increasingthe revenue and draining the life-blood of an impoverished people; tomultiply its naval and military force; to rival in craft the ambassadors offoreign states; to plot the swallowing up of foreign territory; to make craftytreaties and alliances; to rule prostrate states and abject provinces by fearand force; than to administer unpolluted justice to the people, to relievethe condition and raise the estate of the toiling masses, redress theinjured and succor the distressed and conciliate the discontented, andspeedily restore to every one his own; then that people is involved in acloud of error, and will too late perceive, when the illusion of these mightybenefits has vanished, that in neglecting these, which it thought inferiorconsiderations, it has only been precipitating its own ruin and despair.Unfortunately, every age presents its own special problem, most difficultand often impossible to solve; and that which this age offers, and forcesupon the consideration of all chinking men, is this - how, in a populousand wealthy country, blessed with free institutions and a constitutionalgovernment, are the great masses of the manual-labor class to beenabled to have steady work at fair wages, to be kept from starvation, andtheir children from vice and debauchery, and to be furnished with thatdegree, not of mere reading and writing, but of knowledge, that shall fitthem intelligently to do the duties and exercise the privileges of freemen;even to be intrusted with the dangerous right of suffrage?For though we do not know why God, being infinitely merciful as well aswise, has so ordered it, it seems to be unquestionably his law, that evenin civilized and Christian countries, the large mass of the population shallbe fortunate, if, during their whole life, from infancy to old age, in healthand sickness, they have enough of the commonest and coarsest food tokeep themselves and theirchildren from the continual gnawing of hunger - enough of the commonestand coarsest clothing to protect themselves and their little ones fromindecent exposure and the bitter cold; and if they have over their headsthe rudest shelter.And He seems to have enacted this law - which no human community hasyet found the means to abrogate - that when a country becomespopulous, capital shall concentrate in the hands of a limited number ofpersons, and labor become more and more at its mercy, until meremanual labor, that of the weaver and ironworker, and other artisans,eventually ceases to be worth more than a bare subsistence, and often, ingreat cities and vast extents of country not even that, and goes or crawlsabout in rags, begging, and starving for want of work.While every ox and horse can find work, and is worth being fed, it is notalways so with man. To be employed, to have a chance to work atanything like fair wages, becomes the great engrossing object of a man'slife. The capitalist can live without employing the laborer, and dischargeshim whenever that labor ceases to be profitable. At the moment when theweather is most inclement, provisions dearest, and rents highest, he turnshim off to starve. If the day-laborer is taken sick, his wages stop. Whenold, he has no pension to retire upon. His children cannot be sent toschool; for before their bones are hardened they must get to work lestthey starve. The man, strong and able-bodied, works for a shilling or twoa day, and the woman shivering over her little pan of coals, when themercury drops far below zero, after her hungry children have wailedthemselves to sleep, sews by the dim light of her lonely candle, for a barepittance, selling her life to him who bargained only for the work of herneedle.Fathers and mothers slay their children, to have the burial-fees, that withthe price of one child's life they may continue life in those that survive.Little girls with bare feet sweep the street-crossings, when the winter windpinches them, and beg piteously for pennies of those who wear warmfurs. Children grow up in squalid misery and brutal ignorance; wantcompels virgin and wife to prostitute themselves; women starve andfreeze, and lean up against the walls of workhouses, like bundles of foulrags, all night long, and night after night, when the cold rain falls, andthere chances to be no room for them within; and hundreds of families arecrowded into a single building, rife with horrors and teemingwith foul air and pestilence; where men, women and children huddle togetherin their filth; all ages and all colors sleeping indiscriminately together; while, ina great, free, Republican State, in the full vigor of its youth and strength, oneperson in every seventeen is a pauper receiving charity.How to deal with this apparently inevitable evil and mortal disease is by far themost important of all social problems. What is to be done with pauperism andover-supply of labor? How is the life of any country to last, when brutality anddrunken semi-barbarism vote, and hold offices in their gift, and by fitrepresentatives of themselves control a government? How, if not wisdom andauthority, but turbulence and low vice are to exalt to senatorships miscreantsreeking with the odors and pollution of the hell, the prize-ring, the brothel, andthe stock-exchange, where gambling is legalized and rascality is laudable?Masonry will do all in its power, by direct exertion and cooperation, to improveand inform as well as to protect the people; to better their physical condition,relieve their miseries, supply their wants, and minister to their necessities. Letevery Mason in this good work do all that may be in his power.For it is true now, as it always was and always will be, that to be free is thesame thing as to be pious, to be wise, to be temperate and just, to be frugaland abstinent, and to be magnanimous and brave; and to be the opposite of allthese is the same as to be a slave. And it usually happens, by theappointment, and, as it were, retributive justice of the Deity, that that peoplewhich cannot govern themselves, and moderate their passions, but crouchunder the slavery of their lusts and vices, are delivered up to the sway of thosewhom they abhor, and made to submit to an involuntary servitude.And it is also sanctioned by the dictates of justice and by the constitution ofNature, that he who, from the imbecility or derangement of his intellect, isincapable of governing himself, should, like a minor, be committed to thegovernment of another.Above all things let us never forget that mankind constitutes one greatbrotherhood; all born to encounter suffering and sorrow, and therefore boundto sympathize with each other.For no tower of Pride was ever yet high enough to lift its possessor above thetrials and fears and frailities of humanity. No human hand ever built the wall,nor ever shall, that will keep outaffliction, pain, and infirmity. Sickness and sorrow, trouble and death, aredispensations that level everything. They know none, high nor low. Thechief wants of life, the great and grave necessities of the human soul, giveexemption to none. They make all poor, all weak. They put supplication inthe mouth of every human being, as truly as in that of the meanestbeggar.But the principle of misery is not an evil principle. We err, and theconsequences teach us wisdom. All elements, all the laws of thingsaround us, minister to this end; and through the paths of painful error andmistake, it is the design of Providence to lead us to truth and happiness. Iferring only taught us to err; if mistakes confirmed us in imprudence; if themiseries caused by vicious indulgence had a natural tendency to make usmore abject slaves of vice, then suffering would be wholly evil. But, on thecontrary, all tends and is designed to produce amendment andimprovement. Suffering is the discipline of virtue; of that which is infinitelybetter than happiness, and yet embraces in itself all essential happiness.It nourishes, invigorates, and perfects it. Virtue is the prize of theseverely-contested race and hard-fought battle; and it is worth all thefatigue and wounds of the conflict. Man should go forth with a brave andstrong heart, to battle with calamity. He is to master it, and not let itbecome his master. He is not to forsake the post of trial and of peril; but tostand firmly in his lot, until the great word of Providence shall bid him fly,or bid him sink. With resolution and courage the Mason is to do the workwhich it is appointed for him to do, looking through the dark cloud ofhuman calamity, to the end that rises high and bright before him. The lotof sorrow is great and sublime. None suffer forever, nor for nought, norwithout purpose. It is the ordinance of God's wisdom, and of His InfiniteLove, to procure for us infinite happiness and glory.Virtue is the truest liberty; nor is he free who stoops to passions; nor he inbondage who serves a noble master. Examples are the best and mostlasting lectures; virtue the best example. He that hath done good deedsand set good precedents, in sincerity, is happy. Time shall not outlive hisworth. He lives truly after death, whose good deeds are his pillars ofremembrance; and no day but adds some grains to his heap of glory.Good works are seeds, that after sowing return us a continual harvest;and the memory of noble actions is more enduring than monuments ofmarble.Life is a school. The world is neither prison nor penitentiary, nor a palaceof ease, nor an amphitheatre for games and spectacles; but a place ofinstruction, and discipline. Life is given for moral and spiritual training;and the entire course of the great school of life is an education for virtue,happiness, and a future existence. The periods of Life are its terms; allhuman conditions, its forms; all human employments, its lessons. Familiesare the primary departments of this moral education; the various circles ofsociety, its advanced stages; Kingdoms and Republics, its universities.Riches and Poverty, Gayeties and Sorrows, Marriages and Funerals, theties of life bound or broken, fit and fortunate, or untoward and painful, areall lessons. Events are not blindly and carelessly flung together.Providence does not school one man, and screen another from the fierytrial of its lessons. It has neither rich favorites nor poor victims. One eventhappeneth to all. One end and one design concern and urge all men.The prosperous man has been at school. Perhaps he has thought that itwas a great thing, and he a great personage; but he has been merely apupil. He thought, perhaps, that he was Master, and had nothing to do,but to direct and command; but there was ever a Master above him, theMaster of Life. He looks not at our splendid state, or our manypretensions, nor at the aids and appliances of our learning; but at ourlearning itself. He puts the poor and the rich upon the same form; andknows no difference between them, but their progress.If from prosperity we have learned moderation, temperance, candor,modesty, gratitude to God, and generosity to man, then we are entitled tobe honored and rewarded. If we have learned selfishness, selfindulgence,wrong-doing, and vice, to forget and overlook our lessfortunate brother, and to scoff at the providence of God, then we areunworthy and dishonored, though we have been nursed in affluence, ortaken our degrees from the lineage of an hundred noble descents; as trulyso, in the eye of Heaven, and of all right-thinking men, as though we lay,victims of beggary and disease, in the hospital, by the hedge, or on thedung-hill. The most ordinary human equity looks not at the school, but atthe scholar; and the equity of Heaven will not look beneath that mark.The poor man also is at school. Let him take care that helearn, rather than complain. Let him hold to his integrity, his candor, andhis kindness of heart. Let him beware of envy, and of bondage, and keephis self-respect. The body's toil is nothing. Let him beware of the mind'sdrudgery and degradation. While he betters his condition if he can, lethim be more anxious to better his soul. Let him be willing, while poor, andeven if always poor, to learn poverty's great lessons, fortitude,cheerfulness, contentment, and implicit confidence in God's Providence.With these, and patience, calmness, self-command, disinterestedness,and affectionate kindness, the humble dwelling may be hallowed, andmade more dear and noble than the loftiest palace. Let him, above allthings, see that he lose not his independence. Let him not cast himself, acreature poorer than the poor, an indolent, helpless, despised beggar, oftthe kindness of others. Every man should choose to have God for hisMaster, rather than man; and escape not from this school, either bydishonesty or alms-taking, lest he fall into that state, worse than disgrace,where he can have no respect for himself.The ties of Society teach us to love one another. That is a miserablesociety, where the absence of affectionate kindness is sought to besupplied by punctilious decorum, graceful urbanity, and polishedinsincerity; where ambition, jealousy, and distrust rule, in place ofsimplicity, confidence, and kindness.So, too, the social state teaches modesty and gentleness; and fromneglect, and notice unworthily bestowed on others, and injustice, and theworld's failure to appreciate us, we learn patience and quietness, to besuperior to society's opinion, not cynical and bitter, but gentle, candid,and affectionate still.Death is the great Teacher, stern, cold, inexorable, irresistible; whom thecollected might of the world cannot stay or ward off. The breath, thatparting from the lips of King or beggar, scarcely stirs the hushed air,cannot be bought, or brought back for a moment, with the wealth ofEmpires. What a lesson is this, teaching our frailty and feebleness, andan Infinite Power beyond us! It is a fearful lesson, that never becomesfamiliar. It walks through the earth in dread mystery, and lays it handsupon all. It is a universal lesson, that is read everywhere and by all men.Its message comes every year and every day. The past years arecrowded with its sad and solemn mementoes; and death's finger traces itshandwriting upon the walls of every human habitation.It teaches us Duty; to act our part well; to fulfill the work assigned us.When one is dying, and after he is dead, there is but one question: Hashe lived well? There is no evil in death but that which life makes.There are hard lessons in the school of God's Providence; and yet theschool of life is carefully adjusted, in all its arrangements and tasks, toman's powers and passions. There is no extravagance in its teachings;nor is anything done for 'the sake of present effect. The whole course ofhuman life is a conflict with difficulties; and, if rightly conducted, aprogress in improvement. It is never too late for man to learn. Not partonly, but the whole, of life is a school. There never comes a time, evenamidst the decays of age, when it is fit to lay aside the eagerness ofacquisition, or the cheerfulness of endeavor. Man walks, all through thecourse of life, in patience and strife, and sometimes in darkness; for, frompatience is to come perfection; from strife, triumph is to issue; from thecloud of darkness the lightning is to flash that shall open the way toeternity.Let the Mason be faithful in the school of life, and to all its lessons! Lethim not learn nothing, nor care not whether he learns or not. Let not theyears pass over him, witnesses of only his sloth and indifference; or seehim zealous to acquire everything but virtue. Nor let him labor only forhimself; nor forget that the humblest man that lives is his brother, andhath a claim on his sympathies and kind offices; and that beneath therough garments which labor wears may beat hearts as noble as throbunder the stars of princes.God, who counts by souls, not stations,Loves and pities you and me;For to Him all vain distinctionsAre as pebbles on the sea.Nor are the other duties inculcated in this Degree of less importance.Truth, a Mason is early told, is a Divine attribute and the foundation ofevery virtue; and frankness, reliability, sincerity, straightforwardness,plain-dealing, are but different modes in which Truth develops itself. Thedead, the absent, the innocent, and those that trust him, no Mason willdeceive willingly. To all these he owes a nobler justice, in that they arethe most certain trials of human Equity. Only the most abandoned of men,said Cicero, will deceive him, who would have remained uninjured if he had nottrusted. All the noble deeds that have beat their marches throughsucceeding ages have proceeded from men of truth and genuine courage.The man who is always true is both virtuous and wise; and thus possessesthe greatest guards of safety: for the law has not power to strike thevirtuous; nor can fortune subvert the wise.The bases of Masonry being morality and virtue, it is by studying one andpractising the other, that the conduct of a Mason becomes irreproachable.The good of Humanity being its principal object, disinterestedness is one ofthe first virtues that it requires of its members; for that is the source ofjustice and beneficence.To pity the misfortunes of others; to be humble, but without meanness; tobe proud, but without arrogance; to abjure every sentiment of hatred andrevenge; to show himself magnanimous and liberal, without ostentation andwithout profusion; to be the enemy of vice; to pay homage to wisdom andvirtue; to respect innocence; to be constant and patient in adversity, andmodest in prosperity; to avoid every irregularity that stains the soul anddistempers the body - it is by following these precepts that a Mason willbecome a good citizen, a faithful husband, a tender father, an obedient son,and a true brother; will honor friendship, and fulfill with ardor the dutieswhich virtue and the social relations impose upon him.It is because Masonry imposes upon us these duties that it is properly andsignificantly styled work; and he who imagines that he becomes a Mason bymerely taking the first two or three Degrees, and that he may, havingleisurely stepped upon that small elevation, thenceforward worthily wearthe honors of Masonry, without labor or exertion, or self-denial or sacrifice,and that there is nothing to be done in Masonry, is strangely deceived.Is it true that nothing remains to be done in Masonry?Does one Brother no longer proceed by law against another Brother of hisLodge, in regard to matters that could be easily settled within the Masonicfamily circle?Has the duel, that hideous heritage of barbarism, interdicted amongBrethren by our fundamental laws, and denounced by the municipal code,yet disappeared from the soil we inhabit? Do Masons of high rankreligiously refrain from it; or do they not,bowing to a corrupt public opinion, submit to its arbitrament, despite thescandal which it occasions to the Order, and in violation of the feeblerestraint of their oath?Do Masons no longer form uncharitable opinions of their Brethren, enterharsh judgments against them, and judge themselves by one rule and theirBrethren by another?Has Masonry any well-regulated system of charity? Has it done that which itshould have done for the cause of education? Where are its schools, itsacademies, its colleges, its hospitals, and infirmaries?Are political controversies now conducted with no violence and bitterness?Do Masons refrain from defaming and denouncing their Brethren who differwith them in religious or political opinions?What grand social problems or useful projects engage our attention at ourcommunications? Where in our Lodges are lectures habitually delivered forthe real instruction of the Brethren? Do not our sessions pass in thediscussion of minor matters of business, the settlement of points of orderand questions of mere administration, and the admission and advancementof Candidates, whom after their admission we take no pains to instruct?In what Lodge are our ceremonies explained and elucidated; corrupted asthey are by time, until their true features can scarcely be distinguished; andwhere are those great primitive truths of revelation taught, which Masonryhas preserved to the world?We have high dignities and sounding titles. Do their possessors qualifythemselves to enlighten the world in respect to the aims and objects ofMasonry? Descendants of those Initiates who governed empires, does yourinfluence enter into practical life and operate efficiently in behalf of wellregulatedand constitutional liberty?Your debates should be but friendly conversations. You need concord,union, and peace. Why then do you retain among you men who exciterivalries and jealousies; why permit great and violent controversy andambitious pretensions'? Now do your own words and acts agree? If yourMasonry is a nullity, how can you exercise any influence on others?Continually you praise each other, and utter elaborate and highwrought eulogies upon the Order. Everywhere you assume that you arewhat you should be, and nowhere do you look upon yourselves as youare. Is it true that all our actions are so many acts of homage to virtue?Explore the recesses of your hearts; let us examine ourselves with animpartial eye, and make answer to our own questioning! Can we bear toourselves the consoling testimony that we always rigidly perform ourduties; that we even half perform them?Let us away with this odious self-flattery! Let us be men, if we cannot besages! The laws of Masonry, above others excellent, cannot whollychange men's natures. They enlighten them, they point out the true way;but they can lead them in it, only by repressing the fire of their passions,and subjugating their selfishness. Alas, these conquer, and Masonry isforgotten!After praising each other all our lives, there are always excellent Brethren,who, over our coffins, shower unlimited eulogies. Every one of us whodies, however useless his life, has been a model of all the virtues, a verychild of the celestial light. In Egypt, among our old Masters, whereMasonry was more cultivated than vanity, no one could gain admittance tothe sacred asylum of the tomb until he had passed under the most solemnjudgment. A grave tribunal sat in judgment upon all, even the kings. Theysaid to the dead, "Whoever thou art, give account to thy country of thyactions! What hast thou done with thy time and life? The law interrogatesthee, thy country hears thee, Truth sits in judgment on thee!" Princescame there to be judged, escorted only by their virtues and their vices. Apublic accuser recounted the history of the dead man's life, and threw theblaze of the torch of truth on all his actions. If it were adjudged that hehad led an evil life, his memory was condemned in the presence of thenation, and his body was denied the honors of sepulture. What a lessonthe old Masonry taught to the sons of the people!Is it true that Masonry is effete; that the acacia, withered, affords noshade; that Masonry no longer marches in the advance-guard of Truth?No. Is freedom yet universal? Have ignorance and prejudice disappearedfrom the earth? Are there no longer enmities among men? Do cupidityand falsehood no longer exist? Do toleration and harmony prevail amongreligious and political sects? There are works yet left for Masonry toaccomplish, greater than the twelve labors of Hercules: to advance everresolutely and steadily; to enlighten the minds of the people, toreconstruct society, to reform the laws, and to improve the public morals.The eternity in front of it is as infinite as the one behind. And Masonrycannot cease to labor in the cause of social progress, without ceasing tobe true to itself, Masonry.
XII. GRAND MASTER ARCHITECT. [Master Architect.] THE great duties that are inculcated by the lessons taught by the workinginstruments of a Grand Master Architect, demanding so much of us, and taking for granted the capacity to perform them faithfully and fully, bring us at once to reflect upon the dignity of human nature, and the vast powers and capacities of the human soul; and to that theme we invite your attention in this Degree. Let us begin to rise from earth toward the Stars. Evermore the human soul struggles toward the light, toward God, and the Infinite. It is especially so in its afflictions. Words go but a little way into the depths of sorrow. The thoughts that writhe there in silence, that go into the stillness of Infinitude and Eternity, have no emblems. Thoughts enough come there, such as no tongue ever uttered. They do not so much want human sympathy, as higher help. There is a loneliness in deep sorrow which the Deity alone can relieve. Alone, the mind wrestles with the great problem of calamity, and seeks the solution from the Infinite Providence of Heaven, and thus is led directly to God. There are many things in us of which we are not distinctly conscious. To waken that slumbering consciousness into life, and so to lead the soul up to the Light, is one office of every great ministration to human nature, whether its vehicle be the pen, the pencil, or the tongue. We are unconscious of the intensity and awfulness of the life within us. Health and sickness, joy and sorrow, success and disappointment, life and death, love and loss, are familiar words upon our lips; and we do not know to what depths they point within us. We seem never to know what any thing means or is worth until we have lost it. Many an organ, nerve, and fibre in our bodily frame performs its silent part for years, and we are quite unconscious of its value. It is not until it is injured that we discover that value, and find how essential it was to our happiness and comfort. We never know the full significance of the words “property," "ease," and "health;" the wealth of meaning in the fond epithets, "parent,” “child," "beloved," and "friend," until the thing or the person is taken away; until, in place of the bright, visible being, comes the awful and desolate shadow, where nothing is: where we stretch out our hands in vain, and strain our eyes upon dark and dismal vacuity. Yet, in that vacuity, we do not lose the object that we loved. It becomes only the more real to us. Our blessings not only brighten when they depart, but are fixed in enduring reality; and love and friendship receive their everlasting seal under the cold impress of death. A dim consciousness of infinite mystery and grandeur lies beneath all the commonplace of life. There is an awfulness and a majesty around us, in all our little worldliness. The rude peasant from the Apennines, asleep at the foot of a pillar in a majestic Roman church, seems not to hear or see, but to, dream only of the herd he feeds or the ground he tills in the mountains. But the choral symphonies fall softly upon his ear, and the gilded arches are dimly seen through his half-slumbering eyelids. So the soul, however given up to the occupations of daily life, cannot quite lose the sense of where it is, and of what is above it and around it. The scene of its actual engagements may be small; the path of its steps, beaten and familiar; the objects it handles, easily spanned, and quite worn out with daily uses. So it may be, and amidst such things that we all live. So we live our little life; but Heaven is above us and all around and close to us; and Eternity is before us and behind us; and suns and stars are silent witnesses and watchers over us. We are enfolded by Infinity. Infinite Powers and Infinite spaces lie all around us. The dread arch of Mystery spreads over us, and no voice ever pierced it. Eternity is enthroned amid Heaven's myriad starry heights; and no utterance or word ever came from those far-off and silent spaces. Above, is that awful majesty; around us, everywhere, it stretches off into infinity; and beneath it is this little struggle of life, this poor day's conflict, this busy ant-hill of Time. But from that ant-hill, not only the talk of the streets, the sounds of music and revelling, the stir and tread of a multitude, the shout of joy and the shriek of agony go up into the silent and all-surrounding Infinitude; but also, amidst the stir and noise of visible life, from the inmost bosom of the visible man, there goes up an imploring call, a beseeching cry, an asking, unuttered, and unutterable, for revelation, wailingly and in almost speechless agony praying the dread arch of mystery to break, and the stars that roll above the waves of mortal trouble, to speak; the enthroned majesty of those awful heights to find a voice; the mysterious and reserved heavens to come near; and all to tell us what they alone know; to give us information of the loved and lost; to make known to us what we are, and whither we are going. Man is encompassed with a dome of incomprehensible wonders. In him and about him is that which should fill his life with majesty and sacredness. Something of sublimity and sanctity has thus flashed down from heaven into the heart of every one that lives. There is no being so base and abandoned but hath some traits of that sacredness left upon him; something, so much perhaps in discordance with his general repute, that he hides it from all around him; some sanctuary in his soul, where no one may enter; some sacred inclosure, where the memory of a child is, or the image of a venerated parent, or the remembrance of a pure love, or the echo of some word of kindness once spoken to him; an echo that will never die away. Life is no negative, or superficial or worldly existence. Our steps are evermore haunted with thoughts, far beyond their own range, which some have regarded as the reminiscences of a preexistent state. So it is with us all, in the beaten and worn track of this worldly pilgrimage. There is more here, than the world we live in. It is not all of life to live. An unseen and infinite presence is here; a sense of something greater than we possess; a seeking, through all the void wastes of life, for a good beyond it; a crying out of the heart for interpretation; a memory of the dead, touching continually some vibrating thread in this great tissue of mystery. We all not only have better intimations, but are capable of better thingsthan we know. The pressure of some great emergency would develop in us powers, beyond the worldly bias of our spirits; and Heaven so deals with us, from time to time, as to call forth those better things. There is hardly a family in the world go selfish, but that, if one in it were doomed to die - one, to be selected by the others, - it would be utterly impossible for its members, parents and children, to choose out that victim; but that each would say, "I will die; but I cannot choose." And in how many, if that dire extremity had come, would not one and another step forth, freed from the vile meshes of ordinary selfishness, and say, like the Roman father and son, "Let the blow fall on me!" There are greater and better things in us all, than the world takes account of, or than we take note of; if we would but find them out. And it is one part of our Masonic culture to find these traits of power and sublime devotion, to revive these faded impressions of generosity and self-sacrifice, the almost squandered bequests of God's love and kindness to our souls; and to induce us to yield ourselves to their guidance and control. Upon all conditions of men presses down one impartial law. To all situations, to all fortunes, high or low, the mind gives their character. They are, in effect, not what they are in themselves, but what they are to the feeling of their possessors. The King may be mean, degraded, miserable; the slave of ambition, fear, voluptuousness, and every low passion. The Peasant may be the real Monarch, the moral master of his fate, a free and lofty being, more than a Prince in happiness, more than a King in honor. Man is no bubble upon the sea of his fortunes, helpless and irresponsible upon the tide of events. Out of the same circumstances, different men bring totally different results. The same difficulty, distress, poverty, or misfortune, that breaks down one man, builds up another and makes him strong. It is the very attribute and glory of a man, that he can bend the circumstances of his condition to the intellectual and moral purposes of his nature, and it is the power and mastery of his will that chiefly distinguish him from the brute. The faculty of moral will, developed in the child, is a new element of his nature. It is a new power brought upon the scene, and a ruling power, delegated from Heaven. Never was a human being sunk so low that he had not, by God's gift, the power to rise, Because God commands him to rise, it is certain that he can rise.Every man has the power, and should use it, to make all situations, trials, and temptations instruments to promote his virtue and happiness; and is so far from being the creature of circumstances, that he creates and controls them, making them to be all that they are, of evil or of good, to him as a moral being. Life is what we make it, and the world is what we make it. The eyes of the cheerful and of the melancholy man are fixed upon the same creation; but very different are the aspects which it bears to them. To the one, it is all beauty and gladness; the waves of ocean roll in light, and the mountains are covered with day. Life, to him, flashes, rejoicing, upon every flower and every tree that trembles in the breeze. There is more to him, everywhere, than the eye sees; a presence of profound joy on hill and valley, and bright, dancing water. The other idly or mournfully gazes at the same scene, and everything wears a dull, dim, and sickly aspect. The murmuring of the brooks is a discord to him, the great roar of the sea has an angry and threatening emphasis, the solemn music of the pines sings the requiem of his departed happiness; the cheerful light shines garishly upon his eyes and offends him. The great train of the seasons passes before him like a funeral procession; and he sighs, and turns impatiently away. The eye makes that which it looks upon; the ear makes its own melodies and discords; the world without reflects the world within. Let the Mason never forget that life and the world are what we make them by our social character; by our adaptation, or want of adaptation to the social conditions, relationships, and pursuits of the world. To the selfish, the cold, and the insensible, to the haughty and presuming, to the proud, who demand more than they are likely to receive, to the jealous, ever afraid they shall not receive enough, to those who are unreasonably sensitive about the good or ill opinions of others, to all violators of the social laws, the rude, the violent, the dishonest, and the sensual, - to all these, the social condition, from its very nature, will present annoyances, disappointments, and pains, appropriate to their several characters. The benevolent affections will not revolve around selfishness; the cold-hearted must expect to meet coldness; the proud, haughtiness; the passionate, anger; and the violent, rudeness. Those who forget the rights of others, must not be surprised if their own are forgotten; and those who stoop to the lowest embraces of sense must not wonder, if others are not concerned to find their prostrate honor, and lift it up to the remembranceand respect of the world. To the gentle, many will be gentle; to the kind, many will be kind. A good man will find that there is goodness in the world; an honest man will find that there is honesty in the world; and a man of principle will find principle and integrity in the minds of others. There are no blessings which the mind may not convert into the bitterest of evils; and no trials which it may not transform into the noblest and divinest blessings. There are no temptations from which assailed virtue may not gain strength, instead of falling before them, vanquished and subdued. It is true that temptations have a great power, and virtue often falls; but the might of these temptations lies not in themselves, but in the feebleness of our own virtue, and the weakness of our own hearts. We rely too much on the strength of our ramparts and bastions, and allow the enemy to make his approaches, by trench and parallel, at his leisure. The offer of dishonest gain and guilty pleasure makes the honest man more honest, and the pure man more pure. They raise his virtue to the height of towering indignation. The fair occasion, the safe opportunity, the tempting chance become the defeat and disgrace of the tempter. The honest and upright man does not wait until temptation has made its approaches and mounted its batteries on the last parallel. But to the impure, the dishonest, the false-hearted, the corrupt, and the sensual, occasions come every day, and in every scene, and through every avenue of thought and imagination. He is prepared to capitulate before the first approach is commenced; and sends out the white flag when the enemy's advance comes in sight of his walls. He makes occasions; or, if opportunities come not, evil thoughts come, and he throws wide open the gates of his heart and welcomes those bad visitors, and entertains them with a lavish hospitality. The business of the world absorbs, corrupts, and degrades one mind, while in another it feeds and nurses the noblest independence, integrity, and generosity. Pleasure is a poison to some, and a healthful refreshment to others. To one, the world is a great harmony, like a noble strain of music with infinite modulations; to another, it is a huge factory, the clash and clang of whose machinery jars upon his ears and frets him to madness. Life is substantiallythe same thing to all who partake of its lot. Yet some rise to virtue and glory; while others, undergoing the same discipline, and enjoying the same privileges, sink to shame and perdition. Thorough, faithful, and honest endeavor to improve, is always successful, and the highest happiness. To sigh sentimentally over human misfortune, is fit only for the mind's childhood; and the mind's misery is chiefly its own fault; appointed, under the good Providence of God, as the punisher and corrector of its fault. In the long run, the mind will be happy, just in proportion to its fidelity and wisdom. When it is miserable, it has planted the thorns in its own path; it grasps them, and cries out in loud complaint;. and that complaint is but the louder confession that the thorns which grew there, it planted. A certain kind and degree of spirituality enter into the largest part of even the most ordinary life. You can carry on no business, without some faith in man. You cannot even dig in the ground, without a reliance on the unseen result. You cannot think or reason or even step, without confiding in the inward, spiritual principles of your nature. All the affections and bonds, and hopes and interests of life centre in the spiritual; and you know that if that central bond were broken, the world would rush to chaos. Believe that there is a God; that He is our father; that He has a paternal interest in our welfare and improvement; that He has given us powers, by means of which we may escape from sin and ruin; that He has destined us to a future life of endless progress toward perfection and a knowledge of Himself - believe this, as every Mason should, and you can live calmly, endure patiently, labor resolutely, deny yourselves cheerfully, hope steadfastly, and be conquerors in the great struggle of life. Take away any one of these principles, and what remains for us? Say that there is no God; or no way opened for hope and reformation and triumph, no heaven to come, no rest for the weary, no home in the bosom of God for the afflicted and disconsolate soul; or that God is but an ugly blind Chance that stabs in the dark; or a somewhat that is, when attempted to be defined, a nowhat, emotionless, passionless, the Supreme Apathy to which all things, good and evil, are alike indifferent; or a jealous God who revengefully visits the sins of the fathers on the children, and when the fathers have eatensour grapes, sets the children's teeth on edge; an arbitrary supreme Will, that has made it right to be virtuous, and wrong to lie and steal, because IT pleased to make it so rather than otherwise, retaining the power to reverse the law; or a fickle, vacillating, inconstant Deity, or a cruel, bloodthirsty, savage Hebrew or Puritanic one; and we are but the sport of chance and the victims of despair; hapless wanderers upon the face of a desolate, forsaken, or accursed and hated earth; surrounded by darkness, struggling with obstacles, toiling for barren results and empty purposes, distracted with doubts, and misled by false gleams of light; wanderers with no way, no prospect, no home; doomed and deserted mariners on a dark and stormy sea, without compass or course, to whom no stars appear; tossing helmless upon the weltering, angry waves, with no blessed haven in the distance whose guiding-star invites us to its welcome rest. The religious faith thus taught by Masonry is indispensable to the attainment of the great ends of life; and must therefore have been designed to be a part of it. We are made for this faith; and there must be something, somewhere, for us to believe in. We cannot grow healthfully, nor live happily, without it. It is therefore true. If we could cut off from any soul all the principles taught by Masonry, the faith in a God, in immortality, in virtue, in essential rectitude, that soul would sink into sin, misery, darkness, and ruin. If we could cut off all sense of these truths, the man would sink at once to the grade of the animal. No man can suffer and be patient, can struggle and conquer, can improve and be happy, otherwise than as the swine are, without conscience, without hope, without a reliance on a just, wise, and beneficent God. We must, of necessity, embrace the great truths taught by Masonry, and live by them, to live happily. "I put my trust in God," is the protest of Masonry against the belief in a cruel, angry, and revengeful God, to be feared and not reverenced by His creatures. Society, in its great relations, is as much the creation of Heaven as is the system of the Universe. If that bond of gravitation that holds all worlds and systems together, were suddenly severed, the universe would fly into wild and boundless chaos. And if we were to sever all the moral bonds that hold society together; if we could cut off from it every conviction of Truth and Integrity, of an authority above it, and of a conscience within it, it would immediately rush to disorder and frightful anarchy and ruin. The religion we teach is therefore as really a principle of things, and as certain and true, as gravitation. Faith in moral principles, in virtue, and in God, is as necessary for the guidance of a man, as instinct is for the guidance of an animal. And therefore this faith, as a principle of man's nature, has a mission as truly authentic in God's Providence, as the principle of instinct. The pleasures of the soul, too, must depend on certain principles. They must recognize a soul, its properties and responsibilities, a conscience, and the sense of an authority above us; and these are the principles of faith. No man can suffer and be patient, can struggle and conquer, can improve and be happy, without conscience, without hope, without a reliance on a just, wise, and beneficent God. We must of necessity embrace the great truths taught by Masonry, and live by them, to live happily. Everything in the universe has fixed and certain laws and principles for its action;- the star in its orbit, the animal in its activity, the physical man in his functions. And he has likewise fixed and certain laws and principles as a spiritual being. His soul does not die for want of aliment or guidance. For the rational soul there is ample provision. From the lofty pine, rocked in the darkening tempest, the cry of the young raven is heard; and it would be most strange if there were no answer for the cry and call of the soul, tortured by want and sorrow and agony. The total rejection of all moral and religious belief would strike out a principle from human nature, as essential to it as gravitation to the stars, instinct to animal life, the circulation of the blood to the human body. God has ordained that life shall be a social state. We are members of a civil community. The life of that community depends upon its moral condition. Public spirit, intelligence, uprightness, temperance, kindness, domestic purity, will make it a happy community, and give it prosperity and continuance. Wide-spread selfishness, dishonesty, intemperance, libertinism, corruption, and crime, will make it miserable, and bring about dissolution and speedy ruin. A whole people lives one life; one mighty heart heaves in its bosom; it is one great pulse of existence that throbs there. One stream of life flows there, with ten thousand intermingled branches and channels, through all the homes of human love. One sound as of many waters, a rapturous jubilee or a mournful sighing, comes up fromthe congregated dwellings of a whole nation. The Public is no vague abstraction; nor should that which is done against that Public, against public interest, law, or virtue, press but lightly on the conscience. It is but a vast expansion of individual life; an ocean of tears, an atmosphere of sighs, or a great whole of joy and gladness. It suffers with the suffering of millions; it rejoices with the joy of millions. What a vast crime does he commit, - private man or public man, agent or contractor, legislator or magistrate, secretary or president,-who dares, with indignity and wrong, to strike the bosom of the Public Welfare, to encourage venality and corruption, and shameful sale of the elective franchise, or of office; to sow dissension, and to weaken the bonds of amity that bind a Nation together! What a huge iniquity, he who, with vices like the daggers of a parricide, dares to pierce that mighty heart, in which the ocean of existence is flowing! What an unequalled interest lies in the virtue of every one whom we love! In his virtue, nowhere but in his virtue, is garnered up the incomparable treasure. What care we for brother or friend, compared with what we care for his honor, his fidelity, his reputation, his kindness? How venerable is the rectitude of a parent! How sacred his reputation! No blight that can fall upon a child, is like a parent's dishonor. Heathen or Christian, every parent would have his child do well; and pours out upon him all the fullness of parental love, in the one desire that he may do well; that he may be worthy of his cares, and his freely bestowed pains; that he may walk in the way of honor and happiness. In that way he cannot walk one step without virtue. Such is life, in its relationships. A thousand ties embrace it, like the fine nerves of a delicate organization; like the strings of an instrument capable of sweet melodies, but easily put out of tune or broken, by rudeness, anger, and selfish indulgence. If life could, by any process, be made insensible to pain and pleasure; if the human heart were hard as adamant, then avarice, ambition, and sensuality might channel out their paths in it, and make it their beaten way; and none would wonder or protest. If we could be patient under the load of a mere worldly life; if we could bear that burden as the beasts bear it; then, like beasts, we might bend all our thoughts to the earth; and no call from the great Heavens above us would startle us from our plodding and earthly course. But we art not insensible brutes, who can refuse the call of reason and conscience. The soul is capable of remorse. When the great dispensations of life press down upon us, we weep, and suffer and sorrow. And sorrow and agony desire other companionships than worldliness and irreligion. We are not willing to bear those burdens of the heart, fear, anxiety, disappointment, and trouble, without any object or use. We are not willing to suffer, to be sick and afflicted, to have our days and months lost to comfort and joy, and overshadowed with calamity and grief, without advantage or compensation; to barter away the dearest treasures, the very sufferings, of the heart; to sell the life-blood from failing frame and fading cheek, our tears of bitterness and groans of anguish, for nothing. Human nature, frail, feeling, sensitive, and sorrowing, cannot bear to suffer for nought. Everywhere, human life is a great and solemn dispensation. Man, suffering, enjoying, loving, hating, hoping, and fearing, chained to the earth and yet exploring the far recesses of the universe, has the power to commune with God and His angels. Around this great action of existence the curtains of Time are drawn; but there are openings through them which give us glimpses of eternity. God looks down upon this scene of human probation. The wise and the good in all ages have interposed for it with their teachings and their blood. Everything that exists around us, every movement in nature every counsel of Providence, every interposition of God, centres upon one point - the fidelity of man. And even if the ghosts of the departed and remembered could come at midnight through the barred doors of our dwellings, and the shrouded dead should glide through the aisles of our churches and sit in our Masonic Temples, their teachings would be no more eloquent and impressive than the Great realities of life; than those memories of misspent years, those ghosts of departed opportunities, that, pointing to our conscience and eternity cry continually in our ears, "Work while the day lasts! for the night of death cometh, in which no man can work.” There are no tokens of public mourning for the calamity of the soul. Men weep when the body dies; and when it is borne to its last rest, they follow it with sad and mournful procession. Butfor the dying soul there is no open lamentation; for the lost soul there are no obsequies. And yet the mind and soul of man have a value which nothing else has. They are worth a care which nothing else is worth; and to the single, solitary individual, they ought to possess an interest which nothing else possesses. The stored treasures of the heart, the unfathomable mines that are in the soul to be wrought, the broad and boundless realms of Thought, the freighted argosy of man's hopes and best affections, are brighter than gold and dearer than treasure. And yet the mind is in reality little known or considered. It is all which man permanently is, his inward being, his divine energy, his immortal thought, his boundless capacity, his infinite aspiration; and nevertheless, few value it for what it is worth. Few see a brother-mind in others, through the rags with which poverty has clothed it, beneath the crushing burdens of life, amidst the close pressure of worldly troubles, wants and sorrows. Few acknowledge and cheer it in that humble blot, and feel that the nobility of earth, and the commencing glory of Heaven are there. Men do not feel the worth of their own souls. They are proud of their mental powers; but the intrinsic, inner, infinite worth of their own minds they do not perceive. The poor man, admitted to a palace, feels, lofty and immortal being as he is, like a mere ordinary thing amid the splendors that surround him. He sees the carriage of wealth roll by him, and forgets the intrinsic and eternal dignity of his own mind in a poor and degrading envy, and feels as an humbler creature, because others are above him, not in mind, but in mensuration. Men respect themselves, according as they are more wealthy, higher in rank or office, loftier in the world's opinion, able to command more votes, more the favorites of the people or of Power. The difference among men is not so much in their nature and intrinsic power, as in the faculty of communication. Some have the capacity of uttering and embodying in words their thoughts. All men, more or less, feel those thoughts. The glory of genius and the rapture of virtue, when rightly revealed, are diffused and shared among unnumbered minds. When eloquence and poetry speak; when those glorious arts, statuary, painting, and music, take audible or visible shape; when patriotism, charity, and virtuespeak with a thrilling potency, the hearts of thousands glow with a kindred joy and ecstasy. If it were not so, there would be no eloquence; for eloquence is that to which other hearts respond; it is the faculty and power of making other hearts respond. No one is so low or degraded, as not sometimes to be touched with the beauty of goodness. No heart is made of materials so common, or even base, as not sometimes to respond, through every chord of it, to the call of honor, patriotism, generosity, and virtue. The poor African Slave will die for the master. or mistress, or in defence of the children, whom he loves. The poor, lost, scorned, abandoned, outcast woman will, without expectation of reward nurse those who are dying on every hand, utter strangers to her, with a contagious and horrid pestilence. The pickpocket will scale burning walls to rescue child or woman, unknown to him, from the ravenous flames. Most glorious is this capacity! A power to commune with God and His Angels; a reflection of the Uncreated Light; a mirror that can collect and concentrate upon itself all the moral splendors of the Universe. It is the soul alone that gives any value to the things of this world. and it is only by raising the soul to its just elevation above all other things, that we can look rightly upon the purposes of this earth. No sceptre nor throne, nor structure of ages, nor broad empire, can compare with the wonders and grandeurs of a single thought. That alone, of all things that have been made, comprehends the Maker of all. That alone is the key which unlocks all the treasures of the Universe; the power that reigns over Space, Time, and Eternity. That, under God, is the Sovereign Dispenser to man of all the blessings and glories that lie within the compass of possession, or the range of possibility. Virtue, Heaven, and Immortality exist not, nor ever will exist for us except as they exist and will exist, in the perception, feeling, and thought of the glorious mind. My Brother, in the hope that you have listened to and understood the Instruction and Lecture of this Degree, and that you feel the dignity of your own nature and the vast capacities of your own soul for good or evil, I proceed briefly to communicate to you the remaining instruction of this Degree. The Hebrew word, in the old Hebrew and Samaritan character, suspended in the East, over the five columns, is ADONAÏ, one of the names of God, usually translated Lord; and which theHebrews, in reading, always substitute for the True Name, which is for them ineffable. The five columns, in the five different orders of architecture, are emblematical to us of the five principal divisions of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite: 1. - The Tuscan, of the three blue Degrees, or the primitive Masonry. 2. - The Doric, of the ineffable Degrees, from the, fourth to the fourteenth, inclusive. 3. - The Ionic, of the fifteenth and sixteenth, or second temple Degrees. 4. - The Corinthian, of the seventeenth and eighteenth Degrees, or those of the new law. 5. - The Composite, of the philosophical and chivalric Degrees intermingled, from the nineteenth to the thirty-second, inclusive. The North Star, always fixed and immutable for us, represents the point in the centre of the circle, or the Deity in the centre of the Universe. It is the especial symbol of duty and of faith. To it, and the seven that continually revolve around it, mystical meanings are attached, which you will learn hereafter, if you should be permitted to advance, when you are made acquainted with the philosophical doctrines of the Hebrews. The Morning Star, rising in the East, Jupiter, called by the Hebrews Tsadõc or Tsydyk, Just, is an emblem to us of the ever approaching dawn of perfection and Masonic light. The three great lights of the Lodge are symbols to us of the Power, Wisdom, and Beneficence of the Deity. They are also symbols of the first three Sephiroth, or Emanations of the Deity, according to the Kabalah, Kether, the omnipotent divine will; Chochmah, the divine intellectual power to generate thought, and Binah, the divine intellectual capacity to produce it - the two latter, usually translated Wisdom and Understanding, being the active and the passive, the positive and the negative, which we do not yet endeavor to explain to you. They are the columns Jachin and Boaz, that stand at the entrance to the Masonic Temple. In another aspect of this Degree, the Chief of the Architects [ , Rab Banaim,] symbolizes the constitutional executive head and chief of a free government; and the Degree teaches us that no free government can long endure, when the people ceaseto select for their magistrates the best and the wisest of their statesmen; when, passing these by, they permit factions or sordid interests to select for them the small, the low, the ignoble, and the obscure, and into such hands commit the country's destinies. There is, after all, a "divine right" to govern; and it is vested in the ablest, wisest, best, of every nation. "Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding: I am power: by me kings do reign, and princes decree justice; by me princes rule, and nobles, even all the magistrates of the earth." For the present, my Brother, let this suffice. We welcome you among us, to this peaceful retreat of virtue, to a participation in our privileges, to a share in our joys and our sorrows. XIII. ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. WHETHER the legend and history of this Degree are historically true, or but an allegory, containing in itself a deeper truth and a profounder meaning, we shall not now debate. If it be but a legendary myth, you must find out for yourself what it means. It is certain that the word which the Hebrews are not now permitted to pronounce was in common use by Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Laban, Rebecca, and even among tribes foreign to the Hebrews, before the time of Moses; and that it recurs a hundred times in the lyrical effusions of David and other Hebrew poets. We know that for many centuries the Hebrews have been forbidden to pronounce the Sacred Name; that wherever it occurs, they have for ages read the word Adonaï instead; and that under it, when the masoretic points, which represent the vowels, came to be used, they placed those which belonged to the latter word. The possession of the true pronunciation was deemed to confer on him who had it extraordinary and supernatural powers; and the Word itself, worn upon the person, was regarded as an amulet, a protection against personal danger, sickness, and evil spirits. We know that all this was a vain superstition, natural to a rude people, necessarily disappearing as the intellect of man became enlightened; and wholly unworthy of a Mason. It is noticeable that this notion of the sanctity of the Divine Name or Creative Word was common to all the ancient nations. The Sacred Word HOM was supposed by the ancient Persians (who were among the earliest emigrants from Northern India) tobe pregnant with a mysterious power; and they taught that by its utterance the world was created. In India it was forbidden to pronounce the word AUM or OM, the Sacred Name of the One Deity, manifested as Brahma, Vishna, and Seeva. These superstitious notions in regard to the efficacy of the Word, and the prohibition against pronouncing it, could, being errors, have formed no part of the pure primitive religion, or of the esoteric doctrine taught by Moses, and the full knowledge of which was confined to the Initiates; unless the whole was but an ingenious invention for the concealment of some other Name or truth, the interpretation and meaning whereof was made known only to the select few. If so, the common notions in regard to the Word grew up in the minds of the people, like other errors and fables among all the ancient nations, out of original truths and symbols and allegories misunderstood. So it has always been that allegories, intended as vehicles of truth, to be understood by the sages, have become or bred errors, by being literally accepted. It is true, that before the masoretic points were invented (which was after the beginning of the Christian era), the pronunciation of a word in the Hebrew language could not be known from the characters in which it was written. It was, therefore, possible for that of the name of the Deity to have been forgotten and lost. It is certain that its true pronunciation is not that represented by the word Jehovah; and therefore that that is not the true name of Deity, nor the Ineffable Word. The ancient symbols and allegories always had more than one interpretation. They always had a double meaning, and sometimes more than two, one serving as the envelope of the other. Thus the pronunciation of the word was a symbol; and that pronunciation and the word itself were lost, when the knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God faded out of the minds of the Jewish people. That is one interpretation - true, but not the inner and profoundest one. Men were figuratively said to forget the name of God, when they lost that knowledge, and worshipped the heathen deities, and burned incense to them on the high places, and passed their children through the fire to Moloch. Thus the attempts of the ancient Israelites and of the Initiates to ascertain the True Name of the Deity, and its pronunciation, and the loss of the True Word, are an allegory, in which arerepresented the general ignorance of the true nature and attributes of God, the proneness of the people of Judah and Israel to worship other deities, and the low and erroneous and dishonoring notions of the Grand Architect of the Universe, which all shared except a few favored persons; for even Solomon built altars and sacrificed to Astarat, the goddess of the Tsidumm, and Malcüm, the Aamünite god, and built high places for Kamüs, the Moabite deity, and Malec the god of the Beni-Aamün. The true nature of God was unknown to them, like His name; and they worshipped the calves of Jeroboam, as in the desert they did that made for them by Aarün. The mass of the Hebrews did not believe in the existence of one only God until a late period in their history. Their. early and popular ideas of the Deity were singularly low and unworthy. Even while Moses was receiving the law upon Mount Sinai, they forced Aarün to make them an image of the Egyptian god Apis, and fell down and adored it. They were ever ready to return to the worship of the gods of the Mitzraim; and soon after the death of Joshua they became devout worshippers of the false gods of all the surrounding nations. "Ye have borne," Amos, the prophet, said to them, speaking of their forty years' journeying in the desert, under Moses, "the tabernacle of your Malec and Kaiün your idols, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves." Among them, as among other nations, the conceptions of God formed by individuals varied according to their intellectual and spiritual capacities; poor and imperfect, and investing God with the commonest and coarest attributes of humanity, among the ignorant and coarse; pure and lofty among the virtuous and richly gifted. These conceptions gradually improved and became purified and ennobled, as the nation advanced in civilization - being lowest in the historical books, amended in the prophetic writings, and reaching their highest elevation among the poets. Among all the ancient nations there was one faith and one idea of Deity for the enlightened, intelligent, and educated, and another for the common people. To this rule the Hebrews were no exception. Yehovah, to the mass of the people, was like the gods of the nations around them, except that he was the peculiar God, first of the family of Abraham, of that of Isaac, and of that of Jacob, and afterward the National God; and, as they believed, more powerful than the other gods of the same nature worshippedby their neighbors - "Who among the Baalim is like unto thee, O Yehovah?" - expressed their whole creed. The Deity of the early Hebrews talked to Adam and Eve in the garden of delight, as he walked in it in the cool of the day; he conversed with Kayin; he sat and ate with Abraham in his tent; that patriarch required a visible token, before he would believe in his positive promise; he permitted Abraham to expostulate with him, and to induce him to change his first determination in regard to Sodom; he wrestled with Jacob; he showed Moses his person, though not his face; he dictated the minutest police regulations and the dimensions of the tabernacle and its furniture, to the Israelites; he insisted on and delighted in sacrifices and burnt-offerings; he was angry, jealous, and revengeful, as well as wavering and irresolute; he allowed Moses to reason him out of his fixed resolution utterly to destroy his people; he commanded the performance of the most shocking and hideous acts of cruelty and barbarity. He hardened the heart of Pharaoh; he repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto the people of Nineveh; and he did it not, to the disgust and anger of Jonah. Such were the popular notions of the Deity; and either the priests had none better, or took little trouble to correct these notions; or the popular intellect was not enough enlarged to enable them to entertain any higher conceptions of the Almighty. But such were not the ideas of the intellectual and enlightened few among the Hebrews. It is certain that they possessed a knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God; as the same class of men did among the other nations - Zoroaster, Menu, Confucius, Socrates, and Plato. But their doctrines on this subject were esoteric; they did not communicate them to the people at large, but only to a favored few; and as they were communicated in Egypt and India, in Persia and Phoenicia, in Greece and Samothrace, in the greater mysteries, to the Initiates. The communication of this knowledge and other secrets, some of which are perhaps lost, constituted, under other names, what we now call Masonry, or Free or Frank-Masonry. That knowledge was, in one sense, the Lost Word, which was made known to the Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Masons. It would be folly to pretend that the forms of Masonry were the same in those ages as they are now. The present name of the Order, and its titles, and the names of the Degrees now in use, were not then known.Even Blue Masonry cannot trace back its authentic history, with its present Degrees, further than the year 1700, if so far. But, by whatever name it was known in this or the other country, Masonry existed as it now exists, the same in spirit and at heart, not only when Solomon builded the temple, but centuries before - before even the first colonies emigrated into Southern India, Persia, and Egypt, from the cradle of the human race. The Supreme, Self-existent, Eternal, All-wise, All-powerful, Infinitely Good, Pitying, Beneficent, and Merciful Creator and Preserver of the Universe was the same, by whatever name he was called, to the intellectual and enlightened men of all nations. The name was nothing, if not a symbol and representative hieroglyph of his nature and attributes. The name AL represented his remoteness above men, his inaccessibility; BAL and BALA, his might; ALOHIM, his various potencies; IHUH, existence and the generation of things. None of his names, among the Orientals, were the symbols of a divinely infinite love and tenderness, and all-embracing mercy. As MOLOCH or MALEK he was but an omnipotent monarch, a tremendous and irresponsible Will; as ADONAÏ, only an arbitrary LORD and Master; as AL Shadaï, potent and a DESTROYER. To communicate true and correct ideas in respect of the Deity was one chief object of the mysteries. In them, Khürüm the King, and Khürüm the Master, obtained their knowledge of him and his attributes; and in them that knowledge was taught to Moses and Pythagoras. Wherefore nothing forbids you to consider the whole legend of this Degree, like that of the Master's, an allegory, representing the perpetuation of the knowledge of the True God in the sanctuaries of initiation. By the subterranean vaults you may understand the places of initiation, which in the ancient ceremonies were generally under ground. The Temple of Solomon presented a symbolic image of the Universe; and resembled, in its arrangements and furniture, all the temples of the ancient nations that practised the mysteries. The system of numbers was intimately connected with their religions and worship, and has come down to us in Masonry; though the esoteric meaning with which the numbers used by us are pregnant is unknown to the vast majority of those who use them. Those numbers were especially employed that had a reference to the Deity, represented his attributes, or figured in theframe-work of the world, in time and space, and formed more or less the bases of that frame-work. These were universally regarded as sacred, being the expression of order and intelligence, the utterances of Divinity Himself. The Holy of Holies of the Temple formed a cube; in which, drawn on a plane surface, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 lines visible, and three sides or faces. It corresponded with the number four, by which the ancients presented Nature, it being the number of substances or corporeal forms, and of the elements, the cardinal points and seasons, and the secondary colors. The number three everywhere represented the Supreme Being. Hence the name of the Deity, engraven upon the triangular plate, and that sunken into the cube of agate, taught the ancient Mason, and teaches us, that the true knowledge of God, of His nature and His attributes is written by Him upon the leaves of the great Book of Universal Nature, and may be read there by all who are endowed with the requisite amount of intellect and intelligence. This knowledge of God, so written there, and of which Masonry has in all ages been the interpreter, is the Master Mason's Word. Within the Temple, all the arrangements were mystically and symbolically connected with the same system. The vault or ceiling, starred like the firmament, was supported by twelve columns, representing the twelve months of the year. The border that ran around the columns represented the zodiac, and one of the twelve celestial signs was appropriated to each column. The brazen sea was supported by twelve oxen, three looking to each cardinal point of the compass. And so in our day every Masonic Lodge represents the Universe. Each extends, we are told, from the rising to the setting sun, from the South to the North, from the surface of the Earth to the Heavens, and from the same to the centre of the globe. In it are represented the sun, moon, and stars; three great torches in the East, West, and South, forming a triangle, give it light: and, like the Delta or Triangle suspended in the East, and inclosing the Ineffable Name, indicate, by the mathematical equality of the angles and sides, the beautiful and harmonious proportions which govern in the aggregate and details of the Universe; while those sides and angles represent, by their number, three, the Trinity of Power, Wisdom, and Harmony, which presided at the building of this marvellous work These three great lights also represent thegreat mystery of the three principles, of creation, dissolution or destruction, and reproduction or regeneration, consecrated by all creeds in their numerous Trinities. The luminous pedestal, lighted by the perpetual flame within, is a symbol of that light of Reason, given by God to man, by which he is enabled to read in the Book of Nature the record of the thought, the revelation of the attributes of the Deity. The three Masters, Adoniram, Joabert, and Stolkin, are types of the True Mason, who seeks for knowledge from pure motives, and that he may be the better enabled to serve and benefit his fellow-men; while the discontented and presumptuous Masters who were buried in the ruins of the arches represent those who strive to acquire it for unholy purposes, to gain power over their fellows, to gratify their pride, their vanity, or their ambition. The Lion that guarded the Ark and held in his mouth the key wherewith to open it, figuratively represents Solomon, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who preserved and communicated the key to the true knowledge of God, of His laws, and of the profound mysteries of the moral and physical Universe. ENOCH [ Khanõc], we are told, walked with God three hundred years, after reaching the age of sixty-five - "walked with God, and he was no more, for God had taken him." His name signified in the Hebrew, INITIATE or INITIATOR. The legend of the columns, of granite and brass or bronze, erected by him, is probably symbolical. That of bronze, which survived the flood, is supposed to symbolize the mysteries, of which Masonry is the legitimate successor - from the earliest times the custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths, unknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems, and allegories. The legend of this Degree is thus, partially, interpreted. It is of little importance whether it is in anywise historical. For its value consists in the lessons which it inculcates, and the duties which it prescribes to those who receive it. The parables and allegories of the Scriptures are not less valuable than history. Nay, they are more so, because ancient history is little instructive, and truths are concealed in and symbolized by the legend and the myth. There are profounder meanings concealed in the symbols of this Degree, connected with the philosophical system of the HebrewKabalists, which you will learn hereafter, if you should be so fortunate as to advance. They are unfolded in the higher Degrees. The lion [ Arai, Araiah, which also means the altar] still holds in his mouth the key of the enigma of the sphynx. But there is one application of this Degree, that you are now entitled to know; and which, remembering that Khürüm, the Master, is the symbol of human freedom, you would probably discover for yourself. It is not enough for a people to gain its liberty. It must secure it. It must not intrust it to the keeping, or hold it at the pleasure, of any one man. The keystone of the Royal Arch of the great Temple of Liberty is a fundamental law, charter, or constitution; the expression of the fixed habits of thought of the people, embodied in a written instrument, or the result of the slow accretions and the consolidation of centuries; the same in war as in peace; that cannot be hastily changed, nor be violated with impunity, but is sacred, like the Ark of the Covenant of God, which none could touch and live. A permanent constitution, rooted in the affections, expressing the will and judgment, and built upon the instincts and settled habits of thought of the people, with an independent judiciary, an elective legislature of two branches, an executive responsible to the people, and the right of trial by jury, will guarantee the liberties of a people, if it be virtuous and temperate, without luxury, and without the lust of conquest and dominion, and the follies of visionary theories of impossible perfection. Masonry teaches its Initiates that the pursuits and occupations of this life, its activity, care, and ingenuity, the predestined developments of the nature given us by God, tend to promote His great design, in making the world; and are not at war with the great purpose of life. It teaches that everything is beautiful in its time, in its place, in its appointed office; that everything which man is put to do, if rightly and faithfully done, naturally helps to work out his salvation; that if he obeys the genuine principles of his calling, he will be a good man: and that it is only by neglect and nonperformance of the task set for him by Heaven, by wandering into idle dissipation, or by violating their beneficent and lofty spirit, that he becomes a bad man. The appointed action of life is the great training of Providence; and if man yields himselfto it, he will need neither churches nor ordinances, except for the expression of his religious homage and gratitude. For there is a religion of toil. It is not all drudgery, a mere stretching of the limbs and straining of the sinews to tasks. It has a meaning and an intent. A living heart pours life-blood into the toiling arm; and warm affections inspire and mingle with man's labors. They are the home affections. Labor toils a-field, or plies its task in cities, or urges the keels of commerce over wide oceans; but home is its centre; and thither it ever goes with its earnings, with the means of support and comfort for others; offerings sacred to the thought of every true man, as a sacrifice at a golden shrine. Many faults there are amidst the toils of life; many harsh and hasty words are uttered; but still the toils go on, weary and hard and exasperating as they often are. For in that home is age or sickness, or helpless infancy, or gentle childhood, or feeble woman, that must not want. If man had no other than mere selfish impulses, the scene of labor which we behold around us would not exist. The advocate who fairly and honestly presents his case, with feeling of true self-respect, honor, and conscience, to help the tribunal on towards the right conclusion, with a conviction that God's justice reigns there, is acting a religious part, leading that day religious life; or else right and justice are no part of religion Whether, during all that day, he has once appealed, in form or in terms, to his conscience, or not; whether he has once spoken of religion and God, or not; if there has been the inward purpose, the conscious intent and desire, that sacred justice should triumph, he has that day led a good and religious life, and made most a essential contribution to that religion of life and of society, the cause of equity between man and man, and of truth and right action in the world. Books, to be of religious tendency in the Masonic sense, need not be books of sermons, of pious exercises, or of prayers. Whatever inculcates pure, noble, and patriotic sentiments, or touches the heart with the beauty of virtue, and the excellence of an upright life, accords with the religion of Masonry, and is the Gospel of literature and art. That Gospel is preached from many a book and painting, from many a poem and fiction, and review and newspaper; and it is a painful error and miserable narrowness, not to recognize these wide-spread agencies of Heaven's providing; notto see and welcome these many-handed coadjutors, to the great and good cause. The oracles of God do not speak from the pulpit alone. There is also a religion of society. In business, there is much more than sale, exchange, price, payment; for there is the sacred faith of man in man. When we repose perfect confidence in the integrity of another; when we feel that he will not swerve from the right, frank, straightforward, conscientious course, for any temptation; his integrity and conscientiousness are the image of God to us; and when we believe in it, it is as great and generous an act, as when we believe in the rectitude of the Deity. In gay assemblies for amusement, the good affections of life gush and mingle. If they did not, these gathering-places would be as dreary and repulsive as the caves and dens of outlaws and robbers. When friends meet, and hands are warmly pressed, and the eye kindles and the countenance is suffused with gladness, there is a religion between their hearts; and each loves and worships the True and Good that is in the other. It is not policy, or self-interest, or selfishness that spreads such a charm around that meeting, but the halo of bright and beautiful affection. The same splendor of kindly liking, and affectionate regard, shines like the soft overarching sky, over all the world; over all places where men meet, and walk or toil together; not over lovers' bowers and marriage-altars alone, not over the homes of purity and tenderness alone; but over all tilled fields, and busy workshops, and dusty highways, and paved streets. There is not a worn stone upon the sidewalks, but has been the altar of such offerings of mutual kindness; nor a wooden pillar or iron railing against which hearts beating with affection have not leaned. How many soever other elements there are in the stream of life flowing through these channels, that is surely here and everywhere; honest, heartfelt, disinterested, inexpressible affection. Every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion; and its teachings are instruction in religion. For here are inculcated disinterestedness, affection, toleration, devotedness, patriotism, truth, a generous sympathy with those who suffer and mourn, pity for the fallen, mercy for the erring, relief for those in want, Faith, Hope, and Charity. Here we meet as brethren, to learn to know and love each other. Here we greet each other gladly, are lenient to each other's faults, regardful of each other's feelings, ready to relieveeach other's wants. This is the true religion revealed to the ancient patriarchs; which Masonry has taught for many centuries, and which it will continue to teach as long as time endures. If unworthy passions, or selfish, bitter, or revengeful feelings, contempt, dislike, hatred, enter here, they are intruders and n t welcome, strangers uninvited, and not guests. Certainly there are many evils and bad passions, and much hate and contempt and unkindness everywhere in the world. We cannot refuse to see the evil -that is in life. But all is not evil. We still see God in the world. There is good amidst the evil. The hand of mercy leads wealth to the hovels of poverty and sorrow. Truth and simplicity live amid many wiles and sophistries. There are good hearts underneath gay robes, and under tattered garments also. Love clasps the hand of love, amid all the envyings and distractions of showy competition; fidelity, pity, and sympathy hold the long night-watch by the bedside of the suffering neighbor, amidst the surrounding poverty and squalid misery. Devoted men go from city to city to nurse those smitten down by the terrible pestilence that renews at intervals its mysterious marches. Women well-born and delicately nurtured nursed the wounded soldiers in hospitals, before it became fashionable to do so; and even poor lost women, whom God alone loves and pities, tend the plaguestricken with a patient and generous heroism. Masonry and its kindred Orders teach men to love each other, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the sick, and bury the friendless dead. Everywhere God finds and blesses the kindly office, the pitying thought, and the loving heart. There is an element of good in all men's lawful pursuits and a divine spirit breathing in all their lawful affections. The ground on which they tread is holy ground. There is a natural religion of life, answering, with however many a broken tone, to the religion of nature. There is a beauty and glory in Humanity., in man, answering, with however many a mingling shade, to the loveliness of soft landscapes and swelling hills, and the wondrous Men may be virtuous, self-improving, and religious in their employments. Precisely for that, those employments were made. All their social relations, friendship, love , the ties of family, were made to be holy. They may be religious, not by a kind of protestand resistance against their several vocations; but by conformity to their true spirit. Those vocations do not exclude religion; but demand it, for their own perfection. They may be religious laborers, whether in field or factory; religious physicians, lawyers, sculptors, poets, painters, and musicians. They may be religious in all the toils and in all the amusements of life. Their life may be a religion; the broad earth its altar; its incense the very breath of life; its fires ever kindled by the brightness of Heaven. Bound up with our poor, frail life, is the mighty thought that spurns the narrow span of all visible existence. Ever the soul reaches outward, and asks for freedom. It looks forth from the narrow and grated windows of sense, upon the wide immeasurable creation; it knows that around it and beyond it lie outstretched the infinite and everlasting paths. Everything within us and without us ought to stir our minds to admiration and wonder. We are a mystery encompassed with mysteries. The connection of mind with matter is a mystery; the wonderful telegraphic communication between the brain and every part of the body, the power and action of the will. Every familiar step is more than a story in a land of enchantment. The power of movement is as mysterious as the power of thought. Memory, and dreams that are the indistinct echoes of dead memories are alike inexplicable. Universal harmony springs from infinite complication. The momentum of every step we take in our dwelling contributes in part to the order of the Universe. We are connected by ties of thought, and even of matter and its forces, with the whole boundless Universe and all the past and coming generations of men. The humblest object beneath our eye as completely defies our scrutiny as the economy of the most distant star. Every leaf and every blade of grass holds within itself secrets which no human penetration will ever fathom. No man can tell what is its principle of life. No man can know what his power of secretion is. Both are inscrutable mysteries. Wherever we place our hand we lay it upon the locked bosom of mystery. Step where we will, we tread upon wonders. The sea-sands, the clods of the field, the water-worn pebbles on the hills, the rude masses of rock, are traced over and over, in every direction, with a handwriting older and more significant and sublime than all the ancient ruins, and all the overthrown and buried cities that past generationshave left upon the earth; for it is the handwriting of the Almighty. A Mason's great business with life is to read the book of its teaching; to find that life is not the doing of drudgeries, but the hearing of oracles. The old mythology is but a leaf in that book; for it peopled the world with spiritual natures; and science, many-leaved, still spreads before us the same tale of wonder. We shall be just as happy hereafter, as we are pure and upright, and no more, just as happy as our character prepares us to be, and no more. Our moral, like our mental character, is nut formed in a moment; it is the habit of our minds; the result of many thoughts and feelings and efforts, bound together by many natural and strong ties. The great law of Retribution is, that all coming experience is to be affected by every present feeling; every future moment of being must answer for every present moment; one moment, sacrificed to vice, or lost to improvement, is forever sacrificed and lost; an hour's delay to enter the right path, is to put us back so far, in the everlasting pursuit of happiness; and every sin, even of the best men, is to be thus answered for, if not according to the full measure of its illdesert, yet according to a rule of unbending rectitude and impartiality. The law of retribution presses upon every m an, whether he thinks of it or not. It pursues him through all the courses of life, with a step that never falters nor tires, and with an eye that never sleeps. If it were not so, God's government would not be impartial; 'there would be no discrimination; no moral dominion; no light shed upon the mysteries of Providence. Whatsoever a man soweth, that, and not something else, shall he reap. That which we are doing, good or evil, grave or gay, that which we do today and shall do to-morrow; each thought, each feeling, each action, each event; every passing hour, every breathing moment; all are contributing to form the character according to which we are to be judged. Every particle of influence that goes to form that aggregate, - our character, - will, in that future scrutiny, be sifted out from the mass; and, particle by particle, with ages perhaps intervening, fall a distinct contribution to the sum of our joys or woes. Thus every idle word and idle hour will give answer in the judgment. Let us take care, therefore, what we sow. An evil temptation comes upon us; the opportunity of unrighteous gain, or of unhallowedindulgence, either in the sphere of business or pleasure, of society or solitude. We yield; and plant a seed of bitterness and sorrow. To-morrow it will threaten discovery. Agitated and alarmed, we cover the sin, and bury it deep in falsehood and hypocrisy. In the bosom where it lies concealed, in the fertile soil of kindred vices, that sin dies not, but thrives and grows; and other and still other germs of evil gather around the accursed root; until, from that single seed of corruption, there springs up in the soul all that is horrible in habitual lying, knavery, or vice. Loathingly, often, we take each downward step; but a frightful power urges us onward; and the hell of debt, disease, ignominy, or remorse gathers its shadows around Our steps even on earth; and are yet but the beginnings of sorrows. The evil deed may be done in a single moment; but conscience never dies, memory never sleeps; guilt never can become innocence; and remorse can never whisper peace. Beware, thou who art tempted to evil! Beware what thou layest up for the future! Beware what thou layest up in the archives of eternity! Wrong not thy neighbor! lest the thought of him thou injurest, and who suffers by thy act, be to thee a pang which years will not deprive of its bitterness! Break not into the house of innocence, to rifle it of its treasure; lest when many years have passed over thee, the moan of its distress may not have died away from thine ear! Build not the desolate throne of ambition in thy heart; nor be busy with devices, and circumventings, and selfish schemings; lest desolation and loneliness be on thy path, as it stretches into the long futurity! Live not a useless, an impious, or an injurious life! for bound up with that life is the immutable principle of an endless retribution, and elements of God's creating, which will never spend their force, but continue ever to unfold with the ages of eternity. Be not deceived! God has formed thy nature, thus to answer to the future. His law can never be abrogated, nor His justice eluded; and forever and ever it will be true, that "Whatsoever a man soweth, that also he shall reap.” XIV. GRAND ELECT, PERFECT, AND SUBLIMEMASON.[Perfect Elu.] It is for each individual Mason to discover the secret of Ma-sonry, by reflection upon its symbols and a wise consideration andanalysis of what is said and done in the work. Masonry does notinculcate her truths. She states them, once and briefly; or hintsthem, perhaps, darkly; or interposes a cloud between them andeyes that would be dazzled by them. "Seek, and ye shall find,"knowledge and the truth.The practical object of Masonry is the physical and moralamelioration and the intellectual and spiritual improvement ofindividuals and society. Neither can be effected, except by thedissemination of truth. It is falsehood in doctrines and fallacyin principles, to which most of the miseries of men and the mis-fortunes of nations are owing. Public opinion is rarely right onany point; and there are and always will be important truths tobe substituted in that opinion in the place of many errors andabsurd and injurious prejudices. There are few truths that publicopinion has not at some time hated and persecuted as heresies;and few errors that have not at some time seemed to it truths radi-ant from the immediate presence of God. There are moral mala-dies, also, of man and society, the treatment of which requires notonly boldness, but also, and more, prudence and discretion; sincethey are more the fruit of false and pernicious doctrines, moral,political, and religious, than of vicious inclinations.Much of the Masonic secret manifests itself, without speechrevealing it to him who even partially comprehends all the De-grees in proportion as he receives them; and particularly to thosewho advance to the highest Degrees of the Ancient and AcceptedScottish Rite. That Rite raises a corner of the veil, even in theDegree of Apprentice; for it there declares that Masonry is aworship.Masonry labors to improve the social order by enlighteningmen's minds, warming their hearts with the love of the good, in-spiring them with the great principle of human fraternity, andrequiring of its disciples that their language and actions shall con-form to that principle, that they shall enlighten each other, con-trol their passions, abhor vice, and pity the vicious man as oneafflicted with a deplorable malady.It is the universal, eternal, immutable religion, such as Godplanted it in the heart of universal humanity. No creed has everbeen long-lived that was not built on this foundation. It is thebase, and they are the superstructure. "Pure religion and unde-filed before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless andwidows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from theworld." "Is not this the fast that I have chosen ? to loose thebands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let theoppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke ?" The ministersof this religion are all Masons who comprehend it and are devotedto it; its sacrifices to God are good works, the sacrifices of thebase and disorderly passions, the offering up of self-interest onthe altar of humanity, and perpetual efforts to attain to all themoral perfection of which man is capable.To make honor and duty the steady beacon-lights that shallguide your life-vessel over the stormy seas of time; to do thatwhich it is right to do, not because it will insure you success, orbring with it a reward, or gain the applause of men, or be "thebest policy," more prudent or more advisable; but because it isright, and therefore ought to be done; to war incessantly againsterror, intolerance, ignorance, and vice, and yet to pity those whoerr, to be tolerant even of intolerance, to teach the ignorant, andto labor to reclaim the vicious, are some of the duties of a Mason.A good Mason is one that can look upon death, and see its facewith the same countenance with which he hears its story; thatcan endure all the labors of his life with his soul supporting hisbody, that can equally despise riches when he hath them andwhen he hath them not;that is, not sadder if they are in his neigh-bor's exchequer, nor more lifted up if they shine around about hisown walls; one that is not moved with good fortune coming tohim, nor going from him; that can look upon another man's landswith equanimity and pleasure, as if they were his own; and yetlook upon his own, and use them too, just as if they were anotherman's; that neither spends his goods prodigally and foolishly, noryet keeps them avariciously and like a miser; that weighs notbenefits by weight and number, but by the mind and circumstancesof him who confers them; that never thinks his charity expen-sive, if a worthy person be the receiver; that does nothing foropinion's sake, but everything for conscience, being as careful ofhis thoughts as of his acting in markets and theatres, and in asmuch awe of himself as of a whole assembly; that is, bountifuland cheerful to his friends, and charitable and apt to forgive hisenemies; that loves his country, consults its honor, and obeys itslaws, and desires and endeavors nothing more than that he maydo his duty and honor God. And such a Mason may reckon hislife to be the life of a man, and compute his months, not bythe course of the sun, but by the zodiac and circle of his vir-tues.The whole world is but one republic, of which each nation is afamily, and every individual a child. Masonry, not in anywisederogating from the differing duties which the diversity of statesrequires, tends to create a new people, which, composed of men ofmany nations and tongues, shall all be bound together by thebonds of science, morality, and virtue.Essentially philanthropic, philosophical, and progressive, it hasfor the basis of its dogma a firm belief in the existence of Godand his providence, and of the immortality of the soul; for itsobject, the dissemination of moral, political, philosophical, andreligious truth, and the practice of all the virtues. In every age,its device has been, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," with constitu-tional government, law, order, discipline, and subordination tolegitimate authority--government and not anarchy.But it is neither a political party nor a religious sect. Itbraces all parties and all sects, to form from among them all a vastfraternal association. It recognizes the dignity of human nature,and man's right to such freedom as he is fitted for; and itknows nothing that should place one man below another, exceptignorance, debasement, and crime, and the necessity of subordina-tion to lawful will and authority.It is philanthropic; for it recognizes the great truth that allmen are of the same origin, have common interests, and shouldco-operate together to the same end.Therefore it teaches its members to love one another, to give toeach other mutual assistance and support in all the circumstancesof life, to share each other's pains and sorrows, as well as theirjoys and pleasures; to guard the reputations, respect the opinions,and be perfectly tolerant of the errors, of each other, in mattersof faith and beliefs.It is philisophical because it teaches the great Truths concern-ing the nature and existence of one Supreme Deity, and the exist-ence and immortality of the soul. It revives the Academy ofPlato and the wise teachings of Socrates. It reiterates the max-ims of Pythagoras, Confucius, and Zoroaster, and reverentiallyenforces the sublime lessons of Him who died upon the Cross.The ancients thought that universal humanity acted under theinfluence of two opposing Principles, the Good and the Evil: ofwhich the Good urged men toward Truth, Independence, and De-votedness and the Evil toward Falsehood, Servility, and Selfish-ness. Masonry represents the Good Principle and constantly warsagainst the evil one. It is the Hercules, the Osiris, the Apollo, theMithras, and the Ormuzd, at everlasting and deadly feud withthe demons of ignorance, brutality, baseness, falsehood, slavish-ness of soul, intolerance, superstition, tyranny, meanness, the in-solence of wealth, and bigotry.When despotism and superstition, twin-powers of evil and dark-ness, reigned everywhere and seemed invincible and immortal, itinvented, to avoid persecution, the mysteries, that is to say, theallegory, the symbol, and the emblem, and transmitted its doc-trines by the secret mode of initiation. Now, retaining its ancientsymbols, and in part its ancient ceremonies, it displays in everycivilized country its banner, on which in letters of living light itsgreat principles are written; and it smiles at the puny efforts ofkings and popes to crush it out by excommunication and inter-diction.Man's views in regard to God, will contain only so much posi-tive truth as the human mind is capable of receiving; whetherthat truth is attained by the exercise of reason, or communicatedby revelation. It must necessarily be both limited and alloyed, tobring it within the competence of finite human intelligence. Be-ing finite, we can form no correct or adequate idea of the Infinite;being material, we can form no clear conception of the Spiritual.We do believe in and know the infinity of Space and Time, andthe spirituality of the Soul; but the idea of that infinity andspirituality eludes us. Even Omnipotence cannot infuse infiniteconceptions into finite minds; nor can God, without first entirelychanging the conditions of our being, pour a complete and fullknowledge of His own nature and attributes into the narrowcapacity of a human soul. Human intelligence could not graspit, nor human language express it. The visible is, necessarily, themeasure of the invisible.The consciousness of the individual reveals itself alone. Hisknowledge cannot pass beyond the limits of his own being. Hisconceptions of other things and other beings are only his concep-tions. They are not those things or beings themselves. The livingprinciple of a living Universe must be INFINITE; while all ourideas and conceptions are finite, and applicable only to finite beings.The Deity is thus not an object of knowledge, but of faith; notto be approached by the understanding, but by the moral sense;not to be conceived, but to be felt. All attempts to embrace theInfinite in the conception of the Finite are, and must be only ac-commodations to the frailty of man. Shrouded from human com-prehension in an obscurity from which a chastened imagination isawed back, and Thought retreats in conscious weakness, theDivine Nature is a theme on which man is little entitled to dog-matize. Here the philosophic Intellect becomes most painfullyaware of its own insufficiency.And yet it is here that man most dogmatizes, classifies and de-scribes God's attributes, makes out his map of God's nature, andhis inventory of God's qualities, feelings, impulses, and passions;and then hangs and burns his brother, who, as dogmatically as he,makes out a different map and inventory. The common under-standing has no humility. Its God is an incarnate Divinity. Im-perfection imposes its own limitations on the Illimitable, andclothes the Inconceivable Spirit of the Universe in forms thatcome within the grasp of the senses and the intellect, and arederived from that infinite and imperfect nature which is but God'screation.We are all of us, though not all equally, mistaken. The cher-ished dogmas of each of us are not, as we fondly suppose, the puretruth of God; but simply our own special form of error, ourguesses at truth, the refracted and fragmentary rays of light thathave fallen upon our own minds. Our little systems have theirday, and cease to be; they are but broken lights of God; and Heis more than they. Perfect truth is not attainable anywhere. Westyle this Degree that of Perfection; and yet what it teaches isimperfect and defective. Yet we are not to relax in the pursuitof truth, nor contentedly acquiesce in error. It is our duty alwaysto press forward in the search; for though absolute truth is unat-tainable, yet the amount of error in our views is capable of pro-gressive and perpetual diminution; and thus Masonry is a con-tinual struggle toward the light.All errors are not equally innocuous. That which is most in-jurious is to entertain unworthy conceptions of the nature andattributes of God; and it is this that Masonry symbolizes by igno-rance of the True Word. The true word of a Mason is, not theentire, perfect, absolute truth in regard to God; but the highestand noblest conception of Him that our minds are capable offorming; and this word is Ineffable, because one man cannotcommunicate to another his own conception of Deity; since everyman's conception of God must be proportioned to his mental cul-tivation and intellectual powers, and moral excellence. God is, asman conceives Him, the reflected image of man himself.For every man's conception of God must vary with his mentalcultivation and mental powers. If any one contents himself withany lower image than his intellect is capable of grasping, then hecontents himself with that which is false to him, as well as false infact. If lower than he can reach, he must needs feel it to be false.And if we, of the nineteenth century after Christ, adopt the con-ceptions of the nineteenth century before Him; if our conceptionsof God are those of the ignorant, narrow-minded, and vindictiveIsraelite; then we think worse of God, and have a lower, meaner,and more limited view of His nature, than the faculties which Hehas bestowed are capable of grasping. The highest view we canform is nearest to the truth. If we acquiesce in any lower one,we acquiesce in an untruth. We feel that it is an affront and anindignity to Him, to conceive of Him as cruel, short-sighted, ca-pricious, and unjust; as a jealous, an angry, a vindictive Being.When we examine our conceptions of His character, if we canconceive of a loftier, nobler, higher, more beneficent, glorious, andmagnificent character, then this latter is to us the true conceptionof Deity; for nothing can be imagined more excellent than He.Religion, to obtain currency and influence with the great massof mankind, must needs be alloyed with such an amount of erroras to place it far below the standard attainable by the higherhuman capacities. A religion as pure as the loftiest and most cul-tivated human reason could discern, would not be comprehendedby, or effective over, the less educated portion of mankind. Whatis Truth to the philosopher, would not be Truth, nor have theeffect of Truth, to the peasant. The religion of the many mustnecessarily be more incorrect than that of the refined and reflectivefew, not so much in its essence as in its forms, not so much in thespiritual idea which lies latent at the bottom of it, as in the sym-bols and dogmas in which that idea is embodied. The truestreligion would, in many points, not be comprehended by the igno-rant, nor consolatory to them, nor guiding and supporting forthem. The doctrines of the Bible are often not clothed in thelanguage of strict truth, but in that which was fittest to conveyto a rude and ignorant people the practical essentials of the doc-trine. A perfectly pure faith, free from all extraneous admixtures,a system of noble theism and lofty morality, would find too littlepreparation for it in the common mind and heart, to admit ofprompt reception by the masses of mankind; and Truth mightnot have reached us, if it had not borrowed the wings of Error.The Mason regards God as a Moral Governor, as well as anOriginal Creator; as a God at hand, and not merely one afar offin the distance of infinite space, and in the remoteness of Pastor Future Eternity. He conceives of Him as taking a watchfuland presiding interest in the affairs of the world, and as influenc-ing the hearts and actions of men.To him, God is the great Source of the World of Life and Mat-ter; and man, with his wonderful corporeal and mental frame,His direct work. He believes that God has made men with differ-ent intellectual capacities, and enabled some, by superior intellect-ual power, to see and originate truths which are hidden from themass of men. He believes that when it is His will that mankindshould make some great step forward, or achieve some pregnantdiscovery, He calls into being some intellect of more than ordi-nary magnitude and power, to give birth to new ideas, andgrander conceptions of the Truths vital to Humanity.We hold that God has so ordered matters in this beautiful andharmonious, but mysteriously-governed Universe, that one greatmind after another will arise, from time to time, as such areneeded, to reveal to men the truths that are wanted, and theamount of truth than can be borne. He so arranges, that natureand the course of events shall send men into the world, endowedwith that higher mental and moral organization, in which grandtruths, and sublime gleams of spiritual light will spontaneouslyand inevitably arise. These speak to men by inspiration.Whatever Hiram really was, he is the type, perhaps an imag-inary type, to us, of humanity in its highest phase; an exemplarof what man may and should become, in the course of ages, in hisprogress toward the realization of his destiny; an individual giftedwith a glorious intellect, a noble soul, a fine organization, and aperfectly balanced moral being; an earnest of what humanity maybe, and what we believe it will hereafter be in God's good time;the possibility of the race made real.The Mason believes that God has arranged this glorious but per-plexing world with a purpose, and on a plan. He holds that everyman sent upon this earth, and especially every man of superiorcapacity, has a duty to perform, a mission to fulfill, a baptism tobe baptized with; that every great and good man possesses someportion of God's truth, which he must proclaim to the world, andwhich must bear fruit in his own bosom. In a true and simplesense, he believes all the pure, wise, and intellectual to be inspired,and to be so for the instruction, advancement, and elevation ofmankind. That kind of inspiration, like God's omnipresence, isnot limited to the few writers claimed by Jews, Christians, orMoslems, but is co-extensive with the race. It is the consequenceof a faithful use of our faculties. Each man is its subject, God isits source, and Truth its only test. It differs in degrees, as theintellectual endowments, the moral wealth of the soul, and the de-gree of cultivation of those endowments and faculties differ. It islimited to no sect, age, or nation. It is wide as the world andcommon as God. It was not given to a few men, in the infancyof mankind, to monopolize inspiration, and bar God out of thesoul. We are not born in the dotage and decay of the world. Thestars are beautiful as in their prime; the most ancient Heavensare fresh and strong. God is still everywhere in nature. Wher-ever a heart beats with love, wherever Faith and Reason uttertheir oracles, there is God, as formerly in the hearts of seers andprophets. No soil on earth is so holy as the good man's heart;nothing is so full of God. This inspiration is not given to thelearned alone, not alone to the great and wise, but to every faithfulchild of God. Certain as the open eye drinks in the light, do thepure in heart see God; and he who lives truly, feels Him as a pres-ence within the soul. The conscience is the very voice of Deity.Masonry, around whose altars the Christian, the Hebrew, theMoslem, the Brahmin, the followers of Confucius and Zoroaster,can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer to the one God whois above all the Baalim, must needs leave it to each of its Initiatesto look for the foundation of his faith and hope to the writtenscriptures of his own religion. For itself it finds those truthsdefinite enough, which are written by the finger of God upon theheart of man and on the pages of the book of nature. Views ofreligion and duty, wrought out by the meditations of the studious,confirmed by the allegiance of the good and wise, stamped assterling by the response they find in every uncorrupted mind, com-mend themselves to Masons of every creed, and may well be ac-cepted by all.The Mason does not pretend to dogmatic certainty, nor vainlyimagine such certainty attainable. He considers that if therewere no written revelation, he could safely rest the hopes that ani-mate him and the principles that guide him, on the deductions ofreason and the convictions of instinct and consciousness. He canfind a sure foundation for his religious belief, in these deductionsof the intellect and convictions of the heart. For reason provesto him the existence and attributes of God; and those spiritualinstincts which he feels are the voice of God in his soul, infuseinto his mind a sense of his relation to God, a conviction of thebeneficence of his Creator and Preserver, and a hope of future ex-istence; and his reason and conscience alike unerringly point tovirtue as the highest good, and the destined aim and purpose ofman's life.He studies the wonders of the Heavens, the frame-work andrevolutions of the Earth, the mysterious beauties and adaptationsof animal existence, the moral and material constitution of thehuman creature, so fearfully and wonderfully made; and is satis-fied that God IS; and that a Wise and Good Being is the authorof the starry Heavens above him, and of the moral world withinhim; and his mind finds an adequate foundation for its hopes, itsworship, its principles of action, in the far-stretching Universe, inthe glorious firmament, in the deep, full soul, bursting with un-utterable thoughts.These are truths which every reflecting mind will unhesitatinglyreceive, as not to be surpassed, nor capable of improvement; andfitted, if obeyed, to make earth indeed a Paradise, and man only alittle lower than the angels. The worthlessness of ceremonialobservances, and the necessity of active virtue; the enforcementof purity of heart as the security for purity of life, and of thegovernment of the thoughts, as the originators and forerunners ofaction; universal philanthropy, requiring us to love all men, andto do unto others that and that only which we should think itright, just, and generous for them to do unto us; forgiveness ofinjuries; the necessity of self-sacrifice in the discharge of duty;humility; genuine sincerity, and being that which we seem to be;all these sublime precepts need no miracle, no voice from theclouds, to recommend them to our allegiance, or to assure us oftheir divine origin. They command obedience by virtue of theirinherent rectitude and beauty; and have been, and are, and willbe the law in every age and every country of the world. Godrevealed them to man in the beginning.To the Mason, God is our Father in Heaven, to be Whoseespecial children is the sufficient reward of the peacemakers, to seeWhose face the highest hope of the pure in heart; Who is ever athand to strengthen His true worshippers; to Whom our most fer-vent love is due, our most humble and patient submission; Whosemost acceptable worship is a pure and pitying heart and a benefi-cent life; in Whose constant presence we live and act, to Whosemerciful disposal we are resigned by that death which, we hopeand believe, is but the entrance to a better life; and Whose wisedecrees forbid a man to lap his soul in an elysium of mere indolentcontent.As to our feelings toward Him and our conduct toward man,Masonry teaches little about which men can differ, and little fromwhich they can dissent. He is our Father; and we are all breth-ren. This much lies open to the most ignorant and busy, as fullyas to those who have most leisure and are most learned. Thisneeds no Priest to teach it, and no authority to indorse it; and ifevery man did that only which is consistent with it, it would exilebarbarity, cruelty, intolerance, uncharitableness, perfidy, treach-ery, revenge, selfishness, and all their kindred vices and bad pas-sions beyond the confines of the world.The true Mason, sincerely holding that a Supreme God createdand governs this world, believes also that He governs it by laws,which, though wise, just, and beneficent, are yet steady, unwaver-ing, inexorable. He believes that his agonies and sorrows are or-dained for his chastening, his strengthening, his elaboration anddevelopment; because they are the necessary results of the opera-tion of laws, the best that could be devised for the happiness andpurification of the species, and to give occasion and opportunityfor the practice of all the virtues, from the homeliest and mostcommon, to the noblest and most sublime; or perhaps not eventhat, but the best adapted to work out the vast, awful, glorious,eternal designs of the Great Spirit of the Universe. He believesthat the ordained operations of nature, which have brought miseryto him, have, from the very unswerving tranquility of theircareer, showered blessings and sunshine upon many another path;that the unrelenting chariot of Time, which has crushed or maimedhim in its allotted course, is pressing onward to the accomplish-ment of those serene and mighty purposes, to have contributed towhich, even as a victim, is an honor and a recompense. He takesthis view of Time and Nature and God, and yet bears his lot with-out murmur or distrust; because it is a portion of a system, thebest possible, because ordained by God. He does not believe thatGod loses sight of him, while superintending the march of thegreat harmonies of the Universe; nor that it was not foreseen,when the Universe was created, its laws enacted, and the long suc-cession of its operations pre-ordained, that in the great march ofthose events, he would suffer pain and undergo calamity. He be-lieves that his individual good entered into God's consideration, aswell as the great cardinal results to which the course of all thingsis tending.Thus believing, he has attained an eminence in virtue, the high-est, amid passive excellence, which humanity can reach. He findshis reward and his support in the reflection that he is an unreluc-tant and self-sacrificing co-operator with the Creator of the Uni-verse; and in the noble consciousness of being worthy and capableof so sublime a conception, yet so sad a destiny. He is then trulyentitled to be called a Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.He is content to fall early in the battle, if his body may but forma stepping-stone for the future conquests of humanity.It cannot be that God, Who, we are certain, is perfectly good,can choose us to suffer pain, unless either we are ourselves to re-ceive from it an antidote to what is evil in ourselves, or else assuch pain is a necessary part in the scheme of the Universe, whichas a whole is good. In either case, the Mason receives it withsubmission. He would not suffer unless it was ordered so. What-ever his creed, if he believes that God is, and that He cares forHis creatures, he cannot doubt that; nor that it would not havebeen so ordered, unless it was either better for himself, or forsome other persons, or for some things. To complain and lamentis to murmur against God's will, and worse than unbelief.The Mason, whose mind is cast in a nobler mould than those ofthe ignorant and unreflecting, and is instinct with a diviner life,-who loves truth more than rest, and the peace of Heaven ratherthan the peace of Eden,--to whom a loftier being brings severercares,--who knows that man does not live by pleasure or contentalone, but by the presence of the power of God,--must cast be-hind him the hope of any other repose or tranquillity, than thatwhich is the last reward of long agonies of thought; he must re-linquish all prospect of any Heaven save that of which trouble isthe avenue and portal; he must gird up his loins, and trim hislamp, for a work that must be done, and must not be negligentlydone. If he does not like to live in the furnished lodgings of tra-dition, he must build his own house, his own system of faith andthought, for himself.The hope of success, and not the hope of reward, should be ourstimulating and sustaining power. Our object, and not ourselves,should be our inspiring thought. Selfishness is a sin, when tem-porary, and for time. Spun out to eternity, it does not becomecelestial prudence. We should toil and die, not for Heaven orBliss, but for Duty.In the more frequent cases, where we have to join our efforts tothose of thousands of others, to contribute to the carrying forwardof a great cause; merely to till the ground or sow the seed for avery distant harvest, or to prepare the way for the future adventof some great amendment; the amount which each one contrib-utes to the achievement of ultimate success, the portion of theprice which justice should assign to each as his especial produc-tion, can never be accurately ascertained. Perhaps few of thosewho have ever labored, in the patience of secrecy and silence, tobring about some political or social change, which they felt con-vinced would ultimately prove of vast service to humanity, livedto see the change effected, or the anticipated good flow from it.Fewer still of them were able to pronounce what appreciableweight their several efforts contributed to the achievement of thechange desired. Many will doubt, whether, in truth, these exer-tions have any influence whatever; and, discouraged, cease allactive effort.Not to be thus discouraged, the Mason must labor to elevateand purify his motives, as well as sedulously cherish the convic-tion, assuredly a true one, that in this world there is no such thingas effort thrown away; that in all labor there is profit; that allsincere exertion, in a righteous and unselfish cause, is necessarilyfollowed, in spite of all appearance to the contrary, by an appro-priate and proportionate success; that no bread cast upon thewaters can be wholly lost; that no seed planted in the ground canfail to quicken in due time and measure; and that, however wemay, in moments of despondency, be apt to doubt, not onlywhether our cause will triumph, but whether, if it does, we shallhave contributed to its triumph,--there is One, Who has notonly seen every exertion we have made, but Who can assignthe exact degree in which each soldier has assisted to gain thegreat victory over social evil. No good work is done wholly invain.The Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason will in nowisedeserve that honorable title, if he has not that strength, that will,that self-sustaining energy; that Faith, that feeds upon no earthlyhope, nor ever thinks of victory, but, content in its own consum-mation, combats, because it ought to combat, rejoicing fights, andstill rejoicing falls.The Augean Stables of the World, the accumulated uncleannessand misery of centuries, require a mighty river to cleanse themthoroughly away; every drop we contribute aids to swell thatriver and augment its force, in a degree appreciable by God,though not by man; and he whose zeal is deep and earnest, willnot be over-anxious that his individual drops should be distin-guishable amid the mighty mass of cleansing and fertilizingwaters; far less that, for the sake of distinction, it should flow inineffective singleness away.The true Mason will not be careful that his name should beinscribed upon the mite which he casts into the treasury of God.It suffices him to know that if he has labored, with purity of pur-pose, in any good cause, he must have contributed to its success;that the degree in which he has contributed is a matter of infi-nitely small concern; and still more, that the consciousness ofhaving so contributed, however obscurely and unnoticed, is hissufficient, even if it be his sole, reward. Let every Grand Elect,Perfect, and Sublime Mason cherish this faith. It is a duty. Itis the brilliant and never-dying light that shines within andthrough the symbolic pedestal of alabaster, on which reposes theperfect cube of agate, symbol of duty, inscribed with the divinename of God. He who industriously sows and reaps is a goodlaborer, and worthy of his hire. But he who sows that whichshall be reaped by others, by those who will know not of and carenot for the sower, is a laborer of a nobler order, and, worthy of amore excellent reward.The Mason does not exhort others to an ascetic undervaluingof this life, as an insignificant and unworthy portion of existence;for that demands feelings which are unnatural, and which, there-fore, if attained, must be morbid, and if merely professed, insin-cere; and teaches us to look rather to a future life for the com-pensation of social evils, than to this life for their cure; and sodoes injury to the cause of virtue and to that of social progress.Life is real, and is earnest, and it is full of duties to be performed.It is the beginning of our immortality. Those only who feel adeep interest and affection for this world will work resolutely forits amelioration; those whose affections are transferred to Heaven,easily acquiesce in the miseries of earth, deeming them hopeless,befitting, and ordained; and console themselves with the idea ofthe ammends which are one day to be theirs. It is a sad truth, thatthose most decidedly given to spiritual contemplation, and tomaking religion rule in their hearts, are often most apathetic to-ward all improvement of this world's systems, and in many casesvirtual conservatives of evil, and hostile to political and social re-form, as diverting men's energies from eternity.The Mason does not war with his own instincts, macerate thebody into weakness and disorder, and disparage what he sees to bebeautiful, knows to be wonderful, and feels to be unspeakablydear and fascinating. He does not put aside the nature whichGod has given him, to struggle after one which He has not be-stowed. He knows that man is sent into the world, not a spir-itual, but a composite being, made up of body and mind, the bodyhaving, as is fit and needful in a material world, its full, rightful,and allotted share. His life is guided by a full recognition of thisfact. He does not deny it in bold words, and admit it in weak-nesses and inevitable failings. He believes that his spiritualitywill come in the next stage of his being, when he puts on the spir-itual body; that his body will be dropped at death; and that, untilthen, God meant it to be commanded and controlled, but not neg-lected, despised, or ignored by the soul, under pain of heavy con-sequences. Yet the Mason is not indifferent as to the fate of the soul, afterits present life, as to its continued and eternal being, and the char-acter of the scenes in which that being will be fully developed.These are to him topics of the proroundest interest, and the mostennobling and refining contemplation. They occupy much of hisleisure; and as he becomes familiar with the sorrows and calami-ties of this life, as his hopes are disappointed and his visions ofhappiness here fade away; when life has wearied him in itsrace of hours; when he is harassed and toil-worn, and the bur-den of his years weighs heavy on him, the balance of attractiongradually inclines in favor of another life; and he clings to hislofty speculations with a tenacity of interest which needs no in-junction, and will listen to no prohibition. They are the consol-ing privilege of the aspiring, the wayworn, the weary, and thebereaved.To him the contemplation of the Future lets in light upon thePresent, and develops the higher portions of his nature. He en-deavors rightly to adjust the respective claims of Heaven andearth upon his time and thought, so as to give the proper propor-tions thereof to performing the duties and entering into the inter-ests of this world, and to preparation for a better; to the cultiva-tion and purification of his own character, and to the public serviceof his fellow-men.The Mason does not dogmatize, but entertaining and utteringhis own convictions, he leaves every one else free to do the same;and only hopes that the time will come, even if after the lapse ofages, when all men shall form one great family of brethren, andone law alone, the law of love, shall govern God's whole Uni-verse.Believe as you may, my brother; if the Universe is not, to you,without a God, and if man is not like the beast that perishes, buthath an immortal soul, we welcome you among us, to wear, as wewear, with humility, and conscious of your demerits and short-comings, the title of Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.It is not without a secret meaning, that twelve was the num-ber of the Apostles of Christ, and seventy-two that of his Dis-ciples: that John addressed his rebukes and menaces to the Sevenchurches, the number of the Archangels and the Planets. AtBabylon were the Seven Stages of Bersippa, a pyramid of Sevenstories, and at Ecbatana Seven concentric inclosures, each of adifferent color. Thebes also had Seven gates, and the same num-ber is repeated again and again in the account of the flood. TheSephiroth, or Emanations, ten in number, three in one class, andseven in the other, repeat the mystic numbers of Pythagoras.Seven Amschaspands or planetary spirits were invoked withOrmuzd: Seven inferior Rishis of Hindustan were saved with thehead of their family in an ark: and Seven ancient personagesalone returned with the British just man, Hu, from the dale ofthe grievous waters. There were Seven Heliadae, whose fatherHelias, or the Sun, once crossed the sea in a golden cup; SevenTitans, children of the older Titan, Kronos or Saturn; SevenCorybantes; and Seven Cabiri, sons of Sydyk; Seven primevalCelestial spirits of the Japanese, and Seven Karlesters whoescaped from the deluge and began to be the parents of a newrace, on the summit of Mount Albordi. Seven Cyclopes, also,built the walls of Tiryus.Celus, as quoted by Origen, tells us that the Persians repre-sented by symbols the two-fold motion of the stars, fixed andplanetary, and the passage of the Soul through their successivespheres. They erected in their holy caves, in which the mysticrites of the Mithriac Initiations were practised, what he denomi-nates a high ladder, on the Seven steps of which were Sevengates or portals, according to the number of the Seven principalheavenly bodies. Through these the aspirants passed, until theyreached the summit of the whole; and this passage was styled atransmigration through the spheres.Jacob saw in his dream a ladder planted or set on the earth,and its top reaching to Heaven, and the Malaki Alohim ascendingand descending on it, and above it stood IHUH, declaring Himselfto be Ihuh-Alhi Abraham. The word translated ladder, isSalam, from Salal, raised, elevated, reared up, exalted, piledup into a heap, Aggeravit. Salalah, means a heap, rampart,or other accumulation of earth or stone, artificially made; andSalaa or Salo, is a rock or cliff or boulder, and the name ofthe city of Petra. There is no ancient Hebrew word to designatea pyramid.The symbolic mountain Meru was ascended by Seven steps orstages; and all the pyramids and artificial tumuli and hillocksthrown up in flat countries were imitations of this fabulous andmystic mountain, for purposes of worship. These were the "HighPlaces" so often mentioned in the Hebrew books, on which theidolaters sacrificed to foreign gods.The pyramids were sometimes square, and sometimes round.The sacred Babylonian tower [Magdol], dedicated to thegreat Father Bal, was an artificial hill, of pyramidal shape, andSeven stages, built of brick, and each stage of a different color,representing the Seven planetary spheres by the appropriate colorof each planet. Meru itself was said to be a single mountain, ter-minating in three peaks, and thus a symbol of the Trimurti. Thegreat Pagoda at Tanjore was of six stories, surmounted by a tem-ple as the seventh, and on this three spires or towers. An ancientpagoda at Deogur was surmounted by a tower, sustaining themystic egg and a trident. Herodotus tells us that the Temple ofBal at Babylon was a tower composed of Seven towers, resting onan eighth that served as basis, and successively diminishing insize from the bottom to the top; and Strabo tells us it was apyramid.Faber thinks that the Mithriac ladder was really a pyramid withSeven stages, each provided with a narrow door or aperture,through each of which doors the aspirant passed, to reach thesummit, and then descended through similar doors on the oppositeside of the pyramid; the ascent and descent of the Soul beingthus represented.Each Mithriac cave and all the most ancient temples weretended to symbolize the Universe, which itself was habituallycalled the Temple and habitation of Deity. Every temple wasthe world in miniature; and so the whole world was one grandtemple. The most ancient temples were roofless; and thereforethe Persians, Celts, and Scythians strongly disliked artificial cov-ered edifices. Cicero says that Xerxes burned the Grecian tem-ples, on the express ground that the whole world was the Magnifi-cent Temple and Habitation of the Supreme Deity. Macrobiussays that the entire Universe was judiciously deemed by many theTemple of God. Plato pronounced the real Temple of the Deityto be the world; and Heraclitus declared that the Universe, varie-gated with animals and plants and stars was the only genuineTemple of the Divinity.How completely the Temple of Solomon was symbolic, ismanifest, not only from the continual reproduction in it ofthe sacred numbers and of astrological symbols in the histor-ical descriptions of it; but also, and yet more, from the de-tails of the imaginary reconstructed edifice, seen by Ezekielin his vision. The Apocalypse completes the demonstration,and shows the kabalistic meanings of the whole. The Sym-bola Architectonica are found on the most ancient edifices;and these mathematical figures and instruments, adopted bythe Templars, and identical with those on the gnostic seals andabraxae, connect their dogma with the Chaldaic, Syriac, andEgyptian Oriental philosophy. The secret Pythagorean doc-trines of numbers were preserved by the monks of Thibet, bythe Hierophants of Egypt and Eleusis, at Jerusalem, and inthe circular Chapters of the Druids; and they are especiallyconsecrated in that mysterious book, the Apocalypse of SaintJohn.All temples were surrounded by pillars, recording the numberof the constellations, the signs of the zodiac, or the cycles of theplanets; and each one was a microcosm or symbol of the Universe,having for roof or ceiling the starred vault of Heaven.All temples were originally open at the top, having for roof thesky. Twelve pillars described the belt of the zodiac. Whateverthe number of the pillars, they were mystical everywhere. AtAbury, the Druidic temple reproduced all the cycles by its col-umns. Around the temples of Chilminar in Persia, of Baalbec,and of Tukhti Schlomoh in Tartary, on the frontier of China,stood forty pillars. On each side of the temple at Paestum werefourteen, recording the Egyptian cycle of the dark and light sidesof the moon, as described by Plutarch; the whole thirty-eightthat surrounded them recording the two meteoric cycles so oftenfound in the Druidic temples.The theatre built by Scaurus, in Greece, was surrounded by360 columns; the Temple at Mecca, and that at Iona in Scotland,by 360 stones.

XII. GRAND MASTER ARCHITECT. [Master Architect.] THE great duties that are inculcated by the lessons taught by the workinginstruments of a Grand Master Architect, demanding so much of us, and taking for granted the capacity to perform them faithfully and fully, bring us at once to reflect upon the dignity of human nature, and the vast powers and capacities of the human soul; and to that theme we invite your attention in this Degree. Let us begin to rise from earth toward the Stars. Evermore the human soul struggles toward the light, toward God, and the Infinite. It is especially so in its afflictions. Words go but a little way into the depths of sorrow. The thoughts that writhe there in silence, that go into the stillness of Infinitude and Eternity, have no emblems. Thoughts enough come there, such as no tongue ever uttered. They do not so much want human sympathy, as higher help. There is a loneliness in deep sorrow which the Deity alone can relieve. Alone, the mind wrestles with the great problem of calamity, and seeks the solution from the Infinite Providence of Heaven, and thus is led directly to God. There are many things in us of which we are not distinctly conscious. To waken that slumbering consciousness into life, and so to lead the soul up to the Light, is one office of every great ministration to human nature, whether its vehicle be the pen, the pencil, or the tongue. We are unconscious of the intensity and awfulness of the life within us. Health and sickness, joy and sorrow, success and disappointment, life and death, love and loss, are familiar words upon our lips; and we do not know to what depths they point within us. We seem never to know what any thing means or is worth until we have lost it. Many an organ, nerve, and fibre in our bodily frame performs its silent part for years, and we are quite unconscious of its value. It is not until it is injured that we discover that value, and find how essential it was to our happiness and comfort. We never know the full significance of the words “property," "ease," and "health;" the wealth of meaning in the fond epithets, "parent,” “child," "beloved," and "friend," until the thing or the person is taken away; until, in place of the bright, visible being, comes the awful and desolate shadow, where nothing is: where we stretch out our hands in vain, and strain our eyes upon dark and dismal vacuity. Yet, in that vacuity, we do not lose the object that we loved. It becomes only the more real to us. Our blessings not only brighten when they depart, but are fixed in enduring reality; and love and friendship receive their everlasting seal under the cold impress of death. A dim consciousness of infinite mystery and grandeur lies beneath all the commonplace of life. There is an awfulness and a majesty around us, in all our little worldliness. The rude peasant from the Apennines, asleep at the foot of a pillar in a majestic Roman church, seems not to hear or see, but to, dream only of the herd he feeds or the ground he tills in the mountains. But the choral symphonies fall softly upon his ear, and the gilded arches are dimly seen through his half-slumbering eyelids. So the soul, however given up to the occupations of daily life, cannot quite lose the sense of where it is, and of what is above it and around it. The scene of its actual engagements may be small; the path of its steps, beaten and familiar; the objects it handles, easily spanned, and quite worn out with daily uses. So it may be, and amidst such things that we all live. So we live our little life; but Heaven is above us and all around and close to us; and Eternity is before us and behind us; and suns and stars are silent witnesses and watchers over us. We are enfolded by Infinity. Infinite Powers and Infinite spaces lie all around us. The dread arch of Mystery spreads over us, and no voice ever pierced it. Eternity is enthroned amid Heaven's myriad starry heights; and no utterance or word ever came from those far-off and silent spaces. Above, is that awful majesty; around us, everywhere, it stretches off into infinity; and beneath it is this little struggle of life, this poor day's conflict, this busy ant-hill of Time. But from that ant-hill, not only the talk of the streets, the sounds of music and revelling, the stir and tread of a multitude, the shout of joy and the shriek of agony go up into the silent and all-surrounding Infinitude; but also, amidst the stir and noise of visible life, from the inmost bosom of the visible man, there goes up an imploring call, a beseeching cry, an asking, unuttered, and unutterable, for revelation, wailingly and in almost speechless agony praying the dread arch of mystery to break, and the stars that roll above the waves of mortal trouble, to speak; the enthroned majesty of those awful heights to find a voice; the mysterious and reserved heavens to come near; and all to tell us what they alone know; to give us information of the loved and lost; to make known to us what we are, and whither we are going. Man is encompassed with a dome of incomprehensible wonders. In him and about him is that which should fill his life with majesty and sacredness. Something of sublimity and sanctity has thus flashed down from heaven into the heart of every one that lives. There is no being so base and abandoned but hath some traits of that sacredness left upon him; something, so much perhaps in discordance with his general repute, that he hides it from all around him; some sanctuary in his soul, where no one may enter; some sacred inclosure, where the memory of a child is, or the image of a venerated parent, or the remembrance of a pure love, or the echo of some word of kindness once spoken to him; an echo that will never die away. Life is no negative, or superficial or worldly existence. Our steps are evermore haunted with thoughts, far beyond their own range, which some have regarded as the reminiscences of a preexistent state. So it is with us all, in the beaten and worn track of this worldly pilgrimage. There is more here, than the world we live in. It is not all of life to live. An unseen and infinite presence is here; a sense of something greater than we possess; a seeking, through all the void wastes of life, for a good beyond it; a crying out of the heart for interpretation; a memory of the dead, touching continually some vibrating thread in this great tissue of mystery. We all not only have better intimations, but are capable of better thingsthan we know. The pressure of some great emergency would develop in us powers, beyond the worldly bias of our spirits; and Heaven so deals with us, from time to time, as to call forth those better things. There is hardly a family in the world go selfish, but that, if one in it were doomed to die - one, to be selected by the others, - it would be utterly impossible for its members, parents and children, to choose out that victim; but that each would say, "I will die; but I cannot choose." And in how many, if that dire extremity had come, would not one and another step forth, freed from the vile meshes of ordinary selfishness, and say, like the Roman father and son, "Let the blow fall on me!" There are greater and better things in us all, than the world takes account of, or than we take note of; if we would but find them out. And it is one part of our Masonic culture to find these traits of power and sublime devotion, to revive these faded impressions of generosity and self-sacrifice, the almost squandered bequests of God's love and kindness to our souls; and to induce us to yield ourselves to their guidance and control. Upon all conditions of men presses down one impartial law. To all situations, to all fortunes, high or low, the mind gives their character. They are, in effect, not what they are in themselves, but what they are to the feeling of their possessors. The King may be mean, degraded, miserable; the slave of ambition, fear, voluptuousness, and every low passion. The Peasant may be the real Monarch, the moral master of his fate, a free and lofty being, more than a Prince in happiness, more than a King in honor. Man is no bubble upon the sea of his fortunes, helpless and irresponsible upon the tide of events. Out of the same circumstances, different men bring totally different results. The same difficulty, distress, poverty, or misfortune, that breaks down one man, builds up another and makes him strong. It is the very attribute and glory of a man, that he can bend the circumstances of his condition to the intellectual and moral purposes of his nature, and it is the power and mastery of his will that chiefly distinguish him from the brute. The faculty of moral will, developed in the child, is a new element of his nature. It is a new power brought upon the scene, and a ruling power, delegated from Heaven. Never was a human being sunk so low that he had not, by God's gift, the power to rise, Because God commands him to rise, it is certain that he can rise.Every man has the power, and should use it, to make all situations, trials, and temptations instruments to promote his virtue and happiness; and is so far from being the creature of circumstances, that he creates and controls them, making them to be all that they are, of evil or of good, to him as a moral being. Life is what we make it, and the world is what we make it. The eyes of the cheerful and of the melancholy man are fixed upon the same creation; but very different are the aspects which it bears to them. To the one, it is all beauty and gladness; the waves of ocean roll in light, and the mountains are covered with day. Life, to him, flashes, rejoicing, upon every flower and every tree that trembles in the breeze. There is more to him, everywhere, than the eye sees; a presence of profound joy on hill and valley, and bright, dancing water. The other idly or mournfully gazes at the same scene, and everything wears a dull, dim, and sickly aspect. The murmuring of the brooks is a discord to him, the great roar of the sea has an angry and threatening emphasis, the solemn music of the pines sings the requiem of his departed happiness; the cheerful light shines garishly upon his eyes and offends him. The great train of the seasons passes before him like a funeral procession; and he sighs, and turns impatiently away. The eye makes that which it looks upon; the ear makes its own melodies and discords; the world without reflects the world within. Let the Mason never forget that life and the world are what we make them by our social character; by our adaptation, or want of adaptation to the social conditions, relationships, and pursuits of the world. To the selfish, the cold, and the insensible, to the haughty and presuming, to the proud, who demand more than they are likely to receive, to the jealous, ever afraid they shall not receive enough, to those who are unreasonably sensitive about the good or ill opinions of others, to all violators of the social laws, the rude, the violent, the dishonest, and the sensual, - to all these, the social condition, from its very nature, will present annoyances, disappointments, and pains, appropriate to their several characters. The benevolent affections will not revolve around selfishness; the cold-hearted must expect to meet coldness; the proud, haughtiness; the passionate, anger; and the violent, rudeness. Those who forget the rights of others, must not be surprised if their own are forgotten; and those who stoop to the lowest embraces of sense must not wonder, if others are not concerned to find their prostrate honor, and lift it up to the remembranceand respect of the world. To the gentle, many will be gentle; to the kind, many will be kind. A good man will find that there is goodness in the world; an honest man will find that there is honesty in the world; and a man of principle will find principle and integrity in the minds of others. There are no blessings which the mind may not convert into the bitterest of evils; and no trials which it may not transform into the noblest and divinest blessings. There are no temptations from which assailed virtue may not gain strength, instead of falling before them, vanquished and subdued. It is true that temptations have a great power, and virtue often falls; but the might of these temptations lies not in themselves, but in the feebleness of our own virtue, and the weakness of our own hearts. We rely too much on the strength of our ramparts and bastions, and allow the enemy to make his approaches, by trench and parallel, at his leisure. The offer of dishonest gain and guilty pleasure makes the honest man more honest, and the pure man more pure. They raise his virtue to the height of towering indignation. The fair occasion, the safe opportunity, the tempting chance become the defeat and disgrace of the tempter. The honest and upright man does not wait until temptation has made its approaches and mounted its batteries on the last parallel. But to the impure, the dishonest, the false-hearted, the corrupt, and the sensual, occasions come every day, and in every scene, and through every avenue of thought and imagination. He is prepared to capitulate before the first approach is commenced; and sends out the white flag when the enemy's advance comes in sight of his walls. He makes occasions; or, if opportunities come not, evil thoughts come, and he throws wide open the gates of his heart and welcomes those bad visitors, and entertains them with a lavish hospitality. The business of the world absorbs, corrupts, and degrades one mind, while in another it feeds and nurses the noblest independence, integrity, and generosity. Pleasure is a poison to some, and a healthful refreshment to others. To one, the world is a great harmony, like a noble strain of music with infinite modulations; to another, it is a huge factory, the clash and clang of whose machinery jars upon his ears and frets him to madness. Life is substantiallythe same thing to all who partake of its lot. Yet some rise to virtue and glory; while others, undergoing the same discipline, and enjoying the same privileges, sink to shame and perdition. Thorough, faithful, and honest endeavor to improve, is always successful, and the highest happiness. To sigh sentimentally over human misfortune, is fit only for the mind's childhood; and the mind's misery is chiefly its own fault; appointed, under the good Providence of God, as the punisher and corrector of its fault. In the long run, the mind will be happy, just in proportion to its fidelity and wisdom. When it is miserable, it has planted the thorns in its own path; it grasps them, and cries out in loud complaint;. and that complaint is but the louder confession that the thorns which grew there, it planted. A certain kind and degree of spirituality enter into the largest part of even the most ordinary life. You can carry on no business, without some faith in man. You cannot even dig in the ground, without a reliance on the unseen result. You cannot think or reason or even step, without confiding in the inward, spiritual principles of your nature. All the affections and bonds, and hopes and interests of life centre in the spiritual; and you know that if that central bond were broken, the world would rush to chaos. Believe that there is a God; that He is our father; that He has a paternal interest in our welfare and improvement; that He has given us powers, by means of which we may escape from sin and ruin; that He has destined us to a future life of endless progress toward perfection and a knowledge of Himself - believe this, as every Mason should, and you can live calmly, endure patiently, labor resolutely, deny yourselves cheerfully, hope steadfastly, and be conquerors in the great struggle of life. Take away any one of these principles, and what remains for us? Say that there is no God; or no way opened for hope and reformation and triumph, no heaven to come, no rest for the weary, no home in the bosom of God for the afflicted and disconsolate soul; or that God is but an ugly blind Chance that stabs in the dark; or a somewhat that is, when attempted to be defined, a nowhat, emotionless, passionless, the Supreme Apathy to which all things, good and evil, are alike indifferent; or a jealous God who revengefully visits the sins of the fathers on the children, and when the fathers have eatensour grapes, sets the children's teeth on edge; an arbitrary supreme Will, that has made it right to be virtuous, and wrong to lie and steal, because IT pleased to make it so rather than otherwise, retaining the power to reverse the law; or a fickle, vacillating, inconstant Deity, or a cruel, bloodthirsty, savage Hebrew or Puritanic one; and we are but the sport of chance and the victims of despair; hapless wanderers upon the face of a desolate, forsaken, or accursed and hated earth; surrounded by darkness, struggling with obstacles, toiling for barren results and empty purposes, distracted with doubts, and misled by false gleams of light; wanderers with no way, no prospect, no home; doomed and deserted mariners on a dark and stormy sea, without compass or course, to whom no stars appear; tossing helmless upon the weltering, angry waves, with no blessed haven in the distance whose guiding-star invites us to its welcome rest. The religious faith thus taught by Masonry is indispensable to the attainment of the great ends of life; and must therefore have been designed to be a part of it. We are made for this faith; and there must be something, somewhere, for us to believe in. We cannot grow healthfully, nor live happily, without it. It is therefore true. If we could cut off from any soul all the principles taught by Masonry, the faith in a God, in immortality, in virtue, in essential rectitude, that soul would sink into sin, misery, darkness, and ruin. If we could cut off all sense of these truths, the man would sink at once to the grade of the animal. No man can suffer and be patient, can struggle and conquer, can improve and be happy, otherwise than as the swine are, without conscience, without hope, without a reliance on a just, wise, and beneficent God. We must, of necessity, embrace the great truths taught by Masonry, and live by them, to live happily. "I put my trust in God," is the protest of Masonry against the belief in a cruel, angry, and revengeful God, to be feared and not reverenced by His creatures. Society, in its great relations, is as much the creation of Heaven as is the system of the Universe. If that bond of gravitation that holds all worlds and systems together, were suddenly severed, the universe would fly into wild and boundless chaos. And if we were to sever all the moral bonds that hold society together; if we could cut off from it every conviction of Truth and Integrity, of an authority above it, and of a conscience within it, it would immediately rush to disorder and frightful anarchy and ruin. The religion we teach is therefore as really a principle of things, and as certain and true, as gravitation. Faith in moral principles, in virtue, and in God, is as necessary for the guidance of a man, as instinct is for the guidance of an animal. And therefore this faith, as a principle of man's nature, has a mission as truly authentic in God's Providence, as the principle of instinct. The pleasures of the soul, too, must depend on certain principles. They must recognize a soul, its properties and responsibilities, a conscience, and the sense of an authority above us; and these are the principles of faith. No man can suffer and be patient, can struggle and conquer, can improve and be happy, without conscience, without hope, without a reliance on a just, wise, and beneficent God. We must of necessity embrace the great truths taught by Masonry, and live by them, to live happily. Everything in the universe has fixed and certain laws and principles for its action;- the star in its orbit, the animal in its activity, the physical man in his functions. And he has likewise fixed and certain laws and principles as a spiritual being. His soul does not die for want of aliment or guidance. For the rational soul there is ample provision. From the lofty pine, rocked in the darkening tempest, the cry of the young raven is heard; and it would be most strange if there were no answer for the cry and call of the soul, tortured by want and sorrow and agony. The total rejection of all moral and religious belief would strike out a principle from human nature, as essential to it as gravitation to the stars, instinct to animal life, the circulation of the blood to the human body. God has ordained that life shall be a social state. We are members of a civil community. The life of that community depends upon its moral condition. Public spirit, intelligence, uprightness, temperance, kindness, domestic purity, will make it a happy community, and give it prosperity and continuance. Wide-spread selfishness, dishonesty, intemperance, libertinism, corruption, and crime, will make it miserable, and bring about dissolution and speedy ruin. A whole people lives one life; one mighty heart heaves in its bosom; it is one great pulse of existence that throbs there. One stream of life flows there, with ten thousand intermingled branches and channels, through all the homes of human love. One sound as of many waters, a rapturous jubilee or a mournful sighing, comes up fromthe congregated dwellings of a whole nation. The Public is no vague abstraction; nor should that which is done against that Public, against public interest, law, or virtue, press but lightly on the conscience. It is but a vast expansion of individual life; an ocean of tears, an atmosphere of sighs, or a great whole of joy and gladness. It suffers with the suffering of millions; it rejoices with the joy of millions. What a vast crime does he commit, - private man or public man, agent or contractor, legislator or magistrate, secretary or president,-who dares, with indignity and wrong, to strike the bosom of the Public Welfare, to encourage venality and corruption, and shameful sale of the elective franchise, or of office; to sow dissension, and to weaken the bonds of amity that bind a Nation together! What a huge iniquity, he who, with vices like the daggers of a parricide, dares to pierce that mighty heart, in which the ocean of existence is flowing! What an unequalled interest lies in the virtue of every one whom we love! In his virtue, nowhere but in his virtue, is garnered up the incomparable treasure. What care we for brother or friend, compared with what we care for his honor, his fidelity, his reputation, his kindness? How venerable is the rectitude of a parent! How sacred his reputation! No blight that can fall upon a child, is like a parent's dishonor. Heathen or Christian, every parent would have his child do well; and pours out upon him all the fullness of parental love, in the one desire that he may do well; that he may be worthy of his cares, and his freely bestowed pains; that he may walk in the way of honor and happiness. In that way he cannot walk one step without virtue. Such is life, in its relationships. A thousand ties embrace it, like the fine nerves of a delicate organization; like the strings of an instrument capable of sweet melodies, but easily put out of tune or broken, by rudeness, anger, and selfish indulgence. If life could, by any process, be made insensible to pain and pleasure; if the human heart were hard as adamant, then avarice, ambition, and sensuality might channel out their paths in it, and make it their beaten way; and none would wonder or protest. If we could be patient under the load of a mere worldly life; if we could bear that burden as the beasts bear it; then, like beasts, we might bend all our thoughts to the earth; and no call from the great Heavens above us would startle us from our plodding and earthly course. But we art not insensible brutes, who can refuse the call of reason and conscience. The soul is capable of remorse. When the great dispensations of life press down upon us, we weep, and suffer and sorrow. And sorrow and agony desire other companionships than worldliness and irreligion. We are not willing to bear those burdens of the heart, fear, anxiety, disappointment, and trouble, without any object or use. We are not willing to suffer, to be sick and afflicted, to have our days and months lost to comfort and joy, and overshadowed with calamity and grief, without advantage or compensation; to barter away the dearest treasures, the very sufferings, of the heart; to sell the life-blood from failing frame and fading cheek, our tears of bitterness and groans of anguish, for nothing. Human nature, frail, feeling, sensitive, and sorrowing, cannot bear to suffer for nought. Everywhere, human life is a great and solemn dispensation. Man, suffering, enjoying, loving, hating, hoping, and fearing, chained to the earth and yet exploring the far recesses of the universe, has the power to commune with God and His angels. Around this great action of existence the curtains of Time are drawn; but there are openings through them which give us glimpses of eternity. God looks down upon this scene of human probation. The wise and the good in all ages have interposed for it with their teachings and their blood. Everything that exists around us, every movement in nature every counsel of Providence, every interposition of God, centres upon one point - the fidelity of man. And even if the ghosts of the departed and remembered could come at midnight through the barred doors of our dwellings, and the shrouded dead should glide through the aisles of our churches and sit in our Masonic Temples, their teachings would be no more eloquent and impressive than the Great realities of life; than those memories of misspent years, those ghosts of departed opportunities, that, pointing to our conscience and eternity cry continually in our ears, "Work while the day lasts! for the night of death cometh, in which no man can work.” There are no tokens of public mourning for the calamity of the soul. Men weep when the body dies; and when it is borne to its last rest, they follow it with sad and mournful procession. Butfor the dying soul there is no open lamentation; for the lost soul there are no obsequies. And yet the mind and soul of man have a value which nothing else has. They are worth a care which nothing else is worth; and to the single, solitary individual, they ought to possess an interest which nothing else possesses. The stored treasures of the heart, the unfathomable mines that are in the soul to be wrought, the broad and boundless realms of Thought, the freighted argosy of man's hopes and best affections, are brighter than gold and dearer than treasure. And yet the mind is in reality little known or considered. It is all which man permanently is, his inward being, his divine energy, his immortal thought, his boundless capacity, his infinite aspiration; and nevertheless, few value it for what it is worth. Few see a brother-mind in others, through the rags with which poverty has clothed it, beneath the crushing burdens of life, amidst the close pressure of worldly troubles, wants and sorrows. Few acknowledge and cheer it in that humble blot, and feel that the nobility of earth, and the commencing glory of Heaven are there. Men do not feel the worth of their own souls. They are proud of their mental powers; but the intrinsic, inner, infinite worth of their own minds they do not perceive. The poor man, admitted to a palace, feels, lofty and immortal being as he is, like a mere ordinary thing amid the splendors that surround him. He sees the carriage of wealth roll by him, and forgets the intrinsic and eternal dignity of his own mind in a poor and degrading envy, and feels as an humbler creature, because others are above him, not in mind, but in mensuration. Men respect themselves, according as they are more wealthy, higher in rank or office, loftier in the world's opinion, able to command more votes, more the favorites of the people or of Power. The difference among men is not so much in their nature and intrinsic power, as in the faculty of communication. Some have the capacity of uttering and embodying in words their thoughts. All men, more or less, feel those thoughts. The glory of genius and the rapture of virtue, when rightly revealed, are diffused and shared among unnumbered minds. When eloquence and poetry speak; when those glorious arts, statuary, painting, and music, take audible or visible shape; when patriotism, charity, and virtuespeak with a thrilling potency, the hearts of thousands glow with a kindred joy and ecstasy. If it were not so, there would be no eloquence; for eloquence is that to which other hearts respond; it is the faculty and power of making other hearts respond. No one is so low or degraded, as not sometimes to be touched with the beauty of goodness. No heart is made of materials so common, or even base, as not sometimes to respond, through every chord of it, to the call of honor, patriotism, generosity, and virtue. The poor African Slave will die for the master. or mistress, or in defence of the children, whom he loves. The poor, lost, scorned, abandoned, outcast woman will, without expectation of reward nurse those who are dying on every hand, utter strangers to her, with a contagious and horrid pestilence. The pickpocket will scale burning walls to rescue child or woman, unknown to him, from the ravenous flames. Most glorious is this capacity! A power to commune with God and His Angels; a reflection of the Uncreated Light; a mirror that can collect and concentrate upon itself all the moral splendors of the Universe. It is the soul alone that gives any value to the things of this world. and it is only by raising the soul to its just elevation above all other things, that we can look rightly upon the purposes of this earth. No sceptre nor throne, nor structure of ages, nor broad empire, can compare with the wonders and grandeurs of a single thought. That alone, of all things that have been made, comprehends the Maker of all. That alone is the key which unlocks all the treasures of the Universe; the power that reigns over Space, Time, and Eternity. That, under God, is the Sovereign Dispenser to man of all the blessings and glories that lie within the compass of possession, or the range of possibility. Virtue, Heaven, and Immortality exist not, nor ever will exist for us except as they exist and will exist, in the perception, feeling, and thought of the glorious mind. My Brother, in the hope that you have listened to and understood the Instruction and Lecture of this Degree, and that you feel the dignity of your own nature and the vast capacities of your own soul for good or evil, I proceed briefly to communicate to you the remaining instruction of this Degree. The Hebrew word, in the old Hebrew and Samaritan character, suspended in the East, over the five columns, is ADONAÏ, one of the names of God, usually translated Lord; and which theHebrews, in reading, always substitute for the True Name, which is for them ineffable. The five columns, in the five different orders of architecture, are emblematical to us of the five principal divisions of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite: 1. - The Tuscan, of the three blue Degrees, or the primitive Masonry. 2. - The Doric, of the ineffable Degrees, from the, fourth to the fourteenth, inclusive. 3. - The Ionic, of the fifteenth and sixteenth, or second temple Degrees. 4. - The Corinthian, of the seventeenth and eighteenth Degrees, or those of the new law. 5. - The Composite, of the philosophical and chivalric Degrees intermingled, from the nineteenth to the thirty-second, inclusive. The North Star, always fixed and immutable for us, represents the point in the centre of the circle, or the Deity in the centre of the Universe. It is the especial symbol of duty and of faith. To it, and the seven that continually revolve around it, mystical meanings are attached, which you will learn hereafter, if you should be permitted to advance, when you are made acquainted with the philosophical doctrines of the Hebrews. The Morning Star, rising in the East, Jupiter, called by the Hebrews Tsadõc or Tsydyk, Just, is an emblem to us of the ever approaching dawn of perfection and Masonic light. The three great lights of the Lodge are symbols to us of the Power, Wisdom, and Beneficence of the Deity. They are also symbols of the first three Sephiroth, or Emanations of the Deity, according to the Kabalah, Kether, the omnipotent divine will; Chochmah, the divine intellectual power to generate thought, and Binah, the divine intellectual capacity to produce it - the two latter, usually translated Wisdom and Understanding, being the active and the passive, the positive and the negative, which we do not yet endeavor to explain to you. They are the columns Jachin and Boaz, that stand at the entrance to the Masonic Temple. In another aspect of this Degree, the Chief of the Architects [ , Rab Banaim,] symbolizes the constitutional executive head and chief of a free government; and the Degree teaches us that no free government can long endure, when the people ceaseto select for their magistrates the best and the wisest of their statesmen; when, passing these by, they permit factions or sordid interests to select for them the small, the low, the ignoble, and the obscure, and into such hands commit the country's destinies. There is, after all, a "divine right" to govern; and it is vested in the ablest, wisest, best, of every nation. "Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding: I am power: by me kings do reign, and princes decree justice; by me princes rule, and nobles, even all the magistrates of the earth." For the present, my Brother, let this suffice. We welcome you among us, to this peaceful retreat of virtue, to a participation in our privileges, to a share in our joys and our sorrows.
XIII. ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. WHETHER the legend and history of this Degree are historically true, or but an allegory, containing in itself a deeper truth and a profounder meaning, we shall not now debate. If it be but a legendary myth, you must find out for yourself what it means. It is certain that the word which the Hebrews are not now permitted to pronounce was in common use by Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Laban, Rebecca, and even among tribes foreign to the Hebrews, before the time of Moses; and that it recurs a hundred times in the lyrical effusions of David and other Hebrew poets. We know that for many centuries the Hebrews have been forbidden to pronounce the Sacred Name; that wherever it occurs, they have for ages read the word Adonaï instead; and that under it, when the masoretic points, which represent the vowels, came to be used, they placed those which belonged to the latter word. The possession of the true pronunciation was deemed to confer on him who had it extraordinary and supernatural powers; and the Word itself, worn upon the person, was regarded as an amulet, a protection against personal danger, sickness, and evil spirits. We know that all this was a vain superstition, natural to a rude people, necessarily disappearing as the intellect of man became enlightened; and wholly unworthy of a Mason. It is noticeable that this notion of the sanctity of the Divine Name or Creative Word was common to all the ancient nations. The Sacred Word HOM was supposed by the ancient Persians (who were among the earliest emigrants from Northern India) tobe pregnant with a mysterious power; and they taught that by its utterance the world was created. In India it was forbidden to pronounce the word AUM or OM, the Sacred Name of the One Deity, manifested as Brahma, Vishna, and Seeva. These superstitious notions in regard to the efficacy of the Word, and the prohibition against pronouncing it, could, being errors, have formed no part of the pure primitive religion, or of the esoteric doctrine taught by Moses, and the full knowledge of which was confined to the Initiates; unless the whole was but an ingenious invention for the concealment of some other Name or truth, the interpretation and meaning whereof was made known only to the select few. If so, the common notions in regard to the Word grew up in the minds of the people, like other errors and fables among all the ancient nations, out of original truths and symbols and allegories misunderstood. So it has always been that allegories, intended as vehicles of truth, to be understood by the sages, have become or bred errors, by being literally accepted. It is true, that before the masoretic points were invented (which was after the beginning of the Christian era), the pronunciation of a word in the Hebrew language could not be known from the characters in which it was written. It was, therefore, possible for that of the name of the Deity to have been forgotten and lost. It is certain that its true pronunciation is not that represented by the word Jehovah; and therefore that that is not the true name of Deity, nor the Ineffable Word. The ancient symbols and allegories always had more than one interpretation. They always had a double meaning, and sometimes more than two, one serving as the envelope of the other. Thus the pronunciation of the word was a symbol; and that pronunciation and the word itself were lost, when the knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God faded out of the minds of the Jewish people. That is one interpretation - true, but not the inner and profoundest one. Men were figuratively said to forget the name of God, when they lost that knowledge, and worshipped the heathen deities, and burned incense to them on the high places, and passed their children through the fire to Moloch. Thus the attempts of the ancient Israelites and of the Initiates to ascertain the True Name of the Deity, and its pronunciation, and the loss of the True Word, are an allegory, in which arerepresented the general ignorance of the true nature and attributes of God, the proneness of the people of Judah and Israel to worship other deities, and the low and erroneous and dishonoring notions of the Grand Architect of the Universe, which all shared except a few favored persons; for even Solomon built altars and sacrificed to Astarat, the goddess of the Tsidumm, and Malcüm, the Aamünite god, and built high places for Kamüs, the Moabite deity, and Malec the god of the Beni-Aamün. The true nature of God was unknown to them, like His name; and they worshipped the calves of Jeroboam, as in the desert they did that made for them by Aarün. The mass of the Hebrews did not believe in the existence of one only God until a late period in their history. Their. early and popular ideas of the Deity were singularly low and unworthy. Even while Moses was receiving the law upon Mount Sinai, they forced Aarün to make them an image of the Egyptian god Apis, and fell down and adored it. They were ever ready to return to the worship of the gods of the Mitzraim; and soon after the death of Joshua they became devout worshippers of the false gods of all the surrounding nations. "Ye have borne," Amos, the prophet, said to them, speaking of their forty years' journeying in the desert, under Moses, "the tabernacle of your Malec and Kaiün your idols, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves." Among them, as among other nations, the conceptions of God formed by individuals varied according to their intellectual and spiritual capacities; poor and imperfect, and investing God with the commonest and coarest attributes of humanity, among the ignorant and coarse; pure and lofty among the virtuous and richly gifted. These conceptions gradually improved and became purified and ennobled, as the nation advanced in civilization - being lowest in the historical books, amended in the prophetic writings, and reaching their highest elevation among the poets. Among all the ancient nations there was one faith and one idea of Deity for the enlightened, intelligent, and educated, and another for the common people. To this rule the Hebrews were no exception. Yehovah, to the mass of the people, was like the gods of the nations around them, except that he was the peculiar God, first of the family of Abraham, of that of Isaac, and of that of Jacob, and afterward the National God; and, as they believed, more powerful than the other gods of the same nature worshippedby their neighbors - "Who among the Baalim is like unto thee, O Yehovah?" - expressed their whole creed. The Deity of the early Hebrews talked to Adam and Eve in the garden of delight, as he walked in it in the cool of the day; he conversed with Kayin; he sat and ate with Abraham in his tent; that patriarch required a visible token, before he would believe in his positive promise; he permitted Abraham to expostulate with him, and to induce him to change his first determination in regard to Sodom; he wrestled with Jacob; he showed Moses his person, though not his face; he dictated the minutest police regulations and the dimensions of the tabernacle and its furniture, to the Israelites; he insisted on and delighted in sacrifices and burnt-offerings; he was angry, jealous, and revengeful, as well as wavering and irresolute; he allowed Moses to reason him out of his fixed resolution utterly to destroy his people; he commanded the performance of the most shocking and hideous acts of cruelty and barbarity. He hardened the heart of Pharaoh; he repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto the people of Nineveh; and he did it not, to the disgust and anger of Jonah. Such were the popular notions of the Deity; and either the priests had none better, or took little trouble to correct these notions; or the popular intellect was not enough enlarged to enable them to entertain any higher conceptions of the Almighty. But such were not the ideas of the intellectual and enlightened few among the Hebrews. It is certain that they possessed a knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God; as the same class of men did among the other nations - Zoroaster, Menu, Confucius, Socrates, and Plato. But their doctrines on this subject were esoteric; they did not communicate them to the people at large, but only to a favored few; and as they were communicated in Egypt and India, in Persia and Phoenicia, in Greece and Samothrace, in the greater mysteries, to the Initiates. The communication of this knowledge and other secrets, some of which are perhaps lost, constituted, under other names, what we now call Masonry, or Free or Frank-Masonry. That knowledge was, in one sense, the Lost Word, which was made known to the Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Masons. It would be folly to pretend that the forms of Masonry were the same in those ages as they are now. The present name of the Order, and its titles, and the names of the Degrees now in use, were not then known.Even Blue Masonry cannot trace back its authentic history, with its present Degrees, further than the year 1700, if so far. But, by whatever name it was known in this or the other country, Masonry existed as it now exists, the same in spirit and at heart, not only when Solomon builded the temple, but centuries before - before even the first colonies emigrated into Southern India, Persia, and Egypt, from the cradle of the human race. The Supreme, Self-existent, Eternal, All-wise, All-powerful, Infinitely Good, Pitying, Beneficent, and Merciful Creator and Preserver of the Universe was the same, by whatever name he was called, to the intellectual and enlightened men of all nations. The name was nothing, if not a symbol and representative hieroglyph of his nature and attributes. The name AL represented his remoteness above men, his inaccessibility; BAL and BALA, his might; ALOHIM, his various potencies; IHUH, existence and the generation of things. None of his names, among the Orientals, were the symbols of a divinely infinite love and tenderness, and all-embracing mercy. As MOLOCH or MALEK he was but an omnipotent monarch, a tremendous and irresponsible Will; as ADONAÏ, only an arbitrary LORD and Master; as AL Shadaï, potent and a DESTROYER. To communicate true and correct ideas in respect of the Deity was one chief object of the mysteries. In them, Khürüm the King, and Khürüm the Master, obtained their knowledge of him and his attributes; and in them that knowledge was taught to Moses and Pythagoras. Wherefore nothing forbids you to consider the whole legend of this Degree, like that of the Master's, an allegory, representing the perpetuation of the knowledge of the True God in the sanctuaries of initiation. By the subterranean vaults you may understand the places of initiation, which in the ancient ceremonies were generally under ground. The Temple of Solomon presented a symbolic image of the Universe; and resembled, in its arrangements and furniture, all the temples of the ancient nations that practised the mysteries. The system of numbers was intimately connected with their religions and worship, and has come down to us in Masonry; though the esoteric meaning with which the numbers used by us are pregnant is unknown to the vast majority of those who use them. Those numbers were especially employed that had a reference to the Deity, represented his attributes, or figured in theframe-work of the world, in time and space, and formed more or less the bases of that frame-work. These were universally regarded as sacred, being the expression of order and intelligence, the utterances of Divinity Himself. The Holy of Holies of the Temple formed a cube; in which, drawn on a plane surface, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 lines visible, and three sides or faces. It corresponded with the number four, by which the ancients presented Nature, it being the number of substances or corporeal forms, and of the elements, the cardinal points and seasons, and the secondary colors. The number three everywhere represented the Supreme Being. Hence the name of the Deity, engraven upon the triangular plate, and that sunken into the cube of agate, taught the ancient Mason, and teaches us, that the true knowledge of God, of His nature and His attributes is written by Him upon the leaves of the great Book of Universal Nature, and may be read there by all who are endowed with the requisite amount of intellect and intelligence. This knowledge of God, so written there, and of which Masonry has in all ages been the interpreter, is the Master Mason's Word. Within the Temple, all the arrangements were mystically and symbolically connected with the same system. The vault or ceiling, starred like the firmament, was supported by twelve columns, representing the twelve months of the year. The border that ran around the columns represented the zodiac, and one of the twelve celestial signs was appropriated to each column. The brazen sea was supported by twelve oxen, three looking to each cardinal point of the compass. And so in our day every Masonic Lodge represents the Universe. Each extends, we are told, from the rising to the setting sun, from the South to the North, from the surface of the Earth to the Heavens, and from the same to the centre of the globe. In it are represented the sun, moon, and stars; three great torches in the East, West, and South, forming a triangle, give it light: and, like the Delta or Triangle suspended in the East, and inclosing the Ineffable Name, indicate, by the mathematical equality of the angles and sides, the beautiful and harmonious proportions which govern in the aggregate and details of the Universe; while those sides and angles represent, by their number, three, the Trinity of Power, Wisdom, and Harmony, which presided at the building of this marvellous work These three great lights also represent thegreat mystery of the three principles, of creation, dissolution or destruction, and reproduction or regeneration, consecrated by all creeds in their numerous Trinities. The luminous pedestal, lighted by the perpetual flame within, is a symbol of that light of Reason, given by God to man, by which he is enabled to read in the Book of Nature the record of the thought, the revelation of the attributes of the Deity. The three Masters, Adoniram, Joabert, and Stolkin, are types of the True Mason, who seeks for knowledge from pure motives, and that he may be the better enabled to serve and benefit his fellow-men; while the discontented and presumptuous Masters who were buried in the ruins of the arches represent those who strive to acquire it for unholy purposes, to gain power over their fellows, to gratify their pride, their vanity, or their ambition. The Lion that guarded the Ark and held in his mouth the key wherewith to open it, figuratively represents Solomon, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who preserved and communicated the key to the true knowledge of God, of His laws, and of the profound mysteries of the moral and physical Universe. ENOCH [ Khanõc], we are told, walked with God three hundred years, after reaching the age of sixty-five - "walked with God, and he was no more, for God had taken him." His name signified in the Hebrew, INITIATE or INITIATOR. The legend of the columns, of granite and brass or bronze, erected by him, is probably symbolical. That of bronze, which survived the flood, is supposed to symbolize the mysteries, of which Masonry is the legitimate successor - from the earliest times the custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths, unknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems, and allegories. The legend of this Degree is thus, partially, interpreted. It is of little importance whether it is in anywise historical. For its value consists in the lessons which it inculcates, and the duties which it prescribes to those who receive it. The parables and allegories of the Scriptures are not less valuable than history. Nay, they are more so, because ancient history is little instructive, and truths are concealed in and symbolized by the legend and the myth. There are profounder meanings concealed in the symbols of this Degree, connected with the philosophical system of the HebrewKabalists, which you will learn hereafter, if you should be so fortunate as to advance. They are unfolded in the higher Degrees. The lion [ Arai, Araiah, which also means the altar] still holds in his mouth the key of the enigma of the sphynx. But there is one application of this Degree, that you are now entitled to know; and which, remembering that Khürüm, the Master, is the symbol of human freedom, you would probably discover for yourself. It is not enough for a people to gain its liberty. It must secure it. It must not intrust it to the keeping, or hold it at the pleasure, of any one man. The keystone of the Royal Arch of the great Temple of Liberty is a fundamental law, charter, or constitution; the expression of the fixed habits of thought of the people, embodied in a written instrument, or the result of the slow accretions and the consolidation of centuries; the same in war as in peace; that cannot be hastily changed, nor be violated with impunity, but is sacred, like the Ark of the Covenant of God, which none could touch and live. A permanent constitution, rooted in the affections, expressing the will and judgment, and built upon the instincts and settled habits of thought of the people, with an independent judiciary, an elective legislature of two branches, an executive responsible to the people, and the right of trial by jury, will guarantee the liberties of a people, if it be virtuous and temperate, without luxury, and without the lust of conquest and dominion, and the follies of visionary theories of impossible perfection. Masonry teaches its Initiates that the pursuits and occupations of this life, its activity, care, and ingenuity, the predestined developments of the nature given us by God, tend to promote His great design, in making the world; and are not at war with the great purpose of life. It teaches that everything is beautiful in its time, in its place, in its appointed office; that everything which man is put to do, if rightly and faithfully done, naturally helps to work out his salvation; that if he obeys the genuine principles of his calling, he will be a good man: and that it is only by neglect and nonperformance of the task set for him by Heaven, by wandering into idle dissipation, or by violating their beneficent and lofty spirit, that he becomes a bad man. The appointed action of life is the great training of Providence; and if man yields himselfto it, he will need neither churches nor ordinances, except for the expression of his religious homage and gratitude. For there is a religion of toil. It is not all drudgery, a mere stretching of the limbs and straining of the sinews to tasks. It has a meaning and an intent. A living heart pours life-blood into the toiling arm; and warm affections inspire and mingle with man's labors. They are the home affections. Labor toils a-field, or plies its task in cities, or urges the keels of commerce over wide oceans; but home is its centre; and thither it ever goes with its earnings, with the means of support and comfort for others; offerings sacred to the thought of every true man, as a sacrifice at a golden shrine. Many faults there are amidst the toils of life; many harsh and hasty words are uttered; but still the toils go on, weary and hard and exasperating as they often are. For in that home is age or sickness, or helpless infancy, or gentle childhood, or feeble woman, that must not want. If man had no other than mere selfish impulses, the scene of labor which we behold around us would not exist. The advocate who fairly and honestly presents his case, with feeling of true self-respect, honor, and conscience, to help the tribunal on towards the right conclusion, with a conviction that God's justice reigns there, is acting a religious part, leading that day religious life; or else right and justice are no part of religion Whether, during all that day, he has once appealed, in form or in terms, to his conscience, or not; whether he has once spoken of religion and God, or not; if there has been the inward purpose, the conscious intent and desire, that sacred justice should triumph, he has that day led a good and religious life, and made most a essential contribution to that religion of life and of society, the cause of equity between man and man, and of truth and right action in the world. Books, to be of religious tendency in the Masonic sense, need not be books of sermons, of pious exercises, or of prayers. Whatever inculcates pure, noble, and patriotic sentiments, or touches the heart with the beauty of virtue, and the excellence of an upright life, accords with the religion of Masonry, and is the Gospel of literature and art. That Gospel is preached from many a book and painting, from many a poem and fiction, and review and newspaper; and it is a painful error and miserable narrowness, not to recognize these wide-spread agencies of Heaven's providing; notto see and welcome these many-handed coadjutors, to the great and good cause. The oracles of God do not speak from the pulpit alone. There is also a religion of society. In business, there is much more than sale, exchange, price, payment; for there is the sacred faith of man in man. When we repose perfect confidence in the integrity of another; when we feel that he will not swerve from the right, frank, straightforward, conscientious course, for any temptation; his integrity and conscientiousness are the image of God to us; and when we believe in it, it is as great and generous an act, as when we believe in the rectitude of the Deity. In gay assemblies for amusement, the good affections of life gush and mingle. If they did not, these gathering-places would be as dreary and repulsive as the caves and dens of outlaws and robbers. When friends meet, and hands are warmly pressed, and the eye kindles and the countenance is suffused with gladness, there is a religion between their hearts; and each loves and worships the True and Good that is in the other. It is not policy, or self-interest, or selfishness that spreads such a charm around that meeting, but the halo of bright and beautiful affection. The same splendor of kindly liking, and affectionate regard, shines like the soft overarching sky, over all the world; over all places where men meet, and walk or toil together; not over lovers' bowers and marriage-altars alone, not over the homes of purity and tenderness alone; but over all tilled fields, and busy workshops, and dusty highways, and paved streets. There is not a worn stone upon the sidewalks, but has been the altar of such offerings of mutual kindness; nor a wooden pillar or iron railing against which hearts beating with affection have not leaned. How many soever other elements there are in the stream of life flowing through these channels, that is surely here and everywhere; honest, heartfelt, disinterested, inexpressible affection. Every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion; and its teachings are instruction in religion. For here are inculcated disinterestedness, affection, toleration, devotedness, patriotism, truth, a generous sympathy with those who suffer and mourn, pity for the fallen, mercy for the erring, relief for those in want, Faith, Hope, and Charity. Here we meet as brethren, to learn to know and love each other. Here we greet each other gladly, are lenient to each other's faults, regardful of each other's feelings, ready to relieveeach other's wants. This is the true religion revealed to the ancient patriarchs; which Masonry has taught for many centuries, and which it will continue to teach as long as time endures. If unworthy passions, or selfish, bitter, or revengeful feelings, contempt, dislike, hatred, enter here, they are intruders and n t welcome, strangers uninvited, and not guests. Certainly there are many evils and bad passions, and much hate and contempt and unkindness everywhere in the world. We cannot refuse to see the evil -that is in life. But all is not evil. We still see God in the world. There is good amidst the evil. The hand of mercy leads wealth to the hovels of poverty and sorrow. Truth and simplicity live amid many wiles and sophistries. There are good hearts underneath gay robes, and under tattered garments also. Love clasps the hand of love, amid all the envyings and distractions of showy competition; fidelity, pity, and sympathy hold the long night-watch by the bedside of the suffering neighbor, amidst the surrounding poverty and squalid misery. Devoted men go from city to city to nurse those smitten down by the terrible pestilence that renews at intervals its mysterious marches. Women well-born and delicately nurtured nursed the wounded soldiers in hospitals, before it became fashionable to do so; and even poor lost women, whom God alone loves and pities, tend the plaguestricken with a patient and generous heroism. Masonry and its kindred Orders teach men to love each other, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the sick, and bury the friendless dead. Everywhere God finds and blesses the kindly office, the pitying thought, and the loving heart. There is an element of good in all men's lawful pursuits and a divine spirit breathing in all their lawful affections. The ground on which they tread is holy ground. There is a natural religion of life, answering, with however many a broken tone, to the religion of nature. There is a beauty and glory in Humanity., in man, answering, with however many a mingling shade, to the loveliness of soft landscapes and swelling hills, and the wondrous Men may be virtuous, self-improving, and religious in their employments. Precisely for that, those employments were made. All their social relations, friendship, love , the ties of family, were made to be holy. They may be religious, not by a kind of protestand resistance against their several vocations; but by conformity to their true spirit. Those vocations do not exclude religion; but demand it, for their own perfection. They may be religious laborers, whether in field or factory; religious physicians, lawyers, sculptors, poets, painters, and musicians. They may be religious in all the toils and in all the amusements of life. Their life may be a religion; the broad earth its altar; its incense the very breath of life; its fires ever kindled by the brightness of Heaven. Bound up with our poor, frail life, is the mighty thought that spurns the narrow span of all visible existence. Ever the soul reaches outward, and asks for freedom. It looks forth from the narrow and grated windows of sense, upon the wide immeasurable creation; it knows that around it and beyond it lie outstretched the infinite and everlasting paths. Everything within us and without us ought to stir our minds to admiration and wonder. We are a mystery encompassed with mysteries. The connection of mind with matter is a mystery; the wonderful telegraphic communication between the brain and every part of the body, the power and action of the will. Every familiar step is more than a story in a land of enchantment. The power of movement is as mysterious as the power of thought. Memory, and dreams that are the indistinct echoes of dead memories are alike inexplicable. Universal harmony springs from infinite complication. The momentum of every step we take in our dwelling contributes in part to the order of the Universe. We are connected by ties of thought, and even of matter and its forces, with the whole boundless Universe and all the past and coming generations of men. The humblest object beneath our eye as completely defies our scrutiny as the economy of the most distant star. Every leaf and every blade of grass holds within itself secrets which no human penetration will ever fathom. No man can tell what is its principle of life. No man can know what his power of secretion is. Both are inscrutable mysteries. Wherever we place our hand we lay it upon the locked bosom of mystery. Step where we will, we tread upon wonders. The sea-sands, the clods of the field, the water-worn pebbles on the hills, the rude masses of rock, are traced over and over, in every direction, with a handwriting older and more significant and sublime than all the ancient ruins, and all the overthrown and buried cities that past generationshave left upon the earth; for it is the handwriting of the Almighty. A Mason's great business with life is to read the book of its teaching; to find that life is not the doing of drudgeries, but the hearing of oracles. The old mythology is but a leaf in that book; for it peopled the world with spiritual natures; and science, many-leaved, still spreads before us the same tale of wonder. We shall be just as happy hereafter, as we are pure and upright, and no more, just as happy as our character prepares us to be, and no more. Our moral, like our mental character, is nut formed in a moment; it is the habit of our minds; the result of many thoughts and feelings and efforts, bound together by many natural and strong ties. The great law of Retribution is, that all coming experience is to be affected by every present feeling; every future moment of being must answer for every present moment; one moment, sacrificed to vice, or lost to improvement, is forever sacrificed and lost; an hour's delay to enter the right path, is to put us back so far, in the everlasting pursuit of happiness; and every sin, even of the best men, is to be thus answered for, if not according to the full measure of its illdesert, yet according to a rule of unbending rectitude and impartiality. The law of retribution presses upon every m an, whether he thinks of it or not. It pursues him through all the courses of life, with a step that never falters nor tires, and with an eye that never sleeps. If it were not so, God's government would not be impartial; 'there would be no discrimination; no moral dominion; no light shed upon the mysteries of Providence. Whatsoever a man soweth, that, and not something else, shall he reap. That which we are doing, good or evil, grave or gay, that which we do today and shall do to-morrow; each thought, each feeling, each action, each event; every passing hour, every breathing moment; all are contributing to form the character according to which we are to be judged. Every particle of influence that goes to form that aggregate, - our character, - will, in that future scrutiny, be sifted out from the mass; and, particle by particle, with ages perhaps intervening, fall a distinct contribution to the sum of our joys or woes. Thus every idle word and idle hour will give answer in the judgment. Let us take care, therefore, what we sow. An evil temptation comes upon us; the opportunity of unrighteous gain, or of unhallowedindulgence, either in the sphere of business or pleasure, of society or solitude. We yield; and plant a seed of bitterness and sorrow. To-morrow it will threaten discovery. Agitated and alarmed, we cover the sin, and bury it deep in falsehood and hypocrisy. In the bosom where it lies concealed, in the fertile soil of kindred vices, that sin dies not, but thrives and grows; and other and still other germs of evil gather around the accursed root; until, from that single seed of corruption, there springs up in the soul all that is horrible in habitual lying, knavery, or vice. Loathingly, often, we take each downward step; but a frightful power urges us onward; and the hell of debt, disease, ignominy, or remorse gathers its shadows around Our steps even on earth; and are yet but the beginnings of sorrows. The evil deed may be done in a single moment; but conscience never dies, memory never sleeps; guilt never can become innocence; and remorse can never whisper peace. Beware, thou who art tempted to evil! Beware what thou layest up for the future! Beware what thou layest up in the archives of eternity! Wrong not thy neighbor! lest the thought of him thou injurest, and who suffers by thy act, be to thee a pang which years will not deprive of its bitterness! Break not into the house of innocence, to rifle it of its treasure; lest when many years have passed over thee, the moan of its distress may not have died away from thine ear! Build not the desolate throne of ambition in thy heart; nor be busy with devices, and circumventings, and selfish schemings; lest desolation and loneliness be on thy path, as it stretches into the long futurity! Live not a useless, an impious, or an injurious life! for bound up with that life is the immutable principle of an endless retribution, and elements of God's creating, which will never spend their force, but continue ever to unfold with the ages of eternity. Be not deceived! God has formed thy nature, thus to answer to the future. His law can never be abrogated, nor His justice eluded; and forever and ever it will be true, that "Whatsoever a man soweth, that also he shall reap.” XIV. GRAND ELECT, PERFECT, AND SUBLIMEMASON.[Perfect Elu.] It is for each individual Mason to discover the secret of Ma-sonry, by reflection upon its symbols and a wise consideration andanalysis of what is said and done in the work. Masonry does notinculcate her truths. She states them, once and briefly; or hintsthem, perhaps, darkly; or interposes a cloud between them andeyes that would be dazzled by them. "Seek, and ye shall find,"knowledge and the truth.The practical object of Masonry is the physical and moralamelioration and the intellectual and spiritual improvement ofindividuals and society. Neither can be effected, except by thedissemination of truth. It is falsehood in doctrines and fallacyin principles, to which most of the miseries of men and the mis-fortunes of nations are owing. Public opinion is rarely right onany point; and there are and always will be important truths tobe substituted in that opinion in the place of many errors andabsurd and injurious prejudices. There are few truths that publicopinion has not at some time hated and persecuted as heresies;and few errors that have not at some time seemed to it truths radi-ant from the immediate presence of God. There are moral mala-dies, also, of man and society, the treatment of which requires notonly boldness, but also, and more, prudence and discretion; sincethey are more the fruit of false and pernicious doctrines, moral,political, and religious, than of vicious inclinations.Much of the Masonic secret manifests itself, without speechrevealing it to him who even partially comprehends all the De-grees in proportion as he receives them; and particularly to thosewho advance to the highest Degrees of the Ancient and AcceptedScottish Rite. That Rite raises a corner of the veil, even in theDegree of Apprentice; for it there declares that Masonry is aworship.Masonry labors to improve the social order by enlighteningmen's minds, warming their hearts with the love of the good, in-spiring them with the great principle of human fraternity, andrequiring of its disciples that their language and actions shall con-form to that principle, that they shall enlighten each other, con-trol their passions, abhor vice, and pity the vicious man as oneafflicted with a deplorable malady.It is the universal, eternal, immutable religion, such as Godplanted it in the heart of universal humanity. No creed has everbeen long-lived that was not built on this foundation. It is thebase, and they are the superstructure. "Pure religion and unde-filed before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless andwidows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from theworld." "Is not this the fast that I have chosen ? to loose thebands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let theoppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke ?" The ministersof this religion are all Masons who comprehend it and are devotedto it; its sacrifices to God are good works, the sacrifices of thebase and disorderly passions, the offering up of self-interest onthe altar of humanity, and perpetual efforts to attain to all themoral perfection of which man is capable.To make honor and duty the steady beacon-lights that shallguide your life-vessel over the stormy seas of time; to do thatwhich it is right to do, not because it will insure you success, orbring with it a reward, or gain the applause of men, or be "thebest policy," more prudent or more advisable; but because it isright, and therefore ought to be done; to war incessantly againsterror, intolerance, ignorance, and vice, and yet to pity those whoerr, to be tolerant even of intolerance, to teach the ignorant, andto labor to reclaim the vicious, are some of the duties of a Mason.A good Mason is one that can look upon death, and see its facewith the same countenance with which he hears its story; thatcan endure all the labors of his life with his soul supporting hisbody, that can equally despise riches when he hath them andwhen he hath them not;that is, not sadder if they are in his neigh-bor's exchequer, nor more lifted up if they shine around about hisown walls; one that is not moved with good fortune coming tohim, nor going from him; that can look upon another man's landswith equanimity and pleasure, as if they were his own; and yetlook upon his own, and use them too, just as if they were anotherman's; that neither spends his goods prodigally and foolishly, noryet keeps them avariciously and like a miser; that weighs notbenefits by weight and number, but by the mind and circumstancesof him who confers them; that never thinks his charity expen-sive, if a worthy person be the receiver; that does nothing foropinion's sake, but everything for conscience, being as careful ofhis thoughts as of his acting in markets and theatres, and in asmuch awe of himself as of a whole assembly; that is, bountifuland cheerful to his friends, and charitable and apt to forgive hisenemies; that loves his country, consults its honor, and obeys itslaws, and desires and endeavors nothing more than that he maydo his duty and honor God. And such a Mason may reckon hislife to be the life of a man, and compute his months, not bythe course of the sun, but by the zodiac and circle of his vir-tues.The whole world is but one republic, of which each nation is afamily, and every individual a child. Masonry, not in anywisederogating from the differing duties which the diversity of statesrequires, tends to create a new people, which, composed of men ofmany nations and tongues, shall all be bound together by thebonds of science, morality, and virtue.Essentially philanthropic, philosophical, and progressive, it hasfor the basis of its dogma a firm belief in the existence of Godand his providence, and of the immortality of the soul; for itsobject, the dissemination of moral, political, philosophical, andreligious truth, and the practice of all the virtues. In every age,its device has been, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," with constitu-tional government, law, order, discipline, and subordination tolegitimate authority--government and not anarchy.But it is neither a political party nor a religious sect. Itbraces all parties and all sects, to form from among them all a vastfraternal association. It recognizes the dignity of human nature,and man's right to such freedom as he is fitted for; and itknows nothing that should place one man below another, exceptignorance, debasement, and crime, and the necessity of subordina-tion to lawful will and authority.It is philanthropic; for it recognizes the great truth that allmen are of the same origin, have common interests, and shouldco-operate together to the same end.Therefore it teaches its members to love one another, to give toeach other mutual assistance and support in all the circumstancesof life, to share each other's pains and sorrows, as well as theirjoys and pleasures; to guard the reputations, respect the opinions,and be perfectly tolerant of the errors, of each other, in mattersof faith and beliefs.It is philisophical because it teaches the great Truths concern-ing the nature and existence of one Supreme Deity, and the exist-ence and immortality of the soul. It revives the Academy ofPlato and the wise teachings of Socrates. It reiterates the max-ims of Pythagoras, Confucius, and Zoroaster, and reverentiallyenforces the sublime lessons of Him who died upon the Cross.The ancients thought that universal humanity acted under theinfluence of two opposing Principles, the Good and the Evil: ofwhich the Good urged men toward Truth, Independence, and De-votedness and the Evil toward Falsehood, Servility, and Selfish-ness. Masonry represents the Good Principle and constantly warsagainst the evil one. It is the Hercules, the Osiris, the Apollo, theMithras, and the Ormuzd, at everlasting and deadly feud withthe demons of ignorance, brutality, baseness, falsehood, slavish-ness of soul, intolerance, superstition, tyranny, meanness, the in-solence of wealth, and bigotry.When despotism and superstition, twin-powers of evil and dark-ness, reigned everywhere and seemed invincible and immortal, itinvented, to avoid persecution, the mysteries, that is to say, theallegory, the symbol, and the emblem, and transmitted its doc-trines by the secret mode of initiation. Now, retaining its ancientsymbols, and in part its ancient ceremonies, it displays in everycivilized country its banner, on which in letters of living light itsgreat principles are written; and it smiles at the puny efforts ofkings and popes to crush it out by excommunication and inter-diction.Man's views in regard to God, will contain only so much posi-tive truth as the human mind is capable of receiving; whetherthat truth is attained by the exercise of reason, or communicatedby revelation. It must necessarily be both limited and alloyed, tobring it within the competence of finite human intelligence. Be-ing finite, we can form no correct or adequate idea of the Infinite;being material, we can form no clear conception of the Spiritual.We do believe in and know the infinity of Space and Time, andthe spirituality of the Soul; but the idea of that infinity andspirituality eludes us. Even Omnipotence cannot infuse infiniteconceptions into finite minds; nor can God, without first entirelychanging the conditions of our being, pour a complete and fullknowledge of His own nature and attributes into the narrowcapacity of a human soul. Human intelligence could not graspit, nor human language express it. The visible is, necessarily, themeasure of the invisible.The consciousness of the individual reveals itself alone. Hisknowledge cannot pass beyond the limits of his own being. Hisconceptions of other things and other beings are only his concep-tions. They are not those things or beings themselves. The livingprinciple of a living Universe must be INFINITE; while all ourideas and conceptions are finite, and applicable only to finite beings.The Deity is thus not an object of knowledge, but of faith; notto be approached by the understanding, but by the moral sense;not to be conceived, but to be felt. All attempts to embrace theInfinite in the conception of the Finite are, and must be only ac-commodations to the frailty of man. Shrouded from human com-prehension in an obscurity from which a chastened imagination isawed back, and Thought retreats in conscious weakness, theDivine Nature is a theme on which man is little entitled to dog-matize. Here the philosophic Intellect becomes most painfullyaware of its own insufficiency.And yet it is here that man most dogmatizes, classifies and de-scribes God's attributes, makes out his map of God's nature, andhis inventory of God's qualities, feelings, impulses, and passions;and then hangs and burns his brother, who, as dogmatically as he,makes out a different map and inventory. The common under-standing has no humility. Its God is an incarnate Divinity. Im-perfection imposes its own limitations on the Illimitable, andclothes the Inconceivable Spirit of the Universe in forms thatcome within the grasp of the senses and the intellect, and arederived from that infinite and imperfect nature which is but God'screation.We are all of us, though not all equally, mistaken. The cher-ished dogmas of each of us are not, as we fondly suppose, the puretruth of God; but simply our own special form of error, ourguesses at truth, the refracted and fragmentary rays of light thathave fallen upon our own minds. Our little systems have theirday, and cease to be; they are but broken lights of God; and Heis more than they. Perfect truth is not attainable anywhere. Westyle this Degree that of Perfection; and yet what it teaches isimperfect and defective. Yet we are not to relax in the pursuitof truth, nor contentedly acquiesce in error. It is our duty alwaysto press forward in the search; for though absolute truth is unat-tainable, yet the amount of error in our views is capable of pro-gressive and perpetual diminution; and thus Masonry is a con-tinual struggle toward the light.All errors are not equally innocuous. That which is most in-jurious is to entertain unworthy conceptions of the nature andattributes of God; and it is this that Masonry symbolizes by igno-rance of the True Word. The true word of a Mason is, not theentire, perfect, absolute truth in regard to God; but the highestand noblest conception of Him that our minds are capable offorming; and this word is Ineffable, because one man cannotcommunicate to another his own conception of Deity; since everyman's conception of God must be proportioned to his mental cul-tivation and intellectual powers, and moral excellence. God is, asman conceives Him, the reflected image of man himself.For every man's conception of God must vary with his mentalcultivation and mental powers. If any one contents himself withany lower image than his intellect is capable of grasping, then hecontents himself with that which is false to him, as well as false infact. If lower than he can reach, he must needs feel it to be false.And if we, of the nineteenth century after Christ, adopt the con-ceptions of the nineteenth century before Him; if our conceptionsof God are those of the ignorant, narrow-minded, and vindictiveIsraelite; then we think worse of God, and have a lower, meaner,and more limited view of His nature, than the faculties which Hehas bestowed are capable of grasping. The highest view we canform is nearest to the truth. If we acquiesce in any lower one,we acquiesce in an untruth. We feel that it is an affront and anindignity to Him, to conceive of Him as cruel, short-sighted, ca-pricious, and unjust; as a jealous, an angry, a vindictive Being.When we examine our conceptions of His character, if we canconceive of a loftier, nobler, higher, more beneficent, glorious, andmagnificent character, then this latter is to us the true conceptionof Deity; for nothing can be imagined more excellent than He.Religion, to obtain currency and influence with the great massof mankind, must needs be alloyed with such an amount of erroras to place it far below the standard attainable by the higherhuman capacities. A religion as pure as the loftiest and most cul-tivated human reason could discern, would not be comprehendedby, or effective over, the less educated portion of mankind. Whatis Truth to the philosopher, would not be Truth, nor have theeffect of Truth, to the peasant. The religion of the many mustnecessarily be more incorrect than that of the refined and reflectivefew, not so much in its essence as in its forms, not so much in thespiritual idea which lies latent at the bottom of it, as in the sym-bols and dogmas in which that idea is embodied. The truestreligion would, in many points, not be comprehended by the igno-rant, nor consolatory to them, nor guiding and supporting forthem. The doctrines of the Bible are often not clothed in thelanguage of strict truth, but in that which was fittest to conveyto a rude and ignorant people the practical essentials of the doc-trine. A perfectly pure faith, free from all extraneous admixtures,a system of noble theism and lofty morality, would find too littlepreparation for it in the common mind and heart, to admit ofprompt reception by the masses of mankind; and Truth mightnot have reached us, if it had not borrowed the wings of Error.The Mason regards God as a Moral Governor, as well as anOriginal Creator; as a God at hand, and not merely one afar offin the distance of infinite space, and in the remoteness of Pastor Future Eternity. He conceives of Him as taking a watchfuland presiding interest in the affairs of the world, and as influenc-ing the hearts and actions of men.To him, God is the great Source of the World of Life and Mat-ter; and man, with his wonderful corporeal and mental frame,His direct work. He believes that God has made men with differ-ent intellectual capacities, and enabled some, by superior intellect-ual power, to see and originate truths which are hidden from themass of men. He believes that when it is His will that mankindshould make some great step forward, or achieve some pregnantdiscovery, He calls into being some intellect of more than ordi-nary magnitude and power, to give birth to new ideas, andgrander conceptions of the Truths vital to Humanity.We hold that God has so ordered matters in this beautiful andharmonious, but mysteriously-governed Universe, that one greatmind after another will arise, from time to time, as such areneeded, to reveal to men the truths that are wanted, and theamount of truth than can be borne. He so arranges, that natureand the course of events shall send men into the world, endowedwith that higher mental and moral organization, in which grandtruths, and sublime gleams of spiritual light will spontaneouslyand inevitably arise. These speak to men by inspiration.Whatever Hiram really was, he is the type, perhaps an imag-inary type, to us, of humanity in its highest phase; an exemplarof what man may and should become, in the course of ages, in hisprogress toward the realization of his destiny; an individual giftedwith a glorious intellect, a noble soul, a fine organization, and aperfectly balanced moral being; an earnest of what humanity maybe, and what we believe it will hereafter be in God's good time;the possibility of the race made real.The Mason believes that God has arranged this glorious but per-plexing world with a purpose, and on a plan. He holds that everyman sent upon this earth, and especially every man of superiorcapacity, has a duty to perform, a mission to fulfill, a baptism tobe baptized with; that every great and good man possesses someportion of God's truth, which he must proclaim to the world, andwhich must bear fruit in his own bosom. In a true and simplesense, he believes all the pure, wise, and intellectual to be inspired,and to be so for the instruction, advancement, and elevation ofmankind. That kind of inspiration, like God's omnipresence, isnot limited to the few writers claimed by Jews, Christians, orMoslems, but is co-extensive with the race. It is the consequenceof a faithful use of our faculties. Each man is its subject, God isits source, and Truth its only test. It differs in degrees, as theintellectual endowments, the moral wealth of the soul, and the de-gree of cultivation of those endowments and faculties differ. It islimited to no sect, age, or nation. It is wide as the world andcommon as God. It was not given to a few men, in the infancyof mankind, to monopolize inspiration, and bar God out of thesoul. We are not born in the dotage and decay of the world. Thestars are beautiful as in their prime; the most ancient Heavensare fresh and strong. God is still everywhere in nature. Wher-ever a heart beats with love, wherever Faith and Reason uttertheir oracles, there is God, as formerly in the hearts of seers andprophets. No soil on earth is so holy as the good man's heart;nothing is so full of God. This inspiration is not given to thelearned alone, not alone to the great and wise, but to every faithfulchild of God. Certain as the open eye drinks in the light, do thepure in heart see God; and he who lives truly, feels Him as a pres-ence within the soul. The conscience is the very voice of Deity.Masonry, around whose altars the Christian, the Hebrew, theMoslem, the Brahmin, the followers of Confucius and Zoroaster,can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer to the one God whois above all the Baalim, must needs leave it to each of its Initiatesto look for the foundation of his faith and hope to the writtenscriptures of his own religion. For itself it finds those truthsdefinite enough, which are written by the finger of God upon theheart of man and on the pages of the book of nature. Views ofreligion and duty, wrought out by the meditations of the studious,confirmed by the allegiance of the good and wise, stamped assterling by the response they find in every uncorrupted mind, com-mend themselves to Masons of every creed, and may well be ac-cepted by all.The Mason does not pretend to dogmatic certainty, nor vainlyimagine such certainty attainable. He considers that if therewere no written revelation, he could safely rest the hopes that ani-mate him and the principles that guide him, on the deductions ofreason and the convictions of instinct and consciousness. He canfind a sure foundation for his religious belief, in these deductionsof the intellect and convictions of the heart. For reason provesto him the existence and attributes of God; and those spiritualinstincts which he feels are the voice of God in his soul, infuseinto his mind a sense of his relation to God, a conviction of thebeneficence of his Creator and Preserver, and a hope of future ex-istence; and his reason and conscience alike unerringly point tovirtue as the highest good, and the destined aim and purpose ofman's life.He studies the wonders of the Heavens, the frame-work andrevolutions of the Earth, the mysterious beauties and adaptationsof animal existence, the moral and material constitution of thehuman creature, so fearfully and wonderfully made; and is satis-fied that God IS; and that a Wise and Good Being is the authorof the starry Heavens above him, and of the moral world withinhim; and his mind finds an adequate foundation for its hopes, itsworship, its principles of action, in the far-stretching Universe, inthe glorious firmament, in the deep, full soul, bursting with un-utterable thoughts.These are truths which every reflecting mind will unhesitatinglyreceive, as not to be surpassed, nor capable of improvement; andfitted, if obeyed, to make earth indeed a Paradise, and man only alittle lower than the angels. The worthlessness of ceremonialobservances, and the necessity of active virtue; the enforcementof purity of heart as the security for purity of life, and of thegovernment of the thoughts, as the originators and forerunners ofaction; universal philanthropy, requiring us to love all men, andto do unto others that and that only which we should think itright, just, and generous for them to do unto us; forgiveness ofinjuries; the necessity of self-sacrifice in the discharge of duty;humility; genuine sincerity, and being that which we seem to be;all these sublime precepts need no miracle, no voice from theclouds, to recommend them to our allegiance, or to assure us oftheir divine origin. They command obedience by virtue of theirinherent rectitude and beauty; and have been, and are, and willbe the law in every age and every country of the world. Godrevealed them to man in the beginning.To the Mason, God is our Father in Heaven, to be Whoseespecial children is the sufficient reward of the peacemakers, to seeWhose face the highest hope of the pure in heart; Who is ever athand to strengthen His true worshippers; to Whom our most fer-vent love is due, our most humble and patient submission; Whosemost acceptable worship is a pure and pitying heart and a benefi-cent life; in Whose constant presence we live and act, to Whosemerciful disposal we are resigned by that death which, we hopeand believe, is but the entrance to a better life; and Whose wisedecrees forbid a man to lap his soul in an elysium of mere indolentcontent.As to our feelings toward Him and our conduct toward man,Masonry teaches little about which men can differ, and little fromwhich they can dissent. He is our Father; and we are all breth-ren. This much lies open to the most ignorant and busy, as fullyas to those who have most leisure and are most learned. Thisneeds no Priest to teach it, and no authority to indorse it; and ifevery man did that only which is consistent with it, it would exilebarbarity, cruelty, intolerance, uncharitableness, perfidy, treach-ery, revenge, selfishness, and all their kindred vices and bad pas-sions beyond the confines of the world.The true Mason, sincerely holding that a Supreme God createdand governs this world, believes also that He governs it by laws,which, though wise, just, and beneficent, are yet steady, unwaver-ing, inexorable. He believes that his agonies and sorrows are or-dained for his chastening, his strengthening, his elaboration anddevelopment; because they are the necessary results of the opera-tion of laws, the best that could be devised for the happiness andpurification of the species, and to give occasion and opportunityfor the practice of all the virtues, from the homeliest and mostcommon, to the noblest and most sublime; or perhaps not eventhat, but the best adapted to work out the vast, awful, glorious,eternal designs of the Great Spirit of the Universe. He believesthat the ordained operations of nature, which have brought miseryto him, have, from the very unswerving tranquility of theircareer, showered blessings and sunshine upon many another path;that the unrelenting chariot of Time, which has crushed or maimedhim in its allotted course, is pressing onward to the accomplish-ment of those serene and mighty purposes, to have contributed towhich, even as a victim, is an honor and a recompense. He takesthis view of Time and Nature and God, and yet bears his lot with-out murmur or distrust; because it is a portion of a system, thebest possible, because ordained by God. He does not believe thatGod loses sight of him, while superintending the march of thegreat harmonies of the Universe; nor that it was not foreseen,when the Universe was created, its laws enacted, and the long suc-cession of its operations pre-ordained, that in the great march ofthose events, he would suffer pain and undergo calamity. He be-lieves that his individual good entered into God's consideration, aswell as the great cardinal results to which the course of all thingsis tending.Thus believing, he has attained an eminence in virtue, the high-est, amid passive excellence, which humanity can reach. He findshis reward and his support in the reflection that he is an unreluc-tant and self-sacrificing co-operator with the Creator of the Uni-verse; and in the noble consciousness of being worthy and capableof so sublime a conception, yet so sad a destiny. He is then trulyentitled to be called a Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.He is content to fall early in the battle, if his body may but forma stepping-stone for the future conquests of humanity.It cannot be that God, Who, we are certain, is perfectly good,can choose us to suffer pain, unless either we are ourselves to re-ceive from it an antidote to what is evil in ourselves, or else assuch pain is a necessary part in the scheme of the Universe, whichas a whole is good. In either case, the Mason receives it withsubmission. He would not suffer unless it was ordered so. What-ever his creed, if he believes that God is, and that He cares forHis creatures, he cannot doubt that; nor that it would not havebeen so ordered, unless it was either better for himself, or forsome other persons, or for some things. To complain and lamentis to murmur against God's will, and worse than unbelief.The Mason, whose mind is cast in a nobler mould than those ofthe ignorant and unreflecting, and is instinct with a diviner life,-who loves truth more than rest, and the peace of Heaven ratherthan the peace of Eden,--to whom a loftier being brings severercares,--who knows that man does not live by pleasure or contentalone, but by the presence of the power of God,--must cast be-hind him the hope of any other repose or tranquillity, than thatwhich is the last reward of long agonies of thought; he must re-linquish all prospect of any Heaven save that of which trouble isthe avenue and portal; he must gird up his loins, and trim hislamp, for a work that must be done, and must not be negligentlydone. If he does not like to live in the furnished lodgings of tra-dition, he must build his own house, his own system of faith andthought, for himself.The hope of success, and not the hope of reward, should be ourstimulating and sustaining power. Our object, and not ourselves,should be our inspiring thought. Selfishness is a sin, when tem-porary, and for time. Spun out to eternity, it does not becomecelestial prudence. We should toil and die, not for Heaven orBliss, but for Duty.In the more frequent cases, where we have to join our efforts tothose of thousands of others, to contribute to the carrying forwardof a great cause; merely to till the ground or sow the seed for avery distant harvest, or to prepare the way for the future adventof some great amendment; the amount which each one contrib-utes to the achievement of ultimate success, the portion of theprice which justice should assign to each as his especial produc-tion, can never be accurately ascertained. Perhaps few of thosewho have ever labored, in the patience of secrecy and silence, tobring about some political or social change, which they felt con-vinced would ultimately prove of vast service to humanity, livedto see the change effected, or the anticipated good flow from it.Fewer still of them were able to pronounce what appreciableweight their several efforts contributed to the achievement of thechange desired. Many will doubt, whether, in truth, these exer-tions have any influence whatever; and, discouraged, cease allactive effort.Not to be thus discouraged, the Mason must labor to elevateand purify his motives, as well as sedulously cherish the convic-tion, assuredly a true one, that in this world there is no such thingas effort thrown away; that in all labor there is profit; that allsincere exertion, in a righteous and unselfish cause, is necessarilyfollowed, in spite of all appearance to the contrary, by an appro-priate and proportionate success; that no bread cast upon thewaters can be wholly lost; that no seed planted in the ground canfail to quicken in due time and measure; and that, however wemay, in moments of despondency, be apt to doubt, not onlywhether our cause will triumph, but whether, if it does, we shallhave contributed to its triumph,--there is One, Who has notonly seen every exertion we have made, but Who can assignthe exact degree in which each soldier has assisted to gain thegreat victory over social evil. No good work is done wholly invain.The Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason will in nowisedeserve that honorable title, if he has not that strength, that will,that self-sustaining energy; that Faith, that feeds upon no earthlyhope, nor ever thinks of victory, but, content in its own consum-mation, combats, because it ought to combat, rejoicing fights, andstill rejoicing falls.The Augean Stables of the World, the accumulated uncleannessand misery of centuries, require a mighty river to cleanse themthoroughly away; every drop we contribute aids to swell thatriver and augment its force, in a degree appreciable by God,though not by man; and he whose zeal is deep and earnest, willnot be over-anxious that his individual drops should be distin-guishable amid the mighty mass of cleansing and fertilizingwaters; far less that, for the sake of distinction, it should flow inineffective singleness away.The true Mason will not be careful that his name should beinscribed upon the mite which he casts into the treasury of God.It suffices him to know that if he has labored, with purity of pur-pose, in any good cause, he must have contributed to its success;that the degree in which he has contributed is a matter of infi-nitely small concern; and still more, that the consciousness ofhaving so contributed, however obscurely and unnoticed, is hissufficient, even if it be his sole, reward. Let every Grand Elect,Perfect, and Sublime Mason cherish this faith. It is a duty. Itis the brilliant and never-dying light that shines within andthrough the symbolic pedestal of alabaster, on which reposes theperfect cube of agate, symbol of duty, inscribed with the divinename of God. He who industriously sows and reaps is a goodlaborer, and worthy of his hire. But he who sows that whichshall be reaped by others, by those who will know not of and carenot for the sower, is a laborer of a nobler order, and, worthy of amore excellent reward.The Mason does not exhort others to an ascetic undervaluingof this life, as an insignificant and unworthy portion of existence;for that demands feelings which are unnatural, and which, there-fore, if attained, must be morbid, and if merely professed, insin-cere; and teaches us to look rather to a future life for the com-pensation of social evils, than to this life for their cure; and sodoes injury to the cause of virtue and to that of social progress.Life is real, and is earnest, and it is full of duties to be performed.It is the beginning of our immortality. Those only who feel adeep interest and affection for this world will work resolutely forits amelioration; those whose affections are transferred to Heaven,easily acquiesce in the miseries of earth, deeming them hopeless,befitting, and ordained; and console themselves with the idea ofthe ammends which are one day to be theirs. It is a sad truth, thatthose most decidedly given to spiritual contemplation, and tomaking religion rule in their hearts, are often most apathetic to-ward all improvement of this world's systems, and in many casesvirtual conservatives of evil, and hostile to political and social re-form, as diverting men's energies from eternity.The Mason does not war with his own instincts, macerate thebody into weakness and disorder, and disparage what he sees to bebeautiful, knows to be wonderful, and feels to be unspeakablydear and fascinating. He does not put aside the nature whichGod has given him, to struggle after one which He has not be-stowed. He knows that man is sent into the world, not a spir-itual, but a composite being, made up of body and mind, the bodyhaving, as is fit and needful in a material world, its full, rightful,and allotted share. His life is guided by a full recognition of thisfact. He does not deny it in bold words, and admit it in weak-nesses and inevitable failings. He believes that his spiritualitywill come in the next stage of his being, when he puts on the spir-itual body; that his body will be dropped at death; and that, untilthen, God meant it to be commanded and controlled, but not neg-lected, despised, or ignored by the soul, under pain of heavy con-sequences. Yet the Mason is not indifferent as to the fate of the soul, afterits present life, as to its continued and eternal being, and the char-acter of the scenes in which that being will be fully developed.These are to him topics of the proroundest interest, and the mostennobling and refining contemplation. They occupy much of hisleisure; and as he becomes familiar with the sorrows and calami-ties of this life, as his hopes are disappointed and his visions ofhappiness here fade away; when life has wearied him in itsrace of hours; when he is harassed and toil-worn, and the bur-den of his years weighs heavy on him, the balance of attractiongradually inclines in favor of another life; and he clings to hislofty speculations with a tenacity of interest which needs no in-junction, and will listen to no prohibition. They are the consol-ing privilege of the aspiring, the wayworn, the weary, and thebereaved.To him the contemplation of the Future lets in light upon thePresent, and develops the higher portions of his nature. He en-deavors rightly to adjust the respective claims of Heaven andearth upon his time and thought, so as to give the proper propor-tions thereof to performing the duties and entering into the inter-ests of this world, and to preparation for a better; to the cultiva-tion and purification of his own character, and to the public serviceof his fellow-men.The Mason does not dogmatize, but entertaining and utteringhis own convictions, he leaves every one else free to do the same;and only hopes that the time will come, even if after the lapse ofages, when all men shall form one great family of brethren, andone law alone, the law of love, shall govern God's whole Uni-verse.Believe as you may, my brother; if the Universe is not, to you,without a God, and if man is not like the beast that perishes, buthath an immortal soul, we welcome you among us, to wear, as wewear, with humility, and conscious of your demerits and short-comings, the title of Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.It is not without a secret meaning, that twelve was the num-ber of the Apostles of Christ, and seventy-two that of his Dis-ciples: that John addressed his rebukes and menaces to the Sevenchurches, the number of the Archangels and the Planets. AtBabylon were the Seven Stages of Bersippa, a pyramid of Sevenstories, and at Ecbatana Seven concentric inclosures, each of adifferent color. Thebes also had Seven gates, and the same num-ber is repeated again and again in the account of the flood. TheSephiroth, or Emanations, ten in number, three in one class, andseven in the other, repeat the mystic numbers of Pythagoras.Seven Amschaspands or planetary spirits were invoked withOrmuzd: Seven inferior Rishis of Hindustan were saved with thehead of their family in an ark: and Seven ancient personagesalone returned with the British just man, Hu, from the dale ofthe grievous waters. There were Seven Heliadae, whose fatherHelias, or the Sun, once crossed the sea in a golden cup; SevenTitans, children of the older Titan, Kronos or Saturn; SevenCorybantes; and Seven Cabiri, sons of Sydyk; Seven primevalCelestial spirits of the Japanese, and Seven Karlesters whoescaped from the deluge and began to be the parents of a newrace, on the summit of Mount Albordi. Seven Cyclopes, also,built the walls of Tiryus.Celus, as quoted by Origen, tells us that the Persians repre-sented by symbols the two-fold motion of the stars, fixed andplanetary, and the passage of the Soul through their successivespheres. They erected in their holy caves, in which the mysticrites of the Mithriac Initiations were practised, what he denomi-nates a high ladder, on the Seven steps of which were Sevengates or portals, according to the number of the Seven principalheavenly bodies. Through these the aspirants passed, until theyreached the summit of the whole; and this passage was styled atransmigration through the spheres.Jacob saw in his dream a ladder planted or set on the earth,and its top reaching to Heaven, and the Malaki Alohim ascendingand descending on it, and above it stood IHUH, declaring Himselfto be Ihuh-Alhi Abraham. The word translated ladder, isSalam, from Salal, raised, elevated, reared up, exalted, piledup into a heap, Aggeravit. Salalah, means a heap, rampart,or other accumulation of earth or stone, artificially made; andSalaa or Salo, is a rock or cliff or boulder, and the name ofthe city of Petra. There is no ancient Hebrew word to designatea pyramid.The symbolic mountain Meru was ascended by Seven steps orstages; and all the pyramids and artificial tumuli and hillocksthrown up in flat countries were imitations of this fabulous andmystic mountain, for purposes of worship. These were the "HighPlaces" so often mentioned in the Hebrew books, on which theidolaters sacrificed to foreign gods.The pyramids were sometimes square, and sometimes round.The sacred Babylonian tower [Magdol], dedicated to thegreat Father Bal, was an artificial hill, of pyramidal shape, andSeven stages, built of brick, and each stage of a different color,representing the Seven planetary spheres by the appropriate colorof each planet. Meru itself was said to be a single mountain, ter-minating in three peaks, and thus a symbol of the Trimurti. Thegreat Pagoda at Tanjore was of six stories, surmounted by a tem-ple as the seventh, and on this three spires or towers. An ancientpagoda at Deogur was surmounted by a tower, sustaining themystic egg and a trident. Herodotus tells us that the Temple ofBal at Babylon was a tower composed of Seven towers, resting onan eighth that served as basis, and successively diminishing insize from the bottom to the top; and Strabo tells us it was apyramid.Faber thinks that the Mithriac ladder was really a pyramid withSeven stages, each provided with a narrow door or aperture,through each of which doors the aspirant passed, to reach thesummit, and then descended through similar doors on the oppositeside of the pyramid; the ascent and descent of the Soul beingthus represented.Each Mithriac cave and all the most ancient temples weretended to symbolize the Universe, which itself was habituallycalled the Temple and habitation of Deity. Every temple wasthe world in miniature; and so the whole world was one grandtemple. The most ancient temples were roofless; and thereforethe Persians, Celts, and Scythians strongly disliked artificial cov-ered edifices. Cicero says that Xerxes burned the Grecian tem-ples, on the express ground that the whole world was the Magnifi-cent Temple and Habitation of the Supreme Deity. Macrobiussays that the entire Universe was judiciously deemed by many theTemple of God. Plato pronounced the real Temple of the Deityto be the world; and Heraclitus declared that the Universe, varie-gated with animals and plants and stars was the only genuineTemple of the Divinity.How completely the Temple of Solomon was symbolic, ismanifest, not only from the continual reproduction in it ofthe sacred numbers and of astrological symbols in the histor-ical descriptions of it; but also, and yet more, from the de-tails of the imaginary reconstructed edifice, seen by Ezekielin his vision. The Apocalypse completes the demonstration,and shows the kabalistic meanings of the whole. The Sym-bola Architectonica are found on the most ancient edifices;and these mathematical figures and instruments, adopted bythe Templars, and identical with those on the gnostic seals andabraxae, connect their dogma with the Chaldaic, Syriac, andEgyptian Oriental philosophy. The secret Pythagorean doc-trines of numbers were preserved by the monks of Thibet, bythe Hierophants of Egypt and Eleusis, at Jerusalem, and inthe circular Chapters of the Druids; and they are especiallyconsecrated in that mysterious book, the Apocalypse of SaintJohn.All temples were surrounded by pillars, recording the numberof the constellations, the signs of the zodiac, or the cycles of theplanets; and each one was a microcosm or symbol of the Universe,having for roof or ceiling the starred vault of Heaven.All temples were originally open at the top, having for roof thesky. Twelve pillars described the belt of the zodiac. Whateverthe number of the pillars, they were mystical everywhere. AtAbury, the Druidic temple reproduced all the cycles by its col-umns. Around the temples of Chilminar in Persia, of Baalbec,and of Tukhti Schlomoh in Tartary, on the frontier of China,stood forty pillars. On each side of the temple at Paestum werefourteen, recording the Egyptian cycle of the dark and light sidesof the moon, as described by Plutarch; the whole thirty-eightthat surrounded them recording the two meteoric cycles so oftenfound in the Druidic temples.The theatre built by Scaurus, in Greece, was surrounded by360 columns; the Temple at Mecca, and that at Iona in Scotland,by 360 stones.

XIII. ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON.
WHETHER the legend and history of this Degree are historically true, or but an allegory, containing in itself a deeper truth and a profounder meaning, we shall not now debate. If it be but a legendary myth, you must find out for yourself what it means. It is certain that the word which the Hebrews are not now permitted to pronounce was in common use by Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Laban, Rebecca, and even among tribes foreign to the Hebrews, before the time of Moses; and that it recurs a hundred times in the lyrical effusions of David and other Hebrew poets. We know that for many centuries the Hebrews have been forbidden to pronounce the Sacred Name; that wherever it occurs, they have for ages read the word Adonaï instead; and that under it, when the masoretic points, which represent the vowels, came to be used, they placed those which belonged to the latter word. The possession of the true pronunciation was deemed to confer on him who had it extraordinary and supernatural powers; and the Word itself, worn upon the person, was regarded as an amulet, a protection against personal danger, sickness, and evil spirits. We know that all this was a vain superstition, natural to a rude people, necessarily disappearing as the intellect of man became enlightened; and wholly unworthy of a Mason. It is noticeable that this notion of the sanctity of the Divine Name or Creative Word was common to all the ancient nations. The Sacred Word HOM was supposed by the ancient Persians (who were among the earliest emigrants from Northern India) tobe pregnant with a mysterious power; and they taught that by its utterance the world was created. In India it was forbidden to pronounce the word AUM or OM, the Sacred Name of the One Deity, manifested as Brahma, Vishna, and Seeva. These superstitious notions in regard to the efficacy of the Word, and the prohibition against pronouncing it, could, being errors, have formed no part of the pure primitive religion, or of the esoteric doctrine taught by Moses, and the full knowledge of which was confined to the Initiates; unless the whole was but an ingenious invention for the concealment of some other Name or truth, the interpretation and meaning whereof was made known only to the select few. If so, the common notions in regard to the Word grew up in the minds of the people, like other errors and fables among all the ancient nations, out of original truths and symbols and allegories misunderstood. So it has always been that allegories, intended as vehicles of truth, to be understood by the sages, have become or bred errors, by being literally accepted. It is true, that before the masoretic points were invented (which was after the beginning of the Christian era), the pronunciation of a word in the Hebrew language could not be known from the characters in which it was written. It was, therefore, possible for that of the name of the Deity to have been forgotten and lost. It is certain that its true pronunciation is not that represented by the word Jehovah; and therefore that that is not the true name of Deity, nor the Ineffable Word. The ancient symbols and allegories always had more than one interpretation. They always had a double meaning, and sometimes more than two, one serving as the envelope of the other. Thus the pronunciation of the word was a symbol; and that pronunciation and the word itself were lost, when the knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God faded out of the minds of the Jewish people. That is one interpretation - true, but not the inner and profoundest one. Men were figuratively said to forget the name of God, when they lost that knowledge, and worshipped the heathen deities, and burned incense to them on the high places, and passed their children through the fire to Moloch. Thus the attempts of the ancient Israelites and of the Initiates to ascertain the True Name of the Deity, and its pronunciation, and the loss of the True Word, are an allegory, in which arerepresented the general ignorance of the true nature and attributes of God, the proneness of the people of Judah and Israel to worship other deities, and the low and erroneous and dishonoring notions of the Grand Architect of the Universe, which all shared except a few favored persons; for even Solomon built altars and sacrificed to Astarat, the goddess of the Tsidumm, and Malcüm, the Aamünite god, and built high places for Kamüs, the Moabite deity, and Malec the god of the Beni-Aamün. The true nature of God was unknown to them, like His name; and they worshipped the calves of Jeroboam, as in the desert they did that made for them by Aarün. The mass of the Hebrews did not believe in the existence of one only God until a late period in their history. Their. early and popular ideas of the Deity were singularly low and unworthy. Even while Moses was receiving the law upon Mount Sinai, they forced Aarün to make them an image of the Egyptian god Apis, and fell down and adored it. They were ever ready to return to the worship of the gods of the Mitzraim; and soon after the death of Joshua they became devout worshippers of the false gods of all the surrounding nations. "Ye have borne," Amos, the prophet, said to them, speaking of their forty years' journeying in the desert, under Moses, "the tabernacle of your Malec and Kaiün your idols, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves." Among them, as among other nations, the conceptions of God formed by individuals varied according to their intellectual and spiritual capacities; poor and imperfect, and investing God with the commonest and coarest attributes of humanity, among the ignorant and coarse; pure and lofty among the virtuous and richly gifted. These conceptions gradually improved and became purified and ennobled, as the nation advanced in civilization - being lowest in the historical books, amended in the prophetic writings, and reaching their highest elevation among the poets. Among all the ancient nations there was one faith and one idea of Deity for the enlightened, intelligent, and educated, and another for the common people. To this rule the Hebrews were no exception. Yehovah, to the mass of the people, was like the gods of the nations around them, except that he was the peculiar God, first of the family of Abraham, of that of Isaac, and of that of Jacob, and afterward the National God; and, as they believed, more powerful than the other gods of the same nature worshippedby their neighbors - "Who among the Baalim is like unto thee, O Yehovah?" - expressed their whole creed. The Deity of the early Hebrews talked to Adam and Eve in the garden of delight, as he walked in it in the cool of the day; he conversed with Kayin; he sat and ate with Abraham in his tent; that patriarch required a visible token, before he would believe in his positive promise; he permitted Abraham to expostulate with him, and to induce him to change his first determination in regard to Sodom; he wrestled with Jacob; he showed Moses his person, though not his face; he dictated the minutest police regulations and the dimensions of the tabernacle and its furniture, to the Israelites; he insisted on and delighted in sacrifices and burnt-offerings; he was angry, jealous, and revengeful, as well as wavering and irresolute; he allowed Moses to reason him out of his fixed resolution utterly to destroy his people; he commanded the performance of the most shocking and hideous acts of cruelty and barbarity. He hardened the heart of Pharaoh; he repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto the people of Nineveh; and he did it not, to the disgust and anger of Jonah. Such were the popular notions of the Deity; and either the priests had none better, or took little trouble to correct these notions; or the popular intellect was not enough enlarged to enable them to entertain any higher conceptions of the Almighty. But such were not the ideas of the intellectual and enlightened few among the Hebrews. It is certain that they possessed a knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God; as the same class of men did among the other nations - Zoroaster, Menu, Confucius, Socrates, and Plato. But their doctrines on this subject were esoteric; they did not communicate them to the people at large, but only to a favored few; and as they were communicated in Egypt and India, in Persia and Phoenicia, in Greece and Samothrace, in the greater mysteries, to the Initiates. The communication of this knowledge and other secrets, some of which are perhaps lost, constituted, under other names, what we now call Masonry, or Free or Frank-Masonry. That knowledge was, in one sense, the Lost Word, which was made known to the Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Masons. It would be folly to pretend that the forms of Masonry were the same in those ages as they are now. The present name of the Order, and its titles, and the names of the Degrees now in use, were not then known.Even Blue Masonry cannot trace back its authentic history, with its present Degrees, further than the year 1700, if so far. But, by whatever name it was known in this or the other country, Masonry existed as it now exists, the same in spirit and at heart, not only when Solomon builded the temple, but centuries before - before even the first colonies emigrated into Southern India, Persia, and Egypt, from the cradle of the human race. The Supreme, Self-existent, Eternal, All-wise, All-powerful, Infinitely Good, Pitying, Beneficent, and Merciful Creator and Preserver of the Universe was the same, by whatever name he was called, to the intellectual and enlightened men of all nations. The name was nothing, if not a symbol and representative hieroglyph of his nature and attributes. The name AL represented his remoteness above men, his inaccessibility; BAL and BALA, his might; ALOHIM, his various potencies; IHUH, existence and the generation of things. None of his names, among the Orientals, were the symbols of a divinely infinite love and tenderness, and all-embracing mercy. As MOLOCH or MALEK he was but an omnipotent monarch, a tremendous and irresponsible Will; as ADONAÏ, only an arbitrary LORD and Master; as AL Shadaï, potent and a DESTROYER. To communicate true and correct ideas in respect of the Deity was one chief object of the mysteries. In them, Khürüm the King, and Khürüm the Master, obtained their knowledge of him and his attributes; and in them that knowledge was taught to Moses and Pythagoras. Wherefore nothing forbids you to consider the whole legend of this Degree, like that of the Master's, an allegory, representing the perpetuation of the knowledge of the True God in the sanctuaries of initiation. By the subterranean vaults you may understand the places of initiation, which in the ancient ceremonies were generally under ground. The Temple of Solomon presented a symbolic image of the Universe; and resembled, in its arrangements and furniture, all the temples of the ancient nations that practised the mysteries. The system of numbers was intimately connected with their religions and worship, and has come down to us in Masonry; though the esoteric meaning with which the numbers used by us are pregnant is unknown to the vast majority of those who use them. Those numbers were especially employed that had a reference to the Deity, represented his attributes, or figured in theframe-work of the world, in time and space, and formed more or less the bases of that frame-work. These were universally regarded as sacred, being the expression of order and intelligence, the utterances of Divinity Himself. The Holy of Holies of the Temple formed a cube; in which, drawn on a plane surface, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 lines visible, and three sides or faces. It corresponded with the number four, by which the ancients presented Nature, it being the number of substances or corporeal forms, and of the elements, the cardinal points and seasons, and the secondary colors. The number three everywhere represented the Supreme Being. Hence the name of the Deity, engraven upon the triangular plate, and that sunken into the cube of agate, taught the ancient Mason, and teaches us, that the true knowledge of God, of His nature and His attributes is written by Him upon the leaves of the great Book of Universal Nature, and may be read there by all who are endowed with the requisite amount of intellect and intelligence. This knowledge of God, so written there, and of which Masonry has in all ages been the interpreter, is the Master Mason's Word. Within the Temple, all the arrangements were mystically and symbolically connected with the same system. The vault or ceiling, starred like the firmament, was supported by twelve columns, representing the twelve months of the year. The border that ran around the columns represented the zodiac, and one of the twelve celestial signs was appropriated to each column. The brazen sea was supported by twelve oxen, three looking to each cardinal point of the compass. And so in our day every Masonic Lodge represents the Universe. Each extends, we are told, from the rising to the setting sun, from the South to the North, from the surface of the Earth to the Heavens, and from the same to the centre of the globe. In it are represented the sun, moon, and stars; three great torches in the East, West, and South, forming a triangle, give it light: and, like the Delta or Triangle suspended in the East, and inclosing the Ineffable Name, indicate, by the mathematical equality of the angles and sides, the beautiful and harmonious proportions which govern in the aggregate and details of the Universe; while those sides and angles represent, by their number, three, the Trinity of Power, Wisdom, and Harmony, which presided at the building of this marvellous work These three great lights also represent thegreat mystery of the three principles, of creation, dissolution or destruction, and reproduction or regeneration, consecrated by all creeds in their numerous Trinities. The luminous pedestal, lighted by the perpetual flame within, is a symbol of that light of Reason, given by God to man, by which he is enabled to read in the Book of Nature the record of the thought, the revelation of the attributes of the Deity. The three Masters, Adoniram, Joabert, and Stolkin, are types of the True Mason, who seeks for knowledge from pure motives, and that he may be the better enabled to serve and benefit his fellow-men; while the discontented and presumptuous Masters who were buried in the ruins of the arches represent those who strive to acquire it for unholy purposes, to gain power over their fellows, to gratify their pride, their vanity, or their ambition. The Lion that guarded the Ark and held in his mouth the key wherewith to open it, figuratively represents Solomon, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who preserved and communicated the key to the true knowledge of God, of His laws, and of the profound mysteries of the moral and physical Universe. ENOCH [ Khanõc], we are told, walked with God three hundred years, after reaching the age of sixty-five - "walked with God, and he was no more, for God had taken him." His name signified in the Hebrew, INITIATE or INITIATOR. The legend of the columns, of granite and brass or bronze, erected by him, is probably symbolical. That of bronze, which survived the flood, is supposed to symbolize the mysteries, of which Masonry is the legitimate successor - from the earliest times the custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths, unknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems, and allegories. The legend of this Degree is thus, partially, interpreted. It is of little importance whether it is in anywise historical. For its value consists in the lessons which it inculcates, and the duties which it prescribes to those who receive it. The parables and allegories of the Scriptures are not less valuable than history. Nay, they are more so, because ancient history is little instructive, and truths are concealed in and symbolized by the legend and the myth. There are profounder meanings concealed in the symbols of this Degree, connected with the philosophical system of the HebrewKabalists, which you will learn hereafter, if you should be so fortunate as to advance. They are unfolded in the higher Degrees. The lion [ Arai, Araiah, which also means the altar] still holds in his mouth the key of the enigma of the sphynx. But there is one application of this Degree, that you are now entitled to know; and which, remembering that Khürüm, the Master, is the symbol of human freedom, you would probably discover for yourself. It is not enough for a people to gain its liberty. It must secure it. It must not intrust it to the keeping, or hold it at the pleasure, of any one man. The keystone of the Royal Arch of the great Temple of Liberty is a fundamental law, charter, or constitution; the expression of the fixed habits of thought of the people, embodied in a written instrument, or the result of the slow accretions and the consolidation of centuries; the same in war as in peace; that cannot be hastily changed, nor be violated with impunity, but is sacred, like the Ark of the Covenant of God, which none could touch and live. A permanent constitution, rooted in the affections, expressing the will and judgment, and built upon the instincts and settled habits of thought of the people, with an independent judiciary, an elective legislature of two branches, an executive responsible to the people, and the right of trial by jury, will guarantee the liberties of a people, if it be virtuous and temperate, without luxury, and without the lust of conquest and dominion, and the follies of visionary theories of impossible perfection. Masonry teaches its Initiates that the pursuits and occupations of this life, its activity, care, and ingenuity, the predestined developments of the nature given us by God, tend to promote His great design, in making the world; and are not at war with the great purpose of life. It teaches that everything is beautiful in its time, in its place, in its appointed office; that everything which man is put to do, if rightly and faithfully done, naturally helps to work out his salvation; that if he obeys the genuine principles of his calling, he will be a good man: and that it is only by neglect and nonperformance of the task set for him by Heaven, by wandering into idle dissipation, or by violating their beneficent and lofty spirit, that he becomes a bad man. The appointed action of life is the great training of Providence; and if man yields himselfto it, he will need neither churches nor ordinances, except for the expression of his religious homage and gratitude. For there is a religion of toil. It is not all drudgery, a mere stretching of the limbs and straining of the sinews to tasks. It has a meaning and an intent. A living heart pours life-blood into the toiling arm; and warm affections inspire and mingle with man's labors. They are the home affections. Labor toils a-field, or plies its task in cities, or urges the keels of commerce over wide oceans; but home is its centre; and thither it ever goes with its earnings, with the means of support and comfort for others; offerings sacred to the thought of every true man, as a sacrifice at a golden shrine. Many faults there are amidst the toils of life; many harsh and hasty words are uttered; but still the toils go on, weary and hard and exasperating as they often are. For in that home is age or sickness, or helpless infancy, or gentle childhood, or feeble woman, that must not want. If man had no other than mere selfish impulses, the scene of labor which we behold around us would not exist. The advocate who fairly and honestly presents his case, with feeling of true self-respect, honor, and conscience, to help the tribunal on towards the right conclusion, with a conviction that God's justice reigns there, is acting a religious part, leading that day religious life; or else right and justice are no part of religion Whether, during all that day, he has once appealed, in form or in terms, to his conscience, or not; whether he has once spoken of religion and God, or not; if there has been the inward purpose, the conscious intent and desire, that sacred justice should triumph, he has that day led a good and religious life, and made most a essential contribution to that religion of life and of society, the cause of equity between man and man, and of truth and right action in the world. Books, to be of religious tendency in the Masonic sense, need not be books of sermons, of pious exercises, or of prayers. Whatever inculcates pure, noble, and patriotic sentiments, or touches the heart with the beauty of virtue, and the excellence of an upright life, accords with the religion of Masonry, and is the Gospel of literature and art. That Gospel is preached from many a book and painting, from many a poem and fiction, and review and newspaper; and it is a painful error and miserable narrowness, not to recognize these wide-spread agencies of Heaven's providing; notto see and welcome these many-handed coadjutors, to the great and good cause. The oracles of God do not speak from the pulpit alone. There is also a religion of society. In business, there is much more than sale, exchange, price, payment; for there is the sacred faith of man in man. When we repose perfect confidence in the integrity of another; when we feel that he will not swerve from the right, frank, straightforward, conscientious course, for any temptation; his integrity and conscientiousness are the image of God to us; and when we believe in it, it is as great and generous an act, as when we believe in the rectitude of the Deity. In gay assemblies for amusement, the good affections of life gush and mingle. If they did not, these gathering-places would be as dreary and repulsive as the caves and dens of outlaws and robbers. When friends meet, and hands are warmly pressed, and the eye kindles and the countenance is suffused with gladness, there is a religion between their hearts; and each loves and worships the True and Good that is in the other. It is not policy, or self-interest, or selfishness that spreads such a charm around that meeting, but the halo of bright and beautiful affection. The same splendor of kindly liking, and affectionate regard, shines like the soft overarching sky, over all the world; over all places where men meet, and walk or toil together; not over lovers' bowers and marriage-altars alone, not over the homes of purity and tenderness alone; but over all tilled fields, and busy workshops, and dusty highways, and paved streets. There is not a worn stone upon the sidewalks, but has been the altar of such offerings of mutual kindness; nor a wooden pillar or iron railing against which hearts beating with affection have not leaned. How many soever other elements there are in the stream of life flowing through these channels, that is surely here and everywhere; honest, heartfelt, disinterested, inexpressible affection. Every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion; and its teachings are instruction in religion. For here are inculcated disinterestedness, affection, toleration, devotedness, patriotism, truth, a generous sympathy with those who suffer and mourn, pity for the fallen, mercy for the erring, relief for those in want, Faith, Hope, and Charity. Here we meet as brethren, to learn to know and love each other. Here we greet each other gladly, are lenient to each other's faults, regardful of each other's feelings, ready to relieveeach other's wants. This is the true religion revealed to the ancient patriarchs; which Masonry has taught for many centuries, and which it will continue to teach as long as time endures. If unworthy passions, or selfish, bitter, or revengeful feelings, contempt, dislike, hatred, enter here, they are intruders and n t welcome, strangers uninvited, and not guests. Certainly there are many evils and bad passions, and much hate and contempt and unkindness everywhere in the world. We cannot refuse to see the evil -that is in life. But all is not evil. We still see God in the world. There is good amidst the evil. The hand of mercy leads wealth to the hovels of poverty and sorrow. Truth and simplicity live amid many wiles and sophistries. There are good hearts underneath gay robes, and under tattered garments also. Love clasps the hand of love, amid all the envyings and distractions of showy competition; fidelity, pity, and sympathy hold the long night-watch by the bedside of the suffering neighbor, amidst the surrounding poverty and squalid misery. Devoted men go from city to city to nurse those smitten down by the terrible pestilence that renews at intervals its mysterious marches. Women well-born and delicately nurtured nursed the wounded soldiers in hospitals, before it became fashionable to do so; and even poor lost women, whom God alone loves and pities, tend the plaguestricken with a patient and generous heroism. Masonry and its kindred Orders teach men to love each other, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the sick, and bury the friendless dead. Everywhere God finds and blesses the kindly office, the pitying thought, and the loving heart. There is an element of good in all men's lawful pursuits and a divine spirit breathing in all their lawful affections. The ground on which they tread is holy ground. There is a natural religion of life, answering, with however many a broken tone, to the religion of nature. There is a beauty and glory in Humanity., in man, answering, with however many a mingling shade, to the loveliness of soft landscapes and swelling hills, and the wondrous Men may be virtuous, self-improving, and religious in their employments. Precisely for that, those employments were made. All their social relations, friendship, love , the ties of family, were made to be holy. They may be religious, not by a kind of protestand resistance against their several vocations; but by conformity to their true spirit. Those vocations do not exclude religion; but demand it, for their own perfection. They may be religious laborers, whether in field or factory; religious physicians, lawyers, sculptors, poets, painters, and musicians. They may be religious in all the toils and in all the amusements of life. Their life may be a religion; the broad earth its altar; its incense the very breath of life; its fires ever kindled by the brightness of Heaven. Bound up with our poor, frail life, is the mighty thought that spurns the narrow span of all visible existence. Ever the soul reaches outward, and asks for freedom. It looks forth from the narrow and grated windows of sense, upon the wide immeasurable creation; it knows that around it and beyond it lie outstretched the infinite and everlasting paths. Everything within us and without us ought to stir our minds to admiration and wonder. We are a mystery encompassed with mysteries. The connection of mind with matter is a mystery; the wonderful telegraphic communication between the brain and every part of the body, the power and action of the will. Every familiar step is more than a story in a land of enchantment. The power of movement is as mysterious as the power of thought. Memory, and dreams that are the indistinct echoes of dead memories are alike inexplicable. Universal harmony springs from infinite complication. The momentum of every step we take in our dwelling contributes in part to the order of the Universe. We are connected by ties of thought, and even of matter and its forces, with the whole boundless Universe and all the past and coming generations of men. The humblest object beneath our eye as completely defies our scrutiny as the economy of the most distant star. Every leaf and every blade of grass holds within itself secrets which no human penetration will ever fathom. No man can tell what is its principle of life. No man can know what his power of secretion is. Both are inscrutable mysteries. Wherever we place our hand we lay it upon the locked bosom of mystery. Step where we will, we tread upon wonders. The sea-sands, the clods of the field, the water-worn pebbles on the hills, the rude masses of rock, are traced over and over, in every direction, with a handwriting older and more significant and sublime than all the ancient ruins, and all the overthrown and buried cities that past generationshave left upon the earth; for it is the handwriting of the Almighty. A Mason's great business with life is to read the book of its teaching; to find that life is not the doing of drudgeries, but the hearing of oracles. The old mythology is but a leaf in that book; for it peopled the world with spiritual natures; and science, many-leaved, still spreads before us the same tale of wonder. We shall be just as happy hereafter, as we are pure and upright, and no more, just as happy as our character prepares us to be, and no more. Our moral, like our mental character, is nut formed in a moment; it is the habit of our minds; the result of many thoughts and feelings and efforts, bound together by many natural and strong ties. The great law of Retribution is, that all coming experience is to be affected by every present feeling; every future moment of being must answer for every present moment; one moment, sacrificed to vice, or lost to improvement, is forever sacrificed and lost; an hour's delay to enter the right path, is to put us back so far, in the everlasting pursuit of happiness; and every sin, even of the best men, is to be thus answered for, if not according to the full measure of its illdesert, yet according to a rule of unbending rectitude and impartiality. The law of retribution presses upon every m an, whether he thinks of it or not. It pursues him through all the courses of life, with a step that never falters nor tires, and with an eye that never sleeps. If it were not so, God's government would not be impartial; 'there would be no discrimination; no moral dominion; no light shed upon the mysteries of Providence. Whatsoever a man soweth, that, and not something else, shall he reap. That which we are doing, good or evil, grave or gay, that which we do today and shall do to-morrow; each thought, each feeling, each action, each event; every passing hour, every breathing moment; all are contributing to form the character according to which we are to be judged. Every particle of influence that goes to form that aggregate, - our character, - will, in that future scrutiny, be sifted out from the mass; and, particle by particle, with ages perhaps intervening, fall a distinct contribution to the sum of our joys or woes. Thus every idle word and idle hour will give answer in the judgment. Let us take care, therefore, what we sow. An evil temptation comes upon us; the opportunity of unrighteous gain, or of unhallowedindulgence, either in the sphere of business or pleasure, of society or solitude. We yield; and plant a seed of bitterness and sorrow. To-morrow it will threaten discovery. Agitated and alarmed, we cover the sin, and bury it deep in falsehood and hypocrisy. In the bosom where it lies concealed, in the fertile soil of kindred vices, that sin dies not, but thrives and grows; and other and still other germs of evil gather around the accursed root; until, from that single seed of corruption, there springs up in the soul all that is horrible in habitual lying, knavery, or vice. Loathingly, often, we take each downward step; but a frightful power urges us onward; and the hell of debt, disease, ignominy, or remorse gathers its shadows around Our steps even on earth; and are yet but the beginnings of sorrows. The evil deed may be done in a single moment; but conscience never dies, memory never sleeps; guilt never can become innocence; and remorse can never whisper peace. Beware, thou who art tempted to evil! Beware what thou layest up for the future! Beware what thou layest up in the archives of eternity! Wrong not thy neighbor! lest the thought of him thou injurest, and who suffers by thy act, be to thee a pang which years will not deprive of its bitterness! Break not into the house of innocence, to rifle it of its treasure; lest when many years have passed over thee, the moan of its distress may not have died away from thine ear! Build not the desolate throne of ambition in thy heart; nor be busy with devices, and circumventings, and selfish schemings; lest desolation and loneliness be on thy path, as it stretches into the long futurity! Live not a useless, an impious, or an injurious life! for bound up with that life is the immutable principle of an endless retribution, and elements of God's creating, which will never spend their force, but continue ever to unfold with the ages of eternity. Be not deceived! God has formed thy nature, thus to answer to the future. His law can never be abrogated, nor His justice eluded; and forever and ever it will be true, that "Whatsoever a man soweth, that also he shall reap.”
XIV. GRAND ELECT, PERFECT, AND SUBLIMEMASON.[Perfect Elu.] It is for each individual Mason to discover the secret of Ma-sonry, by reflection upon its symbols and a wise consideration andanalysis of what is said and done in the work. Masonry does notinculcate her truths. She states them, once and briefly; or hintsthem, perhaps, darkly; or interposes a cloud between them andeyes that would be dazzled by them. "Seek, and ye shall find,"knowledge and the truth.The practical object of Masonry is the physical and moralamelioration and the intellectual and spiritual improvement ofindividuals and society. Neither can be effected, except by thedissemination of truth. It is falsehood in doctrines and fallacyin principles, to which most of the miseries of men and the mis-fortunes of nations are owing. Public opinion is rarely right onany point; and there are and always will be important truths tobe substituted in that opinion in the place of many errors andabsurd and injurious prejudices. There are few truths that publicopinion has not at some time hated and persecuted as heresies;and few errors that have not at some time seemed to it truths radi-ant from the immediate presence of God. There are moral mala-dies, also, of man and society, the treatment of which requires notonly boldness, but also, and more, prudence and discretion; sincethey are more the fruit of false and pernicious doctrines, moral,political, and religious, than of vicious inclinations.Much of the Masonic secret manifests itself, without speechrevealing it to him who even partially comprehends all the De-grees in proportion as he receives them; and particularly to thosewho advance to the highest Degrees of the Ancient and AcceptedScottish Rite. That Rite raises a corner of the veil, even in theDegree of Apprentice; for it there declares that Masonry is aworship.Masonry labors to improve the social order by enlighteningmen's minds, warming their hearts with the love of the good, in-spiring them with the great principle of human fraternity, andrequiring of its disciples that their language and actions shall con-form to that principle, that they shall enlighten each other, con-trol their passions, abhor vice, and pity the vicious man as oneafflicted with a deplorable malady.It is the universal, eternal, immutable religion, such as Godplanted it in the heart of universal humanity. No creed has everbeen long-lived that was not built on this foundation. It is thebase, and they are the superstructure. "Pure religion and unde-filed before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless andwidows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from theworld." "Is not this the fast that I have chosen ? to loose thebands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let theoppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke ?" The ministersof this religion are all Masons who comprehend it and are devotedto it; its sacrifices to God are good works, the sacrifices of thebase and disorderly passions, the offering up of self-interest onthe altar of humanity, and perpetual efforts to attain to all themoral perfection of which man is capable.To make honor and duty the steady beacon-lights that shallguide your life-vessel over the stormy seas of time; to do thatwhich it is right to do, not because it will insure you success, orbring with it a reward, or gain the applause of men, or be "thebest policy," more prudent or more advisable; but because it isright, and therefore ought to be done; to war incessantly againsterror, intolerance, ignorance, and vice, and yet to pity those whoerr, to be tolerant even of intolerance, to teach the ignorant, andto labor to reclaim the vicious, are some of the duties of a Mason.A good Mason is one that can look upon death, and see its facewith the same countenance with which he hears its story; thatcan endure all the labors of his life with his soul supporting hisbody, that can equally despise riches when he hath them andwhen he hath them not;that is, not sadder if they are in his neigh-bor's exchequer, nor more lifted up if they shine around about hisown walls; one that is not moved with good fortune coming tohim, nor going from him; that can look upon another man's landswith equanimity and pleasure, as if they were his own; and yetlook upon his own, and use them too, just as if they were anotherman's; that neither spends his goods prodigally and foolishly, noryet keeps them avariciously and like a miser; that weighs notbenefits by weight and number, but by the mind and circumstancesof him who confers them; that never thinks his charity expen-sive, if a worthy person be the receiver; that does nothing foropinion's sake, but everything for conscience, being as careful ofhis thoughts as of his acting in markets and theatres, and in asmuch awe of himself as of a whole assembly; that is, bountifuland cheerful to his friends, and charitable and apt to forgive hisenemies; that loves his country, consults its honor, and obeys itslaws, and desires and endeavors nothing more than that he maydo his duty and honor God. And such a Mason may reckon hislife to be the life of a man, and compute his months, not bythe course of the sun, but by the zodiac and circle of his vir-tues.The whole world is but one republic, of which each nation is afamily, and every individual a child. Masonry, not in anywisederogating from the differing duties which the diversity of statesrequires, tends to create a new people, which, composed of men ofmany nations and tongues, shall all be bound together by thebonds of science, morality, and virtue.Essentially philanthropic, philosophical, and progressive, it hasfor the basis of its dogma a firm belief in the existence of Godand his providence, and of the immortality of the soul; for itsobject, the dissemination of moral, political, philosophical, andreligious truth, and the practice of all the virtues. In every age,its device has been, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," with constitu-tional government, law, order, discipline, and subordination tolegitimate authority--government and not anarchy.But it is neither a political party nor a religious sect. Itbraces all parties and all sects, to form from among them all a vastfraternal association. It recognizes the dignity of human nature,and man's right to such freedom as he is fitted for; and itknows nothing that should place one man below another, exceptignorance, debasement, and crime, and the necessity of subordina-tion to lawful will and authority.It is philanthropic; for it recognizes the great truth that allmen are of the same origin, have common interests, and shouldco-operate together to the same end.Therefore it teaches its members to love one another, to give toeach other mutual assistance and support in all the circumstancesof life, to share each other's pains and sorrows, as well as theirjoys and pleasures; to guard the reputations, respect the opinions,and be perfectly tolerant of the errors, of each other, in mattersof faith and beliefs.It is philisophical because it teaches the great Truths concern-ing the nature and existence of one Supreme Deity, and the exist-ence and immortality of the soul. It revives the Academy ofPlato and the wise teachings of Socrates. It reiterates the max-ims of Pythagoras, Confucius, and Zoroaster, and reverentiallyenforces the sublime lessons of Him who died upon the Cross.The ancients thought that universal humanity acted under theinfluence of two opposing Principles, the Good and the Evil: ofwhich the Good urged men toward Truth, Independence, and De-votedness and the Evil toward Falsehood, Servility, and Selfish-ness. Masonry represents the Good Principle and constantly warsagainst the evil one. It is the Hercules, the Osiris, the Apollo, theMithras, and the Ormuzd, at everlasting and deadly feud withthe demons of ignorance, brutality, baseness, falsehood, slavish-ness of soul, intolerance, superstition, tyranny, meanness, the in-solence of wealth, and bigotry.When despotism and superstition, twin-powers of evil and dark-ness, reigned everywhere and seemed invincible and immortal, itinvented, to avoid persecution, the mysteries, that is to say, theallegory, the symbol, and the emblem, and transmitted its doc-trines by the secret mode of initiation. Now, retaining its ancientsymbols, and in part its ancient ceremonies, it displays in everycivilized country its banner, on which in letters of living light itsgreat principles are written; and it smiles at the puny efforts ofkings and popes to crush it out by excommunication and inter-diction.Man's views in regard to God, will contain only so much posi-tive truth as the human mind is capable of receiving; whetherthat truth is attained by the exercise of reason, or communicatedby revelation. It must necessarily be both limited and alloyed, tobring it within the competence of finite human intelligence. Be-ing finite, we can form no correct or adequate idea of the Infinite;being material, we can form no clear conception of the Spiritual.We do believe in and know the infinity of Space and Time, andthe spirituality of the Soul; but the idea of that infinity andspirituality eludes us. Even Omnipotence cannot infuse infiniteconceptions into finite minds; nor can God, without first entirelychanging the conditions of our being, pour a complete and fullknowledge of His own nature and attributes into the narrowcapacity of a human soul. Human intelligence could not graspit, nor human language express it. The visible is, necessarily, themeasure of the invisible.The consciousness of the individual reveals itself alone. Hisknowledge cannot pass beyond the limits of his own being. Hisconceptions of other things and other beings are only his concep-tions. They are not those things or beings themselves. The livingprinciple of a living Universe must be INFINITE; while all ourideas and conceptions are finite, and applicable only to finite beings.The Deity is thus not an object of knowledge, but of faith; notto be approached by the understanding, but by the moral sense;not to be conceived, but to be felt. All attempts to embrace theInfinite in the conception of the Finite are, and must be only ac-commodations to the frailty of man. Shrouded from human com-prehension in an obscurity from which a chastened imagination isawed back, and Thought retreats in conscious weakness, theDivine Nature is a theme on which man is little entitled to dog-matize. Here the philosophic Intellect becomes most painfullyaware of its own insufficiency.And yet it is here that man most dogmatizes, classifies and de-scribes God's attributes, makes out his map of God's nature, andhis inventory of God's qualities, feelings, impulses, and passions;and then hangs and burns his brother, who, as dogmatically as he,makes out a different map and inventory. The common under-standing has no humility. Its God is an incarnate Divinity. Im-perfection imposes its own limitations on the Illimitable, andclothes the Inconceivable Spirit of the Universe in forms thatcome within the grasp of the senses and the intellect, and arederived from that infinite and imperfect nature which is but God'screation.We are all of us, though not all equally, mistaken. The cher-ished dogmas of each of us are not, as we fondly suppose, the puretruth of God; but simply our own special form of error, ourguesses at truth, the refracted and fragmentary rays of light thathave fallen upon our own minds. Our little systems have theirday, and cease to be; they are but broken lights of God; and Heis more than they. Perfect truth is not attainable anywhere. Westyle this Degree that of Perfection; and yet what it teaches isimperfect and defective. Yet we are not to relax in the pursuitof truth, nor contentedly acquiesce in error. It is our duty alwaysto press forward in the search; for though absolute truth is unat-tainable, yet the amount of error in our views is capable of pro-gressive and perpetual diminution; and thus Masonry is a con-tinual struggle toward the light.All errors are not equally innocuous. That which is most in-jurious is to entertain unworthy conceptions of the nature andattributes of God; and it is this that Masonry symbolizes by igno-rance of the True Word. The true word of a Mason is, not theentire, perfect, absolute truth in regard to God; but the highestand noblest conception of Him that our minds are capable offorming; and this word is Ineffable, because one man cannotcommunicate to another his own conception of Deity; since everyman's conception of God must be proportioned to his mental cul-tivation and intellectual powers, and moral excellence. God is, asman conceives Him, the reflected image of man himself.For every man's conception of God must vary with his mentalcultivation and mental powers. If any one contents himself withany lower image than his intellect is capable of grasping, then hecontents himself with that which is false to him, as well as false infact. If lower than he can reach, he must needs feel it to be false.And if we, of the nineteenth century after Christ, adopt the con-ceptions of the nineteenth century before Him; if our conceptionsof God are those of the ignorant, narrow-minded, and vindictiveIsraelite; then we think worse of God, and have a lower, meaner,and more limited view of His nature, than the faculties which Hehas bestowed are capable of grasping. The highest view we canform is nearest to the truth. If we acquiesce in any lower one,we acquiesce in an untruth. We feel that it is an affront and anindignity to Him, to conceive of Him as cruel, short-sighted, ca-pricious, and unjust; as a jealous, an angry, a vindictive Being.When we examine our conceptions of His character, if we canconceive of a loftier, nobler, higher, more beneficent, glorious, andmagnificent character, then this latter is to us the true conceptionof Deity; for nothing can be imagined more excellent than He.Religion, to obtain currency and influence with the great massof mankind, must needs be alloyed with such an amount of erroras to place it far below the standard attainable by the higherhuman capacities. A religion as pure as the loftiest and most cul-tivated human reason could discern, would not be comprehendedby, or effective over, the less educated portion of mankind. Whatis Truth to the philosopher, would not be Truth, nor have theeffect of Truth, to the peasant. The religion of the many mustnecessarily be more incorrect than that of the refined and reflectivefew, not so much in its essence as in its forms, not so much in thespiritual idea which lies latent at the bottom of it, as in the sym-bols and dogmas in which that idea is embodied. The truestreligion would, in many points, not be comprehended by the igno-rant, nor consolatory to them, nor guiding and supporting forthem. The doctrines of the Bible are often not clothed in thelanguage of strict truth, but in that which was fittest to conveyto a rude and ignorant people the practical essentials of the doc-trine. A perfectly pure faith, free from all extraneous admixtures,a system of noble theism and lofty morality, would find too littlepreparation for it in the common mind and heart, to admit ofprompt reception by the masses of mankind; and Truth mightnot have reached us, if it had not borrowed the wings of Error.The Mason regards God as a Moral Governor, as well as anOriginal Creator; as a God at hand, and not merely one afar offin the distance of infinite space, and in the remoteness of Pastor Future Eternity. He conceives of Him as taking a watchfuland presiding interest in the affairs of the world, and as influenc-ing the hearts and actions of men.To him, God is the great Source of the World of Life and Mat-ter; and man, with his wonderful corporeal and mental frame,His direct work. He believes that God has made men with differ-ent intellectual capacities, and enabled some, by superior intellect-ual power, to see and originate truths which are hidden from themass of men. He believes that when it is His will that mankindshould make some great step forward, or achieve some pregnantdiscovery, He calls into being some intellect of more than ordi-nary magnitude and power, to give birth to new ideas, andgrander conceptions of the Truths vital to Humanity.We hold that God has so ordered matters in this beautiful andharmonious, but mysteriously-governed Universe, that one greatmind after another will arise, from time to time, as such areneeded, to reveal to men the truths that are wanted, and theamount of truth than can be borne. He so arranges, that natureand the course of events shall send men into the world, endowedwith that higher mental and moral organization, in which grandtruths, and sublime gleams of spiritual light will spontaneouslyand inevitably arise. These speak to men by inspiration.Whatever Hiram really was, he is the type, perhaps an imag-inary type, to us, of humanity in its highest phase; an exemplarof what man may and should become, in the course of ages, in hisprogress toward the realization of his destiny; an individual giftedwith a glorious intellect, a noble soul, a fine organization, and aperfectly balanced moral being; an earnest of what humanity maybe, and what we believe it will hereafter be in God's good time;the possibility of the race made real.The Mason believes that God has arranged this glorious but per-plexing world with a purpose, and on a plan. He holds that everyman sent upon this earth, and especially every man of superiorcapacity, has a duty to perform, a mission to fulfill, a baptism tobe baptized with; that every great and good man possesses someportion of God's truth, which he must proclaim to the world, andwhich must bear fruit in his own bosom. In a true and simplesense, he believes all the pure, wise, and intellectual to be inspired,and to be so for the instruction, advancement, and elevation ofmankind. That kind of inspiration, like God's omnipresence, isnot limited to the few writers claimed by Jews, Christians, orMoslems, but is co-extensive with the race. It is the consequenceof a faithful use of our faculties. Each man is its subject, God isits source, and Truth its only test. It differs in degrees, as theintellectual endowments, the moral wealth of the soul, and the de-gree of cultivation of those endowments and faculties differ. It islimited to no sect, age, or nation. It is wide as the world andcommon as God. It was not given to a few men, in the infancyof mankind, to monopolize inspiration, and bar God out of thesoul. We are not born in the dotage and decay of the world. Thestars are beautiful as in their prime; the most ancient Heavensare fresh and strong. God is still everywhere in nature. Wher-ever a heart beats with love, wherever Faith and Reason uttertheir oracles, there is God, as formerly in the hearts of seers andprophets. No soil on earth is so holy as the good man's heart;nothing is so full of God. This inspiration is not given to thelearned alone, not alone to the great and wise, but to every faithfulchild of God. Certain as the open eye drinks in the light, do thepure in heart see God; and he who lives truly, feels Him as a pres-ence within the soul. The conscience is the very voice of Deity.Masonry, around whose altars the Christian, the Hebrew, theMoslem, the Brahmin, the followers of Confucius and Zoroaster,can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer to the one God whois above all the Baalim, must needs leave it to each of its Initiatesto look for the foundation of his faith and hope to the writtenscriptures of his own religion. For itself it finds those truthsdefinite enough, which are written by the finger of God upon theheart of man and on the pages of the book of nature. Views ofreligion and duty, wrought out by the meditations of the studious,confirmed by the allegiance of the good and wise, stamped assterling by the response they find in every uncorrupted mind, com-mend themselves to Masons of every creed, and may well be ac-cepted by all.The Mason does not pretend to dogmatic certainty, nor vainlyimagine such certainty attainable. He considers that if therewere no written revelation, he could safely rest the hopes that ani-mate him and the principles that guide him, on the deductions ofreason and the convictions of instinct and consciousness. He canfind a sure foundation for his religious belief, in these deductionsof the intellect and convictions of the heart. For reason provesto him the existence and attributes of God; and those spiritualinstincts which he feels are the voice of God in his soul, infuseinto his mind a sense of his relation to God, a conviction of thebeneficence of his Creator and Preserver, and a hope of future ex-istence; and his reason and conscience alike unerringly point tovirtue as the highest good, and the destined aim and purpose ofman's life.He studies the wonders of the Heavens, the frame-work andrevolutions of the Earth, the mysterious beauties and adaptationsof animal existence, the moral and material constitution of thehuman creature, so fearfully and wonderfully made; and is satis-fied that God IS; and that a Wise and Good Being is the authorof the starry Heavens above him, and of the moral world withinhim; and his mind finds an adequate foundation for its hopes, itsworship, its principles of action, in the far-stretching Universe, inthe glorious firmament, in the deep, full soul, bursting with un-utterable thoughts.These are truths which every reflecting mind will unhesitatinglyreceive, as not to be surpassed, nor capable of improvement; andfitted, if obeyed, to make earth indeed a Paradise, and man only alittle lower than the angels. The worthlessness of ceremonialobservances, and the necessity of active virtue; the enforcementof purity of heart as the security for purity of life, and of thegovernment of the thoughts, as the originators and forerunners ofaction; universal philanthropy, requiring us to love all men, andto do unto others that and that only which we should think itright, just, and generous for them to do unto us; forgiveness ofinjuries; the necessity of self-sacrifice in the discharge of duty;humility; genuine sincerity, and being that which we seem to be;all these sublime precepts need no miracle, no voice from theclouds, to recommend them to our allegiance, or to assure us oftheir divine origin. They command obedience by virtue of theirinherent rectitude and beauty; and have been, and are, and willbe the law in every age and every country of the world. Godrevealed them to man in the beginning.To the Mason, God is our Father in Heaven, to be Whoseespecial children is the sufficient reward of the peacemakers, to seeWhose face the highest hope of the pure in heart; Who is ever athand to strengthen His true worshippers; to Whom our most fer-vent love is due, our most humble and patient submission; Whosemost acceptable worship is a pure and pitying heart and a benefi-cent life; in Whose constant presence we live and act, to Whosemerciful disposal we are resigned by that death which, we hopeand believe, is but the entrance to a better life; and Whose wisedecrees forbid a man to lap his soul in an elysium of mere indolentcontent.As to our feelings toward Him and our conduct toward man,Masonry teaches little about which men can differ, and little fromwhich they can dissent. He is our Father; and we are all breth-ren. This much lies open to the most ignorant and busy, as fullyas to those who have most leisure and are most learned. Thisneeds no Priest to teach it, and no authority to indorse it; and ifevery man did that only which is consistent with it, it would exilebarbarity, cruelty, intolerance, uncharitableness, perfidy, treach-ery, revenge, selfishness, and all their kindred vices and bad pas-sions beyond the confines of the world.The true Mason, sincerely holding that a Supreme God createdand governs this world, believes also that He governs it by laws,which, though wise, just, and beneficent, are yet steady, unwaver-ing, inexorable. He believes that his agonies and sorrows are or-dained for his chastening, his strengthening, his elaboration anddevelopment; because they are the necessary results of the opera-tion of laws, the best that could be devised for the happiness andpurification of the species, and to give occasion and opportunityfor the practice of all the virtues, from the homeliest and mostcommon, to the noblest and most sublime; or perhaps not eventhat, but the best adapted to work out the vast, awful, glorious,eternal designs of the Great Spirit of the Universe. He believesthat the ordained operations of nature, which have brought miseryto him, have, from the very unswerving tranquility of theircareer, showered blessings and sunshine upon many another path;that the unrelenting chariot of Time, which has crushed or maimedhim in its allotted course, is pressing onward to the accomplish-ment of those serene and mighty purposes, to have contributed towhich, even as a victim, is an honor and a recompense. He takesthis view of Time and Nature and God, and yet bears his lot with-out murmur or distrust; because it is a portion of a system, thebest possible, because ordained by God. He does not believe thatGod loses sight of him, while superintending the march of thegreat harmonies of the Universe; nor that it was not foreseen,when the Universe was created, its laws enacted, and the long suc-cession of its operations pre-ordained, that in the great march ofthose events, he would suffer pain and undergo calamity. He be-lieves that his individual good entered into God's consideration, aswell as the great cardinal results to which the course of all thingsis tending.Thus believing, he has attained an eminence in virtue, the high-est, amid passive excellence, which humanity can reach. He findshis reward and his support in the reflection that he is an unreluc-tant and self-sacrificing co-operator with the Creator of the Uni-verse; and in the noble consciousness of being worthy and capableof so sublime a conception, yet so sad a destiny. He is then trulyentitled to be called a Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.He is content to fall early in the battle, if his body may but forma stepping-stone for the future conquests of humanity.It cannot be that God, Who, we are certain, is perfectly good,can choose us to suffer pain, unless either we are ourselves to re-ceive from it an antidote to what is evil in ourselves, or else assuch pain is a necessary part in the scheme of the Universe, whichas a whole is good. In either case, the Mason receives it withsubmission. He would not suffer unless it was ordered so. What-ever his creed, if he believes that God is, and that He cares forHis creatures, he cannot doubt that; nor that it would not havebeen so ordered, unless it was either better for himself, or forsome other persons, or for some things. To complain and lamentis to murmur against God's will, and worse than unbelief.The Mason, whose mind is cast in a nobler mould than those ofthe ignorant and unreflecting, and is instinct with a diviner life,-who loves truth more than rest, and the peace of Heaven ratherthan the peace of Eden,--to whom a loftier being brings severercares,--who knows that man does not live by pleasure or contentalone, but by the presence of the power of God,--must cast be-hind him the hope of any other repose or tranquillity, than thatwhich is the last reward of long agonies of thought; he must re-linquish all prospect of any Heaven save that of which trouble isthe avenue and portal; he must gird up his loins, and trim hislamp, for a work that must be done, and must not be negligentlydone. If he does not like to live in the furnished lodgings of tra-dition, he must build his own house, his own system of faith andthought, for himself.The hope of success, and not the hope of reward, should be ourstimulating and sustaining power. Our object, and not ourselves,should be our inspiring thought. Selfishness is a sin, when tem-porary, and for time. Spun out to eternity, it does not becomecelestial prudence. We should toil and die, not for Heaven orBliss, but for Duty.In the more frequent cases, where we have to join our efforts tothose of thousands of others, to contribute to the carrying forwardof a great cause; merely to till the ground or sow the seed for avery distant harvest, or to prepare the way for the future adventof some great amendment; the amount which each one contrib-utes to the achievement of ultimate success, the portion of theprice which justice should assign to each as his especial produc-tion, can never be accurately ascertained. Perhaps few of thosewho have ever labored, in the patience of secrecy and silence, tobring about some political or social change, which they felt con-vinced would ultimately prove of vast service to humanity, livedto see the change effected, or the anticipated good flow from it.Fewer still of them were able to pronounce what appreciableweight their several efforts contributed to the achievement of thechange desired. Many will doubt, whether, in truth, these exer-tions have any influence whatever; and, discouraged, cease allactive effort.Not to be thus discouraged, the Mason must labor to elevateand purify his motives, as well as sedulously cherish the convic-tion, assuredly a true one, that in this world there is no such thingas effort thrown away; that in all labor there is profit; that allsincere exertion, in a righteous and unselfish cause, is necessarilyfollowed, in spite of all appearance to the contrary, by an appro-priate and proportionate success; that no bread cast upon thewaters can be wholly lost; that no seed planted in the ground canfail to quicken in due time and measure; and that, however wemay, in moments of despondency, be apt to doubt, not onlywhether our cause will triumph, but whether, if it does, we shallhave contributed to its triumph,--there is One, Who has notonly seen every exertion we have made, but Who can assignthe exact degree in which each soldier has assisted to gain thegreat victory over social evil. No good work is done wholly invain.The Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason will in nowisedeserve that honorable title, if he has not that strength, that will,that self-sustaining energy; that Faith, that feeds upon no earthlyhope, nor ever thinks of victory, but, content in its own consum-mation, combats, because it ought to combat, rejoicing fights, andstill rejoicing falls.The Augean Stables of the World, the accumulated uncleannessand misery of centuries, require a mighty river to cleanse themthoroughly away; every drop we contribute aids to swell thatriver and augment its force, in a degree appreciable by God,though not by man; and he whose zeal is deep and earnest, willnot be over-anxious that his individual drops should be distin-guishable amid the mighty mass of cleansing and fertilizingwaters; far less that, for the sake of distinction, it should flow inineffective singleness away.The true Mason will not be careful that his name should beinscribed upon the mite which he casts into the treasury of God.It suffices him to know that if he has labored, with purity of pur-pose, in any good cause, he must have contributed to its success;that the degree in which he has contributed is a matter of infi-nitely small concern; and still more, that the consciousness ofhaving so contributed, however obscurely and unnoticed, is hissufficient, even if it be his sole, reward. Let every Grand Elect,Perfect, and Sublime Mason cherish this faith. It is a duty. Itis the brilliant and never-dying light that shines within andthrough the symbolic pedestal of alabaster, on which reposes theperfect cube of agate, symbol of duty, inscribed with the divinename of God. He who industriously sows and reaps is a goodlaborer, and worthy of his hire. But he who sows that whichshall be reaped by others, by those who will know not of and carenot for the sower, is a laborer of a nobler order, and, worthy of amore excellent reward.The Mason does not exhort others to an ascetic undervaluingof this life, as an insignificant and unworthy portion of existence;for that demands feelings which are unnatural, and which, there-fore, if attained, must be morbid, and if merely professed, insin-cere; and teaches us to look rather to a future life for the com-pensation of social evils, than to this life for their cure; and sodoes injury to the cause of virtue and to that of social progress.Life is real, and is earnest, and it is full of duties to be performed.It is the beginning of our immortality. Those only who feel adeep interest and affection for this world will work resolutely forits amelioration; those whose affections are transferred to Heaven,easily acquiesce in the miseries of earth, deeming them hopeless,befitting, and ordained; and console themselves with the idea ofthe ammends which are one day to be theirs. It is a sad truth, thatthose most decidedly given to spiritual contemplation, and tomaking religion rule in their hearts, are often most apathetic to-ward all improvement of this world's systems, and in many casesvirtual conservatives of evil, and hostile to political and social re-form, as diverting men's energies from eternity.The Mason does not war with his own instincts, macerate thebody into weakness and disorder, and disparage what he sees to bebeautiful, knows to be wonderful, and feels to be unspeakablydear and fascinating. He does not put aside the nature whichGod has given him, to struggle after one which He has not be-stowed. He knows that man is sent into the world, not a spir-itual, but a composite being, made up of body and mind, the bodyhaving, as is fit and needful in a material world, its full, rightful,and allotted share. His life is guided by a full recognition of thisfact. He does not deny it in bold words, and admit it in weak-nesses and inevitable failings. He believes that his spiritualitywill come in the next stage of his being, when he puts on the spir-itual body; that his body will be dropped at death; and that, untilthen, God meant it to be commanded and controlled, but not neg-lected, despised, or ignored by the soul, under pain of heavy con-sequences. Yet the Mason is not indifferent as to the fate of the soul, afterits present life, as to its continued and eternal being, and the char-acter of the scenes in which that being will be fully developed.These are to him topics of the proroundest interest, and the mostennobling and refining contemplation. They occupy much of hisleisure; and as he becomes familiar with the sorrows and calami-ties of this life, as his hopes are disappointed and his visions ofhappiness here fade away; when life has wearied him in itsrace of hours; when he is harassed and toil-worn, and the bur-den of his years weighs heavy on him, the balance of attractiongradually inclines in favor of another life; and he clings to hislofty speculations with a tenacity of interest which needs no in-junction, and will listen to no prohibition. They are the consol-ing privilege of the aspiring, the wayworn, the weary, and thebereaved.To him the contemplation of the Future lets in light upon thePresent, and develops the higher portions of his nature. He en-deavors rightly to adjust the respective claims of Heaven andearth upon his time and thought, so as to give the proper propor-tions thereof to performing the duties and entering into the inter-ests of this world, and to preparation for a better; to the cultiva-tion and purification of his own character, and to the public serviceof his fellow-men.The Mason does not dogmatize, but entertaining and utteringhis own convictions, he leaves every one else free to do the same;and only hopes that the time will come, even if after the lapse ofages, when all men shall form one great family of brethren, andone law alone, the law of love, shall govern God's whole Uni-verse.Believe as you may, my brother; if the Universe is not, to you,without a God, and if man is not like the beast that perishes, buthath an immortal soul, we welcome you among us, to wear, as wewear, with humility, and conscious of your demerits and short-comings, the title of Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.It is not without a secret meaning, that twelve was the num-ber of the Apostles of Christ, and seventy-two that of his Dis-ciples: that John addressed his rebukes and menaces to the Sevenchurches, the number of the Archangels and the Planets. AtBabylon were the Seven Stages of Bersippa, a pyramid of Sevenstories, and at Ecbatana Seven concentric inclosures, each of adifferent color. Thebes also had Seven gates, and the same num-ber is repeated again and again in the account of the flood. TheSephiroth, or Emanations, ten in number, three in one class, andseven in the other, repeat the mystic numbers of Pythagoras.Seven Amschaspands or planetary spirits were invoked withOrmuzd: Seven inferior Rishis of Hindustan were saved with thehead of their family in an ark: and Seven ancient personagesalone returned with the British just man, Hu, from the dale ofthe grievous waters. There were Seven Heliadae, whose fatherHelias, or the Sun, once crossed the sea in a golden cup; SevenTitans, children of the older Titan, Kronos or Saturn; SevenCorybantes; and Seven Cabiri, sons of Sydyk; Seven primevalCelestial spirits of the Japanese, and Seven Karlesters whoescaped from the deluge and began to be the parents of a newrace, on the summit of Mount Albordi. Seven Cyclopes, also,built the walls of Tiryus.Celus, as quoted by Origen, tells us that the Persians repre-sented by symbols the two-fold motion of the stars, fixed andplanetary, and the passage of the Soul through their successivespheres. They erected in their holy caves, in which the mysticrites of the Mithriac Initiations were practised, what he denomi-nates a high ladder, on the Seven steps of which were Sevengates or portals, according to the number of the Seven principalheavenly bodies. Through these the aspirants passed, until theyreached the summit of the whole; and this passage was styled atransmigration through the spheres.Jacob saw in his dream a ladder planted or set on the earth,and its top reaching to Heaven, and the Malaki Alohim ascendingand descending on it, and above it stood IHUH, declaring Himselfto be Ihuh-Alhi Abraham. The word translated ladder, isSalam, from Salal, raised, elevated, reared up, exalted, piledup into a heap, Aggeravit. Salalah, means a heap, rampart,or other accumulation of earth or stone, artificially made; andSalaa or Salo, is a rock or cliff or boulder, and the name ofthe city of Petra. There is no ancient Hebrew word to designatea pyramid.The symbolic mountain Meru was ascended by Seven steps orstages; and all the pyramids and artificial tumuli and hillocksthrown up in flat countries were imitations of this fabulous andmystic mountain, for purposes of worship. These were the "HighPlaces" so often mentioned in the Hebrew books, on which theidolaters sacrificed to foreign gods.The pyramids were sometimes square, and sometimes round.The sacred Babylonian tower [Magdol], dedicated to thegreat Father Bal, was an artificial hill, of pyramidal shape, andSeven stages, built of brick, and each stage of a different color,representing the Seven planetary spheres by the appropriate colorof each planet. Meru itself was said to be a single mountain, ter-minating in three peaks, and thus a symbol of the Trimurti. Thegreat Pagoda at Tanjore was of six stories, surmounted by a tem-ple as the seventh, and on this three spires or towers. An ancientpagoda at Deogur was surmounted by a tower, sustaining themystic egg and a trident. Herodotus tells us that the Temple ofBal at Babylon was a tower composed of Seven towers, resting onan eighth that served as basis, and successively diminishing insize from the bottom to the top; and Strabo tells us it was apyramid.Faber thinks that the Mithriac ladder was really a pyramid withSeven stages, each provided with a narrow door or aperture,through each of which doors the aspirant passed, to reach thesummit, and then descended through similar doors on the oppositeside of the pyramid; the ascent and descent of the Soul beingthus represented.Each Mithriac cave and all the most ancient temples weretended to symbolize the Universe, which itself was habituallycalled the Temple and habitation of Deity. Every temple wasthe world in miniature; and so the whole world was one grandtemple. The most ancient temples were roofless; and thereforethe Persians, Celts, and Scythians strongly disliked artificial cov-ered edifices. Cicero says that Xerxes burned the Grecian tem-ples, on the express ground that the whole world was the Magnifi-cent Temple and Habitation of the Supreme Deity. Macrobiussays that the entire Universe was judiciously deemed by many theTemple of God. Plato pronounced the real Temple of the Deityto be the world; and Heraclitus declared that the Universe, varie-gated with animals and plants and stars was the only genuineTemple of the Divinity.How completely the Temple of Solomon was symbolic, ismanifest, not only from the continual reproduction in it ofthe sacred numbers and of astrological symbols in the histor-ical descriptions of it; but also, and yet more, from the de-tails of the imaginary reconstructed edifice, seen by Ezekielin his vision. The Apocalypse completes the demonstration,and shows the kabalistic meanings of the whole. The Sym-bola Architectonica are found on the most ancient edifices;and these mathematical figures and instruments, adopted bythe Templars, and identical with those on the gnostic seals andabraxae, connect their dogma with the Chaldaic, Syriac, andEgyptian Oriental philosophy. The secret Pythagorean doc-trines of numbers were preserved by the monks of Thibet, bythe Hierophants of Egypt and Eleusis, at Jerusalem, and inthe circular Chapters of the Druids; and they are especiallyconsecrated in that mysterious book, the Apocalypse of SaintJohn.All temples were surrounded by pillars, recording the numberof the constellations, the signs of the zodiac, or the cycles of theplanets; and each one was a microcosm or symbol of the Universe,having for roof or ceiling the starred vault of Heaven.All temples were originally open at the top, having for roof thesky. Twelve pillars described the belt of the zodiac. Whateverthe number of the pillars, they were mystical everywhere. AtAbury, the Druidic temple reproduced all the cycles by its col-umns. Around the temples of Chilminar in Persia, of Baalbec,and of Tukhti Schlomoh in Tartary, on the frontier of China,stood forty pillars. On each side of the temple at Paestum werefourteen, recording the Egyptian cycle of the dark and light sidesof the moon, as described by Plutarch; the whole thirty-eightthat surrounded them recording the two meteoric cycles so oftenfound in the Druidic temples.The theatre built by Scaurus, in Greece, was surrounded by360 columns; the Temple at Mecca, and that at Iona in Scotland,by 360 stones.

XIV. GRAND ELECT, PERFECT, AND SUBLIMEMASON.[Perfect Elu.]
It is for each individual Mason to discover the secret of Ma-sonry, by reflection upon its symbols and a wise consideration andanalysis of what is said and done in the work. Masonry does notinculcate her truths. She states them, once and briefly; or hintsthem, perhaps, darkly; or interposes a cloud between them andeyes that would be dazzled by them. "Seek, and ye shall find,"knowledge and the truth.The practical object of Masonry is the physical and moralamelioration and the intellectual and spiritual improvement ofindividuals and society. Neither can be effected, except by thedissemination of truth. It is falsehood in doctrines and fallacyin principles, to which most of the miseries of men and the mis-fortunes of nations are owing. Public opinion is rarely right onany point; and there are and always will be important truths tobe substituted in that opinion in the place of many errors andabsurd and injurious prejudices. There are few truths that publicopinion has not at some time hated and persecuted as heresies;and few errors that have not at some time seemed to it truths radi-ant from the immediate presence of God. There are moral mala-dies, also, of man and society, the treatment of which requires notonly boldness, but also, and more, prudence and discretion; sincethey are more the fruit of false and pernicious doctrines, moral,political, and religious, than of vicious inclinations.Much of the Masonic secret manifests itself, without speechrevealing it to him who even partially comprehends all the De-grees in proportion as he receives them; and particularly to thosewho advance to the highest Degrees of the Ancient and AcceptedScottish Rite. That Rite raises a corner of the veil, even in theDegree of Apprentice; for it there declares that Masonry is aworship.Masonry labors to improve the social order by enlighteningmen's minds, warming their hearts with the love of the good, in-spiring them with the great principle of human fraternity, andrequiring of its disciples that their language and actions shall con-form to that principle, that they shall enlighten each other, con-trol their passions, abhor vice, and pity the vicious man as oneafflicted with a deplorable malady.It is the universal, eternal, immutable religion, such as Godplanted it in the heart of universal humanity. No creed has everbeen long-lived that was not built on this foundation. It is thebase, and they are the superstructure. "Pure religion and unde-filed before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless andwidows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from theworld." "Is not this the fast that I have chosen ? to loose thebands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let theoppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke ?" The ministersof this religion are all Masons who comprehend it and are devotedto it; its sacrifices to God are good works, the sacrifices of thebase and disorderly passions, the offering up of self-interest onthe altar of humanity, and perpetual efforts to attain to all themoral perfection of which man is capable.To make honor and duty the steady beacon-lights that shallguide your life-vessel over the stormy seas of time; to do thatwhich it is right to do, not because it will insure you success, orbring with it a reward, or gain the applause of men, or be "thebest policy," more prudent or more advisable; but because it isright, and therefore ought to be done; to war incessantly againsterror, intolerance, ignorance, and vice, and yet to pity those whoerr, to be tolerant even of intolerance, to teach the ignorant, andto labor to reclaim the vicious, are some of the duties of a Mason.A good Mason is one that can look upon death, and see its facewith the same countenance with which he hears its story; thatcan endure all the labors of his life with his soul supporting hisbody, that can equally despise riches when he hath them andwhen he hath them not;that is, not sadder if they are in his neigh-bor's exchequer, nor more lifted up if they shine around about hisown walls; one that is not moved with good fortune coming tohim, nor going from him; that can look upon another man's landswith equanimity and pleasure, as if they were his own; and yetlook upon his own, and use them too, just as if they were anotherman's; that neither spends his goods prodigally and foolishly, noryet keeps them avariciously and like a miser; that weighs notbenefits by weight and number, but by the mind and circumstancesof him who confers them; that never thinks his charity expen-sive, if a worthy person be the receiver; that does nothing foropinion's sake, but everything for conscience, being as careful ofhis thoughts as of his acting in markets and theatres, and in asmuch awe of himself as of a whole assembly; that is, bountifuland cheerful to his friends, and charitable and apt to forgive hisenemies; that loves his country, consults its honor, and obeys itslaws, and desires and endeavors nothing more than that he maydo his duty and honor God. And such a Mason may reckon hislife to be the life of a man, and compute his months, not bythe course of the sun, but by the zodiac and circle of his vir-tues.The whole world is but one republic, of which each nation is afamily, and every individual a child. Masonry, not in anywisederogating from the differing duties which the diversity of statesrequires, tends to create a new people, which, composed of men ofmany nations and tongues, shall all be bound together by thebonds of science, morality, and virtue.Essentially philanthropic, philosophical, and progressive, it hasfor the basis of its dogma a firm belief in the existence of Godand his providence, and of the immortality of the soul; for itsobject, the dissemination of moral, political, philosophical, andreligious truth, and the practice of all the virtues. In every age,its device has been, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," with constitu-tional government, law, order, discipline, and subordination tolegitimate authority--government and not anarchy.But it is neither a political party nor a religious sect. Itbraces all parties and all sects, to form from among them all a vastfraternal association. It recognizes the dignity of human nature,and man's right to such freedom as he is fitted for; and itknows nothing that should place one man below another, exceptignorance, debasement, and crime, and the necessity of subordina-tion to lawful will and authority.It is philanthropic; for it recognizes the great truth that allmen are of the same origin, have common interests, and shouldco-operate together to the same end.Therefore it teaches its members to love one another, to give toeach other mutual assistance and support in all the circumstancesof life, to share each other's pains and sorrows, as well as theirjoys and pleasures; to guard the reputations, respect the opinions,and be perfectly tolerant of the errors, of each other, in mattersof faith and beliefs.It is philisophical because it teaches the great Truths concern-ing the nature and existence of one Supreme Deity, and the exist-ence and immortality of the soul. It revives the Academy ofPlato and the wise teachings of Socrates. It reiterates the max-ims of Pythagoras, Confucius, and Zoroaster, and reverentiallyenforces the sublime lessons of Him who died upon the Cross.The ancients thought that universal humanity acted under theinfluence of two opposing Principles, the Good and the Evil: ofwhich the Good urged men toward Truth, Independence, and De-votedness and the Evil toward Falsehood, Servility, and Selfish-ness. Masonry represents the Good Principle and constantly warsagainst the evil one. It is the Hercules, the Osiris, the Apollo, theMithras, and the Ormuzd, at everlasting and deadly feud withthe demons of ignorance, brutality, baseness, falsehood, slavish-ness of soul, intolerance, superstition, tyranny, meanness, the in-solence of wealth, and bigotry.When despotism and superstition, twin-powers of evil and dark-ness, reigned everywhere and seemed invincible and immortal, itinvented, to avoid persecution, the mysteries, that is to say, theallegory, the symbol, and the emblem, and transmitted its doc-trines by the secret mode of initiation. Now, retaining its ancientsymbols, and in part its ancient ceremonies, it displays in everycivilized country its banner, on which in letters of living light itsgreat principles are written; and it smiles at the puny efforts ofkings and popes to crush it out by excommunication and inter-diction.Man's views in regard to God, will contain only so much posi-tive truth as the human mind is capable of receiving; whetherthat truth is attained by the exercise of reason, or communicatedby revelation. It must necessarily be both limited and alloyed, tobring it within the competence of finite human intelligence. Be-ing finite, we can form no correct or adequate idea of the Infinite;being material, we can form no clear conception of the Spiritual.We do believe in and know the infinity of Space and Time, andthe spirituality of the Soul; but the idea of that infinity andspirituality eludes us. Even Omnipotence cannot infuse infiniteconceptions into finite minds; nor can God, without first entirelychanging the conditions of our being, pour a complete and fullknowledge of His own nature and attributes into the narrowcapacity of a human soul. Human intelligence could not graspit, nor human language express it. The visible is, necessarily, themeasure of the invisible.The consciousness of the individual reveals itself alone. Hisknowledge cannot pass beyond the limits of his own being. Hisconceptions of other things and other beings are only his concep-tions. They are not those things or beings themselves. The livingprinciple of a living Universe must be INFINITE; while all ourideas and conceptions are finite, and applicable only to finite beings.The Deity is thus not an object of knowledge, but of faith; notto be approached by the understanding, but by the moral sense;not to be conceived, but to be felt. All attempts to embrace theInfinite in the conception of the Finite are, and must be only ac-commodations to the frailty of man. Shrouded from human com-prehension in an obscurity from which a chastened imagination isawed back, and Thought retreats in conscious weakness, theDivine Nature is a theme on which man is little entitled to dog-matize. Here the philosophic Intellect becomes most painfullyaware of its own insufficiency.And yet it is here that man most dogmatizes, classifies and de-scribes God's attributes, makes out his map of God's nature, andhis inventory of God's qualities, feelings, impulses, and passions;and then hangs and burns his brother, who, as dogmatically as he,makes out a different map and inventory. The common under-standing has no humility. Its God is an incarnate Divinity. Im-perfection imposes its own limitations on the Illimitable, andclothes the Inconceivable Spirit of the Universe in forms thatcome within the grasp of the senses and the intellect, and arederived from that infinite and imperfect nature which is but God'screation.We are all of us, though not all equally, mistaken. The cher-ished dogmas of each of us are not, as we fondly suppose, the puretruth of God; but simply our own special form of error, ourguesses at truth, the refracted and fragmentary rays of light thathave fallen upon our own minds. Our little systems have theirday, and cease to be; they are but broken lights of God; and Heis more than they. Perfect truth is not attainable anywhere. Westyle this Degree that of Perfection; and yet what it teaches isimperfect and defective. Yet we are not to relax in the pursuitof truth, nor contentedly acquiesce in error. It is our duty alwaysto press forward in the search; for though absolute truth is unat-tainable, yet the amount of error in our views is capable of pro-gressive and perpetual diminution; and thus Masonry is a con-tinual struggle toward the light.All errors are not equally innocuous. That which is most in-jurious is to entertain unworthy conceptions of the nature andattributes of God; and it is this that Masonry symbolizes by igno-rance of the True Word. The true word of a Mason is, not theentire, perfect, absolute truth in regard to God; but the highestand noblest conception of Him that our minds are capable offorming; and this word is Ineffable, because one man cannotcommunicate to another his own conception of Deity; since everyman's conception of God must be proportioned to his mental cul-tivation and intellectual powers, and moral excellence. God is, asman conceives Him, the reflected image of man himself.For every man's conception of God must vary with his mentalcultivation and mental powers. If any one contents himself withany lower image than his intellect is capable of grasping, then hecontents himself with that which is false to him, as well as false infact. If lower than he can reach, he must needs feel it to be false.And if we, of the nineteenth century after Christ, adopt the con-ceptions of the nineteenth century before Him; if our conceptionsof God are those of the ignorant, narrow-minded, and vindictiveIsraelite; then we think worse of God, and have a lower, meaner,and more limited view of His nature, than the faculties which Hehas bestowed are capable of grasping. The highest view we canform is nearest to the truth. If we acquiesce in any lower one,we acquiesce in an untruth. We feel that it is an affront and anindignity to Him, to conceive of Him as cruel, short-sighted, ca-pricious, and unjust; as a jealous, an angry, a vindictive Being.When we examine our conceptions of His character, if we canconceive of a loftier, nobler, higher, more beneficent, glorious, andmagnificent character, then this latter is to us the true conceptionof Deity; for nothing can be imagined more excellent than He.Religion, to obtain currency and influence with the great massof mankind, must needs be alloyed with such an amount of erroras to place it far below the standard attainable by the higherhuman capacities. A religion as pure as the loftiest and most cul-tivated human reason could discern, would not be comprehendedby, or effective over, the less educated portion of mankind. Whatis Truth to the philosopher, would not be Truth, nor have theeffect of Truth, to the peasant. The religion of the many mustnecessarily be more incorrect than that of the refined and reflectivefew, not so much in its essence as in its forms, not so much in thespiritual idea which lies latent at the bottom of it, as in the sym-bols and dogmas in which that idea is embodied. The truestreligion would, in many points, not be comprehended by the igno-rant, nor consolatory to them, nor guiding and supporting forthem. The doctrines of the Bible are often not clothed in thelanguage of strict truth, but in that which was fittest to conveyto a rude and ignorant people the practical essentials of the doc-trine. A perfectly pure faith, free from all extraneous admixtures,a system of noble theism and lofty morality, would find too littlepreparation for it in the common mind and heart, to admit ofprompt reception by the masses of mankind; and Truth mightnot have reached us, if it had not borrowed the wings of Error.The Mason regards God as a Moral Governor, as well as anOriginal Creator; as a God at hand, and not merely one afar offin the distance of infinite space, and in the remoteness of Pastor Future Eternity. He conceives of Him as taking a watchfuland presiding interest in the affairs of the world, and as influenc-ing the hearts and actions of men.To him, God is the great Source of the World of Life and Mat-ter; and man, with his wonderful corporeal and mental frame,His direct work. He believes that God has made men with differ-ent intellectual capacities, and enabled some, by superior intellect-ual power, to see and originate truths which are hidden from themass of men. He believes that when it is His will that mankindshould make some great step forward, or achieve some pregnantdiscovery, He calls into being some intellect of more than ordi-nary magnitude and power, to give birth to new ideas, andgrander conceptions of the Truths vital to Humanity.We hold that God has so ordered matters in this beautiful andharmonious, but mysteriously-governed Universe, that one greatmind after another will arise, from time to time, as such areneeded, to reveal to men the truths that are wanted, and theamount of truth than can be borne. He so arranges, that natureand the course of events shall send men into the world, endowedwith that higher mental and moral organization, in which grandtruths, and sublime gleams of spiritual light will spontaneouslyand inevitably arise. These speak to men by inspiration.Whatever Hiram really was, he is the type, perhaps an imag-inary type, to us, of humanity in its highest phase; an exemplarof what man may and should become, in the course of ages, in hisprogress toward the realization of his destiny; an individual giftedwith a glorious intellect, a noble soul, a fine organization, and aperfectly balanced moral being; an earnest of what humanity maybe, and what we believe it will hereafter be in God's good time;the possibility of the race made real.The Mason believes that God has arranged this glorious but per-plexing world with a purpose, and on a plan. He holds that everyman sent upon this earth, and especially every man of superiorcapacity, has a duty to perform, a mission to fulfill, a baptism tobe baptized with; that every great and good man possesses someportion of God's truth, which he must proclaim to the world, andwhich must bear fruit in his own bosom. In a true and simplesense, he believes all the pure, wise, and intellectual to be inspired,and to be so for the instruction, advancement, and elevation ofmankind. That kind of inspiration, like God's omnipresence, isnot limited to the few writers claimed by Jews, Christians, orMoslems, but is co-extensive with the race. It is the consequenceof a faithful use of our faculties. Each man is its subject, God isits source, and Truth its only test. It differs in degrees, as theintellectual endowments, the moral wealth of the soul, and the de-gree of cultivation of those endowments and faculties differ. It islimited to no sect, age, or nation. It is wide as the world andcommon as God. It was not given to a few men, in the infancyof mankind, to monopolize inspiration, and bar God out of thesoul. We are not born in the dotage and decay of the world. Thestars are beautiful as in their prime; the most ancient Heavensare fresh and strong. God is still everywhere in nature. Wher-ever a heart beats with love, wherever Faith and Reason uttertheir oracles, there is God, as formerly in the hearts of seers andprophets. No soil on earth is so holy as the good man's heart;nothing is so full of God. This inspiration is not given to thelearned alone, not alone to the great and wise, but to every faithfulchild of God. Certain as the open eye drinks in the light, do thepure in heart see God; and he who lives truly, feels Him as a pres-ence within the soul. The conscience is the very voice of Deity.Masonry, around whose altars the Christian, the Hebrew, theMoslem, the Brahmin, the followers of Confucius and Zoroaster,can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer to the one God whois above all the Baalim, must needs leave it to each of its Initiatesto look for the foundation of his faith and hope to the writtenscriptures of his own religion. For itself it finds those truthsdefinite enough, which are written by the finger of God upon theheart of man and on the pages of the book of nature. Views ofreligion and duty, wrought out by the meditations of the studious,confirmed by the allegiance of the good and wise, stamped assterling by the response they find in every uncorrupted mind, com-mend themselves to Masons of every creed, and may well be ac-cepted by all.The Mason does not pretend to dogmatic certainty, nor vainlyimagine such certainty attainable. He considers that if therewere no written revelation, he could safely rest the hopes that ani-mate him and the principles that guide him, on the deductions ofreason and the convictions of instinct and consciousness. He canfind a sure foundation for his religious belief, in these deductionsof the intellect and convictions of the heart. For reason provesto him the existence and attributes of God; and those spiritualinstincts which he feels are the voice of God in his soul, infuseinto his mind a sense of his relation to God, a conviction of thebeneficence of his Creator and Preserver, and a hope of future ex-istence; and his reason and conscience alike unerringly point tovirtue as the highest good, and the destined aim and purpose ofman's life.He studies the wonders of the Heavens, the frame-work andrevolutions of the Earth, the mysterious beauties and adaptationsof animal existence, the moral and material constitution of thehuman creature, so fearfully and wonderfully made; and is satis-fied that God IS; and that a Wise and Good Being is the authorof the starry Heavens above him, and of the moral world withinhim; and his mind finds an adequate foundation for its hopes, itsworship, its principles of action, in the far-stretching Universe, inthe glorious firmament, in the deep, full soul, bursting with un-utterable thoughts.These are truths which every reflecting mind will unhesitatinglyreceive, as not to be surpassed, nor capable of improvement; andfitted, if obeyed, to make earth indeed a Paradise, and man only alittle lower than the angels. The worthlessness of ceremonialobservances, and the necessity of active virtue; the enforcementof purity of heart as the security for purity of life, and of thegovernment of the thoughts, as the originators and forerunners ofaction; universal philanthropy, requiring us to love all men, andto do unto others that and that only which we should think itright, just, and generous for them to do unto us; forgiveness ofinjuries; the necessity of self-sacrifice in the discharge of duty;humility; genuine sincerity, and being that which we seem to be;all these sublime precepts need no miracle, no voice from theclouds, to recommend them to our allegiance, or to assure us oftheir divine origin. They command obedience by virtue of theirinherent rectitude and beauty; and have been, and are, and willbe the law in every age and every country of the world. Godrevealed them to man in the beginning.To the Mason, God is our Father in Heaven, to be Whoseespecial children is the sufficient reward of the peacemakers, to seeWhose face the highest hope of the pure in heart; Who is ever athand to strengthen His true worshippers; to Whom our most fer-vent love is due, our most humble and patient submission; Whosemost acceptable worship is a pure and pitying heart and a benefi-cent life; in Whose constant presence we live and act, to Whosemerciful disposal we are resigned by that death which, we hopeand believe, is but the entrance to a better life; and Whose wisedecrees forbid a man to lap his soul in an elysium of mere indolentcontent.As to our feelings toward Him and our conduct toward man,Masonry teaches little about which men can differ, and little fromwhich they can dissent. He is our Father; and we are all breth-ren. This much lies open to the most ignorant and busy, as fullyas to those who have most leisure and are most learned. Thisneeds no Priest to teach it, and no authority to indorse it; and ifevery man did that only which is consistent with it, it would exilebarbarity, cruelty, intolerance, uncharitableness, perfidy, treach-ery, revenge, selfishness, and all their kindred vices and bad pas-sions beyond the confines of the world.The true Mason, sincerely holding that a Supreme God createdand governs this world, believes also that He governs it by laws,which, though wise, just, and beneficent, are yet steady, unwaver-ing, inexorable. He believes that his agonies and sorrows are or-dained for his chastening, his strengthening, his elaboration anddevelopment; because they are the necessary results of the opera-tion of laws, the best that could be devised for the happiness andpurification of the species, and to give occasion and opportunityfor the practice of all the virtues, from the homeliest and mostcommon, to the noblest and most sublime; or perhaps not eventhat, but the best adapted to work out the vast, awful, glorious,eternal designs of the Great Spirit of the Universe. He believesthat the ordained operations of nature, which have brought miseryto him, have, from the very unswerving tranquility of theircareer, showered blessings and sunshine upon many another path;that the unrelenting chariot of Time, which has crushed or maimedhim in its allotted course, is pressing onward to the accomplish-ment of those serene and mighty purposes, to have contributed towhich, even as a victim, is an honor and a recompense. He takesthis view of Time and Nature and God, and yet bears his lot with-out murmur or distrust; because it is a portion of a system, thebest possible, because ordained by God. He does not believe thatGod loses sight of him, while superintending the march of thegreat harmonies of the Universe; nor that it was not foreseen,when the Universe was created, its laws enacted, and the long suc-cession of its operations pre-ordained, that in the great march ofthose events, he would suffer pain and undergo calamity. He be-lieves that his individual good entered into God's consideration, aswell as the great cardinal results to which the course of all thingsis tending.Thus believing, he has attained an eminence in virtue, the high-est, amid passive excellence, which humanity can reach. He findshis reward and his support in the reflection that he is an unreluc-tant and self-sacrificing co-operator with the Creator of the Uni-verse; and in the noble consciousness of being worthy and capableof so sublime a conception, yet so sad a destiny. He is then trulyentitled to be called a Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.He is content to fall early in the battle, if his body may but forma stepping-stone for the future conquests of humanity.It cannot be that God, Who, we are certain, is perfectly good,can choose us to suffer pain, unless either we are ourselves to re-ceive from it an antidote to what is evil in ourselves, or else assuch pain is a necessary part in the scheme of the Universe, whichas a whole is good. In either case, the Mason receives it withsubmission. He would not suffer unless it was ordered so. What-ever his creed, if he believes that God is, and that He cares forHis creatures, he cannot doubt that; nor that it would not havebeen so ordered, unless it was either better for himself, or forsome other persons, or for some things. To complain and lamentis to murmur against God's will, and worse than unbelief.The Mason, whose mind is cast in a nobler mould than those ofthe ignorant and unreflecting, and is instinct with a diviner life,-who loves truth more than rest, and the peace of Heaven ratherthan the peace of Eden,--to whom a loftier being brings severercares,--who knows that man does not live by pleasure or contentalone, but by the presence of the power of God,--must cast be-hind him the hope of any other repose or tranquillity, than thatwhich is the last reward of long agonies of thought; he must re-linquish all prospect of any Heaven save that of which trouble isthe avenue and portal; he must gird up his loins, and trim hislamp, for a work that must be done, and must not be negligentlydone. If he does not like to live in the furnished lodgings of tra-dition, he must build his own house, his own system of faith andthought, for himself.The hope of success, and not the hope of reward, should be ourstimulating and sustaining power. Our object, and not ourselves,should be our inspiring thought. Selfishness is a sin, when tem-porary, and for time. Spun out to eternity, it does not becomecelestial prudence. We should toil and die, not for Heaven orBliss, but for Duty.In the more frequent cases, where we have to join our efforts tothose of thousands of others, to contribute to the carrying forwardof a great cause; merely to till the ground or sow the seed for avery distant harvest, or to prepare the way for the future adventof some great amendment; the amount which each one contrib-utes to the achievement of ultimate success, the portion of theprice which justice should assign to each as his especial produc-tion, can never be accurately ascertained. Perhaps few of thosewho have ever labored, in the patience of secrecy and silence, tobring about some political or social change, which they felt con-vinced would ultimately prove of vast service to humanity, livedto see the change effected, or the anticipated good flow from it.Fewer still of them were able to pronounce what appreciableweight their several efforts contributed to the achievement of thechange desired. Many will doubt, whether, in truth, these exer-tions have any influence whatever; and, discouraged, cease allactive effort.Not to be thus discouraged, the Mason must labor to elevateand purify his motives, as well as sedulously cherish the convic-tion, assuredly a true one, that in this world there is no such thingas effort thrown away; that in all labor there is profit; that allsincere exertion, in a righteous and unselfish cause, is necessarilyfollowed, in spite of all appearance to the contrary, by an appro-priate and proportionate success; that no bread cast upon thewaters can be wholly lost; that no seed planted in the ground canfail to quicken in due time and measure; and that, however wemay, in moments of despondency, be apt to doubt, not onlywhether our cause will triumph, but whether, if it does, we shallhave contributed to its triumph,--there is One, Who has notonly seen every exertion we have made, but Who can assignthe exact degree in which each soldier has assisted to gain thegreat victory over social evil. No good work is done wholly invain.The Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason will in nowisedeserve that honorable title, if he has not that strength, that will,that self-sustaining energy; that Faith, that feeds upon no earthlyhope, nor ever thinks of victory, but, content in its own consum-mation, combats, because it ought to combat, rejoicing fights, andstill rejoicing falls.The Augean Stables of the World, the accumulated uncleannessand misery of centuries, require a mighty river to cleanse themthoroughly away; every drop we contribute aids to swell thatriver and augment its force, in a degree appreciable by God,though not by man; and he whose zeal is deep and earnest, willnot be over-anxious that his individual drops should be distin-guishable amid the mighty mass of cleansing and fertilizingwaters; far less that, for the sake of distinction, it should flow inineffective singleness away.The true Mason will not be careful that his name should beinscribed upon the mite which he casts into the treasury of God.It suffices him to know that if he has labored, with purity of pur-pose, in any good cause, he must have contributed to its success;that the degree in which he has contributed is a matter of infi-nitely small concern; and still more, that the consciousness ofhaving so contributed, however obscurely and unnoticed, is hissufficient, even if it be his sole, reward. Let every Grand Elect,Perfect, and Sublime Mason cherish this faith. It is a duty. Itis the brilliant and never-dying light that shines within andthrough the symbolic pedestal of alabaster, on which reposes theperfect cube of agate, symbol of duty, inscribed with the divinename of God. He who industriously sows and reaps is a goodlaborer, and worthy of his hire. But he who sows that whichshall be reaped by others, by those who will know not of and carenot for the sower, is a laborer of a nobler order, and, worthy of amore excellent reward.The Mason does not exhort others to an ascetic undervaluingof this life, as an insignificant and unworthy portion of existence;for that demands feelings which are unnatural, and which, there-fore, if attained, must be morbid, and if merely professed, insin-cere; and teaches us to look rather to a future life for the com-pensation of social evils, than to this life for their cure; and sodoes injury to the cause of virtue and to that of social progress.Life is real, and is earnest, and it is full of duties to be performed.It is the beginning of our immortality. Those only who feel adeep interest and affection for this world will work resolutely forits amelioration; those whose affections are transferred to Heaven,easily acquiesce in the miseries of earth, deeming them hopeless,befitting, and ordained; and console themselves with the idea ofthe ammends which are one day to be theirs. It is a sad truth, thatthose most decidedly given to spiritual contemplation, and tomaking religion rule in their hearts, are often most apathetic to-ward all improvement of this world's systems, and in many casesvirtual conservatives of evil, and hostile to political and social re-form, as diverting men's energies from eternity.The Mason does not war with his own instincts, macerate thebody into weakness and disorder, and disparage what he sees to bebeautiful, knows to be wonderful, and feels to be unspeakablydear and fascinating. He does not put aside the nature whichGod has given him, to struggle after one which He has not be-stowed. He knows that man is sent into the world, not a spir-itual, but a composite being, made up of body and mind, the bodyhaving, as is fit and needful in a material world, its full, rightful,and allotted share. His life is guided by a full recognition of thisfact. He does not deny it in bold words, and admit it in weak-nesses and inevitable failings. He believes that his spiritualitywill come in the next stage of his being, when he puts on the spir-itual body; that his body will be dropped at death; and that, untilthen, God meant it to be commanded and controlled, but not neg-lected, despised, or ignored by the soul, under pain of heavy con-sequences. Yet the Mason is not indifferent as to the fate of the soul, afterits present life, as to its continued and eternal being, and the char-acter of the scenes in which that being will be fully developed.These are to him topics of the proroundest interest, and the mostennobling and refining contemplation. They occupy much of hisleisure; and as he becomes familiar with the sorrows and calami-ties of this life, as his hopes are disappointed and his visions ofhappiness here fade away; when life has wearied him in itsrace of hours; when he is harassed and toil-worn, and the bur-den of his years weighs heavy on him, the balance of attractiongradually inclines in favor of another life; and he clings to hislofty speculations with a tenacity of interest which needs no in-junction, and will listen to no prohibition. They are the consol-ing privilege of the aspiring, the wayworn, the weary, and thebereaved.To him the contemplation of the Future lets in light upon thePresent, and develops the higher portions of his nature. He en-deavors rightly to adjust the respective claims of Heaven andearth upon his time and thought, so as to give the proper propor-tions thereof to performing the duties and entering into the inter-ests of this world, and to preparation for a better; to the cultiva-tion and purification of his own character, and to the public serviceof his fellow-men.The Mason does not dogmatize, but entertaining and utteringhis own convictions, he leaves every one else free to do the same;and only hopes that the time will come, even if after the lapse ofages, when all men shall form one great family of brethren, andone law alone, the law of love, shall govern God's whole Uni-verse.Believe as you may, my brother; if the Universe is not, to you,without a God, and if man is not like the beast that perishes, buthath an immortal soul, we welcome you among us, to wear, as wewear, with humility, and conscious of your demerits and short-comings, the title of Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.It is not without a secret meaning, that twelve was the num-ber of the Apostles of Christ, and seventy-two that of his Dis-ciples: that John addressed his rebukes and menaces to the Sevenchurches, the number of the Archangels and the Planets. AtBabylon were the Seven Stages of Bersippa, a pyramid of Sevenstories, and at Ecbatana Seven concentric inclosures, each of adifferent color. Thebes also had Seven gates, and the same num-ber is repeated again and again in the account of the flood. TheSephiroth, or Emanations, ten in number, three in one class, andseven in the other, repeat the mystic numbers of Pythagoras.Seven Amschaspands or planetary spirits were invoked withOrmuzd: Seven inferior Rishis of Hindustan were saved with thehead of their family in an ark: and Seven ancient personagesalone returned with the British just man, Hu, from the dale ofthe grievous waters. There were Seven Heliadae, whose fatherHelias, or the Sun, once crossed the sea in a golden cup; SevenTitans, children of the older Titan, Kronos or Saturn; SevenCorybantes; and Seven Cabiri, sons of Sydyk; Seven primevalCelestial spirits of the Japanese, and Seven Karlesters whoescaped from the deluge and began to be the parents of a newrace, on the summit of Mount Albordi. Seven Cyclopes, also,built the walls of Tiryus.Celus, as quoted by Origen, tells us that the Persians repre-sented by symbols the two-fold motion of the stars, fixed andplanetary, and the passage of the Soul through their successivespheres. They erected in their holy caves, in which the mysticrites of the Mithriac Initiations were practised, what he denomi-nates a high ladder, on the Seven steps of which were Sevengates or portals, according to the number of the Seven principalheavenly bodies. Through these the aspirants passed, until theyreached the summit of the whole; and this passage was styled atransmigration through the spheres.Jacob saw in his dream a ladder planted or set on the earth,and its top reaching to Heaven, and the Malaki Alohim ascendingand descending on it, and above it stood IHUH, declaring Himselfto be Ihuh-Alhi Abraham. The word translated ladder, isSalam, from Salal, raised, elevated, reared up, exalted, piledup into a heap, Aggeravit. Salalah, means a heap, rampart,or other accumulation of earth or stone, artificially made; andSalaa or Salo, is a rock or cliff or boulder, and the name ofthe city of Petra. There is no ancient Hebrew word to designatea pyramid.The symbolic mountain Meru was ascended by Seven steps orstages; and all the pyramids and artificial tumuli and hillocksthrown up in flat countries were imitations of this fabulous andmystic mountain, for purposes of worship. These were the "HighPlaces" so often mentioned in the Hebrew books, on which theidolaters sacrificed to foreign gods.The pyramids were sometimes square, and sometimes round.The sacred Babylonian tower [Magdol], dedicated to thegreat Father Bal, was an artificial hill, of pyramidal shape, andSeven stages, built of brick, and each stage of a different color,representing the Seven planetary spheres by the appropriate colorof each planet. Meru itself was said to be a single mountain, ter-minating in three peaks, and thus a symbol of the Trimurti. Thegreat Pagoda at Tanjore was of six stories, surmounted by a tem-ple as the seventh, and on this three spires or towers. An ancientpagoda at Deogur was surmounted by a tower, sustaining themystic egg and a trident. Herodotus tells us that the Temple ofBal at Babylon was a tower composed of Seven towers, resting onan eighth that served as basis, and successively diminishing insize from the bottom to the top; and Strabo tells us it was apyramid.Faber thinks that the Mithriac ladder was really a pyramid withSeven stages, each provided with a narrow door or aperture,through each of which doors the aspirant passed, to reach thesummit, and then descended through similar doors on the oppositeside of the pyramid; the ascent and descent of the Soul beingthus represented.Each Mithriac cave and all the most ancient temples weretended to symbolize the Universe, which itself was habituallycalled the Temple and habitation of Deity. Every temple wasthe world in miniature; and so the whole world was one grandtemple. The most ancient temples were roofless; and thereforethe Persians, Celts, and Scythians strongly disliked artificial cov-ered edifices. Cicero says that Xerxes burned the Grecian tem-ples, on the express ground that the whole world was the Magnifi-cent Temple and Habitation of the Supreme Deity. Macrobiussays that the entire Universe was judiciously deemed by many theTemple of God. Plato pronounced the real Temple of the Deityto be the world; and Heraclitus declared that the Universe, varie-gated with animals and plants and stars was the only genuineTemple of the Divinity.How completely the Temple of Solomon was symbolic, ismanifest, not only from the continual reproduction in it ofthe sacred numbers and of astrological symbols in the histor-ical descriptions of it; but also, and yet more, from the de-tails of the imaginary reconstructed edifice, seen by Ezekielin his vision. The Apocalypse completes the demonstration,and shows the kabalistic meanings of the whole. The Sym-bola Architectonica are found on the most ancient edifices;and these mathematical figures and instruments, adopted bythe Templars, and identical with those on the gnostic seals andabraxae, connect their dogma with the Chaldaic, Syriac, andEgyptian Oriental philosophy. The secret Pythagorean doc-trines of numbers were preserved by the monks of Thibet, bythe Hierophants of Egypt and Eleusis, at Jerusalem, and inthe circular Chapters of the Druids; and they are especiallyconsecrated in that mysterious book, the Apocalypse of SaintJohn.All temples were surrounded by pillars, recording the numberof the constellations, the signs of the zodiac, or the cycles of theplanets; and each one was a microcosm or symbol of the Universe,having for roof or ceiling the starred vault of Heaven.All temples were originally open at the top, having for roof thesky. Twelve pillars described the belt of the zodiac. Whateverthe number of the pillars, they were mystical everywhere. AtAbury, the Druidic temple reproduced all the cycles by its col-umns. Around the temples of Chilminar in Persia, of Baalbec,and of Tukhti Schlomoh in Tartary, on the frontier of China,stood forty pillars. On each side of the temple at Paestum werefourteen, recording the Egyptian cycle of the dark and light sidesof the moon, as described by Plutarch; the whole thirty-eightthat surrounded them recording the two meteoric cycles so oftenfound in the Druidic temples.The theatre built by Scaurus, in Greece, was surrounded by360 columns; the Temple at Mecca, and that at Iona in Scotland,by 360 stones.
