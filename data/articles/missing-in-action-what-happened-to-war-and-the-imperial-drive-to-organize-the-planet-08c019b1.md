There is, it seems, something new under the sun.
Geopolitically speaking, when it comes to war
and the imperial principle, we may be in uncharted territory. Take a look
around and youll see a world at the boiling point.
From,
-
Ukraine to Syria
-
South Sudan to Thailand
-
Libya to Bosnia
-
Turkey to Venezuela,
...citizen protest (left and right) is
sparking not just disorganization, but what looks like, to coin a word,
de-organization at a global level.
Increasingly, the unitary status of states,
large and small, old and new, is being called into question. Civil war,
violence, and internecine struggles of various sorts are visibly on the
rise.
In many cases, outside countries are involved
and yet in each instance state power seems to be
draining away
to no other states gain.
So heres one question:
Where exactly is power located on this
planet of ours right now?
There is, of course, a single waning superpower
that has in this new century sent its military into action globally,
aggressively, repeatedly - and disastrously.
And yet these actions have failed to reinforce
the imperial system of organizing and
garrisoning the planet that it put in place at the end of World War II;
nor has it proven capable of organizing a new global system for a new
century. In fact, everywhere its touched militarily, local and regional
chaos have followed.
In the meantime, its own political system has
grown gargantuan and unwieldy; its
electoral process has been
overwhelmed by vast flows of money from the
wealthy 1%; and its governing system is visibly troubled, if not
dysfunctional.
Its rich are
ever richer, its poor
ever poorer, and its middle class
in decline. Its military, the largest by
many multiples on the planet, is nonetheless beginning to
cut back.
Around the world, allies,
client states, and enemies are paying ever
less attention to its wishes and desires, often without serious penalty.
It has the classic look of a great power in
decline and in another moment it might be easy enough to predict that,
though far wealthier than its Cold War superpower adversary, it has simply
been heading for the graveyard more slowly but no less surely.
Such a prediction would, however, be unwise.
Never since the modern era began has a waning power so lacked serious
competition or been essentially without enemies.
Whether in decline or not, the United States -
these days being hailed as "the
new Saudi Arabia" in terms of its frackable energy wealth - is visibly
in no danger of losing its status as the planets only imperial power.
-
What, then, of power itself?
-
Are we still in some strange way - to
bring back the long forgotten Bush-era phrase - in a unipolar
moment?
-
Or is power, as it was briefly
fashionable to say, increasingly multipolar?
-
Or is it helter-skelter-polar?
-
Or on a planet whose temperatures are
rising, droughts growing more severe, and future food prices
threatening to soar (meaning yet more protest, violence, and
disruption), are there even "poles" any more?
Here, in any case, is a reality of the initial
13 years of the twenty-first century:
for the first time in at least a half
a millennium, the imperial principle seems to be ebbing, and yet the only
imperial power, increasingly incapable of organizing the world, isnt going
down.
If you survey our planet, the situation is
remarkably unsettled and confusing.
But at least two things stand out, and whatever
you make of them, they could be the real news of the first decades of this
century. Both are right before our eyes, yet largely unseen.
-
First, the imperial principle and the great
power competition to which it has been wedded are on the wane.
-
Second and
no less startling,
war (global, intrastate, anti-insurgent), which convulsed
the twentieth century, seems to be waning as well.
What in the world does it all mean?
A Scarcity of Great
Powers
Lets start with the imperial part of the
equation.
From the moment the Europeans dispatched their
cannon-bearing wooden ships on a violent exploration and conquest of the
globe, there has never been a moment when one or more empires werent rising
as others waned, or when at least two and sometimes several "great powers"
werent competing for ways to divide the planetary spoils and organize,
encroach upon, or take over spheres of influence.
In the wake of World War II, with the British
Empire essentially penniless and the German, Japanese, and Italian versions
of empire crushed, only two great powers were left. They more or less
divided the planet unequally between them.
Of the two, the United States was significantly
wealthier and more powerful.
In 1991, after a nearly half-century-long Cold
War in which those superpowers
at least once came to the edge of a nuclear exchange, and blood was
spilled in copious amounts on "the peripheries" in "limited war, the last
of the conflicts of that era - in Afghanistan - helped take down the Soviet
Union.
When its army limped home from what its leader
referred to as "the bleeding wound" and its economy imploded, the USSR
unexpectedly - and surprisingly peacefully - disappeared.
Which, of course, left one. The superest of all
powers of any time - or so many in Washington came to believe. There had
never, they were convinced, been anything like it.
One hyperpower, one planet: that was to be the
formula.
Talk of a "peace dividend" disappeared quickly enough and, with
the U.S. military financially and technologically dominant and no longer
worried about a war that might quite literally end all wars, a new era
seemed to begin.
There had, of course, been an ongoing "arms
race" between great powers since at least the end of the nineteenth
century. Now, at a moment when it should logically have been over, the U.S.
instead launched an arms race of one to ensure that no other military would
ever be capable of challenging its forces.
(Who knew then that those same forces would be
laid low by ragtag crews of insurgents with small arms, homemade roadside
bombs, and their own bodies as their weapons?)
As the new century dawned, a crew led by
George
W. Bush and
Dick Cheney ascended to power in Washington. They were the
first administration ever
largely born of a think tank (with the ambitious name
Project for a New American Century).
Long before
9/11 gave them their opportunity to
set the American military loose on the planet, they were
already dreaming of an all-American imperium that would
outshine the British or Roman empires.
Of course, who doesnt know what happened next?
Though they imagined organizing a Pax
Americana in the Middle East and then on a planetary scale, theirs
didnt turn out to be an organizational vision at all.
-
They got bogged down
in Afghanistan, destabilizing neighboring Pakistan.
-
They got bogged down in
Iraq, having punched a hole through the heart of the planet's oil heartlands
and set off a Sunni-Shiite regional civil war, whose
casualty lists continue to
stagger the imagination.
In the process, they never came close to their
dream of bringing Tehran to its knees, no less establishing even the most
rudimentary version of that Pax Americana.
They were an imperial whirlwind, but every move
they made proved disastrous. In effect, they lent a hand to the de-imperialization
of the planet.
By the time they were done and
the Obama years
were upon us,
-
Latin America was no longer an American
"backyard
-
much of the Middle East was a basketcase
(but not an American one)
-
Africa, into which Washington
continues to move military forces, was beginning to destabilize
-
Europe, for the first time since the era
of French President Charles de Gaulle, seemed ready to say "no" to
American wishes (and was
angry as hell)
And yet power, seeping out of the American
system, seemed to be coagulating nowhere.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has played a
remarkably clever hand. From his role in
brokering a Syrian deal with Washington to the hosting of the Olympics
and a
winning medal count in Sochi, hes given his country the look of a great
power.
In reality, however, it remains a relatively
ramshackle state, a vestige of the Soviet era still, as in Ukraine, fighting
a rearguard action against history (and the inheritors of the Cold War
mantle, the U.S. and the European Union).
The EU is an economic powerhouse, but in
austerity-gripped disarray. While distinctly a great economic force, it is
not in any functional sense a great power.
China is certainly the enemy of choice both for
Washington and the
American public. And it is visibly a rising power, which has been
putting
ever more money into building a regional
military.
Still, it isnt fighting and its economic and
environmental problems are staggering enough, along with its
food and
energy needs, that any future imperial
destiny seems elusive at best.
Its leadership, while
more bullish in the Pacific, is clearly in no mood to take on imperial
tasks. (Japan is similarly an economic power with a
chip on its shoulder, putting money into creating a
more expansive military, but an actual imperial repeat performance seems
beyond unlikely.)
There was a time when it was believed that as a
group the so-called
BRICS countries,
-
Brazil
-
Russia
-
India
-
China
-
South Africa
-
(and some added Turkey),
...would be the collective powerhouse of
a future multi-polar planet.
But that was before the,
...economies stopped looking so rosy.
In the end, the U.S. aside, great powers remain
scarcer than hens teeth.
War - Missing in Action
Now, lets move on to an even more striking and
largely unremarked upon characteristic of these years.
If you take one
country - or possibly two - out of the mix, war between states or between
major powers and insurgencies has largely ceased to exist.
Admittedly, every rule has its exceptions and
from full-scale colonial-style wars (Iraq, Afghanistan) to small-scale
conflicts mainly involving drones or air power (Yemen, Somalia, Libya), the
United States has seemingly made traditional war its own in the early years
of this century.
Nonetheless, the Iraq war ended
ignominiously in 2011 and the Afghan War seems to be limping to
something close to an end in a
slow-motion withdrawal this year.
In addition, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel
has
just announced the Pentagons intention to cut its boots-on-the-ground
contingent significantly in the years to come, a sign that future conflicts
are far less likely to involve full-scale invasions and occupations on the
Eurasian land mass.
Possible exception number two: Israel launched a
34-day war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006 and a significant
three-week
military incursion into the Gaza Strip in 2008-2009 (though none of this
added up to anything like the wars that country fought in the previous
century).
Otherwise when it comes to war - that is, to
sending armies across national boundaries or, in nineteenth-century style,
to distant lands to conquer and "pacify" - were left with almost nothing.
Its true that the last war of the previous
century between Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea
straggled six months into this one. There was as well the 2008 Russian
incursion into Georgia (a straggler from the unraveling of the Soviet
Union). Dubbed the "five-day
war, it proved a minor affair (if you didnt happen to be Georgian).
There was also a dismal
U.S.-supported Ethiopian invasion of Somalia in 2006 (and a
Kenyan
invasion of that mess of a country but not exactly state in
2011).
As for more traditional imperial-style wars, you
can count them on one hand, possibly one finger: the 2013
French intervention in Mali (after a disastrous U.S./NATO air-powered
intervention in Libya
destabilized that neighboring country).
France has also sent its troops elsewhere in
Africa, most recently into the Central African Republic, but these were at
best micro-versions of nineteenth century colonial wars.
Turkey has from
time to time
struck across its border into Iraq as part of an internal conflict with
its Kurdish population.
In Asia, other than
rising tensions and a couple of ships
almost bumping on the high seas, the closest you can get to war in this
century was a
minor border clash in April 2001 between India and Bangladesh.
Now, the above might look like a sizeable enough
list until you consider the record for the second half of the twentieth
century in Asia alone:
-
the Korean War (1950-1953)
-
a month-long
border war between China and India in 1962
-
the French and American wars in Vietnam
(1946-1975)
-
the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in
1978
-
Chinas invasion of Vietnam in 1979
-
Indian-Pakistani wars in 1965, 1971, and
1999
(The Bangladeshi war of independence in 1971 was
essentially a civil war.)
And that, of course, leaves out the carnage of
the first 50 years of a century that began with a foreign intervention in
the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 and
ended with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
In fact, judged by almost any standard from just
about any period in the previous two centuries, war is now missing in
action, which is indeed something new under the sun.
Driving With the Lights
Off
So an imperial era is on the wane, war in
absentia, and no rising great power contenders on the horizon. Historically
speaking, thats a remarkable scorecard in an otherwise appalling world.
Of course, the lack of old-style war hardly
means no violence.
In the 13 years of this new century, the
scorecard on internal strife and civil war, often with external involvement,
has been awful to behold:
-
Yemen (with the involvement of the
Saudis and the Americans)
-
Syria (with the involvement of the
Russians, the Saudis, the Qataris, the Iranians, Hezbollah, the
Iraqis, the Turks, and the Americans),
...and so on.
The record, including,
-
the Congo (numerous
outside parties)
-
South Sudan
-
Darfur
-
India (a Maoist insurgency)
-
Nigeria
(Islamic extremists),
...and so on, couldnt be grimmer.
Moreover, 13 years at the beginning of a century
is a rather small sampling. Just think of 1914 and the great war that
followed.
Before the present Ukrainian crisis is over, for instance,
Russian troops could again
cross a border in force (as in 2008) along the still fraying edges of
the former Soviet Union.
Its also possible (though
developments seem to be leading in quite a different direction) that
either the Israelis or the Americans could
still launch an attack on Iran's nuclear
facilities, increasing the chaos and violence in the Middle East.
Similarly, an incident in the edgy Pacific might
trigger an unexpected conflict between Japan and China. (Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe recently
compared this moment in Asia to the eve of World War I in Europe and his
country and China to England and Germany.) And of course there are the
"resource wars" expected on an increasingly devastated planet.
Still, for the moment no rising empire and no
states fighting each other.
So who knows? Maybe we are off the beaten path
of history and in terra incognita. Perhaps this is a road weve never
been down before, an actual
new
world order.
If so, were driving it with our headlights off,
the wind whipping up, and the rain pouring down on a planet that may itself,
in climate terms, be heading for uncharted territory.
