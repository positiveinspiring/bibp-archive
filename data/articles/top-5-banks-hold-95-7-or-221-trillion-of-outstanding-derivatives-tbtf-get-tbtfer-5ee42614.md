Every quarter the Office of the Currency Comptroller (OCC) releases its report on
Bank Derivative Activities, and every quarter we find that the Too Big To
Fail get Too Bigger To Fail.
To wit: in Q4 2011, of the total $230.8 trillion
in US outstanding derivatives, the Top 5 banks,
...accounted for 95.7% of all
Derivatives.
In some respects
this is good news:
in Q2, the Top 5 banks held 95.9% of the
$250 trillion in
derivatives.
Unfortunately it is also bad news, because $220 trillion is
more than enough for the world to collapse in a daisy chained failure of
bilateral netting (which not even all the central banks in the world can
offset).
What is the worst news, is that the just
released report indicates that in addition to everything else, we have now
hit peak delusion, as banks now report to the OCC that a record high 92.2%
of gross credit exposure is "bilaterally netted."
While we won't spend much time on this issue
now, it is safe to say that bilateral netting is the biggest lie in modern
finance (read
How US Banks Are Lying About Their European Exposure; Or How
Bilateral Netting Ends With A Bang, Not A Whimper for an explanation of this
fraud which was exposed completely in the AIG collapse).
And just to put this in global perspective,
according to
the BIS in the first half of 2011, global derivative gross
exposure increased by $107 trillion to a record $707 trillion.
It will be quite interesting to get the full
year report to see if this acceleration in gross exposure has increased.
Because if it has, we will now know that in 2011 European banks were forced
up to load up on several hundred trillion in mostly interest rate swap
exposure. Which can only mean one thing: when and if central banks lose
control of government bond curves, an rates start moving wider again, the
global margin call will be unprecedented.
Until then we can just delude ourselves that
central planners have everything under control, have everything under
control, have everything under control...
Top 5 bank derivative exposure:
Exposure by bank:
And the delusion that everyone is somehow
hedged.
To the tune of $230 trillion!
