Bill Gates Applauds Thailand's
Demographic Suicide
With smashing timing, Bill and Melinda Gates
released
a missive in the Wall Street Journal about
the three myths on the world's poor coinciding with
a report announcing that the top richest 85
people (a list they are solidly on) in the world have more money than the
poorest 3.5 billion or 50% of the entire world's population.
This is an insane wealth gap. These people and
their bajillions are essentially running the world.
In the third myth of their response, the Gates'
commend Thailand as a great example of family planning because Thai women
went from having an average of six children per woman just a few decades ago
to having an average of 1.6 children today.
There's just one problem. Replacement rate -
that is the number of children needed to maintain a stable population - is
2.1 (but it's even higher for countries with higher mortality rates).
That means that Thailand is below replacement
rate, a reality that is screwing up the country's social and economic
foundations.
It's so bad in Thailand, actually, that
articles have detailed the "aging crisis"
the country now faces due to the low birth rate. In fact, all the Asian
nations are now facing this issue, and most of the developed world is below
replacement rate as well.
Leave it to
Bill Gates, billionaire eugenicist
extraordinaire, to applaud a country for committing demographic suicide.

Population Control - A Centuries Old
Agenda Driven by 'Philanthropic' Dollars
For just over a century, since its formation in
1913, the Rockefeller Foundation and other organizations created by
the Rockefeller Dynasty have steered
the direction of global attitudes towards population, birth control and
eugenics.
Elite money from the East Coast of America
joined with the aristocratically-inclined scientific crowd from Britain to
create an organized attempt to
establish Eugenics as a mindset
that enabled elite control, and gave a rationale for reigning in
the procreation of those declared unfit.
Leading industrial magnates threw the weight of
their wealth behind the fields of social work, genetics, medicine, public
health agencies and politics to establish new offices, new organization and
new laws to enforce Eugenics - declaring the unfit stripped of their right
to breed, while glorifying the reproduction of best as progressors of
the race of the world state.
The Rockefellers were leaders in this area,
using their foundation to pursue Eugenics in university research and attempt
to engineer a new Man' by controlling the science of life and establishing
a tyranny over the reproductive cycle.
Privately the Rockefellers funded Margaret
Sanger, founder of the organization that became
Planned Parenthood and who stirred
controversy in Congressional testimony for breaking laws by promoting birth
control.
It also funded extreme eugenicists like Paul
Popenoe in America and the
Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Nazi Germany, set
up explicitly to
study eugenics under
individuals like the notorious Josef Mengele.
After WWII and the stain of the Nazis, the
Rockefellers helped Eugenics shed its dark associations and re-brand under
cause like "Family Planning & Worldwide Planned Parenthood" through
organizations which most notably include
John
D. Rockefeller III's Population Council.
Rockefeller money paid for lots of propaganda
and instituted involuntary sterilization programs in Puerto Rico, Brazil and
California, among many other locales.
National Family Planning ministries in India,
China, Peru and elsewhere have enforced compulsory sterilization and/or
birth limits with often dictatorial and genocidal population control
methods.
Family planning programs were pushed on most of
the developing nations of the world, with special emphasis on the top
countries with the largest population growth - which was echoed in State
Department and National Security policy through
Henry
Kissinger's 1974
NSSM
#200 memo which identified population as a major threat to
national security and recommended the
use of "food as a weapon"
in order to curb populations.
In later years, the Rockefeller Foundation
funded the development of genetically engineered edible contraceptive
plants, such as through the work of
Charles Arntzen (and with eerie
parallels through the
Epicyte episode).
The Rockefeller Foundation also quietly funded
an anti-fertility in
the HcG vaccine which was used covertly
with the widely distributed tetanus vaccine, which served as a carrier to
trigger autoimmune
response to HcG and trigger spontaneous
abortion and infertility.
Scientific studies have demonstrated the
undisclosed use of this HcG infertility vaccine in the Phillipines and
Thailand.
All this way done as Rockefeller dollars also
heavy funded the medical industry and pushed the use of vaccines worldwide.
More recently, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation became the foremost
player in philanthropy and formed multiple alliances with the Rockefeller
Foundation, agreeing to use its funds to pursue their goals.
This can been seen in,
...among others,
pushing vaccines and
GMO crops on the developing and developed
world alike.
Since that time, Gates and Rockefeller have
taken things a step further, organizing a Bilderberg-style secret meeting
among billionaire philanthropists to coordinate the agenda for population
control efforts and other leading issues. It was covered in the media in
glowing light, portraying these billionaire control freaks as literal
superheroes and saviors of the planet.'
Aaron Dykes previously covered how grant
money from the
Gates Foundation inadvertently pays for good press.
Here's just a few examples of slanted
coverage in the
London Guardian's 2009 article on the so-called "Good Club."
-
"Few doubt the good intentions of Gates
and Winfrey and their kind. They have already improved the lives of
millions of poor people across the developing world. But can the
richest people on earth actually save the planet?"
-
"Sources say Gates was the most
impressive speaker, while Turner was the most outspoken."
-
"There is little doubt that members of
the Good Club have done amazing work."
-
"The Soros Foundation has done valuable
work setting up democratic institutions and independent media across
the former Soviet bloc."
[Editor's Note:
Soros's
actions here are less philanthropy and
more, arguably, tantamount to covert regime change in tandem with U.S.
policy objectives]
These types of praiseworthy propaganda lines are
rampant, custom design to laud billionaires like Gates and Rockefeller,
while lifting them up on a pedestal that projects their importance and
appears to lend credence to their self-appointed and assumed seat at the
helm of the world ship - in their decidedly undemocratic ways.
The Guardian did manage to carry some criticism
of the "Good Club."
Paul Harris
wrote:
"The existence of the Good Club has struck
many as a two-edged sword.
On one hand, they represent a new golden age
of philanthropy, harking back to the early 20th century when the likes
of Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Carnegie became famous for their good
works.
Yet the reach and power of the Good Club are
truly new. Its members control vast wealth - and with that wealth comes
huge power that could reshape nations according to their will."
[...]
"There is also the issue of accountability.
Even the most repressive of national governments is on some level
beholden to its own people, or has the capacity to change and reform
under popular pressure. But who votes for the Good Club?"
No one. That's the point.
These are a tiny class of people that have
appointed themselves to fix the problems of the world - in their own ways.
The same wealth disparity that has made the
world's 85 richest worth more than half of the entire global population has
given them big enough heads to think they can call the shots.
And who will stop them? Who will even point out
the harm, rather than just assume they are saints and thank their unilateral
actions?
