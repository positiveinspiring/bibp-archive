Polluted drinking water is a significant
health threat that is sorely underreported and oft-ignored.
A recent article in the
Star Tribune
1 highlights the very real
struggle to access clean drinking water right here in the United States.
"Debbie
Carlson can laugh at the irony: She's the wife of a well digger who
can't find good water for his own family. Like one out of three wells in
Dakota County, hers is so contaminated with nitrates she won't let
anyone drink from it -- especially her 8-year-old granddaughter.
Most
likely it comes from nitrogen used as fertilizer on the cornfields
surrounding her home," Josephine Marcotty
writes.2
"'Nitrogen was a great thing for the family farm,' Carlson said. 'But I
am paying the price.'"
Minnesota Facing Growing Water
Contamination Problem
In part due to the fact that Minnesota is prime
farm land, many of the state's inhabitants now face the problem of having
elevated levels of nitrogen in their drinking water.
The conversion of grasslands and pastures into
chemical-driven, industrial crop land has eliminated much of the natural
filtering of ground water that such native landscapes typically provide.
The areas worst affected include:
Besides the health risks - which include a
potential connection to cancer, as well as thyroid and reproductive problems
in both humans and livestock - groundwater contaminated by nitrogen is also
a huge financial drain for affected communities.
According to the featured article, about a dozen
Minnesota communities so far have spent millions of dollars to clean
nitrogen from their water supplies. However, well owners, such as the
Carlson's, are on their own.
Their only alternatives are to pay to dig a new, deeper well, or install
their own treatment system.
At present, an estimated six percent of private
wells are contaminated with nitrogen; this despite the fact that farmers
have actually cut their use of the fertilizer quite dramatically.
"Now, through
an emerging statewide strategy, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture
is devising a range of fixes, including more water monitoring and
guidance on how communities can restore some of the lost prairie
landscape.
In the
process, officials and farmers will tackle two thorny questions: How
will government use its power to regulate nitrogen use in contaminated
areas? And even if every landowner follows the best guidance science can
provide, when will they know if it works?
Striking the
right balance is crucial because the current approach, said Jill
Trescott, Dakota County's groundwater-protection supervisor, imposes a
cost shift from agriculture to taxpayers and homeowners that is 'just
not fair.'
Says Carlson:
'I think water is one of our most precious
resources. What are our grandchildren going to be left with?'"
Is Your Water Safe to Drink?
Unless you are getting your water from a well
that is located 800 feet or more below the ground surface, chances are your
well water has been contaminated by some, if not many, toxic substances that
have been dumped into the ground soil over past decades.
Besides fertilizers like nitrogen, other common
toxins that are dumped by the millions of pounds into soil every year are:
Many private wells in the United States have
been affected by these types of chemical or heavy metal runoff from the
surrounding ground soil, and this is to say nothing of the microorganisms
living in well water as well.
No matter how clean or pure your natural ground
water looks, this has nothing to do with potential bacterial contamination
or toxic pollution in the water. Many of the offenders in well water are
just much too small to be seen with the naked eye.
So, if your home uses well water, you really
need to test to see what unwanted contaminants you're piping into your
house, and then filter it accordingly.
If you get municipal water, you should
have that tested too.
There are more than 140 chemicals in U.S.
drinking water supplies that are not regulated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).3
This includes gasoline, pesticides, rocket fuel,
prescription drugs and more. More than 20 percent of U.S. water treatment
systems
violated key provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act between 2004 and
2009 alone.
Since 2004, the water provided to more than 49
million people has contained illegal concentrations of chemicals like
arsenic or radioactive substances like uranium, as well as dangerous
bacteria often found in sewage.
Fracking - Another Threat to
Fresh Water Reserves
Industrial agriculture is not the only
threat to our drinking water.
Hydraulic fracturing, the method used to drill
for natural gas, also known as "fracking," is becoming yet another major
source of groundwater contamination. The documentary
'Gasland' shed much needed light on the
environmental destructiveness of the method:
Promised
Land, a Hollywood production featuring actor Matt Damon premiered on
December 28, 2012.
According to Reuters:4
"In the film,
Damon plays a gas company landman - an agent who buys or leases land -
intent on drilling beneath a town where some residents are concerned
about the perils of fracking. As the landman gets to know the
townspeople, he suffers a crisis of conscience.
...[B]oth
industry and anti-fracking camps have mounted major campaigns to sway
hearts and minds.
'It could become the biggest environmental debate of
our time,' said Robert McNally, an energy policy expert and former White
House adviser under
George W. Bush.
'Hollywood is taking notice, and the
industry will have its work cut out for it to defend fracking.'
Nearly four
out of ten Americans surveyed by the Pew Research Center early this year
said they knew nothing about fracking. Other polls show most Americans
familiar with the practice believe fracking offers economic benefits but
requires tougher regulation.
This year, for the first time, U.S. online
searches for the term 'fracking' became more popular than 'climate
change,' Google data showed."
The primary concern over fracking is its
environmental impact, particularly its potential to render water supplies
undrinkable.
The method entails pumping chemical-laced water
and sand at high pressure into shale rock formation, thereby releasing
hydrocarbons. The chemicals used in the process have the potential to leak
into nearby groundwater, either from the well, or from spills above ground.
Yet another concern is fracking-induced
earthquakes.
According to Reuters, several drillers have been
fined for water contamination due to spilled fracking fluids, and in 2011,
the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released findings of a
potential link between fracking and water contamination after sampling water
supplies in Pavillion, Wyoming.
The EPA is scheduled to release an in-depth
study on fracking's impact on water supplies in 2014.
Fresh Water Reserves Depleted by
Agricultural Irrigation
Besides contamination, fresh water
reserves are also being outright depleted by agricultural irrigation.
An article in
Harper's Magazine 5
published last summer highlighted the rapid depletion of the
Ogallala
Aquifer - the largest subterranean water supply in the United States.
"Until the
Second World War, the Ogallala went almost entirely untapped...
It
wasn't until the 1940s, when a variety of new technologies coalesced on
the plains, that large-scale irrigation sprang up for the first time -
but from there, the transformation was quick. Within a decade thousands
of wells were drilled, creating a spike in productivity as unprecedented
as it was unsustainable...
Even as the
U.S. population surged, with soldiers returning and babies booming, the
output of the plains rose fast enough to meet and exceed demand. No one
worried about the aquifer.
To farmers it
seemed a bottomless reserve, generating the same outlandish volume no
matter how many straws went in. Soon there were hundreds of thousands of
wells producing the same reliable flow, year after year, without any
evident stress.
Then, during
the early 1990s, farmers throughout the Great Plains began to notice a
decline in their wells. Irrigation systems from the Dakotas to Texas
dipped, and, in some places, have been abandoned entirely."
According to Kevin Mulligan, a professor
at Texas Tech University who leads the effort to monitor the Ogallala,
available water in the aquifer has gone down by about 80-100 feet in just
the past 15 years, and none of the water is likely to be replenished.
A mere 20 years from now, it's unlikely that any
irrigated agriculture will be possible on the high plains - the water will
be all gone...
Then what?
Genetically Engineered Crops
Compound These Problems
Industrial monoculture farming practices as a
whole pose a tremendous threat to water supplies, in multiple ways, whether
through contamination or by depleting what little fresh water is available.
And far from being a solution,
genetically
engineered (GE) crops make matters even worse, as they end up needing more
agricultural chemicals than other crops, and typically require more water...
India is an agrarian country, populated by 1.1
billion people, about 60 percent of whom are directly or indirectly
dependent on agriculture. With the introduction of genetically engineered
crops, Indian farmers have taken to suicide at alarming rates due to the
failure of such crops.
There are four primary factors directly related
to the use of genetically engineered seed that contribute heavily to this
grim situation:
-
Limited water supplies and
poor access to irrigation, combined with periodic drought and
decreased monsoonal rainfall regularly cause GE crops to fail
-
Compared to traditional seed, GE seeds
are very expensive and have to be repurchased every planting season
-
Genetically engineered crops also
have much higher requirements for fertilizer and pesticide (in spite
of Monsanto's claims to the contrary) and, in spite of their cost to
farmers, provide
NO increased yield
What's the Best Option for Safe,
Pure Water?
There's no doubt about it:
Safe, pure water is
becoming increasingly difficult to come by, even in otherwise affluent,
developed nations.
For most people, regardless of where you live, purifying
the water you drink is more a necessity than a choice.
By this I do NOT mean resorting to bottled water
from your supermarket. Bottled water is typically nothing more than bottled
tap water that may or may not have received additional filtration, and the
federal testing requirements for bottled water are actually more lax than
those for communal water supplies.
One of the best alternatives to the tap may be
finding a gravity-fed raw spring in your area - barring contamination from
nearby agriculture, that is. Fortunately, natural springs are often
monitored by the local municipalities for contaminants.
Natural spring water is naturally filtered by
the earth and is "living water," in the same way that raw food is "living
food," which is why it's some of the most healthful water on the planet.
Before you dismiss this idea because you think there are no such springs in
your neck of the woods, there is a Web site called
FindaSpring.com that can help you locate springs in your area.
The next best option is to filter the water that
comes out of your tap, but there are benefits and drawbacks to virtually
every water filtration system on the market.
Currently, I use a whole house
carbon-based water filtration system. Prior to this I used reverse osmosis
(RO) to purify my water. This
previous article can help you make a decision about what type of water
filtration system will be best for you and your family.
Since most
water sources are now severely polluted, the issue of water filtration
and purification couldn't be more important.
Keep Fighting for Labeling of
Genetically Engineered Foods
While California Prop. 37 failed to pass last
November, by a very narrow margin, the fight for GMO labeling is far from
over.
The field-of-play has now moved to the state of
Washington, where the people's initiative 522, "The People's Right to Know
Genetically Engineered Food Act," will require food sold in retail outlets
to be labeled if it contains genetically engineered ingredients.
As stated on LabelitWA.org:
"Calorie and
nutritional information were not always required on food labels.
But
since 1990 it has been required and most consumers use this information
every day. Country-of-origin labeling wasn't required until 2002. The
trans fat content of foods didn't have to be labeled until 2006. Now,
all of these labeling requirements are accepted as important for
consumers.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also says we must know
with labeling if our orange juice is from fresh oranges or frozen
concentrate.
Doesn't it
make sense that genetically engineered foods containing experimental
viral, bacterial, insect, plant or animal genes should be labeled, too?
Genetically engineered foods do not have to be tested for safety before
entering the market.
No long-term human feeding studies have been done.
The research we have is raising serious questions about the impact to
human health and the environment.
I-522
provides the transparency people deserve. I-522 will not raise costs to
consumers or food producers. It simply would add more information to
food labels, which manufacturers change routinely anyway, all the time.
I-522 does not impose any significant cost on our state. It does not
require the state to conduct label surveillance, or to initiate or
pursue enforcement.
The state may choose to do so, as a policy choice,
but I-522 was written to avoid raising costs to the state or consumers."
Remember, as with
CA Prop. 37, they need support
of people like YOU to succeed.
Prop. 37 failed with a very narrow margin simply
because we didn't have the funds to counter the massive ad campaigns created
by the No on 37 camp,
led by Monsanto and other major food companies.
Let's
not allow Monsanto and its allies to confuse and mislead the people of
Washington and Vermont as they did in California.
So please, I urge you to get involved and help
in any way you can, regardless of what state you live in.
-
No matter where you live in the United
States, please donate money to these labeling efforts through the
Organic Consumers Fund.
-
If you live in Washington State, please
sign the I-522 petition. You can also
volunteer to help gather signatures across the state.
-
For timely updates on issues relating to
these and other labeling initiatives, please join the Organic
Consumers Association on
Facebook, or follow them on
Twitter.
-
Talk to organic producers and stores and
ask them to actively support the Washington initiative.
