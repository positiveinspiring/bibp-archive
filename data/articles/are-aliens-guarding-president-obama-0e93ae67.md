A video recording from President Obama's address
at the 2012
AIPAC conference at the Washington Convention Center shows a
mysterious looking figure among the
Secret Service agents protecting him.
From one camera angle, the figure looks
uncannily like a tall Gray alien; with no noticeable ear, mouth or facial
hair. From most other camera angles, the figure appears as a bald Secret
Service agent who looks human enough. Not so according to a popular YouTube
BELOW video that has over 330,000 hits since its March 13, 2013 release.
The bald Secret Service agent is a shape
shifting humanoid alien, and the video provides detailed analysis supporting
its remarkable claim.
So was it all just a trick a light, or did the
camera capture something we werent supposed to see?
In the 1988 science fiction movie classic,
They Live, extraterrestrials live among humanity using advanced
technology to hide their physical differences. Is it possible that the
Secret Service employs aliens to protect President Obama, and uses some kind
of advanced technology to hide them from the public eye?
The idea of the U.S. Secret Service employing
aliens appears far-fetched, but it was only back on December 7, 2012 that
Prime Minister Medvedev said in candid off-air comments that Russian
Presidents are briefed on aliens living among us.
He went on to add that a highly classified
national security agency monitors aliens residing on Earth. Major media
thought it was a case of Medvedevs dry humor, and that he
gave the joke away when he referred to the Hollywood Blockbuster,
Men in Black.
Yet Medvedev appeared to be referring to
a Russian documentary instead, one produced by the same network that the
female reporter who asked him the alien question worked for.
In fact, the reporter asked the question because
the network was working on another extraterrestrial related documentary. A
disturbing possibility is that the meteor strike on Russia on February 15,
2013 was related to Medevedevs candid off-air comments about aliens among
us.
A
Russian Parliamentarian claimed that the meteor strike was a warning to
the Russian government. Was it a warning that Russian needs to maintain
secrecy about alien visitors?
If Medvedev wasnt joking, it is possible that
aliens secretly living on Earth arent just monitored, but also employed in
sensitive security positions like the U.S. Secret Service.
Its a fact that advanced technologies such as
invisibility have been developed for use in classified military projects for
some time now.
Proof-of-concept demonstrations in the open source literature are
available for funding and development purposes by military contractors.
Classified versions would predictably be far more advanced, and very likely
have been operational for some time now.
Its reasonable to conclude that invisibility or
related technologies are used by the Secret Service to make agents
disappear, and/or alter their physical appearance. Consequently, Secret
Service agents very likely use invisibility technology when protecting the
President and other VIPs.
Such technologies may also be used by any
extraterrestrial aliens recruited into the Secret Service. Is President
Obama being guarded by aliens, or was it all just a trick of light?
You decide!
