Throughout history, in most cases of economic collapse the societies in question believed they were financially invincible just before their disastrous fall.
Rarely does anyone see the edge of the cliff or even the bottom of the abyss before it has swallowed a nation whole. This lack of foresight, however, is not entirely the fault of the public.
It is, rather, a consequence caused by the manipulation of the fundamental information available to the public by governments and social gatekeepers.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, numerous mainstream "experts" and politicians were quick to discount the idea of economic collapse, and most people were more than ready to believe them. Equities markets were, of course, the primary tool used to falsely elicit popular optimism.
When markets rose, even in spite of other very negative fiscal indicators, the masses were satisfied.
In this way, stock markets have become a kind of dopamine switch financial elites can push at any given time to juice the citizenry and distract them from the greater perils of their economic future. During every upswing of stocks, the elites argued that the "corner had been turned," when in reality the crisis had just begun.
Nothing has changed since the crash of 1929.
Just look at some of these quotes and decide if the rhetoric sounds familiar today:
John Maynard Keynes in 1927: "We will not have any more crashes in our time." H.H. Simmons, president of the New York Stock Exchange, Jan. 12, 1928: "I cannot help but raise a dissenting voice to statements that we are living in a fool's paradise, and that prosperity in this country must necessarily diminish and recede in the near future." Irving Fisher, leading U.S. economist, The New York Times, Sept. 5, 1929: "There may be a recession in stock prices, but not anything in the nature of a crash." And on 17 Sept. 1929: "Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. I do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels, such as (bears) have predicted. I expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months." W. McNeel, market analyst, as quoted in the New York Herald Tribune, Oct. 30, 1929: "This is the time to buy stocks. This is the time to recall the words of the late J. P. Morgan that any man who is bearish on America will go broke. Within a few days there is likely to be a bear panic rather than a bull panic. Many of the low prices as a result of this hysterical selling are not likely to be reached again in many years." Harvard Economic Society, Nov. 10, 1929: " a serious depression seems improbable; [we expect] recovery of business next spring, with further improvement in the fall."

I hear nearly identical statements from pro-mainstream, pro-dollar skeptics all the time.
And all of their assertions rest solely on the illusion of the Dow and the dollar index, not to mention statistics that are sourced from the very government that has much to gain by fooling the public into believing all is well.
In 2009, Paul Krugman, perhaps the worst and most famous economist of our age, lamented on the fact that no one in mainstream finance saw the derivatives and credit crash coming. Yet it is the same kinds of manipulative policies that Krugman champions that caused this collective ignorance in mainstream circles to begin with.
What the past proves, time and time again, is that establishment trained and educated economists are perhaps the most useless of all analysts.
They are perpetually wrong. Only independent analysts have ever been able to predict anything of value as far as our economic future - not because they are psychic, but because they have the advantage of standing outside the foggy propaganda of brainwashed financial academia.
It also proves that the appearance of prosperity means nothing if the fundamentals do not support the optimism. That is to say, a bullish stock market, a high dollar index and a low unemployment percentage mean nothing if such stats are generated by false methods and fiat. The fundamentals ALWAYS matter.
As we saw during the Great Depression, the markets cannot hide from reality forever.
I relate these points because the future I am about to suggest here might sound outlandish to some, because it is so contrary to the "official" accounting of our current financial world. It is important to remember that the mainstream, the majority, is almost always wrong and that the truth is very rarely accepted broadly until calamity has already fallen.
I outlined the hard facts behind the reality of economic downturn in my article "We Have Just Witnessed the Last Gasp of the Global Economy."
The bottom line is that the stock market, the greatest false indicator of all time, is on the verge of implosion; and the banking elites are positioning themselves to avoid blame for this implosion while the rest of us are being sold on the most elaborate recovery con-game ever conceived.
But what is the purpose behind this con-game? Lies are generally only told by those who hope to gain something through deception.
What do the elites hope to gain by creating a facade of recovery? They have openly admitted to the public on numerous occasions EXACTLY what they want - namely, the institution of a truly global and centralized economic system revolving around a highly controlled world currency framework and dominated by a select cult of banking oligarchs.
Anyone who claims that this is not the goal is either a liar or an uneducated fool.
I have covered the evidence supporting this program many times in the past, but it would seem with the precariously surreal nature of our world today that much needs repeating.
In 1988, the financial magazine 'The Economist' published an article titled "Get ready for a world currency by 2018" (Get Ready for the Phoenix) in which it outlined the framework for a global currency system called the "Phoenix" (a hypothetical title), administered by the International Monetary Fund by the year 2018, which would erase all national economic sovereignty and require governments to borrow from the world central banking authority, rather than print, in order to finance their infrastructure programs.
This would mean total control by the IMF over member nations as they beg and plead for more capital under the global currency umbrella. If this sounds familiar, it is because I have been warning about the IMF takeover of the global monetary system for at least six years.
The Economist actually admits that the Phoenix system would start out in the format of the Special Drawing Rights basket currency:
The phoenix would probably start as a cocktail of national currencies, just as the Special Drawing Right is today. In time, though, its value against national currencies would cease to matter, because people would choose it for its convenience and the stability of its purchasing power
The plan is to introduce a basket currency system as an alternative to the dollar as world reserve, then slowly but surely phase out all sovereign currencies until the basket becomes a currency itself - the ONLY currency.
Former World Bank Chief Economist Justin Yifu Lin seems to agree with this ideology, arguing that national currencies must be replaced with a supranational currency, and pointing out that no single currency has the strength to stand alone as world reserve:
"I think the dominance of the greenback is the root cause of global financial and economic crises... The solution to this is to replace the national currency with a global currency..."
I would mention that a "Phoenix" rises from the ashes of calamity reborn.
What ashes are the elites expecting the new global currency to rise from?
It is important to note that 'The Economist' is not just any random financial publication; it is in large part owned by the Rothschild banking family and is based out of the London financial center, meaning, The Economist does not have to "guess" on the economic developments of the future; it has an inside track on exactly what is planned to occur.
You can see my more recent analysis on the IMF global currency scheme here.
A plan for global governance has also been touted by international elites over the years, the roots of which would supposedly begin around 2015. The Gorbachev Foundation, which boasts many American elites as members, has long predicted the rise of a global government.
In 1995, the executive director of the foundation, Jim Garrison, had this to say to the San Francisco Weekly:
"Over the next 20 to 30 years, we are going to end up with world government It's inevitable. It will happen and become just as normal to have a relationship with the rest of the world as we now have, say, if you are a Californian and you go to Vermont."
At the Gorbachev-led State of the World Forum in 1995, Council On Foreign Relations member Zbigniew Brzezinski had this to say:
"We do not have a New World Order We cannot leap into world government in one quick step In brief, the precondition for eventual globalization - genuine globalization - is progressive regionalization, because thereby we move toward larger, more stable, more cooperative units."
Regionalization is already occurring as the BRIC nations form their own bilateral trade agreements and their own global bank, and this is by design.
The catalyst to trigger the end of the dollar and the dominance of a global currency system, I believe, will be the false East/West paradigm.
I have seen an incredible array of analytic interpretations of the macro-economy by multiple mainstream and independent financial writers, but very few of them recognize that the conflict between the West and the eastern BRICS is nothing more than a farce.
I have compiled a considerable profile of evidence on the reality that governments like Russia and China are actually complicit in the formation of a global currency and global government controlled by the IMF.
You can see that evidence:
Russia is Dominated by Global Banks, Too The New World Order and The Rise of The East False East/West Paradigm Hides the Rise of Global Currency

The New World Order and The Rise of The East
False East/West Paradigm Hides the Rise of Global Currency
China in particular has loudly pronounced a need for a global currency system to replace the dollar, and they have suggested that this system be controlled by the IMF:
The world economic crisis shows the, "inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system," Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan said in an essay released Monday by the bank. He recommended creating a currency made up of a basket of global currencies and controlled by the International Monetary Fund and said it would help, "to achieve the objective of safeguarding global economic and financial stability."

China is NOT anti-establishment or anti-new world order, nor is Russia.
Eastern opposition to the NWO is a lie. Period.
In fact, the BRICS have argued only for greater inclusion in the IMF system and have no intention of developing a legitimate alternative to "Western" globalization. If you do not understand that the BRICS are part of the NWO, not opposed to it, then you do not understand a thing.
With the BRICS on board with the plan for global currency, what is likely to happen over the course of the next few years if the schedule for an economic reset is on track for 2018?
As I outlined in my last article, the U.S. in particular has been prepped like a sacrificial lamb, with the populace for the most part oblivious to the extent of the threat.
Middle-class wealth is being driven into bonds and will be driven more so by market declines, which will progress over the next few months. This "herding" of capital into bonds is only in preparation for the death of the dollar's world reserve status, thus erasing what little savings were left among the common citizenry.
The ceremony initiating our nation's fiscal destruction will likely take place in the near term. To achieve global centralization by 2018, the elites would need a serious crisis soon in order to provide the proper collective panic required to generate public consent for global economic governance in four years' time.
The first, most important factor to consider is the fake conflict between the IMF and the U.S. Congress over the approval of IMF policy changes agreed upon in 2010. The U.S. has yet to officially sign off on the IMF policy measures that would bring more "inclusiveness" for developing nations like Russia and China, and this has led the IMF to assert that a move forward without the U.S. is necessary.
IMF head Christine Lagarde is now demanding that Congress pass the reforms of 2010; but with the election of a predominantly Republican government, those reforms have little or no chance of being approved.
Lagarde recently joked that she would be willing to "belly dance" to get IMF reforms passed (I would pass them just to avoid the gut churning image of that belly dance), but the joke will ultimately be on the U.S. as IMF heads suggest that if the current Congress does not pass reforms by the end of this year, they will be forced to apply a "Plan B".
The details of this Plan B are not public.
It is now highly likely that the IMF will set policy WITHOUT the input of the U.S., as they have warned they would, crippling the assumptions by many that the IMF is somehow a "U.S.-owned institution." It is actually the reverse; the IMF is setting the stage for ownership of the U.S. monetary structure, along with the Bank of International Settlements, which appears to be the capstone of the NWO system.
The next IMF meeting on SDR inclusion is not set, but will probably take place in early 2015.
It is expected that China and the Yuan will be officially added to the SDR basket. Gold should also be watched carefully. There is a reason why the BRICS have been accumulating thousands of tons of the precious metal.
The IMF introduction of gold into the SDR basket is inevitable, and a new Bretton Woods style-agreement has already been called for by a number of elites. The IMF has been openly discussing the ascension of the SDR to replace the dollar as the world reserve currency since at least 2011.
With developing nations already asking for help from the IMF due to volatility caused by the FED taper and the BRICS well into their own programs to remove the dollar as the world reserve, the only question left is:
How will the banks be able to accomplish the currency reset without taking blame for the resulting catastrophe that will no doubt bury the majority of middle-class and poor?
There is no way around it.
The elites need a geopolitical disaster so overwhelming that all economic changes taking place in the background go completely unnoticed. They also need to set themselves up as the prognosticators and rescuing heroes in the midst of the coming chaos, as outlined in my last article.
I do not know what that disaster will specifically look like, because there are too many possibilities to consider.
Think about this honestly, 10 years ago,
Would you or your friends and family have ever thought that the U.S. would be at war in Syria with a terrorist organization we created ourselves out of thin air? That we would be immersed in renewed tensions and the possibility of economic warfare with Russia? That our presidency would have attempted and failed the initiation of socialized healthcare? That our military would be tapped as a possible response force for domestic unrest? That an outbreak of Ebola would be suggested as a trigger for medical martial law? How many conspiracies have been exposed in just the past few years? How many government crimes have hit the headlines and then 'disappeared'?

Benghazi, Fast and Furious, IRS targeting of activists, government-aided illegal immigration, etc. - a nonstop parade of corruption that few would have thought possible a decade ago.
We are being boiled slowly, economically as well as politically. We are being conditioned to accept imminent crisis as a way of daily life, to become used to it and to blame these crises on hundreds of various scapegoats, but never the international banks.
And while the Titanic sinks, the band plays on, as mainstream pundits and dupes accuse independent analysts of "crying wolf."
The economic endgame is not about collapse alone. Collapse is nothing more than a process that ends abruptly only when public faith is finally lost. The endgame is about acceptance - the acceptance by the masses of a "new normal" in which financial and political terror become the foundation of daily life.
The endgame is, first and foremost, about the psyche of mankind and its mutation into something unrecognizable. This kind of pervasive conditioning requires immeasurable fear.
Our economic philosophy of sovereign trade and identity cannot be erased without it. The elites have already given us their timeline. The crash of 2008 was only the beginning of the program, and 2014-2015 looks to be the next stage.
I have written hundreds of articles on how to prepare and defuse the dangers of the impending reset, but the most important issue of all is that people understand the threat is at their doorstep. It's not a few years off or a decade away; it's here now.
We are right in the middle of collapse, even if many cannot see it. Watch global developments carefully, as market volatility increases and international conflicts escalate.
Time is up...
