We are all currently part of a movement that is
greater and more profound than we can comprehend at this time.
It does not
have a name and nobody started it, or is in charge. It is non-violent and
grassroots. It is global, classless, unquenchable and tireless. It has no
central ideology and it is the most diverse movement the world has ever
seen.
You are a part of it and if you're reading this, you KNOW it is
happening right before your very eyes.
It is growing by the day and spreading worldwide
with no exception.
The shared understanding is arising from different
economic sectors, cultures and regions. It has many roots, but primarily the
origins are morality, freedom and social justice movements. This is no
longer about simple resources infractions, or injustice. It is marked by
kinship and symbiosis and it is a fundamental rights movement about who we
are, what we are and why we are here.
It will also be marked by a
synchronous, omnipresent, decentralized energy that will be in every city
and country on earth.
The most advanced world order this planet has ever
seen is among us and there is nothing that can or will stop it now. Its base
will essentially be love and morality and its growth will be so powerful and
exponential that no war will topple its underlying strength.
What we are creating is completely unknown and foreign to humanity. We are
witnessing a transformation in humanity that will set us apart from almost
every life-form in the Universe.
This is the first time on earth that such a
powerful non-ideological movement has arisen. Strong ideological systems
such as religion, capitalism, socialism and every other "ism" which once
dominated our beliefs will cease to exist. The power structures which
confided in such ideological systems, fought for control of our lands, minds
and our freedom. The lessons have learned and it took tens of thousands of
years.
We were always told that salvation would be found in the domination
of a single system, but we now know that humanity's immune response to heal
political disease, economic infection and ecological corruption will have
nothing to do with domination and everything to do with changes in
ourselves.
We are building a capacity to respond.
Humanity knows exactly what to do to
prevail and we don't need any one person or entity to tell us. We will
survive anything as we always have, and we have just passed a the biggest
milestone in human history that has advanced our species into unchartered
territory.
Occupy, zeitgeist, libertarian, and a plethora of other social justice
movements are only incremental attempts to reach the energy climax that is
needed to unleash the full potential of this movement.
In many ways these
small movements can often deter and delay the inevitable power of humanity's
evolution into full responsible stewardship of planet earth, its inhabitants
and abundant resources. The mainstream media knows it is happening, but
cannot and will not highlight its strengths for the time being.
We must be
aware of any
movement such as "Occupy" which is heavily
emphasized in the
media and
has an ultimate purpose for the current power structure and those
who hypnotically follow its flow.
The unnamed movement has no spokesperson
and will receive little or no media attention.
When it's time, the movement
will be the mainstream media and there will be no other movements. When it
reaches full strength, there will be no signs, protests or assembly to
resist anything... it will just be.
All governments, elite, power and political classes will fall almost
simultaneously and they will not be able to function in the new society the
movement will aspire to. We will govern ourselves according to the laws of
nature, love and morality.
This is what the future holds for humankind and it is not centuries or even
decades away. It is right around the corner and you will be a part of it.
This is why you are reading this, and this is why you are here.
Your love is
heard, the message is loud and clear and it's time for change.
Prepare
yourself for the shift, as there will be no other like it and you will not
want to miss it!
