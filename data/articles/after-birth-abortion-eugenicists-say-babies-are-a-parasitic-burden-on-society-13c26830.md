According to Alberto Giubilini and Francesca
Minerva, after-birth abortion is proposed as a form of contraception
that would allow babies to be killed after they are born.
In a
paper published in the Journal of Medical Ethics:
[W]hen circumstances
occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call
after-birth abortion should be permissible
[W]e propose to call this
practice after-birth abortion, rather than infanticide, to emphasize
that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a
fetus
rather than to that of a child.
Therefore, we claim that killing a
newborn could be ethically permissible in all the circumstances where
abortion would be. Such circumstances include cases where the newborn has
the potential to have an (at least) acceptable life, but the well-being of
the family is at risk.
Giubilini and Minerva believe that infants are a
threat to parents because of their financial burden to their parents and
that this justifies the murder of new-born babies.
In the Senate, Joe Pitts and Chris Smith
spoke out against this ideology.
Smith explains:
Giubilini and Minerva
say the devaluation of new-born babies is inextricably linked to the
devaluation of unborn children.
Ann Furedi of the British Pregnancy Advisory
Board
stated that it was of no consequence to define the point when a fetus is
subject to legal limitation with regard to abortion rights.
Giubilini and
Minerva agree with this summation by stating that,
merely being human is not
in itself a reason for ascribing someone a right to life. Indeed, many
humans are not considered subjects of a right to life, such as spare
embryos where research on embryo stem cells is permitted or fetuses where
abortion is permitted.
By defining personhood as being established
some time after birth, Giubilini and Minerva assert that a fetus has no
claim to personhood, and therefore no right to life.
They write that:
[I]n
order for a harm to occur, it is necessary that someone is in the condition
of experiencing that harm. If a potential person, like a fetus and a
newborn, does not become an actual person, like you and us, then there is
neither an actual nor a future person who can be harmed, which means that
there is no harm at all
In these cases, since non-persons have no moral
rights to life, there are no reasons for banning after-birth abortions
Indeed, however weak the interests of actual people can be, they will always
trump the alleged interest of potential people to become actual ones,
because this latter interest amounts to zero.
Giubilini and Minerva support previous arguments
for infanticide regardless of whether or not the baby were given a short
lifespan due to a medical prognosis.
Simply by being born the baby is
regarded as an,
unbearable burden on someone, then people should be given
the chance of not being forced to do something they cannot afford.
Parents, relatives and even society should be
enabled to force a mother to submit her child to infanticide because of the
benefits that one less person would bring to our world.
Giubilini and
Minerva state that infants are dependent on parents just as fetuses are
parasites to the mothers body. And since no one can ensure that this person
will not die prematurely in the future, the investment of resources, time
and emotional support cannot be assumed to be a right of the infant.
During pregnancy, the development of the fetus
can reveal defects that can legally warrant a partial-birth abortion.
Giubilini and Minerva argue that this fact can be extended to after birth
because a defective baby can be an economical, social or psychological
burden because of the energy needed to care for the child.
They say that,
people should be given the chance of not being forced to do something they
cannot afford.
The prevention of right to life for infants has
another supporter in a study published by the Archives of General Psychiatry
(AGP) that
asserted pre-mature babies are at an increased risk for bipolar
disorder, depression and a wide range of psychosis that would render them a
danger to themselves and others later in life.
Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of SANE, a
mental health charity, stated:
We already knew that premature birth may be
linked to schizophrenia, but to see evidence linking it to a range of
psychiatric conditions which required hospitalization is striking.
While Giubilini and Minerva use
eugenics agendas
to coerce the public into believing that society would be better off without
certain burdensome infants, an outright
attack on fertility is taking place.
Dr. Martin Matzuk , professor of molecular
biology, molecular and human genetics, and pharmacology at Baylor College of
Medicine (BCM), is working on a birth-control pill for men that blocks the
proteins essential for sperm production - rendering men voluntarily
infertile.
The BCM has a long
history of working to expanding the eugenics agenda with the use of
genetic technologies; including
collaboration with the German Nazis and their march toward using
genetics to create a better human race.
By looking for justice as
fairness with the ethical practice of genetics and eugenics concerning
applied science and social constructs.
The advantage of eugenics ideology in
genetic technology is viewed as,
the greatest benefit of individuals with
the least advantages.
And so by subverting the fact of eugenics in genetic
advances will alleviate prejudice and make sure that the eugenics agenda is
devoid of negative perceptions so that the genetically disadvantaged could
be touted as the beneficiaries of eugenic applications in genetic
technologies.
Last month, the Bill and Melinda
Gates
Foundation (BMGF) hosted The London Family Planning Summit (LFPS) where the
BMGF secured funding for
depopulation efforts in Africa, India and the Southeast Asian region.
Melinda Gates believes that if she can prevent
40% of people who would otherwise have been born, she could justify her
family planning scheme to make women healthier whos,
families are more
successful and their communities are more prosperous.
Simply put:
the BMGF
has classified unwanted pregnancies as justification for killing people
and they are focusing on eventually eliminating this number to reduce the
worlds population.
Africa, a big focus for the BMGF is being targeted along
with Muslim nations.
In this propaganda cartoon, the depiction of
brown and black women as disfigured potatoes having much more fun because
they have fewer children is not only offensive, but telling of how these
global Elite view the people they purport to be saving. By preventing
births, the film says that 600,000 people would not be born.
Contraception as a first step in
the global
Elites plan to depopulation by appearing to help save lives of women could
be quite effective.
