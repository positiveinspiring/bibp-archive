A private but extremely influential silent
individual, Dr. Michael Van de Meer is the person predicting a
financial collapse of the United States starting on September 30th. That
is the end of the fiscal year and the final date for payments the Federal
Reserve Board wants to act, but cannot, because it is in a catatonic state,
as the leaders of every state in the world is.
There will also be indications on September the 16th, he informed me
some ten months ago,
Although September 30th will be the tipping
point at which the trees fate is determined, the branches will not hit
the ground until October 7 and 27th and going on into November, he
says.
Dr. Van de Meer correctly predicted the
financial panic that started in September of 2008 (also 10 months in
advance) and has made many other accurate predictions.
In a separate confirmation the Chinese Government is no longer entertaining
and investing in derivatives, and have declared a Nova-to, meaning
they will not be paying the trillions due on these these illegal
instruments. In fact the Chinese are using stronger language saying these
criminally foisted instruments are a declaration of a financial war.
Meanwhile, in a significant break in corporate media censorship, the CBS TV
program 60 minutes reported that Alan Greenspan, in concert with
Bill Clinton and George Bush Senior facilitated in the year 2000,
during the middle of the night, the passage of a criminal, highly illegal
unconstitutional Bill that created the mortgage and property bubble.
The bill allowed unscrupulous individuals in the
major Banks and Insurance Corporations such as I.A.G. to hedge bets at a
cent to the dollar.
This allowed them to create derivatives
contracts whose supposed face value runs into the quintillions of dollars
(in either the British or American systems that is the next number after a
quadrillion!) . On September 30th all these
fiat numbers created out of nothing
will no longer be accepted. Both China and Japan have not said they will
only accept gold from America but they have none.
Bernanke and
Geithner are desperately calling the
people who own the gold and asking for some but they have been told they
will not get even one ounce.
The bundling of the worthless inflated dollars created a devaluation in
the banking system and major banks went down in a domino spiral,
the affects of which will be felt for many years around the world. The
destruction of the worlds accounting system is so extreme that the tax base
of every state and municipal government is strained, some house values have
fallen 80%, farmers cannot get credit for parts, seed, fertilizers and water
meaning many innocent people will pay, maybe even with their lives.
The Wall Street banksters that own
the
Fed are being forced to put all their derivatives garbage on the
books by September 30th. If they do that, they will be exposed as totally
bankrupt.
The new financial system has been embraced by
the
Vatican,
the British Empire and
the Dragon family as well as the new
Japanese government so it is hard to see how the Fed will be able meet the
demands. Also people are now on to them and without secrecy their entire
fiat con-job ceases to function.
There are still so many smart people, supposedly educated in economics and
finance, who do not understand the true nature of the banking system that
is now collapsing. People need to march on Washington by the millions to
demand that the right to issue currency be returned to the people.
Those of us who are aware need to get as many people as possible to learn
the truth about the Feds. The Federal Reserve Board is a conglomerate of 12
banks and
the Rothschild family. They spew out
trillions of worthless Fiat
(out of nothing) dollars to the Americans and the world at large.
Please read what is on each dollar bill (this note is legal tender for
debts, public and private) and try to explain to the public that means we
are spending worthless debt dollars. We all need them to ask exactly who we
owe this debt to.
Please call this number 1-800-595-6596 to order a book written by Edward
Griffing entitled
The Creature from Jekyll Island.
It is guaranteed to anger you and make you
demand change. It is about how the Feds took control of the USs security by
seizing the right to print and control money. It must be brought to your
attention that the Federal Reserve is a hoax that has been insinuated on the
US and the entire world by means of the contrived name Federal Reserve.
Even people who have taken and MBA and have
studied all the subjects taught at universities about Finance and
Economics are led to believe the Fed is owned by the government,
i.e. we the people when it is not. I was a financial journalist for 25
years and yet never learned this truth until recently.
The fact is the Fed is a pariah institution
created in the dead of the night in an empty Congress on Christmas eve in
1913.
Close to a hundred years later they have put us
in debt to the tune of quintillions of dollars, meaning theoretically
we and our descendants will be debt slaves forever. This system must
be brought to closure. The book will rivet you.
The book explains how a group of Europeans were able to steal the American
people constitutionally given rights.
Here are the names of these criminals.
-
Nelson W. Aldrich, business associate of
J.P. Morgan and father in law of
John Rockefeller Junior
-
Abraham Piat, assistant secretary of
Treasury
-
Frank A. Vanderlip, president of
National Bank representing William Rockefeller and the banking and
the banking house of Kuhn & Loeb & co
-
Henry P. Davidson, partner to J.P.
Morgan
-
Charles D. Norton, president of J.P.
Morgans, First National Bank
-
Benjamin Strong, head of J. P. Morgan's
First National Bankers Trust Company
-
Paul M. Warburg, head of J.P. Morgan's
Bankers and Trust company, a brother to Max Warburg , head of the
Warburg consortium in Germany and the Netherlands, all representing
the Rothschild's
These people plotted their evil deed of
enslaving the American people on
Jekyll Island in Georgia, U.S.A. before
returning to Europe.
The compromised the America way of life by
taking control of their money and the rights to create it. They then took
control of all industry and created the tax code in 1914 to force Americans
to pay for the compounded debts insinuated on them from that moment on. they
would insinuated upon the American populace from that moment on.
This was facilitated by the arch traitor
Woodrow Wilson.
We the people need to rid ourselves of the
Pariah known as the
Federal Reserve Bank. The people need to
reverse this evil and start issuing real dollars again that are based on the
good will of the American people and their ingenuity. The financial
devaluation that has happened over the years has led to a loss of
sovereignty for the American people and has caused untold calamity
throughout the world.

The new financial system that will replace the Fed will not allow any off
ledger transactions nor any hedge funds or derivatives.
Wall Street will not be allowed to as Dr.
Van de Meer puts it to,
do all their contrivances selling worthless
air and paper and contrived named instruments that by their very names
are comic to the ear. They have been gerrymandered to fool the millions
who buy worthless stocks just like little old ladies in sneakers working
slot machines.
The American people who are 4% of the worlds
population but consume 40% of the worlds resources have been paying for it
all with illusory money.
The illusion has burst and there will be a 90
degree fall in the value of money, followed by a lot of hard work as the
country rebuilds itself back into greatness. Fortunately, by developing all
the new technology that was suppressed by the Feds, the end result of the
rebuilding will be a golden age for all.
But remember, there will be no gain without
pain. However, the Americans are resilient people and will pull together and
be a more informed and strong nation once again.
First though, they need to seek out this Wall
Street crowd; tar and feather them, and run them out of the country on a
rail.
