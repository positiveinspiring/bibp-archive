Who knew the Pentagon had muscled into the US
vaccine program?
DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has been doing research on
vaccine production.
Theyve found a way to produce flu vaccines a lot faster
than
Big Pharma.
See,
Utilizing vaccines grown on tobacco cells, instead of the traditional
chicken eggs, DARPA has turned out a staggering 10 million doses of flu
vaccine in just one month.
This Blue
Angel" project, as its called, suddenly puts the Pentagon in the
forefront of
the vaccine business.
The big question is:
why is the Army
involved in vaccines at all?
And the answer is no surprise. According to DARPA, its all about readiness in containing
bio-threats. Translated, that
means terrorist attacks that could use flu viruses.
This is a sinister development. It creates a potential scenario in which the
military can invent the bio-threat and then step in and provide the
solution. It doesnt really matter whether the bio-threat is real or
imaginary.
The threat would offer the chance to initiate a martial-law scenario, after
which the military vaccine would be made mandatory, destroying the right of
each state in the union to permit, as is now the case, people to opt out of
vaccination on religious, medical, or ethical grounds.
The Pentagon is famous for developing weapons and then lobbying for
battlefield opportunities to use them.
This is part and parcel of their war
is forever mentality. Well, in this case, the vaccine becomes the defensive
weapon, and you can be sure the Pentagon will strive to deploy it in a
situation that demands it - a chilling prospect.
Several medical issues arise as well.
First, what safety tests have been
done to ensure that tobacco viruses dont enter these DARPA vaccines through
lab contamination, thereby finding their way into the human bloodstream, via
injection, and causing uncharted health problems? No word about that, just
as there was no word, historically, about various Pentagon weapons systems
that later proved to be dangerous to the soldiers using them (e.g., the
Bradley Fighting Vehicle).
Hidden in the story about the new means of vaccine production:
the
employment of a synthetic construction that is supposed to mimic the human
immune system.
To test the ability of the tobacco-vaccines to induce a
robust immune response, this new chemical lab-version of an immune system
becomes the guinea pig. But there is no proof that such an artifact works or
is translatable to actual processes of the human body.
Finally, DARPA states that the vaccine it just produced contains aluminum.
Toxicity for humans is thus guaranteed.
In the hands of the Pentagon, what could possibly go wrong with this Blue
Angel program? Everything.
In case we need to review the most recent epidemic advertised by
the CDC
and the World Health Organization (WHO), it killed, by the most generous
estimates, 20,000 people worldwide.
Despite being labeled a catastrophic
level-6 pandemic, the
H1N1 Swine Flu turned out to be a comparative dud. WHO
states that, every year, seasonal non-pandemic flu kills between 250,000 and
500,000 people.
The CDC and WHO relentlessly promoted Swine Flu as a monster menace that
could invade and decimate the planet. Therefore, everyone needed to step up
and take the vaccine.
These civilian agencies are mere pikers compared to
the Pentagon.
