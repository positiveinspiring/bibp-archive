Part I
22 July 2011
I have written frequently
(but not recently) about the wave of
economic terrorism which Wall Street launched against Europe - with
the full support/blessing of the U.S. government.
With that campaign of
terrorism having nearly reached fruition, I will review these events one
more time.
Essentially, it began with
Goldman Sachs "rape of AIG. AIG was the guinea pig of this experiment.
The banksters had already perfected their terrorist weapons: interest-rate swaps
and credit default swaps. Now they needed to determine if they actually
worked - i.e. if their scam-victims were gullible enough to be fooled by
bankster double-talk, and if our legal systems would tolerate this
massive, systemic fraud.
The interest-rate swaps had
already been tested. During the time that economic genius Larry Summers
was foolishly put in charge of Harvard, this genius managed to lose
approximately $1 billion in financing merely $2 billion of debt, via
interest rate swaps. The reasoning is obvious: if Larry Summers could be
conned that easily, then so could the geniuses in charge of Europes
various economies.
The Wall Street banksters
(and some European banking Oligarchs) then systematically targeted every
city, state, and large public institution foolish enough to listen to the
banksters con.
The mechanics of these interest rate swaps (i.e. the
contracts) were extremely complex. Naturally if youre trying to scam
someone with such paper-fraud, you make the wording as convoluted as
possible, so that its impossible for the victim to ever fully understand
the contract they are signing.
Conversely, the
nature
of the scam itself was incredibly simple: getting these cities, states and
institutions to make massive bets on interest rates against the
same group of bankers who
controlled those interest rates.
One half of the bet was held by the scam-victim, while the other half was
held by another multinational bankster.
The bankers were able to con all of
their victims into believing that they would be the winners of all of
these bets, with the sophisticated, multinational bankers being the chumps
who would suffer all of the losses.
Even more incredibly, none
of these victims became suspicious even once they had become aware that the
banksters were
all taking the
same side of the bet:
that interest rates would go down, with all of the scam-victims making the
opposite bet - that interest rates would go up.
What actually happened? By
incredible coincidence shortly after the bankers had finished making all
of these bets, U.S. and European interest rates crashed to their lowest
level in history - and stayed there.
This resulted in
maximum losses for the scam-victims, and
maximum profits
for the banks - an amazing stroke of good fortune for all of these
banksters. Though the final tally of this scam has yet to be realized, the
haul certainly amounts to $100s of billions - if it hasnt already exceeded
$1 trillion. While both civil and criminal prosecutions have been initiated
by several European authorities, as of this date, no bank has been
punished in any way for perpetrating this massive fraud.
Similarly, credit default
swaps are a scam which is very complex in its execution, while
mind-numbingly simple in concept. First, the bankers pour gasoline all over
the houses that they wish to burn down. Then they find chumps who are
willing to write-up fire insurance policies on all of these homes - with
the bankers being the beneficiaries, even though they dont
own
any of the homes. The bankers then set all of the homes on fire, and then
collect their insurance proceeds.
Translating that metaphor to
the real world, the houses were sovereign European states. The gasoline
was the massive debts which the banksters had goaded these
governments into taking-on, through promising them that the
$trillions in credit default swaps which the banksters were writing-up would
magically allow all of these countries to all borrow much more
money, at lower interest rates than ever before - forever.
To call this a Trojan
Horse maneuver would be giving the sovereign governments who were duped by
this preposterous nonsense too much credit. Rather, it was more like the
clich√© of the cartoon-villain who hands a birthday cake to his target - except that the candles are actually lit sticks of dynamite, and (of course)
the victim never notices the suspicious candles.
Even this metaphor isnt
entirely accurate, however, as back in the real world, the banksters
actually used much more dynamite than cake. The notional value of
these credit default swaps climbed above $60 trillion - larger than the
entire global economy, and many times in excess of the debts being
(supposedly) insured.
Returning to the
arson/insurance analogy, the banksters were allowed to insure these houses
for many times their actual value, with themselves as beneficiaries (even
though they didnt own the homes) - and still their victims didnt suspect a
thing. More unbelievably, with all of these European houses now fully
aflame, even now most of the victims have not
begun to suspect
arson.
Here is how the credit
default swap scam actually operates in European (and global) debt markets.
The scam-victim is led to believe that placing these massive amounts of
insurance (i.e bets) on all of the debt they are issuing will magically
and permanently lower their borrowing costs forever. It is even
less-plausible than believing in a perpetual motion machine, but it fooled
all of the leaders of Europe, and was instrumental in inducing all of these
governments to allow debt-levels to soar (the gasoline I spoke of
earlier).
What a credit default swap actually
does is to place a
highly-leveraged bet against that nation defaulting on
its debt.
Note that the banksters were
unable to stop themselves from engaging in these bets
amongst themselves
due to the compulsiveness of their greed and gambling-addiction.
When Morgan
Stanley
refused to honour one of these bets which it had placed with
Citigroup, Citi was forced to sue. Even after Morgan Stanley was forced to
liquidate the so-called collateral which had backed this bet, it was
facing a pay-out of nearly 300:1. This gives people some idea of the massive
leverage in this $60 trillion market - and the visions of dollar signs
dancing before the eyes of greedy banksters.
Also note the other
requirement here: finding a chump willing to write-up all of this
insurance (i.e. to take the other side of the bet). Enter AIG. As with the
fleecing of Harvard, AIG was the test case. In this case, the test was
to see if Goldman Sachs could dupe AIG into insuring (against default) some
of the
worst
mortgage feces
which Goldman Sachs had been able to find - out of all the
massive mortgage-fraud perpetrated by Wall Street.
The reasoning was
that if they could get AIG to insure these products (the worlds largest
insurance company), then they could dupe anyone into insuring
anything.
Not only did AIG perform
magnificently as the perfect dupe, but Goldman Sachs was then able to get
their good friend, former CEO, and then-Treasury Secretary Hank Bazooka
Paulson to set up a $160 billion slush fund within the
carcass of AIG. The U.S. government then demanded that AIG
pay Goldman Sachs 100 cents on the dollar for every penny of this credit
default swap fraud.
With their test case a
huge success, the banksters were now ready to officially unleash their
economic terrorism on Europe. It has been painful in its simplicity. It
begins with the U.S. propaganda-machine (i.e. the mainstream media). They
were instructed to all don their Chicken Little costumes, and then to run
around shrieking (24/7) that the sky was falling in European (and
only European) debt markets.
The very same American media pundits who
write day-after-day about the Euro debt crisis (across an ocean) have
found the U.S. debt crisis to be totally invisible
- despite the
fact that the
level of insolvency within the U.S. exceeds even
the worst of the Euro debt-sinners. This propaganda-campaign began in
earnest late in 2009, and has been relentlessly maintained ever since.
This made the actual
terrorist attacks in the credit default swap market childs play. Wall
Street terrorists began massively shorting all of these credit default
swaps. The shorting increased the level of risk/leverage on the
credit default swaps themselves, while the relentless propaganda increased
the perceived
level of risk on this debt.
The combination
of these forces, pushed the prices for this insurance sky-high.
Because the size of
the credit default swap market grossly exceeds the size of the debts
themselves, the tail can now wag the dog.
Driving up the prices on the so-called credit default insurance now
directly drives up the interest rates on European
sovereign debt.
At best, many of these Euro
nations were barely solvent before the Wall Street terrorists began
driving up European interest rates with their terrorist attacks. Since that
time, they have caused interest rates for Greece, Ireland, and Portugal to
roughly triple, while their newer victims/targets (Spain
and Italy) have also seen their borrowing costs explode.
This has made the
anti-Europe propaganda and the shorting of the credit default swaps the
proverbial self-fulfilling prophesy. The more they short and shriek, the
higher interest rates go, making these nations even more insolvent, causing
interest rates to go still higher. Wall Street terrorists can now literally
drive European interest rates to any level they desire - with one proviso.
What Wall Streets
terrorists dont want to do is to drive these economies into formal
default (i.e. formal bankruptcy). This would force these Euro states to
simply repudiate $100s of billions (if not $trillions) in bond debt - and
detonate the entire credit default swap market. The ultimate irony (and
betrayal) of the credit default swap scam is that this was
never
insurance.
Real insurance directly implies that the insurer is capable of
indemnifying the insured. Obviously there is no insurer standing by to
make the extremely leveraged pay-outs on this $60 trillion of
supposed insurance. This makes credit default swaps a
prima facie
fraud.
Detonating the credit
default swap market would kill the Goose that lays the Golden Eggs, and
Wall Streets economic terrorists (and the ultra-wealthy bond-holders for
whom they front) are still planning on harvesting many more eggs from
these geese.
Indeed, as we shall see in Part II, the golden metaphor may
literally be true.
Part II
25 July 2011
In
Part I, I explained and (for many) introduced readers to two of the
major scam-vehicles which the Wall Street Oligarchs (and a few European
brethren) unleashed upon the world - and in particular the nations of
Europe.
Interest rate swaps and credit default swaps (both forms of
"derivatives") have been used to inflict trillions of dollars in
losses on their victims, with no end to this massive tally in sight.
As I watched Wall Street terrorists decimate the debt-markets
(and thus the economies) of European nations one-by-one, I had assumed that
such an unprecedented economic "attack" against these nations had been a
goal unto itself. I was mistaken. Instead, what has recently become apparent
is that such terrorist attacks on Europe were merely the means to an
even greater end: to completely plunder all the wealth of these nations.
In furtherance of this objective, the banking crime syndicate
(and the ultra-wealthy bond parasites whom they represent) have formulated a
three-pronged scheme to drain every last drop of wealth from these economies
(and nations):
-
Using these fraudulent bond debts to attach a legal
claim on the large, national gold-hoards which these nations claim
to still possess
-
Attaching "loss guarantees" to the bad-debts of the Euro
debt-sinners
-
Ramming through a full economic integration of all
these Euro-zone nations
I will address these economic "crimes against humanity" in
order.
The same Western central banks (and bankers) who
literally dumped thousands of tons of gold onto the global market
over a two-decade period - claiming that they had no use for this "barbarous
relic" - are now all singing a different tune. They have completely ceased
their own gold sales, for one of two reasons: they have now decided to hoard
all of their remaining gold, or their vaults are empty, and they
simply have no more gold to "sell".
Either interpretation of events is plausible.
However,
depending on which premise is correct, the
decision by Western banking authorities to designate the national gold
hoards of these nations as "collateral" for their (fraudulent) bond debts
has two entirely different (and separate) motivations. If the gold still
exists, then naming gold as collateral for debts which could never be repaid
(and where default is imminent) is nothing less than the theft of these
nations' gold reserves.
Conversely, it is also highly plausible that there are no
(remaining) hoards of gold hidden in bankster vaults (at least none which
belongs to these governments). Why is there reason to suspect that the
claims that these nations possess large gold reserves are more fantasy than
fact?
Because when Western banksters were dumping their thousands of tons of
gold onto the market to crush the "life" out of that market, their primary
method of "delivering" this gold onto the market was not outright "sales" of
gold, but rather "leases".
Here I must defer to the years of time and effort which the
vigilant gang at GATA (the "Gold Anti-Trust Action" Committee) have
devoted to monitoring the activities of these bankers. It has long been
their suspicion that the "gold reserves" listed by many/most/all Western
nations are complete fiction - as they do not account for the
countless tons of "leased gold" which will never (and could never) be
returned to these bank vaults.
In other words, most of the "gold" held in
these European vaults are not gold bars physically present in these
vaults, but rather merely stacks of gold "IOU's".
Armed with this additional data, it must now be obvious what
the other potential motive would be in attaching a legal claim on these
(fictional) "gold reserves". It would allow the cabal of Western bankers to
"take possession" of gold (which does not exist), and then claim to be
"holding" all of this gold in some vault even further removed from prying
eyes.
Why would such a charade be necessary, or even useful?
Because most of the Euro governments who claim to "hold" these gold reserves
do not even store their own gold. Instead, these nations were
persuaded to allow their gold to be stored at more "secure" locations - such
as Fort Knox, home to the U.S.'s own "legendary" (mythical?) hoard of gold.
In fact, there is a very good reason to suspect that the
vault at Fort Knox does not hold stacks of gold bars, but rather
merely stacks of paper "IOU's" - that reason being that the U.S. has
absolutely refused to conduct any public audit of its supposed hoard of gold
for more than 50 years. It is nothing less than "un-American" for the U.S.
to continue to claim that it holds far more gold than any other nation on
Earth, and not want to show-off that gold on regular occasions.
Indeed, the question-mark surrounding the Fort Knox gold is
less of a "mystery" than a farce.
Roughly
one month ago, the U.S. Treasury Department's "Inspector General", Eric
Thorson (the one individual personally responsible for verifying the claims
of the Treasury Department) announced that any audit of Fort Knox would be
"redundant".
The obvious question to ask is: how could something which
hasn't been done for over 50 years be "redundant"? Mr. Thorson had a good
answer for that: because he personally "believed" the gold was there. And
with that statement, an entire new "realm" opens up in the world of
accounting: the "faith-based audit".
Forget about all of that time-consuming "counting", and
line-by-line "verification" of numbers. The accountant (or "Inspector") in
question simply signs an affidavit personally attesting to their unequivocal
"belief" that the books are in order, and presto! - "audit" complete. It's
faster, more efficient, and (in the case of the U.S. government) completely
above reproach, since (as we know) all U.S. government officials are both
omniscient and scrupulously honest.
To be fair to "Inspector" Thorson, he had a very, very, very
good reason for "believing" the U.S. government's claims about its
Fort Knox holdings - despite having never actually seen one of the
gold bars personally. In its infinite wisdom, the U.S. government put a
"seal" on the Fort Knox vault (just like with the tombs of ancient Egyptian
pharaohs).
And since every time he has "checked" the seal is still there,
Inspector Thorson "knows" that all of the Fort Knox gold must be there.
Apparently a "cunning plan" where someone in the U.S.
government breaks the seal, removes the gold, and then makes a
new seal (at some point in the last 50+ years) is simply too diabolically
clever for Inspector Thorson to even contemplate.
And so we have the "last
word" from the Western banking cabal (and their "friends" in the U.S.
government): all of the Western gold hoards "must" be intact, because they
are believed to be intact. In much the same way, we can all "know"
that Santa Claus exists - as long as old St. Nick remains "alive" in our
hearts.
The bottom-line is that we are left with two competing
theories regarding the efforts of the banksters to "seize" this purported
gold as collateral. If the gold exists, then the banksters simply
plan to steal all of it, in return for their fraudulent bond-debts,
denominated in their own, worthless paper.
Conversely, if the gold does not exist, then each and every
day there is a very real risk that these deadbeat governments would want to
(or be forced to) sell some or all of that gold. Most certainly,
anyone wanting to fork-over $10's of billions for a stack of yellow bars
would actually want to see those yellow bars - at least once.
And
since such "suspicious" buyers might also want to "test" the gold they are
purchasing, attempting to flog a lot of gold-plated tungsten bars would also
be a tactic prone to failure.
Thus by "confiscating" all of this mythical
gold, it can be safely "stored" where no one would ever need to see it
again.
Before I move on to the next "prong of attack" against the
nations of Europe, it's important to pause to explicitly note why it would
be so disastrous for Western governments (and Western banker Oligarchs) if
it were discovered that the 20,000 tons of gold they claim to still
possess was nothing but a gigantic lie.
To do this, I must first explain why the banksters were
relentlessly dumping thousands of tons of gold in order to extremely
suppress that market.
In our monetary system, gold is "the canary in the
coal mine". When the price of an ounce of gold moved from under $300/oz to
over $1500/oz in roughly a decade, it did not/does not mean that the gold we
are buying today is "super-gold", but is in fact the same substance we were
buying for 20% of that price a decade ago.
Obviously if it is not possible
for the same ounce of gold to be more intrinsically valuable then
the only other possibility is that the perceived value of the
banksters' worthless paper has declined by 80% in 10 years.
Note that the sickening collapse of the banksters' fiat-paper
has occurred despite the widespread belief that Western governments are
"holding" roughly 20,000 tons of gold to (sort-of) "back" their mountains of
fiat paper (and much larger mountains of debt) - in today's prices that
amounts to trillions of dollars. Should most (or all) of that "gold"
be discovered not to exist, it would represent much more than merely the
single largest conspiracy of fraud in the history of the world.
To begin with, it would mean that all of these near-bankrupt
governments would be trillions of dollars poorer than previously believed.
Secondly, the same Western fiat-currencies which were crumbling in value
despite belief in the mythical gold-hoards of the West would now
disintegrate at a much greater speed.
The mechanics are obvious:
with actual, global stockpiles of
gold much, much smaller than previously believed, overnight the price of
gold would move to somewhere around $5,000/oz. About one second after
that, the world's oil-producers would decide that if gold was suddenly
"worth" $5,000/oz (expressed in worthless banker-paper) then their oil
would also be worth much more - with $500/barrel seeming to be a nice, round
(plausible) figure.
In a matter of days, prices for everything would be
spiraling out of control.
However, as was noted with the rising price of
gold, what these "price increases" would actually represent would be the
even more-rapid collapse of Western fiat paper - and undoubtedly the
beginning of a hyperinflationary spiral (i.e. banker-paper going to zero).
Having only examined the first avenue of this three-pronged
economic assault on Europe, we can already see the enormous stakes in these
acts of economic (serial) rape. It either represents defrauding the nations
of Europe out of $trillions in gold (which rightfully belongs to the
peoples of these nations, not their governments or central banks), or it
is yet another desperation-tactic to temporary forestall the collapse of the
banksters' entire fiat-currency
Ponzi scheme.
As readers will see in Part III, the other aspects of the
banksters' master-plan are equally diabolical and momentous, leading
inexorably to a final objective: the economic enslavement of all the peoples
of Europe.
Part III
28 July 2011
In
Part I of this series, I reviewed the campaign of U.S.
economic terrorism which has ravaged many of the economies of Europe - and set the stage for their economic destruction.
In
Part II, I identified three of the most important strategies which will
be used to finish the job, and discussed one of them: either to steal
the national gold reserves of these nations, or to hide the fact
that those national hoards of gold were already squandered.
In this installment I will
focus on the second strategy for completing the looting of Europe. It is a
mere two-word phrase, and arguably the most-odious two-word combination in
the realm of 21st century economics: loss guarantees.
It is the
ultimate form of welfare for both the banker Oligarchs and the bond
parasites, and the principles behind it are extremely simple:
-
Direct hand-outs are the visible
part of any/all welfare for the elites. Indeed, that component of
welfare-for-the-rich is essentially the only part of these schemes
which is understood and thus noted by the general public - and so they must
be kept to a minimum (the proverbial tip of the iceberg).
-
In order to steal the
$10s of trillions which these Vampires are currently in the process of
plundering from us, it is necessary to lie about (and thus hide)
most of what is being stolen.
It is in this respect that
our political leaders are earning the campaign-bribes which these
Oligarchs used to buy our governments.
In fact lying about
things and hiding things are arguably the only two talents
possessed by the current crop of Western political leaders.
We got our first real
exposure to loss guarantees after the Crash of 08, and the multi-trillion
dollar extortion campaign which Wall Street based upon that deliberately
created crash.
Naturally when the (banker-friendly) propaganda machine
writes about the costs of all of the Wall Street welfare they only ever
point to the tip of the iceberg: the direct hand-outs - totaling somewhere
around a paltry $1 trillion. However, once the 0% interest loans and loss
guarantees are added in, suddenly the Wall Street hand-outs swell to
roughly $15 trillion (and counting).
It is a testimony to the
monumental stupidity and apathy of the average Western citizen (in this case
Americans) when we see how easy it was to dupe the American people.
Understand first of all that both the banksters and the politicians (at
least those at the very top) have known all along that
the Wall
Street fraud-factories are all hopelessly insolvent - and hiding
countless $trillions in losses.
It is common knowledge that
Wall Street was leveraged by an (insane) average of more
than 30:1 at the time that their Ponzi-schemes imploded. The arithmetic is
simple: a loss of roughly 3% on the underlying assets which were leveraged
would take the entire paper-empire of Wall Street to zero.
Most of
the Wall Street scam-products were based upon the U.S. housing sector.
Prices for U.S. homes have now plummeted in excess of 30% -
ten
times what would be necessary to make all of Wall Street insolvent.
Even worse, many of the exotic products (i.e. bets) devised by the Wall
Street Vampires were so unstable and/or heavily leveraged that losses well
in excess of 100% are possible.
In this respect, the example
I like to use is when
one bankster sued another - in this case, Citigroup suing Morgan Stanley
to force Morgan Stanley to honor its losses on just
one credit
default swap.
Even after liquidating the so-called collateral
which backed this contract, Morgan Stanley was faced with not a mere 100%
loss, but rather a 300:1 loss (or
30,000%).
Upon examining these facts,
we discover the cruel, horrifying truth about these loss guarantees: what
they are really are guaranteed losses. Thus in typical
deadbeat fashion, the U.S. government immediately
committed itself
to more than $10 trillion in Wall Street losses - while not actually paying
for thoses losses
at least not right away.
Here is how the shell-game
which the U.S. Treasury Department and
the Federal Reserve are running
actually operates.
The Treasury Department signs Uncle Sams name to the
loss guarantees/guaranteed losses - irrevocably committing U.S. taxpayers to
covering the $10+ trillions in bad debts. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has
been spending the last three years stuffing $trillions in 0% loans into
the vaults of the Wall Street fraud-factories.
Of course, as anyone with
even a glimmer of brain-function will immediately realize, a 0% interest
loan is not a loanat all - merely a very thinly-disguised gift (i.e.
welfare). If one never has to pay interest on a loan, one simply
is never foolish enough to make any payments on that loan(s). So the Federal
Reserve has already given Wall Street
somewhere near $15 trillion to cover its guaranteed-losses (a sizable
down-payment on their total losses).
To finish the shell-game
(and the scam) over the next one/ten/twenty(?) years, the Treasury
Department will (very quietly) announce it is covering various Wall Street
losses - as per its guarantees. And (best of all) should Americans
belatedly decide to complain about their own economic rape, the welfare
on these guaranteed-losses is a fait accompli
- as the money is
already sitting in the banksters vaults (assuming they havent already
gambled-it away too).
And now these loss
guarantees (guaranteed losses) are being used to help complete the economic
rape of Europe.
We see exactly the same
pattern forming with Europes deadbeat-debtors as we saw in the U.S. with
the deadbeat-bankers. Hide and lie about the magnitude of losses. Attach
binding guarantees to those losses - which are nothing but
pre-approved hand-outs - and then plunder every last drop of wealth out of
these economies in (relatively) small installment payments. Just as the
math associated with the Wall Street welfare proves that these are
guaranteed losses rather than mere loss-guarantees, so too do the numbers
from Europe tell the same story.
After two years of fixing
and rescuing the economies of the Euro debt-sinners,
every one of
those economies is less-solvent today than it was when this
farcical process began - except for Iceland, which
refused to
capitulate to the banksters with its own loss-guarantees, and has thus
escaped from the banksters choke-hold.
Note that only part of the
problem here was the original losses caused by the crime-spree of Western
multi-national bankers. Much (most?) of the damage has in fact been caused
by the scorched-Earth austerity preached by economic neo-Nazi,
Milton
Friedman.
As the eminent Naomi Klein chronicled in her
critically-acclaimed body of work titled The
Shock Doctrine,
any/every economy exposed to Friedmans rape-and-pillage capitalism has
been destroyed by it.
The notable
exceptions
to this are the two champions of Friedmans fascist doctrine: the U.S./UK
Axis of Evil.
Klein first lays-out how these two disciples of this
sadistic ideologue were implementing his (literally) bankrupt policies on
one nation after another. Frequently, Friedmans economic rape was imposed
on its victims through overthrowing the legitimate democracies of these
nations; installing brutal, military dictatorships; and then torturing the
local populations into submission.
Economically, however, the chronologies
are all identical: total economic collapse.
Klein then notes how
Friedmans two, most-devoted crusaders, Ronald Reagan and Margaret
Thatcher refused to prescribe Friedmans toxic, fiscal medicine for
their own economies. Inadvertently, Reagan and Thatcher
exposed the entirely predatory nature of Friedmans vision:
Friedman-economics was something you perpetrated upon the masses,
so that a tiny core of economic elites could make themselves filthy-rich on
what they harvested from those masses.
In the case of the U.S. and
UK, they came to the reasonable conclusion (roughly 40 years ago) that if
they raped-and-pillaged a large enough number of
other economies
with Friedmans fascism that they would be able to loot enough to satisfy
their own greed - without needing to risk the bloodshed/anarchy/revolution
in their own nations which generally accompanies Friedman economics.
We see this harvesting
process fully underway in Greece, where the traitor-government has committed
itself to
selling-off any/all state assets coveted by the Oligarchs. The problem
for these greedy banksters and bond parasites is that they will have looted
every last drop of wealth from Greece long before they have satisfied the
mountain of debts under which they have buried Greece. Enter the loss
guarantees/guaranteed losses.
Greece may have absolutely
no possible way of ever paying-off these $100s of billions in debts (much
of it
fraudulent), but still-wealthy Germany can certainly be
blood-sucked enough to cover those losses. Having now seen these loss
guarantees from multiple perspectives, it becomes obvious what they really
symbolize: a yoke of economic slavery.
The problem with trying to
fashion such a yoke of slavery purely through piling one massive debt atop
another is obvious: at some point the mountain becomes too large, default
occurs - and the debts are swept clean (ending the slavery). In this
respect loss guarantees/guaranteed losses are a far superior means to engage
in long-term blood-sucking as they are literally blank cheques.
Each time one of these
debt-slave economies accumulates a little revenue in their coffers (or
rather is able to find a chump willing to lend them more money),
the banksters instruct their servants in government to fill-in one of the
blank cheques via covering a small portion of these guaranteed-losses.
Thus the loss-guarantees are designed to keep these economies perpetually on
the verge of bankruptcy, where the debt-slavery can be maximized
- without ever actually pushing one of the debt-slaves into formal default.
At this point many readers
may conclude that the banker Oligarchs and bond parasites have
already
devised the perfect rape of Europe. However, as was demonstrated by the
example of Iceland, these nations still retain enough sovereignty so that
they can choose to sever these chains of economic slavery. In
particular, the still relatively-wealthy economies of Northern Europe can
detach themselves from the loss guarantees for Southern Europe which are
intended to suck them dry.
The Oligarchs thus have one
more necessary step to irrevocably cement this campaign of economic slavery:
the full, economic integration of all Euro-zone economies.
In the final chapter of this series, I will look at the last/latest scheme
to permanently enslave the peoples of Europe with the Oligarchs' yokes of
debt.
Part IV
31 July 2011
In the first three
installments of this series I documented how U.S. economic terrorism had
been
unleashed on Euro-zone debt-markets, driving up their interest rates - and thus their deficits
- exponentially.
I then explained how the bankers
and bond parasites had exploited this increased indebtedness to attach
legal claims against the national gold-hoards
which these Euro-zone economies purportedly possess. Lastly, I pointed out
how the
"loss guarantees" being imposed on these debts (starting with Greece)
represented nothing less than perpetual debt-slavery.
In this final installment I
will discuss the last nail in the coffin for individual Euro states, and
their populations. The ultimate goal of these ruling Oligarchs is nothing
less than the full, economic integration of Europe.
Not only would this bind
every European citizen to the debts of all the individual Euro
states, but once full economic integration had been achieved then Europes
wealth could be plundered as a single entity - much more efficient than
their current nation-by-nation looting.
Naturally, this is not
something which would be welcomed or even tolerated by most
Europeans.
First of all, national identities remain strong within these
countries, and there is no desire for any greater degree of integration.
Secondly, the economic atrocities inflicted upon us by Western bankers over
the past three years have greatly exacerbated the regional economic
disparities within Europe. Simply, the Northern haves are adamantly
opposed to what they see as the subsidization of the Southern have
nots.
Conversely, the
banker-terrorists and bond Oligarchs are equally determined to impose a
single, economic entity on all of the peoples of Europe. This became utterly
imperative in the minds of these economic fascists in order to eliminate
the Iceland option.
Knowledgeable readers will
be aware that Iceland was initially a very eager pawn for the Western
multinational banksters at the beginning of this millennium. However, after
the Crash of 08 exposed these banksters as the international crime
syndicate we now know them to be, Iceland severed its ties with these
thugs-in-suits - renouncing the fraudulent debts which the banksters sought
to impose on the people of Iceland through loss guarantees.
At that point, the new
mantra of these Oligarchs became no more Icelands.
In part, this has been
achieved by tightening their economic choke-hold on individual Euro zone
economies - thus gaining added leverage on their weak, incompetent, and
traitorous governments.
The Oligarchs realized that they had been arrogant
and sloppy in their handling of Iceland - never dreaming that the government
of that tiny nation would be courageous enough to call their bluff and
simply walk away from all of that fraudulent debt. They now seek to
permanently eliminate the economic sovereignty of Euro states, ensuring
that no other European nation can escape from the fascist debt-slavery these
Oligarchs seek to impose.
The obvious question is: how
can this be achieved? With most Europeans firmly opposed to any greater
integration, and increasingly suspicious of the motives and actions
of their own governments, it is highly unlikely that any of the current
governments in Europe have the political capital to muscle-through such a
plan.
As with most of the
machinations of these villains, it is a multi-stage strategy. The first
stage is nearing completion: taking several Euro-zone economies as close as
possible to the brink of total economic collapse -
without
triggering outright bankruptcy/debt-default. The banksters realized that
this had been part of their mistake with Iceland.
At the time that they
sought to impose their massive loss guarantees on Iceland (which would
allow them to permanently blood-suck that economy),
Icelands underlying economy was still reasonably prosperous/stable. Thus it
was able to absorb the economic shock of walking away from the
banksters debts - and the penalty of being shut out of international debt
markets.
With Greeces economy now in
total ruin and Ireland, Portugal and likely Spain soon to follow, the
banksters want to make these economies so ridiculously over-leveraged with
debt, and debt-dependent that walking away would result in maximum
economic devastation. At this point, theres no reason to believe that they
will fail to do to the other three PIGS what they have now accomplished
with Greece.
The next stage of the plan
has already been launched, in the sense that the strategy is being openly
discussed (in order to create the right climate for the
final
stage). More and more bankers and Euro Zone officials are now proclaiming
that a
"Euro bond" represents the
Final
Solution for the Euro debt crisis.
In this respect, it is
extremely ironic how the word bond has two entirely different definitions.
On the one hand it can represent a pledge. On the other hand, it equally
represents a rope or chain used to restrain us.
By now, it is
hopefully apparent to readers that a Euro bond would entirely fall under
the latter definition.
The idea itself is that
Europe, as a whole, would issue a majority of its debt in these generic
Euro bonds which would be backed collectively, by all of
the economies of Europe. This would effectively blunt much of Wall Streets
current terrorist attacks in the individual debt-markets on these nations,
since such terrorism is perpetrated via the individual credit
default swap markets of the various sovereign Euro-zone economies - thus
driving up their interest rates.
A Euro bond would be tied
to the European Central Bank interest rate, and issued at only a tiny
fraction of the interest rates being inflicted upon individual European
economies by Wall Street. Thus the carrot being dangled before the eyes of
the Euro debt-sinners is that if they opt for a Euro bond it would
dramatically reduce their borrowing costs - nearly making these economies
solvent.
The banksters and bond
Oligarchs are also hoping this will be extremely attractive to the
more-solvent economies of Northern Europe, who are currently being called
upon to bankroll all of the bail-outs for the debt-sinners of the South.
Thus they will bombard the citizens of these northern European nations with
propaganda assuring them that once a Euro bond is a reality that the
Southern debt-sinners will cease to mooch any more loans from them.
Of course, as with any/every
supposedly benign action by the banksters and bond Oligarchs, this
supposed Final Solution is merely an illusion.
Obviously, about two
seconds after the first Euro bond was issued, Wall Street would wave its
magic wand, and instantly a credit default swap market would be created
for Euro bonds as well - within its private, totally unregulated derivatives
casino.
Instantly Wall Street would be able to drive-up interest rates on
the Euro bonds exactly as it is currently doing to these nations
individually.
All that creating a Euro
bond would accomplish is it would allow Wall Street to
simultaneously blood-suck all of Europe with a single terrorist attack.
To construct a simple analogy, you live in a house where terrorists are
planting a bomb outside your front door every day. Instead of putting a stop
to the terrorism, you simply move to the house next door - and naively
believe that the terrorist attacks will stop.
Except in this case it would
be like several terrorist-victims all moving into the
same
house, and believing themselves now to be safe, when all they have done
is make things even easier for the terrorists.
Putting aside the fact that
a Euro bond will worsen the debt-slavery of Europe rather than fix it, we
can be absolutely certain that the corporate propaganda machine will hail
the Euro bond as nothing less than the road to economic Utopia. In fact,
that is precisely how the banksters described the derivatives market itself,
when they first constructed their terrorist machinery.
Derivatives would magically
and permanently lower the borrowing costs for everyone, and simultaneously
lower the financial risks for everyone, and (totally
incidentally)
generate $trillions in profits for Western multinational banks. It was
nothing less than the economic equivalent of a perpetual motion machine,
except much less plausible. In fact the
only part
of that equation which has proved valid are the $trillions in bankster
profits.
Sadly, it will almost
certainly be an even easier sell with the Euro bond, since the
Disciples of Friedman are well aware that the mass-fear which their
economic carnage in Europe has generated will make their victims even more
pliant and open to suggestion then back when Europe enjoyed relative
prosperity and security.
In fact, the banksters are absolutely counting upon
the appeal of the Euro bond - since it is virtually their only lever to
obtain their final objective: the full, economic integration of
Europe.
It is the French who have
fired the first salvo here, on behalf of the banksters and bond parasites.
An anonymous spokesman for Frances President Sarkozy was
quoted by Bloomberg as asserting that it would not be possible to create
a Euro bond without closer integration of Europes fiscal and budgetary
regimes.
For over a year, we have
seen the EU essentially dictating terms to the Greek government in
return for doing nothing but piling additional billions in debts
atop the people of Greece. There has been no actual help provided
to Greece at all.
Clearly, if the EU is already able to impose its economic
will on individual nations (once they have been sufficiently softened up),
then the only way to create any closer integration of these economies is
simply to take away the rubber stamp currently held by individual
governments - the last remaining vestige of economic sovereignty.
As the Euro debt-sinners
continue to be squeezed in Wall Streets economic vise, we will see a
relentless propaganda campaign in the months ahead. One branch of the
propaganda will sanctify the creation of a Euro bond, while the other half
will lament that this Final Solution will only be available to the people
of Europe if they cede the last residue of their sovereignty.
Living on this side of the
Atlantic, its impossible for me to make even an educated guess at the final
outcome of this campaign to impose perpetual economic slavery on Europe.
The
fact that Europes various governments have not
already exposed and
renounced Wall Streets economic terrorism (via credit default swaps)
indicates that all of these Euro governments have been totally bought-off
through many years of massive bankster campaign-bribes.
Indeed, all of these servile
governments have shown themselves fully willing to impose
suicidal
Friedman austerity on their own people, and to heap infinite
trillions
in new debts onto the shoulders of their children and grandchildren. At the
same time, they have devotedly served their masters in
refusing to force the bond parasites to accept even a
penny of
debt forgiveness out of all their tens of trillions in fraudulent debts.
When I published my
first commentary early in 2009 on
this 21st
century neo-feudalism, I assumed that it would
begin with the U.S.
itself. With the U.S. economy already
much more insolvent than Europe, and with Americans much more thoroughly
brainwashed, I expected the Oligarchs to begin with the low-hanging fruit.
The more cosmopolitan
cultures of Europe, and their central location in the world in economic
and geographic terms has tended to generate a broader level of individual
awareness than the couch-potato societies of North America. This makes
Europe a much more difficult objective. However, it is now obvious that
their plan (perhaps altered after their failure with Iceland) is to
enslave Europe first.
The logical inference here
is that the Oligarchs fear that if they completed their plundering of the
U.S. economy and the economic enslavement of the American people first that
such an obvious example would make enslaving the less-pliant serfs of Europe
that much more difficult.
After more than a year and a half of concerted
terrorist attacks on European debt-markets, Europeans are now deemed ripe
to be the first (Western) victims of Friedmans economic fascism.
Should the Oligarchs be
successful in their European campaign, then the apathetic sheep of North
America meekly await their own fleecing.
