# New World Order - The Endgame Has Begun

Perhaps the single most important thing to
know about power
in the world today is that most nations do not have
control
over their own currencies.
Instead
privately owned, for-profit central banks - such as
the
Federal Reserve
Bank in the US - create money out of nothing
and then loan
it at interest to their respective governments
The nature of power in today's world
The central bank system
"Let me issue and control a nation's
money and I care not who writes the laws."
Amschel Rothschild
Perhaps the single most important thing to
know about power in the world today is that most nations do not have
control over their own currencies.
Instead privately owned, for-profit
central banks - such as the Federal Reserve Bank in the US - create
money out of nothing and then loan it at interest to their respective
governments. This is an incredibly profitable scam, but that's not the
worst of it.
Not only do the central banks have the power
to create money for free, they also have the power to set interest
rates, to decide how much credit is issued, and to decide how much money
is put into circulation.
With this power central banks can - and do - orchestrate boom and bust cycles, enabling the super-wealthy owners of
the banks to profit from investments during the booms, and buy up assets
at bargain prices during the busts.
And that still isn't the whole
story...
The most profitable of all central bank
activities has been the
financing of major wars, particularly the two
World Wars. When nations are engaged in warfare, with their very
survival at stake, the governments stretch their resources to the limit
in the competition to prevail.
The struggle to get more financing
becomes as important as the competition on the battlefield. Moneylenders
love a desperate borrower, and vast fortunes have been made by extending
credit to both sides in conflicts: the longer a war continues, the more
profit for the central bankers.
A very good introduction to the history of
central banking, and in particular
the Rothschild dynasty:
The Money Masters
(1996)
Centralized wealth leads to
centralized power
"Some of the biggest men in the
United States are afraid of something.
They know there is a
power somewhere, so organized, so subtle,
so watchful, so
interlocked, so complete, so pervasive
that they had better not
speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it."
Woodrow Wilson
Our political systems, based on parties
competing to get elected, are inherently prone to corruption.
Just as
the struggle for financing is important in military campaigns, so is it
important in political campaigns.
Wealthy donors are able to get special
treatment, when it comes to legislation and regulation that affects
their business interests. This kind of corruption, however, is only the
tip of the iceberg.
A more effective way that wealth translates
into power is by the placing of agents - individuals loyal to wealthy
backers - into positions of influence and power.
For example, when
the Rothschilds and
the Rockefellers joined forces to establish
the Federal
Reserve, they recruited an unknown professor, Woodrow Wilson, promised
to make him President, and secured a return promise that he would sign
the Federal Reserve bill when the time came.
With their influence over
party bosses, their
control of newspapers, and unlimited funding, they
were able to get Wilson elected. He
may have
later regretted his bargain with the devil, as suggested in the
above quotation.
A more modern example is Obama, long time
protégé of
Henry Kissinger, himself a key agent of the Rockefellers.
Like Wilson,
Obama appeared out of political nowhere, was rocketed into
the Presidency, and proved his loyalty in office. In Obama's case, this
involved promptly turning the White House over to central-banker agents
from Wall Street -
Timothy
Geithner and his buddies.
They make the policy; Obama makes the
speeches.
This kind of thing has been going on for
centuries, first in Europe and later in the US. What began as the
placement of a few key agents has evolved over time. What we have now is
an international web of control, with key agents placed in political
parties, governments and their agencies, the media, corporate boards,
intelligence services, and the military.
At the center of the web are
the central banking dynasties - the Gods of Money - who remain mostly
behind the scenes, pulling the
strands
of real power.
The engineering of
transformation
"In politics, nothing happens by
accident.
If it happens, you can bet it was
planned that way."
Franklin D. Roosevelt
Have you ever daydreamed about what you
would do, if you had wealth and power?
For some the answer might be a
life of leisure and indulgence, but for many their thoughts would turn
to changing the world, making the world 'better'.
An iconic example
would be Bill Gates, who would rather use the bulk of his fortune for
making changes in the world
-
primarily
to
do
with
population reduction - than devote it to amassing still more
wealth.
The Gods of Money are like that. They've had
wealth and power, in great excess, for generations, and unlike you and
me, they can do more than daydream.
The business they have been engaged
in for the past couple of centuries has not been to accumulate more
wealth, rather it has been to transform the world into their own desired
kind of private fiefdom. They have been accomplishing this in a series
of transformational projects on a global scale.
What is referred to as
'The New World Order' is simply the latest in this series of projects.
The Great America project
An ideal base of operations
When the American colonies achieved
independence from Britain, a new nation was created that clearly had the
potential to become a truly great world power.
A huge continent, bigger
than all of Europe, and with immense resources, was available to be
conquered and exploited. If the Rothschilds could gain control of
America, they could use it as a base of operations to consolidate their
power globally.
Building an industrial giant
During the1800s the US grew to become a
formidable industrial power.
We associate this rise to power with names
like,
-
Carnegie
-
Mellon
-
JP Morgan
-
Rockefeller,
...who came to be known
as the 'robber barons'.
However it was Rothschild money, and
Rothschild-linked banks, which played the major role in financing this
industrialization project. The Rothschilds were carefully preparing
their future base of operations.
JD Rockefeller was the greatest of the
robber barons, and he was able to join the Gods-of-Money pantheon on
more or less equal terms with the Rothschilds.
The Federal Reserve coup
With the US established as a major
industrial power, the next step was for the Gods of Money to take firm
control of this giant they had helped create. As described above, this
was accomplished, with the usual behind the scenes manipulations,
through the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.
The World War I project
The
next step was to play the European powers off against one another.
With
the backing of the Rothschilds, as described in
Hidden History, a secret cabal of British elites engineered the
'Great
War' with Germany, whose industrial and financial power was beginning to
eclipse that of the British Empire.
The cabal's intention was to
preserve British supremacy. The Gods of Money, however, were playing a
deeper game. Germany lost the war, but it was the US that emerged as the
main beneficiary, not Britain.
While the European powers were exhausting
themselves in warfare, the US was supplying them with the means to do
so, and those supplies were being paid for by loans made possible by the
new Federal Reserve - which had been established just in time for that
purpose. When the war ended, the European powers owed astronomical sums
to the US, and the US had greatly expanded its industrial capacity in
the process of supplying war materials.
Before the war, the US, Britain, and Germany
were more or less on a par as industrial powers. With only negligible
military involvement, the US emerged from the war as by far the greatest
industrial power, and the world's wealthiest nation as well.
But the US
was only one Great Power among many. It did not have a world-class fleet
nor did it have a world-class army.
The fascism and communism
experiments
The Grand Project of the Gods of Money has
always been, as mentioned above, to transform the world into their own
private fiefdom.
With their Great America project they were building the
geopolitical power base that would be needed to achieve that goal. But
there remained the question of how they would rule their fiefdom once
attained.
They want to have absolute control over the population, and
they wanted to experiment with different means of exercising such
control.
They saw their first opportunity to
experiment in the revolutionary ideas of Marx, Engels, Trotsky, and
Lenin. The Czarist regime was weakening, and had been forced, by the
1905 Revolution, to implement significant reforms. Weakened still
further by defeats early in World War I, a second communist revolution
had every probability of success.
There was a danger, however, that the
second revolution would lead to a democratic form of socialism, which
would not be the kind of regime the Gods of Money wanted for their
eventual fiefdom.
They saw in Lenin
and Trotsky leaders
with autocratic ideas that suited their purposes. They
arranged
for Lenin
to be
transported from Switzerland, and Trotsky from New York - both to St.
Petersburg -
where
they created the Bolshevik faction and took control of the
revolutionary aftermath.
The Gods
of Money then funded the development of the Soviet Union, and thus
launched an experiment with an autocratic regime based on collectivist
values.
The Gods of Money saw their second
opportunity to experiment in the ideas of the superbly charismatic
Adolph Hitler.
When Hitler was arrested for leading the Beer Hall Putsch
of 1923, they arranged for him to be given a comfortable jail existence
where he was able to develop his ideas in his magnum opus,
Mein Kampf,
which articulated a manifesto proposing, among other things, to seek
Lebensraum and enslave the Slavs.
Hitler's ideas centered around
nationalism, expansionism, racism, eugenics, genocide, and brutal
methods of population control.
If Hitler were to come to power in Germany,
that would provide an opportunity to experiment with a quite different
kind of autocratic regime. In addition, due to his expansionist ideas,
and his hatred of communism, it would provide the means to carry out
another project in geopolitical transformation, a second Great War.
Hitler was also attractive to German elites, who saw in him a chance to
restore Germany as a Great Power.
The rest, as they say, is history. By
engineering the economic collapse of the Weimar Republic, and by other
means, Hitler was indeed helped into power in Germany. He was no pawn
however, and much of his hatred, due in part to the fact that the
Rothschilds are Jewish, was aimed at the Gods of Money themselves, whom
he referred to as the 'Gnomes of Zurich'.
That hatred did not however
detract from the value of the Nazi experiment to the Gods of Money.
The World War II project
"If we see that Germany is winning we
should help Russia
and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany
and that way let them kill as many
as possible."
Harry S. Truman, NY Times, June
24, 1941
The next step in the Great America project
was to play all the other Great Powers off against one another, on a
grander scale than in the first Great War.
This time, however, the US
was to play a major military role, so that it could emerge from the war
as not just one more Great Power, but as the world's first global super
power. A major military role, yes, but a highly leveraged one, where the
US suffered negligible casualties compared to the astronomical
casualties of most of the other combatants.
From their secure American base of
operations, the Gods of Money helped arrange the rearmament of Germany
and the rapid rise of Japan as a modern industrial and military power,
while continuing to support the development of the Soviet Union. In this
way, as they say, the ducks were all lined up in a row.
The US then
pretended benevolent neutrality and watched while Japan fought it out
with China, and Germany fought it out with the Soviet Union.
The US bided its time and waited for the
most opportune moment to join the fray. When the time came, the US
systematically provoked Japan, and made no attempt to defend against the
attack on Pearl Harbor, even though Roosevelt knew the exact time the
attack was to occur.
The American people had been strongly against
entering the war, and Pearl Harbor, as planned, instantly transformed
public opinion, enabling the US to enter the war with the overwhelming
support of its people.
A 'Day of Infamy' indeed, but every
bit as much
Roosevelt's
as
Japan's.
Again, the rest is history. At the end of
the war the US had 40% of the world's wealth and industrial capacity,
dominance of the seven seas, permanent military bases spread around the
world, and a monopoly on nuclear weapons. Every other major power was
standing in rubble and drowning in debt, as intended.
With the US
established as the first global super power, the Gods of Money set out
to create a postwar world order to be dominated by America.
The postwar regime
Establishing the foundations for
a globalist state
In 1944, an international conference was
convened at Bretton Woods, establishing new globalist institutions,
including the UN,
IMF, and World Bank, according to a design that had
been worked during the war out by the Gods of Money's
Council on Foreign
Relations.
Under the guise of establishing a regime of world peace and
stability, the US arranged for the other Western powers to be
emasculated militarily. For its part, the US maintained and expanded its
military muscle.
The Cold War project
Whereas the Nazi experiment was terminated
by the war, the Soviet Union survived as a Great Power.
As the primary
wartime ally of America, and in light of the professed harmonious
intentions of the
Bretton Woods system, the Soviets were looking forward
to peaceful coexistence with the West, despite their considerable
ideological differences.
This was not to be, as it did not fit into the
plans of the Gods of Money, as they continued with their Grand Project
of global domination.
America and Britain, both firmly under the
thumb of the Gods of Money, invented the myth of a 'communist threat',
and proclaimed the Cold War, which served several purposes.
-
First, it
was accompanied by a policy of containment, which aimed to prevent the
Soviets, and their Chinese ideological cousins, from participating in
the postwar economic boom, and also in inhibiting nations, such as Korea
and Vietnam, from choosing to follow a socialist path.
-
Second, the Cold
War provided an excuse for the US to continue expanding its military
might and interventionist programs.
The collective imperialism
project
With the US as an unrestrained super power,
a Pax Americana regime prevailed in what was euphemistically
called the 'Free World'.
With no need to defend their separate empires,
the former European Great Powers were able to participate along with
America in a grand program of neo-imperialism. This led to the greatest
era of economic growth the world had ever seen.
Growth became the expected norm; any episode
of non-growth was considered an aberration. The expectation of growth
became a structural part of national economies, leading to routine
deficit financing, government borrowing, and increasing national debts - owed to the central banks.
There was no Plan B: if growth faltered
- a
dreaded recession episode - the only recourse was to borrow still more,
if an economy was to continue functioning.
Western prosperity and social
progress
The postwar growth boom led to unprecedented
prosperity throughout the West, as well as in Japan, which in the
postwar era could be considered part of the West.
In addition, sweeping
programs of social reform were introduced, such as the National Health
Service in the UK, and even more far-reaching welfare-state arrangements
throughout Western Europe.
Partly because of the dissolution of
traditional empires, and partly because of the social-reform measures,
there was a sense in the postwar world that democratic values were on
the rise. Governments were being more responsive to the needs and wishes
of the people. The Enlightenment values of personal freedom and the
rights of citizens were enshrined in the UN's
Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
It seemed as if a new golden age of democracy and
ever-improving social conditions had arrived.
Too good to be true
Economic stability plus everlasting economic
growth, along with peace guaranteed by a benevolent Uncle Sam: how sweet
it was!
With their postwar regime the Gods of Money had seduced the
'Free World' into a bubble of dependency. The UN Charter guaranteed the
principle of national sovereignty, and no one (exception: Charles de
Gaulle) seemed to realize that when someone else is guaranteeing your
sovereignty, you no longer have sovereignty.
Growth became the new
opiate of the people, and no one seemed to realize that everlasting
growth on a finite planet is a mathematical impossibility.
With most of the world willingly tied to a
leash of dependency on American leadership, and with America firmly
under the thumb of the Federal Reserve, the Gods of Money could now
proceed to lead the world down the garden path toward total subjugation.
The global destabilization project
Nixon and the gold standard
For nearly 30 years, from 1944 to 1971, the
Bretton Woods system operated more or less as advertised.
The dollar was
pegged to gold,
with
other currencies pegged to the dollar, providing the promised
financial stability. Growth continued, providing the expected prosperity
and rising living standards.
However, with the US embroiled in a costly
and unwinnable war in Vietnam, the American economy was beginning to
falter. In 1971, in order to continue financing the war, Nixon took the
dollar off the gold standard.
The Cold War project had provided an
opportunity to abandon the stability project. Currency values could now
fluctuate, enabling currency speculation, and introducing uncertainty
into the valuation of international transactions. No great harm resulted
at first, but a central pillar of financial stability had been removed.
Today, only a tiny percentage of currency transactions have to do with
the real economy, and the rest are rampant and destabilizing
speculation.
The Reagan-Thatcher revolution
In 1980 the Gods of Money moved their
destabilization project into a higher gear.
They arranged for their
agents, Reagan and Thatcher, to take leadership in the US and UK, and a
media propaganda campaign was launched to reintroduce the
long-discredited doctrine of laissez-faire economics, which had created
the
horrific Dickensian conditions of the Victorian era.
Based on a fraudulent economic analysis
promulgated by
Milton Friedman's Chicago School of Economics, the claim
was made that reducing corporate taxes and regulations would lead to a
stronger economy and benefits would accrue to all, including even
government budgets.
The charismatic Ronald Reagan talked about 'getting
government off our backs', and proclaimed that 'government is not the
solution; it is the problem'.
There is of course much truth in those
words, but increasing corporate power at the expense of government power
was not at all a path to either prosperity or to personal freedom. One
might have wondered how a career as a film actor and TV advertiser
qualified someone to be President, but the mystery vanishes when one
realizes that the main job of the President is to tell lies convincingly
to a credulous public, in support of the agendas of the Gods of Money.
Along with reducing corporate taxes and
regulations, the new economic policies included encouraging corporations
to move their operations to low-waged countries, which led to the
de-industrialization of both America and Britain.
The Bretton Woods
regime was being systematically undermined, and the decline of both
stability and prosperity was thus ensured.
The European Union project
The populations of continental Western
Europe, having experienced on their own doorsteps the ravages of fascism
and war, were less vulnerable to the kind of facile propaganda that
succeeded so well with the more sheltered populations of Britain and
America.
A more nuanced campaign was required to destabilize continental
Europe.
The propaganda campaign to sell the
Maastricht Treaty didn't talk about 'getting government off our backs',
which wouldn't have gone over very well in those economies, where the
welfare state was both popular and successful. Instead it was argued
that a European Union would put Europe on a par with the powerful USA,
and it was even argued that the EU was necessary to prevent future wars
among the European powers.
The reality of the EU was that it delivered
Europe directly into the hands of the Gods of Money. Unlike the European
nations themselves, which are governed by elected Parliaments and Prime
Ministers, the Brussels regime is dominated by the European Commission,
which is unelected and which the Gods of Money can easily arrange to be
staffed by their own selected agents.
A central part of the pro-EU propaganda
campaign had been promises about 'subsidiarity' - decisions were
allegedly to be taken at the lowest possible level, depending on the
issues involved: loss of sovereignty needn't be feared.
Brussels was to
make decisions only on matters that affected the EU as a whole.
Once the
EU was established, however, the term subsidiarity began to disappear
from usage, and over time more and more power has been shifted from
national governments to Brussels. Today, every aspect of life in the EU
is affected by reams of unreadable EU regulations.
The final nail in the coffin of European
national sovereignty, and financial stability, came with the adoption of
the Euro in 1999. Without the ability to control their own currencies,
nations had no real control over their financial viability. Today the
folly of a common currency, among nations with quite different economic
circumstances, is well covered in the financial press.
But the truth of
this folly was there from the beginning, and the Gods of Money were well
aware of it.
The Neoliberal Project and the
globalization of poverty
In 1994 the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) was signed by the US, Canada, and Mexico.
This treaty
undermined the economies and sovereignty of all three nations. Under the
guise of 'free trade', it was really about empowering corporations at
the expense of nations - the Reagan-Thatcher revolution on steroids.
Under such treaties corporations have the right to sue governments if
regulations undermine corporate profits.
Consumer safety, environmental
protection, and worker's rights are of little concern to the
corporate-controlled WTO process that renders judgments on such suits.
Since then a number of similar 'free trade zone' treaties have been
pursued involving various combinations of nations.
The Neoliberal Project got into high gear in
1995, with the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
The WTO
promptly launched a systematic campaign to increase the power of
corporations, by means of 'free trade' treaties that are binding on all
members of the WTO, including of course the EU. The overall effect of
the Neoliberal Project has been to lower living standards, undermine
national sovereignty, destabilize national finances, and in general to
destroy everything that the Bretton Woods system was designed to
protect.
In
the third world, particularly in sub-Sahara Africa, the ravages of the
Neoliberal Project have been extended still further by the actions of
the IMF and by other means - as documented by
John Perkins in
Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
Governments are encouraged, or forced, to take on
debts that they have no ability to repay.
When the governments then turn
to the IMF for relief, additional loans are granted, but they are
encumbered by draconian conditions. Governments are forced to cut social
services, and are required to sell off national assets, such as water
rights, at bargain basement prices to corporations.
It becomes illegal,
to give an example of what draconian means, for people to capture
rainwater, as that is deemed to be stealing from the corporations that
have bought the nation's water rights.
By such means poverty has been
systematically created wherever the IMF has managed to dig in its claws.
Destabilizing Enlightenment
values - the 'War on Terror'
On September 11, 2001 the Gods of Money
arranged for the controlled demolition of the World Trade Center, and
arranged also for that to be blamed on an imaginary Al Qaeda conspiracy
to 'destroy our freedoms'. In fact our freedoms have been destroyed - not by Al Qaeda, but by the Gods of Money themselves.
The Gods of Money were applying a lesson
learned from the Nazi experiment: the demolition of the World Trade
Center was a replay of the Reichstag Fire, which was also a false flag
event, blamed in that case on a 'communist conspiracy'.
Just as the
Reichstag Fire was followed by the Nazi's Enabling Act,
so 9/11 was
followed by
the Patriot Act.
Both Acts destroyed all constitutional
guarantees of civil liberties, leading in both cases to concentration
camps, the legitimization of torture, indefinite detention without legal
recourse, and the establishment of unaccountable police-state regimes.
Partly due to the psychological impact of
9/11, partly due to the hidden influence of the Gods of Money, and
partly due to additional
false-flag events (e.g. the 7/7 bombings in
London) governments everywhere have implemented 'anti-terrorist'
legislation that seriously undermines civil liberties that had long been
considered sacrosanct.
Destabilizing international law - 'justifiable' interventionism
Besides enabling the domestic curtailment of
civil liberties, the 'War on Terror' also became an excuse for military
interventionism - one excuse among many. In addition, we saw the
emergence of 'humanitarian interventions', and the fabrication of
excuses such as non-existent 'weapons of mass destruction'.
Such excuses
enabled the
wars against Iraq and Afghanistan.
Another interventionist tactic, used for
example in Kosovo
and Libya, has been the recruitment of mercenary
terrorists to play the role of 'domestic freedom fighters'. This then
provided an excuse for 'humanitarian' interventions.
In
the case of
Syria, mercenary terrorists have themselves been the primary means of
destabilization. One can hardly keep up with all the interventions. In
Africa, the US has set up AFRICOM, a military command established to
facilitate interventions and destabilization throughout Africa.
One can identify various geopolitical and
economic reasons for these various interventions, such as control over
energy and mineral resources.
However, from a big-picture perspective,
the overall effect has been to undermine the principle of national
sovereignty, and also to create a large number of 'failed states'.
Transforming economics - the
controlled demolition of capitalism
As
mentioned earlier, economic growth cannot continue forever on a finite
planet.
Quite clearly the capitalism/growth paradigm must come to an end
sooner or later. Based on these facts, many analysts have been
predicting the collapse of civilization. Some even see this as a good
thing, an opportunity to build a new society from the ground up.
Such analysts either don't understand the
degree to which power is centralized in today's world, or else they are
assuming those who have power are blind and stupid; the Gods of Money
are neither. They've been planning the successor to the growth paradigm
since the establishment of the Club of Rome in 1968, if not earlier.
Rather than letting capitalism collapse of its own accord, they've
arranged for a controlled collapse, so that they can fashion an outcome
of their own choosing.
The financial collapse of 2008 did not
happen by accident; it was a project, engineered by the Gods of Money.
There will be no recovery from the collapse because a recovery is not
intended. Instead of an economy based on market activity, we're to have
a globally micro-managed economy, as presaged by the widespread
deployment of 'smart meters'.
Lessons learned in the Soviet experiment
are to be applied globally.
The foundation for the 2008-collapse project
was the establishment of the 'mark-to-market' rule, also known as 'Basel
II'. This was an edict of the
Bank of International Settlements (BIS),
the central bank of central banks, with headquarters in Basel,
Switzerland. This rule requires banks to value their assets according to
what they could be sold for immediately on the markets.
What this means is that a temporary slump in
some asset value deflates the value of all related assets.
This is of
little concern in rising markets, but in any kind of serious downturn it
can render a bank insolvent unnecessarily. Markets do fluctuate, and
banks routinely ride out bumps in values. The mark-to-market rule means
that a survivable market bump can turn into a derailment: a time bomb
had been placed in the global financial system.
With this bomb in place, the stage was set
for the demolition project.
-
The first step,
arranged by Wall Street agents of the Gods of Money,- was the repeal of
the GlassSteagall Act. This gave Wall Street the freedom it needed to
proceed with the rest of the project.
-
Next, global credit lines were
opened wide, creating all kinds of loans that could never be repaid,
particularly in the US housing market. Those bad mortgages were then
bundled into derivatives, and phony insurance was attached so that the
derivatives could be given a triple-A rating. These toxic derivatives
were then marketed aggressively on global markets.
-
A housing bubble had been created; the toxic
derivatives spread the risk throughout the banking system, and the time
bomb ensured that when the bubble burst the banking system would be
rendered insolvent. In 2008 the bubble did burst, and the planned
insolvencies did immediately follow.
But that was not the worst of it.
If a bank, or any business, becomes
insolvent, the sensible thing to do is to place the business into
receivership and arrange for an orderly disposition of its assets and
liabilities.
What this means in the case of an insolvent bank is that
the bank can be closed down on a Friday, and re-opened on the Monday
under state ownership. The bad loans can be handed over to the unsecured
creditors, and normal banking operations can be resumed. The bank can
then be operated by the state, or it can be sold back into the private
sector.
As if this well-known, orderly procedure
didn't exist, the Gods of Money were able to promulgate a nonsense
doctrine called 'too big to fail'.
In order to help facilitate this
scam, compliant officials and media claimed that the banks were
suffering not from insolvency, but only from a temporary liquidity
crisis. Based on this lie, an insane program of bank bailouts was
launched.
Because the banks were insolvent, governments could not
possibly fulfill their fraudulently assumed bailout obligations. As
bailout payments became due, governments were forced to borrow to
fulfill them. The Gods of Money now had governments exactly where they
wanted them.
The outcome, as planned, was the
transformation of bank insolvency into government insolvency.
Governments got their needed loans, but with onerous conditions attached
- the same kind of conditions that the IMF had been attaching to loans
to third-world countries for decades.
Instead of the banks going into
receivership, governments were being forced into receivership, beginning
with those with the greatest bailout exposure...
-
Portugal
-
Ireland
-
Greece
-
Spain
The Gods of Money sent their agents
(troikas) into these countries, taking over control of national budgets.
A regime of austerity was decreed, guaranteeing that there could be no
economic recovery, and a sell-off of national assets began - at bargain
basement prices. Countries like France and Germany have been
economically strong enough to survive the initial assault, but as the
global economy continues to deteriorate they will eventually be pulled
into the trap of insolvency as well.
The more they try to save the Eurozone, the more they will be mired in debt. The US is already over
its head in debt, partly from bailouts, and partly for reasons of its
own such as military over-extension.
Throughout the West the following scenario
is being created:
rather than sovereign nations operating according to
market forces, we'll have nations that are owned by the Gods of Money,
operating on the basis of budgets allocated by the central banks.
The
goal of central governance will have been in practice achieved, by means
of debt, and a regime of economic micro-management will have been
achieved as well, as it already has been in the weaker economies.
The endgame - de-Americanization and
the empowerment of the UN
"The
Persian Gulf crisis is a rare opportunity to
forge new bonds with
old enemies (the Soviet Union)
Out of these troubled times a New
World Order can emerge
under a United Nations that performs as
envisioned by its founders."
President George Bush Sr. in his State of the Union
Address, January 29, 1991
Obama's back down in Syria - the
endgame begins
In the context of multiple interventions,
wars, drone strikes, etc., that the US, usually with the help of the UK,
routinely engages in - with little or no concern for international law,
public opinion, or consequences to civilians - it was extremely
surprising that first Cameron, and then Obama, abandoned their promise
to respond to Obama's 'red line', by referring the matter to Parliament
and Congress, where NO votes were all but certain to follow.
Not everyone recognized right away that a
momentous shift was signaled by this unprecedented back down, but the
magnitude of the shift soon became apparent to all as subsequent events
began to unfold.
The first remarkable follow-on event was the sudden
rise to diplomatic prominence of Vladimir Putin.
Even that was eclipsed
by the announcement that Washington and Iran were to engage in what
sounds like very promising face-to-face negotiations over the nuclear
issue, to the dire chagrin of Netanyahu, who up until then seemed to be
the tail wagging the American dog in the Middle East.
Such momentous shifts on a global scale do
not happen by accident, as we have seen in our whirlwind review of two
centuries of history.
Such
events must be interpreted in the context of the agenda of the
Gods of Money, and in particular with their Grand Project, to transform
the world into their own private fiefdom.
They've 'cleared the building
site' by destabilizing the world in the many ways described above, and
they've already begun to micromanage national budgets.
The time has
come, apparently, to get on with the formal installation of their New
World Order. Not by force, but by popular acclaim...
The sudden emergence of Putin as
a world leader
There has been a struggle going on for some
time between the US on the one hand, and Russia, China, and
the BRICS
nations on the other, regarding the latter's desire for a multi-polar
world, rather than a US-
dominated unipolar world.
The persistence of the dollar as a
reserve currency, and US exceptionalism in general,
have been of serious concern, and always the US has been jealous to
guard what it has seen as its legitimate prerogatives.
In the cases of Syria and Iran, for example,
appeals for sanity from Putin and others were ignored, or responded to
with traditional US arrogance.
Suddenly all that has changed. Putin in
particular has been elevated to the status of respected world leader,
and it would have been inconceivable only a few months ago that the US
would leave
Russia
in charge of dismantling Syria's chemical weapons.
Putin has not
changed his tune or his style; he's saying the same things he's always
been saying. What's changed is that now he isn't being dismissed by
Washington, and the global media, controlled of course by the Gods of
Money, is now featuring him in almost heroic terms.
Multipolarism has
become a reality overnight.
De-Americanization
American interventionism, and outrage
against it, is of course nothing new.
But particularly since 9/11 such
episodes have become more and more dangerous. With threats of war with
Iran, a 'pivot to the East' aimed against China, and other recent moves,
it seemed we were verging toward a situation that might even trigger a
full-blown nuclear confrontation on a global scale - the fulfillment of
the
ominous 'Project for a New American Century'.
The world, as we've been seeing in media
reports since the redline back down, is more than ready to embrace
de-Americanization. American leadership, widely welcomed after World War
II, has long-since passed out of favor.
One can almost hear a sigh of
relief, when reading some of the optimistic words of pundits in recent
days. And who could not be relieved by the turn of events we've seen
since Washington no longer seems to be calling all the shots?
When Obama
speaks, we typically hear the rhetoric of a politician; when Putin
speaks, we hear the reasoned words of an astute statesman.
The empowerment of the UN
It does not take much imagination to see
where these developments are heading.
Diplomacy is taking center stage,
and new voices are being heard in the discourse of the 'international
community'. Expectations are rising that long-standing tensions and
long-simmering crises may finally become resolvable.
As real results
begin feeding into these expectations, as will happen when the Iran
crisis is settled, and when the media starts saying the right things,
there will emerge what amounts to a public outcry to carry this progress
forward, to make sure that reason and diplomacy become the norm in
international relations.
Out of the created crisis of American
exceptionalism, we will be treated with a 'solution' - putting teeth
into the UN process. No more American vetoes in defiance of global
sentiment! No more American (or Israeli) military adventurism!
Let
the
United Nations do the job it was designed to do, we will hear, to provide a forum
where issues can really be resolved, and to have the ability to carry
out the resulting decisions on the ground. A 'reformed' UN won't be
called a world government, but the kinds of powers granted by the 'reforms' will amount to the same thing.
The word subsidiarity may
emerge again, if needed to silence dissenting voices, but as with the EU
such assurances would be meaningless.
UN as Trojan Horse
"Childbearing should be a punishable
crime against society,
unless the parents hold a government license.
All potential parents should be required to use contraceptive
chemicals,
the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for
childbearing."
David Brower, first Executive Director of the Sierra
Club
It is important to notice that these recent
breakthroughs and shifts are all in the realm of geopolitics.
In this
push toward centralized governance all attention is being focused on war
and peace issues. Everyone, presumably, wants peace and stability among
nations. We are being offered an attractive wooden horse named Peace,
and we're not hearing much about what's inside the horse.
Beware of
elites bearing gifts.
In fact we know quite a bit about what is
carried within the horse, but I've space here for only an example or
two.
Agenda 21 is one of the most frightening pieces of cargo the horse is
carrying.
This agenda starts with legitimate concerns regarding
sustainability, and transforms them into a Green Monster that aims to
micromanage every aspect of our lives, to an extent that makes the old
Soviet regime seem almost like free enterprise by comparison.
Anyone not
familiar with Agenda 21 would be well advised
to do some research.
And even in the realm of international
relations, there are some frightening indicators, in particular
regarding drone strikes. One would hope those diabolic machines would be
outlawed altogether, if we're moving toward a more harmonious world.
But
no, already the United Nations is considering the drone issue, and wants to set up
some kind of rating system, to distinguish good strikes from bad
strikes.
Which brings up the whole question of
'terrorism'. As I've claimed above, and the evidence really is decisive,
much of what is called 'terrorism' is really either false-flag
operations, or else the acts of mercenaries working for Western
intelligence agencies, in the pursuit of some destabilization or
regime-change project.
If the pretense is to continue - in our
diplomacy-based world - that all this 'terrorism' is real, and that
civil liberties must continue to be sacrificed, then our wooden horse
isn't as attractive as it might first appear.
There are two things we can be sure of,
regarding what comes with our wooden horse:
-
First, the UN will end up
micro-managing society, by means of unaccountable bureaucracies, like
the IMF, IPCC, WHO, etc.
-
Second, with so many of our traditional systems
intentionally destabilized, we can expect that a 'solution' will be
given to us, in terms of a new cultural and economic paradigm.
In an
earlier article (The Elite Plan for a New World
Social Order), I've gone into some detail as to the kinds of cultural changes the
Gods
of Money most likely have in
store
for us, based on various available indicators.
