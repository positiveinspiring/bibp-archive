The
White House and State Department have engaged in brazen lying to
EU governments regarding the ability of the US to supply more
than enough natural gas to replace Russian gas deliveries.
Recent statements by US President Obama and Secretary of State
John Kerry are so patently false that it betrays an incredible
desperation in Washington over the situation in Ukraine versus
Moscow. Or it suggests that Washington is so out of touch with
any factual reality she simply doesnt care what she says.
Either way, it suggests an unreliable diplomatic partner for the
EU.
After his recent meeting with EU leaders
Obama
issued the incredible statement that
the secret Transatlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership (TTIP) that is being secretly negotiated behind
closed doors by the major private multinational companies would make it
easier for the United States to export gas to Europe and help it reduce its
dependency on Russian energy:
"Once we have a trade agreement in place,
export licenses for projects for liquefied natural gas destined to
Europe would be much easier, something that is obviously relevant in
todays geopolitical environment," Obama
stated.
That bit of political opportunism to try
to push the stalled TTIP talks by playing on EU fears of Russian gas loss
after the US-orchestrated Ukraine coup of February 22, ignores the fact that
the problem in getting US shale gas to the EU does not lie in easier LNG
licensing procedures in the USA and EU.
In other recent statements, referring to the
recent boom in unconventional US shale gas, Obama and Kerry have both stated
the US could more than replace all Russian gas to the EU, an outright lie
based on physical realities.
At his Brussels meeting Obama told EU leaders
they should import shale gas from the US to replace Russian. There is a huge
problem with that.
Shale
revolution a failure
Number one, the "shale gas revolution" in the
USA has failed.
The dramatic rise in US natural gas production from
"fracking" or forcing gas out of shale rock formations is being abandoned by
the largest energy companies like Shell and BP as uneconomical.
Shell has
just announced a huge reduction of its exposure to US shale gas development.
Shell is selling its leases on some 700,000 acres of shale gas lands in the
major shale gas areas of Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Kansas and says
it may have to get rid of more to stop its shale gas losses.
Shells CEO, Ben
van Beurden stated,
"Financial performance there is frankly not acceptable
some of our exploration bets have simply not worked
out."
A useful summary of the shale gas illusion comes
from a recent analysis of the actual results of several years of shale gas
extraction in the USA by veteran energy analyst David Hughes.
He notes,
"Shale gas production has grown explosively to account for nearly 40 percent
of US natural gas production.
Nevertheless, production has been on a plateau
since December 2011; eighty percent of shale gas production comes from five
plays, several of which are in decline.
The very high decline rates of shale
gas wells require continuous inputs of capital - estimated at $42 billion per
year to drill more than 7,000 wells - in order to maintain production. In
comparison, the value of shale gas produced in 2012 was just $32.5
billion."
So Obama is either being lied to by his
advisers on the true state of US shale gas supplies, or he is willfully lying. The former is most likely.
The second problem with the US "offer" of gas to
the EU to replace Russian gas is the fact that it requires massive, costly
infrastructure in the form of construction of new Liquefied Natural Gas
terminals that can handle the huge LNG supertankers to bring it to similar
huge LNG terminal harbors in the EU.
The problem is that owing to various US laws on
export of domestic energy and supply factors, there exist no operating LNG
liquefaction terminals in the US. The only one now under construction is the
Sabine Pass LNG receiving terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, owned by
Cheniere Energy, where
John Deutch, former CIA head, sits on the board.
The
problem with the Sabine Pass LNG terminal is that most of the gas has been
pre-contracted to Korean, Indian and other Asian LNG customers, not to the
EU.
The second problem is that even were a
huge port capacity installed to satisfy EU gas needs to replace Russian
supplies, that would push domestic natural-gas prices higher and cut short
the mini-manufacturing boom fueled by abundant, cheap shale gas. The
ultimate cost to EU consumers of US LNG would have to be far more than
current Russian gas pipelined over Nord Stream or Ukraine.
The next problem
is that the specialized LNG supertankers do not exist to supply the EU
market. All this takes years, including environmental approvals,
construction time, perhaps seven years on average in best conditions.
The EU gets some 30% of its gas, the
fastest-growing energy source there, from Russia today.
In 2007, Russias Gazprom supplied 14 percent for France, 27 percent for Italy, 36 percent for
Germany, with Finland and the Baltic states receiving as much as 100 percent
of gas imports from
Russia.
The EU has no realistic alternative to
Russian gas. Germany, the largest economy, has foolishly decided to phase
out nuclear power and its "alternative energy" - wind power and solar
- is an
economic and political disaster with consumer electricity costs exploding
even though alternatives are a tiny share of the total market.
In short, the chimera of shutting Russian gas
and turning on US gas instead, is economic, energy and political nonsense.
