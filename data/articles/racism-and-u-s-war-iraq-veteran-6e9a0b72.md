# Racism and U.S. War - Iraq Veteran

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_waronterror29.htm

When I first joined the army, we were told
that racism no longer existed in the military.
A legacy of inequality and discrimination
was suddenly washed away by something called "Equal Opportunity." We
would sit through mandatory classes, assuring us that racism had been
eliminated from the ranks, and every unit had its own EO representative
to ensure no elements of racism could resurface. The Army seemed firmly
dedicated to smashing any hint of racism.
And then Sept. 11 happened. I began to hear new words like "towel head,"
"camel jockey" and - the most disturbing - "sand nigger." These words
did not initially come from my fellow soldiers, but from my superiors -
my platoon sergeant, my company first sergeant, my battalion commander.
All the way up the chain of command, viciously racist terms were
suddenly acceptable.
I noticed that the most overt racism came from veterans of the first
Gulf War. Those were the words they used when they were incinerating
civilian convoys. Those were the words they used when this government
deliberately targeted the civilian infrastructure, bombing water
supplies knowing that it would kill hundreds of thousands of children.
Those were the words the American people used when they allowed this
government to sanction Iraq - and this is something many people forget.
Weve just learned that weve killed over 1
million Iraqis since the invasion; we had already killed a million
Iraqis before the invasion throughout the 90s through bombings and
sanctions.
Haji was the
enemy
When I got to Iraq in 2003, I learned a new word - "Haji."
Haji was the enemy. Haji was every Iraqi. He
was not a person, or a father, or a teacher, or a worker. But where does
this word come from? Every Muslim strives to take a pilgrimage to Mecca,
called a Haj. A Muslim who has completed that pilgrimage is a Haji. It
is something that, in traditional Islam, is the highest calling in the
religion - essentially, the best thing for a Muslim made into the worst
thing.
But history did not start with us. Since the creation of this country,
racism has been used to justify expansion and oppression. The Native
Americans were called savages. The Africans were called all sorts of
things to excuse slavery. A multitude of names were used during Vietnam
to justify that imperialist war.
So Haji was the word we used on this mission. Weve heard a lot about
raids during Winter Soldier, kicking down peoples doors and ransacking
their homes. But this mission was a different kind of raid. We never got
any explanation for these orders, we were only told that this group of
five or six houses were now property of the U.S. military. We had to go
in and make those people leave those houses.
So we went to these houses and told the people that their homes were no
longer their homes. We provided them no alternative, no place to go, no
compensation. They were very confused and scared, and would not leave -
so we had to remove them from their houses.
There was one family in particular that stands out: a woman with two
young daughters, an elderly man who was bed-ridden and two middle-aged
men. We dragged them from their houses and threw them onto the street.
We arrested the men for not leaving and sent them to prison with the
Iraqi police.
At that time I didnt know what happened to Iraqis when we put a sandbag
over their head and tied their hands behind their back; unfortunately, a
couple months later, I had to find out.
Our unit was short interrogators, so I was
tasked to assist with interrogations.
A detainees
ordeal
First, Id like to point out that the vast majority of detainees I
encountered had done nothing wrong. They were arrested for things as
simple as being in the area when an IED went off, or living in a village
where a suspected insurgent lived.
I witness and participated in many interrogations; one in particular Id
like to share. It was a moment for me that helped me realize the nature
of our occupation.
This detainee who I was sent to interrogate was stripped down to his
underwear, hands bound behind his back and a sandbag on his head - and I
never actually saw his face. My job was to take a metal folding chair,
and as he was standing face-first against the wall, I was to smash the
chair next to his head every time he was asked a question. A fellow
soldier would yell the same question over and over, and no matter what
he answered, I would smash the chair next to his head.
We did this until we got tired, then I was told to make sure he stayed
standing facing the wall. By this time he was in an extremely broken
state - he was shaking uncontrollably, he was crying, and he was covered
in his own urine.
I was guarding him, but something was wrong with his leg - he was
injured and kept falling to the ground. My sergeant told me to make sure
he stayed standing, so I would have to pick him up and slam him against
the wall. He kept falling down so Id have to keep picking him up and
forcefully putting him against the wall.
My sergeant came by, and was upset that he was on the ground again, so
he picked him up and slammed him against the wall several times - and
when the man fell to the ground again I noticed blood pouring down from
under the sandbag.
So I let him sit, and whenever my sergeant starting coming I would warn
the man and tell him to stand. It was then that I realized that I was
supposed to be guarding my unit from this detainee, but what I was doing
was guarding this detainee from my unit.
I tried hard to be proud of my service.
All I could feel was shame.
Face of occupation
is laid bare
Racism could no longer mask the reality of the occupation. These were
people. These were human beings.
I have since been plagued by guilt - anytime
I see an elderly man, like the one who couldnt walk, who we rolled onto
a stretcher and told the Iraqi police to take him away. I feel guilt
anytime I see a mother with her children, like the one who cried
hysterically, and screamed that we were worse than Saddam as we forced
her from her home. I feel guilt anytime I see a young girl, like the one
I grabbed by the arm and dragged into the street.
We were told we were fighting terrorists. The real terrorist was me. The
real terrorism is this occupation.
Racism within the military has long been an important tool to justify
the destruction and occupation of another country. It has long been used
to justify the killing, subjugation, and torture of another people.
Racism is a vital weapon employed by this government. It is a more
important weapon that a rifle, or a tank, or a bomber, or a battleship.
It is more destructive than an artillery shell, or a bunker buster, or a
tomahawk missile.
While all those weapons are created and owned by this government, they
are harmless without people willing to use them. Those who send us to
war do not have to pull a trigger or lob a mortar round; they dont have
to fight the war, they merely have to sell us the war.
They need a public who is willing to send
their soldiers into harms way, and they need soldiers who are willing
to kill and be killed, without question. They can spend millions on a
single bomb - but that bomb only becomes a weapon when the ranks in the
military are willing to follow the orders to use it. They can send every
last soldier anywhere on earth, but there will only be a war if soldiers
are willing to fight.
The ruling class - the billionaires who profit from human suffering, who
care only about expanding their wealth and controlling the world economy
- understand that their power lies only in their ability to convince us
that war, oppression, and exploitation is in our interest. They
understand that their wealth is dependent on their ability to convince
the working class to die to control the market of another country.
And convincing us to die and kill is based
on their ability to make us think that we are somehow superior.
Soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen have nothing to gain from this
war. The vast majority of people living in the United States have
nothing to gain from this war. In fact, not only do soldiers and workers
gain nothing from this occupation, but we suffer more because of it. We
lose the limbs, endure the trauma and give our lives. Our families have
to watch flag-draped coffins lowered into the earth.
Millions in this country without health
care, jobs, or access to education must watch this government squander
over $400 million a day on this war.
The real enemy is
here
Poor and working people in this country are sent to kill poor and
working people in another country, to make the rich richer.
Without racism, soldiers would realize that
they have more in common with the Iraqi people than they do with the
billionaires who send us to war. I threw people onto the street in Iraq,
only to come home and find families here thrown onto the street in this
tragic and unnecessary foreclosure crisis that is already leaving
hundreds of Iraq war veterans homeless.
We need to wake up and realize that our real enemies are not in some
distant land; theyre not people whose names we dont know and whose
cultures we dont understand.
The enemy is people we know well and people
we can identify - the enemy is the system that sends us to war when its
profitable; the enemies are the CEOs who lay us off from our jobs when
its profitable; theyre the insurance companies who deny us health care
when its profitable; theyre the banks that take away our homes when
its profitable.
Our enemies are not 5,000 miles away.
They are right here at home, and if we
organize and fight with our sisters and brothers we can stop this war,
stop this government, and create a better world.
