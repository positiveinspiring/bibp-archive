One of the more offensive duties of being an investigative journalist is
taking out the trash - exposing liars, fraudsters, con artists and scammers
for the people they truly are.
Each time we investigate a sociopath, we find
that they always have a little cult group following of spellbound
worshippers who consider that particular sociopath to be a "guru" or
"prophet."
Sociopaths are masters at influence and deception. Very little of what they
say actually checks out in terms of facts or reality, but they're extremely
skillful at making the things they say sound believable, even if they're
just making them up out of thin air.
Here, I'm going to present quotes and videos of
some legendary sociopaths who convinced everyday people to participate in
mass suicides. And then I'm going to demonstrate how and why similar
sociopaths are operating right now... today.
Why cover this subject?
I've seen a lot of people get hoodwinked, scammed or
even harmed by sociopaths, and it bewilders me that people are so easily
sucked into their destructive influence. I want to share with
readers the warning signs of sociopaths so that you can spot them, avoid
them, and save yourself the trouble of being unduly influenced by them.
Much of this information is derived from the fascinating book,
The Sociopath Next Door,
which says that 4% of the population are sociopaths.
The book is a fascinating read.
10 signs for spotting
a sociopath
-
Sociopaths are charming. Sociopaths have
high charisma and tend to attract a following just because people
want to be around them. They have a "glow" about them that attracts
people who typically seek guidance or direction. They often appear
to be sexy or have a strong sexual attraction. Not all sexy people
are sociopaths, obviously, but watch out for over-the-top sexual
appetites and weird fetishes.
-
Sociopaths are more spontaneous and
intense than other people. They tend to do bizarre, sometimes
erratic things that most regular people wouldn't do. They are
unbound by normal social contracts. Their behavior often seems
irrational or extremely risky.
-
Sociopaths are incapable of feeling
shame, guilt or remorse. Their brains simply lack the circuitry to
process such emotions. This allows them to betray people, threaten
people or harm people without giving it a second thought. They
pursue any action that serves their own self interest even if it
seriously harms others.
-
Sociopaths invent outrageous lies about
their experiences. They wildly exaggerate things to the point of
absurdity, but when they describe it to you in a storytelling
format, for some reason it sounds believable at the time.
-
Sociopaths seek to dominate others and
"win" at all costs. They hate to lose any argument or fight and will
viciously defend their web of lies, even to the point of logical
absurdity.
-
Sociopaths tend to be highly
intelligent, but they use their brainpower to deceive others rather
than empower them. Their high IQs often makes them dangerous. This
is why many of the best-known serial killers who successfully evaded
law enforcement were sociopaths.
-
Sociopaths are incapable of love and are
entirely self-serving. They may feign love or compassion in order to
get what they want, but they don't actually FEEL love in the way
that you or I do.
-
Sociopaths speak poetically. They are
master wordsmiths, able to deliver a running "stream of
consciousness" monologue that is both intriguing and hypnotic. They
are expert storytellers and even poets.
As a great example of this
in action, watch this interview of Charles Manson:
-
Sociopaths never apologize. They are
never wrong. They never feel guilt. They can never apologize. Even
if shown proof that they were wrong, they will refuse to apologize
and instead go on the attack.
-
Sociopaths are delusional and literally
believe that what they say becomes truth merely because they say it!
Charles Manson, the sociopathic murderer, is famous for saying,
"I've never killed anyone! I don't need to kill anyone! I THINK it!
I have it HERE! (Pointing to his temple.) I don't need to live in
this physical realm..."
Watch Charles Manson saying this at the 3:05 mark on
above video.
How to dispel illusion
and get to the truth
Sociopaths are masters at weaving elaborate fictional explanations to
justify their actions.
When caught red-handed, they respond with anger and
threats, then weave new fabrications to explain away whatever they were
caught doing.
A sociopath caught red-handed with a suitcase full of cash he just stole,
for example, might declare he had actually rescued the money from being
stolen by someone else, and that he was attempting to find its rightful
owner. He's the hero, see?
And yet, in reality, he will simply pocket the
money and keep it. If you question him about the money, he will attack you
for questioning his honesty.
Sociopaths are masters are presenting themselves as heroes with high morals
and philosophy, yet underneath it they are the true criminal minds in
society who steal, undermine, deceive, and often incite emotional chaos
among entire communities.
They are masters at turning one group of people
against another group while proclaiming themselves to be the one true
savior. Wherever they go, they create strife, argument and hatred, yet they
utterly fail to see their own role in creating it. They are delusional at so
many levels that their brains defy logical reasoning. You cannot reason with
a sociopath.
Attempting to do so only wastes your time and
annoys the sociopath.
Tip for exposing
sociopaths
Start fact-checking something they claim
One simple method for dispelling sociopathic delusion is to start fact
checking their claims.
Do any of their claims actually check out? If
you start digging, you will usually find an inconsistency. Confront the
suspected sociopath with the inconsistency and see what happens: Most
sociopaths will become angry or aggressive when their integrity is
questioned, whereas a sane person would simply be happy to help clear up any
misinformation or misunderstanding.
Beware of fact-checking the sociopath by asking other people under his or
her influence. A sociopath will usually have a small group of cult-like
followers who not only believe their fictional tales, but who actually
internalize those fictions to the point where they rewrite their own
memories to be consistent with them.
If a guru-style sociopath talks about his
"levitation sessions" over and over again, some of his believers will sooner
or later start to form false memories in which they imagine seeing him
levitate off the floor.
So if you ask those people,
"Did you actually ever see this person
levitate?"
They will enthusiastically say, "Yes!",
because
in their own minds, that illusion has become something indistinguishable
from a vivid memory.
That's why fact-checking a sociopath requires evidence from outside his
circle of influence. Does anything he say actually check out in the real
world, outside his sphere of direct control?
If not, you've probably spotted
a sociopath.
Sociopaths never
answer facts
They always attack the messenger
Another very valuable red flag to recognize when trying to spot a sociopath
is to see how they deal with attacks on their own integrity.
If a sociopath is presented with a collection of
facts, documents and evidence showing that he lied or deceived, he will
refuse to address the evidence and, instead, attack the messenger!
As an investigative journalist who exposes some of the most despicable
sociopaths on the planet, I've been attacked on every front imaginable:
I'm
a secret government agent, they say. Or I'm an alien from planet Zorg.
I've
heard it all, and while the accusations vary wildly, the pattern is the
same:
Attack the messenger but refuse to answer the documented allegations.
If you really try to nail a sociopath down to answering a documented
allegation, they will quickly turn on you, denounce you, and declare that
you too are secretly plotting against them.
Anyone who does not fall for the brainwashing of
the sociopath is sooner or later kicked out of the circle and then wildly
disparaged by the remaining members of the cult group.
Inventing bizarre
tales
One of the easiest signs to spot is how sociopaths exaggerate things to an
irrational absurdity. In the sociopath's world, every explanation is more
intense and more heroic-sounding than the way it really went down.
Where a normal person might say,
"I vomited last night," a sociopath would
say, "I vomited up a 27-foot tapeworm!"
And a truly psychotic sociopath might even add
details such as,
"And then the tapeworm climbed up the wall
and jumped on me and tried to strangle me!"
You might laugh at such an explanation, but I
know lots of similar examples that have been believed by irrational cult
followers.
Every story the sociopath weaves, often on the spur of the moment, is
impossible to either confirm or deny.
No one can prove him wrong, since they
weren't there, so he can spin whatever details into the story he wants.
"After eating this, I had a three-hour
ejaculation!" Or, "The Dalai Lama wanted to anoint me as a spiritual
leader, but I declined, telling him that I only needed faith, not any
official recognition."
How can anyone disprove such a claim? They
can't.
So the sociopaths relies on these un-provable,
unsubstantiated claims to build up a false aura of authority, spirituality
or knowledge. This creeps up on followers like a serpent, slithering into
their brains and taking hold of their belief systems before they realize
what has happened.
As a survivor of the Jim Jones "Jonestown" mass suicide says in a PBS
documentary video (see link below),
"Everything was plausible [at the time],
except in retrospect the whole thing seems bizarre."
That's how sociopaths operate.
As they're
speaking, they capture your imagination and sound reasonable, even
authoritative. But in the clear light of day, what they are actually saying
is absurd... even dangerous.
But no matter what fictions are presented by the sociopath, they always
present him in the light of a hero - sometimes even a saint - who sacrifices
his life for the good of others. He often talks of "healing" or
"detoxification" or being "cleansed."
When he is exposed by truth-tellers, he merely
accuses the truth-tellers of being secret undercover agents. When he is
accused of sexual assault by one of his own followers (a common occurrence
in these circles), he denounces her as an enemy or a spy.
The ultimate destination of a sociopath is to destroy himself and take as
many willing victims with him as possible.
This is the Jim Jones scenario: Drink the
Kool-Aid laced with poison, and thereby prove your worth to your entire cult
group.
A common theme of
poison, sainthood, redemption
Interestingly, many sociopaths do indeed center their actions around a
bizarre food or drink theme, often demanding their members eat or drink
poisonous or highly offensive substances that no rational person would
otherwise consume.
The
Heaven's Gate cult, for example, was led by
a classic sociopath named
Marshall Applewhite. He managed to convince 38
followers to kill themselves by eating applesauce laced with phenobarbital.
Watch the fascinating video of Applewhite here and ask yourself: Would you
follow this man to your own grave? (Other people did!)
Notice how Applewhite speaks with authority, clarity and some level of
charisma.
Notice the intensity of his eyes? This is another common trait
among sociopaths (including Manson, above). Remember, this man gained such
influence over his followers that they voluntarily killed themselves in
order to maintain his approval!
As Wikipedia
explains:
On March 19-20, 1997, Marshall Applewhite taped himself speaking of mass
suicide and asserted,
"it was the only way to evacuate this
Earth."
The Heaven's Gate group was against suicide but
they believed they had no choice but to leave Earth as quickly as possible.
After claiming that a space craft was trailing
the comet Hale-Bopp, Applewhite convinced 38 followers to commit suicide so
that their souls could board the supposed craft. Applewhite believed that
after their deaths, a UFO would take their souls to another "level of
existence above human," which Applewhite described as being both physical
and spiritual.
This and other UFO-related beliefs held by the
group have led some observers to characterize the group as a type of UFO
religion. In October 1996, the group purchased alien abduction insurance to
cover up to 50 members at a cost of $10,000.
The cult rented a 9,200-sq.-ft. mansion, located at 18241 Colina Norte
(later changed to Paseo Victoria), in a gated community of upscale homes in
the San Diego-area community of Rancho Santa Fe, California from Sam
Koutchesfahani, paying $7,000 per month in cash.
The thirty-eight Heaven's Gate members, plus
group leader Applewhite, were found dead in the home on March 26, 1997.
In
the heat of the California spring, many of the bodies had begun to decompose
by the time they were discovered. The corpses underwent autopsies, where
cyanide and arsenic were found. The bodies were later cremated.
The suicide was accomplished by ingestion of phenobarbital mixed with
applesauce or pudding, washed down with vodka. Additionally, plastic bags
were secured around their heads after ingesting the mix to induce
asphyxiation. Authorities found the dead lying neatly in their own bunk
beds, faces and torsos covered by a square, purple cloth.
Each member carried a five-dollar bill and three
quarters in their pockets.
All 39 were dressed in identical black shirts
and sweat pants, brand new black-and-white Nike Decades athletic shoes, and
armband patches reading "Heaven's Gate Away Team" (one of many instances of
the group's use of the Star Trek fictional universe's nomenclature).
The
adherents, between the ages of 26 and 72, are believed to have died in three
groups over three successive days, with remaining participants cleaning up
after each prior group's death.
This episode speaks directly to the mind-altering power of sociopaths.
Their delusions can be so convincing that
followers will even kill themselves in order to stay in alignment with the
expectations of the group. I know of a fringe health sociopath operating
right now who has killed several of his own followers, but of course he
always blames them for their own deaths. It's never his fault, you see.
Sadly, even when one sociopath kills himself (and takes a few of his
followers with him), there is always another sociopath waiting to take his
place, seeking power, influence, and sometimes fame. It is common for
sociopaths to strongly desire to be on television shows or to desperately
seek out opportunities for short-term fame, often from engaging in bizarre
acts or staging strange events.
This is one of the ways in which they recruit
followers to join their cult.
Jim Jones and drinking
the Kool-Aid
The most horrifying master of sociopathic delusion was, of course,
Jim Jones
who convinced 900+ people to kill themselves by drinking poisoned Kool-Aid.
And people loved him for it! They felt inspired, excited, healed and guided.
Jim Jones was their savior, their prophet. They believed his every word, and
they paid for their foolish belief with their lives.
Watch this powerful PBD documentary video about Jonestown:
As Jim Jones proved, people can be easily swept up into an irrational belief
in a guru or prophet who quite
literally plans to murder them.
This is the other dominant factor we see in dangerous sociopaths:
An odd
obsession with dead things, rotting things, putrid things... things that
would cause a normal, mentally balanced person to shrink away in horror.
Jim
Jones, for example, was fascinated with death and would reportedly murder
small animals and then hold funerals for them.
Jones was a master at invoking spiritual concepts and presenting himself as
spiritually evolved. This is another common theme among sociopaths, and you
see it among Applewhite, Manson, Jones and even
present-day sociopaths who
are operating in America right now.
Historically, perhaps the best example of a delusional sociopath was none
other than Adolf Hitler.
He showed all the classic signs:
A brilliant
orator, a congenital liar, a complete lack of compassion for others, a
dominant, aggressive personality, and the invoking of spirituality to
justify his actions.
The Nazi
Swastika symbol, in fact, is a
derivation of the Flower of Life symbol derived from sacred geometry:
The modern sociopath - A threat to us all
Sociopaths aren't just a relic of history; I see their kind operating today,
in 2012.
A surprising number of people continue to fall
for the delusional (but convincing) web of lies spun by wordsmithing
sociopaths who may operate in almost any area of society: Science and
physics, New Age circles, fringe health, self improvement and even "pop"
spiritual development.
People from all walks of life allow themselves to be fooled by these
sociopaths, buying into their false narratives, toxic products and
destructive behavioral patterns, all driven into their heads through a
complex web of social engineering, linguistics and emotional influence.
Most
people are completely unaware they have been mesmerized into these cult
groups, just like the Jonestown people were completely unaware... or the
Heaven's Gate crowd.
There are people today, right now, who are zealous members of fringe cults
that advocate drinking toxic metals dissolved in sulfuric acid, eating
rotten meat festering with deadly bacteria, playing with poisonous snakes or
even dehydrating yourself in a sweat lodge to the point where you suffer
hallucinations that are then interpreted as "spiritual guidance."
These cults are operating right here in America, and they are led by
sociopaths who follow in the footsteps of monsters like Jim Jones and
Marshall Applewhite. Some of today's cult followers will pay for their
misplaced faith with their lives.
Others will eventually come to their senses and
wonder how they could have been so completely blinded by a false prophet.
Seven rules for
personal empowerment (without joining a cult)
The most shocking realization to take home from all this is that people who
live under the spell of a sociopath almost never realize it until after the
spell has been broken.
Just as the worshippers of Jim Jones believed
his organization to be based in love, life and light, people today who
worship sociopathic, charismatic leaders usually have no idea they have
already surrendered their will to someone who does not have their best
interests at heart.
This is why, I have always taught people the following
authentic principles of responsibility and power:
-
Think for yourself. Be skeptical of
everything. Most people, corporations, governments and institutions
are lying to you. There is much good in the world, but there is far
more selfishness and greed which is falsely presented as that which
is good.
-
Follow your inner truth, not some
external guru. Any guru who demands your obedience is a false
prophet. A real teacher is one who empowers you and sets you free to
explore your life experience with complete freedom tempered by a
code of morals and personal responsibility.
-
Serve in the protection of life, with or
without a church or spiritual group. You can protect life every day
in your own garden. Resist the seduction of profit and power that
comes from serving darkness (i.e. working for Big Pharma). Seek to
protect life, which is sacred and precious.
-
Value all living things, including
animals and plants. You are their shepherd. Protect the diversity of
life and the integrity of the continuation of life. (For example,
resist GMO and plant only non-hybrid seeds.)
-
Live an authentic life. Practice what
you teach. Walk your talk. Do not speak with one face and then
secretly act out another. Spiritual strength comes from spiritual
authenticity, and even if the world isn't aware of what you do when
no one is looking, God and the universe most certainly are. Karma
counts.
-
Defend the innocent. Stand your ground
against bullies. Resist tyranny. Promote freedom, liberty and
justice. Help others when you can, and seek to empower others with
the skills and knowledge they can use to support themselves rather
than creating dependency.
-
Tell the truth. It is powerful...
perhaps the most powerful thing in the universe. The truth
unfailingly outshines lies and deceptions. And even when the people
around you may not see the truth, the greater universe does. By
telling the truth, you empower yourself in all areas of your life,
and you bring yourself closer to true spiritual understanding.
