The shadow-banking component that adds to the
risk of non-regulatory oversight just deepens the mystery behind the most
powerful banking institution that runs roughshod over global finance.
In order to gain an insight into the complexity
of deception, examine
the function of the BIS. The granddaddy of all central
banks, the Bank for International Settlement, latest
BIS Annual Report
2011/2012, foretells future financial consolidation.
Banker to the World's Bank - Time to Deleverage
video interview on CNBC
From
Chapter V. Restoring fiscal sustainability, in this report concludes:
"Sovereigns have been losing their risk-free
status at an alarming rate. Fiscal positions were already unsustainable
in many advanced economies before the financial crisis, which in turn
led to significant further weakening.
The deterioration of public finances has
undermined financial stability, lowered the credibility of fiscal and
monetary policy, impaired the functioning of financial markets, and
increased private sector borrowing costs.
Restoring sustainable fiscal positions will
require implementing effective fiscal consolidation, promoting long-term
growth, and breaking the adverse feedback loop between bank and
sovereign risk."
The section called,
Box VI.A: Shadow banking,
states:
"While definitions differ, the term "shadow
banking" broadly refers to financial activities carried out by non-bank
financial institutions that create leverage and/or engage in maturity
and liquidity transformation.
Thus, even though they are subject to
different regulatory frameworks, shadow and traditional banks operate
alongside each other.
Shadow banking exists because historical and institutional factors, the
rapid pace of financial innovation and specialization have all increased
the attractiveness of performing certain types of financial
intermediation outside traditional banking. In normal times, shadow
banking enhances the resilience of the broader financial system by
offering unique financial products and a range of vehicles for managing
credit, liquidity and maturity risks.
But shadow banking also creates risks that
can undermine financial stability in the absence of prudential
safeguards."
The bombshell news that raises alarm is the
admission that "Too Big To Fail" is still the operative principle that
drives the banking system into an unsustainable servicing of debt
obligations.
The cloak of the shadow banking practice,
intended to circumvent usual regulatory standards, creeps along the soft
underbelly of respectable central banking. When a collapse catches up with
the racket of excessive leverage, the ensuing scandal is directed to some
esoteric phantom operation that is expendable.
The analysis in
Big Banks Take Risks Expecting
Taxpayers To Cover Losses identifies who ultimately bears the risk of the
world fiat, debt created, financial system.
"The report also emphasized the need to
increase the safety of the banking system by pushing banks to be
responsible for their losses, add to their financial buffers and avoid
risky practices. It added that big banks still have an interest in using
high-risk debt - so-called "leveraging" - to magnify any trading gains
because they can expect taxpayers to step in and cover their losses if
things go bad.
"Big banks continue to have an interest in driving up their leverage
without enough regard for the consequences of failure: because of their
systemic weight, they expect the public sector to cover the downside, "
said BIS.
"Another worrying sign is that trading, after a brief
crisis-induced squeeze, has again become a major source of income for
large banks."
Protecting the fractional reserve scheme, at all
cost, is the true purpose of the BIS. Sovereign holdings, with their ensuing
national debt owed to the banksters pays homage to the real owners of
underlying collateral assets.
From a source in the essay,
Revolution against Central Banks, explains a
scheme of global magnitude for financial control.
"The BIS is taking national currency
deposits from the 55 member/owner central banks and converting them to
SDR's on its own balance sheet.
The SDR's are 'claims on the freely usable
currencies of IMF members,' therefore, the deposits of the central banks
become claims on those currencies - the deposits of the fiat central
banks who can deposit as much as they feel at the BIS in whatever
currency the chose - including the SDR's allotted to their 'nation,' as
the central banks are the sole depositories for the national
wealth/sellers of the national debt.
The BIS is then paying out dividends to
these same member CB's in the form of SDR's, which again can be used to
claim currencies. By August 2009, they had just made up out of thin air
almost twelve times the supposed global supply of SDRs.
They are truly acting like the "central bank
of the world," complete with printing!"
By any objective standard of decency and
accountability, the BIS is the ultimate clearinghouse of worldwide debt for
the New World Order. Need proof, just reflect on the diversion used by a
captain from one of the most powerful "Godfather" family of investment
banking.
Finally in,
Time to Stop Expecting So Much From the Fed?, Goldman Sachs
strategist Jim ONeill told CNBC:
Even the central bank for central banks, the
Bank for International Settlements, is playing down the power of the Fed
and other central banks.
"It would be a mistake to think that central bankers can use their
balance sheets to solve every economic and financial problem," the BIS
said in its annual report.
"In fact, near-zero policy rates, combined with abundant and nearly
unconditional liquidity support, weaken incentives for the private
sector to repair balance sheets and for fiscal authorities to limit
their borrowing requirements," the report said.
World consumers are being pick-pocketed in the
graveyard of financial ruin.
Strip away the skin of a decayed corpse and
what remains is the stark skeleton of a dead paper monitory system. The life-support methods used to keep the
interest payments accruing, only forestall the day of reckoning.
The End Game for the central bankers is
foreclosure on pledged guarantees. Currency swaps will become a recall of
national fiat species and a replacement with a float of a new world coinage.
National governments are mere public diversions from the real power behind
the thrones.
