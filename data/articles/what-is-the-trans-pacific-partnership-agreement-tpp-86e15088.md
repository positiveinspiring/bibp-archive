The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a
secretive, multi-national trade agreement that threatens to extend
restrictive intellectual property (IP) laws across the globe and rewrite
international rules on its enforcement.
The main problems are two-fold:
-
IP
chapter: Leaked draft texts of the agreement show that the
IP chapter would have extensive negative ramifications for users
freedom of speech, right to privacy and due process, and hinder
peoples' abilities to innovate.
-
Lack of
transparency: The entire process has shut out
multi-stakeholder participation and is shrouded in secrecy.
The nine nations currently negotiating the TPP
are,
-
the US
-
Australia
-
Peru
-
Malaysia
-
Vietnam
-
New Zealand
-
Chile
-
Singapore
-
Brunei Darussalam
However, Canada and Mexico have also been
invited to join the negotiations and it is very likely they will join.
The TPP contains a chapter on intellectual
property covering copyright, trademarks, patents and perhaps,
geographical indications.
Since the draft text of the agreement has never
been officially released to the public, we know from leaked documents, such
as the
February 2011 draft US TPP IP Rights Chapter, that US negotiators are
pushing for the adoption of copyright measures far more restrictive than
currently required by international treaties, including the controversial
Anti-Counterfeiting Trade
Agreement (ACTA).
The TPP Will Rewrite
Global Rules on Intellectual Property Enforcement
All signatory countries will be required to
conform their domestic laws and policies to the provisions of the Agreement.
In the US, this is likely to further entrench
controversial aspects of US copyright law (such as the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
[DMCA]) and restrict the ability of Congress to engage in domestic law
reform to meet the evolving IP needs of American citizens and the innovative
technology sector.
The recently leaked US-proposed IP chapter also includes
provisions that appear to go beyond current US law.
The leaked US IP chapter includes many detailed
requirements that are more restrictive than current international standards,
and would require significant changes to other countries copyright laws.
These include obligations for countries to:
-
Regulate Temporary Copies
Treat temporary reproductions of
copyrighted works without copyright holders' authorization as
copyright infringement.
This was discussed but rejected at the
intergovernmental diplomatic conference that created two key 1996
international copyright treaties, the WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO
Performances and Phonograms Treaty.
-
Expand Copyright Terms
Create copyright terms well beyond the
internationally agreed period in the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).
Life + 70 years for works created by
individuals, and following the US-Oman Free Trade Agreement, either
95 years after publication or 120 years after creation for corporate
owned works (such as Mickey Mouse).
-
Escalate Protections for Digital Locks
It will also compel signatory nations to
enact laws banning circumvention of
digital locks (technological protection measures or TPMs) that
mirror the DMCA and treat violation of the TPM provisions as a
separate offense, even when no copyright infringement is involved.
This would require countries like New
Zealand to completely rewrite its innovative 2008 copyright law, as
well as override Australias carefully-crafted 2007 TPM regime
exclusions for region-coding on movies on DVDs, videogames, and
players, and for embedded software in devices that restrict access
to goods and services for the device - a thoughtful effort by
Australian policy makers to avoid the pitfalls experienced with the
US digital locks provisions.
In the US, business competitors have
used the DMCA to try to block printer cartridge refill services,
competing garage door openers, and to lock mobile phones to
particular network providers.
In short, countries would have to abandon any
efforts to learn from the mistakes of the US and its experience with the
DMCA over the last 12 years, and adopt many of the most controversial
aspects of US copyright law in their entirety.
At the same time, the US IP chapter does not
export the limitations and exceptions in the US copyright regime like fair
use, which have enabled freedom of expression and technological innovation
to flourish in the US. It includes only a placeholder for exceptions and
limitations.
This raises serious concerns about other
countries sovereignty and the ability of national governments to set laws
and policies to meet their domestic priorities.
Non-Transparent and On
The Fast Track
Despite the broad scope and far-reaching
implications of the TPP, negotiations for the agreement have taken place
behind closed doors and outside of the checks and balances that operate at
traditional multilateral treaty-making organizations such as the World
Intellectual Property Organization and the World Trade Organization.
Like ACTA, the TPP is being negotiated rapidly
with little transparency.
During the TPP negotiation round in Chile in
February 2011, negotiators received strong messages from
prominent civil society groups demanding an end to the secrecy that has
shielded TPP negotiations from the scrutiny of national lawmakers and the
public.
Letters addressed to government representatives
in
Australia, Chile,
Malaysia, New
Zealand and the US
emphasized that both the process and effect of the proposed TPP agreement is
deeply undemocratic.
TPP negotiators apparently discussed the
requests for greater public disclosure during the February 2011
negotiations, but took no action.
Why You Should
Care
TPP raises significant concerns about citizens
freedom of expression, due process, innovation, the future of the Internets
global infrastructure, and the right of sovereign nations to develop
policies and laws that best meet their domestic priorities.
In sum, the TPP puts at risk some of the most
fundamental rights that enable access to knowledge for the worlds citizens.
The USTR is pursuing a TPP agreement that will
require signatory counties to adopt heightened copyright protection that
advances the agenda of the US entertainment and pharmaceutical industries
agendas, but omits the flexibilities and exceptions that protect Internet
users and technology innovators.
The TPP will affect countries beyond the nine
that are currently involved in negotiations. Like ACTA, the TPP Agreement is
a plurilateral agreement that will be used to create new heightened global
IP enforcement norms.
Countries that are not parties to the
negotiation will likely be asked to accede to the TPP as a condition of
bilateral trade agreements with the US and other TPP members, or evaluated
against the TPP's copyright enforcement standards in the
annual Special 301 process administered by the USTR.

EFF has been fighting against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
intellectual property chapter for several years. This agreement poses a
great risk to users freedoms and access to information on a global scale.
We have created this infographic to capture the most problematic aspects of
TPP, and to help users, advocates and innovators from around the world
spread the word about how this agreement will impact them and their
societies.
