Who and What is on Trial?
When Splitting the Sky broke through police lines in his attempt to conduct
a citizens arrest of former US president George W. Bush, the Mohawk freedom
fighter pierced a thick wall of tyranny.
He broke through a tight phalanx of
state protection for the perpetrators of,
-
war crimes
-
crimes against
humanity
-
crimes against the peace
With his courageous act, Splitting the Sky announced the unwillingness of
millions of global citizens to tolerate any longer the culture of impunity
that places a small, interlinked global plutocracy above the law.
By
breaking police lines, the Attica brother and American Indian Movement
activist scouted a route of liberation for those of us seeking to get out
from under the weight of complicity in international crime committed in our
name. We are all deeply implicated in the state terror permeating the 9/11
wars because it is our tax dollars that fund these imperial assaults.
Splitting the Skys action in Calgary highlights the abject failure of law
enforcement agencies to do their job. It highlights the unwillingness of
police and those who direct them to apply the law equitably and
independently.
When he broke through police lines last March, Splitting the Sky built on
the message of Muntadar al-Zaidi, the Baghdad journalist who fired his shoes
at the departing US president. Al-Zaidis symbolic shot was seen and
applauded around the world. By dramatizing the role of so-called law
enforcers as protectors of international crime, Splitting the Sky
highlighted that many millions of global citizens have seen more than enough
evidence to understand that George W. Bush and his war cabinet are credibly
accused war criminals.
If we lived in a world where the integrity of law prevailed over the power
of money, political corruption and military might, the Cheney-Rumsfeld-Bush
syndicate of war profiteers would have been apprehended long ago to face
charges in a properly constituted court of international law.
-
When Splitting the Sky presents himself this coming March to a provincial
court in Calgary, Alberta to face a criminal charge for obstruction of
justice, who and what is really on trial?
-
Whose sense of justice was really
obstructed?
I predict that the light of future history will cast the trial of Splitting
the Sky as an important point of departure for a process of peoples
jurisprudence directed at bringing to justice those responsible for the
highest order of international crime.
The trial of Splitting the Sky calls attention to the partnership linking
Barack Obamas presidency to the Cheney-Bush-Rumsfeld brand of organized
crime headquartered in the military superpowers apparatus of so-called
national security.
It highlights the current US presidents expansion of his
predecessors policies of aggressive warfare aimed at appropriating natural
resources from indigenous peoples the world over. Conducted in the name of
an implausible official interpretation of what transpired on
September 11,
2001, the ongoing 9/11 wars widen and accelerate the imperial onslaught that
has gathered force ever since
Christopher Columbus initiated a new world
order in 1492.
The trial of Splitting the Sky places a spotlight on the ruthlessness of
state terror as manifest in torture, genocide, and aggressive warfare.
More
than six decades ago the judges sentencing the convicted Nazi war criminals
at Nuremberg deemed that aggressive warfare constitutes the supreme crime
against the entire human family, because it encompasses such a broad array
of tributary international crimes.
The police lines that Splitting the Sky briefly breached in Calgary, Alberta
were set up to protect the person whose blood-soaked hands signed the
executive orders for an orgy of state-sponsored criminality.
Thus the
Calgary police force, the RCMP, and those that direct them chose to make
themselves, as well as their agencies, accomplices in horrific crimes - crimes
that have transformed words like,
...into household phrases.
As the Nuremberg principles make clear, the implicated law enforcement
officers cannot claim in their defense that they were merely following
orders in deciding to arrest Splitting the Sky rather than George W. Bush.
-
Who gave the police their orders?
-
What was the chain of command?
-
What was
the content of the directives given the police?
The crown prosecutors have a
responsibility to make public this crucial information in presenting their
case against Splitting the Sky.
Why did George W. Bush and his handlers choose Calgary, Alberta as the site
of the former commander-in-chiefs first major speaking engagement after
leaving the US presidency? Calgary is a key colonial capital of the
Texas-based oil and gas empire that resides at the very core of the worlds
most powerful military-industrial complex.
Calgary is the political heartland of the minority government of Canadian
Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Harpers ascent to power was as the Canadian
franchise holder of the Bush brand of neocon governance, whose machinations
regularly subordinate the rule of law to jack-booted displays of law and
order.
This neocon approach has seen officers of the Canadian government hand over
civilians convicted of nothing to the Afghani puppet regime for certain
torture. As illustrated by the treatment of Omar Khadr, the lawlessness of
the current Canadian government makes Harper and Bush partners in
victimizing child soldiers, contrary to many international treaties.
A major sponsor of Bushs talk in Calgary was the
Bennett Jones law firm,
one of the key agencies engaged in the fire sale of western Canadas natural
resources.
The foreign colonization of Albertas resources often takes place
in complete defiance of Canadas constitutional affirmation of aboriginal
and treaty rights.
-
Will the Alberta judiciarys handling of Splitting the Skys trial continue
the slide of my home province away from the sovereignty of Canada?
-
Will the court extend Splitting the Sky a fair trial, or will the judge
railroad the accused at the behest of political masters in Washington,
Dallas, Houston, Ottawa and Calgary?
-
Will Splitting the Skys right to present a full defense be respected? Or
will the judge demean his or her court to decide, say, that George Bushs
real or imagined misdeeds have no place in the proceedings?
-
Will the provincial court of Alberta rise to the responsibilities invested
in this instrument of Canadian sovereignty? Or will the trial of Splitting
the Sky take place in a kangaroo court, putting on full display Calgarys
colonial function in the American empire?
-
Will the court encourage, embrace and even demand a full airing of the real
legal issues inherent in the decisions made by Splitting the Sky, and those
of the police officers who arrested him?
-
Will it illuminate or obfuscate the responsibility of citizens when we see
agents of the law unwilling to enforce statutes like Canadas Crimes Against
Humanity and War Crimes Act?
-
Is Canadas international reputation to be that of a haven for the most
recent crop of credibly accused war criminals?
The Calgary Principles
Whatever happens with the Crowns trial, Calgary will be the site of a
peoples process aimed at delivering some measure of justice in a world too
often starved of it.
Among those who have agreed to take part in both the Crowns and the
peoples processes are Ramsay Clark and Cynthia McKinney.
A former Attorney
General of the United States,
Ramsay Clark has a long history of
representing Splitting the Sky as his lawyer. This history began when
prominent figures in the United States intervened to cover up the lies and
crimes of the Attica prison debacle of 1971. This event changed Splitting
the Skys life forever.
In the US presidential election of 2008,
Cynthia McKinney ran as the Green
Partys candidate.
She is widely recognized as an inheritor of the quest for
domestic and international justice advanced in different ways by both Martin
Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Ms McKinney served for four terms as a US
Congresswoman representing a constituency in Georgia. She has stood bravely
for the principle that universal human rights extend to the Palestinian
people.
With her words and actions, Ms. McKinney epitomizes the necessary
merger of the global anti-war coalition and the international movement of
those committed to the quest for the truth of what really happened on
September 11, 2001.
In order to stop the otherwise never-ending 9/11 wars, we must make reason
and science prevail over fear-mongering, superstition and disinformation in
determining who was really responsible for the originating acts of the
global war on terror.
I propose that the convergence of events and personalities, character and
circumstance, on the frontiers of so much contested power offers an
important opening to a new era of juridical development. I propose that the
trial of Splitting the Sky presents a platform for the elaboration of a new
set of juridical rules and protocols to be known as The Calgary Principles.
It has been six decades since
the United Nations general assembly agreed to a succinct
refinement of the principles that emerged from the trial of some of the top
Nazis, as well as their juridical, medical, and industrialist accomplices.
During those decades, there has been an intensification of the culture of
impunity that immunizes those at the top of the hierarchy of wealth and
power from any legal accountability for their crimes.
Like the Tokyo trials of the defeated leadership of imperial Japan, the
Nuremberg Trials were a classic example of victors justice. The trend that
began in the aftermath of the Second World War has never been preempted.
Again and again, only those on the losing side of international conflicts
face legal consequences for their crimes.
Even the international tribunal dealing with the
Rwandan genocide of 1994
restricts its proceedings to dealing with the crimes of only one side in the
conflict. Only Hutus are targeted for prosecution. The jurists empowered by
the UN Security Council consistently veer away from any reckoning with the
many serious crimes of Paul Kagames Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic
Front.
With Anglo-American backing channeled from Uganda, this Tutsi-dominated
military force conquered its externally manipulated foes to become the core
unit of the Rwandan Armed Forces. Kagames army was built up to become a key
pillar of the Central African branch of the American Empire.
This empire
includes many Canadian mining companies, including Barrick Gold, that
operate with warlord and child soldier protection in one of the most
war-torn zones on the planet.
The immunity from prosecution of President Kagames Tutsi-dominated army
contributes significantly to the ongoing genocide that plagues the people of
the resource-rich eastern Congo to this day.
The inflicted deaths of
millions of displaced and brutalized Congolese clears the way for illicit
flows of,
-
blood diamonds
-
coltan
-
gold
-
and soon oil...
These operations, which expose the utter ruthlessness of imperial capitals
heart of darkness, epitomize the severity of the enforced lawlessness that
enriches a few at the lethal expense of the many.
The inequities of victors justice were on full display last March 17, when
the police decided to protect credibly accused war criminal George W. Bush
and to arrest and incarcerate Splitting the Sky. Like a disproportionately
large number of other Native Americans and African Americans, Splitting the
Sky has spent too much of his life locked up by the state.
On the other side of the ledger is George W. Bush. Bush epitomizes the class
that is, with some few exceptions, above the law.
In his lifes journeys,
Bush has drawn on the kinds of privilege that is rooted in generations of
colonization and conquest. The former US President accelerated these
trajectories of violence and theft when he and Dick Cheney were at the
controls of the most formidable war machine ever assembled.
In Calgary we saw close up the extraordinary protections regularly extended
to this credibly accused war criminal. In my view, Bush as well as his
patrons and clients will not be brought to trial until humanity finds a way
to withdraw the license to kill afforded by the institutionalized inequities
of victors justice.
A core precept of the Calgary Principles, therefore, must deal with the need
to move beyond the kind of victors justice that became institutionalized
following the Second World War. A central principle of the rule of law is
the need to enforce its authority equitably and uniformly. This basic
principle must be made to apply to those who commit the highest order of
international crime, no matter whether they are on the winning or losing
side of international or domestic conflicts.
As long as the power politics of victors justice continues to protect the
likes of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, the rule of law remains a fraud.
Under present conditions, the rule of law is a sad hoax designed to disguise
the role of law enforcement agencies as protectors of the ill-gotten wealth
often stripped from the branches of humanity that Frantz Fanon once labeled
the wretched of the earth.
The elaboration of the Calgary Principles will have to entail the quest for
new language and juridical concepts to capture the full extent and
complexity of international crime in the twenty-first century. In moving
this process forward, we could do worse than to look for inspiration to the
example set by the great Polish and Jewish jurist, Raphael Lemkin.
In 1944 Lemkin coined the term genocide in an attempt to identify the outer
extremes of the state terror then underway in Axis-occupied Europe.
Lemkins juridical contribution was not the last word in the process of
making international law reflect the expanding scope of international crime.
In more recent decades, the technology of mass destruction has become so
much more powerful and many-faceted than it was in Lemkins day that we need
new terms and procedures to deal with the moving frontiers of criminality.
-
Consider, for instance, the nature of the crime that takes place when whole
populations are sentenced to endless futures of disproportionately high
rates of genetic deformity through the saturation of their mother lands with
depleted uranium.
-
Consider the nature of a crime that would see a
drug
company covertly introduce a new disease strain in order to market a
prepared antidote of vaccine to cure the disease it had disseminated.
What names, what prohibitions, and what punishments do we need to respond to
and discourage crimes that infect populations, deform populations, and even
destroy whole ecosystems, making the renewal of all kinds of life, including
human life, impossible to sustain?
The makers of the Calgary Principles will have to pay particular attention
to the role of media conglomerates, public relations firms and public
broadcasters in creating the psychological environment that allows
international crime to thrive in the age of elite immunity from prosecution.
The sophisticated propaganda of the global war on terror presents a textbook
example of how mainstream media venues often play major roles in the
perceptual dehumanization of population groups whose natural resources are
targeted for appropriation in aggressive war.
We saw a small example of the role of mainstream media as thought police in
the censorship that characterized most of the coverage of George W. Bushs
visit to Calgary.
The journalists assigned to cover the event almost
uniformly directed attention away from Splitting the Skys attempt to
conduct a citizens arrest of George W. Bush.
Two interconnected trials
The trial of Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM) that will take place in New York
City in the months ahead will help to establish the geopolitical framework
for the formulation of the Calgary Principles and the trial of Splitting the
Sky.
For many months key venues of the mainstream media have been
advertising KSM as the so-called mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. After
having been tortured dozens of times in US custody, the demented KSM
apparently agrees with the label given him, even as he boasts outlandishly
of the role he has imagined for himself in many more alleged terrorist
incidents.
For millions of observers who do not accept the official conspiracy theory
of 9/11, KSM and those who will be tried with him are obvious patsies. KSMs
own history of double, triple and quadruple dealing illustrates that the
history of Al-Qaeda was internal, and remains internal, to that of the
national security state.
The operatives of the national security state once
did their complex business transactions with their pet Islamic theocrats
such as CIA asset
Osama bin Laden, through the Lahore-based Bank of Credit
and Commerce International.
The treatment of KSM is but one small part of the application of torture not
to unearth information about future terrorist attacks, but rather to create
a false record to support the specious claims on which the 9/11 wars are
premised. This propensity was put clearly on public display with news of the
torture in Egypt of Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi.
The purpose of Al-Libis torture,
which Dick Cheney directed, was to produce false testimony, subsequently
presented at the United Nations in 2003, of a non-existent connection
between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
The purpose of the Anglo-American resort to torture has recently been
described by Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, who
has become a whistle blower exposing the underlying fraud of the global war
on terror. Murray was removed from his job when he began to pay attention to
what was happening in his posting to prisoners flown in through illegal
renditions from many parts of the world.
Here is how Murray describes the patterns of torture in Uzbekistan, a key
polity in the regions multi-trillion dollar political boondoggle of oil and
gas extraction, as well as pipeline construction.
Murray asserts,
The whole point of the intelligence being obtained under torture was to
actually exaggerate the terrorist threats and to exaggerate the strength of
Al-Qaeda.
That was the whole point of why people were being tortured, to
confess that they were members of Al-Qaeda and to denounce long lists of
names of people as members of Al-Qaeda who werent members of Al-Qaeda.

By putting a focus on the lies and crimes of the
Cheney-Bush-Rumsfeld cabal
of war profiteers, the trial of Splitting the Sky, together with the
formulation of the Calgary Principles, is shaping up as a counterpoint to
the upcoming show trial of KSM and others in New York.
We invite broad participation in the Calgary proceedings this coming March
from jurists, academics, students and concerned citizens from around the
world.
The convergence of interest in and around Splitting the Skys trial
should be seen as one part of a global upsurge of popular will flowing from
the growing recognition that our formal machineries of domestic law and
international relations are leading humanity into a blind alley of death and
destruction. The ugly imperatives of might is right will prevail over the
rule of law until the people and peoples of the world find a way to overcome
the inequities of victors justice.
The core corporations of the military-industrial complex have achieved such
a lock grip on the executive, legislative and judicial branches of most of
the worlds governments that humanitys slender achievements in instituting
democracy are being quickly negated.
What meaning does an X on an election ballot have if voters have been
duped by disinformation and smear campaigns even as they have been drawn in
to realms of public mythology that are completely disconnected from the
realities of how power is exercised?
The citizens of Afghanistan are far from alone in suffering the fate of what
I call ballot box colonialism.
Hence it can be said that these days the most important agencies of the
military-industrial complex and the national security state are
the media
conglomerates. These agencies of propaganda for an aggressive war bombard us
on a daily basis with mental missiles of psychological warfare.
The constant barrage of messages we receive,
-
that peace is to be found in
war
-
that freedom is to be found in slavery
-
that wealth is to be found in
indebtedness
-
that truth is to be found in lies,
...is pulling humanity
away from our fragile inheritance of reason, rationality, and enlightened
discourse on the real menaces we face.
Earths endangered biosphere is the real source of humanitys health,
sustainability and security. That is where we must point much of our
remedial attention and creativity.
To do so, we must find a way to pull back
from the oblivion of the modern-day Indian Wars that are depriving so many
global citizens of life, liberty and happiness - peace, order and good
government - as we move into the second decade of the new millennium.
