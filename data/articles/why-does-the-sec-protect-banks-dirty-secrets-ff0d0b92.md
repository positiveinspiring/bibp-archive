Remember
Richard Bowen?
He is the former senior executive at Citigroup Inc. (C) who in November 2007
issued a clarion call to his colleagues and Citis board that a major
credit-quality problem loomed for the bank.

Bowen was the chief underwriter in the business
unit that bought some $50 billion annually in home mortgages from third
parties that were then bundled up and sold as securities to investors the
world over.
On Nov. 3 he sent an urgent e-mail to
executives including
Robert Rubin, the former U.S. Treasury
secretary who was then chairman of the banks executive committee, and
Gary Crittenden, the chief financial
officer, raising concerns about,
breakdowns in internal controls and
resulting significant but possibly unrecognized financial losses
existing within our organization.
Bowen wrote that he had been agonizing for some
time about the problem, especially since his direct superiors at the bank,
whom he had warned repeatedly since he first discovered the problem in
mid-2006, had done little or nothing to remedy it.
What he had discovered was that 60 percent of
the home mortgages that Citigroup had bought from third parties, or $30
billion, were defective, meaning that they didnt meet Citigroups
underwriting criteria.
Nevertheless, they were still packaged up -
defects and all - and sold as securities.
Almost Nothing
You know where this is going. The Citigroup executives
did next to nothing.
Rubin, who left the company in January 2009, told the federal Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission on April 8, 2010, that,
either I or somebody else sent it to the
appropriate people, and I do know factually that that was acted on
promptly and actions taken in response to it.
Commission Chairman Phil Angelides asked
Rubin to follow up with his commission and explain precisely what actions
Citigroup took in response to Bowens e-mail.
A few months later, Rubins attorneys
sent a letter stating that the,
e-mail was subsequently passed on to the
appropriate personnel at Citigroup and that Citigroup should be able
to provide a description of its response to Mr. Bowens concerns.
A Nixonian response if ever there was one.
Citigroups attorneys, in turn,
wrote to the commission in November 2010
that the bank had responded to Bowens e-mail by firing the head of the
group responsible for evaluating the credit quality of the purchased
mortgages - actually, Bowen had done that already - and by putting in place
a bunch of new processes.
Yet according to a July 2012
article in Bloomberg Markets magazine by
Bob Ivry about Sherry Hunt, who worked for Bowen,
There were no noticeable changes in the
mortgage machinery as a result of Bowens warning.
By the time of Rubins FCIC testimony, of
course, Citigroup had been bailed out with $45 billion in cash from the
American people, along with another $306 billion in guarantees from the
federal government for a pot of the very same toxic home mortgages that
Bowen had warned about.
Rubin pocketed $126 million in his 10 or so
years at the company. Bowen, who was stripped of his responsibilities at
Citigroup soon after writing the infamous e-mail, left the company two weeks
after Rubin.
He now teaches accounting at the University of
Texas at Dallas.
Warning Ignored
As horrific as it was for Rubin, Crittenden and
others to ignore Bowens explicit warning, thats not the end of the story.
As part of blowing the whistle on Citigroups
bad behavior, Bowen also alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the
banks main regulator, hoping it would thoroughly investigate the
breakdowns of internal controls and take legal action against those
responsible.
Before the bailout of Citigroup, he gave the SEC
two long depositions and 1,000 or so pages of documents, some of which were
taken from the Internet, detailing the extent of Citigroups problems and
Bowens attempts to rectify them. Importantly, he said he also gave his
permission for the SEC to release to the public his depositions and the
revealing documents.
Naturally, the SEC did nothing to pursue Bowens
claims before billions of taxpayer dollars were used to rescue Citigroup.
But it must abide by the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA), which allows the public to gain access to documents such as those Bowen
provided. It has a horrendous track record of fulfilling FOIA requests in
anything like a timely manner. My experience has been that the agency
begrudgingly gives out the bare minimum long after I really needed it.
Earlier this year, Bloombergs Ivry filed a FOIA
request with the SEC to get copies of Bowens two depositions and the 1,000
pages of documents.
Ivry wanted to know just what Bowen had
discovered about Citigroups bad behavior in the years leading up to its
bailout. Initially, the SEC stonewalled, claiming that the Bowen cache
amounted to Citigroup trade secrets.
When Ivry finally got his FOIA documents back
from the SEC, he was underwhelmed.
It was a discussion about nothing and it
was heavily redacted, including Bowens name, Ivry told me via e-mail.
Needless to say, he was unable to get any
additional insight into what Bowen had uncovered and was unable to inform
the rest of us.
Unreleased Documents
When I told Bowen, earlier this week, that the
SEC had failed to release his documents and his testimony about Citigroup to
Ivry, he was flabbergasted. For legal reasons, Bowen said, he cant share
the information directly, but he fully expected the SEC to make it available
to journalists and the public.
He also expected the SEC to investigate the
wrongdoing.
Im outraged, quite frankly, Bowen told
me.
I had been told that once the
investigations were concluded that my material would be available to the
public via FOIA. And to hear now that the SEC has made the decision that
no, it cannot be available, I know nothing about the legal side of this,
but quite frankly, Im totally outraged.
Last week, I filed my own FOIA request for
Bowens documents and testimony.
On Oct. 22, I received an acknowledgement letter
from the agency. My tracking number is 13-00937-FOIA. Trust me, Ill let you
know if the SEC gives me anything more than it gave Ivry.
But I wont be counting on it...
