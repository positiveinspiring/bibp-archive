The World Economic Forum (WEF)
held in Davos, Switzerland annually since 1971 self-describes on
their website as,
"independent
international organization committed to improving the state of the world
by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders of society
to shape global, regional and industry agendas."
In practice, world leaders
of business, banking, and politics gather behind closed doors and cement
plans to benefit their interests while publicly celebrating their
opportunistic solutions as global salvation.
In 2013 this body will meet once again in Switzerland from the 23rd
to 27th of January not only to discuss economics, but also to
address,
Public opinion on such matters is obviously not wanted or accepted.
The WEF is a non-profit organization which claims to have "no political,
partisan or national interests", but if youre discussing plans to change
global financial structures, encourage increased governance, and implement a
worldwide green economy, politics and special interests play a role in
this, and always have.
Indeed, it is
reported:
The annual meeting has also been decried as
a "mix of pomp and platitude", and criticized for moving away from
serious economics and accomplishing little of substance, particularly
with the increasing involvement of NGOs that have little or no expertise
in economics.
Instead of a discussion on the world economy
with knowledgeable experts alongside key business and political players,
the annual meeting now features the top media political causes of the
day, such as global climate change and AIDS in Africa
Like other shadowy meetings attended by the
extremely wealthy and powerful superclass such as
Bilderberg Group and
Trilateral Commission, Davos has come under fire in the past for
the manipulation by
the Global Elite, and protests are held annually outside
the event.
Strict security measures now keep protests far
away from the meetings, and protests are held in cities like Zurich or Bern
- far enough away so as not to disturb the civilized ambiance and the
elite lamenting,
"the rising power of the Internet and expanded possibilities
for public input."
The Guardians
Aditya Chakrabortty describes:
"More than 2,500 business executives and
bankers will converge on the highest town in Europe for the annual World
Economic Forum. For the next five days, Davos will, its safe to say,
boast more millionaires per square foot than anywhere else on the
planet.
A guest list leaked on to the web this
weekend included 680 company chief executives, and a plethora of
bankers: seven from Citigroup alone, six each from Goldman Sachs, JP
Morgan and Deutsche Bank.
David Cameron is on the list, along with 36
other sitting prime ministers. Naturally, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown
are both popping in.
[...]
And this is what makes Davos so fascinating: it is the most perfect case
study of how the practitioners of free-market, globalised capitalism
give the public one explanation for what they are doing and why, while
privately pursuing the complete opposite.
On the one hand there is an event attended
by Sharon Stone, Bono and a slew of tame academics (14 Nobel laureates
this week alone), the message being "were open to anyone".
On the other hand, there are those secret
meetings, off limits to anyone not in the Â£100k club. It is both a
reputation-laundry service, and the most shadowy backroom-dealing house.
"
Political critic
Noam Chomsky has condemned WEF,
and,
"characterized the term globalization as propaganda as used in
connection with trade policies advanced by the World Economic Forum":
The dominant propaganda systems have
appropriated the term globalization to refer to the specific version
of international economic integration that they favor, which privileges
the rights of investors and lenders, those of people being incidental.
In accord with this usage, those who favor a
different form of international integration, which privileges the rights
of human beings, become anti-globalist.
This is simply vulgar propaganda, like the
term anti-Soviet used by the most disgusting commissars to refer to
dissidents. It is not only vulgar, but idiotic.
Green
Davos Gone
Green
In 2013, the biggest push by the WEF is towards a green global economy,
with an estimate price tag of 14 trillion dollars:
Only a sustained and dramatic shift to
infrastructure and industrial practices using low-carbon technology can
save the world and its economy from devastating global warming,
according to a Davos-commissioned alliance led by the former Mexican
President, Felipe Calderon, in the most dramatic call so far to fight
climate change on business grounds.
This includes everything from power generation, transport, and buildings
to industry, forestry, water and agriculture, according to the Green
Growth Action Alliance, created at last years Davos meeting in Mexico.
The extra spending amounts to roughly $700bn a year until 2030 and would
provide a much-needed economic stimulus as well as reduce the costs
associated with global warming further down the line, said Mr Calderon,
who leads the alliance.
It is better to try to pre-empt events like Hurricane Sandy, which cost
$50bn, by keeping a lid on global warming, concluded the report,
researched by the Accenture consultancy.
It will have to be seen if pre-emptive
strategies involve the controversial (and until recent history,
unacknowledged) global geo-engineering and climate intervention
techniques such as atmospheric seeding, carbon dioxide removal, solar
radiation management, iron fertilization, etc.
Perhaps it will mean punitive carbon taxes and
fines, restrictions on business, travel, and personal freedoms, or global
population control.
Governance
The WEF suggests a crisis of leadership and debt are some of the biggest
challenges facing the world, and that global governance is the key to
stabilization.
Pascal Lamy, director-general of the
World Trade Organization (WTO), said:
We need proper global governance that has
the necessary tools, power and energy to create a more level playing
field at the international level.
At the end of the day, a push for increased
global governance and an environmental agenda is on the table for Davos
2013, under the banner of Resilent Dynamism:
"Mr. Klaus Schwab (WEF Founder and executive
chairman) said that the world is seeing "a new reality of sudden shocks
and prolonged global economic malaise, particularly in major economies
experiencing economic austerity".
He also mentioned, "Future growth in this
new context requires dynamism - bold vision and even bolder action."
You Can Save The World
Because the Davos governing class has insulated itself from public opinion,
the actual changes to,
-
government
-
environment
-
economies,
...may well hit a
wall during attempts to implement changes on the ground.
It will indeed require bold vision and bolder
action on the part of concerned citizens to ensure rights and freedoms are
not stripped away with the tools of fear, control, secrecy, power, and
money.
To phrase it another way:
"Either attribute - Resistance or
Discernment - alone is insufficient, as leadership in 2013 will
require both".
