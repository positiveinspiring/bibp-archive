The National Security Agency (NSA) is secretly
providing data to nearly two dozen U.S. government agencies with a
"Google-like" search engine built to share more than 850 billion records
about phone calls, emails, cellphone locations, and internet chats,
according to classified documents obtained by The Intercept.
The documents provide the first definitive
evidence that the NSA has for years made massive amounts of surveillance
data directly accessible to domestic law enforcement agencies. Planning
documents for ICREACH, as the search engine is called, cite the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration as key
participants.
ICREACH contains information on the private
communications of foreigners and, it appears, millions of records on
American citizens who have not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Details about
its existence are contained in the archive of materials provided to
The
Intercept by NSA whistleblower
Edward Snowden.
Earlier revelations sourced to the Snowden
documents have exposed a multitude of NSA programs for collecting large
volumes of communications.
The NSA has acknowledged that it shares some of
its collected data with domestic agencies like the FBI, but details about
the method and scope of its sharing have remained shrouded in secrecy.
ICREACH has been accessible to more than 1,000
analysts at 23 U.S. government agencies that perform intelligence work,
according to
a 2010 memo.
A planning
document from 2007 lists the DEA, FBI, Central Intelligence Agency, and
the Defense Intelligence Agency as core members. Information shared through
ICREACH can be used to track people's movements, map out their networks of
associates, help predict future actions, and potentially reveal religious
affiliations or political beliefs.
The creation of ICREACH represented a landmark
moment in the history of classified U.S. government surveillance, according
to the NSA documents.
"The ICREACH team delivered the first-ever
wholesale sharing of communications metadata within the U.S. Intelligence
Community," noted
a top-secret memo dated December 2007.
"This team began over two years
ago with a basic concept compelled by the IC's increasing need for
communications metadata and NSA's ability to collect, process and store vast
amounts of communications metadata related to worldwide intelligence
targets."
The search tool was designed to be the largest
system for internally sharing secret surveillance records in the United
States, capable of handling two to five billion new records every day,
including more than 30 different kinds of metadata on emails, phone calls,
faxes, internet chats, and text messages, as well as location information
collected from cellphones.
Metadata reveals information about a
communication - such as the "to" and "from" parts of an email, and the time
and date it was sent, or the phone numbers someone called and when they
called - but not the content of the message or audio of the call.
ICREACH does not appear to have a direct
relationship to the large NSA database, previously
reported by The Guardian, that stores information on millions
of ordinary Americans' phone calls under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
Unlike the 215 database, which is accessible to a small number of NSA
employees and can be searched only in terrorism-related investigations,
ICREACH grants access to a vast pool of data that can be mined by analysts
from across the intelligence community for "foreign intelligence" - a vague
term that is far broader than counterterrorism.
Data available through ICREACH appears to be
primarily derived from surveillance of foreigners' communications, and
planning documents show that it draws on a variety of different sources of
data maintained by the NSA.
Though
one 2010 internal paper clearly calls it "the ICREACH database," a U.S.
official familiar with the system disputed that, telling The Intercept
that while,
"it enables the sharing of certain foreign intelligence
metadata," ICREACH is "not a repository [and] does not store events or
records."
Instead, it appears to provide analysts with the ability to
perform a one-stop search of information from a wide variety of separate
databases.
In a statement to The Intercept, the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence confirmed that the system
shares data that is swept up by programs authorized under Executive Order
12333, a
controversial Reagan-era presidential directive that underpins several NSA bulk surveillance operations that monitor communications overseas.
The
12333 surveillance takes place with no court oversight and has received
minimal Congressional scrutiny because it is targeted at foreign, not
domestic, communication networks.
But the broad scale of 12333 surveillance
means that some Americans' communications get caught in the dragnet as they
transit international cables or satellites - and documents contained in the
Snowden archive indicate that ICREACH taps into some of that data.
Legal experts told The Intercept they
were shocked to learn about the scale of the ICREACH system and are
concerned that law enforcement authorities might use it for domestic
investigations that are not related to terrorism.
"To me, this is extremely troublesome," said
Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security
Program at the New York University School of Law's
Brennan Center for Justice.
"The myth that metadata is just a bunch of
numbers and is not as revealing as actual communications content was
exploded long ago - this is a trove of incredibly sensitive
information."
Brian Owsley, a federal magistrate judge between
2005 and 2013, said he was alarmed that traditional law enforcement agencies
such as the FBI and the DEA were among those with access to the NSA's
surveillance troves.
"This is not something that I think the
government should be doing," said Owsley, an assistant professor of law
at Indiana Tech Law School.
"Perhaps if information is useful in a
specific case, they can get judicial authority to provide it to another
agency. But there shouldn't be this buddy-buddy system back-and-forth."
Jeffrey Anchukaitis, an
ODNI spokesman, declined to comment on a
series of questions from The Intercept about the size and scope of
ICREACH, but said that sharing information had become,
"a pillar of the post-9/11 intelligence
community" as part of an effort to prevent valuable intelligence from
being "stove-piped in any single office or agency."
Using ICREACH to query the surveillance data,
"analysts can develop vital intelligence
leads without requiring access to raw intelligence collected by other IC
[Intelligence Community] agencies," Anchukaitis said.
"In the case of NSA, access to raw signals
intelligence is strictly limited to those with the training and
authority to handle it appropriately. The highest priority of the
intelligence community is to work within the constraints of law to
collect, analyze and understand information related to potential threats
to our national security."
One-Stop Shopping
The mastermind behind ICREACH was recently
retired NSA director Gen. Keith Alexander, who outlined his vision for the
system in
a classified 2006 letter to the then-Director of National Intelligence
John Negroponte.
The search tool, Alexander wrote, would,
"allow
unprecedented volumes of communications metadata to be shared and analyzed,"
opening up a "vast, rich source of information" for other agencies to
exploit.
By late 2007 the NSA reported to its employees
that the system had gone live as a pilot program.
The NSA described ICREACH as a "one-stop
shopping tool" for analyzing communications. The system would enable at
least a 12-fold increase in the volume of metadata being shared between
intelligence community agencies, the documents
stated.
Using ICREACH, the NSA planned to boost the
amount of communications "events" it shared with other U.S. government
agencies from 50 billion to more than 850 billion, bolstering an older
top-secret data sharing system named CRISSCROSS/PROTON, which was launched
in the 1990s and managed by the CIA.
To allow government agents to sift through the
masses of records on ICREACH, engineers designed a simple "Google-like"
search interface.
This enabled analysts to run searches against
particular "selectors" associated with a person of interest - such as an
email address or phone number - and receive a page of results displaying,
for instance, a list of phone calls made and received by a suspect over a
month-long period.
The documents suggest these results can be used
reveal the "social network" of the person of interest - in other words,
those that they communicate with, such as friends, family, and other
associates.
The purpose of ICREACH, projected initially to
cost between $2.5 million and $4.5 million per year, was to allow government
agents to comb through the NSA's metadata troves to identify new leads for
investigations, to predict potential future threats against the U.S., and to
keep tabs on what the NSA calls,
"worldwide intelligence targets."
However, the documents make clear that it is not
only data about foreigners' communications that are available on the system.
Alexander's memo states that "many millions
of
minimized communications metadata records" would be available through
ICREACH, a reference to the process of "minimization," whereby identifying
information - such as part of a phone number or email address - is removed
so it is not visible to the analyst.
NSA documents define minimization as,
"specific
procedures to minimize the acquisition and retention [of] information
concerning unconsenting U.S. persons",
...making it a near certainty that ICREACH gives analysts access to millions of records about Americans.
The "minimized" information can still be
retained under NSA rules for up to five years and "unmasked" at any point
during that period if it is ever deemed necessary for an investigation.
The Brennan Center's Goitein said it appeared
that with ICREACH, the government "drove a truck" through loopholes that
allowed it to circumvent restrictions on retaining data about Americans.
This raises a variety of legal and
constitutional issues, according to Goitein, particularly if the data can be
easily searched on a large scale by agencies like the FBI and DEA for their
domestic investigations.
"The idea with minimization is that the
government is basically supposed to pretend this information doesn't
exist, unless it falls under certain narrow categories," Goitein said.
"But functionally speaking, what we're
seeing here is that minimization means, 'we'll hold on to the data as
long as we want to, and if we see anything that interests us then we can
use it.'"
A key question, according to several experts
consulted by The Intercept, is whether the FBI, DEA or other
domestic agencies have used their access to ICREACH to secretly trigger
investigations of Americans through a controversial process known as
"parallel construction."
Parallel construction involves law enforcement
agents using information gleaned from covert surveillance, but later
covering up their use of that data by creating a new evidence trail that
excludes it.
This hides the true origin of the investigation
from defense lawyers and, on occasion, prosecutors and judges - which means
the legality of the evidence that triggered the investigation cannot be
challenged in court.
In practice, this could mean that a DEA agent
identifies an individual he believes is involved in drug trafficking in the
United States on the basis of information stored on ICREACH. The agent
begins an investigation but pretends, in his records of the investigation,
that the original tip did not come from the secret trove.
Last year, Reuters
first reported details of parallel construction based on NSA data,
linking the practice to a unit known as the Special Operations Division,
which Reuters said distributes tips from NSA intercepts and a DEA database
known as DICE.
Tampa attorney James Felman, chair of the
American Bar Association's criminal justice section, told The Intercept
that parallel construction is a "tremendously problematic" tactic because
law enforcement agencies,
"must be honest with courts about where they
are getting their information."
The ICREACH revelations, he said,
"raise the question of whether parallel
construction is present in more cases than we had thought. And if that's
true, it is deeply disturbing and disappointing."
Anchukaitis, the ODNI spokesman, declined to say
whether ICREACH has been used to aid domestic investigations, and he would
not name all of the agencies with access to the data.
"Access to information-sharing tools is
restricted to users conducting foreign intelligence analysis who have
the appropriate training to handle the data," he said.

Project CRISSCROSS
The roots of ICREACH can be traced back more
than two decades.
In the early 1990s, the CIA and the DEA embarked
on a secret initiative called Project CRISSCROSS. The agencies built a
database system to analyze phone billing records and phone directories, in
order to identify links between intelligence targets and other persons of
interest.
At first, CRISSCROSS was used in Latin America
and was "extremely successful" at identifying narcotics-related suspects. It
stored only five kinds of metadata on phone calls: date, time, duration,
called number, and calling number, according to
an NSA memo.
The program rapidly grew in size and scope. By
1999, the NSA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the FBI had gained
access to CRISSCROSS and were contributing information to it.
As CRISSCROSS continued to expand, it was
supplemented with a system called PROTON that enabled analysts to store and
examine additional types of data. These included unique codes used to
identify individual cellphones, location data, text messages, passport and
flight records, visa application information, as well as excerpts culled
from CIA intelligence reports.
An NSA memo
noted that PROTON could identify people based on whether they behaved in
a "similar manner to a specific target."
The memo also said the system,
"identifies correspondents in common with
two or more targets, identifies potential new phone numbers when a
target switches phones, and identifies networks of organizations based
on communications within the group."
In July 2006, the NSA estimated that it was
storing 149 billion phone records on PROTON.
According to the NSA documents, PROTON was used
to track down "High Value Individuals" in the United States and Iraq,
investigate front companies, and discover information about foreign
government operatives.
CRISSCROSS enabled major narcotics arrests and
was integral to the CIA's rendition program during the Bush Administration,
which involved abducting terror suspects and flying them to secret "black
site" prisons where they were brutally interrogated and sometimes tortured.
One NSA document on the system, dated from July 2005, noted that the use
of communications metadata,
"has been a contribution to virtually every
successful rendition of suspects and often, the deciding factor."
However, the NSA came to view CRISSCROSS/PROTON
as insufficient, in part due to the aging standard of its technology.
The intelligence community was sensitive to
criticism that it had failed to share information that could potentially
have helped prevent the 9/11 attacks, and it had been strongly criticized
for intelligence failures before the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
For the NSA, it was time to build a new and more
advanced system to radically increase metadata sharing.
A New Standard
In 2006, NSA director Alexander drafted his
secret proposal to then-Director of National Intelligence Negroponte.
Alexander laid out his vision for what he
described as a "communications metadata coalition" that would be led by the
NSA.
His idea was to build a sophisticated new tool
that would grant other federal agencies access to "more than 50 existing NSA/CSS
metadata fields contained in trillions of records" and handle "many
millions" of new minimized records every day - indicating that a large
number of Americans' communications would be included.
The NSA's contributions to the ICREACH system,
Alexander wrote,
"would dwarf the volume of NSA's present
contributions to PROTON, as well as the input of all other [intelligence
community] contributors."
Alexander explained in the memo that NSA was
already collecting "vast amounts of communications metadata" and was
preparing to share some of it on a system called GLOBALREACH with its
counterparts in the so-called
Five Eyes surveillance alliance:
-
the United Kingdom
-
Australia
-
Canada
-
New Zealand
ICREACH, he proposed, could be designed like
GLOBALREACH and accessible only to U.S. agencies in the intelligence
community, or IC.
A top-secret
PowerPoint presentation from May 2007 illustrated how ICREACH would work
- revealing its "Google-like" search interface and showing how the NSA
planned to link it to the DEA, DIA, CIA, and the FBI.
Each agency would access and input data through
a secret data "broker" - a sort of digital letterbox - linked to the central
NSA system. ICREACH, according to the presentation, would also receive
metadata from the Five Eyes allies.
The aim was not necessarily for ICREACH to
completely replace CRISSCROSS/PROTON, but rather to complement it.
The NSA planned to use the new system to perform
more advanced kinds of surveillance - such as "pattern of life analysis,"
which involves monitoring who individuals communicate with and the places
they visit over a period of several months, in order to observe their habits
and predict future behavior.
The NSA agreed to train other U.S. government
agencies to use ICREACH. Intelligence analysts could be "certified" for
access to the massive database if they required access in support of a given
mission, worked as an analyst within the U.S. intelligence community, and
had top-secret security clearance.
(According to
the latest
government figures, there are more than 1.2 million government employees
and contractors with top-secret clearance.)
In November 2006, according to the documents,
the Director of National Intelligence approved the proposal. ICREACH was
rolled out as a test program by late 2007.
It's not clear when it became fully operational,
but
a September 2010 NSA memo referred to it as the primary tool for sharing
data in the intelligence community.
"ICREACH has been identified by the Office
of the Director of National Intelligence as the U.S. Intelligence
Community's standard architecture for sharing communications metadata,"
the memo states, adding that it provides "telephony metadata events"
from the NSA and its Five Eyes partners "to over 1000 analysts across 23
U.S. Intelligence Community agencies."
It does not name all of the 23 agencies,
however.
The limitations placed on analysts authorized to
sift through the vast data troves are not outlined in the Snowden files,
with only scant references to oversight mechanisms. According to the
documents, searches performed by analysts are subject to auditing by the
agencies for which they work.
The documents also say the NSA would conduct
random audits of the system to check for any government agents abusing their
access to the data. The Intercept asked the NSA and the ODNI
whether any analysts had been found to have conducted improper searches, but
the agencies declined to comment.
While the NSA initially estimated making upwards
of 850 billion records available on ICREACH, the documents indicate that
target could have been surpassed, and that the number of personnel accessing
the system may have increased since the 2010 reference to more than 1,000
analysts.
The intelligence community's top-secret "Black
Budget" for 2013, also obtained by Snowden,
shows that the NSA recently sought new funding to upgrade ICREACH to,
"provide IC analysts with access to a wider
set of shareable data."
In December last year, a surveillance review
group appointed by President Obama
recommended that as a general rule,
"the government should not be permitted to
collect and store all mass, undigested, non-public personal information
about individuals to enable future queries and data-mining for foreign
intelligence purposes."
It also recommended that any information about
United States persons should be,
"purged upon detection unless it either has
foreign intelligence value or is necessary to prevent serious harm to
others."
Peter Swire, one of the five members of the
review panel, told The Intercept he could not comment on whether
the group was briefed on specific programs such as ICREACH, but noted that
the review group raised concerns that,
"the need to share had gone too far among
multiple agencies."
