From May 14-17, the global elite met in secret
in Greece for the yearly Bilderberg conference, amid scattered and
limited global media attention. Roughly 130 of the worlds most powerful
individuals came together to discuss the pressing issues of today, and to
chart a course for the next year.
The main topic of discussion at this years
meeting was the global financial crisis, which is no surprise, considering
the list of conference attendees includes many of the primary architects of
the crisis, as well as those poised to solve it.
The Agenda - The
Restructuring of the Global Political Economy
Before the meeting began, Bilderberg investigative journalist Daniel
Estulin reported on the main item of the agenda, which was leaked to him
by his sources inside. Though such reports cannot be verified, his sources,
along with those of veteran Bilderberg tracker, Jim Tucker, have
proven to be shockingly accurate in the past.
Apparently, the main topic of discussion at this
year's meeting was to address
the
economic crisis, in terms of undertaking,
Either a prolonged, agonizing depression
that dooms the world to decades of stagnation, decline and poverty... or
an intense-but-shorter depression that paves the way for a new
sustainable economic world order, with less sovereignty but more
efficiency.
Other items on the agenda included a plan to,
continue to deceive millions of savers and
investors who believe the hype about the supposed up-turn in the
economy. They are about to be set up for massive losses and searing
financial pain in the months ahead, and There will be a final push for
the enactment of Lisbon Treaty, pending on Irish voting YES on the
treaty in Sept or October, [1] which would give the European
Union massive powers over its member nations, essentially making it a
supranational regional government, with each country relegated to more
of a provincial status.
Shortly after the meetings began, Bilderberg
tracker Jim Tucker reported that his inside sources revealed that the
group has on its agenda,
the plan for a global department of health,
a global treasury and a shortened depression rather than a longer
economic downturn.
Tucker reported that Swedish Foreign Minister
and former Prime Minister, Carl Bildt,
Made a speech advocating turning the World
Health Organization into a world department of health, advocating
turning the IMF into a world department of treasury, both of course
under the auspices of
the United Nations.
Further, Tucker reported that,
Treasury Secretary Geithner and Carl Bildt
touted a shorter recession not a 10-year recession... partly because a
10 year recession would damage Bilderberg industrialists themselves, as
much as they want to have a global department of labor and a global
department of treasury, they still like making money and such a long
recession would cost them big bucks industrially because nobody is
buying their toys... the tilt is towards keeping it short. [2]
After the meetings finished, Daniel Estulin
reported that,
One of Bilderbergs primary concerns
according to Estulin is the danger that their zeal to reshape the world
by engineering chaos in order to implement their long term agenda
could cause the situation to spiral out of control and eventually lead
to a scenario where Bilderberg and
the global elite in general are
overwhelmed by events and end up losing their control over the planet.
[3]
On May 21, the Macedonian International News
Agency reported that,
A new Kremlin report on the shadowy
Bilderberg Group, who this past week held their annual meeting in
Greece, states that the Wests financial, political and corporate elite
emerged from their conclave after coming to an agreement that in order
to continue their drive towards a
New World Order dominated by the Western Powers, the US
Dollar has to be totally destroyed.
Further, this same unconfirmed Kremlin report,
stated that,
most of the Wests wealthiest elite
convened at an unprecedented secret meeting in New York called for and
led by
David Rockefeller, to plot the demise
of the US Dollar. [4]
This report, which was not acknowledged by other
media sources, requires verification.
The Secret Meeting of Billionaires
The meeting being referred to was a secret meeting where,
A dozen of the richest people in the world
met for an unprecedented private gathering at the invitation of Bill
Gates and Warren Buffett to talk about giving away money,
...held at Rockefeller University, and included
notable philanthropists such as:
One attendee stated that,
It wasnt secret, but that, It was meant
to be a gathering among friends and colleagues. It was something folks
have been discussing for a long time. Bill and Warren hoped to do this
occasionally. They sent out an invite and people came.
Chronicle of Philanthropy editor Stacy
Palmer said,
Given how serious these economic times are,
I don't think it's surprising these philanthropists came together, and
that, They don't typically get together and ask each other for advice.
The three hosts of the meeting were Buffet,
Gates and David Rockefeller.[5] [See: Appendix 2
far below].
Bilderberg founding member
David Rockefeller,
Honorary Chairman of the
Council on Foreign Relations,
Honorary Chairman and Founder of the
Trilateral Commission,
Chairman of the Council of the Americas and the Americas Society,
former Chairman and CEO of Chase Manhattan Bank (now JP Morgan Chase Bank).
At the meeting,
participants steadfastly refused to reveal
the content of the discussion. Some cited an agreement to keep the
meeting confidential. Spokesmen for Mr. Buffett, Mr. Bloomberg, Mr.
Gates, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Soros and Ms. Winfrey and others dutifully
declined comment, though some confirmed attendance. [6]
Reports indicate that,
They discussed how to address the global
slump and expand their charitable activities in the downturn. [7]
The UK newspaper The Times reported that
these,
leading billionaires have met secretly to
consider how their wealth could be used to slow the growth of the
worlds population, and that they discussed joining forces to overcome
political and religious obstacles to change.
Interestingly,
The informal afternoon session was so
discreet that some of the billionaires aides were told they were at
security briefings.
Further,
The billionaires were each given 15 minutes
to present their favorite cause. Over dinner they discussed how they
might settle on an umbrella cause that could harness their interests,
and what was decided upon was that, they agreed that
overpopulation was a priority.
Ultimately,
a consensus emerged that they would back a
strategy in which population growth would be tackled as a potentially
disastrous environmental, social and industrial threat, and that, They
need to be independent of government agencies, which are unable to head
off the disaster we all see looming.
One guest at the meeting said that,
They wanted to speak rich to rich without
worrying anything they said would end up in the newspapers, painting
them as an alternative world government. [8]
The Leaked Report
Bilderberg investigative reporter Daniel Estulin reportedly received
from his inside sources a 73-page Bilderberg Group meeting wrap-up
for participants, which revealed that there were some serious disagreements
among the participants.
The hardliners are for dramatic decline and
a severe, short-term depression, but there are those who think that
things have gone too far and that the fallout from the global economic
cataclysm cannot be accurately calculated if Henry Kissinger's model is
chosen. Among them is Richard Holbrooke. What is unknown at this point:
if Holbrooke's point of view is, in fact, Obama's.
The consensus view was that the recession would
get worse, and that recovery would be relatively slow and protracted, and
to look for these terms in the press over the next weeks and months.
Estulin reported,
that some leading European bankers faced
with the specter of their own financial mortality are extremely
concerned, calling this high wire act "unsustainable," and saying that
US budget and trade deficits could result in the demise of the dollar.
One Bilderberger said that,
the banks themselves don't know the answer
to when (the bottom will be hit).
Everyone appeared to agree,
that the level of capital needed for the
American banks may be considerably higher than the US government
suggested through their recent stress tests. Further, someone from the
IMF pointed out that its own study on historical recessions suggests
that the US is only a third of the way through this current one;
therefore economies expecting to recover with resurgence in demand from
the US will have a long wait.
One attendee stated that,
Equity losses in 2008 were worse than those
of 1929, and that, The next phase of the economic decline will also be
worse than the '30s, mostly because the US economy carries about $20
trillion of excess debt. Until that debt is eliminated, the idea of a
healthy boom is a mirage. [9]
According to Jim Tucker, Bilderberg is working
on setting up a summit in Israel from June 8-11, where the worlds
leading regulatory experts can address the current economic situation in
one forum.
In regards to the proposals put forward by
Carl Bildt to create a world treasury department and world department of
health under the United Nations,
the IMF is said to become the World
Treasury, while the World Health Organization is to become the
world department of health. Bildt also reaffirmed using climate change as
a key challenge to pursue Bilderberg goals, referring to the economic crisis
as a once-in-a-generation crisis while global warming is a
once-in-a-millennium challenge.
Bildt also advocated expanding NAFTA through the
Western hemisphere to create an
American Union, using the EU as a model of
integration.
The IMF reportedly sent a report to Bilderberg advocating its rise to
becoming the World Treasury Department, and,
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
enthusiastically endorsed the plan for a World Treasury Department,
although he received no assurance that he would become its leader.
Geithner further said,
Our hope is that we can work with Europe on
a global framework, a global infrastructure which has appropriate global
oversight. [10]
Bilderbergs Plan in
Action?
Reorganizing the Federal Reserve
Following the Bilderberg meeting, there were several interesting
announcements made by key participants, specifically in regards to
reorganizing
the Federal Reserve.
On May 21, it was reported that US Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner,
is believed to be leaning heavily towards
giving the Federal Reserve a central role in future regulation, and it
is understood that the Fed would take on some of the work currently
undertaken by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
[11]
On Wednesday, May 20, Geithner spoke before the
Senate Banking Committee, at which he stated that,
there are important indications that our
financial system is starting to heal.
In regards to regulating the financial system,
Geithner stated that,
we must ensure that international rules for
financial regulation are consistent with the high standards we will be
implementing in the United States. [12]
US Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner,
former President of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York
Bloomberg reported that,
The Obama administration may call for
stripping the Securities and Exchange Commission of some of its powers
under a regulatory reorganization, and that, The proposal, still being
drafted, is likely to give the Federal Reserve more authority to
supervise financial firms deemed too big to fail. The Fed may inherit
some SEC functions, with others going to other agencies.
Interestingly,
SEC Chairman
Mary Schapiros agency has been mostly
absent from negotiations within the administration on the regulatory
overhaul, and she has expressed frustration about not being consulted.
It was reported that,
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was set
to discuss proposals to change financial regulations last night at a
dinner with National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers [who was
also present at Bilderberg], former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker [also at
Bilderberg], ex-SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and Elizabeth Warren, the
Harvard University law professor who heads the congressional watchdog
group for the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. [13]
The Federal Reserve is a privately owned
central bank, owned by its shareholders, consisting of the major banks
the make up each regional Fed bank (the largest of which is JP Morgan Chase
and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York).
This plan would essentially give a privately
owned bank, which has governmental authority, the ability to regulate the
banks that own it. Its the equivalent of getting a Colonel to guard a
General to whom he is directly answerable. Talk about the fox guarding
the hen house. It is literally granting ownership over the financial
regulator to the banks being regulated.
As Market Watch, an online publication of the Wall Street Journal,
reported,
The Federal Reserve, created nearly 100
years ago in the aftermath of a financial panic, could be transformed
into a different agency as the Obama administration reinvents the way
government interacts with the financial system.
Referring to Geithners Senate appearance, it
was reported that,
Geithner was also grilled on the cozy
relationships that exist between the big banks and the regional Federal
Reserve banks. Before Geithner joined the administration, he was
president of the New York Fed, which is a strange public-private hybrid
institution that is actually owned and run by the banks.
In response,
Geithner insisted that the private banks
have no say over the policies of the New York Fed, but he acknowledged
that the banks do have a say in hiring the president, who does make
policy. The chairman of the New York Fed, Stephen Friedman, was forced
to resign earlier this month because of perceived conflicts of interest
due to his large holdings in Goldman Sachs. [14]
The IMF as a Global Treasury
The Bilderberg agenda of creating a
global treasury has already been started prior to the Bilderberg meeting,
with decisions made during the G20 financial summit in April. Although the
G20 seemed to frame it more in context of being formed into a global central
bank, although it is likely the IMF could fill both roles.
Following the G20 meeting at the beginning of April, 2009, it was reported
that,
The world is a step closer to a global
currency, backed by a global central bank, running monetary policy for
all humanity, as the Communiqué released by the G20 leaders stated
that, We have agreed to support a general SDR allocation which will
inject $250bn (£170bn) into the world economy and increase global
liquidity, and that, SDRs are Special Drawing Rights, a
synthetic paper currency issued by the International Monetary Fund that
has lain dormant for half a century.
Essentially,
they are putting a de facto world currency
into play. It is outside the control of any sovereign body. [15]
[See Appendix 2 far below]
Following the Bilderberg meeting,
President Obama has asked Congress to
authorize $100 billion in loans to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to help create a $500 billion global bailout fund, which would give the
IMF the essential prerogative of a global treasury, providing bailouts
for countries in need around the world.
Further,
the bill would allow the IMF to borrow up
to $100 billion from the U.S. and increase the U.S. fiscal contribution
to the IMF by $8 billion.
Elaborating on the program, it was reported
that,
World leaders began on the global bailout
initiative, called the New Arrangement for Borrowing (NAB), at
the G-20 summit in early April. The president agreed at that time to
make the additional funds available.
Obama wrote that,
Treasury Secretary Geithner concluded that
the size of the NAB is woefully inadequate to deal with the type of
severe economic and financial crisis we are experiencing, and I agree
with him. [16]
With the G20 decision to increase the usage of
IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), forming a de facto world
currency, it was recently reported that,
Sub-Saharan Africa will receive around $10
billion from the IMF in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to help its
economies weather the global financial crisis, and that, As part of a
$1.1 trillion deal to combat the world economic downturn agreed at
April's G20 summit, the IMF will issue $250 billion worth of SDRs, which
can be used to boost foreign currency reserves. [17]
Recent reports have also indicated that the
IMFs role in issuing SDRs goes hand in hand with the Bilderberg discussion
on the potential collapse of the US dollar, and,
Transforming the dollar standard into an
SDR-based system would be a major break with a policy that has lasted
more than 60 years.
It was reported that,
There are two ways in which the dollars
role in the international monetary system can be reduced. One
possibility is a gradual, market-determined erosion of the dollar as a
reserve currency in favor of the Euro. But, while the Euros'
international role especially its use in financial markets has
increased since its inception, it is hard to envisage it overtaking the
dollar as the dominant reserve currency in the foreseeable future.
However,
With the dollars hegemony unlikely to be
seriously undermined by market forces, at least in the short and
medium-term, the only way to bring about a major reduction in its role
as a reserve currency is by international agreement.
This is where the SDRs come into play, as,
One way to make the SDR the major reserve
currency relatively soon would be to create and allocate a massive
amount of new SDRs to the IMFs members. [18]
This is, interestingly, exactly what is
happening with Africa and the IMF now.
Former IMF Managing Director Jacques de Larosière recently stated
that the current financial crisis,
given its scope, presents a unique opening
to improve institutions, and there is already a danger that the chance
might be missed if the different actors cannot agree to changes by the
time economic growth resumes.
He is now an adviser with BNP Paribas, a
corporation highly represented at Bilderberg meetings, and he was head of
the Treasury of France when Valéry Giscard dEstaing was President of
France, who is a regular of the Bilderberg Group.[19]
The Guardian Covers
Bilderberg
The British paper, the Guardian, was the only major mainstream news
publication to provide ongoing coverage of the Bilderberg meeting over the
weekend.
His (Charlie Skelton)
first columns were satirical and
slightly mocking, referring to it as,
A long weekend at a luxury hotel, where the
world's elite get to shake hands, clink glasses, fine-tune their global
agenda and squabble over who gets the best sun loungers. I'm guessing
that
Henry Kissinger brings his own, has it
helicoptered in and guarded 24/7 by a CIA special ops team. [20]
However, as the weekend dragged on, his
reporting took a change of tone.
He reported on the Saturday that,
I know that I'm being followed. I know
because I've just been chatting to the plainclothes policemen I caught
following me, and he was arrested twice in the first day of the
meetings for attempting to take photographs as the limousines entered
the hotel.[21]
He later reported that he wasnt sure what they
were discussing inside the hotel, but that he has,
a sense of something rotten in the state of
Greece, and he further stated, Three days and I've been turned into a
suspect, a troublemaker, unwanted, ill at ease, tired and a bit afraid.
He then went on to write that,
Bilderberg is all about control. It's about
'what shall we do next?' We run lots of stuff already, how about we run
some more? How about we make it easier to run stuff? More efficient.
Efficiency is good. It would be so much easier with a single bank, a
single currency, a single market, a single government. How about a
single army? That would be pretty cool. We wouldn't have any wars then.
This prawn cocktail is GOOD. How about a single way of thinking? How
about a
controlled internet?, and then, How
about not.
He makes a very astute point, countering the
often postulated argument that Bilderberg is simply a forum where people
can speak freely, writing:
I am so unbelievably backteeth sick of
power being flexed by the few. I've had it flexed in my face for three
days, and it's up my nose like a wasp. I don't care whether the
Bilderberg Group is planning to save the world or shove it in a blender
and drink the juice, I don't think politics should be done like this,
and the author, Charlie Skelton, eloquently stated, If they were
trying to cure cancer they could do it with the lights on.
He further explained that,
Bilderberg is about positions of control. I
get within half a mile of it, and suddenly I'm one of the controlled.
I'm followed, watched, logged, detained, detained again. I'd been put in
that position by the 'power' that was up the road. [22]
On Sunday, May 17, Skelton reported that when he
asked the police chief why he was being followed, the chief responded
asking,
Why you here? to which Skelton said he was
there to cover the Bilderberg conference, after which the chief stated,
Well, that is the reason! That is why! We are finished! [23]
Do reporters get followed around and stalked by
police officers when they cover the World Economic Forum? No. So why does it
happen with Bilderberg if all it is, a conference to discuss ideas
freely?
On the Monday following the conference, Skelton wrote that,
It isn't just me who's been hauled into
police custody for daring to hang around half a mile from the hotel
gates. The few journalists who've made the trip to Vouliagmeni this year
have all been harassed and harried and felt the business end of a Greek
walkie-talkie. Many have been arrested. Bernie, from the American Free
Press, and Gerhard the documentarian (sounds like a Dungeons and Dragons
character) chartered a boat from a nearby marina to try to get photos
from the sea. They were stopped three miles from the resort. By the
Greek navy.
As Skelton said himself,
My dispatches on the 2009 conference, if
they mean anything at all, represent nothing more acutely than the
absence of thorough mainstream reporting. [24]
Skeltons final report on Bilderberg from May
19, showed how far he had gone in his several days of reporting on the
meeting. From writing jokingly about the meeting, to discovering that he
was followed by the Greek State Security force.
Skelton mused,
So who is the paranoid one? Me, hiding in
stairwells, watching the pavement behind me in shop windows, staying in
the open for safety? Or Bilderberg, with its two F-16s, circling
helicopters, machine guns, navy commandos and policy of repeatedly
detaining and harassing a handful of journalists? Who's the nutter? Me
or Baron Mandelson? Me or Paul Volker, the head of Obama's economic
advisory board? Me or the president of Coca-Cola?
Skelton stated that,
Publicity is pure salt to the giant slug of
Bilderberg. So I suggest next year we turn up with a few more tubs. If
the mainstream press refuses to give proper coverage to this massive
annual event, then interested citizens will have to: a people's media.
Amazingly, Skelton made the pronouncement that
what he learned after the Bilderberg conference, was that,
we must fight, fight, fight, now right
now, this second, with every cubic inch of our souls to stop identity
cards, as, It's all about the power to ask, the obligation to show,
the justification of one's existence, the power of the asker over the
subservience of the asked.
He stated that he,
learned this from the random searches,
detentions, angry security goon proddings and thumped police desks
without number that I've had to suffer on account of Bilderberg: I have
spent the week living in a nightmare possible future and many different
terrible pasts. I have had the very tiniest glimpse into a world of spot
checks and unchecked security powers. And it has left me shaken. It has
left me, literally, bruised.
Pointedly, he explains that,
The identity card turns you from a free
citizen into a suspect. [25]

odd turn of events, considering that the Federal Reserve Governor is always
present at Bilderberg meetings, alongside the President of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, William C. Dudley.
I have contacted the New York Fed inquiring if
Dudley visited Greece or went to any meetings in Greece between May 14-17,
or if another senior representative from the New York Fed went in his stead.

Conclusion
Clearly, it was the prerogative of this years Bilderberg meeting to exploit
the global financial crisis as much as possible to reach goals they have
been striving toward for many years. These include the creation of a
Global Treasury Department, likely in conjunction with or embodied in
the same institution as a Global Central Bank, both of which seem to
be in the process of being incorporated into the IMF.
Naturally, Bilderberg meetings serve the interests of the people and
organizations that are represented there.
Due to the large amount of representatives from
the Obama administration that were present, US policies revolving around the
financial crisis are likely to have emerged from and serve the interests of
the Bilderberg Group. Given the heavy representation of Obamas foreign
policy establishment at the Bilderberg meeting, it seemed surprising to not
have received any more information regarding US foreign policy from this
years meeting, perhaps having to do with Pakistan and Afghanistan.
However, the US recently decided to fire the general who oversaw the Afghan
war, being replaced with,
Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a
former Green Beret who recently commanded the military's secretive
special operations forces in Iraq. [35]
From 2003 to 2008, McChrystal,
led the Pentagon's Joint Special
Operations Command (JSOC), which oversees the military's most
sensitive forces, including the Army's Delta Force, and who
Pulitzer-Prize winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh
singled out as the head of
VP Cheneys 'executive assassination wing'.
[36]
So, given these recent changes, as well as the
high degree of representation Obamas foreign policy establishment held at
Bildebrerg this year, there were likely to have been some decisions or at
least discussion of the escalation of the Afghan war and expansion into
Pakistan. However, it is not surprising that the main item on the agenda was
the
global financial crisis.
Without a doubt, the next year will be an
interesting one, and the elite are surely hoping to make it a productive
one.

APPENDIX 2 - Creating
a Central Bank of the World
Jeffrey Garten, Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade in
the Clinton administration, former Dean of the Yale School of Management,
previously served on the White House Council on International Economic
Policy under the Nixon administration and on the policy planning staffs of
Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Cyrus Vance of the Ford and Carter
administrations.
He also was a managing director of Lehman
Brothers and the Blackstone Group, is also a member of the Council on
Foreign Relations. As early as 1998, Garten wrote an article for the New
York Times in which he advocated the creation of a global central
bank.[39]
Amid the current financial crisis, Garten wrote an article for the
Financial Times in which he advocated for,
the establishment of a Global Monetary
Authority to oversee markets that have become borderless, acting as a
global central bank.[40]
In late October, Garten wrote an article for
Newsweek in which he said that world,
leaders should begin laying the groundwork
for establishing a global central bank. [41]
Three days after the publication of Gartens
Newsweek article, it was reported that,
The International Monetary Fund may soon
lack the money to bail out an ever growing list of countries crumbling
across Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia, raising
concerns that it will have to tap taxpayers in Western countries for a
capital infusion or resort to the nuclear option of printing its own
money.
Further,
The nuclear option is to print money
by issuing Special Drawing Rights, in effect acting as if it were
the world's central bank. [42]

global central bank, regional currencies, a global reserve currency and a
world governing body, see:
