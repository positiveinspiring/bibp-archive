The average American family today carries 10 credit cards. Credit card debt
and personal bankruptcies are now at an all time high.
With no legal limit on the amount of interest or
fees that can be charged, credit cards have become the most profitable
sector of the American banking industry: more than $30 billion in profits
last year alone. FRONTLINE examines how the credit card industry became so
pervasive, so lucrative, and so powerful.
