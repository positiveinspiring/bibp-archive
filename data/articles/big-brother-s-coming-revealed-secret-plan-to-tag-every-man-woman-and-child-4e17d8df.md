CODED MICROCHIPS implanted in every person in the country would tie all of
us into a master computer that could track anyone down at any moment, and
plans for such a system are already under way whether you like it or not!
The secret scheme is being touted as a service for the protection of the
people by high government officials, but some insiders who object to the
move say it's just another way for Big Brother to control its subjects.
Transmitters
"Top-level national security agents are
trying to convince sources in the
Bush Administration to begin the
project in which every man, woman and child will be implanted with a
tiny transmitter," claims Davis Milerand, a critic of government
intervention who says he has received leaked information from inside
sources.
"They're trying to say this will be a good way for authorities to
quickly track down missing persons and children, as well as criminals
and spies."
Injections
"But with the astounding technology of
today, everything about you could be contained in one tiny microchip,
which would be connected to a government computer.
"Any government agency will know what any person has done and is doing
at any time."
Other sources say the tiny transmitters can be
injected painlessly from a tiny gun in humans without them even knowing it
through a nationwide
vaccination program.
"All the government would have to do is make
up something like the
swine flu vaccine," Milerand says.
"Imagine if they said there was a vaccine for AIDS. People would rush in
droves to get shots.
"The doctors themselves may not even know what they're injecting. They
could be told the microchips are genetic implants that reprogram the
body into fighting disease."
He adds:
"The program would require all federal,
state and local government workers to undergo the injections."
"It would only be a matter of time before everyone is implanted with a
microchip, a slave to the government."
