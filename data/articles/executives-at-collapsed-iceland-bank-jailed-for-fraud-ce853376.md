# Executives at Collapsed Iceland Bank Jailed for Fraud

All three of the small North Atlantic island's
top
banks collapsed in quick succession in October 2008 due to big
debts incurred during a rapid overseas expansion.
Glitnir was the first to fall after the collapse
of Lehman Brothers caused international credit
markets
to freeze up.
A Reykjavik court sentenced Glitnir's former
chief executive, Larus Welding, and former head of corporate finance,
Gudmundur Hjaltason, each to nine months in jail, of which six months were
suspended for two years. They had denied the charges.
Prosecutors said the two approved a loan to a
company which owned shares in Glitnir so that the company could in turn
repay a
debt to
Morgan Stanley.
The decision, taken outside the regular
decision-making process, meant Glitnir was too exposed to the company and
cost the bank at least 53.7 million euros ($71 million), the prosecution
said.
The sentence was less than the jail terms of at
least five years demanded by Iceland's special prosecutor, who is looking
into alleged wrongdoing connected to the crisis.
"We have a conviction, which is of course
the main thing," prosecutor Holmsteinn Sigurdsson told reporters outside
the courtroom when asked whether he was disappointed with the length of
the sentence.
The special prosecutor is also looking into
alleged wrongdoing linked to the collapse of the other two former top
banks,
Landsbanki and
Kaupthing.
