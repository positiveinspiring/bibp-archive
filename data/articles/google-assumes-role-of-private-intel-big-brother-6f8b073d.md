Online giant Google will have eyes everywhere, including your wallet and
spending habits!
The company plans to start a new service that
will combine online intelligence with offline consumer data. So, Google will
make it possible for advertisers to target clients. The search engine will
offer advertising companies an access to peoples Web and real life
activities.
A few days ago, Google announced the launch of a new ad project called
Conversions API. The service will allow companies to make profiles of their
users using not only their Internet search history, but also their in-store
shopping activities.
On its website
DoubleClick Search, Google said that users
online data can only provide a limited amount of information to businesses.
The company added that advertisers also need real-life information about
consumers.
That led the giant to create a beta version of its Conversions API which
will be used for automatic storing of offline conversions. The new service
will keep track of users calls, in-store transactions, as well as different
online actions. This information will be mixed with other data so that
advertisers can receive better consumers statistics.
According
to Google, the new service will be
anonymous and it will be completely safe.
However, even though it will protect peoples
privacy, this project is somewhat disturbing.
Facebook activities are also disturbing for
many, so as Amazons. Tracking your every step is something not many
consumers would like. Imagine, for example, that you go to a store and you
buy a product of a certain brand using your credit card.
Google will track that and the next time you
open its website you will see much more ads for this brand.
Amazon, for example, sends tailor-made email
offers for products you have been viewing recently. Sometimes, this practice
is welcomed, but sometimes it could be described as intruding and pushy.
So far, there is no guarantee that users information collected by Google
wont get in the hand of third parties. Despite being protected, the data
can someday be accessed by a sneaky hacker.
The possibility of selling or exchanging such
data seems so dangerous that we are not even attempting to discuss it - you
can imagine by yourself the consequences.
In addition, it is now clear that Google doesnt offer this information only
to its advertisers. In November it was reported that the search engine gave
the U.S. government private information of about 8,000 users. That was only
for the first part of 2012.
Insiders from Google commented that this was
not the first time when they 'help' a government.
