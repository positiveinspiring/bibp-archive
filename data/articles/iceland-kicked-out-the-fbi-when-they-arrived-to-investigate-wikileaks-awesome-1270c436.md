Now this is one of those
events where you jump up and say "F YEAH!"
When the Minister of the
Interior of Iceland found out that FBI had arrived in a
private jet at the airport to
investigate Wikileaks,
he got right on it and
kicked them OUT of the Country of Iceland!
He said they
were not welcomed in Iceland and made them leave!
This
happened in 2011 but the information about it is just being
released today.
From
the recovered article through
GoogleCached:
A group of FBI agents arrived in Iceland
in August 2011, requesting collaboration with Icelandic
police authorities to investigate Wikileaks, as revealed
by Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson on RÚVs
news magazine Kastljós last night.
The FBI came here in a
private jet and landed at Reykjavík Airport.
According to my information - which is very solid
and I have had it confirmed - Minister of the
Interior Ögmundur Jónasson was notified of their
arrival and reacted angrily because it is
unbelievably presumptuous to come here this way,
Kristinn stated.
According to my
information, he demanded that these agents pack
their bags, embark the plane and leave the country,
Kristinn added.
I know that this was
later discussed within the government, which
formally objected to U.S. authorities.
Ögmundur confirmed
Kristinns statement to RÚV,
saying a group of foreign agents came to the country in
August 2011, requesting assistance to investigate a
certain affair.
Their request was rejected as it is
unnatural for foreign police forces to carry out
investigations in Iceland, the minister reasoned.
Here and
here are other articles
with the same information.
I would love to live in Iceland if it wasn't always so cold!
What a great country...
I have written about them
previously and how they
convicted the bankers for the collapse.
