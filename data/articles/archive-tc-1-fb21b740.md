Overview of The Situation last updated - January 11, 2007
from ArchiveTC Website
This document has been written in order to provide what will hopefully be a clear and comprehensive overview of a revolutionary movement that is starting to take shape throughout the world, fueled in part by a growing amount of individuals across the globe who are starting to develop (or were born with) all kinds of mysterious powers, such as the ability to see spirits as well as auras around living beings (due to their capacity to perceive matter and light that is located in higher frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum), to have detailed visions (including in some cases visions of their own past lives), to free their own spirit from their body and travel to other worlds and dimensions, to communicate with beings living in those worlds as well as with people who have died, and many other intriguing powers depending on each of these individuals... Along the way, besides exploring the limits of human potential, many of them also had the chance to receive a wide range of profound teachings from the beings they met in the course of their journey beyond our world, and according to some of the individuals behind this movement.
One of their main objectives at the moment is to now share this information and this knowledge with the rest of humanity, in order to, hopefully, bring eventually the progress and the evolution of the human species on a wide range of levels (including genetically), and ultimately, bring about a vast transformation and the redemption of this very world we live in.
Well, in order to better understand what this is all about, here's an overview of some of the concepts that they have learned about, as well as the philosophy that many of the individuals behind this movement have in common:
First of all, that we are all living in what some of them call "the Matrix" not a virtual world created by machines as in the movies of the same name but rather in the sense that humanity has been living for quite a while in its own little world, trapped and imprisoned in a vast and intricate system keeping us under control, unfortunately unaware for the most part of the true nature of reality and of what is truly going on out there beyond this mysterious world we live in... That it is also becoming quite important for humanity to realize that we are far from being alone in the Universe... According to some of these individuals, one of the most important pieces of the puzzle that had been missing in our comprehension of it is that the Universe turns out to be composed of many levels, and that the world we can see all around us is not all there is, that it is only one of the layers (apparently the lowest one) in that huge multilayered universe that we find ourselves in... In other words, that there are several parallel universes (parallel worlds, or parallel dimensions) interpenetrating ours, each one of these higher levels being located in a distinct frequency band, or octave, if you will, and that these parallel worlds can even be visited during out-of-body experiences... Apparently, there is also at the very highest level of the Universe what some of them call "the Source" (God?), where the highest energies originate from... That outer space is heavily populated by all kinds of lifeforms, and that there are even advanced civilizations on other planets of our solar system, but that these civilizations are located in higher levels of the Universe, which is the reason why from our perspective these planets seem to be devoid of life... According to their information, there are even civilizations within the Earth itself in some of these parallel universes... That the Universe has a very long and fascinating history, and that several different species, civilizations, federations and councils exist, each with their own objectives and agendas... In addition to that, that there has been throughout history several conflicts and wars in outer space between some of them, but that there is also a huge confederation in our galaxy that is working to bring and maintain peace... That there is a wide variety of energy currents flowing throughout the Universe what some of these individuals call "the Force", just like in the Star Wars series and that people can learn to manipulate it with their minds as well as through breathing (which is considered by some as the foundation and the key to unleash many of our latent powers), and use it for various purposes, such as healing, replenishing their energy (by breathing more deeply), raising their own frequency, tuning in and perceiving stuff located in higher frequency bands, as well as many other things... That all living beings are surrounded by some kind of energy field (what is often called the aura), and that in a similar way to a radio emitter, our minds are constantly broadcasting all kinds of stuff (which apparently flows through the airwaves, thus, through the Force), causing a lot of "mental pollution" on Earth because of all the heavy emotions and thoughts being emitted by people, such as fear, anger and hatred... Some also say that very profound changes could happen if more people throughout the world would start to intend in their minds to connect to the Source and then breathe deeply as much as possible in order to absorb and emit powerful waves of energy (especially feelings of love, which is considered the most powerful force and purest, highest-frequency energy that exists), which would apparently generate and anchor massive quantities of light (a form of high frequency light that humans usually can't perceive), which would then in turn help greatly in clearing and dispelling all of those dark and polluting currents of energy flowing around, create an immensely powerful force throughout the world, boost the energy level of the Earth, increase the overall global frequency, and hopefully, uplift our world out of the mess it's in, outside of the low frequency band that keeps us out of reach from those in the higher dimensions who want to come help us out, and at the same time progressively help to transform the entire world and help free humanity from those who are trying to control it... That many beings in higher levels/dimensions of the Universe have used humanity as a huge source of energy, which in this case seems to be reflected symbolically in the Matrix series... Apparently, many humans actually have etheric implants and cables plugged into them (which are invisible, as they are allegedly composed of matter located in a high frequency band), and apparently many even have vampire-like patterns encoded within their genetic code, meaning by this that they tend to suck the energy out of others without being aware of it, and in some other cases, people can apparently also attack others energetically without knowing it... That there are powerful criminal organizations on Earth with a lot of money and resources who have infiltrated many facets of the system (corporations, governments, military, etc), who are apparently trying to keep humanity subdued and are formulating plans to eventually take control of the entire world... (sometimes referred to as the "New World Order") Also, that there are many secret underground bases throughout the world, many forms of mind control going on behind the scenes, as well as many agents of this system (working for various agencies) who are working to protect it, maintain their control over the world, and even get rid in some cases of people who are interfering with their plans... That the Earth is actually a living being, that she is very slowly and progressively transforming/evolving into a star, and that she is currently surrounded by several huge fleets of ships that are located in a vast range of levels (layers, parallel dimensions, or whatever you want to call it), many of them being part of the huge confederation that was mentioned earlier, and that these ships are protecting the Earth and are attentively monitoring the situation in our world, among many other things... That there is also a huge mission currently underway to try to free the world, wake up humanity and bring to people a deeper understanding of the situation we're in and what's actually going on behind the scenes... According to some reports, many animal species on Earth (such as dolphins) also have a profound hope that humanity will soon wake up and hopefully put an end to all of the cruelty and horror they are inflicting upon other living beings, and upon the Earth itself... That our world here on Earth has been kept in quarantine for quite a while, and that the people onboard these ships surrounding the Earth are actually planning to establish contact with humanity and achieve their mission as soon as it is possible, but it seems that many things needs to be taken care of first, in order to make sure that the armies of our world will not attack them, and that people will not panic and understand that they are actually here to help us out (by introducing us to very advanced technology, to help purify the environment, to provide new and clean energy sources, as well as several other things), and eventually, to finally welcome humanity into the Universe's huge community... That many of the beings onboard these ships are humans quite similar to us, but that there are also people from various other species and civilizations that are working together up there... It's apparently possible to even go onboard some of these ships during out-of-body experiences... (note: it would probably be a good idea for some people in our society to be trained so that they can learn to get in touch with them, and even possibly become ambassadors eventually for humanity) That some crew members from these ships are currently incarnated in our world, (and not just crew members of ships, but also beings from all over the Universe, from various other worlds, planets, dimensions, etc), born as normal human beings on Earth, down here in the Matrix, but that unfortunately the vast majority of them are unaware at the moment of who they truly are... Apparently, there are even angels as well as fairies and several other kinds of spirits who are also currently incarnated in our world as normal humans living their daily lives, oblivious as well to their true nature... That there is definitely life after death, and that the body is apparently just a vehicle in which our spirit lives... (the body is also considered as some kind of biocomputer, with its own operating system, containing various programs and circuits, and the ability to access, download and upload with one's mind many forms of data, information and energy) Also, that there are many invisible spirits in our world (according to some reports, there are all kinds out there, such as angels, archangels, a broad range of beings from higher dimensions, spirits of people who have died, and even various kinds of nature spirits, such as fairies), but that most people unfortunately can't see or perceive them at the moment as these beings are composed of matter that is in a frequency range that our senses can't usually perceive... That most people had past lives on other planets and in other worlds and dimensions, and that for some people, it is actually their first time down here on Earth, while some others have been here for quite a long time... Apparently also some of the most ancient beings in the Universe are currently incarnated in this world to provide their assistance in bringing an end to this horrible nightmare down here and to propel us all toward the much-awaited golden age of humanity... That there are oracles in our world, people who have the ability to relay information from beings in higher dimensions, to guide people, sometimes do remote viewing, and even in some cases allow a being from an higher dimension to speak through them or even temporarily take control of their entire body in order to pass a message... (what is better known as "channeling") That humanity carries quite an heavy heritage genetically, and that several great civilizations have flourished upon the Earth throughout history (such as Atlantis and Lemuria, among some others that are even more ancient), but that most people are not aware of them at the moment... That our genetic code contains much more important stuff than we might think (in what is sometimes referred to by scientists as 'junk DNA'), and that apparently, we are at this very moment at the dawn of the next step in the evolution of the human species... According to some of the information that has emerged, there are people throughout the world among this movement who have gained the ability to progressively upgrade and purify their own genetic code through the power of their minds, by breathing deeply, and the use of the Force (sometimes through a form of abreaction, though all of this is apparently not an easy process), and that some of them are currently working hard on upgrading it back to something closer to how humans were a very long time ago genetically, before the downfall of the human species, when our DNA was hacked, according to some sources... (which, as well as unlocking many our our latent powers such as those mentioned in the introduction of this document, will apparently bring a profound modification of the human body, such as new glands, a crystalline cellular structure, and many other profound changes...) That eventually, new generations of children with much more advanced genetic code will be born from these people, bringing forth new lineages, and that as the human gene pool purifies itself, diseases will progressively disappear and that eventually the lifespan of humans on Earth will become MUCH longer, compared to what it is these days... That even higher levels of evolution and enlightenment can be attained by purifying ourselves and progressively getting rid of many of the patterns and memories buried within our genetic code, thus having one's energy field progressively grow larger, glowing brighter, and eventually reach deeper states of pure compassion and unconditional love for all living beings... Apparently, the final and ultimate step of evolution in our world is then ascension itself, where a person's body turns into pure energy and gains the ability to move on to the next level, in other words, to disappear entirely from this world and pass on to the next level, in the parallel universe above ours... According to some reports, some humans will probably begin to achieve this huge feat in the next generations to come...
First of all, that we are all living in what some of them call "the Matrix" not a virtual world created by machines as in the movies of the same name but rather in the sense that humanity has been living for quite a while in its own little world, trapped and imprisoned in a vast and intricate system keeping us under control, unfortunately unaware for the most part of the true nature of reality and of what is truly going on out there beyond this mysterious world we live in...
