# The BRICS "Independent Internet" Cable - In Defiance of the "US-Centric 
Internet"

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_internet158.htm

The President of Brazil,
Dilma Rousseff announces publicly the creation of a world
internet system INDEPENDENT from US and Britain ( the
"US-centric internet").
Not many understand that, while the immediate trigger for
the decision (coupled with the cancellation of a summit with
the US president) was the revelations on NSA spying, the
reason why Rousseff can take such a historic step is that
the alternative infrastructure:
The BRICS cable from
Vladivostock, Russia to Shantou, China to Chennai, India
to Cape Town, South Africa to Fortaleza, Brazil, is
being built and its, actually, in its final phase of
implementation.
No amount of provocation and
attempted "Springs" destabilizations and Color Revolution in
the Middle East, Russia or Brazil can stop this process.
The huge submerged part of the
BRICS plan is not yet known by the broader public.
Nonetheless it is very real and extremely effective. So real
that international investors are now jumping with both feet
on this unprecedented real economy opportunity.
The change
has already
happened.
