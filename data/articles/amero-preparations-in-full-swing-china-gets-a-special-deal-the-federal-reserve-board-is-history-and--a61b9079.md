Events continue to unfold at a blistering pace
behind the scenes in preparation for the second American Revolution.
As a part of this, the US dollar is going to be
replaced with a gold-backed
Amero at the rate of 2 dollars per one
Amero. The Chinese have refused to go along with this so they have been cut
a special deal but we are not privy to the details. However, we assume they
are getting lots of gold.
The
Federal Reserve Board will be dismantled although the financial
technicians who work for it may remain in place. Apart from that though,
many key decisions are expected to be made during some possibly very rough
horse-trading over the following few weeks.
There is still a lot of confusion and chaos in the corridors of Western
power.
However, the Pentagon and agency white-hats have been quietly approaching
members of the cabal one by one and asking them to step aside. The entire
process is now zooming in on Italy, the Italian
noble families like the Medici and the
Borgias,
the Vatican and over one trillion dollars worth of bonds.
The bonds, as we have reported before, are in the hands of Daniele Dal
Bosco and whatever organization it is that lies behind him. Dal Bosco
was supposed to help make these bonds available to develop
forbidden technology and help end poverty but instead absconded with
them.
For some reason, the entire show-down is now
zeroing in on the issue of cashing those bonds.
The obstacles now are a bogus organization known as
the OITC and the
hopelessly corrupt United Nations. The UN and the Vatican are now
starting to cooperate, though so this issue will be resolved before too
long. Raw intelligence about the OITC is available on my free website for
those who still think it represents anything legitimate.
When that trillion dollars is made available to humanity, it will open the
floodgates for an entire new way of running the planet. If the bonds are not
returned to their rightful owners, the bonds rightful owners will make them
null and void and issue an entire new set to replace them.
Clearly though, we are now in the last stages of flushing out the leadership
of the dark cabal. The people trying to prevent humanity from using that
money are being identified one by one. They will have no escape on this
planet.
Senior US government officials as well as military brass say the situation
is extremely touch and go. They point out that the problems created by the
Federal Reserve Board and their clandestine owners go back over 100 years
and will not be untangled overnight.
Military brass are also worried that if the United States public learns too
much of the truth, too quickly, there will be civil war. That is why the
series of meetings due in Washington over the coming weeks are so crucial.
This much is clear though,
the Obama presidency will not
continue, and he will not be replaced either by Vice
President Biden or by
Hillary Clinton. It will almost
certainly be someone from the Pentagon who takes over as interim president
until new governmental and constitutional structures can be put in place in
the US.
Europe, for its part, is expected to remain under dynastic family rule
because the European populace is too apathetic or indoctrinated to force
fundamental change.
In Japan, meanwhile, new facts about its recent history are coming to light
bit by bit.
Japanese security police and right wing sources
have shed new light on what happened to end Japans economic growth since
the 1990s. It appears that during the 1990s the Bank of Japan created 800
trillion fiat yen. Of this 400 trillion was given to Toyota motors. Toyota
used this money to create 17 banks around the world that continue to
function to this day.
The problem centers on the other 400 trillion yen. This was given to
Nakasone and presumably much of it founds its way into the hands of
the Trilateral Commission. Prime Ministers Obuchi and
Takeshita were too aggressive in trying to use this money and for that
reason they were ordered killed, according to these sources.
We also have learned more about the issue of the Japanese kidnapped by the
Americans.
According Korean war defector private Jenkins,
many of these Japanese were not kidnapped but instead were actively spying
on Japan for the North Koreans. Many of them visited Japan often using fake
passports.
The new revelations from the Japanese authorities also indicate that most of
the Japanese Prime Ministers since the end of World War 2 were originally of
North Korean descent. The two definite exceptions were Prime Ministers
Tanaka and Obuchi.
In any case, some US heavies will be talking to Nakasone and his cabal soon
and this will lead to an end to Japans colonial status. The Yakuza and the
right-wing are now aligning behind the changes. The critical issue, as
always, remains the issue of who controls the money printing presses and
this issue has not been fully resolved.
On the political front, the latest talk is that Prime Minister Kan
will be gone by September and replaced by power broker Ichiro Ozawa.
The yakua/police/military/right-wing nexus is not going to dig up some
scandal in an effort to remove him from power this time around because they
recognize Japan needs a strong leader at this time.
Most of the governments of the world now understand what is going and the
current crisis remains confined to the G7 countries. There will be
inevitable turbulence as the structures they set up to rule the world after
World War 2 are reconstituted.
The period between now and the September 31st US fiscal year end
will be turbulent and many incidents may occur around the world during the
final death throes of the dark cabal.
