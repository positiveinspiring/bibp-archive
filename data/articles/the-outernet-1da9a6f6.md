# The Outernet

In 2013 when
Typhoon Haiyan brought down most of the Philippines' cell and
radio towers, bringing information to a standstill at a crucial
moment.
The same thing happened again earlier
this month in Ukraine, but this time it was
men with political motives, not nature, that severed access to
the country's largest ISP.
But a fledgling system of Low Earth
Orbit satellites known as the
Outernet
might mean an end to outages like this - making constant up-time a
possibility, and with it, true human reliance on the Internet.
The question: Is that a good thing?
Four Billion People Have
No Access To The Internet
It may come as a shock to anyone reading
this article, online, right now, but as pervasive as the Internet is
in 2014, two-thirds of the world still does not - and never has had
- access to it.
That's almost 4 billion people who don't enjoy the
same access to the open and free information that you and I do.
That 60% doesn't even cover when man or
nature steps in to take the infrastructure out. We're just talking
about people living in places too remote, too costly, or too poverty
stricken to make it worthwhile setting up Internet infrastructure.
But more and more, access to information
seems like a basic human right, right up there with access to clean
water. And that's exactly the attitude of
Syed Karim, creator of the Outernet:
a free, universally
accessible information service that beams Internet information - be
it entire websites like Wikipedia, emergency broadcast messages, or
video classes from the Khan academy - to any Wi-Fi-enabled device
across the globe.
The Short Wave Radio For
The Digital Age
"We fundamentally believe that in order
for our species to advance - for humanity to get to the next step in
development - that no one can be denied a certain level of education
and information. If there is a curiosity it should be satiated,"
says Karim.
The Outernet is an ambitious project.
Using open source hardware and software Karim and his team will
launch hundreds of nano satellites into Low Earth Orbit in 2016.
These satellites will encircle the planet delivering packets of
information, much the way BitTorrent does now, to anyone on the
globe as long as they have a Wi-Fi-enabled device.
"I've been thinking about this problem
for almost seven years," Karim says.
"I started actively working on
it about four years ago. I originally enrolled in graduate school
with the desire to pursue a PhD in the economic impact of
information access.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
had just brought a satellite Internet link to the island nation of
Sao Tome and Principe. I was fascinated by the idea of measuring the
positive social and economic impact that increased access to digital
information had on a society."
But it's only after Karim left graduate
school and began working for Chicago Public Radio that his idea
fully took shape.
"I was asked to head product development
at Chicago Public Radio (now Chicago Public Media), which is where I
began exploring data-casting in more detail."
It is data-casting that lies at the
heart of Outernet and it's also why Karim's solution is so much less
expensive and easier to deploy than other global Internet networks
like Facebook's
internet.org and Google's
Project Loon.
Outernet is a one-way platform. It will
broadcast free data to any Wi-Fi device on the planet but will not,
at first, allow those receiving the broadcasts to broadcast back.
"Our initial focus is on solving a very
specific problem: lack of access to a basic level of information and
education for all of humanity," Karim says.
"Outernet is not the
Internet. It is simply the fastest and least expensive way to
deliver rich content to the large fraction of humanity who cannot
afford the information that many take for granted.
Once that is
addressed, then we'll work on the more complicated - and
significantly more expensive - task of providing low-cost two-way
Internet access."
But that one-way information is nothing
to scoff at.
For the first time ever an additional 4 billion people
could be able to receive, download, and store data locally on any
Wi-Fi device. Users could then share this data with other owners of
Wi-Fi devices via ad hoc device-to-device networks - no Internet
connection required.
Such a way of receiving one-direction
data no doubts lends comparisons of Outernet to short wave radio,
but it is much more versatile than that.
While shortwave radio
requires active listeners during a live broadcast and offers no way
to send that broadcast to other listeners, the Outernet allows
people to download large packets of data in the form of any kind of
digital content - be it videos or entire websites - and share it
with anyone with a Wi-Fi device.
The humanitarian and political
implications of this are huge. In a natural disaster scenario, like
the Philippine typhoon, Outernet could have easily broadcast entire
websites full of medical and rescue advice to victims across the
country.
In Ukraine it could have enabled those in the resistance
movement to share up-to-date information from one Wi-Fi device to
the next, no matter if Russian sympathizers took down all of the
country's ISPs.
The Internet Protocol
For Outer Space
Of course before Outernet can broadcast
web data to any Wi-Fi device on the globe the team leading the
ambitious project has several objectives to overcome from both a
hardware and software perspective.
The first is getting hundreds of
nano-satellites into space.
When I express my amazement over the fact
that a small startup is trying to launch satellites - something I
presume only large, very rich multinationals or governments have the
capability to do - Aaron Rogers, head of Outernet's Mission
Engineering, says this task is actually relatively simple.
"We're going to fully exercise a global
resource network of secondary and tertiary opportunistic rideshare
opportunities that are being offered through third-party integration
service providers," he says.
In other words, there's satellites going
up into space all the time and because of it, even smaller companies
can often hitch a ride on space shuttles to get their gear up into
space along with the Big Boy's stuff. Yes, even you reading this
could get a satellite up in the air.
Here's a
schedule for the next open rideshares.
But before the satellites go up,
Outernet will be testing its data-casting technology on the
International Space Station.
That's because, unlike the terrestrial
Internet, which sends standardized packets of data consistently and
reliably from one point to another over the Internet Protocol (IP)
standard, data signals beamed from space are prone to suffering from
packet disruption because receivers on Earth are trying to talk to
small spacecraft traveling at thousands of miles per hour overhead
for five or so minutes at a time before suffering potential data
disruptions due to the constantly moving paths of satellites along
their orbits.
But Edward Birrane, head of Telecom
Protocols at Outernet, says the system will use a new communications
technology called Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) that is
being researched by the space agencies of the world as a way to
standardize packetized data for space links.
"These protocols and techniques give an
Internet-like data exchange to spacecraft, allowing Outernet ground
systems to patiently accumulate data over multiple passes, over
multiple days, or over multiple weeks without fear of timeouts,
expired networking sessions, or powering on-and-off the ground
terminal," Birrane says.
"For the Outernet datacasting solution,
telecommunications protocols such as DTN give the needed ability to
stitch together large files - such as Wikipedia entries - as they
are received bit-by-bit from those fast-travelling spacecraft."
The resulting way web data will then be
delivered to Outernet users can perhaps best be likened to
technology dating back to the 1990s, according to Branko Vukelic,
software developer at Outernet.
"Sometime around the turn of the century
I used to have an Internet connection through a regular modem that
could run at speeds of around 30-something kbps," Vukelic says.
"I
used a web crawler, I think it was HTTrack but I could be mistaken,
to download entire sites during the night, and create offline
archives that could run on a local server without Internet
connection. That was necessary in order to keep the phone line free
during the day.
It's hard to claim 'those were the days,' but at
that time, it worked pretty well for me. Outernet isn't so different
from this."
Indeed it isn't.
The crawling and
compiling web data will be done by Outernet's software, with the end
result being a downloadable archive that would be served to all
devices on a local network. The end user would only filter out
content they want to discard, and manage the rest on their local
archive.
The more one learns about Outernet it's
hard not to appreciate all the ingenuity that went in to hacking a
grand-scale humanitarian technological idea into place.
But there's
one lingering question that arises:
If Outernet only broadcasts web
data to users, who chooses which data is made available?
Open Source,
Community-Driven Content
The answer to who chooses content for
four billion people when they themselves have no means of browsing
and selecting it independently, Vukelic says, is a community driven
group of editors, like Wikipedia has, and a community of voters,
like Reddit has - only on a much larger scale.
"The first piece that we will build is
the content selection and discovery system (CSDS for short). The
system has two purposes," Vukelic says.
"One is content selection,
which is facilitated through weighted voting systems, and another is
content discovery. Since end users don't necessarily have access to
search engines, the system would have to present a request, and have
the community find and suggest adequate content."
The CSDS voting system will allow anyone
with an Internet connection to submit content they think should be
shared. The community of voters can then "vote up" content, with the
web content with the most votes chosen to be broadcast over Outernet.
Vukelic admits that the system does have
its challenges.
After all, how do you create fair and inclusive
content selection process? One possibility under consideration is a
weighted voting system that gives more weight to votes in a specific
geographic area.
For example, if another hurricane hits the
Philippines, votes from people who live in the surrounding area may
be given more weight for which content to broadcast next.
"We want to give more strength to the
voices of actual Outernet end users, but we also don't want to leave
out people who want to help them.
While end users should have more
say in what they want to see/read/hear, people who are not
necessarily end users might know more about the content end users
don't," Vukelic says.
Outernet's CSDS will be a mix of web
app, API, and mashups that will funnel all input into its database
and manage the presentation of requests and votes. The company will
start with the web app and API components using Google AppEngine as
its base, and Python as the language of the choice.
It also plans to
provide a full API to allow third-party developers to come up with
new ways to vote, and not just rely on its own UI.
"The entire system should be usable,
within its technical constraints, by as many people as possible, and
especially the users that otherwise have no alternative," Vukelic
says.
"Missing an uplink capability, we need to find alternative
ways for end users on the ground to give us meaningful feedback. We
will look into everything and anything that lets us do this,
including accepting community-transcribed voice messages or scanned
handwritten mail, and anything else we can think of.
Carrier
pigeons? No method of requesting content should be too crazy for Outernet."
Getting Ready to Launch
Once Outernet comes on air it will
deliver web data to the two-thirds of the planet that has never
accessed the Internet.
The data will not only include a complete
copy of some of the greatest collections of human knowledge, like
Wikipedia in its entirety, but international and local news, crop
prices for farmers, and educational course content from Khan
Academy, Open Source Ecology, and Teachers Without Borders.
It will
also be used as a global notification system for emergency
communications to help coordinate disaster relief and provide the
free flow of information in war-torn or dictatorial countries.
That's the plan, anyway.
But while Outernet's launch in 2016 is only a few short years away, founder
Syed Karim admits that there are plenty of steps his team still
needs to achieve to get Outernet - what he calls "basically a
monster-sized version of Flipboard" - into space.
But he's confident
his team is up for the challenge - and the goal is worth pursuing.
"Imagine if everyone in the world had
access to the latest resources for learning, constantly updated,"
Karim says.
"And now imagine that this is available for free. What
does the future of humanity look like when a basic level of
information and education is available to everyone? I don't know
what it looks like, but I really want to find out."
