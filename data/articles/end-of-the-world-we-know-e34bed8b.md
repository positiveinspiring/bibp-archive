As everyone is well aware, Europe is an absolute
mess.
The gravity of the global debt crisis is getting
worse and for sure its the end of the world as we have known it.
EU trade
commissioner Karel De Gucht recently said,
The endgame has begun, and how it will
finish I do not know.
There is an implosion happening in Greece, and
Spain is not far behind with Portugal and Ireland running neck and neck into
the full embrace of depression and life-shattering bank runs.
Greece is a big deal and Spain is even bigger. Right now the European
Central Bank (ECB) is starting to cut off funds from several Greek banks and
there is a run going on at the same time. Those banks are going down the
toilet into a black hole and there will be a loud sucking sound as these
banks pull hard on other banks.
The Titanic is going down at the bow and just
because you are at the stern (in the United States), not in Spain or Greece,
it does not mean the cold waters of economic calamity are not going to come
to the shores of your life.
Martin Weiss has a logical sequence that
forecasts the ruin of our current way of
life:
Forecast #4
The European Central Bank (ECB)
will kick its money printing presses
into overdrive and very, very soon.
Thats the only way they know how to react
to the riots on the streets, how to finance their budgets, how to rescue
their banks and save their own necks politically.
And if you think Europe is too far away from
your hometown to matter very much - too far away from Main Street USA -
think again, says Weiss.
Chris Martenson
said,
Well, my hat is off to the global central
planners for averting the next stage of the unfolding financial crisis
for as long as they have.
I guess theres some solace in having had a
nice break between the events of 2008/09 and today, which afforded us
all the opportunity to attend to our various preparations and enjoy our
lives.
Alas, all good things come to an end, and a
crisis rooted in too much debt with a nice undercurrent of
persistently high and rising energy costs was never going to be solved
by providing cheap liquidity to the largest and most reckless financial
institutions. And it has not.
Graham Summers, of Phoenix Capital
Research, just back from Europe
says,
The situation in Europe is bad
How BAD?
Well, France, Spain, and Germany have ALL implemented border controls.
Spain, France, and Germany can each close their borders for up to 30
days at any point if they so choose.
Why are they doing this? Because they know
that when the stuff hits the fan and the EU collapses (which it will in
the next few months) people are going to attempt to flee with their
money
so they have made it so that no one can get it
and no one can
get out,
A 1 billion run [$1.28 billion] on a recently nationalized Spanish
bank has sparked further fears that the 17-nation Eurozone is about to
implode.
The U.S. media has completely ignored this
story because the implications are truly horrifying: that the EU and its
banking system could very easily collapse in the coming months. After
all, there are already bank runs taking place in Spain and Greece. Once
things pick up steam NO ONE will be immune.
No less than Ben Bernanke has publicly
admitted that if the EU goes down, it will potentially take the U.S.
with it. Make no mistake, whats coming will be bigger and worse than
2008. Were talking about bank holidays, civil unrest, and the worse,
said Summers.
You think this is all to be taken lightly?
The Italian government does not think so and has
deployed 20,000 law enforcement officers to protect individuals and
sensitive sites. The government increased security last Thursday at 14,000
sites, and assigned bodyguards to protect 550 individuals after a nuclear
energy company official was shot and letter bombs directed to the tax
collection agency.
It really is the end of the world we know, or the beginning of that end.
Christians believe in the end of the world as a matter of course and the
world is giving them every reason to think that their beliefs are correct.
Our modern civilization is vulnerable from a number of different angles and
the insanity of the elite and centuries of financial manipulation and
control are smashing against the wealth of the masses and the very structure
of society.
I read that Homeland Security is preparing
for civil war, preparing
to fight the heavily armed American people and internal security agencies
have bought enough ammunition to kill everyone.
Never has a public been so heavily armed so
obviously the military and the police know it will take a lot to suppress
Americans.
But they are not the only ones itching for war. Forty-nine headless bodies
were dumped in Mexico and the idiots in Washington are still proud of their
war against drugs. Modern civilization has been at war with its own people
for a long while and now national governments are ready and set for war on a
broader scale.
In the China Sea its the Philippines facing off against the Chinese and now
we hear of a new unholy alliance in Israel that seems to have established a
war cabinet to go full out to war with Iran.
Russia and Putin are talking rough and I dont
think they are kidding about defending their interests from the mentally
deranged Europeans and Americans. Syria has joined the list of countries
being torn apart by civil war.
Financial Armageddon is inching closer and closer. The future for the first
world is already being written in Spain and Greece and even California,
places where the money is running out big time.
And the volcanoes and earthquakes just dont
stop. They just dont stop and the reports keep coming in.
John Rubino
said,
Europes leaders - that is to say German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and the bureaucrats running the various
Eurozone agencies from Brussels - have looked into the abyss and dont
like what they see.
Specifically, a default and departure by even a
relatively insignificant country like Greece might start a contagion
that cripples or destroys the whole Eurozone."
Paul Brodsky says,
The only way to deleverage is either to let
credit deteriorate or to print money. Clearly the politically expedient
way of deleveraging is to print money.
Central banks can chatter all they want
about not wanting to print money or wanting to keep the integrity of
their currencies, but, at the end of the day, they dont really have a
choice. They either have to manufacture more electronic credits and put
them in the banking system or they have to let their banking system
fail. That is just the reality.
There is one interconnected banking system
and they all have claims with each other. If German banks end up in
difficulty, it presents problems for U.S. banks."
California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has some
bad news:
His cash-strapped state isnt $9.2 billion
in the hole, as projected in January; the Golden State is actually
facing a yawning
$15.7 billion shortfall.
Conclusion
The business and financial community is not paying attention to
what is
happening in Fukushima and how that alone will ruin the plans of mice and
men.
Rich or poor, it makes little difference when we are challenged beyond our
capacity to respond. Assuming that life will go on as it has these past
decades is perhaps one of the greatest and most dangerous assumptions most
people are making today.
The mainstream news media feeds this almost
universally-shared assumption, so when this greatest-of-all bubbles bursts,
there will be hell to pay - that is for sure.
We are all going to have to turn our bows into more spiritual winds to
manage the major upheavals headed our way. Depending on who and where you
are, these major upheavals have already occurred leaving increasing millions
desperate and without hope.
The illusion of growth is fast fading and what
will take its place is an ugly depression with a threatened currency
collapse as trillions are printed to save the world from its own stupidity.
