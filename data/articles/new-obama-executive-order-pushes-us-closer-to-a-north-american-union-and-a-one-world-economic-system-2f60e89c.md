When it comes to
Barack Obama, one of the most important things to
understand is that he is
a committed globalist.
He firmly believes that more "global governance"
(the elite don't like to use the term "global government") will make the
world a much better place. Throughout his time in the White House, Obama has
consistently sought to strengthen international institutions such as
the
UN,
the IMF,
the World Bank and the WTO.
At every turn, Obama has endeavored to more
fully integrate America into the "global community".
Since he was elected, Obama has signed a whole
host of new international economic agreements. He regularly speaks of the
need for "cooperation" among
global religions and he has hosted a wide
variety of different religious celebrations at the White House.
Obama once stated (below video) that,
"all nations must come together to build a
stronger global regime".
If you do not want to live in a "global regime"
that is just too bad.
To globalists such as Obama, it is inevitable that the
United States of America will be merged into the emerging global system.
Just this week, Obama has issued a new executive
order that seeks to "harmonize" U.S. economic regulations with the rest of
the world. This new executive order is yet another incremental step that is
pushing us closer to
a North American Union and a one world economic system.
Unfortunately, most Americans have absolutely no idea what is happening.
The American people need to understand that Barack Obama is constantly
looking for ways to integrate the United States more deeply with the rest of
the world.
The globalization of the world economy has
accelerated under Obama, and this latest executive order represents a
fundamental change in U.S. economic policy. Now federal regulators will be
required to "harmonize" their work with the international community.
The following is how this new executive order
was assessed in a recent
Businessweek article...
Obamas order provides a framework to
organize scattered efforts to promote international regulatory
cooperation, the chambers top global regulatory official said today.
Todays executive order marks a paradigm shift for U.S. regulators by
directing them to take the international implications of their work into
account in a consistent and comprehensive way, Sean Heather, vice
president of the chambers Center for Global Regulatory Cooperation,
said in an e-mailed statement.
Members of the Obama administration are touting
this as a way to "reduce regulation", but the truth is that this is much
more about aligning ourselves with the rest of the world than anything else.
Obama's "Information Czar", Cass Sunstein,
authored a piece in the
Wall Street Journal on Monday in which he stressed the need to eliminate,
"unnecessary regulatory differences across nations" so that the United
States can compete more effectively in our "interdependent global economy".
The end result of this process will be that we
will now do things much more like how the rest of the world does things...
In an interdependent global economy, diverse
regulations can cause trouble for companies doing business across
national boundaries.
Unnecessary differences in countries' regulatory
requirements can cost money, compromising economic growth and job
creation. Think of divergent requirements for car headlights, or the
labeling of food, or standards for container sizes.
Recognizing this, President Obama's Jobs Council
has called for U.S. agencies to better align U.S. regulations with those of
our major trading partners.
And today the president is issuing an executive
order, "Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation," with a simple goal:
to promote exports, growth, and job creation by eliminating unnecessary
regulatory differences across nations.
But a one world economic system is not going to arrive overnight.
Initially,
it is much more likely that there will be a very strong push toward North
American integration first. The goal will be to shape North America into an
integrated regional economic unit similar to the EU.
Cass Sunstein
discussed how this new executive
order will affect North American integration on the White House website on
Tuesday...
The new Executive Order will build on work
that is already underway.
We have started close to home, with President
Obama launching Regulatory Cooperation Councils with Prime Minister
Harper of Canada and President Calderon of Mexico.
The Councils are implementing work plans to
eliminate or prevent the creation of unnecessary regulatory differences
that adversely affect cross-border trade; to streamline regulatory
requirements; and to promote greater certainty for the general public
and businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises, in the
regulation of food, pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, and other areas.
The United States and Canada released the
United States-Canada Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) Joint Action
Plan last December. In February, we announced the United States-Mexico
High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Council (HLRCC) Work Plan.
Most Americans have absolutely no idea how far
plans to integrate the United States, Canada and Mexico have advanced.
Last year, Barack Obama signed an agreement to create a "North American
security perimeter" and most Americans never even heard about it because
the
mainstream news networks almost entirely ignored it.
But this is exactly what the globalists want.
They don't want people to
become alarmed by these moves toward North American integration. In fact, a
document uncovered by Wikileaks shows that those involved in the effort to
integrate North America believe that an "incremental" approach is best.
Apparently they believe that small moves toward integration are less likely
to alarm the general population.
The following is from an article that
appeared
in The National Post last year...
The integration of North Americas economies
would best be achieved through an incremental approach, according to a
leaked U.S. diplomatic cable.
The cable, released through the WikiLeaks website and apparently written
Jan. 28, 2005, discusses some of the obstacles surrounding the merger of
the economies of Canada, the United States and Mexico in a fashion
similar to the European Union.
An incremental and pragmatic package of tasks for a new North American
Initiative (NAI) will likely gain the most support among Canadian
policymakers, the document said.
The economic payoff of the
prospective North American initiative
is available, but its size and
timing are unpredictable, so it should not be oversold.
If the people of Canada, the United States and
Mexico were told that there was a plan to merge all three economies, there
might be massive protests to stop it, and the globalists do not want that.
A few years ago, the "Security and Prosperity Partnership Of North America"
(SPP) that was being promoted by President
George W. Bush started to
generate quite a bit of negative publicity. That caused those seeking to
integrate the economies of North America to back off for a little while.
But as
an article by
Jerome Corsi last year detailed, the eventual goal is
to turn North America into another version of the eurozone.
That includes a common currency for North
America called
the "amero"...
The SPP in the administration of President
George W. Bush appeared designed to replicate the steps taken in Europe
over a 50-year period following the end of World War II to transform an
economic agreement under the European Common Market into a full-fledged
regional government, operating as the European Union, with its own
currency, the euro, functioning as the sole legitimate currency in what
has become known as the eurozone.
The concern under the SPP has been that the
North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, could be evolved into a
regional government, the North American Union, with a regional currency, the amero, designed to replace the U.S. dollar, the Mexican peso and the
Canadian dollar.
So will we ever see the "amero" replace the U.S. dollar?
Hopefully not.
If the globalists try to introduce the "amero", it would probably be after a
horrible financial crisis in which the U.S. dollar falls apart. The "amero"
would be heralded as the "solution" to the problems that were plaguing the
dollar.
If there ever is a move to get rid of the U.S. dollar for an international
currency of some kind, the American people will need to resist it with all
of their might.
The more integrated
the world becomes, the more likely it becomes that we
will see nightmarish global tyranny someday. It is very frightening to think
of what someone very evil might do if they had the chance to run the entire
planet.
Once our national sovereignty is gone, it will be incredibly difficult to
get back.
If the American people don't take a stand while
they still can, their children may wake up someday as citizens of a very
oppressive "global regime".
