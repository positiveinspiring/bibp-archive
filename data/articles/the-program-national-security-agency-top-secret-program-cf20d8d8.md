The filmmaker Laura Poitras profiles
William Binney,
a 32-year veteran of the National Security
Agency
who helped design a top-secret program he says
is broadly collecting Americans personal data.
It took me a few days to work up the nerve to
phone William Binney.
As someone
already a target"
of the United States government, I found it difficult
not to worry about the chain of unintended consequences I might unleash by
calling Mr. Binney, a 32-year veteran of the NSA (National Security Agency)
turned whistle-blower.
He picked up. I nervously explained I was a
documentary filmmaker and wanted to speak to him.
To my surprise he replied:
Im tired of my government harassing me and
violating the Constitution. Yes, Ill talk to you.
Two weeks later,
driving past the headquarters of the NSA
in Maryland, outside Washington,
Mr. Binney described details about
Stellar Wind, the N.S.A.s top-secret
domestic spying program begun after 9/11, which was so controversial that it
nearly caused top Justice Department officials to
resign in
protest, in 2004.
The decision must have been made in
September 2001, Mr. Binney told me and the cinematographer Kirsten
Johnson. Thats when the equipment started coming in.
In this Op-Doc, Mr. Binney explains how the
program he created for foreign intelligence gathering was turned inward on
this country.
He resigned over this in 2001 and began
speaking out publicly in the last year. He is among a group of NSA
whistle-blowers, including Thomas A. Drake, who have each risked everything
- their freedom, livelihoods and personal relationships - to warn Americans
about the dangers of NSA domestic spying.
To those who understand state surveillance as an
abstraction, I will try to describe a little about how it has affected me.
The United States apparently placed me on a
"watch-list in 2006 after I completed a film about the Iraq war.
I have
been detained at the border more than 40 times.
Once, in 2011, when I was stopped at John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York and asserted my First Amendment
right not to answer questions about my work, the border agent replied,
If you dont answer our questions, well
find our answers on your electronics.
As a filmmaker and journalist entrusted to
protect the people who share information with me, it is becoming
increasingly difficult for me to work in the United States.
Although I take
every effort to secure my material, I know the NSA has technical
abilities that are nearly impossible to defend against if you are targeted.
The 2008 amendments to the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which oversees the NSA
activities, are up for renewal in December.
Two members of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, Senators
Ron Wyden of Oregon and
Mark Udall of Colorado, both Democrats, are
trying to revise the amendments to insure greater privacy protections.
They have been warning about
"secret interpretations" of laws and backdoor loopholes that allow the
government to collect our private communications. Thirteen senators have
signed a letter expressing concern about a loophole in the law that
permits the collection of United States data.
The A.C.L.U. and other groups have also
challenged the constitutionality of the law, and the Supreme Court
will
hear arguments in that case on Oct. 29.
