By assigning covert action roles to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
it is as if the White House and Congress had legitimized the Ku Klux Klan
(KKK) to
operate globally.
That's because the CIA today resembles nothing so much as
the "Invisible Empire" of the KKK that once spread terror across the South
and Midwest. Fiery crosses aside, this is what the CIA is doing globally.
The CIA today is committing many of the same sort of gruesome crimes against
foreigners that the KKK once inflicted on Americans of color. The principal
difference is that the KKK consisted of self-appointed vigilantes who
regarded themselves as both outside and above the law when they perpetrated
their crimes.
By contrast, the CIA acts as the agent of the American
government, often at the highest levels, and at times at the direction of
the White House. Its crimes typically are committed in contravention of the
highest established international law such as the Charter of the United
Nations as well as the U.S. Constitution.
What's more, the "Agency," as it
is known, derives its funding largely from an imperialist-minded Congress;
additionally, it has no qualms about fattening its budget from drug money
and other illegal sources. It is a mirror-image of the lawless entity the
U.S. has become since achieving superpower status. And it is incredible that
the White House grants license to this violent Agency to commit its crimes
with no accountability.
The Ku Klux Klan was founded shortly after the end
of the U.S. Civil War. Klansman concealed their identities behind flowing
white robes and white hoods as they terrorized the newly emancipated blacks
to keep them from voting or to drive them from their property.
Allowing it to operate in secret literally gives the CIA the mythical Ring
of Gyges.
In Plato's
Republic, the owner of the ring had the power to become
invisible at will.
As Wikipedia puts it,
Plato "discusses whether a typical
person would be moral if he did not have to fear the consequences of his
actions."
The ancient Greeks made the argument, Wikipedia says, that,
"No man
would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what
he liked out of the market, go into houses and lie with any one at his
pleasure, kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects be
like a god among men."
The CIA, like Hitler's
Gestapo and Stalin's
NKVD
before it, has provided modern man the answer to this question. Its actions
illuminate why all criminal entities, from rapists and bank robbers, to
Ponzi scheme swindlers and murderers, cloak themselves in secrecy.
There are innumerable examples of how American presidents have authorized
criminal acts without public discussion that the preponderant majority of
Americans would find reprehensible.
Example:
it was President Lyndon Johnson
who ordered the CIA to meddle in Chile's election to help Eduardo Frei
become president. If they had known, U.S. taxpayers might have objected to
such a use of their hard-earned money to influence the outcome of another
country's elections. But the public is rarely let in on such illegal foreign
policy decisions.
Where the KKK after the Civil War terrorized blacks to keep them from
voting, the CIA has worked to influence the outcome of elections all over
the world through bribery and vote-buying, dirty tricks, and worse.
According to investigative reporter William Blum in "Rogue State", the CIA has perverted elections in,
-
Italy
-
Lebanon
-
Indonesia
-
The Philippines
-
Japan
-
Nepal
-
Laos
-
Brazil
-
Bolivia
-
Chile
-
Portugal
-
Australia
-
Jamaica
-
Panama
-
Nicaragua
-
Haiti,
...among other
countries.
If they had known, taxpayers might also object to the CIA's
numerous overthrows of foreign governments by force and violence - such as
was done in Iran in 1953 by President Eisenhower and Chile in 1973 by
President Nixon.
Both overthrows precipitated bloodbaths that cost tens of thousands of
innocent civilians lives. Blum also lists the countries the CIA has
attempted to overthrow or has actually overthrown.
His list includes,
-
Greece
-
The Philippines
-
East Germany
-
Iran
-
Guatemala
-
Indonesia
-
Iraq
-
Viet Nam
-
Laos
-
Ecuador
-
The Congo
-
France
-
Cuba
-
Ghana
-
Chile
-
South Africa
-
Bolivia
-
Portugal
-
Nicaragua,
...to cite a few.
As I write, today, October 11,
2010, Nobel Peace Prize winner
Adolfo Perez Esquivel of Argentina called on
President
Obama to revise U.S. (imperialist) policies toward Latin America.
He questioned why the U.S. continues to plant its military bases across the
region.
That's an excellent question. If the U.S. is a peace-loving nation, why does
it need 800 bases the world over in addition to 1,000 on its own soil?
Americans might recoil in disgust if they knew of the CIA's numerous
assassinations of the elected officials of other nations.
Is it any wonder
Americans so often ask the question,
"Why do they hate us?"
As historian
Arnold Toynbee wrote in 1961,
"America is today the leader of a world-wide
anti-revolutionary movement in the defense of vested interests. She now
stands for what Rome stood for.
Rome consistently supported the rich against
the poor in all foreign communities that fell under her sway; and, since the
poor, so far, have always and everywhere been more numerous than the rich,
Rome's policy made for inequality, for injustice, and for the least
happiness of the greatest number."
The CIA's protective secrecy resembles nothing so much as the KKK, which
proudly proclaimed itself "the Invisible Empire" and whose thugs killed
citizens having the courage to identify hooded Klansmen to law enforcement
officials.
Today, it is our highest public officials that protect this
criminal force, said to number about 25,000 employees.
It is actually a
Federal offense to reveal the identity of a CIA undercover agent - unless,
of course, you happen to be I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, and are employed by
Vice President Dick Cheney.
Libby leaked the identity of CIA agent
Valerie Plame to punish her husband Joseph Wilson for publishing a report that
undercut the White House lie that Saddam Hussein had purchased "yellowcake"
from Niger to fuel WMD.
Today, high public officials direct the CIA's
criminal policies and protect its agents' identities the better to enable
them to commit their crimes.
According to journalist Fred Cook in his book "Ku
Klux Klan - America's Recurring Nightmare",
"The Klan was inherently a vigilante
organization. It could commit the most atrocious acts under the guise of
high principle and perpetrators of those acts would be hidden behind white
masks and protected by Klan secrecy... (The Klan) set itself up as judge,
jury and executioner" - a policy adopted by the CIA today.
CIA spies have conducted their criminal operations masquerading as
officials
of U.S. aid programs, business executives, or journalists.
Example:
The San
Diego-based Copley News Service's staff of foreign correspondents allegedly
was created to provide cover to CIA spies, compromising legitimate American
journalists trying to do their jobs. While the murders committed by the KKK
likely ran into the many thousands, the CIA has killed on a far grander
scale and managed to keep its role largely secret.
As Tim Weiner, who covered the CIA for the New York Times noted in his book
"Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA":
"In Guatemala, 200,000
civilians had died during forty years of struggle following the agency's (CIA)
1954 coup against an elected president."
Weiner adds,
"the CIA's officers in
Guatemala still went to great lengths to conceal the nature of their close
relations with the military and to suppress reports that Guatemalan officers
on its payroll were murderers, torturers, and thieves."
When it comes to
murder, the CIA makes the KKK look like Boy Scouts.
Like the KKK, CIA terrorists operate above the law. KKK members committed
thousands of lynching yet rarely were its members punished for them. In
2009 at a speech at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, President Obama
revealed he was not intent on punishing CIA agents for their crimes but
would rather "look forward."
This seemingly charitable philosophy may be
driven by the fact that Obama worked for Business International Corporation,
a CIA front, at least in 1983 and perhaps longer, and allegedly is the son
of a mother and father both of whom also worked for the CIA, as did Obama's
grandmother!
I could find none of this in Obama's biography when he ran for
the presidency, when a gullible American public elected a CIA "mole" to the
White House.
Consider this, too:
an agency President Truman feared would become "an
American Gestapo" when he signed the enabling legislation into law in 1947
has become just that, and it casts a lengthy shadow over the White House.
Ominously, it has in Barack Obama one of its own former employees sitting in
the Oval Office - a man who, according to news reports, has vastly expanded
the frequency of the CIA's assassinations by drone aircraft in Pakistan and
who illegally claims the "right" to assassinate any American citizen abroad
as well.
What's more, from 1989 to 1993
George Bush Sr., the CIA's own
former Director, sat in the White House.
Additionally, from 2001 to 2009, the CIA had that Director's son,
George W.
Bush, in the Oval Office giving the CIA a blank check after
the 9/11
massacre.
Bush Jr., according to The New York Times, in the summer of 1974
worked for Alaska International Industries, which did contract work for the
CIA. The Times noted that this job did not appear in his biography when he
ran for the White House in 2000, terming it "The Missing Chapter in the Bush
Bio."
Thus, two presidential candidates with CIA ties
- Bush Jr. and Obama - both
neglected to mention them. And in Bill Clinton, who presided from 1993 to
2001, the CIA had a go-along president who satisfied the Agency's blood-lust
when he authorized the first illegal "rendition," a euphemism for what KKK
thugs once knew as kidnapping and torture.
Is there any question that the
Agency has not played an influential, behind-the-scenes or even a direct
role in the operations of the U.S. government at its highest level?
It may
indeed be a stretch to argue that the CIA is running the country but it is
no stretch to say that year after year our presidents reflect the criminal
philosophy of the Agency.
Other parallels with the KKK are striking.
As Richmond Flowers, the Attorney
General of Alabama stated in 1966,
"I've found the Klan more than just
another secret society... It resembles a shadow government, making its own
laws, manipulating local politics, burrowing into some of our local
law-enforcement agencies... When a pitiable misfit puts on his $15 sheet,
society can no longer ignore him."
Yet the descendants of those misfits have
moved up today where they feel comfortable as operatives in the shadow
government run by the White House.
One of the CIA's illicit duties has been
to serve as a conduit for funneling U.S. taxpayer dollars to corrupt
dictators and strongmen bent on suppressing the popular will of their
citizenry.
As Noam Chomsky wrote in "Failed States", in
Honduras,
"military officers in charge of the battalion (3-16) were on the
CIA payroll."
This elite unit, he says,
"organized and trained by the United
States and Argentine neo-Nazis," was "the most barbaric of the Latin
American killers that Washington had been supporting."
Like the KKK, the CIA kidnaps many of its victims with no thought ever of
legal procedure. It exhibits utter disdain for the rights of those
individuals, the sovereignty of foreign nations, or respect for
international law.
At least hundreds of foreigners, mostly from the Middle
East, have been the victims of "renditions" just as the KKK kidnapped and
flogged and lynched blacks, labor leaders, Catholics, Jews, or wayward wives
whom it felt to be morally lacking. In September, 1921, The New York World
ran a series exposing the KKK. It pointed out that, among other things, the
KKK was violating the Bill of Rights wholesale.
This included the Fourth
amendment against "unreasonable searches and seizures," the Fifth and the
Sixth amendments, guaranteeing that no one may be held without a grand jury
indictment or punished without a fair trial. And these rights today are
similarly trampled by the CIA against American citizens, not just
foreigners.
Apparently, only foreign courts care to rein in the CIA. The 23 CIA agents
that it took to render one "suspect" in Italy are wanted there by the
magistrates. (The spooks, by the way, ran up some fabulous bills in luxury
hotels on taxpayers' dollars in that escapade.)
Former President Jimmy
Carter wrote in his book "Our Endangered Values", the CIA
transferred some of those it kidnapped to countries that included Egypt,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, Morocco, Jordan, and Uzbekistan where,
"the techniques
of torture are almost indescribably terrible, including, as a U.S.
ambassador to one of the recipient countries reported, 'partial boiling of a
hand or an arm,' with at least two prisoners boiled to death."
The KKK's
methods of punishment were often as ugly: the brutal flogging of blacks in
front of vicious crowds, followed by castration and burning their victims
alive, and then lynching of the corpses.
As for the CIA, "Why?" asks
investigative reporter William Blum,
"are these men rendered in the first
place if not to be tortured? Does the United States not have any speakers in
foreign languages to conduct interrogations?"
That the CIA is a terrorist organization was upheld in the famous "CIA On
Trial" case in Northampton, Mass., in 1987, when a jury acquitted 14
protestors who tried to stop CIA recruitment on campus, according to Francis
Boyle, the University of Illinois international law authority who defended
the group.
The defense charged the CIA was,
"an organized criminal conspiracy
like the SS and the Gestapo."
Boyle said,
"You would not let the SS or the
Gestapo recruit on campus at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, so
you would not permit the CIA to recruit on campus either."
Another shared characteristic of the KKK and CIA is greed, the desire to
loot the hard-earned wealth of others.
Often, Klansmen terrorized
African-Americans who had amassed property to frighten them off their land.
Law-abiding black citizens who had pulled themselves up by the proverbial
bootstraps were cheated out of their homes and acreage by the night riders.
Similarly, the CIA across Latin America has aligned itself with the
well-to-do ruling class at every opportunity. It has cooperated with the
elite to punish and murder labor leaders and clergy who espoused economic
opportunity for the poor. The notion that allowing the poor to enrich
themselves fairly will also create more wealth for an entire society
generally, including the rich, has not permeated CIA thinking.
I emphasize
what historian Toynbee noted:
"America is today the leader of a world-wide
anti-revolutionary movement in the defense of vested interests. She now
stands for what Rome stood for."
In sum, by adopting the terrorist philosophy of the KKK and elevating it to
the operations of government at the highest level, the imperial
Obama
administration, like its predecessors, is showing the world the worst
possible face of America.
Foreigners do not see the goodness inherent in the
American people - most of whom only want a good day's pay for a good day's
work and to educate their children and live at peace with the world. Every
adult American has a solemn obligation to demand that its government live up
to international law, punish the CIA criminals in its midst, and become a
respected citizen of the world.
This will not come to pass until Congress
abolishes the CIA, putting an end to its KKK-style terrorism which threatens
Americans as well as humankind everywhere.
