WikiLeaks Website
In Internet history, 1994-2004 was the era of the pioneers.
2004-2007 was the era of the merchants. Now
were entering the era of the bullies. Everywhere in the world, sites are
going dark, arrests are increasing, more people are going to prison. The Web
just celebrated its 20th birthday. Nobody used to take it seriously, but
those days are gone.
Nacer (all first names of Internet users in this article have been changed)
remembers the first computer with Internet access in the national library of
Damas, in Syria. A guard who didnt speak a word of English came and sat
next to you while you were at the computer, to keep an eye on this
unfamiliar volatile. Those were the good old days. Today, in the comfort of
their homes, Syrians surf a censored Web.
However, cybercensorship, and
collecting data about Internet users, are not practices limited to
dictatorships.
Italy is right up there with Beijing and Shanghai, where cybercafés are
required by law to check the IDs of every single client. In Kazakhstan at
the moment, people are strongly advised not to publish the words economic
crisis online. The president doesnt want them to. This is quaint compared
to the tests going on in Australia to purge the domestic Web of
pedo-pornographic content.
All governments are anxious about the Hydra
that is the Internet, but they all act on their concerns according to their
culture. Great Britain is preparing to monitor and archive all electronic
communications in the name of the
War on Terror. In France, the battle
between the government and Internet users is over the downloading of
copyrighted material.
When the dust settles on the legal battlefields, there
remains an unequal power relationship: governments and Internet service
providers (ISP) now have the technological means to detect and block access
to sites they find objectionable on a countrywide scale.
When this happens,
its called Web filtering.
ERROR 404 - PAGE NOT FOUND
Web filtering is most often indicated by the Page Not Found message
familiar to all Internet users, free or monitored. In computer lingo, its
called a 404 error.
The 404 page has always been a problem. According to a
charming tech legend, in the early days of the Web, at CERN in Switzerland,
researchers who were sick of continually having to restart a failing server
located in office number 404 named the failure-to-connect error after this
unlucky office.
Whether the story is true or not, this error page really
does have bad karma.
In Oman, in Bahrain, in Dubai, the 404 page works overtime:
you are
redirected to a message informing you, in English and Arabic, that the site
you are looking for is not authorized in the kingdom.
In China, the 404 page
doesnt come with an explanation. Theres no point; the sites are censored.
American soldiers in Iraq see it when they try to access YouTube while on
base, which is prohibited by the US Army. They dont have that problem in
cybercafés in Baghdad.
In Algeria and Egypt, it indicates an actual
technical problem. The Web isnt filtered there, though it is closely
monitored. You get it in Syria if you try to go to a site that ends in .il,
the top-level domain for Israel. But youll have no trouble getting to a
porn site. And in Tunisia, the 404 page is just fake. Youll get an Internet
Explorer or Firefox page informing you that your connection failed.
The only
problem is that the Firefox logo displayed when youre using Internet
Explorer (or vice versa) makes it clear that youve landed on a phony page.
In Tunisia, this gave birth to the expression a 404 bâchee
(canvas-covered) for the censored pages, a reference to the little
canvas-back Peugeot pickup truck so popular in Africa.
Tunisian Internet
users exclaim in unison, And the drivers name is Ammar! Ammar, for the
first letter of the ATI (Tunisian Internet Agency), an arm of the Tunisian
Ministry of the Interior.
FIRST STOP, TUNISIA
On our cruise through Censorland, we must stop over in Tunisia, the first
African country to have access to the Internet, that shining gateway to a
computerized citizenry and new technologies.
Praised by
Bill Gates (I am
amazed by Tunisia), this country is at the forefront of cybercensorship.
Back in 2000, when the blogosphere was still deserted, the country led the
charge by censoring the forum Takriz.org (fed up.org) within its borders.
That same year, its first cyber-dissident, Zouhair Yahyaoui, was arrested in
a cybercafé and condemned to 18 months in prison for having published on his
site, Tunezine, a survey that asked,
Is Tunisia a kingdom, a republic, a
zoo, a prison?
The 10-year marriage of the latest cyber-surveillance technologies and a
police state has declined into a sad routine - imprisonment of
cyber-dissidents and automatic suppression of foreign press sites if even a
paragraph is deemed undesirable.
Lofti, a Tunisian who lives in Europe,
recalls that he was never able to connect to the site Voila.fr when he was
in the country. Why? Because of the AFP dispatches published on the portal?
Photos that were too sexy? Asking questions is also frowned upon.
Interestingly, the ATI has always, from the beginning, been run by a woman.

Khadija Ghariani, an engineer, Ecole nationale supérieure des
telecommunications, Paris, class of 84
-
Feriel Béji, who has a doctorate in
artificial intelligence
-
Lamia Cheffai Sghaier, an electrical engineer,
each took turns running the agency
Among dissidents, theyre called Ben
Alis Angels, a local show with the tagline,
Were here to make you hate
the Internet!
Tunisia is also a master of cyber-humor.
WRITE JI/AN/G ZE/MIN
The other old soldier of cybercensorship is China.
Everyone knows that a
Great Firewall shields the eyes of the Chinese from millions of sites.
Accessing Web content freely is just not an option, but the Chinese dont
complain much; theyre used to it. Writing and conversing online is what
they love to do. Its harmonization that aggravates them.
Ever since the Communist Party in China decided to construct a harmonious
society in 2007, the Web is not only censored there, its harmonized. An
automatic filter, an invisible hand, suppresses a word here, a name there,
any phrases, comments, blogs, or images that are undesirable.
So they say,
Ive been harmonized.
A little lesson learned by e-mail from Edwin, an
English-Chinese interpreter who has lived in Wenzhou for a long time:
Take,
for example, the name of the former president Jiang Zemin, the one of
Tiananmen fame, which has been meticulously erased from the Chinese Web.
If
you write it on a blog or a forum, sometimes its automatically replaced by
stars or a blank space, or it could be that you wont even be able to send
the message. It might also be removed after publication. But you just have
to be a little creative.
Write Ji/an/g Ze/min and youre good to go.
The censorship robots dont understand words with slashes, paraphrases, or
the double phonetic meaning of a Chinese character.
What are the notorious
forbidden words that they track? No one knows but the Party, which chooses
them, and the ISPs, which do housework. Occasionally, a pirated list of
prohibited words shows up on the Web.
The latest one contained 1,041 words (chinadigitaltimes.net/tag/banned-words).
These included sex, Tibet, Falun Gong (a forbidden religious movement),
Tiananmen, play-boy, fuck, multiple parties, Taiwan independence, police,
whore, corruption, torture, public funds, anus, Jesus Christ, riot,
insurrection, air disaster, 89, tyranny, North Korea, scrotum, dictatorship,
pigeon, timeshare, penitentiary, Voice of America, bra, Geneva finance,
shit.
Even China is starting to have trouble managing its 300 million restless
Internet users - the population of the United States - and the flood of
their insolent comments, which disturb the general harmony.
Why else would
they have hired the 50 Cent Gang to harmonize opinions on the Web? This
mysterious group was so named because it is made up of innumerable anonymous
workers who are said to be paid a half Yuan (0.05 , the price of a subway
ticket) for every pro-government comment left on forums, chat rooms, and blogs.
Our man in Wenzhou confirms this by e-mail:
Its pretty easy to spot
them. When someone publishes 50 messages in the afternoon of the same day he
created a profile, we assume its one of them.
Some of these part-timers
who lack imagination even give blatant clues, choosing obvious usernames
like Morning Harmony and Harmony of the Geranium.
THE MYANMAR JUNTA OPTION
Not all countries have the conviction, or the inexhaustible labor pool that
the Chinese censorship industry has.
But there is nonetheless a wide variety
of techniques to choose from. Computer complexities aside, the Web can be
compared to a telephone exchange. To censor it, the easiest thing to do is
still to simply pull out the plug connecting the domestic Web to
international traffic. This is the Myanmar Junta Option, used during the
demonstrations in 2007.
Another method is to throttle the connection speed of individual users. In
Iran, President Ahmadinejad has a blog, but only the government and the
clergy have high-speed Internet access. The average Iranian has to make do
with 256k/second, which makes it unlikely that hell be downloading racy
films or speeches glorifying atheism, which he couldnt find anyway. (Just
for comparison, a basic ADSL connection in France is 10 times faster.)
Censors can also choose to place the clamp where their domestic Web meets
the Worldwide Web, as they do in Saudi Arabia, in order to sift the vice
from the virtue at their convenience before allowing content through. Among
the techniques considered outdated today is DNS poisoning, which is
practiced in Thailand.
That explains why, in Bangkok, you can pull up a BBC
article online and find yourself on the home page of a local government
office.
But for your more modern censors, with money to invest, those days are over.
Censorship is selective and flexible, recognizing and suppressing sites or
domains with the help of robots that seek out keywords or entire categories
of sites. To do this, of course, you need specialized software. Tools that
behave like parental control software raised to the millionth power, and
produce the same result.
And most of these are manufactured in Western
countries.
FILTERS MADE IN USA
In the United States, three serious companies are on the rise, with steadily
increasing sales:
-
Secure Computing
-
Websense
-
Blue Coat
Their specialty
is the security of business networks and intranets.
According to the
OpenNet
Initiative, a collaborative research project among Harvard, Toronto,
Cambridge, and Oxford Universities that studies cybercensorship, these are
the three main providers of filtering tools to governments.
Theres nothing illegal about selling computer security tools.
The product
page of SmartFilter, the leading software product, says,
SmartFilter removes
all inappropriate content from the workplace and educational environment,
limits your liability, manages bandwidth, and ensures protection against
security risks.
Its thanks to them that office workers cant go to Facebook at work, and that gaming, gambling and pornographic sites cant be
accessed by computers in libraries and schools.
But selling these tools to
governments of countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia, which we know arent
too concerned about human rights? Secure Computing has always denied these
contracts, even going so far as to accuse Iran of illegally acquiring
their software.
Helmi Noman, a Harvard researcher in charge of the Middle East for the
OpenNet Initiative, consistently sees the signs of these filtering
specialists during the tests that the organization conducts regularly in all
the countries of the world. And if theyre not the culprits, their partners
are.
These tools are also distributed by the biggest names in the computer
industry:
-
Microsoft
-
Sun
-
Cisco
-
McAfee
-
Dell
Evidently the Emirate of
Bahrain has recently done some shopping.
IN BAHRAIN, ONE SIMPLE RULE -
WE DONT TALK ABOUT THE EMIR
In this little Gulf country, described by expatriates as pretty cool, the
rule was short and simple: dont talk about the Emir.
Since January, Bahrain
has switched into high gear. Ahmed is a software engineer in Manama, the
capital. Hes lived through old-school censorship and the new kind too. He
likes taking risks; one of his pastimes for the last 10 years has been
publishing a blog on local news, which regularly causes problems for him.
The worst, in 2005, ended in 15 days of jail time because he published a
photo of the Emirs son drinking champagne at the finish line of a Formula 1
race. At times, his blog has been crudely censored, in a way that was easy
to get around. Since January, and a decree promising to remove from the Web
elements that are contrary to the culture (pornography, anti-religious
material), the Web throughout the entire kingdom has been paralyzed.
According to Ahmed, up to 40% of sites are inaccessible in Bahrain,
including advertising, cooking blogs, Google Translate, and technical
engineering sites. Its reached the point where foreign companies are
complaining because they cant work.
What happened? Its a classic scenario, one that Helmi Noman has often seen
when a government decides to use these tools.
Overwhelmed by the power of
the filtering software that the government has bought and imposed on them,
the ISPs make one mistake after another. However, when it comes to one
category of sites in Bahrain, there is no question of an accident on the
part of the ISPs or the palace technicians.
Ever since January, all Shiite
sites and blogs, though hardly pornographic, have disappeared from the Sunni
kingdom. Ahmed is a Shiite. He still writes on his blog occasionally, for
his foreign readers, and wonders if hell be allowed to leave the country
the next time he goes to the airport.
From Doha, in Qatar, where hes giving a lecture, Helmi Noman warns about
these false-bottomed filtering tools.
Western societies are selling ISPs
not only filtering software, but also decisions about freedom of
expression.
The censorship package includes the software plus a database of
20 million sites and updates that can be regularly downloaded, as with
antivirus software. SmartFilter places these sites in 91 categories.
Its up
to the client to choose the categories he wants to prohibit.
When an ISP
buys SmartFilter, he is buying 20 million decisions and 91 categories that
could be wrong.
These mistakes are fairly common, according to what Helmi Noman has found.
On the day that sites as varied as Orkut (a social network very popular in
India and Brazil), Last.fm (online music), LiveJournal (the most popular
blog platform in the former Soviet Union), and Twitter (microblogging) were
labeled dating sites - for what reason we dont know - it was temporarily
impossible to access them from different parts of the globe.
In April, 2007,
the video site Dailymotion spent several days in Category V4 (pornography).
Internet users in Oman, Yemen and Tunisia were the ones who felt that: no
Dailymotion for them. The database that feeds the filters can be accessed
online (www.trustedsource.org/urlcheck).
Its collaborative. Anyone - a
company, an individual, or the league of virtue of any religion - can flag a
site and label it according to his own beliefs, from anywhere in the world,
anonymously.
Secure Computing isnt feeling the recession. It was just bought by the
antivirus giant, McAfee, for 465 million dollars (around 350 million Euros).
The new management is noncommittal in its response to any question about
government cyber-surveillance:
The governments that are our clients can use
all of the categories [which we provide] to shape the Internet to suit their
cultural needs. McAfee has no control over, or any say in the way an
organization implements its own filtering strategy.
To be fair, Europe is
doing its share too. Siemens offers a catalog of solutions for intercepting
and monitoring communications.
China is one of their biggest clients.
TALKING BACK WITH TECHNOLOGY
Nobody wants a Web crawling with pedophiles, terrorists and criminals.
But
the perfectly democratic example of Australia and its costly offensive
against online pedophilia (budget: 125 million Australian dollars over four
years, about 70 million Euros) got off to an appallingly amateurish start.
In March, during the filtering tests, the ultra-secret blacklist of 2,395
blocked pedophile sites was leaked and ended up on the site for such
slip-ups,
WikiLeaks. Fortunately.
The leak revealed that only half of the
sites fell into that category. Some unfortunate errors: the sites of a
dentists office, a dog boarding facility, and a travel agency were also on
the list.
To create its blacklist, the Australian government - like others - relied on
information from the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a British organization
based in Cambridge that has been cataloging sites flagged as pedophile since
1995. The IWF is one of 20 such organizations around the world, subsidized
mainly by players in the Internet sector. Little by little, without any
oversight, or anything to recommend it but its good intentions, it has
become the pedophilia police for the authorities.
In December, an IWF flag
resulted in the censorship in Great Britain of the Wikipedia page for Virgin
Killer, an album by the German hard rock group, Scorpions. The cover of this
old album, which was never the object of any legal action, shows a nude
teenage girl.
The Web has no central government, no universal law, no Red Cross, no seat
at the UN. Every Internet user must deal with the legal whims of his country
on his own. In case of trouble, he might have recourse to a few
organizations that defend freedom of expression. A worthy cause, but a
luxury in time of recession.
Once again, the response comes in the form of
technology, and its Internet users the world over who come to the rescue.
In Iran, photographer Hamed Saber developed, by himself, a little tool that
bypasses the block on the photo site Flickr, which he then made available to
the community.
The
Berkman Center at Harvard just launched
Herdict.org, a
site where anyone can flag a site that is inaccessible from a given country,
so that they will have real-time data on the Webs blind spots.
HUMOR AS A WEAPON
Because they are tech savvy, Edwin in China and Ahmed in the Emirates can
read and write whatever they want to, while remaining under the censors
radar.
They use proxy anonymizers, the unattractive name for encryption
tools that allow you to discreetly borrow the address of a computer
somewhere else in the world just long enough to launch yourself onto the
open seas of the uncensored Web.
They are called,
...and they can all be downloaded.
One of the most popular and activist of these is TOR. In 2001, the US Navy
released one of its tools for encrypting communications to the public
domain. Robert Dingledine, then a student at MIT, has the long hair and
little round glasses of freeware activists. It was he who decided to adapt
the tool to the Web and distribute it for free.
TOR, managed in the United
States by a nonprofit organization, has been downloaded millions of times.
We dont know where theyre downloading from, we dont keep any data. But
we estimate that at any given moment of the day, around the world, between
300,000 and half a million people use one of our connection addresses and
encryption to remain anonymous.
Encrypting communications on the Web is not
illegal anywhere. But the sites where you can download the anonymizers are
often prohibited.
In Thailand, using a proxy can land you in prison. The software gets around
nonetheless, on USB keys or disks, competing these days with virtual private
networks (VPN), encrypted gateways that are used, for example, by
multinationals for secure online communication with their foreign branches.
The solution is so simple that Edwin, in Wenzhou concludes,
If we really
wanted to fight cybercensorship, all wed have to do is invest a few million
dollars in a massive VPN and distribute the links and keywords for free to
Internet users. End of story.
A Thai organization, Freedom Against Censorship (FACT), is already doing
that on a small scale, to give Thai Internet users a breath of fresh air.
Fifty-thousand sites were shut down during the countrys various political
upheavals, thanks to a legislative Trojan horse: the crime of lèse majesté
(offense) against King Bhumibol. This misdeed is no joke (three to 15 years
of prison) and foreigners can also be prosecuted for it. An Australian
writer and a BBC journalist have had a taste of Thai prisons in the kings
name.
The free Web has many enemies, but new legions of allies are rising, and
giving ministries of information pause. They are the young people, for whom
life without YouTube or Facebook is inconceivable. The Web 2.0, that of
social networks and photo, video and music sharing, is continually tripping
up the censors, whose blunders are much too visible and very unpopular.
On
these gargantuan sites, where millions of people, files and links are
interconnected, its not easy to isolate a single video, or profile, or
conversation. Had the Turkish government been able to, it would have blocked
only one video that was insulting to the national icon, Ataturk, rather
than the entire YouTube site, and thus spared itself the wrath of the under
30s.
In Tunis, when Facebook was completely blocked in September of 2008, it
roused the population for the first time. It was unheard of; even the press
talked about it.
The last weapon in the Internet users arsenal is humor, and it can be
devastating. Ridicule always kills a policys credibility. In China, since
February, a tough antivulgarity campaign for a Web without crude language
or photos forced ISPs to ask public forgiveness for the indecent content
they had provided and to sanitize thousands of sites and social networks.
It took only a few days to prepare a response. It came in the form of a
little online video of a fluffy alpaca, with an exuberant childrens chorus
singing about the wonders of a mythical Chinese animal, the Grass Mud
Horse (below video).
In Chinese, alpaca
also means, almost to the tone, screw your mother.
So does grass mud
horse. He Xie (harmony, and therefore censorship) is phonetically very
close to river crab.
Here is the alpaca song:
The grass mud horse (screw
your mother) lives in the Ma Le desert (your mothers twat). This creature
fights the river crabs (harmony/censorship) in order to save the
prairies (homonym of freedom of expression).
It was a very crude and
joyful protest. But since then, harmony reigns once more, over the living as
well as the dead.
Any reference to the children who died in the Sichuan
earthquake last year is immediately harmonized.
