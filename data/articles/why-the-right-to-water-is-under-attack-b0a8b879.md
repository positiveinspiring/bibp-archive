Last week, even as the world celebrated
World
Water Day, some countries at the United Nations were trying to remove the
reference to the right to water from a document that will guide the
international development path in the coming decade.
It was less than two years ago, in the summer of 2010, that the United
Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted
a resolution recognizing water as a
human right.
This was followed by the United Nations Human
Rights Council (UNHRC) adopting a resolution on,
human rights and access to safe drinking
water and sanitation, which made these rights legally binding.
The recognition of the right to water at these
United
Nations bodies, and the developments since, such as the appointment of a
Special Rapporteur on right to water and
the resolution by the World Health
Assembly recognizing right to water, have helped place water rights on the
global agenda.
These successes were partly the result of collective efforts of water
justice activists over the last 10 years. IATP's own advocacy on right to
water was a direct response to the reference to water as a need [instead
of a right], in the Ministerial Declaration of the 2nd World Water Forum in
2000.
But these efforts have been met with consistent pushback. The efforts to
undermine the recognition of the right to water have been most visible at
the triennial World Water Forum.
Starting with the second World Water Forum
in 2000, it has steadfastly refused to recognize the right to water.
This was
the case at,
-
the third World Water Forum
in 2003 (which followed the U.N. General Comment in 2002 on right to water)
-
the fourth World Water Forum in 2006 (where several governments led by
Bolivia asked that the Ministerial recognize water as a human right)
-
the fifth World Water Forum in 2009 (to which the UNGA
president sent a letter affirming the need to recognize water as a
human right, and at which 24 governments came out with
counter-declaration recognizing water as a human right)
And yet again, in the lead up to the sixth World Water Forum earlier this
month (March 12-17, 2012), the draft ministerial declaration did not clearly
affirm the right to water despite the fact that it has now been recognized
by both by the U.N. General Assembly and by the U.N. Human Rights
Commission.
Expressing her surprise, the Special Rapporteur
on right to water
warned that,
the outcome of the World Water Forum may
result in solutions built on faulty foundations.
This is surely a pointed reference to the slogan
of the sixth forum that "Its time for solutions and commitments.
Instead of unequivocally reaffirming the,
the human right to safe drinking water and
sanitation, and explicitly committing to the full implementation of the
same, the draft ministerial declaration only committed to accelerate the
full implementation of human right obligations relating to access to
safe drinking water and sanitation.
The issue of whether access to safe drinking
water and sanitation is a human right was left open for interpretation.
To many groups in civil society it was clear that the draft Ministerial
Declaration fell short of commitments that virtually all UN Member States
had already made in multiple forum.
Over 40 international and national networks and
organizations issued
a joint call to the 6th World Water Forum
asking that,
human right obligations relating to access
to safe drinking water and sanitation be replaced by the human right
to safe drinking water and sanitation, or failing that they abstain
from endorsing the declaration.
Unfortunately the Ministerial Declaration of the
World Water Forum that came out on March 13 neither took account of these
suggestions nor paid attention to the
warning by civil society groups that,
a Ministerial Declaration containing
retrogressive language on the right to safe drinking water and
sanitation would still set a negative precedent, which a small number of
States will use to try to undermine progress on the right to safe
drinking water and sanitation at the United Nations level and in other
international processes.
While the Ministerial Declaration of the 6th
World Water Forum is neither legally binding, nor does it carry the
political and moral authority of a UN resolution adopted in accordance with
UN rules and procedures, it appears that the warning by civil society was
spot on.
This week in New York a handful of governments
have been trying to remove the reference to right to water from the draft
outcome statement being prepared for Rio+20, the 20th anniversary of the
first earth summit held in Rio in 1992. The current draft was formulated on
the basis of extensive consultation with governments, private sector and
civil society.
Despite many shortcomings this draft outcome
document affirms a rights based approach to sustainable development and
clearly refers to the right to water.
What is at stake in
keeping this reaffirmation of the right to water?
To begin with, this language weakens the clear affirmation that governments
need to determine how to realize the right to water and leaves room open for
States to individually determine whether their human rights obligations
require them to realize the right to water and sanitation for all.
The right to water is also recognized as a useful tool by communities who
are hurt by developments that reduce their access to safe water.
A clear
affirmation of these legally binding rights (as per HRC resolution and/or
national constitutions) in national and international rules, regulations and
policy documents become extremely important for pursuit of decisions that
are advantageous to vulnerable communities.
An important corollary to the recognition of this right is the attention it
draws to the large number of people for whom these rights are not a reality
yet. A case in point is the way the Special Rapporteur on right to water has
been able to highlight violations of right to water in countries she visits.
Finally, as I have
said elsewhere, globally there is an increasing attempt
to promote policies that will treat water primarily as an economic good at
the cost of water as a fundamental right.
Several Rio+20 initiatives on the green economy
also follow an approach that narrowly focuses on resource use efficiency and
economic growth.
In the absence of effective regulatory frameworks,
safeguards and the clear recognition of water as a fundamental human right,
corporate interests will continue to supersede marginalized, low-income
communities and smallholder farmers.
The stakes of reaffirming right to water is
especially high as we move towards Rio+20.
