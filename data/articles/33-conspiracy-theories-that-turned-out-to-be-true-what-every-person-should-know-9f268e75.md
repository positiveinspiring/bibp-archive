# 33 Conspiracy Theories That Turned Out To Be True - What Every Person 
Should Know...

1. The Dreyfus Affair
In the late 1800s in France, Jewish artillery officer
Alfred Dreyfus was wrongfully convicted of treason based on false government
documents, and sentenced to life in prison.
The French government did
attempt to cover this up, but Dreyfus was eventually pardoned after the
affair was made public (an act that is credited to writer Émile Zola).
2. The Mafia
This secret crime society was virtually unknown until the
1960s, when member Joe Valachi first revealed the society's secrets to law
enforcement officials. What was known was that organized crime existed, but
not that the extent of their control included working with the CIA,
politicians and the biggest businesses in the world.
Many people do not realize that
J. Edgar Hoover, the first Director of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the United States, was appointed
director of the Bureau of Investigation - predecessor to the FBI - in 1924 and
was instrumental in founding the FBI in 1935, where he remained director
until his death in 1972.
Hoover is credited with building the FBI into a
large and efficient crime-fighting agency, and with instituting a number of
modern innovations to police technology, such as a centralized fingerprint
file and forensic laboratories. For the majority of his time as FBI
Director, there were numerous Mafia shootings as a result of Prohibition.
Hoover continued to deny the very existence of organized crime. Many figures
in politics and media denied the existence of the Mafia, which had no
official title.
Gangsters like Gambino and Capone were thought of as Street
Kings only, just running local operations. It was not until the 1960's until
people began to learn that a very organized system of superiors and control
existed within the organized crime world. Arnold Rothstein, the man who
rigged the World Series, started the major drug trade and is credited as
being the "King of the Roaring 20's."
In his biography, he is said to have
brought Lucky Luciano into his business and trained him to start "The
Commission." Five families in New York would work together and pay their
dues. Throughout the entire time the media and the FBI denied the mafia
existed, in reality, not only did it exist, but it operated in multiple
territories.
Each region had a boss and underboss, with soldiers underneath
them.
Above the boss was a Don and even above a Don was more figures. As it
went up, regions got larger. It was extremely organized, down to the books.
In the 1950's, crime bosses from around the United States met to centralize
their power and organize their system. All this time, the public was told
that the organized crime world didn't exist, and that all the crimes were
committed by local gangsters...
Even with all we knew about how organized the mafia was during prohibition,
people still laugh at the idea of organized crime conspiracies taking place
in politics.
Usually the excuse people will give you is something along the
lines of,
"I just don't think people are that organized..."
Funny how easy
it must be to get away with stuff these days, no one believes its
possible....
3. MK-ULTRA
Jared Lee Loughner
If you don't know what MK Ultra is, read the 3rd paragraph.
You need to so
that you understand conspiracy theorists context in referring to Loughner,
the shooter in Arizona, as potential MK Ultra.
Well this is weird, Loughner's attorney, who defended "Unabomber"
Ted Kaczynski, also may have
represented Tim McVeigh. Tim McVeigh, a lot of people don't know, was seeing
the #2 mind sciences doctor in the country ordered by the military from his
years in Desert Storm. Some people, like Alex Jones, believe McVeigh was Mk
Ultra as well.
It appears Loughner was seen dazed, confused and smiling like
a lunatic after the shooting. Very similar to programming side affects, but
not evidence yet. One story online shows there is a 2nd man they are seeking
for arrest in the shooting, someone who was with Loughner right before the
shooting who was meeting with him. They have video of this man from
surveillance cameras near by.
I can say this with confidence, it appears there is enough evidence to start
the rumor mill over MK Ultra. I expect you will hear conspiracy theorists
discussing this shooting for a while, especially if some kind of bill, law
or anti-terror act is passed quickly as a result of the trauma and tragedy.
What is MK Ultra?
Mk Ultra was a code name declassified in the 1970's
Church Committee and
other lawsuits brought against the government where the public was informed
that thousands of people, patients from hospitals, mental health patients,
prisoners in the... justice system, and even public citizens were selected
for testing without their consent.
Testing was conducted in the 50s, 60s,
70s, 80s and 90s. Some claim they still go on today and provide evidence.
The testing includes torture, drugs and exotic hypnosis experiments in an
effort to explore the mind, propaganda and other related patterns.
One sub
department of the operation included a group of lunatic scientists who were
looking to create an assassins program, to see if it was possible to kidnap
someone, say an enemy in a country, conduct hypnosis and other techniques
learned in Mk Ultra, and send them back to the country with a plan to
assassinate their leaders.
That plan is what scares people most. MK Ultra
was carried out by the CIA illegally and in the 1970s, hundreds of patients
sued the federal government for damages, and the government settled and paid
millions of dollars.
Now here is the really trippy, scary info.
Some of these patients where MK
Ultra was used include,
-
Ted Kazinsky (the unabomber)
-
Mark David Chapman (the man who shot
Lennon)
-
Sirhan Sirhan (the man who shot Bobby Kennedy)
-
Lee Harvey Oswald is rumored to have attended a base in Japan before
heading to Russia where MK Ultra experiments were taking place
David Ferrie,
Oswald's boss for a long period of time, is said to have been an MK Ultra
specialist and specialized in hypnosis and believe it or not, sexual
molestation to mess with his patients heads. David Ferrie was a convicted
child predator who left the Catholic Church to train Black Operations hitmen
for the invasion of Cuba.
David Ferrie taught the Louisiana Civil Air
Patrol where both Lee Harvey Oswald and Barry Seal joined as 15 year old
children. Barry Seal became the primary operative in Iran-Contra who ran
drugs for the CIA and was an active contract hitman, Oswald was accused of
killing John F Kennedy.
David Ferrie was murdered, made to look like a
suicide, the night before his testimony in a trial Jim Garrison brought
against the CIA where he accused Ferrie and others of using Oswald as a
patsy...
I have tons more info on this subject matter for my film "Convenient Deaths:
History of Assassinations, Black Operations and the CIA"
George H.W. Bush was Director of the CIA during the time many of the MK Ultra
cases were brought against the government. He was a major oil tycoon and
Skull and Bones man who was active in CIA operations before that and after
his director position at the CIA was Vice President of the CIA.
H.W. Bush
later became president after previously sitting as Vice President during the
Reagan Years.
Many people have pointed out George HW Bush's connections to the Kennedy
Assassination during the years Bush Sr. was involved with CIA Operations
against Cuba while he owned Zapata Oil. Lee Harvey Oswald even attended a
social dinner with CIA operatives where Bush Sr. was present years before the
assassination, as pointed out in many books and research by investigators.
One good book that will fill you in on all this is "Family of Secrets."
A film that came out a few years ago attempted to show the connections of
Bush Sr. to Kennedy's assassination called JFK II which you can view here:
JFK II - The Bush Connection
John Hinckley, Jr. and President Reagan
In 1980, Hinckley Sr. was a Texas oilman who, the records show, strove
mightily to get fellow Texas oilman George H.W. Bush the Republican
nomination for president.
The Bushes and the Hinckleys were frequent dinner
companions. An almost bewildered John Chancellor on NBC Nightly News
reported "the bizarre coincidence" that Vice President Bush's son, Neil, and
Scott Hinckley had dinner plans for March 31, 1981 - now cancelled, of
course.
[But even Chancellor failed to mention the close friendship between
the the assassin's father and Vice President Bush - let alone the rest of the
corporate media.]
Here is the NBC Clip that I found in archives and shared with the internet a
while ago. This same clip, along with countless others, were collected for
the documentary film series,
Core of Corruption and they were also given to
Jason Bermas to appear in
Invisible Empire.
Reports indicate that
the Bush family strove mightily to keep this
information from the American people. And some reports list this incredible
"coincidence" - directly linked to the assassination attempt of President
Reagan - as one of the most spiked stories of the last century.
In other words, the brother of the shooter and the son of the vice-president
(and their wives) had a dinner date for the day after the shooting. But it
really wasnt such "a bizarre coincidence." Those two families were very
close; but the press never focused on that critical fact as it should have.
If Reagan had died, the oilmens interests would have been served.
The weirdest part about it was that Hinkley was able to make and receive
phone calls from his hotel room but chose to walk a great distance and wait
by a public payphone where he waited for contacts everyday, as though it was
apart of a conspiracy with co-conspirators...
A very good read on the Hinckley-Bush connections is a book that came out
about 20 years ago, entitled, "The Afternoon of March 30." It was published
as a novel in order to protect the author.
Neil Bush, a landman for Amoco Oil, told Denver reporters he had met Scott
Hinckley at a surprise party at the Bush home January 23, 1981 [Nine weeks
before Hinckley's brother John Jr. attempted to assassinate President
Reagan - which would have elevated Bush Sr. to the presidency], and
approximately three weeks after the U.S. Department of Energy had begun what
was termed a "routine audit" of the books of the Vanderbilt Energy
Corporation, the Hinckley oil company.
In an incredible coincidence, on the
morning of March 30 [the day of the Reagan assassination attempt by John
Hinckley, Jr.], three representatives of the U.S. Department of Energy told
Scott Hinckley, John Hinckley Jr.'s older brother and Vanderbilt's vice
president of operations, that auditors had uncovered evidence of pricing
violations on crude oil sold by the company from 1977 through 1980.
The
auditors announced that the federal government was considering a penalty of
two million dollars. [This, on the same day that his brother John - the
youngest son of Vice President Bush's close friend - attempted the
assassination!]
Scott Hinckley reportedly requested "several hours to come
up with an explanation" of the serious overcharges.
The meeting ended a
little more than an hour before John Hinckly Jr. shot President Reagan.
Excerpts from an interview
by Theresa
Walla
United Press International
March 9, 1985
Journalism professor Nathaniel Blumberg was so disturbed
about the investigation into the attempted assassination of President Reagan
that he turned his suspicions into a 377-page novel.
In The Afternoon of March 30 , Blumberg blends fact and fiction in looking
at the unreported "connections" between Hinckley's family and that of Vice
President George Bush, the man who came within a heartbeat of the presidency
of the United States.
"What I'm really after is the case to be officially
reopened," said the Rhodes scholar and former dean of the University of
Montana journalism school.
"If they can answer all the questions
satisfactorily, I'll be delighted," he said in an interview. "In truth, I
don't think all the questions can be answered without opening up a whole new
can of worms."
Blumberg's unease is now focused on the indifference shown to what he calls
"the story behind the story."
Bush, he said, has questions to answer in
connection with the attempt. So do the FBI and the judge who presided over
Hinckley's trial, according to Blumberg.
"I'm not saying there was a conspiracy to assassinate Reagan," Blumberg
emphasized. "I'm saying there was a conspiracy to keep significant
information from the public that it has a right to know."
Blumberg asks his readers to consider his contentions that journalists were
fed a barely believable story full of inconsistencies. A long-time media
critic, he decided the example warranted more than a critique of press
performance in a crisis. Such efforts, he said, usually "go out there and
die."
Instead, he chose to weave his questions into a novel so it would
reach a broader audience and allow him to probe problems in society and
corruption in government, as well as maladies of the U.S. press.
Here are some of the videos of the testimony from MK Ultra survivors during
court cases against the government:

Real CIA Experiments from Project MKULTRA
In the 1950s to the 1970s, the CIA mind-control project was aimed at finding
a "truth serum" to use on communist spies.
Test subjects were given LSD and
other drugs, often without consent, and some were tortured. At least one
man, civilian biochemist Frank Olson, who was working for the government,
died as a result of the experiments. The project was finally exposed after
investigations by the Rockefeller Commission.

Secrets of
The CIA...
4.
Operation Mockingbird
Also in the 1950s to '70s,
the CIA paid a number of
well-known domestic and foreign journalists (from
big-name media outlets
like Time, The Washington Post, The New York Times, CBS and others) to
publish CIA propaganda.
The CIA also reportedly funded at least one movie,
the animated "Animal Farm," by
George Orwell.
The Church Committee finally
exposed the activities in 1975.
In 1953, Joseph Alsop, then one of America's leading syndicated columnists,
went to the Philippines to cover an election.
He did not go because he was
asked to do so by his syndicate. He did not go because he was asked to do so
by the newspapers that printed his column. He went at the request of the
CIA.
Alsop is one of more than 400 American journalists who in the past 25 years
have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency
according to documents on file at CIA headquarters. Some of these
journalists' relationships with the Agency were tacit; some were explicit.
There was cooperation, accommodation and overlap.
Journalists provided a
full range of clandestine services - from simple intelligence-gathering to
serving as go-betweens with spies in Communist countries. Reporters shared
their notebooks with the CIA. Editors shared their staffs. Some of the
journalists were Pulitzer Prize winners, distinguished reporters who
considered themselves ambassadors without portfolio for their country.
Most
were less exalted: foreign correspondents who found that their association
with the Agency helped their work; stringers and freelancers who were as
interested in the derring-do of the spy business as in filing articles; and,
the smallest category, full-time CIA employees masquerading as journalists
abroad.
In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to
perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America's
leading news organizations.
The history of the CIA's involvement with the American press continues to be
shrouded by an official policy of obfuscation and deception for the
following principal reasons:
-
The use of journalists has been among the most productive means of
intelligence-gathering employed by the CIA. Although the agency has cut back
sharply on the use of reporters since 1973 (primarily as a result of
pressure from the media), some journalists are still posted abroad.
-
Further investigation into the matter, CIA officials say, would inevitably
reveal a series of embarrassing relationships in the 1950's and 1960's with
some of the most powerful organizations and individuals in American
journalism.
Among the executives who lent their cooperation to the Agency were:
-
William
Paley of the Columbia Broadcasting System
-
Henry Luce of Time Inc.
-
Arthur
Hays Sulzberger of the New York Times
-
Barry Bingham Sr. of the Louisville
Courier-Journal
-
James Copley of the Copley News Services
Other
organizations which cooperated with the CIA include:
-
the American
Broadcasting Company
-
the National Broadcasting Company
-
the Associated
Press
-
United Press International
-
Reuters
-
Hearst Newspapers
-
Scripps-Howard
-
Newsweek magazine
-
the Mutual Broadcasting System
-
the Miami
Herald
-
the old Saturday Evening Post
-
New York Herald-Tribune
By far the most valuable of these associations, according to CIA officials,
have been with,
-
the New York Times
-
CBS
-
Time Inc.
[...]
Appropriately, the CIA uses the term 'reporting' to describe much of what
cooperating journalists did for the Agency.
"We would ask them, 'Will you do
us a favor?'" said a senior CIA official.
"'We understand you're going to be
in Yugoslavia. Have they paved all the streets? Where did you see planes?
Were there any signs of military presence? How many Soviets did you see? If
you happen to meet a Soviet, get his name and spell it right... Can you set
up a meeting for us? Or arrange a message?'"
Many CIA officials regarded
these helpful journalists as operatives: the journalists tended to see
themselves as trusted friends of the Agency who performed occasional favors
- usually without pay - in the national interest.
[...]
Two of the Agency's most valuable relationships in the 1960's, according to
CIA officials, were with reporters who covered Latin America - Jerry
O'Leary of the Washington Star and Hal Hendrix of Miami News, a Pulitzer
Prize winner who became a high official of the International Telephone and
Telegraph Corporation.
Hendrix was extremely helpful to the Agency in
providing information about individuals in Miami's Cuban exile community.
[....]
A note about Hendrix - he was the one who
Seth Kantor, reporting on the JFK
assassination, was told to call for 'background' on Oswald after Oswald's
arrest.
Hendrix, from Miami, had all the info on Oswald's pro-Castro
leafleting activities in New Orleans, details about Oswald's defection to
the Soviet Union, etc.
Only years later did Kantor realize the significance of a guy like Hendrix,
CIA, having so much info on Oswald so soon after the assassination.
"The Central Intelligence Agency owns everyone of any significance in the
major media."
- William Colby, former CIA Director, quoted by Dave Mcgowan, Derailing
Democracy
"You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple
hundred dollars a month."
- CIA operative, discussing the availability and prices of journalists
willing to peddle CIA propaganda and cover stories. Katherine the Great, by

"There is quite an incredible spread of relationships. You dont need to
manipulate Time magazine, for example, because there are [Central
Intelligence] Agency people at the management level."
- William B. Bader, former CIA intelligence officer, briefing members of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, The CIA and the Media, by Carl Bernstein
"The Agency's relationship with [The New York] Times was by far its most
valuable among newspapers, according to CIA officials. [It was] general
Times policy ... to provide assistance to the CIA whenever possible."
- The CIA and the Media, by Carl Bernstein
"Senator William Proxmire has pegged the number of employees of the federal
intelligence community at 148,000 ... though Proxmire's number is itself a
conservative one. The "intelligence community" is officially defined as
including only those organizations that are members of the U.S. Intelligence
Board (USIB); a dozen other agencies, charged with both foreign and domestic
intelligence chores, are not encompassed by the term... The number of
intelligence workers employed by the federal government is not 148,000, but
some undetermined multiple of that number."
- Jim Hougan, Spooks
"For some time I have been disturbed by the way the CIA has been diverted
from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a
policy-making arm of the government.... I never had any thought that when I
set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger
operations."
- former President Harry Truman, 22 December 1963, one month after the JFK
assassination, op-ed section of the Washington Post, early edition
5. Manhattan Project
The Manhattan Project was the codename for a project
conducted during World War II to
develop the first atomic bomb.
The project
was led by the United States, and included participation from the United
Kingdom and Canada. Formally designated as the Manhattan Engineer District
(MED), it refers specifically to the period of the project from 1942-1946
under the control of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the
administration of General Leslie R. Groves.
The scientific research was
directed by American physicist 'J. Robert OppenhMafia.'
The project's roots lay
in scientists' fears since the 1930s that Nazi Germany was also
investigating nuclear weapons of its own. Born out of a small research
program in 1939, the Manhattan Project eventually employed more than 130,000
people and cost nearly US$2 billion ($22 billion in current value).
It resulted in the creation of multiple production and research sites that
operated in secret. With the total involved, this makes it one of the largest
conspiracies in history. Entire towns were built for short periods of time,
employing people, all under secrecy and top national secrecy at that.
The
government never admitted to it, the media never reported on it, and people
had no idea for over 25 years.
Project research took place at over thirty
sites across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The three
primary research and production sites of the project were the
plutonium-production facility at what is now the Hanford Site, the
uranium-enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the weapons
research and design laboratory now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory.
The MED maintained control over U.S. weapons production until the formation
of the Atomic Energy Commission in January 1947.
6. Asbestos
Between 1930 and 1960, manufacturers did all they could to
prevent the link between
asbestos and respiratory diseases, including
cancer, becoming known, so they could avoid prosecution.
American workers
had in fact sued the Johns Manville company as far back as 1932, but it was
not until 1962 that epidemiologists finally established beyond any doubt
what company bosses had known for a long time - asbestos causes cancer.
7. Watergate
Republican officials spied on the Democratic National
Headquarters from the Watergate Hotel in 1972.
While conspiracy theories
suggested underhanded dealings were taking place, it wasn't until 1974 that
White House tape recordings linked President Nixon to the break-in and
forced him to resign.
8. The Tuskegee Syphilis Study
The United States Public Health Service
carried out this
clinical study on 400 poor, African-American men with
syphilis from 1932 to 1972.
During the study the men were given false and
sometimes dangerous treatments, and adequate treatment was intentionally
withheld so the agency could learn more about the disease. While the study
was initially supposed to last just six months, it continued for 40 years.
Close to 200 of the men died from syphilis or related complications by the
end of the study.
9. Operation Northwoods
In the early 1960s, American military leaders
drafted plans to create public support for a war against Cuba, to oust Fidel
Castro from power.
The plans included committing acts of terrorism in U.S.
cities, killing innocent people and U.S. soldiers, blowing up a U.S. ship,
assassinating Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees, and hijacking
planes. The plans were all approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but were
reportedly rejected by the civilian leadership, then kept secret for nearly
40 years.
Author James Bamford, "A Pretext For War", discusses the declassified
"Operation Northwoods" documents revealing that in 1962 the CIA was planning
to stage phony terrorist attacks on the US and blame it on Cuba to start a
war:
10. 1990 Testimony of Nayirah
A 15-year-old girl named
Nayirah testified
before the U.S. Congress that she had seen Iraqi soldiers pulling Kuwaiti
babies from incubators, causing them to die.
The testimony helped gain major
public support for the 1991 Gulf War, but - despite protests that the
dispute of this story was itself a conspiracy theory - it was later
discovered that the testimony was false. The public relations firm Hill &
Knowlton, which was in the employ of Citizens for a Free Kuwait, had
arranged the testimony.
It turned out that she had taken acting lessons on
request of the CIA and was actually the niece of a major politician in
Kuwait. Nayirah was later disclosed to be Nayirah al-Sabah, daughter of Saud
bin Nasir Al-Sabah, Kuwaiti ambassador to the USA.
The Congressional Human
Rights Caucus, of which Congressman Tom Lantos was co-chairman, had been
responsible for hosting Nurse Nayirah, and thereby popularizing her
allegations.
When the girl's account was later challenged by independent
human rights monitors, Lantos replied,
"The notion that any of the witnesses
brought to the caucus through the Kuwaiti Embassy would not be credible did
not cross my mind... I have no basis for assuming that her story is not
true, but the point goes beyond that. If one hypothesizes that the woman's
story is fictitious from A to Z, that in no way diminishes the avalanche of
human rights violations."
Nevertheless, the senior Republican Mafia Human
Rights Caucus, John Edward Porter, responded to the revelations,
"by saying
that if he had known the girl was the ambassador's daughter, he would not
have allowed her to testify."
11. Counter Intelligence Programs Against Activists in the 60s
COINTELPRO (an
acronym for Counter Intelligence Program) was a series of covert, and often
illegal, projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) aimed at investigating and disrupting dissident
political organizations within the United States.
The FBI used covert
operations from its inception, however
formal COINTELPRO operations took
place between 1956 and 1971.
The FBI's stated motivation at the time was,
"protecting national security, preventing violence, and maintaining the
existing social and political order."
According to FBI records, 85% of
COINTELPRO resources were expended on infiltrating, disrupting,
marginalizing, and/or subverting groups suspected of being subversive, such
as
-
communist and socialist organizations
-
the women's rights movement
-
militant black nationalist groups, and the non-violent civil rights
movement, including individuals such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and others
associated with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
-
the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People
-
the Congress of Racial
Equality, the American Indian Movement, and other civil rights groups
-
a
broad range of organizations labeled "New Left", including Students for a
Democratic Society, the National Lawyers Guild, the Weathermen, almost all
groups protesting the Vietnam War, and even individual student demonstrators
with no group affiliation
-
nationalist groups such as those "seeking
independence for Puerto Rico."
The other 15% of COINTELPRO resources were
expended to marginalize and subvert "white hate groups," including the Ku
Klux Klan and National States' Rights Party.
The directives governing COINTELPRO were issued by FBI Director
J. Edgar Hoover, who ordered FBI
agents to "expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize"
the activities of these movements and their leaders.
This is a documentary on COINTELPRO:
Main Core is the code name of a database maintained since the 1980s by the
federal government of the United States, which contains personal and
financial data of millions of U.S. citizens believed to be threats to
national security.
The data, which comes from the NSA, FBI, CIA, and other
sources, is collected and stored without warrants or court orders.
The
database's name derives from the fact that it contains,
"copies of the 'main
core' or essence of each item of intelligence information on Americans
produced by the FBI and the other agencies of the U.S. intelligence
community."
The Main Core database is believed to have originated with the
Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 1982, following Ronald Reagan's
Continuity of Operations Plan outlined in the National Security Directive (NSD)
69/National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 55, entitled "Enduring
National Leadership," implemented on September 14, 1982.
As of 2008 there are reportedly eight million Americans listed in the
database as possible threats, often for trivial reasons, whom the government
may choose to track, question, or detain in a time of crisis.
The existence of the database was first reported on in May 2008 by
Christopher Ketcham and in July 2008 by Tim Shorrock.
Rex 84, short for Readiness Exercise 1984, is a plan by the United States
federal government to test their ability to detain large numbers of American
citizens in case of civil unrest or national emergency.
According to scholar Diana Reynolds:
The Rex-84 Alpha Explan (Readiness Exercise 1984, Exercise Plan; otherwise
known as a continuity of government plan), indicates that FEMA in
association with 34 other federal civil departments and agencies, along with
other NATO nations, conducted a civil readiness exercise during April 5-13,
1984.
It was conducted in coordination and simultaneously with a Joint
Chiefs exercise, Night Train 84, a worldwide military command post exercise
(including Continental U.S. Forces or CONUS) based on multi-emergency
scenarios operating both abroad and at home.
In the combined exercise,
Rex-84 Bravo, FEMA and DOD led the other federal agencies and departments,
including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Secret Service, the Treasury,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Veterans Administration through
a gaming exercise to test military assistance in civil defense.
The exercise anticipated civil disturbances, major demonstrations and
strikes that would affect continuity of government and/or resource
mobilization.
To fight subversive activities, there was authorization for
the military to implement government ordered movements of civilian
populations at state and regional levels, the arrest of certain unidentified
segments of the population, and the imposition of martial law.
Existence of a master military contingency plan, "Garden Plot" and a similar
earlier exercise, "Lantern Spike" were originally revealed by journalist
Ron Ridenhour, who summarized his findings in "Garden Plot and the New Action
Army."
Rex 84 was mentioned during the Iran-Contra Hearings in 1987.
The Miami
Herald wrote subsequently on July 5, 1987:
Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North and the Federal Emergency Management Agency... had drafted a contingency plan providing for the suspension of the
Constitution, the imposition of martial law, and the appointment of military
commanders to head state and local governments and to detain dissidents and
Central American refugees in the event of a national crisis.
The basic facts about Rex 84 and other contingency planning readiness
exercises - and the potential threat they pose to civil liberties if fully
implemented in a real operation - are taken seriously by scholars and civil
libertarians.
Exercises similar to Rex 84 happen regularly. Plans for roundups of large
numbers of persons in the United States in times of crisis are constructed
during periods of increased political repression such as the Palmer Raids
and the McCarthy Era.
For example, from 1967 to 1971 the FBI kept a list of over 100,000 persons
to be rounded up as subversive, dubbed the "ADEX" list. This list contained
many labor leaders, scholars, and public figures of the time.
In 2008, for the first time an active military unit has been given a
dedicated assignment stateside for civil unrest containment.
It is assigned

12. The Iran-Contra Affair
In 1985 and '86, the White House authorized
government officials to secretly trade weapons with the Israeli government
that were then secretly traded with Iran in exchange for the release of U.S.
hostages held in Iran.
The funds from the trades were then used to help
finance the illegal war in Nicaragua. The plot was uncovered by Congress in
1987. The documentary series, Core of Corruption, will be exploring details
on the Iran Contra conspiracy in greater detail. The series if 5 separate
films written and directed by Jonathan Elinoff, investigative journalist and
reporter for the New World Order Report.
During Iran Contra, drug smuggling
by the CIA was uncovered and to this day the United States population is
largely unaware of the findings of this information.
Both posts on CIA drug
running in this article of 33 conspiracies that turned out to be true are
about this very topic of drug running during Iran Contra.
13. The BCCI Scandal
The Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)
was a major international bank founded in 1972 by Agha Hasan Abedi, a
Pakistani financier.
The Bank was registered in Luxembourg. Within a decade
BCCI touched its peak, it operated in 78 countries, had over 400 branches,
and had assets in excess of US$ 20 billion making it the 7th largest private
bank in the world by assets. In the late 1980's BCCI became the target of a
two year undercover operation conducted by the US Customs Service.
This
operation concluded with a fake wedding that was attended by BCCI officers
and drug dealers from around the world who had established a personal
friendship and working relationship with undercover Special Agent Robert
Mazur. After a six month trial in Tampa, key bank officers were convicted
and received lengthy prison sentences.
Bank officers began cooperating with
law enforcement authorities and that cooperation caused BCCIs many crimes
to be revealed.
BCCI came under the scrutiny of regulatory bodies and
intelligence agencies in the 1980s due to its perceived avoidance of falling
under one regulatory banking authority, a fact that was later, after
extensive investigations, proven to be false.
BCCI became the focus of a
massive regulatory battle in 1991 and was described as a "$20-billion-plus
heist".
Investigators in the U.S. and the UK revealed that BCCI had been,
"set up deliberately to avoid centralized regulatory review, and operated
extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. Its affairs were extraordinarily
complex.
Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose
apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a
massive scale, and to avoid detection."

14. CIA Drug Running in LA
Pulitzer Prize Award winning journalist Gary Webb
exposed this alongside LAPD Narcotics Officer turned whistleblower and
author Michael Ruppert, CIA Contract Pilot Terry Reed, and many others.
In
August 1996 the San Jose Mercury News published Webb's "Dark Alliance", a
20,000 word, three-part investigative series which alleged that Nicaraguan
drug traffickers had sold and distributed crack cocaine in Los Angeles
during the 1980s, and that drug profits were used to fund the CIA-supported
Nicaraguan Contras.
Webb never asserted that the CIA directly aided drug
dealers to raise money for the Contras, but he did document that the CIA was
aware of the cocaine transactions and the large shipments of cocaine into
the U.S. by the Contra personnel.
"Dark Alliance" received national
attention. At the height of the interest, the web version of it on San Jose
Mercury News website received 1.3 million hits a day.
According to the
Columbia Journalism Review, the series became,
"the most talked-about piece
of journalism in 1996 and arguably the most famous - some would say
infamous - set of articles of the decade."

Gulf of Tonkin Never Happened
The
Gulf of Tonkin Incident is the name
given to two separate incidents involving the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
and the United States in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin.
On August 2, 1964
two American destroyers engaged three North Vietnamese torpedo boats,
resulting in the sinking of one of the torpedo boats.
This was also the
single most important reason for the escalation of the Vietnam War. After
Kennedy was assassinated, the Gulf of Tonkin gave the country the sweeping
support for aggressive military action against the North Vietnamese.
The outcome of the incident was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of
Tonkin Resolution, which granted President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority
to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be
jeopardized by "communist aggression".
In 2005, an internal National Security
Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded that USS Maddox had
engaged the North Vietnamese on August 2, but that there may not have been
any North Vietnamese vessels present during the engagement of August 4.
The
report stated,
It is not simply that there is a different story as to what
happened; it is that no attack happened that night
In truth, Hanoi's navy
was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two of the boats
damaged on August 2.In 1965, President Johnson commented privately:
"For all
I know, our Navy was shooting at whales out there."
In 1981, Captain Herrick and journalist Robert Scheer re-examined Herrick's
ship's log and determined that the first torpedo report from August 4, which
Herrick had maintained had occurred - the "apparent ambush" - was in fact unfounded.
In 1995, retired Vietnamese Defense Minister
Vo Nguyen Giap,
meeting with former Secretary of Defense McNamara, categorically denied that
Vietnamese gunboats had attacked American destroyers on August 4, while
admitting to the attack on August 2.In the Fall of 1999, retired senior CIA
engineering executive S. Eugene Poteat wrote that he was asked in early
August 1964 to determine if the radar operator's report showed a real
torpedo boat attack or an imagined one.
In October, 2005 the New York Times
reported that Robert J. Hanyok, a historian for the U.S. National Security
Agency, had concluded that the NSA deliberately distorted the intelligence
reports that it had passed on to policy-makers regarding the August 4, 1964
incident.
He concluded that the motive was not political but was probably to
cover up honest intelligence errors.

16. The Business Plot
In 1933, group of wealthy businessmen that allegedly
included the heads of Chase Bank, GM, Goodyear, Standard Oil, the
DuPont
family and Senator Prescott Bush Prescott Bush tried to recruit Marine Corps Major General
Smedley Butler to lead a military coup against President FDR and install a
fascist dictatorship in the United States.
And yes, we're talking about the
same
Prescott Bush who fathered one US President and grandfathered another one. Smedley Butler was both a patriot and a vocal FDR supporter. Apparently
none of these criminal masterminds noticed that their prospective point man
had actively stumped for FDR in 1932.Smedley spilled the beans to a
congressional committee in 1934.
Everyone he accused of being a conspirator vehemently denied it, and none of
them were brought up on criminal charges. Still, the House
McCormack-Dickstein Committee did at least acknowledge the existence of the
conspiracy, which ended up never getting past the initial planning
stages.
Though many of the people who had allegedly backed
the Business Plot
also maintained financial ties with Nazi Germany up through America's entry
into World War II. In 1934, the Business Plot was publicly revealed by
retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler testifying to the
McCormack-Dickstein Congressional Committee. In his testimony, Butler
claimed that a group of men had approached him as part of a plot to
overthrow Roosevelt in a military coup.
One of the alleged plotters, Gerald MacGuire, vehemently denied any such plot. In their final report, the
Congressional committee supported Butler's allegations of the existence of
the plot, but no prosecutions or further investigations followed, and the
matter was mostly forgotten.
On July 17, 1932, thousands of World War I veterans converged on Washington,
D.C., set up tent camps, and demanded immediate payment of bonuses due them
according to the Adjusted Service Certificate Law of 1924.
This "Bonus Army"
was led by Walter W. Waters, a former Army sergeant. The Army was encouraged
by an appearance from retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler, who
had considerable influence over the veterans, being one of the most popular
military figures of the time.
A few days after Butler's arrival, President
Herbert Hoover ordered the marchers removed, and their camps were destroyed
by US Army cavalry troops under the command of General Douglas MacArthur.
Butler, although a self-described Republican, responded by supporting
Roosevelt in that year's election.
In a 1995 History Today article Clayton
Cramer argued that the devastation of the Great Depression had caused many
Americans to question the foundations of liberal democracy.
"Many
traditionalists, here and in Europe, toyed with the ideas of Fascism and
National Socialism; many liberals dallied with Socialism and Communism."
Cramer argues that this explains why some American business leaders viewed
fascism as a viable system to both preserve their interests and end the
economic woes of the Depression.

17. July 20, 1944 Conspiracy to Assassinate Hitler
Among another 20 some odd
attempts, this one was one of the largest conspiracies involving hundreds of
loyalists in the highest echelons of Hitlers inner circle.
Near the end of
WWII, things were rapidly going south for Germany and the time seemed ripe
for guilt-ridden Nazi officers to assassinate Hitler and overthrow his
government. Colonel Henning von Tresckow recruited Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg to join the
conspiracy in 1944.The plot to take out Hitler and
then all of his loyal officers was called Operation Valkyrie.
The plan was to use the Continuity of Government Proceedings during an
assassination on Hitlers life to take over full control of the government
in Germany.
The assassination would be blamed on the Nazi SS and therefore
allow Stauffenberg to take full control of all aspects of the government. It
almost worked.
In July 1944, Stauffenberg was promoted so that he could now
start attending military strategy meetings with Hitler himself. On more than
one occasion Stauffenberg planned to kill Hitler at such a meeting with a
briefcase bomb, but he always held off because he also wanted to take out
Hitler's two right-hand men, Hermann Goering and Heinrich Himmler.
On July
20, he went for it anyway and exploded a bomb inside Hitler's conference
room with a remote detonator.
Hitler survived only minor injuries.
18.
Operation Ajax
For years, Britain had a spiffy trade deal with Iran
regarding their prodigious oil fields.
The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was
basically a giant money machine for the Anglo half, while the Iranian half
got shafted. That all changed in 1951 when Iran nationalized the AIOC and
the Iranian parliament elected Mohammed Mossadegh as Prime Minister.
Mossadegh was relatively secular, something that pissed of Iranian clerics,
but he was also very nationalistic.
He was a democratically elected, pro
American figure but the West saw his nationalizing of the oil fields a
communist move (something Mossadegh thought was the right of the people to
profit and pay for services in the country with). Those oil fields were under
the control of British Petroleum, but unfortunately Mossadegh overruled this
long standing business control.
The United States sent Kermit Roosevelt,
FDRs nephew and CIA coordinator in to figure out the mess.
The best he could come up with was to confront Mossadegh and have him
overthrown and this was accomplished by bringing in what the agency refers
to as jackals.
The United States backed the return of the Shah of Iran, one
of the most brutal dictators the country had ever seen and intentionally
overthrew years before with the democratic leader, Mossadegh. Until 1979,
that is, when a pissed off Iranian populace finally revolted and replaced
the monarchy with an anti-West Islamic Republic.
The result was a violently
anti-American revolution lead by the Ayatollah Khomeini which overthrew the
Shah and took hostage US Embassy workers, many of whom were involved in the
plot with Kermit Roosevelt that installed the Shah.
The planning for the Coup
took place largely in that embassy, but Americans were told this was due to
the rise of radical Islam and rise of democracy hating Muslims, which of
course was far from the truth.
19. Operation Snow White
Some time during the 1970s, the
Church of
Scientology decided that they'd had enough.
Apparently, the Church of
Scientology managed to perform the largest infiltration of the United States
government in history. Ever.5,000 of Scientology's crack commandos
wiretapped and burglarized various agencies.
They stole hundreds of
documents, mainly from the IRS. No critic was spared, and in the end, 136
organizations, agencies and foreign embassies were infiltrated.
Grand Jury Charges, Introduction,
"United States of America v. Mary Sue
Hubbard",
United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 1979.
As early as 1960, L. Ron Hubbard had proposed that Scientologists should
infiltrate government departments by taking secretarial, bodyguard or other
jobs.
In the early 1970s, the Church of Scientology was increasingly
scrutinized by US federal agencies, having already been raided by the Food
and Drug Administration in 1963.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claimed
it owed millions of dollars in taxes and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) sent agents into the organization. The Church's response involved a
publicity campaign, extensive litigation against the IRS and a program of
infiltration of agency offices.
The specific branch of Scientology responsible for
Operation Snow White was
the Guardian's Office. Created in 1966 by L. Ron Hubbard himself, the
Guardian's Office's purpose was to protect the interests of Scientology.
At
the time of Operation Snow White, the Guardian's Office had worldwide
headquarters (Guardians Office WW) located at Saint Hill Manor in England.
Headquarters in the United States (Guardians Office US) were in Los
Angeles, California. A smaller office also existed in Washington, D.C.
(Guardians Office DC) and other cities throughout the United States.
Each
of the Guardian Offices had five bureaus including the Information Bureau
which oversaw the infiltration of the government.
L. Ron Hubbard oversaw the
Guardian's Office, though it was Mary Sue Hubbard, his wife, who held the
title Commodore Staff Guardian.
Several years later, in 1973, the Guardian's Office began a massive
infiltration of governments around the world, though the primary target of
the operation was the United States. Worried about Scientologys long term
reputation, the Guardians Office decided to infiltrate Interpol in order to
obtain documents relating to Scientology, as well as those connecting L. Ron
Hubbard to criminal activity.
This duty was handed by Jane Kember to Henning
Heldt and his staff.
Around this time L. Ron Hubbard himself wrote Guardian Order 732, which
called for the removal and correction of erroneous Scientology files. It
is here that Operation Snow White has its origins. Though the order called
for this to be achieved by legal means, this would quickly change. Hubbard
himself would later be named by federal prosecutors as an "unindicted
co-conspirator" for his part in the operation.
Though extensive records of
his involvement exist, many Scientologists claim his directives were
misinterpreted by his followers.
Operation Snow White would be further refined by Guardian Order 1361.
Addressed from Jane Kember to Heldt, Duke Snider, and Richard Weigand, GO
1361 called for, amongst other things, an infiltration of the Los Angeles
and London offices of the IRS, and the Department of Justice.
While the order was specific to the IRS, the Guardians Office was soon
recruiting their own field agents to infiltrate other governmental offices,
including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Coast Guard
intelligence service, and the National Institute of Mental Health, among
others, as well as the American Medical Association.
The program called for
rewards to be given for successful missions carried out by Scientologists.
Other planned elements of the operation included petitioning governments and
the United Nations to charge government critics of Scientology with
genocide, on the theory that official criticism of the group constituted,
"deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring
about its physical destruction".
One of the sentencing memoranda in the case
also noted that, contrary to what the defendants claimed, the programs
planned by the Guardian's Office were not restricted to trying to remove
"false reports" but included plans to plant false information - for instance,
planting false records about "a cat with a pedigree name" into US security
agency computers so that later "the creature holds a press conference and
photographic story results."
The purpose of this plan was,
"to hold up the
American security to ridicule, as outlined in the GO by LRH."
The start of 1974 saw a Michael Meisner appointed Assistant Guardian for
Information in the District of Columbia (AG I DC).
Meisners
responsibilities now included the implementation of all Information Bureau
orders, programs, and projects within the DC area. Meisners supervisor at
this time was Duke Snider, the Assistant Guardian for DC, or AG DC. This was
the highest position in Washingtons GO office.
In July 1974 Meisner was ordered by
Duke Snider to implement the previously
written plan to obtain Interpol documents, which were then located in the
U.S. Department of the Treasury. Meisner had more to do than just this,
though, as by August he was also taking directions from a Cindy Raymond, the
GO's Collections Officer for the US, who ordered Meisner to assist her in
finding a loyal Scientologist agent to gain employment at the IRS
headquarters in Washington DC.
This employee was to steal all documents
dealing with Scientology, especially those involving current litigation by
Scientology against the government. Meisner discussed this with Raymond for
a period of a month before interviewing various Scientologists with no luck.
A month after the order had been given, Raymond informed Meisner that she
had selected Gerald Wolfe.
20. Operation Gladio
Gladio is a code name denoting the clandestine NATO
"stay-behind" operation in Italy after World War II, intended to continue
anti-communist resistance in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western
Europe.
Although Gladio specifically refers to the Italian branch of the
NATO stay-behind organizations, "Operation Gladio" is used as an informal
name for all stay-behind organizations, sometimes called "Super NATO".
The role of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in sponsoring Gladio and
the extent of its activities during the Cold War era, and its relationship
to right-wing terrorist attacks perpetrated in Italy during the Years of
Lead and other similar clandestine operations is the subject of ongoing
debate and investigation. Italy, Switzerland and Belgium have had
parliamentary inquiries into the matter.
What can we prove about that
role? Thousands of documents, depositions and testimony as well as recorded
conversations and admission by the highest levels of government in
Italy. Thats about as credible as it gets, regardless of the CIAs adamant
denial it ever happened.
What took place? The shooting of innocent civilians,
terrorism and assassinations all blamed on leftist communists were actually
apart of well coordinated, black operations.
Black operations are typically
involving activities that are highly clandestine and, often, outside of
standard military protocol.
The right hand doesnt know what the left hand is doing.
Black ops missions
often fit into the deniable category, a situation in which there is no claim
of responsibility for the action, and/or a false flag operation is used to
give the appearance that another actor was responsible, or - most often - black operations involve extensive arrangements so as to be able to hide the
fact that the black operation ever occurred.
Black military operations, or
paramilitary operations, can be used by various secret services to achieve
or attempt to achieve an unusually sensitive goal. The methods used in black
operations are also used in unconventional warfare. Depending on the precise
situation in a given case, and the level of authoritarianism of the national
government or other responsible party, some tasks will be conducted as black
operations, while there are usually other activities that can be admitted
openly.
Black operations may include such things as assassination, sabotage,
extortion, spying on allied countries or one's own citizens, kidnapping,
supporting resistance movements, torture, use of fraud to obtain funds, use
of child soldiers, human experimentation, trafficking in contraband items,
etc.
Since 9/11, many black operations and long time unethical standings have
been approved for legality in the war on terror.
In other words, since
September 11th, 2001, it is no a longer conspiracy for any of this to occur,
a simple decision by a top level military or CIA official is enough, without
oversight or even one thread of admission by the Government or Private
conspirators. Much of the Black operations today are performed by private
contract companies like
Blackwater (now Xe).

documentary banned in the United States that was allowed to air on
BBC.
21. The CIA Assassinates A Lot of People (Church Committee)
The Church
Committee is the common term referring to the United States Senate Select
Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence
Activities, a U.S. Senate committee chaired by Senator Frank Church in 1975.
A precursor to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the
committee investigated intelligence gathering for illegality by the CIA and
FBI after certain activities had been revealed by the Watergate affair.
The
Committee uncovered, among many other things, that the CIA had violated its
charter to perform only gathering of intelligence.
For example, the assassinations of Allende in Chile and Mossadegh in Iran.
Assassinations against Central and South American leaders and
revolutionaries, as well as Africa, Middle East and East Asia. The list was
tremendous.
They even declassified a Heart Attack Gun the Agency had made
for the use of killing someone without it being detected. Cancer, car
accidents, skiing accidents, suicide, boating accidents, heart attacks, and
just plain being shot were common assassination methods. The hearings,
although recorded in full in congressional record, the mainstream media and
official policies, is still largely not taught in American schools on recent
history.
The American public still has no idea this was ever actually
confirmed or even took place. It is common for people to still refer to any
of these assassinations as a joke or made up conspiracy.
Watch "Secrets
of The CIA".
22. The New World Order
This popular conspiracy theory claims that a small
group of international elites controls and manipulates governments, industry
and media organizations worldwide.
The primary tool they use to dominate
nations is the system of central banking. They are said to have funded and
in some cases caused most of the major wars of the last 200 years, primarily
through carrying out false flag attacks to manipulate populations into
supporting them, and have a grip on the world economy, deliberately causing
inflation and depressions at will.
The people behind
the New World Order are
thought to be international bankers, in particular the owners of the private
banks in the
Federal Reserve System, Bank of England and other central
banks, and members of the
Now, although this conspiracy theory was
ridiculed for years, it turns out that the Bilderberg does meet and requests
no media coverage. They receive no media coverage.
The worlds elite meet
every year and it goes largely unreported, for what?
Discussions at the meetings include the economy, world affairs, war and in
general, world policy. After the financial collapse, the Bilderberg played a
key role in proposing that the world prepare for a new world order and have
a standard world currency.
This was proposed shortly after by almost all
attendees of the Bilderberg meeting.
During the 20th century, many statesmen,
such as Woodrow Wilson and Winston Churchill, used the term "new world
order" to refer to a new period of history evidencing a dramatic change in
world political thought and the balance of power after World War I and World
War II.
They all saw these periods as opportunities to implement idealistic or
liberal proposals for global governance only in the sense of new collective
efforts to identify, understand, or address worldwide problems that go
beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to solve.
These proposals
led to the creation of international organizations, such as the United
Nations and N.A.T.O., and international regimes, such as the Bretton Woods
system and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which were calculated
both to maintain a balance of power as well as regularize cooperation
between nations, in order to achieve a peaceful phase of capitalism.
In the aftermath of the two World Wars, progressives welcomed these new
international organizations and regimes but argued they suffered from a
democratic deficit and therefore were inadequate to not only prevent another
global war but also foster global justice. American banker
David Rockefeller
joined the Council on Foreign Relations as its youngest-ever director in
1949 and subsequently became chairman of the board from 1970 to 1985; today
he serves as honorary chairman.
In 2002, Rockefeller authored his
autobiography Memoirs wherein, on page 405, he wrote:
"For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the
political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents ... to attack
the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over
American political and economic institutions.
Some even believe we are part
of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States,
characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring
with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and
economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand
guilty, and I am proud of it."
Thus, activists around the globe formed a world federalist movement bent on
creating a "real" new world order.
A number of Fabian socialist
intellectuals, such as British writer H. G. Wells in the 1940s, appropriated
and redefined the term "new world order" as a synonym for the establishment
of a full-fledged social democratic world government.
In the 1960s, a great
deal of right-wing conspiracist attention, by groups like the John Birch
Society and the Liberty Lobby, focused on the United Nations as the vehicle
for creating the "One World Government", and contributed to a conservative
movement for United States withdrawal from the U.N.. American writer Mary M.
Davison, in her 1966 booklet The Profound Revolution, traced the alleged New
World Order conspiracy to the creation of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in
1913 by international bankers, who she claimed later formed the Council on
Foreign Relations in 1921 as the shadow government.
At the time the booklet
was published, "international bankers" would have been interpreted by many
readers as a reference to a postulated "international banking conspiracy"
masterminded by
the Rothschilds and
Rockefellers.
American televangelist Pat
Robertson with his 1991 best-selling book The New World Order became the
most prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent
American history as a theater in which Wall Street, the Federal Reserve
System, Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg Group, and Trilateral
Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging us
constantly and covertly in the direction of world government for the
Antichrist.
After the turn of the century, specifically during the financial crisis of
2007-2009, many politicians and pundits, such as Gordon Brown, Henry
Kissinger, and Barack Obama, used the term "new world order" in their
advocacy for a Keynesian reform of the global financial system and their
calls for a "New Bretton Woods", which takes into account emerging markets
such as China and India.
These declarations had the unintended consequence
of providing fresh fodder for New World Order conspiracism, and culminated
in former Clinton administration adviser Dick Morris and conservative talk
show host Sean Hannity arguing on one of his Fox News Channel programs that
"conspiracy theorists were right".
In 2009, American film directors
Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New
World Order, a critically-acclaimed documentary film which explores the
world of conspiracy theorists, such as American radio host Alex Jones, who
are committed to exposing and vigorously opposing what they perceive to be
an emerging New World Order.
May 24, 1992 Report on New World Order:
23. Kennedy Assassination -
The 2nd Investigation by Congress Few People Know
About, United States House of Representatives Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA)
The HSCA was established in 1976 to investigate the
John F. Kennedy assassination and the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination.
The Committee investigated until 1978, and in 1979 issued its final report,
concluding that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated by a
conspiracy involving the mob, and potentially the CIA.
The House Select
Committee on Assassinations undertook reinvestigations of the murders of
John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1979, a single Report and
twelve volumes of appendices on each assassination were published by the
Congress.
In the JFK case, the HSCA found that there was a "probable
conspiracy," though it was unable to determine the nature of that conspiracy
or its other participants (besides Oswald).
This finding was based in part on acoustics evidence from a tape purported
to record the shots, but was also based on other evidence including an
investigation of Ruby's Mafia connections and potential CIA and/or FBI
connections to Oswald. To this day, many conspiracy deniers are unaware that
the Congressional investigation into JFKs assassination concluded beyond
any shadow of a doubt that it was a conspiracy.
What made them come to this
conclusion?
Aside from reading the report, many witnesses (some of whom were CIA agents
and station chiefs in Dallas that morning) were killed the night before
testifying.
For example, George de Mohrenschildt was a petroleum geologist
who befriended Lee Harvey Oswald during the months preceding the
assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. He also worked for the
CIA.
He also blew his brains out the night before he was to testify to the
committee. The committee also uncovered, among many things, that Oswald left
the marines where he learned how to speak fluent Russian (at the height of
the cold war).
He was given money by the State Department to travel to Russia
where he stopped off in Japan at a top secret US Military facility. The
Warren Commission even mentioned this part. What most people do not know is
that he probably was working in the Cold War infiltrating the Russians as
either a dangle, double agent, or defector" of some kind.
What is interesting is that upon his return he got more money from the State
Department to buy a house and work with an ex FBI Chief and CIA officials in
training anti-Castro Cubans for an invasion.
In Louisiana, where he was
working, the CIA was involved in
Operation Mongoose, where Oswald worked
under CIA Agent David Ferrie, who killed himself before testifying in a
trial on the Assassination as well. Operation Mongoose worked closely with
Southern Mafia figures largely because the casinos in Cuba, which were shut
down after Fidel obtained control over the country, were epicenters for
control on the island.
The CIA even hired the Mafia to assassinate Fidel on many occasions, 3
attempts which failed are common knowledge.
What is funny is that figures who
worked very close with Oswald either ended up dead (over 100 of them
connected to the assassination died within a few years of unusual
circumstances) or they ended up in other conspiracies.
For instance,
E. Howard Hunt (CIA Agent) confessed to being involved in the
conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy on his deathbed.
E Howard Hunt was one of
the Watergate Burglars. Barry Seal, who worked with Oswald and Ferrie ended
up being one of the largest cocaine smugglers in the United States during
Iran Contra, as a key player for the agency and informant for the DEA.
There
is so much more to get into, but there just isnt enough time. Oswald's tax
returns are still classified top secret to this day. Why? Perhaps he was
still getting $$ from the United States, which places him on the payroll.
That money trail leads to figures, many of whom were murdered, that would
have blown the story wide open. For 14 years, most didn't know this.
The HSCA investigations by congress went against the findings of the Warren
Commission and both reports are from the same source, Congressional
Committees.
Which is true? Why do we only teach one to our children in

The 1919 World Series (often referred to as
the
Black Sox Scandal) resulted in the most famous scandal in baseball
history.
Eight players from the Chicago White Sox (nicknamed the Black Sox)
were accused of throwing the series against the Cincinnati Reds. Details of
the scandal remain controversial, and the extent to which each player was
involved varied.
It was, however, front-page news across the country when
the story was uncovered late in the 1920 season, and despite being acquitted
of criminal charges (throwing baseball games was technically not a crime),
the eight players were banned from organized baseball (i.e. the leagues
subject to the National Agreement) for life.
There are hundreds of other
conspiracies involving throwing games, sporting matches and large scale
entertainment events. It is common knowledge for many, this list would have
to go into the thousands if we included all of them.
25. Karen Silkwood
Karen was an American labor union activist and chemical
technician at the Kerr-McGee plant near Crescent, Oklahoma, United States. Silkwood's job was making plutonium pellets for nuclear reactor fuel
rods.
After being hired at Kerr-McGee, Silkwood joined the Oil, Chemical &
Atomic Workers Union local and took part in a strike at the plant. After the
strike ended, she was elected to the union's bargaining committee and
assigned to investigate health and safety issues.
She discovered what she
believed to be numerous violations of health regulations, including exposure
of workers to contamination, faulty respiratory equipment and improper
storage of samples. She also believed the lack of sufficient shower
facilities could increase the risk of employee contamination.
In the summer of 1974, Silkwood testified to the
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)
about these issues, alleging that safety standards had slipped because of a
production speedup which resulted in employees being given tasks for which
they were poorly trained. She also alleged that Kerr-McGee employees handled
the fuel rods improperly and that the company falsified inspection
records.
On November 5, 1974, Silkwood performed a routine self-check and
found almost 400 times the legal limit for plutonium contamination. She was
decontaminated at the plant and sent home with a testing kit to collect
urine and feces for further analysis. Oddly, though there was plutonium on
the exterior surfaces (the ones she touched) of the gloves she had been
using, the gloves did not have any holes.
This suggests the contamination did not come from inside the glove box, but
from some other source, in other words, someone was trying to poison her.
The
next morning, as she headed to a union negotiation meeting, she again tested
positive for plutonium. This was surprising because she had only performed
paperwork duties that morning. She was given a more intense decontamination.
The following day, November 7, 1974, as she entered the plant, she was found
to be dangerously contaminated - even expelling contaminated air from her
lungs.
A health physics team accompanied her back to her home and found
plutonium traces on several surfaces - especially in the bathroom and the
refrigerator.
The house was later stripped and decontaminated. Silkwood, her partner and
housemate were sent to Los Alamos National Laboratory for in-depth testing
to determine the extent of the contamination in their bodies. Later that
evening, Silkwood's body was found in her car, which had run off the road
and struck a culvert. The car contained no documents.
She was pronounced
dead at the scene from a "classic, one-car sleeping-driver accident".
26. CIA Drug Smuggling in Arkansas
August 23, 1987, in a rural community just
south of Little Rock, police officers murdered two teenage boys because they
witnessed a police-protected drug drop. The drop was part of a drug smuggling
operation based at a small airport in Mena, Arkansas.
The Mena operation was
set up in the early 1980's by the notorious drug smuggler, Barry Seal.
Facing prison after a drug conviction in Florida, Seal flew to Washington,
D.C., where he put together a deal that allowed him to avoid prison by
becoming an informant for the government.
As a government informant against
drug smugglers, Seal testified he worked for the CIA and the DEA. In one
federal court case, he testified that his income from March 1984 to August
1985, was between $700,000 and $800,000. This period was AFTER making his
deal with the government.
Seal testified that nearly $600,000 of this came from smuggling drugs while
working for - and with the permission of the DEA. In addition to his duties
as an informant, Seal was used by CIA operatives to help finance the
Nicaraguan Contras. The CIA connection to the Mena operation was undeniable
when a cargo plane given to Seal by the CIA was shot down over Nicaragua
with a load of weapons.
In spite of the evidence, every investigator who has
tried to expose the crimes of Mena has been professionally destroyed, and
those involved in drug smuggling operations have received continued
protection from state and federal authorities.

Bohemian Grove
For years, many conspiracy theorists were saying that the
rich and powerful met every year in the woods and worshiped a giant stone
owl in an occult fashion.
It turns out, ABC, CBS, NBC, and many other
credible news agencies investigated this and found out, its true. It is said
to be just all fun and games, like brotherhood style fraternity stuff.
These clips can be
viewed here.
28. Operation Paperclip
Operation Paperclip was the code name for the 1945
Office of Strategic Services, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency
recruitment of German scientists from Nazi Germany to the U.S. after VE
Day.
President Truman authorized Operation Paperclip in August 1945; however
he expressly ordered that anyone found "to have been a member of the Nazi
party and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active
supporter of Nazi militarism" would be excluded.
These included Wernher von
Braun, Arthur Rudolph and Hubertus Strughold, who were all officially on
record as Nazis and listed as a "menace to the security of the Allied
Forces." All were cleared to work in the U.S. after having their backgrounds
"bleached" by the military; false employment histories were provided, and
their previous Nazi affiliations were expunged from the record.
The
paperclips that secured newly-minted background details to their personnel
files gave the operation its name.
29.
The Round Table
British businessman Cecil Rhodes advocated the British
Empire re-annexing the United States of America and reforming itself into an
"Imperial Federation" to bring about a hyperpower and lasting world peace.
In his first will, of 1877, written at the age of 23, he expressed his wish
to fund a secret society (known as the Society of the Elect) that would
advance this goal:
To and for the establishment, promotion and development
of a Secret Society, the true aim and object whereof shall be for the
extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system
of emigration from the United Kingdom, and of colonization by British
subjects of all lands where the means of livelihood are attainable by
energy, labor and enterprise, and especially the occupation by British
settlers of the entire Continent of Africa, the Holy Land, the Valley of the
Euphrates, the Islands of Cyprus and Candia, the whole of South America, the
Islands of the Pacific not heretofore possessed by Great Britain, the whole
of the Malay Archipelago, the seaboard of China and Japan, the ultimate
recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British
Empire, the inauguration of a system of Colonial representation in the
Imperial Parliament which may tend to weld together the disjointed members
of the Empire and, finally, the foundation of so great a Power as to render
wars impossible, and promote the best interests of humanity.
In his later wills, a more mature Rhodes abandoned the idea and instead
concentrated on what became the Rhodes Scholarship, which had British
statesman Alfred Milner as one of its trustees.
Established in 1902, the
original goal of the trust fund was to foster peace among the great powers
by creating a sense of fraternity and a shared world view among future
British, American, and German leaders by having enabled them to study for
free at the University of Oxford.
Milner and British official Lionel George
Curtis were the architects of the Round Table movement, a network of
organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its self-governing
colonies.
To this end, Curtis founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in
June 1919 and, with his 1938 book The Commonwealth of God, began advocating
for the creation of an imperial federation that eventually re-annexes the
U.S., which would be presented to Protestant churches as being the work of
the Christian God to elicit their support.
The Commonwealth of Nations was
created in 1949 but it would only be a free association of independent
states rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes,
Milner and Curtis.
The
Council on Foreign Relations began in 1917 with a
group of New York academics who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to
offer options for the foreign policy of the United States in the interwar
period.
Originally envisioned as a British-American group of scholars and diplomats,
some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent
group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers
organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of
state, Elihu Root, that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July
1921. The first of the councils projects was a quarterly journal launched
in September 1922, called Foreign Affairs.
Some believe that the Council on
Foreign Relations is a front organization for the Round Table as a tool of
the "Anglo-American Establishment", which they believe has been plotting
from 1900 on to rule the world.
The research findings of historian Carroll Quigley, author of the 1966 book
Tragedy and
Hope, are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American Old
Right (Cleon Skousen) and New Left (Carl Oglesby) to substantiate this view,
even though he argued that the Establishment is not involved in a plot to
implement a one-world government but rather British and American benevolent
imperialism driven by the mutual interests of economic elites in the United
Kingdom and the United States.
Quigley also argued that, although the Round
Table still exists today, its position in influencing the policies of world
leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during World War I and slowly
waned after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis. Today it is largely
a ginger group, designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of
the Commonwealth of Nations, but faces strong opposition.
Furthermore, in
American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no
elite was in charge and acting responsibly.
American banker David Rockefeller joined the Council on Foreign Relations as
its youngest-ever director in 1949 and subsequently became chairman of the
board from 1970 to 1985; today he serves as honorary chairman.
In 2002,
Rockefeller authored his autobiography Memoirs wherein, on page 405, he
wrote:
For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the
political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents... to attack
the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over
American political and economic institutions.
Some even believe we are part
of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States,
characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring
with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and
economic structure - one world, if you will.
If that's the charge, I stand
guilty, and I am proud of it.
Barkun argues that this statement is partly
facetious (the claim of "conspiracy" or "treason") and partly serious
- the
desire to encourage trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Europe, and
Japan, for example - an ideal that used to be a hallmark of the
internationalist wing of the Republican Party when there was an
internationalist wing.
However, the statement is taken at face value and widely cited by conspiracy
theorists as proof that the Council on Foreign Relations (itself alleged to
be a front for an "international banking cabal", as well as, it is claimed,
the sponsor of many "globalist" think tanks such as the Trilateral
Commission) uses its role as the brain trust of American presidents,
senators and representatives to manipulate them into supporting a New World
Order.
Conspiracy theorists fear that the international bankers of financial
capitalism are planning to eventually subvert the independence of the U.S.
by subordinating national sovereignty to a strengthened Bank for
International Settlements with the intent to,
create a world system of
financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of
each country and the economy of the world as a whole.
In a 13 November 2007
interview with Canadian journalist Benjamin Fulford, Rockefeller countered:
I don't think that I really feel that we need a world government. We need
governments of the world that work together and collaborate. But, I can't
imagine that there would be any likelihood or even that it would be
desirable to have a single government elected by the people of the world...
There have been people, ever since I've had any kind of position in the
world, who have accused me of being ruler of the world. I have to say that I
think for the large part, I would have to decide to describe them as
crackpots. It makes no sense whatsoever, and isn't true, and won't be true,
and to raise it as a serious issue seems to me to be irresponsible.
Some American social critics, such as Laurence H. Shoup, argue that the
Council on Foreign Relations is an "imperial brain trust", which has, for
decades, played a central behind-the-scenes role in shaping U.S. foreign
policy choices for the post-WWII international order and the Cold War, by
determining what options show up on the agenda and what options do not even
make it to the table; while others, such as G. William Domhoff, argue that
it is in fact a mere policy discussion forum, which provides the business
input to U.S. foreign policy planning.
The latter argue that it has nearly
3,000 members, far too many for secret plans to be kept within the group;
all the council does is sponsor discussion groups, debates and speakers; and
as far as being secretive, it issues annual reports and allows access to its
historical archives.
30. The Illuminati
The
Order of the Illuminati was an Enlightenment-age
secret society founded on May 1st, 1776, in Ingolstadt (Upper Bavaria), by
Adam Weishaupt, who was the first lay professor of canon law at the
University of Ingolstadt.
The movement consisted of freethinkers,
secularists, liberals, republicans and pro-feminists, recruited in the
Masonic Lodges of Germany, who sought to promote perfectionism through
mystery schools.
As a result, in 1785, the order was infiltrated, broken and
suppressed by the government agents of Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria,
in his campaign to neutralize the threat of secret societies ever becoming
hotbeds of conspiracies to overthrow the monarchy and state religion.
In the
late 18th century, reactionary conspiracy theorists, such as Scottish
physicist John Robison and French Jesuit priest Augustin Barruel, began
speculating that the Illuminati survived their suppression and became the
masterminds behind the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror.
The Illuminati were accused of being enlightened absolutists who were
attempting to secretly orchestrate a world revolution in order to globalize
the most radical ideals of the Enlightenment: anti-clericalism,
anti-monarchism, and anti-patriarchalism. During the 19th century, fear of
an Illuminati conspiracy was a real concern of European ruling classes, and
their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 the very
revolutions they sought to prevent.
Although many say that the Illuminati was
disbanded and destroyed so long ago, it is well known that the Rothschild
dynasty following the familys involvement in the secret order in Bavaria
received much attention for its major takeover of Europes central banks.
The
Rothschild dynasty owns roughly half of the worlds wealth and evidence
suggests it has funded both sides of major wars, including the United States
Civil War.
31. The Trilateral Commission
The
Trilateral Commission is a private
organization, established to foster closer cooperation among the United
States, Europe and Japan.
It was founded in July 1973 at the initiative of
David Rockefeller, who was Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at
that time. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the
Council on Foreign Relations.
In July 1972, Rockefeller called his first
meeting, which was held at Rockefeller's Pocantico compound in New York's
Hudson Valley. It was attended by about 250 individuals who were carefully
selected and screened by Rockefeller and represented the very elite of
finance and industry.
Its first executive committee meeting was held in Tokyo
in October 1973. The Trilateral Commission was officially initiated, holding
biannual meetings.
A Trilateral Commission Task Force Report, presented at the 1975 meeting in
Kyoto, Japan, called An Outline for Remaking World Trade and Finance, said:
"Close Trilateral cooperation in keeping the peace, in managing the world
economy, and in fostering economic development and in alleviating world
poverty, will improve the chances of a smooth and peaceful evolution of the
global system."
Another Commission document read:
"The overriding goal is to
make the world safe for interdependence by protecting the benefits which it
provides for each country against external and internal threats which will
constantly emerge from those willing to pay a price for more national
autonomy.
This may sometimes require slowing the pace at which
interdependence proceeds, and checking some aspects of it. More frequently
however, it will call for checking the intrusion of national government into
the international exchange of both economic and non-economic goods."

May 2, 1995 News Clip on Trilateral Commission:
32. Big Brother or the Shadow Government
It is also called the Deep State
by Peter Dale Scott, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
A
shadow government is a "government-in-waiting" that remains in waiting
with the intention of taking control of a government in response to some event. It turned out this was true on 9/11, when it was told to us by our
mainstream media. For years, this was ridiculed as a silly, crazy conspiracy
theory and, like the others listed here, turned out to be 100% true. It is
also called the
Continuity of Government.
The Continuity of Government (COG)
is the principle of establishing defined procedures that allow a government
to continue its essential operations in case of nuclear war or other
catastrophic event. Since the end of the cold war, the policies and
procedures for the COG have been altered according to realistic threats of
that time.
These include but are not limited to a possible coup or overthrow
by right wing terrorist groups, a terrorist attack in general, an
assassination, and so on. Believe it or not the COG has been in effect since
2001.After 9/11, it went into action.
Now here is the kicker, many of the
figures in Iran Contra, the Watergate Scandal, the alleged conspiracy to
assassinate Kennedy, and many others listed here are indeed members of the
COG. This is its own conspiracy as well.
The Secret Team:
The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and
the World is a book written by Air Force Col. L Fletcher Prouty, published
in 1973.
From 1955 to 1963 Prouty was the "Focal Point Officer" for contacts
between the CIA and the Pentagon on matters relating to military support for
"black operations" but he was not assigned to the CIA and was not bound by
any oath of secrecy. (From the first page of the 1974 Printing)
It was one
of the first tell-all books about the inner workings of the CIA and was an
important influence on the Oliver Stone movie JFK. But the main thrust of
the book is how the CIA started as a think tank to analyze intelligence
gathered from military sources but has grown to the monster it has become.
The CIA had no authority to run their own agents or to carry out covert
operations but they quickly did both and much more.
This book tells about things they actually did and a lot about how the
operate. In Prouty's own words, from the 1997 edition of The Secret Team:
This is the fundamental game of the Secret Team. They have this power
because they control secrecy and secret intelligence and because they have
the ability to take advantage of the most modern communications system in
the world, of global transportation systems, of quantities of weapons of all
kinds, and when needed, the full support of a world-wide U.S. military
supporting base structure.
They can use the finest intelligence system in
the world, and most importantly, they have been able to operate under the
canopy of an assumed, ever-present enemy called "Communism." It will be
interesting to see what "enemy" develops in the years ahead. It appears that
"UFO's and Aliens" are being primed to fulfill that role for the future.
To
top all of this, there is the fact that the CIA, itself, has assumed the
right to generate and direct secret operations.
"He is not the first to
allege that UFOs and Aliens are going to be used as a threat against the
world to globalize the planet under One government."
The
Report from Iron Mountain
The
Report from Iron Mountain is a book, published in 1967 (during the
Johnson Administration) by Dial Press, that states that it is the report of
a government panel.
According to the report, a 15-member panel, called the
Special Study Group, was set up in 1963 to examine what problems would occur
if the U.S. entered a state of lasting peace.
They met at an underground
nuclear bunker called Iron Mountain (as well as other, worldwide locations)
and worked over the next two years. Iron Mountain is where the government
has stored the flight 93 evidence from 9/11.A member of the panel, one "John
Doe", a professor at a college in the Midwest, decided to release the report
to the public.
The heavily footnoted report concluded that peace was not in the interest of
a stable society, that even if lasting peace,
"could be achieved, it would
almost certainly not be in the best interests of society to achieve it."
War
was a part of the economy.
Therefore, it was necessary to conceive a state
of war for a stable economy. The government, the group theorized, would not
exist without war, and nation states existed in order to wage war. War also
served a vital function of diverting collective aggression. They recommended
that bodies be created to emulate the economic functions of war.
They also
recommended "blood games" and that the government create alternative foes
that would scare the people with reports of alien life-forms and out of
control pollution.
Another proposal was the reinstitution of slavery.
U.S. News and World Report
claimed in its November 20, 1967 issue to have confirmation of the reality
of the report from an unnamed government official, who added that when
President Johnson read the report, he 'hit the roof' and ordered it to be
suppressed for all time.
Additionally, sources were said to have revealed
that orders were sent to U.S. embassies, instructing them to emphasize that
the book had no relation to U.S. Government policy.
Project Blue Beam is also
a common conspiracy theory that alleges that a faked alien landing would be
used as a means of scaring the public into whatever global system is
suggested. Some researchers suggest the
Report from Iron Mountain might be
fabricated, others swear it is real.
Bill Moyers, the American journalist and public commentator, has served as
White House Press Secretary in the United States President Lyndon B. Johnson
Administration from 1965 to 1967. He worked as a news commentator on
television for ten years. Moyers has had an extensive involvement with
public television, producing documentaries and news journal programs.
He has
won numerous awards and honorary degrees. He has become well known as a
trenchant critic of the U.S. media. Since 1990, Moyers has been President of
the Schumann Center for Media and Democracy. He is considered by many to be
a very credible outlet for the truth. He released a documentary titled, The
Secret Government, which exposed the inner workings of a secret government
much more vast that most people would ever imagine.
Though originally
broadcast in 1987, it is even more relevant today. Interviews with respected
top military, intelligence, and government insiders reveal both the history
and secret objectives of powerful groups in the hidden shadows of our
government.
Here is that documentary:

the secret government produced by BBC,

The intrepid BBC team clearly shows how the
War on Terror is
largely a fabrication.

the composition of the shadow or secret government from a less well-known
source, take a look at the summary

33. The Federal Reserve Bank
The fundamental promise of a central bank like
the Federal Reserve is economic stability.
The theory is that manipulating
the value of the currency allows financial booms to go higher, and crashes
to be more mild. If growth becomes speculative and unsustainable, the
central bank can make the price of money go up and force some deleveraging
of risky investments - again, promising to make the crashes more mild.
The
period leading up to the American revolution was characterized by
increasingly authoritarian legislation from England. Acts passed in 1764 had
a particularly harsh effect on the previously robust colonial economy.
The
Sugar Act was in effect a tax cut on easily smuggled molasses, and a new tax
on commodities that England more directly controlled trade over. The navy
would be used in increased capacity to enforce trade laws and collect
duties.
Perhaps even more significant than the militarization and expansion
of taxes was the Currency Act passed later in the year 1764.
"The colonies suffered a constant shortage of currency with which to conduct
trade. There were no gold or silver mines and currency could only be
obtained through trade as regulated by Great Britain. Many of the colonies
felt no alternative to printing their own paper money in the form of Bills
of Credit."
The result was a true free market of currency - each bank
competed, exchange rates fluctuated wildly, and merchants were hesitant to
accept these notes as payment.
Of course, they didn't have 24-hour digital Forex markets, but I'll hold off opinions on the viability of unregulated
currency for another time.
England's response was to seize control of the colonial money supply -
forbidding banks, cities, and colony governments from printing their own.
This law, passed so soon after the Sugar Act, started to really bring
revolutionary tension inside the colonies to a higher level.
American
bankers had learned early on that debasing a currency through inflation is a
helpful way to pay off perpetual trade deficits - but Britain proved that
the buyer of the currency would only take the deal for so long...
Following
the (first) American Revolution, the "First Bank of the United States" was
chartered to pay off collective war debts, and effectively distribute the
cost of the revolution proportionately throughout all of the states.
Although the bank had vocal and harsh skeptics, it only controlled about 20%
of the nation's money supply.
Compared to today's central bank, it was nothing.
Thomas Jefferson argued
vocally against the institution of the bank, mostly citing constitutional
concerns and the limitations of government found in the 10th amendment.
There was one additional quote that hints at the deeper structural flaw of a
central bank in a supposedly free capitalist economy.
"The existing banks
will, without a doubt, enter into arrangements for lending their agency, and
the more favorable, as there will be a competition among them for it;
whereas the bill delivers us up bound to the national bank, who are free to
refuse all arrangement, but on their own terms, and the public not free, on
such refusal, to employ any other bank"
Thomas Jefferson.Basically, the
existing banks will fight over gaining favor with the central bank - rather
than improving their performance relative to a free market.
The profit margins associated with collusion would obviously outweigh the
potential profits gained from legitimate business.
The Second Bank of the
United States was passed five years after the first bank's charter expired.
An early enemy of central banking, President James Madison, was looking for
a way to stabilize the currency in 1816. This bank was also quite temporary
- it would only stay in operation until 1833 when President Andrew Jackson
would end federal deposits at the institution.
The charter expired in 1836 and the private corporation was bankrupt and
liquidated by 1841.While the South had been the major opponent of central
banking systems, the end of the Civil War allowed for (and also made
necessary) the system of national banks that would dominate the next fifty
years.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) says that this
post-war period of a unified national currency and system of national banks
"worked well." [3] Taxes on state banks were imposed to encourage people to
use the national banks - but liquidity problems persisted as the money
supply did not match the economic cycles.
Overall, the American economy
continued to grow faster than Europe, but the period did not bring economic
stability by any stretch of the imagination. Several panics and runs on the
bank - and it became a fact of life under this system of competing
nationalized banks. In 1873, 1893, 1901, and 1907 significant panics caused
a series of bank failures.
The new system wasn't stable at all, in fact, many suspected it was
wrought
with fraud and manipulation.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is not
shy about attributing the causes of the Panic of 1907 to financial
manipulation from the existing banking establishment.
"If Knickerbocker
Trust would falter, then Congress and the public would lose faith in all
trust companies and banks would stand to gain, the bankers reasoned."
In
timing with natural economic cycles, major banks including J.P. Morgan and
Chase launched an all-out assault on Heinze's Knickerbocker Trust.
Financial
institutions on the inside started silently selling off assets in the
competitor, and headlines about a few bad loans started making top spots in
the newspapers.
The run on Knickerbocker turned into a general panic - and the Federal
Government would come to the rescue of its privately owned "National
Banks.
"During the Panic of 1907, "Depositors 'run' on the Knickerbocker
Bank. J.P. Morgan and James Stillman of First National City Bank (Citibank)
act as a "central bank," providing liquidity ... [to stop the bank
run] President Theodore Roosevelt provides Morgan with $25 million in
government funds ... to control the panic. Morgan, acting as a one-man
central bank, decides which firms will fail and which firms will
survive."
How did JP Morgan get so powerful that the government would provide
them with funding to increase their power? They had key influence with
positions inside the Administrations.
They had senators, congressmen, lobbyists, media moguls all working for
them.
In 1886, a group of millionaires purchased Jekyll Island and converted
it into a winter retreat and hunting ground, the USA's most exclusive club.
By 1900, the club's roster represented 1/6th of the world's wealth. Names
like Astor, Vanderbilt, Morgan, Pulitzer and Gould filled the club's
register. Non- members, regardless of stature, were not allowed. Dignitaries
like Winston Churchill and President McKinley were refused admission.
In
1908, the year after a national money panic purportedly created by J. P.
Morgan, Congress established, in 1908, a National Monetary Authority. In
1910 another, more secretive, group was formed consisting of the chiefs of
major corporations and banks in this country. The group left secretly by
rail from Hoboken, New Jersey, and traveled anonymously to the hunting lodge
on Jekyll Island.
In fact, the Clubhouse/hotel on the island has two
conference rooms named for the "Federal Reserve." The meeting was so secret
that none referred to the other by his last name. Why the need for secrecy?
Frank Vanderlip wrote later in the Saturday Evening Post,
"...it would have
been fatal to Senator Aldrich's plan to have it known that he was calling on
anybody from Wall Street to help him in preparing his bill...I do not feel
it is any exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as
the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal
Reserve System."
At Jekyll Island, the true draftsman for the Federal Reserve
was Paul Warburg. The plan was simple.
The new central bank could not be called a central bank because America did
not want one, so it had to be given a deceptive name. Ostensibly, the bank
was to be controlled by Congress, but a majority of its members were to be
selected by the private banks that would own its stock.
To keep the public
from thinking that the Federal Reserve would be controlled from New York, a
system of twelve regional banks was designed. Given the concentration of
money and credit in New York, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
controlled the system, making the regional concept initially nothing but a
ruse.
The board and chairman were to be selected by the President, but in the
words of Colonel Edward House, the board would serve such a term as to "put
them out of the power of the President."
The power over the creation of
money was to be taken from the people and placed in the hands of private
bankers who could expand or contract credit as they felt best suited their
needs. Why the opposition to a central bank? Americans at the time knew of the
destruction to the economy the European central banks had caused to their
respective countries and to countries who became their debtors.
They saw the
large- scale government deficit spending and debt creation that occurred in
Europe. But European financial moguls didn't rest until the New World was
within their orbit. In 1902, Paul Warburg, a friend and associate of the Rothschilds and an expert on European central banking, came to this country
as a partner in Kuhn, Loeb and Company.
He married the daughter of Solomon Loeb, one of the founders of the firm.
The head of Kuhn, Loeb was Jacob Schiff, whose gift of $20 million in gold
to the struggling Russian communists in 1917 no doubt saved their
revolution. The Fed controls the banking system in the USA, not the Congress
nor the people indirectly (as the Constitution dictates). The U.S. central
bank strategy is a product of European banking interests.
Government
interventionists got their wish in 1913 with the Federal Reserve (and income
tax amendment). Just in time, too, because the nation needed a new source of
unlimited cash to finance both sides of WW1 and eventually our own entry to
the war.
After the war, with both sides owing us debt through the federal reserve
backed banks, the center of finance moved from London to New York. But did
the Federal Reserve reign in the money trusts and interlocking directorates?
Not by a long shot. If anything, the Federal Reserve granted new powers to
the National Banks by permitting overseas branches and new types of banking
services.
The greatest gift to the bankers, was a virtually unlimited supply
of loans when they experience liquidity problems.
From the early 1920s to 1929, the monetary supply expanded at a rapid pace
and the nation experienced wild economic growth. Curiously, however, the
number of banks started to decline for the first time in American
history. Toward the end of the period, speculation and loose money had
propelled asset and equity prices to unreal levels.
The stock market
crashed, and as the banks struggled with liquidity problems, the Federal
Reserve actually cut the money supply. Without a doubt, this is the greatest
financial panic and economic collapse in American history - and it never
could have happened on this scale without the Fed's intervention.
The number
of banks crashed and a few of the old robber barons' banks managed to swoop
in and grab up thousands of competitors for pennies on the dollar.
