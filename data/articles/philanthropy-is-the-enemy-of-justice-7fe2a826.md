Gates's voice is loud,

It's strange that at this week's World
Economic Forum the designated voice of the world's poor has been
Bill Gates, who has pledged Â£478m to
the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, telling Davos that
the world economic crisis was no excuse for cutting aid.
It reminds me of that dark hour when
Al Gore, despite being a shareholder in
Occidental Petroleum, was the voice of climate change action - because Gates
does not speak with the voice of the world's poor, of course, but with the
voice of its rich.
It's a loud voice, but the model of development
it proclaims is the wrong one because philanthropy is the enemy of justice.
-
Am I saying that philanthropy has never
done good? No, it has achieved many wonderful things.
-
Would I rather people didn't have polio
vaccines than get them from a plutocrat? No, give them the vaccines.
But beware the havoc that power without
oversight and democratic control can wreak.
The biotech agriculture that Lord Sainsbury was unable to push through
democratically he can now implement unilaterally, through his
Gatsby
Foundation. We are told that Gatsby's biotech project aims to provide
food
security for the global south.
But if you listen to southern groups such as the
Karnataka State Farmers of India, food security is precisely the reason they
campaign against GM, because
biotech crops are monocrops which are more
vulnerable to disease and so need lashings of petrochemical pesticides,
insecticides and fungicides - none of them cheap - and whose ruinous costs
will rise with the price of oil, bankrupting small family farms first.
Crop diseases mutate, meanwhile, and all the
chemical inputs in the world can't stop disease wiping out whole harvests of
genetically engineered single strands.
Both the Gatsby and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundations are keen to get
deeper into agriculture, especially in Africa. But top-down nostrums for the
rural poor don't end well. The list of autocratic hubris in
pseudo-scientific farming is long and spectacularly calamitous.
It runs from Tsar Alexander I's model village
colonies in 1820s Novgorod to 1920s Hollywood film producer Hickman Price,
who, as Simon Schama brilliantly describes in The American Future,
"bought 54 square miles of land to show the
little people how it was really done, [and] used 25 combines all painted
glittery silver".
His fleet of tractors were kept working day and
night, and the upshot of such sod-busting was the great plains dustbowl. But
there's no stopping a plutocratic philanthropist in a hurry.
And then there is the vexed question of whether these billions are really
the billionaires' to give away in the first place.
When Microsoft was on its board, the American
Electronics Association,
the AeA, challenged European Union proposals
for a ban on toxic components and for the use of a minimum 5% recycled
plastic in the manufacture of electronic goods.
AeA took the EU to the World Trade Organization on a charge of erecting
artificial trade barriers. (And according to the American NGO Public
Citizen, "made the astounding claim that there is no evidence that heavy
metals, like lead, pose a threat to human health or the environment".)
Now, the EU is big enough and ugly enough to have fought and won the case.
But many an African country lacks the war chest
for such a fight, and so will end up paying for the healthcare of those
exposed to leaky old PCs' cadmium, chromium or mercury, instead of embarking
on, let's say, a nationwide anti-malaria strategy.
Bill Gates himself may not indeed have known
about what the AeA was doing on Microsoft's behalf, but the fact remains
that if a philanthropist's money comes from externalizing corporate costs to
taxpayers, and that if Microsoft is listed for its own tax purposes as a
partly Puerto Rican and Singaporean company, then the real philanthropists
behind these glittering foundations might be a sight more ragged-trousered
than Bill and Melinda.
Free marketeers will spring to the defence of billionaire philanthropists
with a remark like:
"Oh, so you'd rather they spent all their
money selfishly on golf courses and mansions, would you?"
To which I
reply:
"Oh, you mean that trickle-down doesn't work, after all?"
But the point is that the poor are not begging
us for charity, they are demanding justice.
And when, on the occasion of his birthday, a
sultan or emperor reprieved one thousand prisoners sentenced to death, no
one ever called those pardons justice. Nor is it justice when a plutocrat
decides to reprieve untold thousands from malaria.
Human beings should not have to depend upon a
rich man's whim for the right to life.
