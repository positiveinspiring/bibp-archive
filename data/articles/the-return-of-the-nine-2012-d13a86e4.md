What will happen in 2012 - or, in the Mayan calendar, 13.0.0.0.0?
The question has been the subject of many books
and one blockbuster movie. No-one seems to know, but there is ample
speculation: from the return of
Zecharia
Sitchins aliens from the
theoretical
twelfth planet in our solar system to global annihilation,
everyone seems to have an opinion as to what 2012 is about.
It might
therefore come as a surprise that for the Mayan civilization itself - those
who worked the date of December 21, 2012 into their mythology - it was no
mystery at all!
The Mayan prophecy to do with 2012 was that it
would signal the return of "The Nine.
The Nine" are mentioned in an inscription on Monument 6 of the Mayan site
of Tortuguero, in the Mexican state of Tabasco. The monument was erected in
669 AD and is one of the very few pre-Conquest sources that mention 2012.
Various translations or partial translations of the inscription exist.
This
is the most common one:
"At the next creation, the Bolon Yokte Ku, or Nine
Support Gods, will return.
However, the actual word "return, sometimes
translated as "descent, is not intact on the monument.
Still, it is a safe
conclusion to make that the missing word is return. Why? Because other Mayan
sources reference the return of these deities at the ending of each baktun.
Hence, they are expected to emanate on Earth in
2012 too.
Who are the Bolon Yokte Ku - The Nine?
They have variously been translated
as,
-
the God of Nine Strides
-
the Nine-Footed God
-
Jaguar-Foot-Tree
-
Nine-Dog-Tree
They were seen as living in the Underworld and were generally
described as god(s) of conflict, warfare, and are hence linked with
dangerous transition times, social unrest, eclipses, and natural disasters
like earthquakes.
It is said that at the end of a
baktun, they would abandon
their underworld realm and rise to the Earths surface, where they would do
battle with the 13 deities of Heaven.
To further identify what the Nine Support Gods are supposed to be, we need
to consult other sources, in this case, anthropological ones. Such evidence
makes it clear that the Nine Gods appeared during ceremonies that were held
at the end of each baktun, the last of which occurred in 1618 AD.
The ceremonial of the baktun is described in chapter 29 of the
The Book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel, a Mayan chronicle. It provides a detailed
description of the ceremonies that were performed in Merida in 1618 AD, at
the end of 12.0.0.0.0.
In total, there are twenty acts, each representing one of the twenty katuns
that make up a baktun-cycle.
-
After some initial preparations, in act 2, the bee god tied the masks of the
13 gods of Heaven to those people who were going to perform in the
ceremonies.
-
The actual baktun cycle was ended in act 3, whereby
the Nine
Gods fought, conquered and sacrificed these 13 Gods. Night had conquered
day.
-
The subsequent acts involved rituals to do with the election of the new
officials for the new period, while in act 12, the Nine Gods sacrifice the
Seven Pacers and count the mats, which is an initial line-up of the
candidates for investiture for the coming era.
-
In act 13, the 4 year-bearers
reappear, in the guise of the four death gods.
-
Most importantly, in act 15,
the Nine Gods announce the fate of the new era. This fate was largely the
will of the gods, which the community had to achieve during the new era.
In short, the baktun ceremony was therefore a series of rituals, focusing on
the Nine Gods and their emanation and rulings. However, these extraordinary
rituals have seldom been understood for what they are: part and parcel of
the 2012 phenomenon.
The question nevertheless remains as to who these Nine Gods truly are.
Indeed, "Nine Gods" are not just an ingredient of the Mayan culture. There
were also Nine Gods in the ancient Egyptian religion, as well as many others
(e.g. India). To the Egyptians, they were also known as the Nine Principles
and they were directly linked with their Creator Deity, Atum.
Control over these Nine Principles was deemed to be instrumental in the
successful rule of a Pharaoh:
proper control over them meant that balance -
linked with the deity Maat - was maintained and all was well with Egypt,
the world and the universe.
We can therefore see that The Nine in an
Egyptian or Mayan setting, were closely related; in both instances, they
determined the ruling of an era, whereby their consultation was of extreme
importance to the success of the nation.
So are we waiting for their return in
2012? If so, what are we meant to
expect?
Interestingly, since the 1950s, decades before the
2012 phenomenon
rose to prominence, there has been a select number of people that have been
speaking about a "Return of the Nine. For some, this is the return of nine
extra-terrestrial beings, for others this is the return of the Egyptian Nine
Gods.
Some even link The Nine with the nine founding members of
the Knights
Templar order - a concept that, alas, resulted in a series of mass suicides
in France, Switzerland and Canada in the mid 1990s.
However, despite the
mass interest in 2012, until now, no-one has drawn attention to the fact
that for decades, people claimed to be contacting The Nine and the fact that
Mayan inscriptions speak of a return of the Nine Gods in these "end times!
So what are The Nine?
A group led by paranormal researcher Dr.
Andrija
Puharich that
contacted "The Nine"
in the early 1950s. They believed they
were an alien intelligence: not necessarily physical, but definitely not
terrestrial in the most literal sense. The nine participants each challenged
one entity, which communicated through them as a collective.
Puharich was
quite clear that these entities had a connection with ancient Egypt. In the
1970s, he chanced upon a young Israeli psychic, Uri Geller. During the many
scientific experiments Geller was put through as part as the CIAs
Remote
Viewing experiments, Puharich realized that Geller could contact The Nine,
and, specifically, that whereas in all previous attempts, he had required a
panel of nine people to participate, Geller could channel all nine together.
As Gellers fame rose, Puharich decided to write a biography of the exploits
of this remarkable psychic.
In the book, Puharich mentioned the Nine, but
for reasons that will forever remain obscure, he largely ridiculed The Nine,
even though for several decades before - and after - he would remain
obsessed with them. Equally, whereas previously he had spoken of them as an
alien intelligence, in the book, they had become an extraterrestrial
intelligence. There is a difference
Geller has always remained silent on what transpired with the Nine, as he
was unconscious throughout the channeling. When in contact with the Nine,
they summoned him to UFO fly-pasts and more.
Puharich claimed he made tape
recordings of these sessions, but none have ever been made public, so it
truly is a case of Puharich against the world.
If true, then Puharich asked,
"Are you behind the UFO sightings that started in the United States when
Kenneth Arnold saw nine flying saucers on June 24, 1947? to which they
answered yes.
Swiss psychologist Carl Jung made a detailed
study of UFOs (Flying Saucers - A Modem
Myth of Things Seen in the Sky - 1959) and
was convinced that they were an alien - though not extra-terrestrial -
intelligence that was here to help guide us into a new world, which he
identified with the cosmic Age of Aquarius.
According to Puharich, The Nine stated they were from
a world called Hoova,
though on occasion, they called themselves Rhombus 4D. They contacted
Puharich and Geller as they had been chosen to prevent war, as well as
steering the Earths fate into a specific direction, which the Nine argued
was indeed to their own needs and benefits, though it was also for the
benefit of Mankind.
Here, we therefore see clear parallels with the
methodology the Nine employed with the Maya, namely their directing the fate
of Mankind.
The Nine also claimed that they were responsible for Gellers
powers and that the way in which Mankind used Geller would determine whether
The Nines "programme for Planet Earth" would continue, or not.
Others, like Phyllis Schlemmer, have also contacted "Tom, who is a
spokesperson for the Nine, with whom Puharich spoke too.
Her story made it
into Stuart Holroyds "Briefing
for The Landing on Planet Earth" and the later "The Only Planet of Choice.
Other Nine contactees are Don Elkins and
Carla Rueckert, who channeled "Ra,
a member of The Nine, who declared that it
was he who had built the Great Pyramid. In sessions with Puharich, "Tom"
said the Sphinx was built and named after him.
Tom adds:
"I am the
beginning. I am the end. - wording that could be lifted from the baktun-ending
ceremonies.
I would personally not go as far as to argue that The Nine as per these
channellings are who they claim to be.
I have done extensive research into
them for more than a decade, and they are, quite simply, a complex issue
that defies easy categorization. But what can be said about them, is this:
it is clear that each culture, whether Mayan, Egyptian or 20th century
Western society, was and is in contact with an alien intelligence, which
each time, relates messages that are identical in context.
The number nine is prominent in another culture, which is believed to have
had direct links with the Maya: the
Hopi of Arizona.
They too believe we are
approaching the end of an era, though their doctrine does not stipulate a
precise date. Instead, they argue that for a New Era to be born, a series of
nine prophecies need to be fulfilled.
Still, according to Twylah Nitsch, her
grandfather Moses Shongo, the last of the traditional Seneca medicine men
who died in ca. 1925, did predict that there would be a 25 year of
purification that would end in ca. 2012.
Generally, the Hopi argue that it
is due "soon, as eight of the nine prophecies linked with it have been
fulfilled. The first "sign" occurred as far back as the 16th century, and
involved the arrival of the "white men with guns. The eight, incidentally,
were the Hippies!
The only prophecy remaining to be fulfilled, is that of
the
Blue Star Kachina, which is often interpreted as an alien, and sometimes
extra-terrestrial presence that will manifest itself on Earth.
As early as 1948, the Hopi tried to speak at the United Nations General
Assembly about their prophecies for our ending era. They feel that they are
the caretakers for the American continent and felt they needed to share the
message of the necessity for humans to be in balance with nature. Twice, the
Hopi elders were turned away, but they eventually were allowed to speak in
1976 at a United Nations-sponsored conference in British Columbia.
Like the Maya, the Hopi adhere to a cyclical world view and believe that we
are about to emerge from the Fourth into the Fifth World - out of a total of
seven worlds.
Even though the Hopi do not specifically state Nine Gods will
return, they do argue that one specific entity needs to return, which will
be the final sign that the Fourth World has ended. Kachinas are "spirits,
which are visualized during the Hopi religious dances, very much on par with
the masks the participants in the baktun ending ceremonies wore.
In 1914, a
song was first sung at the Wuwuchim ceremony, which marks the start of the
ceremonial calendar year in November.
The 1914 rendition of the song was the first
mention of the imminent "Emergence into the Fifth World" and stated that
this would occur when the Saquasohuh - the Blue Star Kachina - would dance
in the plaza.
The
Tortuguero Inscription,
mentioning the return of "The Nine"
According to the "Book of the Hopi, by
Frank
Waters, Saquasohuh,
"represents a blue star, far off and invisible, which
will make its appearance soon.
Others have referenced it as,
"You will hear
of a dwelling-place in the heavens, above the Earth, that shall fall with a
great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Very soon after this, the
ceremonies of my people will cease.
In recent years, there has been intense speculation as to what the Blue Star
could be.
Candidates included the
appearance of Hale Bopp in 1997, or the
supernova of SN1987A, which occurred on February 23, 1987. The latter was
the brightest supernova observed for four centuries.
It seems, however, that the Hopi prophecy has been ill-understood.
Simply
put, the prophecy clearly refers to a future tribal ceremony, at which point
a kachina - a Hopi spirit - known as Blue Star will reveal himself. As such,
Blue Star is nothing more or less than his name, and not necessarily linked
to a stellar phenomenon. He is, however, by all accounts a deity - an alien
intelligence that will return.
However, in recent years, the Hopi themselves have seriously clouded the
debate over what is supposed to happen. Some Hopi argue that our current
timeframe is known as the "Great Day of Purification.
Hopi elder Oh Shinnah
Fastwolf states this period will be over by 2011 and that it will be at that
moment that the blue star will appear in the sky.
Speaking Wind, the son of
a Pueblo shaman from New Mexico, has said that the Fifth World will start in
2012. He however argues that the final cleansing of the Earth began in 1998,
when in September, the five planets aligned.
He also saw a planetary
alignment of nine bodies on May 5, 2000, as very important, as it was the
begin date, until 2012, of how the earth would be purged.
"If mankind will
not willingly let go of the illusion, and the lie, it will be stripped
away.
And so, despite details and fringe claims, whenever we turn to the core of a
phenomenon and the core of the 2012 phenomenon, we are confronted with one
key message, one that even archaeologists have uncovered as being at the
root of the Mayan prophecy about 2012: it is about the return of the gods.
The Bolon Yokte Ku, who will signal in a new era.
The Time Returns!
