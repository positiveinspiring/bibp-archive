That men do not learn very much from
the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of
history.
Alduous Huxley
In its recent daylight plunder of the accounts of uninsured Cypriot (and
Russian) depositors and its ruthless steamrolling of all political and
social opposition in its way, the Troika (European Union, European Central
Bank, and International Monetary Fund) has displayed, for all to see, its
blatant disregard for personal property, democracy and the rule of law -
arguably the three cornerstones of modern European civilization.
Even the most blindly trusting and optimistic of Europeans are finally
beginning to see through the Troikas grandmotherly countenance to its
wolfish core.
By contrast, to many Latin Americans, the
international banking institutions lupine nature is all too familiar.
Through painful experience, they have learned that when the real men in
black come calling, bad things tend to happen.
During the lost decade of the 80s and the tumultuous first half of the 90s,
many Latin American economies, including the now rising global superpower
Brazil, were torn asunder and bled dry by a fatal cocktail of political
ineptitude and corruption, and financial fraud and abuse - all of it
facilitated and overseen
by the IMF, now one of the leading
protagonists in the Troikas asset-stripping pillage of Europe.
In 1994, decades of economic mismanagement reached their nadir in the
Mexican Tequila Crisis, an event which should have served - but patently
didnt - as a portent of the financial storms now buffeting Europe.
Act I
In the early nineties, Mexicos central bank adopted a low-interest-rate
regime that helped attract a surge of foreign speculative capital, primarily
from U.S. investors and banks.
The consequences were all too predictable: with cheap money flowing as
freely as bootlegged liquor at a Chicago speakeasy, the countrys banks -
like those in pre-crisis Spain, Portugal or Ireland - drastically eased
their lending standards.
In time-honored fashion, the financial press
applauded from the sidelines, dubbing the countrys spectacular debt-fuelled
growth the Mexican Miracle.
U.S. investors stampeded southward, drawn by Mexicos attractive interest
rates and bullish investment returns. This speculative rush created its own
momentum. The more investors shifted dollars south, the higher Mexican
stocks climbed and the easier it became for Mexican companies and their
government to borrow seemingly endless sums of dollars.
However, as with all easy-money-fuelled booms, the good times were short
lived. By 1992, strains were already beginning to show as Mexicos current
account deficit more than doubled in the space of just a few years. It took
just two more years for the bubble to pop, helped along by a confluence of
political and financial forces.
On Jan. 1, 1994, a group of Zapatistas led by el Subcommandante Marcos
launched a short-lived revolution in the countrys southern province of
Chiapas.
Added to that, the assassination, months later,
of two of the countrys most prominent political figures - then-President
Carlos Salinas anointed successor, Luis Donaldo Colosio, and Ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Secretary General José Franciso Ruíz
Massieu - began sowing serious doubts in investors minds as to the
countrys political stability.
Fears were also growing that Salinas government would devalue the currency
- which is precisely what his presidential successor Ernesto Zedillo
Ponce de León did on taking office in December of the same year.
With the country fast hemorrhaging foreign funds - many of which moved north
of the border to chase rising U.S. interest rates - Zedillo announced a 13
percent devaluation of the peso.
Over the following months, the free-floating
peso would lose almost 50 percent of its value against the dollar, wiping
out the savings of much of the countrys middle class and raising fears that
collapsing asset values would push Mexican banks over the edge.
Act II
So far, so normal - just another one of those sordid boom and bust tales to
which we have become so endured these days.
However, it was the events that directly
followed Mexicos fall from grace that stand out and which, in many ways,
paved the way to what is happening in Europe today.
Clearly panicked by the potential ramifications of the Tequila Crisis for
U.S. banks, the Clinton Administration quickly assembled a huge
package of funds, ostensibly to bail out the Mexican financial system. After
all, it was the least it could do to help its struggling neighbor.
The fact that Clintons then Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was also
a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, the vampire squid of recent lore,
which just so happened to have aggressively carved out a niche for itself in
emerging markets, especially Mexico, is obviously mere coincidence.
According to a 1995 edition of Multinational Monitor, Mexico was,
first and foremost among Goldman Sachs
emerging market clients since Rubin personally lobbied former Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to allow Goldman to handle the
privatization of Teléfonos de México.
Rubin got Goldman the contract to handle
this $2.3 billion global public offering in 1990. Goldman then handled
what was Mexicos largest initial public stock offering, that of the
massive private television company Grupo Televisa.
But it wasnt just the U.S. government that
seemed determined to lend a helping hand to Mexicos banks and, indirectly,
their all-important creditors.
The IMF also extended a package worth over
17 billion dollars - three and a half times bigger than its largest ever
loan to date. The Bank of International Settlements (BIS)
- the central bankers central bank - also got in on the act, chipping in an
additional 10 billion dollars.
With such vast sums flowing in and out of Mexico, one cant help but wonder
where the money went and who ended up having to pay for it. In answer to the
first question, Lawrence Kudlow, economics editor of the conservative
National Review magazine, asserted in sworn testimony to congress
that the beneficiaries were neither the Mexican peso or the Mexican economy:
It is a bailout of U.S. banks, brokerage
firms, pension funds and insurance companies who own short-term Mexican
debt, including roughly $16 billion of dollar-denominated tesobonos
and about $2.5 billion of peso-denominated Treasury bills (cetes).
So, just as happened with the bailouts of
Greece, Ireland and Portugal, money lent by the IMF and national governments
was speedily channeled via the recipient countrys government and struggling
banks to the coffers of some of the worlds largest private financial
institutions.
The money barely touched Mexican soil!
Financial institutions recouped all - or at least most - of the money they
had gambled on Mexico during the boom years. So began the modern era of no
risk, all gain moral hazard in global finance.
Yet although the Mexican bailout was, to all intents and purposes, a mere
balance sheet trick, by which funds were transferred from U.S. taxpayers to
U.S. banks and investors, via the Mexican financial system, the Mexican
people were still left on the hook for the resulting debt (plus, of course,
its compound interest).
After all, someone has to pay for the banks
generosity!
After unveiling a minimalist austerity plan in January that the markets
dismissed as insubstantial, the Zedillo administration imposed a shock plan
on March 9 that amounted to an all-out assault on Mexican businesses and
consumers (sound familiar, fellow Europeans?)
With the stroke of a pen, sales tax increased from 10 to 15 percent, fuel
prices by 33 percent and residential utility rates by 20 percent. The
government also limited minimum wage increases to 10 percent, which, set
against a backdrop of 50 percent inflation, inflicted a huge decline in the
buying power of minimum wage workers.
Government action also pushed interest rates on
consumer credit up to 125 percent.
Act III
Even today, 19 years on from the onset of the crisis, the country continues
to pay its pound of flesh for the toxic debt generated during the miracle
years.
According to recent estimates, between 1976 and
2000, the buying power of the countrys average minimum salary fell by a
staggering 74 percent, and has since risen by a pitiful 0.5 percent. As in
post-crisis Argentina, the countrys middle class has been decimated. And
what little remains of it is on the tab for the more than 3 billion dollars
of annual interest payments on the countrys debt.
For the big U.S. banks that helped fuel the Mexican miracle, the last 19
years have been somewhat kinder.
Following their recent takedown of the U.S.
economy in the sub-prime debacle, they are quite literally too big to fail
and have their sights set on much larger prey.
It seems, with the benefit of hindsight, that the Mexican Miracle and
Tequila Crisis were merely a test run for the end game now playing out
in Europe.
The question is:
will the Europeans play along?
