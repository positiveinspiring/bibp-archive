"Look," says Sergei Tchetvertnykh,
pointing at a flashing spreadsheet on his desktop's screen. "I just made
$82,000 in one second."
The co-CEO of the Toronto-based electronic
trading firm
Infinium Group isnt exaggerating.
A second is now a very long time in financial
markets, thanks to computer algorithms. Traders can gather and interpret
market data, and buy or sell securities in response, in milliseconds
(thousandths of a second) or even microseconds (millionths of a second).
Not every second is that successful, of course, and there can be many
reversals over a few hours. On a typical day, Infinium, with offices in
Toronto, San Francisco, London and Barbados, executes between 500,000 and
one million trades of stocks, options, currencies and other financial
instruments worldwide.
Measured by volume of shares, it is often the
largest single trader of major companies listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange - more active, in other words, than any of the otherwise dominant
investment dealers owned by Canadas Big Five banks.
The paradox is that Infinium is still very small and very young, with 70-odd
employees spread over its second-floor headquarters in a block of
19th-century buildings near Torontos historic St. Lawrence Market. (Its
other three offices account for another 40 staff.)
Tchetvertnykh and co-CEO Alan Grujic, who
are both 42, founded the firm in 2002. Unlike old-style investment dealers,
Infinium is a pure proprietary trading outfit - it trades only its own
money, none for clients.
As a specialist in high-frequency trading, Infinium is one of a handful of
cutting-edge firms in Canada, alongside dozens more based in the United
States and Europe, that have overwhelmed and revolutionized financial
markets over the past few years.
By some industry estimates, these hotshot
dealers - along with Goldman Sachs and some other established firms that
have also jumped into the high-frequency game - now account for about a
quarter of daily stock trading volume in Canada, and as much as 60% to 70%
south of the border.
Many of the strategies used by the high-frequency traders are traditional,
such as arbitrage, which takes advantage of price anomalies in different
markets. If, say, Barrick Gold is trading at $40.04 a share in Toronto and
$40.05 in New York (a huge price gap these days), the high-frequency firm
quickly buys in Toronto and sells in New York before the gap closes.
The
high-frequency traders speed and volume is
scaring the daylights out of many regulators and traditional investment
dealers, who think this new wave threatens to swamp the very foundations of
financial capitalism.
In November, Paul Myners, financial
services secretary to the U.K. Treasury Department, told an interviewer
that,
the danger is that nobody really seems to
think of themselves as owners.
How can management be accountable to investors
who change every few seconds?
Thomas Caldwell, CEO of Caldwell
Securities Ltd., a mid-sized Toronto dealer that has large investments in
the NYSE Euro-next and other stock-exchange holding companies around the
world, worries that,
a lot of trading these days is disconnected
from any economic reality or the fundamentals of companies.
Banks cannot compete with an
innovative, nimble company
Sergei Tchetvertnykh
High-frequency traders say that, far from
bringing on the apocalypse, what they are doing is very safe and useful.
If they buy and sell almost instantaneously at
virtually the same price, the risk of massive losses is tiny. Moreover, they
argue that huge benefits accrue to average investors in particular.
Theres more liquidity and tighter
spreads, says Grujic. How can that not be better?
More liquidity means anyone can get an order
filled almost immediately at the market price. (The spread is the formerly
wide gap between the high price traditional brokers would quote to clients
who wanted to buy a security, and the lower price they would offer to
investors who wanted to sell.)
People forget, argue Tchetvertnykh and Grujic, just how clubby and
antiquated stock and bond markets were as recently as the early 1990s, when
the two of them entered the business. In those days, the Toronto Stock
Exchange still had a trading floor, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
accounted for more than 80% of all trading in the United States.
Of course, even Tchetvertnykh and Grujic had little idea of what the future
of the markets would be when they got acquainted in 1992.
The meeting place was the CAMI automotive
factory in Ingersoll, Ontario. Grujic, who had graduated from the University
of Toronto in 1990 with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering, was
programming and monitoring robots on the plants assembly line.
However, hed decided to go to the University of
British Columbia for an MBA, and was helping management look for his
successor. One candidate was Tchetvertnykh, who had graduated from the Kiev
Polytechnic Institute with a degree in cybernetics in 1990, and had come to
Canada from Ukraine to enroll in the MBA program at the University of
Western Ontarios Richard Ivey School of Business.
The two hit it off right away. Both were academically brilliant sons of
European professionals.
Tchetvertnykhs father was a physicist and his
mother an accountant. Grujic was born in Toronto, but his parents were from
the former Yugoslavia - his father an electrical engineer who founded his
own consulting firm, and his mother a PhD in psychology. But the duo also
realized that finance, not the professions, was the place to make big money
in North America.
Tchetvertnykh graduated from Westerns Ivey School in 1994, and was offered
a job in corporate finance with Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
Grujic also graduated in 1994, but UBC wasnt on Wall Street recruiters
radar screen in those days, so he opted for a job in bond trading with TD
Securities.
They could hardly have picked a more propitious time to enter the securities
business. Markets around the world were on a roll and the tech boom was in
full swing; investment banks were experimenting with new mathematically
based trading strategies and starting to deal in more complex options and
derivatives.
Tchetvertnykh specialized in international mergers and acquisitions, which
inevitably meant a lot of travel. In 1997, he returned to Ukraine briefly to
head up Credit Suisses new investment banking division in Kiev, before
joining Bermuda-based Apollo Fund Management Ltd. in 1998 as director
of private equity.
In 2000, he jumped to Merrill Lynch, working
first in London, then moved back to Toronto in 2001 to establish a
technology group.
Grujic also landed plum international assignments. After training in bond
trading in Toronto, TD Securities posted him to London in 1998. The job gave
him the chance to trade more elaborate products, such as swaptions, which
are options that allow parties to exchange a fixed-interest rate security or
obligation for a variable-rate one.
Grujic and his colleagues also developed
computer models for bond pricing. Most bond trading was still done over the
phone in those days, but the models could instantly compare the price of,
say, a five-year bond with the prices at several different points on the
yield curve (from one to 30 years) and determine if the five-year bond was
rich or cheap.
Hobnobbing was an education, too.
You learn to have dinner with people whove
made a billion dollars, Grujic says.
In 2000, TD moved Grujic to Tokyo, where he
traded even more complex options and derivatives, essentially creating new
products.
As things turned out, 1998 was also a pivotal year for electronic trading.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light to online
electronic communication networks, also called alternative trading
systems (ATS),
to become full-fledged stock exchanges.
The enfranchisement of Instinet,
Island, Archipelago and Brut meant competition for the
NYSE - fast, technologically advanced competition that allowed just about
any sizable trader to place orders directly in the market, rather than route
them through investment dealers that held seats on the NYSE.
There are now dozens of electronic marketplaces
in the United States alone, and only about 25% of all American stock trading
is routed through the NYSE.
The other gut-wrenching change that opened the door even wider for a geek
invasion came in April, 2001, when North American stock exchanges completed
the switch from traditional fractional pricing to decimalized pricing. Under
fractional pricing, the smallest spread between the bid price on a stock
(the highest a buyer is offering to pay) and the ask price (the highest a
seller is willing to take) was one-16th of a dollar, or 6.25 cents.
Capturing the spread ($125 on even a small
retail order of 2,000 shares) had been a reliable source of profit for
traditional brokerage firms for decades, and for a mini-invasion of
individual day traders in the 1990s. But with decimalization, bid-ask
spreads shrank to less than a penny overnight.
Decimalization was a serendipitous development for Tchetvertnykh and Grujic.
Through all their early postings, the two men
had stayed in touch, and talked a lot about launching their own business
together someday. That someday came in 2001, when Merrill Lynch sold almost
all of its operations in Canada to CIBC. Tchetvertnykh didnt want to work
for a bank, and Grujic was getting restless in Tokyo.
As well, both men had recently married, and they
didnt want to raise families in hectic international financial capitals.
It was inevitable, so why put it off? says
Grujic of their collaboration.
Gaming, in the mathematical sense, is also
very much a part of high-frequency trading. Other traders, whether
theyre human beings or algorithms, often trade in patterns. Spot the
pattern, and you might be able to trade against them.
The duo still werent sure exactly what the
business would be, however.
At first they thought of opening a boutique
brokerage firm, like Toronto-based GMP Capital, but,
the proprietary-trading business model
became the most exciting, says Grujic.
Although the advent of wafer-thin spreads
knocked traditional brokerages for a loop, and wiped out day traders,
Tchetvertnykh and Grujic figured there were lucrative niches in the market
for new proprietary trading firms.
Banks cannot compete with an innovative,
nimble company, says Tchetvertnykh.
So, in 2002, he and Grujic founded Infinium with
$1 million of their own money.
Off-the-shelf computer hardware was readily
available. The hard part was writing the software from scratch - even for
two engineers with a decade of high-level experience in global markets.
First, there were automated trading strategies to consider. A lot of them
were based on traditional arbitrage between markets, as well as increasingly
sophisticated trend-based arbitrage - buying or selling if the price of a
security had drifted too far below or above a long-term or short-term trend
line. Theres also arbitrage between the prices of stocks and the prices of
futures, options, swaps, index funds and other derivatives that are based on
them, which may take a while to adjust when share prices move.
High-frequency traders have started to assume the role of the
traditional market makers as well. In the days of stock exchange trading
floors, market makers were individual traders designated by industry
regulatory organizations to provide liquidity and maintain an orderly market
in specified stocks - if trading sagged and buyers or sellers couldnt find
someone whod accept their order, the market maker was supposed to buy or
sell near the latest bid-or-ask prices.
In the modern variation,
exchanges and
ATSs charge so-called liquidity takers a
fee, and give liquidity providers a rebate.
In practice, that means that a high-frequency
firm might continuously offer to buy or sell a stock. If, say, a traditional
brokerage comes in and accepts that offer, it pays the fee. The fees and
rebates are tiny - say, 0.003 cents a share for liquidity takers and a
rebate of 0.002 cents per share to the liquidity provider (which means the
exchange covers its costs).
But if you collect rebates on a few million
shares a day, they do add up. The same goes for capturing bid-ask spreads,
which have been whittled down to fractions of a cent on major stocks, but
still can be realized.
Gaming, in the mathematical sense, is also very much a part of
high-frequency trading. Other traders, whether theyre human beings or
algorithms, often trade in patterns. Spot the pattern, and you might be able
to trade against them. Of course, everyone in the market is trying to do
that, which means continual updates to software are part of the game.
Infinium runs about a dozen broad strategies at
any given time.
Some might last a week, some might last a
year, says Tchetvertnykh. Our R&D budget is $3 million this year.
Before Infinium could get its systems running,
Tchetvertnykh and Grujic had to spend months programming in risk controls,
record-keeping functions and tests for compliance with regulations.
On any one trade, says Tchetvertnykh, there are
dozens of automatic checks within about 20 microseconds.
Speed is so essential that high-frequency trading firms and traditional
investment dealers have located computer servers a few feet away from stock
exchange trading platforms. Infinium has two servers: one near Alpha Trading
Systems Ltd.s platform in Toronto, and the other near a TSX platform in the
suburb of Markham (the exchange has another platform downtown). Transmission
time for an order: less than a millisecond.
Yet Tchetvertnykh says human control also remains a key component.
There are some patterns and anomalies that only
savvy traders who monitor the algorithms can spot. One Infinium trader in
Toronto who specializes in European stocks and currencies, watches 22
computer screens throughout her working day.
At the beginning, however, Infinium was basically just Tchetvertnykh and
Grujic and two other staffers. In 2003, the firms first full year of
operations, revenue totaled just $818,696. Because the U.S. market is so
much bigger and more advanced than Canadas, the duo figured they had to
expand the business there as soon as possible.
Infinium opened a U.S. subsidiary in 2005, and
Grujic moved to Marin County, north of Silicon Valley. Good call: Revenue
climbed to $13 million that year.
Tchetvertnykh says revenue for 2009 will likely reach $100 million.
Thats still small: The full-service investment
banking divisions of several Big Five Canadian banks each generate more than
$1 billion a year in revenue.
And privately owned Getco LLC, one of the
largest U.S. high-frequency trading firms, employs more than 200 traders,
and earned an estimated profit of $400 million (U.S.) in 2008.
When you listen to vested interests
complaining about something, it must be good.
Alan Grujic, co-CEO of Infinium Group
Grujic and Tchetvertnykh say Infiniums next
step is further geographic expansion.
The London office, which opened in 2008, gives
them a beachhead in Europe, and theyre looking at other countries around
the world. Yet they arent certain how big Infinium will get.
Grujic says that,
2,000 employees seems to be a natural place
we could go.
Tchetvertnykh says hed at least consider going
public.
It would give us equity to bring in the
best people.
Hed also consider selling out - he points out
that Citigroup paid $680 million (U.S.) for South Carolina-based Automated
Trading Desk LLC in 2007.
Meanwhile, regulators and traditional investment dealers are struggling to
assess what high-frequency traders have already done. At a conference in
late October, SEC chairman Mary Schapiro said that new rules may be needed,
to address new types of market
professionals whose activities may not be sufficiently regulated.
High-frequency traders argue that regulators
will first have to find problems, and so far, there dont appear to be any.
In a study of high-frequency trading in Canada published in September, New
York-based Investment Technology Group Inc. made the same argument as the
Infinium principals that their kind benefit the market: Bid-ask spreads and
share-price volatility in Canadian stock markets is down over the past two
years, and order depth - which measures share availability - is up.
Even bank-owned dealers agree with some of that. In October, CIBC published
a white paper by six of its senior traders on high-frequency trading and the
TSXs rebate program for electronic liquidity providers, which was
introduced in 2008.
Much of the impact has been obvious:
faster-moving quotes, more bids and offers,
more volume, and in some cases, frustration.
The CIBC traders also say they believe that
high-frequency traders,
are not predatory, simply very fast and
very good at what they do.
But critics like Thomas Caldwell say that
such overall numbers dont tell the whole story. They question whether
high-frequency traders are providing real liquidity to the market. In
fact, argues Caldwell, high-frequency traders are also removing it.
How? Large institutional investors know that if
they start trying to push through a large block of shares at a certain price
- even if the block is broken into many small trades on several ATSs and
markets - they can trigger a flood of high-frequency orders that immediately
move market prices to the institutions disadvantage. (This is the source of
the frustration mentioned in the paper by the CIBC traders.)
Thats why institutions have flocked to so-called dark pools operated by
ATSs such as Instinet, and individual dealers like Goldman Sachs. The pools
allow traders to offer prices without publicly revealing their identities
and tipping their hand. Caldwell says the best markets for all participants,
and for regulators, are,
central, open and transparent auction
markets, like the old stock exchanges.
But the dark pools mean that all the big orders
are now sitting somewhere else.
Risk is also a complex question. The high-frequency traders supercharged
computers havent blown up markets - yet - but Caldwell says they have blown
up individual stocks.
Exhibit A: the investment bank Bear Stearns,
which folded after its share price plummeted in March, 2008, even though
then-SEC chairman Christopher Cox assured the markets that the firm
was sound.
Bear Stearns did not commit suicide, says
Caldwell. It was murdered.
Gripes like Caldwells make Grujic chuckle a
bit.
When you listen to vested interests
complaining about something, it must be good.
