We can now reveal that the Syria chemical weapons narrative being
pushed by the White House is an outlandish hoax.
To understand why, you have to start with the story published in The
Independent entitled 'Revealed:
Government let British company export nerve gas chemicals to Syria.'
Sounds scary, right?
As The Independent reports:
The Government was accused of "breathtaking
laxity" in its arms controls last night after it emerged that officials
authorized the export to Syria of two chemicals capable of being used to
make a nerve agent such as sarin a year ago.
What, exactly, are those two dangerous chemicals
that need to be controlled via "arms control" regulations? You won't believe
me when I tell you.
They are:
You can see this yourself in the screen capture
of The Independent breaking news story.
Note the headline and the subhead.
The headline describes "nerve gas chemicals" and the subhead explains them
as "sodium fluoride" and "potassium fluoride."
Watch a video explaining all this:
U.S. water
fluoridation chemical is Syria's "chemical weapon"
If these chemical names sound familiar, that's because sodium fluoride is
the same toxic chemical that's routinely dumped into municipal water
supplies all across the USA under the guise of "water fluoridation."
In fact, the forced feeding of sodium fluoride to the U.S. population is
called a "public health" victory by the CDC, FDA and dentists everywhere.
Yet this same chemical, when sold to Syria, is openly and repeatedly
referred to as a "chemical weapon."
This is true across,
-
the BBC
-
the
Guardian
-
Daily Record
-
Sunday Mail
-
France24.com,
...and literally thousands
of other news websites.
According to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, any government "regime"
that uses chemical weapons against its own people should be bombed/invaded/overthrown by a coalition of other United Nations members.
By his own
definition, then, the United States of America should now be invaded by the
UN because the government uses a deadly chemical weapon - sodium fluoride - on its own people.
By implication, then, John Kerry is now calling for the UN to bomb the USA.
As the international media now confirms, sodium fluoride is a chemical
weapon, and this chemical weapon is used against the American people every
single day
in the water supply, a favorite attack vector for terrorists.
"Evidence" of chemical
weapons
...nothing more than hair samples of people who drank
sodium fluoride
As you might have guessed, Secretary of State John Kerry is running around
"pulling a George Bush" by claiming Syria has used weapons of mass
destruction on its own population.
Here's a sample of his claims:
"In the last 24 hours, we have learned through samples that were provided to
the United States that have now been tested from first responders in east
Damascus and hair samples and blood samples have tested positive for
signatures of sarin." Kerry said this on
NBC's Meet The Press.
But what, exactly, is he saying? That hair samples have tested positive for
"signatures" of sarin, not sarin itself.
What is a "signature" of sarin? The
fluorine element, which is of course the basis for sodium fluoride.
In other words, this "evidence" of chemical weapons in Syria may be nothing
more than a collection of hair samples taken from people who drank fluoride.
As this study
shows on SCIENCE.naturalnews.com, hair analysis is a
commonly-used practice for assessing exposure to fluoride.
It concludes,
"hair may be regarded as biomaterial of high
informative potential in evaluating prolonged exposure to fluorides..."
Typically, this analysis is conducted with ICP-MS instrumentation, using a
plasma torch that disintegrates all organic molecules, leaving only the
resulting elements (fluorine).
Tests done on Syrian citizens using ICP-MS
would not be able to distinguish between sodium fluoride and sarin exposure
in terms of the detection of elemental fluorine.
Read that again, because it's crucial to understanding the hoax being
perpetrated by the White House:
Tests on hair or other tissues, if done
using ICP-MS (the most common elemental analysis technology used today),
would not be able to distinguish between sodium fluoride and sarin.
Sarin has the chemical formula:
[(CH3)2CHO]CH3P(O)F
You will notice that the only elements in this
formula are:
-
Fluorine
-
Carbon
-
Hydrogen
-
Oxygen
-
Phosphorous
Out of those five elements, four of them
(carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorous) occur naturally in the human body in
large quantities.
Fluorine is the only element that strongly
stands out against the rest in terms of elemental analysis. And fluorine is
the same element that forms the basis of sodium fluoride.
Sarin can, of course, also be detected as a
complete molecule using liquid chromatography systems (HPLC), but this is
highly unlikely to have taken place given the inherent instability of the
molecule, which breaks apart upon exposure to simple moisture in the air or
in the body.
Thus, ICP-MS testing could be used to intentionally "blur" the evidence,
making sodium fluoride appear to be "signatures" of sarin, precisely as
Kerry is now claiming in the media.
As the whole point of all this is to
fabricate evidence to justify a political war in the first place, there
isn't any real scientific scrutiny being applied to all this.
Obama, Kerry and others are spouting whatever
they think the people will swallow, and since most of the U.S. public is
scientifically illiterate, it turns out they will swallow some real
whoppers.
Same sodium fluoride
chemical added to water for infants
As you can see, this sodium fluoride infant water - which the White House
effectively calls a "chemical weapon" - is sold at,
-
Wal-Mart
-
Walgreens
-
Albertson's
-
Safeway
-
K-Mart
-
Rite Aid
-
even at Toys "R" Us
Bet you never
knew you could buy chemical weapons at Toys "R" Us, did ya?
The Nursery Water label, shown below, lists "sodium fluoride" as a key
ingredient:
You'll also notice that the label includes instructions for using this
sodium fluoride baby water:
"...ready to mix with formula and cereal,
dilute juice or drink - just open and pour!"
Yep, you read it:
the same "chemical weapon" that's about to
start World War III is part of your baby's formula recipe. When sodium
fluoride is in the hands of Syria's Assad, it's called a "chemical
weapon," but when it's part of your baby's diet, it's called
"nutrition."
How's that for Orwellian doublespeak?
Syria's "chemical weapon"
also added to Colgate toothpaste
Just in case adding Syria's "chemical weapon" to baby water isn't enough for
you, it's also a key ingredient in Colgate toothpaste.
Yep, according to dentists, chemical weapons also "fight tooth decay," so
they should be added to toothpaste.
Check out the label on this Colgate
toothpaste and see for yourself:
Keep this in mind the next time you carry
toothpaste with you when you attempt to travel by air.
The TSA can pull you aside and legitimately
accuse you of working for the Assad regime as a chemical weapons terrorist
while charging you with the federal crime of "transporting chemical
weapons."
Mainstream media admits U.S.
food companies
...use chemical weapons against their own customers
Unless the mainstream media retracts all its thousands of stories about
sodium fluoride being a "chemical weapon" sold to Syria, it must come to
terms with the fact that it is also accusing the U.S. food industry of using
chemical weapons on consumers.
Sodium fluoride, after all, is added to countless consumer products, from
toothpaste and mouthwash to drinking water.
Sodium fluoride does not
magically change from a "chemical weapon" in Syria to a "nutritive mineral"
by crossing the ocean. Sodium fluoride is sodium fluoride, and it's
dangerous no matter who consumes it.
Keep this in mind the next time you hear a dentist recommending dumping
sodium fluoride into the local water supply.
You can correctly counter their absurd request
by threatening to call Homeland Security to report them as a terrorist for
engaging in the indiscriminate deployment of a chemical weapon in the water
supply - a favorite target for terrorists worldwide.
By the way, I'm not joking on this:
I actually encourage you to call
Homeland Security and report your local city council members as terrorists
who are mirroring the Assad "regime" in Syria by using sodium fluoride
"chemical weapons" on the public.
You might even call
the United Nations and ask
them to intervene in the USA's use of chemical weapons against its own
people... right?
-
Isn't that what John Kerry is asking the
world to do in the case of Syria?
-
Why does the USA have immunity from
using chemical weapons on its own people when Syria is threatened
with war for using the exact same chemical weapons on its
population?
Same "nerve gas
chemicals" exported to Syria
...are imported from China by nearly every U.S. city
By the way, the same sodium fluoride that was exported to Syria as a
"chemical weapon" is routinely imported by U.S. cities
to dump into the
municipal water supply.
They call it "water fluoridation" and dentists
push it like candy because it actually causes wildly increased tooth decay,
mottling and discoloration (all of which adds up to increased repeat
business for dentists).
As
previously documented, sodium fluoride is touted by China's
exporters as a multi-purpose chemical that functions as a deadly pesticide,
absorbs chemicals in the nuclear industry and more. See these two photos for
more proof.
These were created as marketing materials by
China's fluoride export industry:
From Alibaba.com:
Uses:
-
It's mainly used as a flux in the
aluminum smelting by fused-salt electrolysis;
-
also an opalizer in the manufacture of
enamel;
-
an opacifier and auxiliary solvent of
glass and enamel;
-
an insecticide of crops;
-
a flux in aluminum alloy casting; and in
the production of ferrous alloy and effervescing steel;
-
as well as a wear-resistant filler for
resin and rubber-boned abrasive wheels.
As said back in 2012, "Fluoride
is a chemical weapon!".
Now it turns out John Kerry agrees with me, and
he's using fluoride as an excuse to bomb a sovereign nation.
Quick question:
If Russia begins bombing the USA, can they
use the same excuse that Obama and Kerry are using on Syria?
"We had to save the American people from
the chemical weapons used by the Obama regime!"
