Food, Inc., lifts the veil on our nation's more... food industry,
exposing the highly mechanized underbelly that has been hidden from the
American consumer with the consent of our government's regulatory agencies,
USDA and
FDA.
Our nation's food supply is now controlled by a
handful of corporations that often put profit ahead of consumer health, the
livelihood of the American farmer, the safety of workers and our own
environment.
We have bigger-breasted chickens, the perfect
pork chop, herbicide-resistant soybean seeds, even tomatoes that won't go
bad, but we also have new strains of E. coli - the harmful bacteria that
causes illness for an estimated 73,000 Americans annually.
We are riddled with widespread obesity,
particularly among children, and an epidemic level of diabetes among adults.
