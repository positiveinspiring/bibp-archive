# How Privacy Became a Commodity for the Rich and Powerful

But our
digital dossiers extend well beyond the individual pieces of
information we know are online somewhere; they now include
stuff about us that can be surmised only through studying
our patterns of behavior.
The psychologist and data
scientist Michal Kosinski
has found that seemingly mundane
activity - like the brands and celebrities people "like" on Facebook
- can be leveraged to reliably predict, among other
things, intelligence, personality traits and politics.
After
our most recent presidential election, the company
Cambridge Analytica
boasted that its techniques were,
"instrumental in identifying supporters, persuading
undecided voters and driving turnout to the polls" on Donald
Trump's behalf.
All these little actions we think of as our
"private" business are actually data points that can be
aggregated and wielded to manipulate our world.
Years ago,
in 2009, the law professor Paul Ohm warned that the growing
dominance of Big Data could create a "database of ruin"
that would someday connect all people to compromising
information about their lives.
"In the
absence of intervention,"
he later wrote, "soon companies will know things about
us that we do not even know about ourselves."
Or as the
social scientist and Times contributor Zeynep Tufekci said
in a recent talk:
"People can't think like this: I
didn't disclose it, but it can be inferred about me."
When a
peeping Tom looks between the blinds, it's clear what has
been revealed.
But when a data firm cracks open our inboxes,
we may never find out what it has learned.
Privacy has not
always been seen as an asset.
The ancient
Greeks, for instance, distinguished between the public realm
("koinon") and the private realm ("idion").
In contrast
to those public citizens engaged in political life, humble
private citizens were known as "idiotai,"
a word that later evolved into "idiots."
Something similar
is true of the English word "privacy."
As Hannah Arendt
wrote in "The Human Condition," privacy was once closely
associated with,
"a state of being deprived of something, and
even of the highest and most human of man's capacities."
In
the 17th century, the word "private" arose as a more
politically correct replacement for "common," which had
taken on condescending overtones.
And yet
somewhere along the way, privacy was recast as a necessity
for cultivating the life of the mind.
In George Orwell's
"1984," the
proles are spared a life of constant
surveillance, while higher-ranking members of society are
exposed to
Big Brother's watchful eye.
The novel's
protagonist, Winston, begins to suspect that real freedom
lies in those unwatched slums:
"If there is hope," he writes
in his secret diary, "it lies in the proles."
In the
influential 1967 book "Privacy and Freedom,"
Alan Westin
described privacy as having four functions:
personal
autonomy, emotional release, self-evaluation and intimate
communication.
This modern understanding of privacy as an
intimate good grew up right alongside the technology that
threatened to violate it.
At the end
of the 18th century, the Fourth Amendment to
the United States Constitution protected Americans from
physical searches of their bodies and homes.
One hundred
years later, technological advancements had legal minds
thinking about a kind of mental privacy too:
In an
1890 paper called "The
Right to Privacy," Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis
cited "recent inventions and business methods" - including
instant photography and tabloid gossip - that they claimed
had "invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic
life."
They argued for what they called the right,
"to be let
alone," but also what they called "the right to one's
personality."
Now that
our privacy is worth something, every side of it is being
monetized.
We can either trade it for cheap services or
shell out cash to protect it. It is increasingly seen not as
a right but as a luxury good. When Congress recently voted
to allow
Internet service providers to sell user data
without users' explicit consent, talk emerged of premium
products that people could pay for to protect their browsing
habits from sale.
And if they couldn't afford it...?
As
one congressman told a concerned constituent,
"Nobody's
got to use the Internet."
Practically, though, everybody's
got to.
Tech companies have laid claim to the public square:
All of a sudden, we use
Facebook to support candidates,
organize protests and pose questions in debates.
We're
essentially paying a data tax for participating in
democracy.
The
smartphone is
an intimate device; we stare rapt into its bright light and
stroke its smooth glass to coax out information and connect
with others.
It seems designed to help us achieve Westin's
functions of privacy, to enable emotional release and
moments of passive reflection. We cradle it in bed, at
dinner, on the toilet. Its pop-up privacy policies are
annoying speed bumps in the otherwise instantaneous
conjuring of desires.
It feels like a private experience,
when really it is everything but...
How often have you
shielded the contents of your screen from a stranger on the
subway, or the partner next to you in bed, only to offer up
your secrets to the data firm tracking everything you do?
