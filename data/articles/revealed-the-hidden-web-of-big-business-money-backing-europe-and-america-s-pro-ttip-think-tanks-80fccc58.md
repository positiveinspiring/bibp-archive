Philippe de Backer, member of
the European Parliament, does not believe that funding threatens
independence.
"Sometimes they publish reports
that are against the interests of businesses," he argues. "CEPS
recruits the cream of the crop. They really aren't about to
put their reputation on the line just like that."
That's too simplistic, in Ferdi
de Ville's opinion.
"I don't think that each of
their studies is being scrutinized, but I do think that they
are aware that they cannot pursue a line that is in conflict
with the corporate interests of those who are funding them.
Don't bite the hand that feeds
you."
And there are plenty of crumbs to go
around, for business people and policymakers alike.
There are enough options for early
risers too. CEPS offers member businesses the "unique
opportunity" to exchange ideas with senior officials during a
corporate breakfast in an informal setting.
On two occasions and under the
watchful eye of the director, CEPS's corporate members ate
croissants with former trade commissioner Karel de Gucht,
Cecilia Malmstr√∂m's predecessor.
In the U.S., meanwhile,
Damon Wilson the invitation
obtained under the Dutch freedom of information act, the
executive vice-president of the Atlantic Council, invited
Michael Froman, the American head negotiator, to a dinner on
the occasion of the Atlantic Council's annual Distinguished
Leadership Awards.
Documents that we obtained after appealing to the EU freedom of
information act showed that the Atlantic Council and Michael
Froman's office were quite intimate with each other.
When the Atlantic Council compiled a
report on the benefits of TTIP for small and medium-sized
businesses, they wanted Froman to attend the presentation.
His assistant, fondly referred to as
Becca, The email exchange between Garrett Workman and
Becca asked whether representatives from the business community
will be present.
"We're inviting a few of the
small businesses, yes," replied Garrett Workman of the
Atlantic Council, "but have to figure out how we're paying
for them to come. Working on that with FedEx."
