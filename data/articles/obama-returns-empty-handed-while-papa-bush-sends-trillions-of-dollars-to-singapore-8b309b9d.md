President Obamas 10-day Asian begging tour
produced nothing as governments of the world refused to provide any more
life-support to the USs corporate government.
George Bush Senior,
meanwhile, used Obamas absence as an opportunity to fly trillions of
dollars worth of financial instruments and gold to Singapore. This money
will be spent on a shopping spree of some sort designed to strengthen the
Nazi branch of the US
Secret Government, according to CIA, MI6 and Asian
sources.
Multiple sources also report the
Khazarians are
planning something truly awful, including perhaps the mass murder and
expulsion of Muslims from Europe. Viscount Ettiene Davignon, Chairman of the
Bilderberg Group promised to hold a press conference as soon as the smoke
clears.
The G20 summit meeting in Korea last week could have been better described
as the G19 bashing the US.
Obama is considered by other world leaders to be
a lightweight intellect with no real power. As mentioned above, Obamas
efforts to beg, steal or borrow money from other countries has been firmly
rejected, meaning there is little chance the US corporate government will be
able to meet a January 30th payments deadline.
When Chinese President Hu Jintao visits the US
in late January, he will no doubt set some very tough conditions if the
corporate government is to be allowed to exist beyond that date.
The White Dragon society has pointed out to the
Pentagon and to other sources that the US corporate governments debts are
not the debts of the US peoples and that bankrupting the US corporate
government would be a better choice for Americans than accepting hundreds of
years of debt slavery.
The Chinese also rattled the US military establishment in multiple ways last
week.
-
They used
Electrical Magnetic Pulse weapons to disable a US missile
carrier that was planning to attack Iran.
-
The Chinese also launched two
intercontinental ballistic missiles, one off the coast of Los Angeles and
the other off the coast of New York to demonstrate their ability to bring
power to bear on the continental United States.
The story being put out that Pleiadian aliens
stopped the missiles is disinformation designed to cover up the embarrassing
Chinese military coup.
The Chinese also once again demonstrated that US
aircraft carrier fleets are obsolete by having a submarine surface,
undetected, right behind a US carrier during a military exercise.
The Nazis, for their part, informed the
White Dragon society that they were
a power to be reckoned with. A Pentagon Nazi source said that during the
Falklands war with Argentina the Nazis stole two British warships and fooled
the British into thinking they had been sunk.
It was also the Nazis who sank the
Russian
submarine Kursk and stole its 42 nuclear missiles. In addition to their
underground bases in the US, South America and
Antarctica, the source says
the Nazis have a major underground installation in Papua New Guinea as well
as multiple underwater bases.
This group wants to negotiate their own separate
deal with the White Dragon Society and their allies.
A KGB source was contacted by a different group warning that
a nuclear bomb
has been hidden somewhere in Tokyo and is no longer in the basement of the
Korean Residents Association. The source of this nuclear blackmail is the
Federal Reserve Board faction.
The Khazarian Satanists have also begun to issue dire warnings of their
plans. They have been hiring Mexican and Philippino police officers to
arrest and imprison American citizens after anticipated riots in response to
the bankruptcy of the US Corporation and a subsequent attempt to form the
American
Union by merging Canada and Mexico with the US, according to a
senior CIA source.
This same source mentioned the plan to attack
Muslims in Europe and elsewhere.
Signs of a split between mainstream Jews and Khazarian Satanists have also
begun to emerge in the US.
The bashing of Obama in the US press is also
expected to intensify and ultimately result in,
As these tales illustrate, the power structure in the US and Europe is
becoming increasingly splintered and it is becoming hard to track all the
competing factions.
However, it is clear the European Bilderberg group and
Europe have split with the Federal Reserve Board and the US corporate
government.
Davignon offered to finance the $1 trillion
lawsuit being prepared against
Daniel Dal Bosco, the Davos World Forum and
the United Nations.
The White Dragon Society refused the offer
because it wishes to remain neutral and said the lawsuit will go ahead only
when the lawyers are certain they have an overwhelming case.
However, Bilderberg has agreed to provide the White Dragon Society with information
about the UN such as who exactly gave it its license.
The Federal Reserve Board and their Wall Street buddies, for their part are
renewing financial warfare against Europe and the Euro by targeting Ireland
and the Baltic States. The Europeans are now actively increasing their gold
stocks in order to counter this latest offensive.
In Japan meanwhile, a purge of the Financial bureaucracy and the banking
system is continuing. The aim is to make Japan once again an independent
country for the first time since 1858, according to a senior Black Dragon
Society source.
The Japanese political system will remain
incoherent and deadlocked until the purge of foreign controlled stooges is
complete, he said.
All in all, chaos is expected to intensify in coming weeks as the old order
falls apart and the purge of the criminals who infested the
global financial
system concludes.
