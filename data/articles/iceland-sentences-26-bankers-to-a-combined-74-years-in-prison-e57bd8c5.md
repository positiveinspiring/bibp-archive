In a move that would make many
capitalists' head explode if it ever happened here,
Iceland just sentenced
their 26th banker to prison for
their part in
the 2008 financial collapse.
In two separate Icelandic
Supreme Court and Reykjavik District Court rulings, five top
bankers from Landsbankinn and
Kaupping - the two largest banks in the country - were
found guilty of market manipulation, embezzlement, and
breach of fiduciary duties.
Most of those convicted have
been sentenced to prison for two to five years.
The maximum
penalty for financial crimes in Iceland is six years,
although their Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments
to consider expanding sentences beyond the six year maximum.
After the crash in 2008, while
congress was giving American banks a $700 billion
TARP bailout courtesy of taxpayers, Iceland decided to
go in a different direction and enabled their government
with financial supervisory authority to take control of the
banks as the chaos resulting from the crash unraveled.
Back in 2001, Iceland
deregulated their financial sector, following in the path of
former President
Bill Clinton. In less than a decade,
Iceland was bogged down in so much foreign debt they
couldn't refinance it before the system crashed.
Almost eight years later, the
government of Iceland is still prosecuting and jailing those
responsible for the market manipulation that crippled their
economy.
Even now, Iceland is still paying back loans
to the
IMF and other countries which were needed just to keep the
country operating.
When Iceland's President,
Olafur Ragnar Grimmson was asked how the country managed
to recover from the global financial disaster, he
famously replied,
"We were wise enough not to
follow the traditional prevailing orthodoxies of the
Western financial world in the last 30 years.
We
introduced currency controls, we let the banks fail, we
provided support for the poor, and we didn't introduce
austerity measures like you're seeing in Europe."
Meanwhile, in America, not one
single banking executive has been charged with a crime
related to the 2008 crash and U.S. banks are raking in
more than $160 billion in annual profits with little to
no regulation in place to avoid another financial
catastrophe.
