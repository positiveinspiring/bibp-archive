Fallon's resignation is frightening. President
Bush and his administration
are totally out of control and it is a bad sign for Fallon to resign given
the context.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates did not have to accept Admiral Fallon's
resignation.
"The military people think basically that Admiral Fallon was
PUSHED OUT"
- Mark Thompson Time Magazine National Security Correspondent
Fallon is described as,
"the one person in the military or Pentagon standing
between the White House and war with Iran."

Fallon 'May Lose
Job Over Iran War'

Admiral William Fallon, the head of the US Central Command, may
lose his job for opposing President Bush's plans to wage war against Iran.
According to a new Esquire article by Thomas Barnett, Admiral Fallon
may be prematurely 'relieved of his command' as soon as this summer to be
replaced with a more 'pliable' commander.
"If that were to happen, it may well mean
that the president and vice-president intend to take military action
against Iran before the end of this year and don't want a commander
standing in their way," says the article which will be published on
March 12.
Admiral Fallon, who has been named as 'one of
the best strategic thinkers in uniform today' by Defense Secretary Robert
Gates, opposed the troops surge in Iraq and has consistently battled
with President George W. Bush to avert confrontation with Iran.
The Navy admiral has vowed that an attack on Iran would 'not happen on his
watch', calling the White House warmongering echelons 'not helpful'.
Washington and its allies are at loggerheads with the Islamic Republic over
the country's nuclear standoff with the West.
The Bush administration accuses Iran of pursuing nuclear weaponry, while
Tehran maintains its uranium enrichment will only provide fuel for the
country's under-construction nuclear power plants.
President Bush insists the military option against Iran remains on the
table, while his top military experts, including Admiral Fallon, urge the
White House to choose a diplomatic approach towards Tehran.
In a Thursday White House press briefing, spokeswoman Dana Perino was
asked about the Esquire piece and refused to confirm whether Fallon's
position is secure until the end of his tenure.
