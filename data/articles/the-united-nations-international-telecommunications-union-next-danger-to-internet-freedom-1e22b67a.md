In a few months, Dubai, India will be the stage for
a potential firestorm
with the internet at the center.
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is an extension of the
United Nations (UN) that has the control over the internet in
mind. What the UN would like to do to the internet makes SOPA and PIPA seem
like harmless legislation.
Both parties of the UN Congress met and agreed to
resist the attempt of the
UN to usurp the web,
with everything [they] have.
Member of the Commerce, Manufacturing and
Trade Subcommittee (CMTS) released a
resolution that admonished the Us
government to take a stance on global governance that,
clearly articulates the consistent and
unequivocal policy of the United States to promote a global Internet
free from government control and preserve and advance the successful
multi-stakeholder model that governs the Internet today.
Fred Upton, member of the CMTS
said:
The Internet has become this economic and
social juggernaut not because governmental actors willed it to be so,
but because the government took a step back and let the private sector
drive its evolution.
International regulatory intrusion into the
Internet would have disastrous results not just for the United States,
but for people around the world.
Seems that when controlling the internet is not
coming from the Big Brother usurpers within the US government, Capitol Hill
gets
a bit concerned.
For quite some time now, the House and the
Senate have been promoting SOPA and PIPA that would give law makers untold
power over internet service providers (ISPs) and copyright protection that
could shut down any website on an assertion (regardless of the evidence to
prove it).
Not to mention the
abolishment of the 1st
Amendment on the web with over-reaching Orwellian restriction.
The UNs ITU proclaims that because the internet is a global entity that
the UN should have jurisdiction over it, manage its abilities according to
global UN standards and engage restrictions that could be installed at the
fundamental level of the internet to prevent any infractions of
international mandates.
The
the
United Nations wants to include the domain-name system along with the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is currently a
privately owned US non-profit organization.
Hamadoun Toure, the ITU secretary-general,
stated that:
When an invention becomes used by billions
across the world, it no longer remains the sole property of one nation,
however powerful that nation might be.
ICANN operates now as a multi-stakeholder that
involves groups like the Internet Engineering task Force and the World Wide
Web Consortium.
Despite critics and alleged conflicts of
interest, the expansion of top-level domains, this action is a sort of
land
grab for domain names.
Vinton Cerf, TCP/IP developer and Chief Internet Evangelist at
Google, spoke before a congressional subcommittee where he
stated that
giving the UN power of control over the internet would subject the internet
to the decisive ideals of an international body who has no intention of
preserving the free flow of information.
This action would
end free speech
on the internet.
Cerf said:
Such a move holds profound - and I believe
potentially hazardous - implications for the future of the Internet and
all of its users. If all of us do not pay attention to what is going on,
users worldwide will be at risk of losing the open and free Internet
that has brought so much to so many.
It is expected that the ITU would begin a sort
of taxation that international telecommunications corporations would be
expected to pay for the ITUs handling of web traffic as it flows across the
world.
ITU members would be privy to the
new found cash
flow that would be in the hands of international governance; which could
begin to line the pockets of the UN in record time.
In the Wall Street Journal, Robert McDowell spoke about the egregious
countries who belong to the ITU and the
restraint of freedom that will
surely follow if the UN is allowed to govern the internet.
McDowell wrote:
[L]ets face it, strong-arm regimes are
threatened by popular outcries for political freedom that are empowered
by unfettered Internet connectivity. They have formed impressive
coalitions, and their efforts have progressed significantly.
Groups like the Internet Society and the
Center for Democracy and Technology have submitted many petitions via
internet that bring attention to the UNs agenda to seize control over the
web.
AccessNow
urges the,
release your preparatory documents;
recognize the role of the user, and reject any proposals that might
centralize control of the internet.
The UN and the ITU are powerful international
agencies whose interests over the internet are far
more controlling than
SOPA and PIPA were ever meant to be.
Without action taken now, in December of this year, the internet as we know
it will disappear not long after the meeting in Dubai, India.
