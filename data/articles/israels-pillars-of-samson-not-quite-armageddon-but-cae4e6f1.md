As the US edges toward an unprovoked and utterly needless war with Iran,
some remarks by an eminent and experienced observer of that part of the
world caught my attention.
First, he
noted that,
Israel and the US realize
that the next war will burn much of the Middle East and may well spell the
end of Israel.
Now, Israel certainly believes that about the Middle East, and in fact hopes
it happens, because that just makes its position stronger.
But neither
Israel nor the US - at least at a governmental level - accept the second
part of the proposition, just the opposite, that in fact it will be the
saving of Israel - because (as Ive noted elsewhere) if the regional chaos
is great enough, Israel will take the opportunity to ethnically cleanse all
Palestinians (and probably Israeli Arabs as well) from Greater Israel by
shoving them over its borders, into Jordan and the Sinai (and some into the
Lebanon as well).
That will leave it intact and Jewish, its neighbors
overwhelmed by a few million destitute Palestinians - a 2nd and even worse Nakba
- and everyone else in ruins or teetering on the edge.
Netanyahu, Barak, Lieberman and their merry thugs wont shed a tear or lose a seconds
sleep over any of it, much less over the many Americans who will die in yet
another of Americas Jewish Wars.
Second, he
remarked that,
Every week Israel becomes weaker vis a vis the
resistance axis and at what point does Israel decide to bring down the
house and start again if it can survive with enough military power (backed
by the US) to remake the region.
But I simply dont see Israel getting weaker, just more beleaguered, which
is not the same thing.
We need to keep in mind that Israel defines its
usable power (and therefore its security) not only in terms of what it has,
but also what it can command from its most favored goyim in the US
- and
that, now, is virtually everything. We know about Israels control of the
Congress and
the media, and I think people on our side generally understand
about their control of political appointments that absolutely keep opponents
of Israel out of office - the Chas Freeman incident ought to have been
telling.
The American public, unfortunately, is almost absolutely clueless
about the whole enterprise, thanks to the prevailing dominant theme they get
from the President, national politicians, the press and mostly the
Protestant pulpit.
Yet it goes beyond that.
The fate of White House correspondent
Helen Thomas
and 20-year CNN editor
Octavia Nasr has sent a signal to absolutely every
journalist in the print and electronic media that any attempt to cross even
slightly Israels line (which is what Nasr did), much less question Israels
basic premise (as Thomas did), means total and almost instantaneous
professional ruin.
If senior people like them can be chopped in hours, what
chance does a rising younger journalist have? None at all.
This is along the
lines of the old French saying (I translate roughly),
Shoot a few to
encourage the others, in this case encourage them to behave or at least to
keep silent and not misbehave (as AIPAC and company define misbehavior).
So
the American public will continue to hear, see and read just what Israel
wants, barring a small if growing number who do get at least some of their
news from the internet.
Sadly, it is mostly the same for the US military now as well.
The sequential
sacking on overlapping grounds of Admiral William Fallon, Admiral (ret.)
Dennis Blair and General Stanley McChrystal (and the concurrent enhancement
of Admiral Michael Mullen and General David Petraeus) has sent the same
signal to the professional military, and not just the generals and admirals.
Question official policy (Fallon), do not conform to Administration (i.e.,
Israeli) priorities (Blair and Fallon), or speak openly (however unwisely)
what almost all professional military here feel about this hapless
commander-in-chief and his Zionist amateurs in the White House (McChrystal),
and your careers are done, no matter how distinguished they might have been.
So behave - and almost all will, knowing absolutely now that theyll have no
effective support from the generals and admirals if they dont.
Besides, putting lots of discrete pieces together, including published
information on Israeli penetration of the telecommunications security and
cybernetic systems in the US since the 70s and 80s, the movement of
Israelis (with or without dual nationality) or American Jews serving Israel
across the US and Israeli governments and lobbies like
AIPAC, and the
presence of Israelis (again with or without dual nationality) and American
Jews serving Israel throughout the US national security apparatus for
decades (remember the far-from-unique stories of
Lani Kass or
David Wurmser,
much less the likes of Scooter Libby or Rahm Emanuel?), one thing seems
painfully clear to me.
This is that Israel has had ongoing access for
decades to US nuclear codes and systems, and may well be able to override
safeguards here to obtain command and control (and therefore targeting and
launch capabilities) over at least US land-based strategic nuclear systems.
Think about it...
With those technical means, oversight of security and
especially in-place human assets, Israel would have had to make a deliberate
decision NOT to acquire that access and obtain those capabilities in order
not to have them now, and that flies in the face of everything else Israel
has done in its national security and espionage fields.
That may be the club
Israel holds over US presidents, and it would certainly explain a host of
otherwise inexplicable actions by them.
Understanding the actual dynamics of
this phenomenon and how to counter them must have the highest priority.
