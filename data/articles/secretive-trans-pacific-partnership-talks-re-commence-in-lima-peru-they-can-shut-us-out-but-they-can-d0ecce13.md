Today, trade negotiators
from 11 countries meet again to secretively draft the
terms of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP).
The TPP is a sprawling
multinational trade agreement that includes expansive
and unfair copyright provisions. If signed, the TPP will
entrench these digital enforcement measures as a global
standard, leading to harsh regulations that would be
disastrous for Internet users worldwide.
EFF is on the ground in
Lima, Peru for the 17th round of negotiations.
As with
all the previous TPP talks, the public is completely
excluded from the process. We're here to educate and
call attention to this secretive agreement until they
make these negotiations transparent and democratic. As
long as they continue to shut out digital rights groups,
it will be impossible for them design pragmatic
innovation policy that addresses our users' concerns.
As during
the ACTA
negotiations, Hollywood and other Big Content industries
have a stronghold over international policymakers.
As a
result, U.S. trade delegates are pushing forth
provisions that, if enforced, would have huge chilling
effects on everyone including,
These provisions are
designed to limit how anyone can share and interact with
digital content so they will impact everyone.

Figure Out How They Can Control
The Internet

Remember SOPA? Remember how
when we the people finally defeated SOPA everyone got so
stoked that confetti poured out of their eyeballs and
its opponents downloaded films and albums and pirated
video games in celebration?
Well, shortly after SOPA
there was CISPA - the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and
Protection Act - a bill that is
both scarier than Zombies and much less well known than
SOPA.
On April 18, three days
after the Boston Marathon bombing, CISPA passed in the
House of Representatives. Obamas White House has
expressed fundamental
concerns about CISPA. They are justifiably a bit
turned off by how CISPA doesnt specify precisely how it
intends to spy on the internet - and when it is ok to
spy on internet users - and that is a terrifying
prospect.
As a Canadian, these
American fuck up the internet bills have always been
disconcerting.
While Canadian sovereignty would ideally
save anyone who lives in this country and errs on the
wrong side of a SOPA or a CISPA - with so much internet
traffic filtering through American-owned web servers -
it is not out of the question that American jurisdiction
could be called against an international cyber-offender.
The state of Virginia, for example,
claimed jurisdiction against the Hong Kong-owned
Megaupload who was hosting their website in that
state.
But now it appears that its
going to be even easier for international copyright
offenders to be tried in court by the interests - and
lobbying power - of Hollywood.
Starting today, 11
countries - Canada, America, Mexico, Peru, Chile,
Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, Brunei, Malaysia, Australia,
and New Zealand - are
having a secret (no members of the public and no press)
meeting in Lima, Peru to figure out what can be done
about copyright offenders who transmit Hollywoods
precious content over the interwebs tubes without
paying for it.
The meeting is held under
the banner of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
Agreement. Theyre looking to sign an international
treaty that will create world government-esque laws to
handle anyone who downloads an early leak of Iron
Man 3 illegally.
The Electronic Frontier
Foundation is calling this the,
biggest global threat to
the internet since ACTA.
If you remember, ACTA (the
Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) is an
international, internet-policing treaty that was
shut down by
the European Parliament with a 92 percent nay vote.
Luckily for Europeans, no EU country is anywhere near
the TPP negotiations in Peru right now - and
European politicians are now quick to distance
themselves from the policies that ACTA is trying to
ram down the world's throat.
But in North America, the
ACTA movement is still very much alive.
Prime Minister
Stephen Harpers government
passed a bill in March that makes Canada more ACTA-friendly
by allowing customs officers to destroy counterfeit
goods and ratcheting up the criminal penalties against
copyright offenders.
And the United States has seized
hip-hop blog domains without warning or trial,
because they were alleged to host pirated material.
A leaked chapter
outlining some preliminary discussion to re-examine
intellectual property has revealed that TPP wants to add
further checks and balances to restrict fair use.
Those
behind TPP want to make sure that if a teacher is trying
to show some copyrighted material in their class for the
purpose of education, or if a humorist using copyrighted
material in an article for the purpose of satire,
theyre doing so under what TPP calls a good faith
activity.
The language in this leaked
TPP chapter is incredibly dense and dates back to
February 2011 - so not only is it a confusing bit of
writing, but it will also likely be revised over and
over during this meeting in Peru.
As it stands, the EFF is
worried (click image right) that,
the
United States is trying to export the worst parts of its
intellectual property law without bringing any of the
[fair use] protections.
And just like SOPA or CISPA,
many people are concerned that the broad language in new
legal terms like good faith activity will potentially
lead to unjust prosecutions.
It may take a while before
the results of this TPP meeting in Peru filter out to
the press, but its crystal clear that even though SOPA
died, the Hollywood lobby is more than willing to
generate new legislation and international partnerships
to protect its interests.
SOPA, for a combination of
reasons, incited the ire of the public. We saw SOPA
blackouts where websites like Reddit and Wikipedia went
offline for a day, celebrities spoke out against it on
Twitter; there was a bona fide cultural movement.
But now, the language behind
international efforts like ACTA or TPP is getting more
and more obscure, the reporting on such efforts less and
less frequent, and the meetings being held to define
these treaties are being held behind closed doors.
The wheels of government are
moving quickly to restrict international copyright
online as much as possible - with the lobby of Hollywood
thrusting it forward - in order to preserve the profits
of content gatekeepers like the RIAA and MPAA.
