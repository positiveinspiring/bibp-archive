Several years ago I conducted a Gospel meeting in Toccoa, Georgia. While I was there I decided to check on a rumor I had heard about a mammoth granite monument that supposedly had been erected in the nearby town of Elberton in March 1980.
The New Age Movement
According to the rumor, the monument had been paid for by a mysterious group affiliated with the New Age Movement, an international amalgamation of Humanist societies whose aim is to prepare the way for the coming of "Lord Maitreya," a Messiah who will save the world. The guiding force behind the movement is the Lucis Trust located at the United Nations Plaza in New York.
The movement has been well documented in Constance Cumbys book "The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow." This is the same group that ran full page ads in all the leading U.S. newspapers in the spring of 1982 announcing "the Christ is now here" and will soon reveal himself.
The group also runs ads in magazines promoting a special Humanist prayer.
The New Age Monument
I was able to confirm that the remarkable monument truly does exist. It is located on the highest point in Elbert County, about seven miles outside the town of Elberton, Ga.
It is 20 feet high, taller than the monoliths of Stonehenge in England. It consists of 951 cubic feet of granite which weighs an estimated 245,000 pounds. The center stone and capstone contain slits and holes that are designed to provide astronomical observations of the sun, moon and stars. These are patterned after similar ancient pagan shrines in Europe. The monument is dedicated to an "Age of Reason."
The statement, "Let these be Guidestones to an Age of Reason" is carved on each side of the capstone in four dead languages: Sanskrit, Egyptian Hieroglyphics, Babylonian Cuneiform, and Classical Greek. The four major granite slabs that radiate out from the central stone contain the ten commandments of the New Age of Reason.
The commandments are presented in the eight languages which are spoken by two-thirds of Mankind: English, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Hindi, Chinese, Spanish, and Swahili.
The New Age Commandments
The ten commandments are as follows:
Maintain humanity under five hundred million in perpetual balance with nature Guide reproduction wisely, improving fitness and diversity Unite humanity with a living new language Rule passion, faith, tradition, and all things with tempered reason Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts Let all nations rule internally, resolving external disputes in a world court Avoid petty laws an useless officials Balance personal rights with social duties Prize truth, beauty, love...seeking harmony with the infinite Be not a cancer on earth...leave room for nature...

The Finances
The project was financed by a mysterious man who identified himself only as "Mr. R. C. Christian." He admitted that was not his real name, but he refused to reveal his true identity to anyone except the president of the local bank in Elberton. He stated that he represented "a small group of loyal Americans who believe in God." He said they lived outside of Georgia and simply wished to "leave a message for future generations." He claimed the group had planned the project for more than 20 years.
Despite intensive investigations by many news agencies, the identity of R. C. Christian and his group has remained a secret to this day.
Analysis
Based on my study of the New Age Movement, I have no doubt that the Georgia Guidestones are an expression of the basic philosophy of that movement. Since Satan is using that movement to herald the emergence of a universal False Messiah, I can only conclude that the Georgia Guidestones may well contain the ten commandments of the Anti-Christ. Look at how ominous the very first commandment is:
"Maintain humanity under five hundred million in perpetual balance with nature."
There are 5 billion people on the earth today.
To implement this first commandment, 4.5 billion people will have to be eliminated!
Commandment 4 makes it clear that all true Christians would be a clear target of any elimination program, because Christians give primacy to faith. Commandment 2 is an expression of the Nazi concept of controlled reproduction of the species. Commandments 2, 5, 7 & 8 are the cornerstones of centralized, world government. Commandment 9 is an expression of the essence of most oriental, mystical religions.

Further Evidence
Lest there be any doubt left as to the motivation of "R. C. Christian" and his group, consider the following quotation taken from a philosophical document which the group sent to the builder of the monument.
"It is very probable that humanity now possesses the knowledge needed to establish an effective world government. In some way that knowledge must be widely seeded in the consciousness of all mankind. Very soon the hearts of our human family must be touched and warmed so we will welcome a global rule of reason."
Note the exaltation of human reason and the emphasis on world government as the only hope for Man. The document refers to the monument as,
"a cluster of graven stones whose purpose is "to convey our ideas across time to other human beings . . . We hope they [the commandments] will merit increasing acceptance and that through their silent persistence they will hasten in a small degree the coming Age of Reason."
From The Giorgian Guidestones Website
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind.
-- Thomas Paine Persecution is not an original feature in any religion; but it is always the strongly marked feature of all religions established by law.
-- Thomas Paine Question with boldness even the existence of God; because if there be one, He must approve the homage of Reason rather than that of blindfolded Fear.
-- Thomas Jefferson It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are 20 gods, or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.
-- Thomas Jefferson Christianity... (has become) the most perverted system that ever shone on man.... Rogueries, absurdities and untruths were perpetrated upon the teachings of Jesus by a large band of dupes and importers led by Paul, the first great corrupter of the teaching of Jesus.
-- Thomas Jefferson The clergy converted the simple teachings of Jesus into an engine for enslaving mankind and adulterated by artificial constructions into a contrivance to filch wealth and power to themselves... these clergy, in fact, constitute the real Anti-Christ.
-- Thomas Edison I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved - the Cross. Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!
-- John Adams
The doctrine of the divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity.
-- John Adams The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.
-- John Adams The Christian religion not only was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without one.
-- David Hume During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What has been its fruits? More or less, in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution.
-- James Madison What influence in fact have Christian ecclesiastical establishments had on civil society? In many instances they have been upholding the thrones of political tyranny. In no instance have they been seen as the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty have found in the clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate liberty, does not need the clergy.
-- James Madison I can hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother, and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.
-- Charles Darwin One does well to put on gloves when reading the New Testament. The proximity of so much uncleanliness almost forces one to do this.
-- Friedrich Nietzsche It is a farce to call any being virtuous whose virtues do not result from the exercise of its own reason.
-- Mary Wollstonecraft
