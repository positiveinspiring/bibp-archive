Who are these people? Some will immediately chime in, "They aren't people at
all!" Perhaps so... perhaps not.
They go by many names:
...are but a few.
The broad term, Parasitical Elite, is
more description than a branded label.
There is a designed ambiguity surrounding the Parasitical Elite. Through
millennia, however, certain constants manifest themselves; they are as
unavoidable as the age found in a person's eyes regardless of the best
efforts of cosmetic surgery.
Parasitical Elites, regardless who you think
they are, are evil. 'Evil' is itself a subjective term, but in the broad
context of the thought processes of non-psychopathic people, we can all
agree on a universal definition of evil as the desire to do harm to others.
From before the time of Christ, in
ancient Sumeria, right up to present day, the Parasitical Elite
have alternately appeared, disappeared and reappeared under different
guises; in the form of,
This is not accidental. Obfuscation is a pillar
upon which their
agenda for global domination rests.
The employment of the root word 'parasite' is accurate. Regardless of what
they choose to be known as within any given epoch, they are parasites - they
latch on to a host and drain it of whatever is required for the parasite to
thrive.
How far the blinders have come off will usually help define what we consider
to be the Parasitical Elite.
For those newly awoken, the Parasitical Elite
might be,
All of these are correct, in one fashion or
another. And all of these are not correct - this is the nature of created
ambiguity.
Confusion is the Parasitical Elite's friend. If
everyone is the bogeyman, then no one is the bogeyman. These parasites
operate on many levels; attaching to races, institutions and ideologies
until such time as they have consumed their micro host and move on to more
fertile ground from which to ever realize their goal of global domination.
From domination comes fear and negativity. We,
humanity, are the primary host from which they seek to feed upon. They do so
by creating and controlling instruments (nothing more, really) such as
belief systems and political systems such as communism and socialism...
'isms' that fight each other and create fear and death.
Parasites depleting the host... us.
This article's title question still begs to be answered. Some might ask who
they are. Others, with an eye to a larger canvass, might ask what they are.
Are they aliens, as William Bramley, author of
Gods of Eden believes? He makes a very
convincing case to that effect.
This worthy read will open anyone's eyes to a
great unveiling of truths.
Even if one cannot or will not subscribe to
the alien 'theory'
convincingly posited, there is a great deal of historically accurate data
pertaining to,
Many believe the Parasitical Elite are divine
beings of evil origin.
How they differ from aliens is a theological
distinction that escapes me, but many will defend that argument. It is
believed they have come to us or been cast from their place of origin,
depending on what holy book or legend one ascribes to. Wherever they come
from, they are here to feed upon negativity and fear.
This rings especially loud when speaking of
Satan and his demon horde.
There is a library of Alexandria-esque
proportions detailing the hierarchy for these entities, sub-categories of
demons and angels, such as Nephilim, Seraphim's, demi-gods and demi-urges
and the like.
Beneath this blanket nestles a host of various
mythologies and theological structures such as the Greek Gods, the Norse
gods, and a great many non-western and tribal mythologies. Without intending
to ruffle any feathers, a widely held belief claims modern,
organized western religions are simply
present day humanity's current theological lover.
Will Christ, or Allah, or Shiva
be spoken of in current context two thousand years from now? Perhaps, as
they have survived that long already.
But in five thousand years? Six thousand? Before
answering a thunderously indignant "OF COURSE!", ask yourself if you can
name the primary
Gods of Sumer, or
even Egypt.
Most cannot, yet they were deities that shaped
the course of our history. Many will argue that these deities of antiquity
have been rebranded into the deities we worship today, and I will not argue
that assertion, finding it to be spot on.
In defining the Parasitical Elite, dipping in the shallow end of the pool, a
person's opinion of the elite goes no farther than politicians and
businessmen.
Deeper into water, reaching above the waist, the opinion of who the
Parasitical Elite are changes. The veil is lifted a bit and central
banksters, the multi-trillion
Rothschild clan or their evil and
malevolent offspring
the Rockefellers become identified.
Subsidiary evils might include,
...all evil,
all psychopathic in leadership, membership
and objectives.
Yet all are just clothes of different cuts,
emanating from the same wardrobe. They are, indeed, but garments draped upon
evil entities; the physical manifestations required to give corporeal
substance to these malevolent entities, the better to aide in their ongoing
campaign of destruction and control.
To swim in the deep end is to lose purchase with our physical reality, much
as one must tread water to remain afloat.
The universe is a big place. Infinite?
Maybe. Do we inhabit just one universe in an
ocean of universes? Perhaps.
Science has proven that within the broad
electromagnetic spectrum, our decidedly limited scope of perception
perceives a tiny fraction of what is known to exist. If we can allow there
is a vast spectrum of energy and existence we are not privy to, then we must
allow the possibility of invisible (undetectable within the scope of our
visible electromagnetic spectrum) entities existing all around us.
Some will call these unseen entities spirits,
demons, ghosts or Gods. Given (we now know) there is more unknown than
known, we cannot rule out they do not exist. It is more probable and logical
to allow that they do exist.
Being of non-physical substance, they do not eat
food as we define food. They do not get drunk on what we call alcohol. These
entities feed upon fear and negative emotion.
The tools they use to grow their food are found
in the machinations of,
...all dedicated to sowing fear and creating
negative emotion within us.
This is their food. This is the harvest they
seek to reap, and our planet is the field.
We, as individuals are the kernels. But they
don't want wheat - they want the chaff. Where there is wheat, they seek to
create chaff. It is the more fertile from which to germinate fear and
insecurity, the consumption of which only makes them stronger.
Allowing there is a yin and yang to everything, a universal balance if you
will, then the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that love is the antidote
to hate; that positive emotion is the antidote to negative emotion.
There is a universal battle being waged for our little sparks of energy each
of us possesses.
One side, via the trappings of various earthly
instruments, seeks to entrap us in fear, while the other side seeks
to envelop us in love. Negative entities are decidedly more
proactive, while the forces of light, no less concerned or desirous of our
energy, remain in stasis; it is only by embracing love that one can become
part of it. Positive light and love cannot be accepted in the form of
deception, whereas fear can.
Fortunately, all but the darkest heart
instinctively will shy from evil.
As social psychologists would have it, roughly
4% of the human population will embrace evil. A brighter outlook on this is
that 96% will not seek out evil, but must have it inserted.
This is where the Parasitical Elite shine via
their earthly instruments.
Industries created to promote lust, greed,
covetousness, materialism, pornography, inebriation and a boatload of other
human weaknesses; these are the keys that open the door to fear and
negativity.
Those lesser and mis-diagnosed definitions of
Parasitical Elites found in the shallow waters of the newly awakened are
only tools created by the true Parasitical Elites... tools designed to
separate us, or our spiritual energy, to be precise, from the light and
positive energy that love emits.
So, at the end of the day, the only way to defeat these Parasitical Elites
is to reject
their wars, their moral corruptions and
other means designed and projected on us daily in an effort to keep us from
the light of love.
Darkness flees before light. One doesn't go into
a well lit room and ignite a candle of darkness to banish the light. Sadly,
these Parasitical Elite
have used religions for eons as the primary vehicle to
create despair.
War is evil incarnate. There is no good or
justified war. There is simply war. Christians, Jews and Muslims, take heed!
Your violent defense of your faith is little more than fuel to stoke the
furnace of evil.
Peace is love... to embrace peace is to embrace
the light.
As Gandhi said,
"There is no path to peace, peace is the
path."
