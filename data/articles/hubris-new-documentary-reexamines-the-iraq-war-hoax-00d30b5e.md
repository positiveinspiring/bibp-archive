# "Hubris" - New Documentary Reexamines The Iraq War "Hoax"

A decade ago, on March 19, 2003, President
George W. Bush launched the
invasion of Iraq that would lead to a nine-year war resulting in,
-
4,486 dead American troops
-
32,226 service members wounded
-
over 100,000 dead Iraqi civilians
The tab for the war topped $3 trillion.
Bush did succeed in removing Saddam Hussein,
but it turned out there were no weapons of mass destruction and no
significant operational ties between Saddam's regime and Al Qaeda. That
is, the two main assertions used by Bush and his crew to justify the war
were not true.
Three years after the war began, Michael
Isikoff, then an investigative reporter for Newsweek (he's
since moved to NBC News), and I published
Hubris - The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the
Selling of the Iraq War, a behind-the-scenes account of
how Bush, Vice President
Dick Cheney, and their lieutenants
deployed,
-
false claims
-
iffy intelligence
-
unsupported hyperbole,
...to
win popular backing for the invasion.
Our book, hailed by the New York Times
as,
"the most comprehensive account of the
White House's political machinations",
...was the first cut at an important topic:
how a president had swindled the nation into war with a deliberate
effort to hype the threat.
The book is now the basis for an
MSNBC documentary
of the same name that marks the 10th anniversary of the Iraq
war.
Hosted by
Rachel Maddow, the film premieres
Monday night in her usual time slot (9PM ET/PT). But the documentary
goes beyond what Isikoff and I covered in Hubris, presenting
new scoops and showing that the complete story of the selling of that
war has yet to be told.
One chilling moment in the film comes in an
interview with retired General Anthony Zinni, a former commander
in chief of US Central Command.
In August 2002, the Bush-Cheney
administration opened its propaganda campaign for war with a Cheney
speech at the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention.
The veep made a stark declaration:
"There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein
now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt he is
amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and
against us."
"No doubt," he proclaimed, "Saddam is arming
himself with WMD in preparation for attacking the United States."
Zinni was sitting on the stage during the
speech, and in the documentary he recalls his reaction:
It was a shock. It was a total shock. I
couldn't believe the vice president was saying this, you know?
In
doing work with the CIA on Iraq WMD, through all the briefings I
heard at Langley, I never saw one piece of credible evidence that
there was an ongoing program.
And that's when I began to believe
they're getting serious about this. They want to go into Iraq.
That Zinni quote should almost end the
debate on whether the Bush-Cheney administration purposefully guided the
nation into war with misinformation and disinformation.
But there's more. So much more. The film
highlights a Pentagon document declassified two years ago.
This
memo notes (click below images) that in November 2001 - shortly after
the 9/11 attacks -
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld met with General Tommy Franks to
review plans for the "decapitation" of the Iraqi government.

The two men
reviewed how a war against Saddam could be triggered; that list included
a "dispute over WMD inspections."
It's evidence that the administration was
seeking a pretense for war.
The yellowcake uranium supposedly
bought by Saddam in Niger, the aluminum tubes supposedly used to process
uranium into weapons-grade material, the supposed connection between
Saddam and Osama bin Laden - the documentary features intelligence
analysts and experts who at the time were saying and warning that the
intelligence on these topics was wrong or uncertain.
Yet administration officials kept using
lousy and inconclusive intelligence to push the case for war.
Through the months-long run-up to the
invasion, Colin Powell, then the secretary of state, would become
the administration's No. 1 pitchman for the war with a high-profile
speech at the UN, which contained numerous false statements about Iraq
and WMD.
But, the documentary notes, he was hiding
from the public his deep skepticism.
In the film, Lawrence Wilkerson,
Powell's chief of staff at the time, recalls the day Congress passed a
resolution authorizing Bush to attack Iraq:
Powell walked into my office and without
so much as a fare-thee-well, he walked over to the window and he
said,
"I wonder what'll happen when we put
500,000 troops into Iraq and comb the country from one end to
the other and find nothing?"
And he turned around and walked back in
his office.
And I - I wrote that down on my calendar
- as close for - to verbatim as I could, because I thought that was
a profound statement coming from the secretary of state, former
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.
Wilkerson also notes that Powell had no idea
about the veracity of the intelligence he cited during that UN speech:
"Though neither Powell nor anyone else
from the State Department team intentionally lied, we did
participate in a hoax."
A hoax. That's what it was.
Yet Bush and Cheney went on to win
reelection, and many of their accomplices in this swindle never were
fully held accountable. In the years after the WMD scam became apparent,
there certainly was a rise in public skepticism and media scrutiny of
government claims.
Still, could something like this happen
again?
Maddow remarks,
"If what we went through 10 years ago
did not change us as a nation - if we do not understand what
happened and adapt to resist it - then history says we are doomed to
repeat it."
