# Global Fraud - Global Hope - An Address to The International UFO Congress

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalbanking136.htm

The
world financial system is a
total fraud.
It is one gargantuan
Ponzi scheme, no better than
the one Bernie Madoff used to swindle his friends and neighbors,
and thousands of times worse if you add up the total number of
victims it has ripped off over countless generations.
The principal difference between the two schemes is that Madoff
was acting outside the law while the international banking
cartel has persuaded generation after generation of monarchs,
presidents and prime ministers to provide legislative protection
for their larceny.
The banks Ponzi scheme is alarmingly simple. They lend the same
money to several people or institutions at the same time and
collect interest on it from each. What the banks really lend,
however, is their credit, and what they take back in
compensation for that privilege is a debt that must be repaid
with interest.
The number of times they lend the same money is called
leverage.
The practice is as old as the hills
but for our purposes we can start with the goldsmiths of Lombard
Street in London, England, who accepted deposits for which they
issued certificates redeemable on demand. They paid their
depositors a nominal interest rate on the understanding that
they could lend the money to their customers at higher interest
rates.
They soon found that they could lend
more than they had in their vaults because only a few depositors
came in to redeem their gold or silver at any one time. It was a
scam. It was illegal. Nevertheless they got away with it for a
long while and the scam was legitimized when the Bank of England
was chartered to help King William finance his war.
Rich people subscribed £1,200,000 in
gold and silver, as capital, to found the bank, which then was
lent to the government at 8 percent. To show his appreciation
the King allowed the bank to print £1,200,000 in banknotes and
lend them at high interest rates.
In effect, the bank was allowed to
lend the same money twice - once to the government and
once to the people.
Over the years, due to the avarice of the banks and the
complicity of the politicians, that ratio has increased
dramatically. In the early days of the 20th century,
federal chartered U.S. banks were required to keep gold reserves
of 25 percent. That means they were allowed to lend the same
money four times.
I remember when Canadian banks were
required to maintain a cash reserve of 8 percent. That means
they were allowed to lend the same money 12½ times.
Today, thanks to Milton Friedmans irrational flip-flop from
being a proponent of 100% cash reserves to the opposite extreme
of zero reserves, and the adoption of his ideas by the major
central banks of the world in 1974, multiples have increased
dramatically - in some cases to as much as 20 to 1 or more.
Banks only keep enough cash to meet
day-to-day demands for those few customers who go in and request
it, and consequently the fraud is virtually total.
The system works this way.
Suppose that you want to borrow
$35,000 to buy a new car. You visit your friendly banker and ask
for a loan. He or she will ask you for collateral - some stocks,
bonds, a second mortgage on your house or cottage or, if you are
unable to supply any of these, the co-signature of a well-to-do
friend or relative. When the collateral requirement is satisfied
you will be asked to sign a note for the principal amount with
an agreed rate of interest.
When the paperwork is complete, and the note signed, your banker
will make an entry on the banks computer and, presto, a $35,000
credit will appear in your account which you can use to buy your
car. The important point is that seconds earlier that money
did not exist. It was created out of thin air - so to speak.
The banking equation is a species of double-entry bookkeeping
where your note becomes an asset on the banks books, and the
new money that was deposited to your account is a liability.
The profit for the bank comes from
the difference between the low rate of interest, if any, you
would be paid on your deposit if you didnt spend the borrowed
money immediately, and the much higher rate you would be obliged
to pay on your note - the technical term is the
spread.
At some point, however, you have to pay off your note and any
interest owing. And not only you but everyone else who has
borrowed money from banks - including governments which, by
the way, own the right to print money but that have
irresponsibly handed the right over to an elite group of private
bankers.
Anyone who defaults is in big
trouble. Individuals who default will have the assets they
pledged as collateral seized by the bank.
A government that is in danger of
defaulting, will be forced to borrow from the
International Monetary Fund,
which will then tell that government how to run its affairs
including cutting back on services and selling off public assets
to the international vulture capitalists.
In reality, then, the banks have turned the world into one
humongous pawn shop. You hock your stocks, bonds, house,
business, rich mother-in-law or country and the bank(s) will
give you a loan based on the value of the collateral.
A world system where all the money is created as debt is a
perpetual disaster in the making. It is like a giant balloon
that the banks pump full of debt. The balloon gets larger and
larger until the debt load becomes too heavy to carry, and then
it is like a balloon with a pin stuck in it. The system crashes
and thousands or sometimes millions of innocent people lose
their jobs, homes, farms and businesses.
Almost any high school student should be able to see that any
monetary system based on debt creation is totally insane.
The total world debt,
mathematically, is always tending toward infinity - and there is
no possible way of paying it off. The real money (legal tender)
to do so doesnt exist. And the real economy that depends on
cash to grow shifts into low gear whenever the supply of credit
money dries up.
Not surprisingly, there have been 25 recessions and depressions
in the United States since 1890. In several cases, including the
Great Depression of the 1930s and
the current Great Recession,
the evidence indicates that the meltdown was anticipated by a
few insiders who helped trigger the catastrophe.
In the wake of the Great Depression, the U.S. Senate Banking and
Currency Committee Report that became widely known as the
Pecora Report on the Practices
of Stock Exchanges, indicated that there were insiders who
benefitted from the crash.
Legal chicanery and pitch
darkness were the bankers stoutest allies, Pecora wrote in
his memoir.
Similar allegations were evident in
Charles Ferguson damning documentary
Inside
Job, relating to the 2007-2008 meltdown.
These reports, and other historical
evidence prove beyond any doubt that much of Wall Street is
rotten to the core. It has become one gigantic millstone around
the neck of both the American and world economies.
The collateral damage from the recent meltdown has been
staggering. The U.S. Bureau of Labor estimated that 8.4 million
jobs were lost in the U.S. alone. Most countries experienced
similar dramatic losses.
The reduction in asset values
worldwide has been estimated at $20 trillion U.S. dollars, yet
not a single one of the culprits is in jail. You would think
that someone would have had the decency to launch a class action
for at least $10 trillion against every individual and every
organization that contributed to the catastrophe in any way.
It boggles the mind that a system so vulnerable to manipulation
would ever have come into existence in the first place. The
evolution did not happen by accident. It was not guided by the
mythical invisible hand of Adam Smith. On the contrary, for more
than a century-and-a-half, it was engineered by the barely
visible hand of
the Rothschild family and its allies, and since
World War II by the Rockefeller family.
The two dynasties
combined forces to exercise influence on many fronts sheltered
by the cloak of secrecy established by
the Bilderberg Group.
The long term influence of the banking cartel is incalculable.
Their biggest coup was the establishment of the
Federal Reserve
System in the United States. The big New York banks really
didnt like the idea of genuine competition, so a small group
held a secret meeting at the private resort of J.P. Morgan on
Jekyll Island, off the coast of Georgia.
Their scheme, devised by Paul M.
Warburg, and subsequently adopted by Congress, is a legal
private monopoly of the U.S. money supply operated for the
benefit of the few under the guise of protecting and promoting
the public interest.
It is a tribute to the skill of the international bankers that
they were able to draft a bill, revise it, change its name and
make the few window dressing compromises necessary to get it
adopted by Congress just before Christmas when quite a few
Representatives must have been dreaming of sugar plum fairies
instead of exercising due diligence. Only Charles Lindberg Sr.
seemed to grasp the essence of what was going on.
To put it bluntly, the Congress transferred its sovereign
constitutional right to create money to the sole custody of a
group of private bankers. The magnitude of the hoist is
unprecedented in the history of the world - the numbers now are
in the high trillions.
Soon after the bill was passed the magnitude of the tragedy
began to be recognized.
William Jennings Bryan, who acted as
Democrat whip, later said:
In my long political career,
the one thing I genuinely regret is my part in getting the
banking and currency legislation (Federal Reserve Act of
1913) enacted into law.
President Woodrow Wilson, just three
years after passage of the Act, wrote:
A great industrial nation is
controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is
concentrated (in the Federal Reserve System). The growth of
the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the
hands of a few men
We have come to be one of the worst
ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated
governments in the civilized world.
But the bill was not repealed;
almost 100 years later the sell-out is still the law.
This makes
you wonder what the peoples representatives have been doing to
earn their salaries.
The people in charge of the original deception were very
far-seeing. They realized that when future governments had to
borrow from them they would need a constant income stream to pay
the interest on the bonds.
So they persuaded the government to
introduce income taxes, first as a temporary measure, but later
permanently, so it would be able to meet its obligations to the
bondholders. In fiscal year 2005 total individual income taxes
in the U.S. totaled $927 billion. Of that amount $352 billion,
or 38%, was required just to pay interest on the federal debt.
The figure would be higher now.
The banksters, as they were often called, then decided that an
independent press might catch on to the chicanery.
Oscar Callaway is reported in the
Congressional Record of February 9, 1917 as follows.
In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan
interests, the steel, shipbuilding, and powder interests,
and their subsidiary organizations, got together 12 men high
up in the newspaper world, and employed them to select the
most influential newspapers in the United States and
sufficient number of them to
control generally the policy of
the daily press of the United States
They found it was only necessary
to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers.
The 25 papers were agreed upon;
emissaries were sent to purchase the policy, national and
international, of these papers;
an editor was furnished
for each paper to properly supervise and edit information
regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism,
financial policies, and other things of national and
international nature considered vital to the interests of
the purchasers [and to suppress] everything in opposition to
the wishes of the interests served.
It has been suggested that the
Bilderberger Group may have taken a leaf from the Morgan
precedent to protect their interests in the late 20th and early
21st centuries.
That is impossible to prove because
its members are sworn to secrecy, and the press wont report on
its meetings.
Could it be mere coincidence that the monetary
system, the downside of globalization and the decades-long
cover-up of the extraterrestrial presence and technology
(especially the clean energy sources that would impact the value
of oil stocks), the three subjects of most direct beneficial
interests of the banksters, are the three subjects that are
avoided like the plague by the mainline press?
I am not willing to go so far as to say that the men behind the
international banking system are evil men because their thoughts
are private.
But Sir Josiah, later
Baron Stamp, a
former director of the Bank of England, has given us a rare
snapshot of the truth.
Banking was conceived in
iniquity and was born in sin. The Bankers own the earth.
Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create
money, and with a flick of the pen they will create enough
money to buy it back again.
However, take that power away
from them and all the great fortunes like mine will
disappear, and they ought to disappear, for this would be a
happier and better world to live in.
But if you wish to remain the
slaves of Bankers, and pay the cost of your own slavery, let
them continue to create money.
In the latest meltdown of 2007-2008,
the Fed acted quickly to prevent the Ponzi pyramid from
collapsing completely.
It printed trillions of dollars to bail
out the banks and a few industries that were highly indebted to
banks.
But what did the Fed do for the taxpayers whose money was so
wildly diluted to save the banks? Nothing! They were left to
fend for themselves. Millions of people lost their jobs, their
farms, their houses, their hopes, and their dignity as a result
of circumstances beyond their control. The taxpayers bailed out
the banks, but got nothing in return.
The same is true of governments who came so quickly to the
rescue. As a result of the meltdown their revenues were
decreased so they were forced to incur or increase their
deficits, as well as to start cutting back on essential
services.
The Fed pretended to be helping stimulate the economy by
reducing interest rates to near zero. It would be an interesting
exercise to find out what happened to all of this low-cost
money.
It would be a good subject for Congressional attention.
-
How much did the banks use to buy up domestic and foreign assets
at fire-sale prices?
-
Was any of it used by financial
institutions to try to corner world food markets and raise
prices at a time when millions are starving?
-
No doubt some taxpayers did take advantage of the low interest
rates available but were they warned about the old bait and
switch game?
Anyone who acquires assets with cheap money runs
the risk of losing their property when the Fed ultimately raises
rates.
Its all part of the boom-bust cycle
inherent in our infinitely silly monetary system.
The
Economics Profession
What does all this have to say about the economics profession?
What it really says isnt fit to
print.
Someone once said that if you put 20 economists in a room
you will get 21 opinions.
That is not my experience. If you get 20 economists together
they are likely to give you one stock answer, or at most two.
And if there is one dissenter he or she is likely to be drowned
out by the 19, squawking like a flock of parrots the words
memorized from what their professors taught them.
I have witnessed this herd-like mentality firsthand. When I was
first elected to the House of Commons in 1949 there were only a
handful of
Keynesians in Ottawa. Twenty years later nearly
everyone was a Keynesian including, I am told, Richard Nixon.
At that time there were only a few monetarists around. But they
spread like mushrooms and soon dominated the economic landscape.
It reached the stage when Keynes was anathema, and it was almost
impossible to get a tenured position in a school of economics
unless you were part of Milton Friedmans monetarist revolution.
Apparently little if any thought was given to the possibility
that neither Keynes nor Friedman had got it right.
The former was a bit closer to
reality than the latter, but both theories foundered on the
rocks of one inescapable truth. Both assumed that the economic
system is self-correcting, yet more than two centuries of
experience has demonstrated clearly that it is not!
Someone has to be at the tiller
charged with steering clear of the shoals and rocks of economic
disaster and that person has to be someone who is responsible to
the people and not the self-serving boom-busters.
Global
Warming
While bank reform is the most urgent problem facing the world
today, it is
global warming that has equally or even greater
long term consequences.
It is a total fraud to pretend that
we have thirty, forty or fifty years to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. There are reputable scientists who think we may
already have crossed the Rubicon. Even if that is true, we cant
roll the clock back; we can only influence the present and the
future.
Each of the past three decades has been the hottest on
record, according to a report released in July 2010 by the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The report pulled together data from
ten climate change indicators, measured by 160 research groups
in 48 countries.
The data shows,
-
sea levels are rising
-
snow cover in the Arctic
melts earlier
-
the average air temperature is rising
-
ocean
surface temperatures have also been rising
-
the summer sea ice
cover is declining
-
sea air temperature has been rising
-
for 19
years glaciers have lost mass
-
land air temperature has
been rising - a global trend
All of this puts the lie to the propaganda of
the oil industry
aimed at creating doubt about the reliability of scientific
data.
Taking a leaf from the tobacco industry, which managed to
create doubt about the safety of their products years after they
privately knew the facts, the oil industry has been attempting
to raise doubt about the urgency of replacing fossil fuels with
clean energy, and with considerable success.
In their case, however, the stakes
are higher. It was a tragedy that so many people lost their
lives through lack of sound information about the consequences
of smoking. In the case of global warming, however, many times
more people will have their lives put at risk.
Still the oil cartel is making plans as if nothing is going to
change, and that we are going to be stuck with a fatal oil
economy for decades until the damage is irreversible. It is too
late to begin more offshore drilling. It is too late for new
developments in the Alberta oil sands. It is too late for more
noisy windmill farms. The transition must start now, with a
10-year deadline.
Is that possible? Of course its possible but only with the kind
of mobilization essential to win a war for survival.
One excuse for inaction has been the
lack of money due to government deficits and debt. But that
obstacle can be overcome in less than a year if governments and
legislatures change the system and exercise their sovereign
right to make what is physically possible financially possible.
Heaven knows there are millions of unemployed workers worldwide
waiting to rise to the challenge.
The other major obstacle has been a lack of consensus on the
form of clean energy to use to replace fossil fuels. And that brings me, finally, to the
subject of the day,
the extraterrestrial presence and
technology.
The
Extraterrestrial Presence and Technology
It is a fraud for the U.S. government to pretend that it is not
interested in
UFOs.
In fact, it has been a matter of
high and probably pre-eminent interest for decades.
An early Canadian ufologist,
Wilbert Smith, who was a senior
employee at the Department of Transport, where I became minister
not long after his retirement, wrote a top secret memorandum to
the Controller of Communications dated November 21, 1950 asking
permission to set up a group to study the geomagnetic aspects of
UFOs propulsion systems.
As part of his memorandum Smith said that he had made discreet
enquiries through the Canadian embassy staff in Washington where
he obtained the following information.
-
The matter is the most
highly classified subject in the United States
Government, rating higher even than the H-bomb.
-
Flying saucers exist.
-
Their modus operandi is
unknown but concentrated effort is being made by a small
group, headed by Doctor Vannevar Bush.
-
The entire matter is
considered by the United States authorities to be of
tremendous significance.
So, Dr. Vannevar Bush, one of
Americas pre-eminent scientists, and a team of experts he had
assembled, were already working on
back-engineering by 1950.
(Back-engineering is the combined
art and science of analyzing an object, in this case parts of a
crashed vehicle, in order to determine its characteristics for
possible replication or adaptation.)
Many people who are interested in the subject of UFOs use one of
the Roswell crashes of July 1947 as their starting line. Recent
evidence, however, confirms that the U.S. Army Air Corps was in
the crash retrieval business before that.
Paola Harris, on July 5, 2010
interviewed two men, Jose Padilla and Reme Baca, aged 9 and 7 at
the time, who witnessed a saucer crash on Padilla land near San
Antonio, New Mexico, in August 1945.
In her new book
Exopolitics:
Stargate to a New Reality, Paola gives the detailed account
of what these men saw as children, the actual crash, the
creatures appearance, the pieces of the craft they took, the
military clean up, and an in-depth analysis of the significance
of the case.
I had the opportunity to chat with Reme Baca by telephone
recently and the thing that stuck in my mind was that when Sgt.
Avila came to ask Mr. Padillas permission to enter his land to
retrieve the object, he referred to it as an experimental
weather balloon. That was exactly the same ruse that Brigadier
General Roger Ramey used in reference to the Roswell incident
two years later.
Apparently there was a considerable
lack of imagination on the Armys part.
In later years the Air Force, that had succeeded the Army Air
Corps, became much more sophisticated in its misinformation and
disinformation techniques. These include having the Star
Visitors portrayed in movies as sinister beings that we should
be fearful of - probably without justification.
Another fascinating case that Paola brought to my attention not
long ago was that of
Charles Hall, the physicist and information
technology professional, who worked as an airman meteorologist
at the USAF bombing and gunnery range at Indian Springs, Nevada,
in the 1960s.
Charles worked in close contact with
Tall Whites, a species that
I had been previously unfamiliar with. Over a period of months
he learned to lose his fear of the aliens who lived, worked and
played on Air Force property.
In a two-hour telephone conversation he gave me many of the
characteristics of the Whites, described the scout ships in
which they travelled and said most of them were assembled in the
U.S. Furthermore, he talked about the mother ship arriving on
the nights of the full moon and sliding into its hangar cut into
the side of a mountain nearby.
It was all fascinating stuff that included the fact that the
Tall Whites were working closely with the USAF and exchanging
technology in the mid-1960s.
So it is very difficult to imagine
how much has been achieved in 60 years of back-engineering alien
technology that was much more advanced than our own. There is no
doubt that myriad scientists, technicians, and many of Americas
most advanced aircraft and weapons corporations must have
achieved what would have been classified as miracles just a few
years ago.
It is alleged that the U.S. engineers working in one of the vast
underground facilities have built vehicles that are virtually
indistinguishable from those of other planets. If this is true,
to what purpose will they be put, and will it be for good
purposes or military purposes?
The area of discovery that is most relevant to this
presentation, however, is the question of exotic energy sources.
Years ago it was reported that both zero point and cold fusion
energy had been developed. These are energy sources that could
facilitate the 10-year target date and not only revolutionalize
the world for the better, but help preserve it as a happy
habitat for Earthlings.
In the unlikely event that these sources are not yet
commercially viable, all we would have to do is ask one of the
friendly species to help us and they would because they are
deeply concerned about our stewardship.
In the event that we are still
treating them as enemy aliens, and doing our best to shoot them
down, we would have to curb our lust of conflict and adopt an
acceptable level of intergalactic civility.
Better
People
The third essential change is for us as individuals.
A just and peaceful world is not
possible when it is riddled with graft, fraud and corruption of
all kinds. Greed is king and mammon rules the world.
Institutions have to change too. For centuries major religions
have been selling their alleged superiority or exclusiveness at
the point of a sword, leading to the deaths of thousands of
innocents. The
three Abrahamic religions, for example, all claim
the inside route to paradise. Mathematically that is impossible.
It is far more probable, mathematically, that they are all wrong
and that the truth is larger and more inclusive.
Ancient and modern history both suggest that there is no hope of
a just and peaceful world unless all religions, and those with
no religion, forget their differences and start working together
to build the Kingdom of God on Earth. I define this as a world
where every child can expect food to eat, clean water to drink,
adequate clothing to wear, a roof overhead, access to medical
support and enough education to be able to determine how best he
or she can serve humankind positively, with dignity and
self-fulfillment.
What a wonderful world that would be! But it would require a
180-degree change in policies and priorities and a serious
effort to apply the Golden Rule that all religions claim as a
common thread.
The application of the Golden Rule would mean an end to empire
building, and the pursuit of military power and advantage. The
U.S., for example, would have to stop being its own worst enemy.
The declaration of the war on terror was the biggest strategic
blunder I have seen.
On the
11th day of September 2001, following the attacks on the
World Trade Center, the United States enjoyed the sympathy of
the world, including Arab states and populations. The threat
from al-Qaeda was limited and quite within the potential of
police and intelligence operations to cope with.
The situation changed dramatically with the launch of a war on
Iraq. The goodwill began to evaporate overnight. Soon, instead
of a few dozens insurgents the numbers of young Muslims willing
to die for their cause multiplied to thousands and a great chasm
of hate and mistrust enveloped much of the world.
The U.S. has consistently refused to be even-handed in the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute, and the Israelis deceive
themselves, and the world, when they claim to be the victims.
For a long while peace has been within their grasp if they could
have agreed to a just settlement, and establishment of a vibrant
Palestinian state.
But a handful of fundamentalists
have always succeeded in disrupting the peace process because
they are not willing to accept the great Rabbi Hillels
admonition.
So always treat others the way
you would like them to treat you; that is the message of the
Law and the Prophets.
Meanwhile the peace and stability of
the world remains in jeopardy.
The world community must adopt principles and practices that
override fundamentalists of any stripe whether they be
Christian, Muslim, Jewish or Economic.
In addition, religious people should
pay more attention to their holy books. There is nothing in
the
Bible that would legitimize a preventive war, with its carpet
bombing, or the launch of a drone or missile intended to kill
one person when there is risk that innocent bystanders will also
die.
Similarly, there is nothing in the
Quran that would justify suicide bombing that results in the
random death of innocents.
Global
Hope
If you get the impression that the world is going to hell in a
hand basket you have heard me correctly. But it doesnt need to
be so. There are remedies but they involve
massive change in the areas discussed - none of which are even
on the political radar at present.
There is light at the end of
the tunnel but, as Sir John Quinton, a former chairman of
Barclays Bank said,
Bankers sometimes look on politicians as
people who, when they see light at the end of the tunnel, order
more tunnel.
What we are really talking about is restoring democracy to
countries that not only claim they have it, but also take pride
in trying to export it, even though they dont really qualify as
democratic as defined in the dictionary.
In Websters it is:
government in which supreme
power is vested in the people and exercised by them or their
elected representatives.
To begin, Wall Street has been the
dominant power in the U.S. for decades, and still is.
Add to that the fact that the
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, the President of the
United States, does not have the security clearance for a number
of projects controlled by troops under his command, and you have
to conclude that the U.S. is not really a democracy.
The same can be said about Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany
and myriad countries that are really puppets of the
International Financial System. In each case the real interests
of citizen voters is subjugated to the demands of international
finance.
There is a sad irony in reading U.S. history of the
pre-revolutionary and revolutionary days. Historians often
attribute the revolution to the tax on tea.
On the other hand,
[Benjamin] Franklin cited restrictions upon paper money as one
of the main reasons for the alienation of the American provinces
from the mother country.
The U.S. won the revolutionary war but
then lost the next critical one when it adopted the British
banking system instead of pursuing the better model their
provinces had been experimenting with.
For the U.S. now to inflict the British practice on countries
around the world, using the
International Monetary Fund and
World Bank as enforcers, is comparable to the Kings edict that
gave birth to the United States. So the financial chains of
oppression have to be broken and freedom restored to citizens
everywhere.
Its time to forget the tea party and address the critically
important issues facing the U.S. and the world. All of these
issues are non-partisan by definition and deserve the attention
and support of all genuine patriots without distinction of race,
color, religion or political affiliation - both in the U.S. and
worldwide.
We must unite to preserve and
enhance the beautiful satellite that is our birthright.
An Agenda
for Action
The first and most urgent project is to clip the wings of the
bankers and democratize the money-creation function.
In the U.S. the Federal Reserve
System must be abolished and its alleged function of regulating
the money supply be assumed by the federal government or an
agency under its direct control. The most powerful and valuable
tool in the economic arsenal must be available to the
representatives of the people who can be held responsible for
their success or failure.
Some monetary reformers recommend that governments create 100%
of new money in a debt free form, greenbacks or equivalent. In
the interests of a fast and smooth transition I am suggesting
that a ratio of 34% government-created money to 66% bank-created
money would work satisfactorily. Banks would be required to
maintain 34% cash reserves against their deposits.
The important thing is that governments must immediately create
the large sums necessary to balance their budgets and get their
economies running at maximum output again. I am talking about an
infusion of perhaps $10 trillion U.S. dollar equivalent to start
and more if needed to get economies up to speed and to reduce
unemployment worldwide by at least half, with the creation of
millions of new jobs.
Is this likely to cause massive inflation, as the financial
cartel will immediately allege, because it is one of its longest
running and most successful bugbears? The answer to their phony
phonetics is a resounding no.
As any economist should know, it is
the amount of money that is created that influences prices, and
not who prints it. So as long as governments limit what
economists call the multiplier effect there will be no
problem.
Certainly the present system has been inflationary.
A 1950 U.S.
dollar is only worth 7.5 cents today. A common sense monetary
system should produce better results than that. So there is no
reason why the banking system should not be fundamentally
reformed - at once!
There are four other actions that I think we, the people of the
world should demand of our politicians.
-
A law must be passed at once
to prohibit all politicians, candidates for political
office and political parties from accepting money from
any financial institution as well as make it a criminal
offense for any such institution either directly or
indirectly to offer it.
-
World leaders must adopt a
10-year time frame to reduce greenhouse emissions by 90
percent.
-
That will only be possible
if the U.S. discloses its knowledge of the ET presence
and technology, and what has been accomplished in 60
years of back-engineering.
-
The U.N. should declare 2012
the year of forgiveness and reconciliation - a new era
of cooperation and (agape) love between races, tribes,
religions, nations, and regions both mondial and
intergalactic. We have so much to learn from our star
visitors in many areas including medicine and food
production.
So the U.S. must relinquish its
privileged position as the center of the loop as part of a new
kind of leadership in creating the better world we all dream of.
International Finance vs. The People of the World
None of this vision of a just and peaceful world will be
possible unless the all-pervasive power of the international
banks has been broken.
In 1999 I wrote a book in which I
said the next world war would be between the banks and the
people of the world. There have been skirmishes for centuries
and, so far, the banks have always come out on top.
They are now
taking advantage of the recent meltdown, and the resulting
sovereign debt crisis to line up their heavy artillery including,
...for a
final conclusive battle.
As always the aim of the game is to rob the people of the world
of their sovereign right to govern their own affairs, and to
entrench the power of the international banks, their elite
industrial allies and a small cabal of military insiders who run
the world as their private fiefdom. The word unjust is too
small a word by far to describe what they are up to.
If any skeptics think I am overstating the case dont take my
word for it.
Go to
www.victoryfortheworld.net and
read some of the books that can be used as references. A hundred
pages of The Web of Debt, for example, setting out the history
of money, will probably be enough to make you sick at your
stomach. I stopped reading it at night because if often made me
so angry I couldnt sleep.
I entered politics more than 60 years ago because I thought
recessions were quite unnecessary. They were monetary phenomena
with a relatively easy fix. I have made hundreds of speeches on
the subject and convinced a few thousand people. But never the
movers and shakers. And the mainline press were less than
helpful.
They were so jaundiced that they
were not interested in a maverick speaking truth to power. So it
was always a case of David vs. Goliath, to use a Biblical
analogy.
Now, for the first time, the power exists to turn the tables and
go for the jugular.
The internet is providing power to the
people that they have never enjoyed before. The young people of
the world, in concert with the thousands of their parents and
others who care about the state of the world can use the power
of social networking to effect a miracle on their own behalf and
that of succeeding generations.
The
valiant people of Tunisia and Egypt have shown the way by
achieving what was believed to be impossible. We share their
euphoria. At the same time they, and we, must acknowledge that
it is only the beginning. Real freedom will only be possible
when they have escaped from the tyranny of international banks,
and Wall Street is no longer able to manipulate the price of
their daily bread.
A good start might be to distribute a million copies of this
speech and translate it into a number of languages. Then the
rising generation can bombard the barricades through their
social networks.
Regime change is not necessary
except for leaders who refuse to see the light. But concerned
citizens of the world should band together and rattle the cages
of all federal politicians. Tell them bluntly that they must
vigorously support the above agenda or face inevitable defeat at
the next election. It is a simple message, but the only one they
understand.
At a press conference on March 29, 2001 announcing the U.S. was
backing out of the Kyoto Protocol, President
George W. Bush
said,
A friend is someone who tells
you the truth.
That is what I have been doing
today.
It is a message of global hope for
every race, color, religion and nationality in the world and of
peaceful relations with visitors from other realms.
