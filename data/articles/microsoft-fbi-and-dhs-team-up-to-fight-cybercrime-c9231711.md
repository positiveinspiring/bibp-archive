Microsoft admitted that they were
reading emails
of a targeted user because of allegations that this
"blogger" might be in possession of a leaked
version of Windows 8; as
well as documentation that was proprietary.
Microsoft stated:
"As part of the
investigation, we took the step of a limited review of this third
partys Microsoft operated accounts. While Microsofts terms of service
make clear our permission for this type of review, this happens only in
the most exceptional circumstances."
The unidentified target is purported to have received the Windows 8
leak via a Hotmail account.
Steven Sinofsky, former chief of operations at Windows altered the
Microsoft Trustworthy Computing Investigations department (TWCI) which
began the surveillance process and reading the targets emails without
foreknowledge.
Microsofts online services
privacy statement
allows for the corporation to,
"access or disclose
information about you, including the content of your communications" in
order to "protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers,
including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your
use of the Service."
The target,
Alex Kibkalo, formerly was employed by Microsofts
Lebanon satellite office
where alleged,
"leaked snippets of code belonging to an unreleased
operating system" were sent to the blogger "after receiving a bad
performance report."
In 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and Microsoft
teamed up to thwart a network of
cybercriminals called the Citadel.
The official codename of the mission, operation b54, was,
"part of a growing proactive effort by both the public and private
sector to fight cybercrime, help protect people and businesses from
online fraud and identity theft, and enhance cloud security for
everyone."
Microsoft stated that Citadel was,
"our most aggressive botnet
operation to date" and that this was the first time the FBI,
inter-policing agencies and Microsoft had "worked together... to
execute a civil seizure warrant as part of a botnet disruption
operation."
Proud of their accomplishment, Microsoft
heralded themselves as stopping Citadel and,
"more than a thousand botnets
that are responsible for stealing peoples online banking information
and personal identities."
This band of hackers had installed keystroke recording software to
steal data from an estimated 5 million computers.
In as little as 18 months, Citadel is
believed to have stolen $500 million from countries like,
-
the US
-
Europe
-
Hong Kong
-
India
-
Australia
Microsoft and the FBI coordinated with law enforcement agencies in 80
countries to protect technological and financial corporations.
Microsoft has joined forced with various internet service providers
(ISPs) and Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT). Microsofts relationship with the federal government runs deep.
Microsoft Lync is communicative software that
helps the
Department of Defense (DoD) and other military branches
use chat, multimedia conference or voice channels.
Microsoft System Center (MSC) is a collection of products that have,
"the ability to manage and monitor the full, heterogeneous spectrum of
[the federal] agencys software and hardware."
Grant funding from the DHS has been provided to Microsoft for,
"support technology training programs ranging from learning basic
computer skills to using advanced business productivity applications."
Tom Richey, 2004 head of security efforts for Microsoft,
explained that they have,
"had decades-long relationships with the agencies
that currently now make up the Department of Homeland Security.
The goal of the relationship between DHS and
Microsoft has been to assist in the development of technology to help
detect, prevent, and deter terrorist activity in both small and large
cities - linking everyone from the top intelligence official to the cop
on the street - in a worldwide effort to stay one step ahead of those
who threaten America."
Richey said:
"Microsoft Homeland Security has
developed an actionable roadmap to align with the goals of the
Department of Homeland Security - to build a National Response
System over the next 10 years, which is an objective set by (former)
Secretary Tom Ridge."
