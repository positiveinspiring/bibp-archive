Goodbye to Europe as a High-Ranking Power
Even before it began, Europe's moment as a major world power in the 21st century looks to be
over
by Richard N. Haass

Summary
Through crises to the peaks - this seems to be
EU's strategy: In every crisis - and most of them were created by EU's
masterminds - the EU grabs more power over us, and especially over our
money.
As the chief of staff at the White House says
you should never let a severe crisis (that they have taken so much pain to
create - real or imaginary) go to waste. The EU Commission certainly does
not. It glee is very audible now because everyone will accept the EU to have
more power to save the planet.
Maybe the syndicate, however, has made a
miscalculation:
President Obama directed the lacing of the EU's bail-out for
the Euro group's weaker countries - thereby sweeping aside EU's new
permanent President, Van Rompuy, who recently declared that 2009 was the
first year of world governance.
Chancellor Merkel and Barroso are now shouting
for what is actually the United States of Europe - and without the dangerous
referendums. The EU Commission will censor the budgets of EU countries' -
possibly reject them before they are allowed to be presented to National
parliaments.
Now union proposals are teeming:
All Community
sentences should circulate and be applicable in all EU countries. Refugee
policy is to be aligned - Southern Europe's many Muslim refugees are to be
jointly distributed everywhere.
The Eurogendarmerie,
Eurogendfor, will
deploy French troops to defeat expected mass demonstrations in Germany - and
Germans to defeat protesting Frenchmen, etc. They are now holding
corresponding maneuvers.
The Icelandic ash cloud was used by the EU to usurp
dominion over our sovereign airspaces - in spite of its demonstrated
tremendous incompetence.
Huge extra taxes are coming to us:
financial
transaction taxes, huge CO2 taxes besides already existing ones.
Merkel, Barroso and Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Möller definitely want to play
a major power and subjugate the world militarily for the
New World Order -
and appear to their masterminds to be big boys and girls. One can wonder
about the EU's commitment to such insane actions.
But it is now apparent that EU commissioners who
have been loyal to the New World Order ideology and program, get cool
corporative posts, when they are finished.
This interaction between
corporations and rulers was defined as fascism by Mussolini.
Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff
You never want a serious crisis to go to
waste. And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things you think
you could not do before.
Take a look too, at the following videos:
See and hear in above videos, Mr. Barroso, Sarkozy, Gordon brown
vying with Pres.
Bush Sr. and
Henry Kissinger demanding Weishaupt/Rothschild's
communist New World Order/world government.
Like children before Christmas, they cannot wait for the fulfillment of this nightmare. So what are they
doing to achieve it? They are creating crises and using each of them to
promote their silly slogan global solutions to global problems - the EU
Parliament working for a UN Parliamentary Assembly to govern the
regionalized world.
And
the sheeple believe them and gladly accept
their saving the planet - although they really loot and enslave us with
every crisis they make.
It is later than we may think:
According to EU Pres. van Rompuy 2009 was the first year of global governance, which he has now
experienced, as Pres.
Obama took leadership in the planning of
the
Euro-bail-out away from him.

Now the EU has created a bail-out for Greece
(110 bn Euro) and for the the
PIIGS countries (750 bn Euro).
Nevertheless, the markets (read
Rothschild/Soros) have serious
concerns: These countries are trapped, will have to take more loans to
repay their debts - and finally end up in insolvency.
These big loans
will stall the consumption of these countries - and of Germany too, all
of them having to introduce austerity measures. Some fear a double dip
in the Euro zone.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on
Thursday the Euro's troubles offered a chance for the EU to strengthen
its economic and political union, not just its common currency.
"If the Euro fails, not only the currency fails. Europe fails too, and the idea
of European unification. We have a common currency, but no common
political and economic union. And this is exactly what we must change.
To achieve this - therein lies the opportunity of this
crisis."
After the common currency, we may venture further steps, such as the
joint move towards a European army.

"Let us be clear: in the past, some national
politicians have resisted stronger mechanisms of governance" in
Brussels, Jose Manuel Barroso.
"I hope that
all EU (national)
governments will now recognize the need for full ownership of Europe
2020 and for a truly coordinated and coherent action in economic
policy."
Greece easily represents "a turning-point in the history of
monetary union.
The problem, as ever, is one of "the transfer of sovereignty" from
national capitals to Brussels, Belgium's Finance Minister Didier Reynders said on Friday.

The Maastricht rules - limiting member
states to an annual budget deficit of 3 per cent a year and an overall
national debt to a GDP ratio of 60 per cent - were swept away during the
financial crisis.

The EU is to be made a more successful
foreign policy player, which can give the U.S. and China an equal fight.
Foreign Minister Per Stig Møller sets this out at an EU summit in
Brussels.
We have a huge amount of military, if we only used it.
The
Foreign Minister is in no doubt that the EU is to have a much larger
global role, so that the union becomes a respected actor around the
world.
-
Why do people talk about the G2 - the U.S. and China?
-
Why not
talk of the G3 - the United States, China and Europe?
Of course, foreign
policy is still sovereign, but when the
Lisbon Treaty comes through we
can become much better at having Europe placed in the global
negotiations than we have been.
Comment:
Do I hear Napoleon, or an
elected Danish Foreign minister?

War on Terror:

The plan to turn
Eurojust, an existing body
based on non-binding judicial co-operation, into an investigator, with
the power to order arrests and trials, is the first step to creating an
EU public prosecutor.
The Commission's proposals welcome the entry into
force of the Lisbon Treaty as allowing "greater ambition" in giving the EU new justice and policing powers to sweep aside national "obstacles to
effective law enforcement".
Key to the EU ambitions to forge a "solid common European
procedural base" are new proposals, to give,
"Eurojust powers to directly
initiate investigations", Tony Bunyan, of the European Civil Liberties
Network (ECLN), "We are seeing EU agencies becoming institutions in
their own right without open debate."
Other Commission proposals tabled on Tuesday will lead to a European ID
card register, internet surveillance systems and automated EU exit-entry
border systems operated by machines reading fingerprints.
"These
policies are evidence of dangerous authoritarian tendencies within the EU," said Mr Bunyan.

Immigration. Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmström identified asylum seekers'
rights and seasonal workers' rules as the two main priorities in terms
of immigration.
Malmström will pledge to foster a burden-sharing mechanism.
"Europeans must act together to deal
with immigration and asylum policies," writes Commission
Vice-President Viviane Reding, in charge of justice, and home
affairs.
Now it turns out that a long line of leftist
Danish top politicians, whose parties have declared they want to change
our society radically through massive Muslim immigration - and they
themselves have been scolding citizens who send their children to
private schools with no Muslims, even threatened to deprive just such
schools of their state subventions - are sending their own children to
private schools without Muslims!!!
In 2011, the Commission will start,
"to review the member states' national
asylum systems and identify the issues related to capacities which
will enable member states to support each other in building
capacity".
A new proposal on the "joint processing of
asylum applications," aimed at enforcing mutual recognition of refugees'
rights, will not be presented until 2014.

Military exercise as for counter-insurgency
against the peoples by French and German security forces at
Toul-Rosières.
The exercise topic is the simulation of violent actions
on both sides of the border as part of a mass demonstration. It was
frankly posted on May 4, 2010 written on the site that that they
are preparing police for mass riots, demonstrations and protests of the
populations with a bilateral exercise of special security forces from
both countries, France and Germany, on May 6.
With the Department of State riot police headquarters of the Saarland,
the forces of the Compagnies Republicaine de Sécurité (CRS) from
Thionville, Metz and Jarville will for the first time train a
common interaction changing the subordination of practice on neighborly
territory.
This means that during civil unrest in France, French
demonstrators will be fought by Eurogendfor German police - and French
elite units will be used by the German Government for the suppression of
mass protests in Germany - and so on all over Europe.
The
Eurogendfor
may have the right to kill demonstrators.
Taxes
The Telegraph
7 Apr. 2010
Last month, Jose Manuel Barroso, EU
president, pledged to ask world leaders to impose a special tax on banks
(the proposal of Rothschild's minion,
George Soros).
AFP reports support
for a global financial transaction tax is growing within the German
Christian Democrat party, Merkel being against it.
AFP publishes data showing that the
financial transaction tax would raise 321.3 billion per year in Europe
(which we shall have to pay). A tax on leverage, borrowing and
risk-taking could raise 50bn.
CO2taxes: In the UKalone the Climate Act
costs 18 bn a year.
Then there are the climate exchanges, where
CO2 is being sold like shares - costing us enormously much via our
energy bills and fees. CO2 mitigating redistribution of our wealth to
those LDCs who never will rise above their present levels out of thin
air for harmless, life spending CO2. Besides, rising to
100bn dollars a year from 2020.
The CO2 tax required to bring emissions
down to the levels demanded by
the IPCC would reduce global GDP by an
amount that would equate - in 2100 - to $40
trillion (£25 trillion) a year.
All as agreed upon by our elite at the
Bilderberg Meeting 2005 (Daniel Estulin was there).

"The choice we face is therefore clear:
build on the strengths of the EU and use its collective weight to become
an assertive and relevant player in the world, or cultivate
fragmentation and contemplate the possibility of absolute decline in a
world where the rules are defined by those who matter," the report says.
"Project Europe 2030":
"Above all, the situation calls for strong
political leadership. The report calls for both a long-term vision on
European defense and a common European strategic concept. Politicizing
and engaging EU citizens could be achieved by allowing, under certain
conditions, nationals of other member states to vote in national
elections."
The Global Warming Lie
Control of European air space
The Icelandic volcano plume was used by the EU to create panic in order
to make it clear to the public that such global problems require global
solution - although
the EU showed a maximum of ineptitude to deal with
the plume.
Comment
The EU will absolutely become a superpower - thereby - like all superpowers
- sacrifice us for their private ambitions which the peoples of Europe do
not share.
Their demagogical vision that they and the EU
can play a role in the world by its own force reminds of what Hitler said -
but is another lie: Not even
Obama plays an independent role: The leaders of
the world are all
Rothschild's puppets.
Why should the EU play a role in dominating the world - not just Europe. Why
is the top priority of the illuminist EU (explanatory statement) endless
expansion?
I see no other reason than the one offered by
David Rockefeller's and
Zbigniew Brzezinski' little known
Trilateral
Commission:
About the Trilateral Commission:
It was
formed in 1973 by private citizens of Japan, Europe (European Union
countries), and North America Corruption (United States and Canada) to
foster closer cooperation among these core democratic industrialized
areas of the world with shared leadership responsibilities in the wider
international system.
There was a sense that the United States was
no longer in such a singular leadership position as it had been in
earlier post-World War II years, and that a more shared form of
leadership - including Europe and Japan in particular - would be needed
for the international system to navigate successfully the major
challenges of the coming years
The growing interdependence that so
impressed the founders of the Trilateral Commission in the early 1970s
has deepened into globalization.
That interdependence also has ensured
that the current financial crisis has been felt in every nation and
region. As our conviction has strengthened that the Commission remains
more important than ever in helping our countries fulfill their shared
leadership responsibilities in the wider international system, we too
have changed.
Our membership has widened to reflect
broader changes in the world. Thus, the Japan Group has become a Pacific
Asian Group, including in 2009 both Chinese and Indian members. Mexican
members have been added to the North American Group. The European Group
continues to widen in line with the enlargement of the EU (and is
engaged in the Mediterranean Union).
We are also continuing in this triennium our
practice of inviting a number of participants from other key areas.
From this we see that this private club has the
audacity to take elitist non-elected world government in secrecy by forming
a belt around the globe, governed by politicians and and business people,
i.e. what Mussolini called fascism.
The EU wants to play a big role in promoting
this agenda.
Why? The Commissioners are thinking about their income after their time in
office - doing what ever they can to play into the hands of the vested
interests of corporations behind the TC:
EurActiv

Transparency International, an international
NGO which fights corruption, expressed "strong concern" after four
former commissioners in the Barroso I executive had accepted positions
in the private sector.
Benita Ferrero-Waldner of Austria, who held
the external relations portfolio in the,
-
Barroso I Commission
-
Germany's
Günter Verheugen (enterprise and industry)
-
Ireland's Charlie McCreevy
(internal market)
-
Bulgaria's Meglena Kuneva (consumer protection),
...assumed corporate jobs.
The companies involved may profit from the
former roles of their new employees. The EU is as
corrupt as
ever it
was.
