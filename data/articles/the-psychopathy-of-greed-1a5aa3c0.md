I always find it interesting that people blame corporate greed for our overall condition. Sure it's a major factor at one level, but it's just an obvious outcropping of something much, much deeper.
Sadly not that many are willing to go there... That the entire world system is built on a capitalist system in one form or another is mind boggling. Defying our innate conscious awareness to the contrary, the signal has been given and repeatedly endorsed as well as crassly promoted that we need to gain off of each other, in each and every transaction, every exchange, in a no holds barred, dog eat dog environment. One look at the marketing world and you get the picture. And the supposed "fittest" come out on top. This is how and why the populace acquiesces to domination by the few.
"They're just good at what they do. They're smarter and more motivated than the rest of us so surely they deserve to be winners in the game."
Humanity's being told how the game works and that this is your only option.
"It's just the way it is, so get to work and earn your salary, then invest in the game and try to get ahead and make a name and lots of money for yourself."
At which point the sharks devour the unsuspecting guppy. Group absolved endemic greed doesn't make it right, however justified, by any stretch of the imagination.
The Corporate "Growth" Model It's fully accepted that corporations need to grow.
For their good, for our good, or so we're told. It's a fear based econo-survivalist psychological scam. Who says they need to constantly make more, for their investors' interests or otherwise?
Yet this is considered healthy in a capitalistic system, under the guise of increased jobs and benefits and a prosperous economy.
Do the employees really benefit? Do the consumers who go increasingly into debt trying to catch the materialist carrot benefit? Who really benefits?
Do the employees really benefit?
Do the consumers who go increasingly into debt trying to catch the materialist carrot benefit?
Who really benefits?
Yet this model is accepted carte blanche as a driving force for a 'healthy economy.'
If you stand back to think about it outside of all this financial gibberish it's completely destructive, enslaving insanity for the good of the few. And yet this model is mimicked as if it's the paradigm of truth through every level of Pavlovian entrained economic and interpersonal commerce engagement.
Getting to the Root of the Problem The entire system is built on a background of assumed scarcity, that there's not enough to go around so unless you push and shove your way into a place where you "earn" your keep and beat those around you you'll be hung out to dry. Clever bastards. All while they sit at the top of the food chain devouring their prey. What's even more surreal is how those who "succeed" in making a lot of money are then considered authorities on any and every subject.
Just look the Rockefeller family, one such cluster-fuck among many, screwing their way up the capitalist ladder who then set up think tanks, foundations and whatnot to influence the course of humanity according to their whims. What or who made them the "wise ones" to rule over us? Guess what: Endorsed greed, abject avarice and the resultant intoxicating money and power in the hands of a few. Look at creeps like George Soros or Bill Gates and a plethora of other unelected plutocrats, inserted intellectuals and accepted moral and geopolitical authorities like the Pope, lap dog Kissinger or voice pet Brzezinski and the panorama of puppet heads of state.
It's insane...
Never mind the,

...or whomever is hoarding the really big bucks. The message is the same:
in their minds we and our world are owned.
And they aren't sharing nothing with the rest of us.
Why? Apparently we don't deserve it. Do you like that fate and outcome? "Everyone else is accepting it, so it must be OK" reasons the stilted servant.

Greed - A Name You Can Trust You've all heard the outlandish statistics about how few have so much in this world.
Yet it is by and large accepted by quiet submission, incredible as that may seem. The problem is humanity's acquiescence to a rigged system.
While the wealth of some of these bloodline families, banking moguls and mega rich corporate thugs could feed the poor of the earth many times over, they sit on their booty and only get more oppressive. This brings us to the psychopathy of greed, amongst many other issues.
Greed is insatiable. It is a vampiristic dynamic. It only sucks and is never satisfied. Wealth soon takes a back seat to power and control, their ultimate aphrodisiac. This is what it all leads to.
And this reptilian, archontic urge is never satisfied, it always wants more. At any cost to the hosts of these parasites. The issue is that psychopathy, especially in positions of power, is not just rampant but so readily accepted. That's where the problem exponentially compounds. This is the heartbreaking aspect to all of this, how humanity has bought into their program and replicates these unnatural urges at every level of society, which of course their system is designed to do.
And while the masses abuse each other in this same lower vibrational parasitic frequency, no one is conscious enough to realize their oppressive trendsetters are feeding off of all of humanity by the very meme they've put into place. If people woke up to that one fact we'd have an overnight revolution of disengagement causing a massive resetting of how society should and could cooperate.
Conclusion - The 5 Step Program Parasitic forces build parasitic institutions, and encourage the same in others while maintaining their dominance.
Be it corporatism, capitalism, communism and socialism, fractional banking or base line competition for resources and day to day needs, this system is rigged to the core. Agreeing to help foment this dog eat dog mentality under the guise of survival or "rightful competition" only perpetrates the problem. To become free and help build the better world we know exists requires conscious disconnection with this systemic disease. It begins in both small and big steps.
But the underlying propellant towards change is identifying the problem for what it is.
A parasitic disease, promulgated by those who stand to gain, and realizing their mindset is a pathological, direly destructive one that seeks to exert its twisted idea of oligarchical as well as personal control at any expense.
Step Up
First, do your part. Realize what is transpiring before your eyes, no matter how horrid it may first appear. Second, disengage. In any and every way possible. Just take steps in that direction and the mounting freedom it engenders will empower you to take the next step. Third, tell others - like a house afire. Use wisdom but never hold back. The hour is late as they are entering their last phases of implementable programs and are getting desperate to throttle humanity's awakening. Fourth - stand strong in your convictions. Feed those convictions, strengthen them, and encourage the same in others, as the mainstream of society is a nasty polluted river we must avoid, resist, oppose and most of all penetrate and reverse with everything in us. Fifth - Stand fast in your convictions. Live a life committed to your newfound awakened understanding fearlessly. This presence of awakened individuals does more than we'll ever know.

See greed for what it is, but most of all don't comply with their fabricated hierarchical world of abuse.
It's fraudulent, manipulative, destructive and a de facto form of voluntary enslavement. See the world for what it has become. But more importantly, see the world as it should be and operate within that paradigm.
Their fabricated world of lies will then crumble at our feet...
