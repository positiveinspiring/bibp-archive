# What is The NSA's Utah Data Center - Safety or Surveillance?

BLUFFDALE
One of the biggest and most mysterious
construction projects in Utah history is roughly halfway completed near the
Point of the Mountain.
It's a vast computer center for one of the
nation's most secretive agencies,
the National Security Agency.
Critics joke that NSA really stands for "Never
Say Anything." The secrecy surrounding the project has led to speculation it
will become a vast storehouse of personal communications of average
Americans.
The facility is 1 million square feet of space,
with a price tag well above $1 billion; and it will have an appetite for
electricity that would embarrass Godzilla. Computers and cooling systems at
the NSA's Utah Data Center will reportedly consume
$40 million worth
of power each year.
The power company won't say if that widely
reported estimate is valid.
"The information about customer use is
private and so even if I knew, I wouldn't be able to tell you," said
Dave Eskelsen, spokesman for Rocky Mountain Power.
Officials in Washington won't say what the data
center is for, but the NSA did issue a vague statement saying it will,
"strengthen and protect the nation's
cyber-security."
That's a critical mission, according to NSA
director General Keith Alexander.
"Whether it's a nation-state or a hacker,
somebody who finds a vulnerability in our infrastructure could cause
tremendous problems," Alexander said.
But a Washington whistleblower says that's just
a cover story for a serious threat to civil liberties.
William Binney worked for the NSA for 32
years. He still lives by the highly secure headquarters near Baltimore. Binney led a
team in the 1990s that developed software designed to sort through
mountains of electronic data.
It could slice and dice billions of
emails, phone calls and Internet records, looking for clues to terrorist
plots. But Binney's team built into the software sophisticated protections
so that communications by U.S. citizens would be protected from NSA
snooping.
When the NSA passed over his system, Binney
retired in anger, right after the attack on the World Trade Center.
"It didn't take but probably
a week or so after 9/11 that they decided to start
spying on the U.S. domestically, on all U.S. citizens
they could get," Binney said.
He now suspects the facility in Bluffdale will
be used to store incredible amounts of communication data so the NSA can
sift through it, whether it's from foreign terrorists or law-abiding U.S.
citizens.
Emails, cellphone calls, Google searches; Binney
calculated how much data such a huge facility could hold.
"That means at Bluffdale, if you divide it
out, you could get 5 zetabytes," he said.
That's an incredible number that most of us
can't really understand, but Binney gave an idea of what it means.
"(It) pretty much means all the
communications in the world, for roughly a hundred years," he said.
Last summer, Gen. Alexander denied the thrust of
Binney's accusations, calling the idea that they store data on U.S. citizens
"baloney."
But in Senate testimony, FBI chief Robert
Mueller recently revealed a new capability, searching "past emails,"
implying mass storage somewhere. Binney says his contacts inside NSA told
him about surveillance of U.S. citizens.
Alexander did preserve the NSA's traditional
cone of silence.
"Now, I'm not going to come out and say
here's what we're doing at Utah," he said. "That would be ridiculous,
too, because it'll give our adversaries a tremendous advantage."
NSA's past controversial
surveillance activity
No matter whom you believe about the Utah
facility, the NSA's secretive activities have stirred up serious controversy
in recent years, particularly electronic surveillance without warrants.
A highly classified operation of the NSA jumped
into the headlines during the
Bush administration and remains
controversial today.
The veil of secrecy was pierced in 2005 when the
New York Times revealed that NSA had been conducting wire-tapping, without
warrants, on a widespread scale.
That revelation touched off a fierce debate
in Washington, D.C., over the rights of
citizens - what the law is and what the law should be.
In 2008, Congress amended the law, authorizing
much of what the Bush administration was already doing:
surveillance of communications by suspected
terrorists, without warrants.
Under the law, Americans cannot be targeted, but
if they're on the other end of a conversation with a foreign suspect, the
NSA can listen in without a warrant.
That revised law is strongly opposed by civil
libertarians.
"We don't want the government to be able to
have access without any basis for suspicion, to read all our emails, to
listen in on our phone calls," said Sharon Bradford Franklin, with the
Constitution Project.
"That's not the kind of place that this
country is. That's not what our Constitution is about."
But
warrantless surveillance has bipartisan
support in Congress, which is considering extending the law up to five more
years. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told KSL News that it
works well at "ferreting out terrorists."
Republican Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona,
agreed.
"Every one of our intelligence leaders, both
in this and previous administrations, view it as a vital element,"
McCain said. "We still have an enemy out there that's plotting to attack
America.
"When people start to think, 'If my entire
life were being watched, and being watched by government agents who
might then collect a file on me,' many more people would start to feel
uncomfortable with that," Bradford Franklin said.
But is that what will really go on at
Bluffdale's huge new complex, once the computers and data servers start
humming?
Frankly, we don't know because it's all a big
secret...
