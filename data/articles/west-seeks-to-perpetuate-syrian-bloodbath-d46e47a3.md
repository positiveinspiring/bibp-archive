Note: Much of this report is
based on James Corbett's recent presentation, "R2P or: How the Left Learned
to Stop Worrying and Embrace Wars of Imperial Aggression."
Even with violence ebbing across Syria as order is restored, Kofi Annan is
still attempting to peddle a "peace deal" between the Syrian government and
militants - demanding Syrian troops be withdrawn from cities just recaptured
from terrorist forces.
And as Annan seeks a reprieve for remaining militant forces, the West is
meeting in neighboring Turkey, devising a method to rearm and redeploy them
in order to reignite and perpetuate the bloodshed they claim they are trying
to prevent.
More specifically, BBC reports in their article titled, "Syria crisis debated at Istanbul talks,"
that ways are being "explored" to "step up pressure on the Syrian regime
and bolster the opposition."
The report also makes mention of calls to arm
the opposition.
There is also funding being given by the West
and the Arab League to
literally "pay" terrorist to get back into the fight.
Surely, placing pressure on a government that has just restored order across
the country, while "bolstering" and arming the opposition will only trigger
yet another round of bloodshed and violence.
Indeed
the entire premise of the "Responsibility to Protect (R2P)" doctrine
follows that if a nation is incapable of providing protection for its own
population, it relinquishes its sovereignty to direct intervention by the
"international community."
Should such a nation manage to restore order,
however, the R2P doctrine along with the meddling it justifies and the
window for regime change it opens no longer applies.
Knowing this, and realizing the window for
forcing regime change in Syria is closing, the West is actually seeking ways
to perpetuate the bloodbath, not end it, until their objective of removing
President Bashar al-Assad has been achieved - revealing in incredible detail
the insidious nature of the so-called "humanitarian" R2P model.
This includes foreign-funding to create proxy opposition movements within
targeted nations, training, equipping, and funding mobs of protesters to sow
unrest, providing covert military support to ensure the survival of these
proxy movements, and a series of financial and economic measures, including
sanctions used to poison the will of a nation's people against their
government and foster division within ruling parties.
Essentially, the violence that then predictably
unfolds is cited as justification to intervene more overtly and ensure
regime change is accomplished and a series of neo-liberal reforms
instituted.
Setting the Stage for
R2P in Syria
Years before unrest unfolded in Syria, the West had determined it would
overthrow its government and replace it with a suitable client regime.
In 2002, Syria was
officially added to America's "Axis of
Evil," and according to US Army General Wesley Clark (below video)
during a 2007 speech, was one of many Arab regimes targeted for regime
change:
As early as 2001 -
R2P "doctrine" was being devised to use conditions
of violent unrest as a pretext to intervene militarily in a any given
nation, destroy it politically as well as literally, then rebuild a
neo-liberal, globalist client state upon the rubble.
As early as 2008, the
US State Department
began training armies of "activists" to then be sent
back to their respective nations across the Arab World and induce violent
unrest.
In an
April 2011 AFP report, Michael Posner, the assistant US Secretary of
State for Human Rights and Labor, stated that the,
"US government has
budgeted $50 million in the last two years to develop new technologies to
help activists protect themselves from arrest and prosecution by
authoritarian governments."
The report went on to explain that the US,
"organized training sessions for 5,000
activists in different parts of the world. A session held in the Middle
East about six weeks ago gathered activists from Tunisia, Egypt, Syria
and Lebanon who returned to their countries with the aim of training
their colleagues there."
Posner would add,
"They went back and there's a ripple effect.
That ripple effect of course is the 'Arab Spring,' and in Syria's case,
the impetus for the current unrest threatening to unhinge the nation and
invite in foreign intervention" using the R2P model.
R2P -DOA
Despite years of preparing R2P to become an institutionalized mechanism for
quickly justifying and executing regime change, almost immediately when it
was first rolled out against Libya, it was met with resistance, skepticism,
and criticism.
Claims of peaceful protesters being brutalized
by Qaddafi's troops quickly collapsed as it became known these "protesters"
were heavily armed terrorists hailing from the US State Department
listed
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG). Instead of carrying placards as
the corporate-media suggested, they were brandishing machines guns, driving
tanks, and even at one point piloting fighter jets.
Despite the obvious inconsistencies with the alleged narrative "justifying"
R2P and the realities unfolding on the ground, the West through its military
alliance NATO began its military intervention to "protect civilians."
NATO's military campaign from the beginning,
however, did not "protect civilians," but instead provided air support for
rebel assaults, intelligence and special operations assistance to rebel
military units, and carried the systematic targeting and destroying of
Qaddafi's political inner circle - which included bombing the homes of
Qaddafi's family, killing his children and his grandchildren in NATO
airstrikes.
Toward the end of the campaign, NATO assisted rebels in besieging Libyan
cities, including Bani Walid and Sirte.
This included
shutting off water, electricity,
food, and aid and literally starving out city residence while NATO pounded
them from the air until they capitulated. In the case of Sirte, the city
fought until the bitter end leaving absolute desolation.
Other cities targeted included Tawarga in which
the entire population of 10,000 was either exterminated or permanently
exiled.
The desolate Libyan city of
Sirte
after NATO's months-long
siege - the tragic aftermath
of a UN-sanctioned
"humanitarian war."
Clearly NATO made a cruel mockery out of the
"Responsibility to Protect" doctrine, using it to visit catastrophic horrors
upon the Libyan people, overturning a unifying national government, plunging
the entire nation into division and chaos - where now
bands of genocidal
racists roam the country carrying out horrific and systematic atrocities
while other armed militias battle each other daily as the nation is carved
up into
competing fiefdoms.
The government in Tripoli installed by NATO
after the fall of Qaddafi is currently headed by BP, Shell, and Total-funded
Petroleum Institute chairman Abdurrahim el-Keib.
Before el-Keib even came to power, provisional
rebel leaders had already begun
pawning off national assets to French,
Qatari, British, and American corporations.
Syria's Turn
Any doubt that R2P was a contrived geopolitical ploy designed solely to veil
the hegemonic ambitions of globalist oligarchs was laid to rest in the
rubble of Libya's grotesque dismemberment.
And despite this doctrine's legitimacy
collapsing, it has been quickly arrayed against Syria next. As in Libya,
Syria's "protesters" are in fact a mix of armed Syrian militants, foreign
fighters, and terrorists provided a constant torrent of weapons and funding
from NATO and its junior partners amongst the Arab League.
The unrest purposefully stoked by the West to put R2P options "on the table"
is
coordinated with the corporate media which spins the chaos in a lopsided
fashion, portraying the violence as the Syrian government callously
"slaughtering civilians":
Classic war
propaganda - complete with staged-gunfire off camera and
the intrepid actor "Danny" relaxed and joking before
getting into character to give a hysterical "casualty
report" to his co-star, CNN's Anderson Cooper - just one
of many he regularly gives to Western media networks.
Such tactics
have already been used and exposed
during the Libyan war, and like R2P itself seem to be collapsing upon their
tenuous foundations.
And despite all of this, there are still calls for R2P in Syria. One article
out of the Christian Science Monitor titled, "'Responsibility to protect':
the moral imperative to intervene in Syria," sees lawyer and former USAID
official James Rudolph lecture his audience as if talking to children about
the need to intervene in Syria, as if the last year of NATO-facilitated
atrocities in Libya didn't happen.
We are brought right back to the beginning, with
Western powers convening in Turkey faced with a Syrian government restoring
order and taking R2P options "off the table."
The lies used to sell R2P to the public, the lies still being used by the
likes of Rudolph in the Christian Science Monitor, begin to ring
particularly hallow as the West lays out plans to purposefully prolong the
bloody conflict in Syria.
The corporate-financier funded US policy
think-tank Brookings Institution in their Middle East Memo #21 "Assessing
Options for Regime Change", literally says in reference to arming Syrian
militants,
"alternatively, the United States might
calculate that it is still worthwhile to pin down the Asad regime and
bleed it, keeping a regional adversary weak, while avoiding the costs of
direct intervention."
Also out of the Brookings
Institution, Middle East Memo #21
"Assessing Options for Regime
Change"
makes no secret that
"responsibility to protect"
is but a pretext for
long-planned regime change.
The same Brookings Institution in another report
titled "Assessing Options for Regime Change" would admit Kofi Annan's
mission to Syria is not to broker a peace deal, but rather to facilitate the
establishment of "safe havens" from which the West's campaign of
destabilization can be continued:
An alternative is for diplomatic efforts to
focus first on how to end the violence and how to gain humanitarian
access, as is being done under Annans leadership.
This may lead to the creation of safe-havens
and humanitarian corridors, which would have to be backed by limited
military power. This would, of course, fall short of U.S. goals for
Syria and could preserve Asad in power.
From that starting point, however, it is
possible that a broad coalition with the appropriate international
mandate could add further coercive action to its efforts.

Not only is it obvious that Western leaders are
currently plotting in Turkey to carry out Brookings' directives, but also
that these goals, as they did in Libya, run contra to any conceivable
interpretation of the "Responsibility to Protect" doctrine.
When we consider that the 2001 document, "The
Responsibility to Protect," - published by the ad hoc "International
Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) - consisted of
members of,
...and members of both Western governments and
armed forces - the decade-arcing plot to disguise a global blitzkrieg of
naked military conquest as a series of "humanitarian interventions" becomes
painfully clear.
Some of the
corporate
sponsors behind the Brookings Institution,
from whose playbook Western
leaders are following
in their attempted overthrow
of Syria's government.
Just some of the
corporate
and "institutional" sponsors of the International Crisis Group,
whose membership provided
representatives
that helped develop the R2P
doctrine.
The very corporations behind the development of
the R2P doctrine allowing for the vicious dismemberment of Libya, are the
same corporations now plundering its wealth and preparing to role it into
their global hegemonic empire.
It seems Syria is next and the powers that be
are not concerned that their fig leaf of legitimacy has been take into the
wind. Beyond that, they eye the world - Africa, South America, Southeast
Asia, Russia and China and their peripheries - unless we as individuals
identify these corporations and find the resolve
to boycott and
permanently
replace them.
The power they've used to wreak havoc across the planet is a direct result
of we the people paying our monthly paychecks into their corporations and
institutions.
The key to undoing this unwarranted influence is
to stop feeding this monster our money, time, energy, and attention.
