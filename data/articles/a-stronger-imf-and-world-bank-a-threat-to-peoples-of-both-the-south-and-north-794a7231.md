North

The G-20, the self-proclaimed global regulation
authority, has decided to bolster the capacity of
the IMF and
the World Bank to siphon the wealth from
the South in order to solve the crisis in the North.
In an effort to conceal the ruthlessness of this
policy, at their Istanbul meeting the international institutions agreed to
give the IMF a new face while leaving intact the voting principles of its
General Assembly.
The leaders of the
CADTM (Committee for the Abolition of
the Third World Debt) denounce this consequential widening of world
imbalances.
Dominique Strauss Khan, Managing
Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
discusses with his
main constituent Timothy Geithner, US Secretary of the Treasury
(Istanbul, 3 October 2009).
The United States alone hold 16% of the voting
rights and,
together with their principal allies, easily
control the
institution.
The annual meetings of the IMF and of the World Bank in Istanbul ended in a
climate of repression.
For the second consecutive day, the 10,000 policemen
who had been called upon for the occasion used water cannons, tear gas and
tanks against demonstrators. The same scenario had been played out at the
G20 summit in Pittsburgh, where demonstrations against this G8 substitute
were also violently repressed by police forces.
The IMF and the WB held these controversial
meetings only days after the G20s decision to change the voting rights
within these two institutions:
5% of the IMF quotas and 3% of the voting
rights at the WB assembly are to be transferred to emerging and developing
countries by January 2011.
The current voting system was challenged both by
countries of the South and by social movements: it relies on the 1 dollar =
one vote rule, contrary to the UN General Assembly where each country has
only one vote.
For the IMFs Managing Director, the French socialist Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, these are historic decisions. Yet for CADTM, this is but a
grim joke. Indeed, this modification does not change the power relationships
within the two institutions at all. For instance, China, one of the main
beneficiaries of the change, now has about 3% of the voting rights, far
behind the United States, which holds over 16%, giving it de facto veto
power on all major decisions.
The Rwanda group, representing 24 Subsaharan
African countries and some 225 million people, holds 1.39 % of the voting
rights!
No need to be a keen mathematician to understand that these
media-hyped pseudo-reforms will not turn the IMF and the WB into democratic
organizations. Can they ever become democratic considering that the present
system cannot be changed without the USs consent?
To make things worse, since 1944, according to a
tacit agreement, the WBs President has always been a US citizen while the
director of the IMF has always been a European. Such power-sharing combined
with a deeply antidemocratic allocation of voting rights is evidence that
the IMF and the WB are tools in the hands of Western powers in order to
impose self-serving policies upon the rest of the world.
After a severe crisis of legitimacy the WB and the IMF have been given a new
lease of life thanks to
the global crisis. From 2004 to 2008, a significant
rise in commodity prices increased the currency reserves of some developing
countries, which could then repay their debts to these creditors in advance
and thus shake off their cumbersome guardianship.
But since the end of 2008, the global crisis has
radically changed the situation.
The list of badly hit countries keeps getting
longer and the G20 has restored the IMF and the WB as key actors in the
global game. Romania yielded to IMF pressure and implemented anti-welfare
policies such as a 15% cut in civil servants incomes, in order to receive a
loan to deal with short-term emergencies. The same has occurred in about
fifteen countries since 2008.
The World Bank has benefited from the
environment crisis by setting up several climate investment funds, though it
continues to finance deforestation and mining projects. Over the course of
2008, funds for clean energy were five times lower than those dedicated to
non-renewable energy, the amount of which rose by over 165%. [1]
Next, the G20, a self-proclaimed global regulation authority, played a
decisive part in the attempt to restore the IMFs legitimacy as it trebled
the resources made available to this institution at the London summit last
April [2] and enlarged its missions as an outcome of the
Pittsburgh Summit. [3] The IMF has thus been placed at the heart
of efforts to monitor the global economy to promote international
financial stability and to strengthen economic growth.
At the Istanbul summit it was decided to,
reassess the IMFs mandate to include all
macroeconomic policies and policies related to the financial industry
that influence global economic stability. It will thus have to
recommend economic policies to countries, which will have to take
adapted corrective measures.
Its easy to guess what the IMFs
recommendations will be...
In June 2009 the IMF commented on policies
implemented in the Euro zone:
measures taken to support shorter working
hours and raise social benefits - while important to shore up incomes and
keep the labour force attached to the labour marketshould have built-in
reversibility. [4]
The WB report Doing
Business 2010 is even more explicit since it warns countries
against social protection programs and calls governments that develop them
anti-competitive. [5]
In spite of its repeated failures, the
Washington Consensus, a kind of code for neoliberalism, still is the IMFs
and the WBs tall order to countries that ask for their help.
Yet the failure of structural adjustment policies implemented in countries
of the South since the 1982 debt crisis should have been sufficient to
censure them:
poverty and inequalities have grown while the issue of debt is
anything but solved. Worse still, a new crisis of debt is brewing, which
will increase the proportion of national budgets dedicated to repaying
creditors.
This will happen unless governments decide to
suspend payment so as to meet fundamental human needs and to launch a
large-scale audit of their debts in order to unconditionally cancel the
illegitimate portion of them, which did not benefit the people. An audit of
this kind would be a first and crucial challenge to the grizzly policies
enforced by the IMF and the WB.
We must now demand that they be replaced by
institutions that truly care for the peoples interests.
