Bankers committing suicide by jumping from the
rooftops of their own banks is something that we think of when we think of
the Great Depression.
Well, it just happened in London, England. A
vice president at JPMorgan's European headquarters in London plunged to his
death after jumping from the top of the 33rd floor.
He fell more than 500
feet, and it is being reported by an eyewitness that "there
was quite a lot of blood".
This comes on the heels of news that a former
Deutsche Bank executive was found hanged in his home in London on Sunday.
-
So why is this happening? Yes, the
markets have gone down a little bit recently but they certainly have
not crashed yet.
-
Could there be more to these deaths than
meets the eye? You never know.
And as I will discuss below, there have been a
lot of other really strange things happening around the world lately as
well.
But before we get to any of that, let's take a
closer look at some of these banker deaths.
The JPMorgan executive that jumped to his death
on Tuesday was named Gabriel Magee. He was 39 years old,
and his suicide has the city of London in shock...
A bank executive who died after jumping
500ft from the top of JP Morgan's European headquarters in London this
morning has been named as Gabriel Magee.
The American senior manager, 39, fell from
the 33-story skyscraper and was found on the ninth floor roof, which
surrounds the Canary Wharf skyscraper.
He was a vice president in the corporate and
investment bank technology department having joined in 2004, moving to
Britain from the United States in 2007.
What would cause a man in his prime working
years who is making huge amounts of money to do something like that?
The death on Sunday of former Deutsche Bank
executive Bill Broeksmit is also a mystery.
According to
the Daily Mail, police consider his death to be "non-suspicious", which
means that they believe that it was a suicide and not a murder...
A former Deutsche Bank executive has been
found dead at a house in London, it emerged today.
The body of William Bill Broeksmit, 58,
was discovered at his home in South Kensington on Sunday shortly after
midday by police, who had been called to reports of a man found hanging
at a house.
Mr Broeksmit - who retired last February -
was a former senior manager with close ties to co-chief executive Anshu
Jain. Metropolitan Police officers said his death was declared as
non-suspicious.
On top of that,
Business Insider is reporting that a communications director at another
bank in London was found dead last week...
Last week, a U.K.-based communications
director at Swiss Re AG died last week. The cause of death has not been
made public.
Perhaps it is just a coincidence that these
deaths have all come so close to one another. After all, people die all the time.
And London is rather dreary this time of the
year. It is easy for people to get depressed if they are not accustomed to
endless gloomy weather. If the stock market was already crashing, it would
be easy to blame the suicides on that.
The world certainly remembers what happened during
the crash of 1929...
Historically, bankers have been stereotyped
as the most likely to commit suicide. This has a lot to do with the
famous 1929 stock market crash, which resulted in 1,616 banks failing
and more than 20,000 businesses going bankrupt.
The number of bankers committing suicide
directly after the crash is thought to have been only around 20, with
another 100 people connected to the financial industry dying at their
own hand within the year.
But the market isn't crashing just yet. We
definitely appear to be at a "turning
point", but things are still at least somewhat stable.
So why are bankers killing themselves? That is a
good question.
As I mentioned above, there have also been quite
a few other strange things that have happened lately that seem to be "out of
place".
For example, Matt Drudge of
the Drudge Report posted the following cryptic message
on Twitter the other day...
"Have an exit plan..."
What in the world does he mean by that? Maybe
that is just a case of Drudge being Drudge.
Then again, maybe not...
And on Tuesday we learned that a prominent
Russian Bank
has banned all cash withdrawals until next week...
Bloomberg reports that
'My Bank' - one of Russia's top 200
lenders by assets - has introduced a complete ban on cash withdrawals
until next week. While the Ruble has been losing ground rapidly
recently, we suspect few have been expecting bank runs in Russia.
Yes, we have heard some reports of people having
difficulty getting money out of their banks around the world lately, but
this news out of Russia really surprised me.
Yet another story that seemed rather odd was a
report in
the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that stated that Germany's
central bank is advocating "a one-time wealth tax" for European nations that
need a bailout...
Germany's central bank Monday proposed a
one-time wealth tax as an option for euro-zone countries facing
bankruptcy, reviving a idea that has circled for years in Europe but has
so far gained little traction.
Why would they be suggesting such a thing if
"economic recovery" was just around the corner?
According to that same article, the IMF has
recommended a similar thing...
The International Monetary Fund in October
also floated the idea of a one-time "capital levy," amid a sharp
deterioration of public finances in many countries. A 10% tax would
bring the debt levels of a sample of 15 euro-zone member countries back
to pre-crisis levels of 2007, the IMF said.
So what does all of this mean?
I am not exactly sure, but I have got a bad
feeling about this - especially considering the financial chaos that we are
witnessing in emerging markets
all over the globe right now.
