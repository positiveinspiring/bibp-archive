Our era is largely defined by two highly
interlinked concepts: globalization and the so-called war on terrorism.
As geopolitical-economic operatives, both
concepts complement each other as significant means to specific ends; both
shape important aspects of our daily lives and determine form and content of
much that passes for public discourse.
Particularly in Europe and in the United States,
populations are kept vigilant to the clear and present dangers ostensibly
posed by international terrorism through mnemonic icons of troop movements
in Central Asia and/or strategically deployed bomb plots that are
purportedly thwarted just in time by our intelligence services.
As if copied from the lecture notes of Carl
Schmitt, a totalitarian enemy has been constructed which can conveniently
be called back into service at a moments notice should public memory begin
to fade.
Globalization has proceeded by means of three distinct but clearly
interwoven interpretations and representations of the world in toto: as the
sociopolitical cosmopolitan moment [1] (to borrow a term coined
by Seyla Benhabib) of the globe as the embodiment of our lifeworld; as the
stage of operations for multinational corporate/financial interests; and as
the battlefield on which incited conflicts are seen as requiring
comprehensive, global solutions which are to be achieved through a New World
Order.
In its current development, the construct of a
unified world is largely synonymous with the ideal world government as
envisioned in the Sociocracy of French philosopher Auguste Comte in the 19th
century [2], in which international bankers and elitest think
tanks determine and execute public policies.
Implied in this global ideal is of course the complete dissolution of the
nation-state as such through the gradual but de facto irreversible
integration of individual nations into the totalitarian framework of the
political, economic, and chief judicial/juridical entities operating on a
global scale (most significantly the
United Nations, the
International
Monetary Fund, the
World Bank, the
Bank for International Settlements, and
the World Trade Organization).
The philosophical roots of this integrative process can be found in the
determinant factors that led to the Treaty of Westphalia, which ended
Europes horrendously brutal Thirty Years War.
The treaty also buried the eius regio, quius
religio principle and reinstated the tolerance of Protestants as spelled
out in the Peace of Augsburg (1555), the revocation of which under the Holy
Roman Emperor Ferdinand II in the Edict of Restitution (1629) prompted the
vicious counter-response from Protestant nobility in Austria and Bohemia.
The terms of the peace accord also radically limited the territory and power
of the Holy Roman Empire and acknowledged the sovereignty of the many
principalities that constituted the realm of German influence, with France
and Sweden entrusted as guardians of the peace.
But the
Treaty of Westphalia was of major importance for one other
significant reason.
The councils of minds at Münster and Osnabrück
were able to establish through rational discourse the concept of a peace
accord based on the primacy of reason and rules of law that transcended
warring national interests and belief systems, effecting in a truly Kantian
sense the regulative idea of attainable peace as a principle of reason to
guide all actions of the parties involved, and to which all participants,
nolens volens, were to submit.
This is clearly evident in the way various
clauses in the treaty assumed a meta-normative role. The treaty thus paved
the way for an era of secularized thought in which the rule of law and
political negotiation served as instruments of conflict resolution and as
guidelines of national sovereignty based on principles of reason.
Parallel to the development of international principles of cosmopolitan
conduct in our own time such as those found in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and in the statutes of the Geneva Convention, economic and
financial interests have exploited both the judicial codices formulated in
international agreements and the juridical measures that now in many cases
supersede pre-existing national laws through increasingly totalitarian
bodies such as the World Trade Organization. [3]
It is the power embodied in the domains of
concentrated financial interests that today are in the process of
transforming our lifeworld and realms of experience in previously
unimaginable ways.
Coup détat
Silently, and carefully hidden from public scrutiny, a coup détat occurred
in 1913 in the United States of America.
The results of this bloodless coup are being
felt today on a truly global scale. With careful, detailed planning,
representatives of the most powerful financial institutions in both Europe
and the United States succeeded through the enactment of the Federal Reserve
Act (also known as the
Glass-Owen bill) in radically and permanently
altering the foundations of the nation as a whole.
Through the creation of
the Federal Reserve system, the financial interests
that conceived, wrote, and implemented the Glass-Owen bill took away the
authority of the United States government as theoretical representative of
the citizens of the country to print our own currency and placed that
authority in the hands of a private banking cartel.
According to Article 1,
Section 8 of the American Constitution, it is Congress to whom the power is
given to coin money and to regulate the value thereof.
The Federal Reserve Act of course interprets
this power quite literally as the coinage of pennies, nickels, dimes and
quarters; it is, however, the creation of money in the form of bank notes
that lies at the heart of the act. When the government requires money, the
United States treasury writes out IOUs in the form of U.S. treasury bonds,
which it then sells to the privately owned Federal Reserve system in
exchange for a Federal Reserve check.
In reality, the Federal Reserve bank simply
enters the corresponding numbers on its computer keyboard, once as a
liability, and once as an asset.
In other words, the numbers are created by the
Federal Reserve out of nothing, for which it then demands repayment with
interest. The funds are then credited to the governments account, from
which all the various bills are then paid. It is in that exact moment that
money as such is created by the Federal Reserve bank out of nothing. But
there is one additional trick used by all banks operating on the Federal
Reserve system: fractional reserve lending.
This scheme allows the bank to multiply the
amount of money it lends to clients tenfold without having the actual funds
in reserve to back it up. This entire scheme has allowed the hidden owners
of the private Federal Reserve system to effectively extort money from the
American people in the form of IOUs, also known as treasuries, which then
must be repaid with interest.
The legal anchoring of this scandalous system in the Glass-Owen bill in the
United States was only the beginning.
Like other central bank signatories to the
Bretton-Woods Agreement (and thereby to the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund), the US Federal Reserve system is able to control the amount
of money in circulation through several mechanisms, for example by raising
or lowering interest rates and/or the minimum reserve requirements of banks
in the fractional reserve lending system.
Through the enactment of the Federal Reserve
system, the essence of money has become debt. Through the creation of debt,
money comes into existence in the system. It thus becomes obvious that it is
never in the banks interest that clients, borrowers, actually pay off their
debts because that would leave the banks without interest payments.
When the borrowers happen to be sovereign
nations, for example from the developing world, or now the United States and
a number of countries in Western Europe, the interest payments earned by the
banks easily go into the hundreds of billions.
This is extraordinarily
profitable for banks who have been able to sit in on the negotiation of peace accords (through which terms of surrender and repayment of damages are
settled) and international trade agreement deliberations to regulate global
commerce and finance.
World War I and its outcome provide a very enlightening example of just how
this has been accomplished.
The terms forced on Germany through Article 231
of the
Treaty of Versailles laid the foundations for the consolidation of
the enormously powerful financial interests in London, New York, Frankfurt,
and Paris, which had been instrumental in pushing through, by hook and by
crook, the Federal Reserve Act in the United States.
(It should be noted
that these are the same financial interests which also did their part to
push the nations into
military conflict in the first place. The focus here however remains restricted to the
genesis and perpetration of the private central banking cartel as such and
its connections to the current financial crisis and the war on terrorism.)
The horror of World War I quickly led to the realization that the global
community of nations should not allow a recurrence of such cruelty, and that
universally recognized and accepted principles of conduct were needed to
guarantee international peace and harmony.
Such principles of good will, intentionally
redolent of the terms set out by the Peace of Westphalia, could only be
implemented through a common general will or global consent. In other words,
a League of Nations, a
Völkerbund in the strictest Kantian sense, was needed
to define and implement internationally valid principles of humanitarian,
indeed cosmopolitan conduct to benefit the entire human species and our
lifeworld.
It was this positive impulse among other things that led the participants in
the war to end all wars to found the Covenant of the League of Nations.
The agreement encompassed 26 principles to which
the 58 member states committed themselves. But the most central problem
confounding the ideals of the League was the fact that the agreement was
predicated on significant economic interests that essentially doomed the
treaty to failure from the start.
The League was based on the status quo as
defined by the victors of World War I, who, as simultaneous representatives
of ostensibly national interests did everything in their power to ensure
the richest gains possible for the elite bankers working behind the scenes
in New York, London, Paris, and Frankfurt. And the means to this end were
found in the terms of reparation payments they then forced on Germany.
An article featured in the May 31, 1922 issue of
the New York Times outlined the most salient demands being made on Germany
by the Allied entente powers:
The Reparation Commission called on Germany
to consent to the following undertakings before May 31:
-
Reduce expenditures and balance the
budget.
-
Halt the increase of the foreign
debt and the growth of paper money in circulation.
-
Accept a light supervision of her
efforts in that direction.
-
Take measures to prevent the further
flight of capital and to get back $2,000,000,000 spirited out of
the country in the last two years.
-
Assure the Reichbanks autonomy from
politics.
-
Resume publication of Government
fiscal statistics. [4]
Attentive readers will immediately note the
unmistakable parallels to the demands (austerity measures) frequently
imposed on developing nations through the international monetary fund in its
policy proposals formerly known as structural adjustment programs,
including demands for the privatization of the banking system, or to use the
phrase introduced by Fed speak, to guarantee the banks independence
(autonomy) from politics.
(In corrected translation, this is the simple
demand that this private banking cartel as the sole source of phony money
should be allowed to perpetrate its debt-based currency scam without any
supervision or control by the people or their representatives.)
A gamut of conditions imposed by the IMF has
consistently led to widespread domestic hardship and economic crises within
the nations in question, because the interests and well-being of the general
population are often clearly at odds with the IMF programs being
implemented.
Joseph Stiglitz put it this way:
The IMF is pursuing not just the objectives
set out in its original mandate, of enhancing global stability and
insuring that there are funds for countries facing a threat of recession
to pursue expansionary policies.
It is also pursuing the interests of
the financial community. This means the IMF has objectives that are
often in conflict with each other.
The tension is all the greater because this conflict cant be brought
out into the open: if the new role of the IMF were publicly
acknowledged, support for that institution might weaken, and those who
have succeeded in changing the mandate almost surely knew this.
Thus the
new mandate had to be clothed in ways that seemed at least superficially
consistent with the old. [5]
And it is precisely this extraordinary expansion
of the power of the private bank cartels that was central to much of the
behind-the-scenes maneuvering during and after World War I.
In a very enlightening essay published in
Foreign Affairs in 1936, Leon Fraser brought the true hidden agenda
of the banking elite into selective public view:
The truth was that the experts [i.e., of
the second Young Commission - jp] seized the occasion of the new
reparation adjustment as an excuse to repair a long recognized gap in
the international financial fabric.
The organization which they proposed had
functions not connected with reparations, and these ostensibly secondary
functions were, in the inner consciousness of the originators, the
predominating motives for its establishment. By some of the members - in
particular those connected with commercial banking - the institution was
envisaged as an instrument for opening up new fields of world trade by
means of fresh extensions of credit [
]
While there was no unanimity about the
opportuneness of creating more credit, all experts agreed that the Bank
could fill one obvious hiatus in the financial organization of the
world, namely provide a center for central bank collaboration and for
corporation to improve the international monetary mechanism. [6]
The bank Fraser was referring to, of course, is
none other than the central bank of all central banks, the
Bank for
International Settlements, with headquarters in Basel.
Louis McFadden, former banker-turned-congressman from Pennsylvania,
condemned the hidden motives and operational methods of the Versailles
Treaty in no uncertain terms. McFadden took particular aim at the Bank for
International Settlements, which took charge of the gold Germany was
required to deliver in reparations payments.
Writing with reference to Grotiuss theory of
just settlements of military conflicts (De Jure Belli ac Pacis), McFadden
argued that the Versailles Treaty had in fact been negotiated in bad faith,
with the House of Morgan and the usual suspects from the clique of
international bankers being the prime beneficiaries of the reparations
bonds, and that substantial aspects of the treaty had been worked out in the
financial centers of London well in advance of the actual negotiations in
Paris.
McFadden prophetically augured the long-term
consequences of the treaty as laying the,
foundation for the renewal of a
dozen wars that are legally justifiable. [7]
The consolidation of economic and financial power in the West at the end of
World War II made possible the ensuing rapid and encompassing globalization
of inchoate trends already visible in the League of Nations platform.
The establishment of
the United Nations in 1945
as well as the foundation of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund as stipulated by the outcome of the Bretton-Woods Agreement (1944),
contributed substantially to the international system of currency and
finance of a distinctively Anglo-American character.
This meant in particular that the central banks
of all member nations were largely to adopt the modus operandi of the
Federal Reserve system. The printing of national currencies, once the
privilege of sovereign governments, was to be replaced by the system of
government bonds or IOU issuance, which would then be lent or sold to the
private banking cartel (spearheaded by the countrys respective
central-bank) in exchange for currency notes - with interest due.
The outcomes of two world wars, in which a
private banking cartel had ultimately written the terms of economic and
financial surrender, had forced the vanquished into participant roles in the
greatest scam in human history:
the creation of money out of thin air
through debt, with interest payments in permanent flow to the elite
sphere of private bankers - all on a global scale.
Many of the newest investment vehicles and
resources discussed in growing numbers of studies have so successfully
interlocked the political realm with the corporate/financial that a clear
separation is no longer possible.
Nevertheless, among wide segments of the
populations in many countries, voting citizens are still convinced of the
sanctity of the elected office.
Such convictions are based on false advertising,
and the voters have failed to see the fusion between capital and the
successful campaign/office tenure regularly performed behind the smoke and
mirrors screens of the mass media. In a number of important instances, even
opposition/protest movements have been bought and staged. [8]
Yes we can! Si, se puede! should now be seen as
the pitiful chants of all those who fell for the change they believed in.
Change came in the form of continued bailouts for Wall Street banks, with
the former head of the New York Federal Reserve placed comfortably by
Obama
himself on the throne of the US treasury, immune from critique and
reprimand, despite his urgent e-mails to the legal counsel of AIG urging
silence in response to congressional queries on the extent of the Feds
bailout funds funneled into the pockets of Goldman Sachs.
(Of course at the time these revelations became
public - on the Internet! - the
mainstream media was busy convincing the
semi-conscious public of the importance of the then-and-now whereabouts of
Tiger Woodss genitalia.)
Its been all business as usual. But the
teary-eyed and desperate seem to fall for the Hollywood hype every time:
Hes the ONE!
The schematic procedures carried out by the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO
often acquire an outright absurd character. Such was the case in the
often-cited structural adjustment program developed for Bolivia in the
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) Policy Framework Paper for
1998 - 2001.
In exchange for much-needed IMF loans, Bolivia was required to
transfer the rights of the Cochabamba water system to the private firm of Aquas de Tunari, a subsidiary of the International Water Ltd./Bechtel
Corporation consortium.
(Bechtel gained international notoriety under
the George W. Bush administration as the recipient of generous no-bid
military reconstruction contracts in Iraq.)
The
privatization of the water supply meant that
prices for this necessity of life increased by more than 300%, becoming
unattainable for many families. With public outrage and potential violence
on the horizon, a report authored by World Bank experts advised: no public
subsidies should be given to ameliorate the increase in water tariffs in
Cochabamba. [9]
Recent machinations by the World Trade Organization have also led to
precarious globalization strategies. According to Greg Palast, an internal
report sent to his office at The Guardian revealed actual threats directed
at the leftist government of Brazil if the country continued to refuse to
sign the Financial Services Agreement of 1999.
This agreement formed the international legal
basis for the deregulation of so-called financial products, specifically
derivatives such as credit default swaps and mortgage backed securities,
which then led to the global financial meltdown.
The pattern of crisis followed by a ready-made plan for a global solution
has been persistent since the early 1800s, when European banking elites
pulled out all the stops in order to establish a central bank on American
soil. These were the same structural interests which eventually led to the
passage of the Glass-Owen bill. And it is within this pattern that the
origins of the current financial crisis are also to be found, specifically
within the highest echelons of the Federal Reserve system.
Subsequent to the
September 11 2001 attacks on New York and Washington,
D.C., the
Federal Reserve was forced to lower interest rates to a minimum
in order to avoid a potential collapse of a number of important services and
industries. This move enabled the decision by all branch banks nationwide to
make credit easily available, particularly for home mortgages.
Two years later, the entire country was in a
house-buying frenzy with visions of homes increasing in value year after
year until the end of time. Many buyers bought two or three in the hope of
flipping them into untold thousands in profit.
The foundations were laid for the initialization of a previously unknown
financial instrument -
BISTRO (Broad Index Secured Trust Offering) -
developed in the think tanks of J.P. Morgan.
At the speed of electronic funds transfers,
BISTRO enabled unimaginable exponential profits through credit default
swaps which the House of Morgan then divided up into packages and sold by
the thousands to interested parties among corporations, banks, insurance
giants, and investment funds worldwide.
As the German magazine Der Spiegel so accurately
put it,
bank managers and central bankers were the
captains of this ship, among them superstars such as J P Morgan manager
Blythe Masters and former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.
[10]
Attentive observers of financial history should
recognize the concrete developmental pattern at work here.
A putatively well-founded expansion of credit
and a corresponding economic boom are followed by a sudden retraction of
credit and an implosion of the markets. At the core of our current crisis is
the banking industry and its ability to create money and derivatives out of
thin air. The collapse was predictable, and in all likelihood carefully
planned.
No sooner had
the collapse of 2008 begun than
the directors of Americas leading banks began to issue ultimatums to the
American people through their own representative, Henry Paulson (former CEO
of Goldman Sachs), as the Secretary of the Treasury. If bank coffers were
not replenished with ample public funds, Americans would soon wake up to
martial law on the streets of many major cities.
And promptly, the see-no-evil representatives in Washington came to the
rescue of the global financial elite, all at the expense of tax payers, and
ultimately also at the expense of national sovereignty. Concomitant demands
for global solutions to this admittedly global problem were promptly put
on the national and international agenda by the G20 and by leading
economists such as Kenneth Rogoff.
The U.S. Congress recently ratified a
comprehensive overhaul of the nations financial system, and thereby granted
increased authority to the Federal Reserve. On a global scale, financial and
economic experts from around the world are in the process of developing
fundamental revisions to the Basel Accord (Basel III) within the framework
of the Bank for International Settlements. [11]
At the same time, the Federal Reserves late-2010 announcement that it would
initiate a second round of quantitative easing in its efforts to free up
credit and relieve financial institutions of moribund assets led to more
vociferous calls for a new global reserve currency to replace the ailing
dollar.
The Federal Reserves decision to increase
liquidity by printing more dollars is already seen as a potentially fatal
mistake by many skeptics particularly in China, which holds an inordinately
large sum of US dollars in its reserve currency trove. Russia and China,
among others, have already agreed to a bilateral exchange of goods and
services by using their own currencies, without the US dollar as
intermediary.
Unavoidable inflationary pressures guarantee that the days of the US dollar
as the worlds reserve currency are numbered; this outcome does not bode
well for the people of the United States, who very likely will see martial
law if and when prices for daily necessities such as gasoline skyrocket
beyond what is affordable.
As the chief operative for all the clandestine
forces intent on seeing a one-world government in control of the planet, the
Federal Reserve has been actively destroying the US currency as an
instrument of national sovereignty.
And in close collaboration with the Fed,
working groups within both the United Nations and the IMF have published key
position papers in which a new global currency is proposed, to be printed or
coined expectedly by a global central bank. [12]
The global war on
terror
Accompanying the increased authority of global instruments such as the IMF,
the WTO and the Bank for International Settlements, an international
surveillance network is fully in the making with far-reaching consequences
for individual life and liberty.
At particular risk today is the integrity of the
Internet as the last bastion of uncensored information exchange. With every
publicized cyber attack, whether a reality or an ad hoc creation, new
demands go out for increased security measures and legislation to control
both form and content online.
New key supranational concepts such as
Al
Qaeda, terrorist networks or suspicious money transfers are now in
common use in public discourse and enable the implementation of
unprecedented military/political control measures and surveillance
strategies over ordinary citizens.
The readiness of governments worldwide to adopt
anti-terror measures that are potentially inimical to all forms of
individual freedom is predicated on the questionable acceptance of the
official explanation offered by the US government and its intelligence
services for the events that transpired on 9/11.
The paucity of critique, particularly among
mainstream US media, of the implausible official narrative of all that
transpired on 9/11 is itself sufficient evidence of a thoroughly top=down
controlled American press.
The analyses of David Ray Griffin and Steven Jones (among many others)
[13] of multiple inconsistencies and sheer impossibilities in the official
explanation of the 9/11 attacks provide clear evidence that there were and
are far more sinister plots at work than what the American public is ready
to believe.
Answers to the inevitable cui bono? question
point to the long-term beneficiaries of global control which will ultimately
allow for no exceptions.
The pattern is always the same. Present a crisis of epoch proportions, and
offer solutions on a global scale which ultimately consolidate the interests
of a
New World Order, one as envisioned by Auguste Comte, with bankers and a
select intellectual elite in complete control.
The Federal Reserve system should be seen for
what it is - the agency of an international clique of banking elites who are
hell-bent on obtaining a global government, with a single system of
universal justice, a single currency, and an all-encompassing surveillance
network as guarantors of a fail-proof, totalitarian, neo-feudalistic regime.
Thanks to the efforts of this same
global elite, the United States is in its
last throes and will eventually succumb to the constraints its leaders have
willingly adopted within the context of globalization.
As admirable as perpetual peace might be under a system of benevolent
reason, with the sanctity of all terrestrial life on earth foremost in mind,
the concrete historical track record of those most actively engaged in
bringing the ideals of this New World Order into full fruition suffices
completely as a reason to reject their goals.
Elite bankers in the United States and Europe conceived and enacted the
Federal Reserve system as a major stepping stone toward eventual global
governance of a neo-feudalistic society.
The continuing global economic crisis was also
conceived and implemented as a further essential tool in bringing about a
one-world government controlled by bankers and their intellectual shills
sitting in crucial positions and calling the shots - qui custodiet custodes?
The Feds covert policies and clandestine machinations are accelerating
the need and demand for a global currency to replace existing national
currencies.
In previous eras, the implementation of such
plans and intentions would have been deemed high treason and appropriately
punished; in todays parlance, it should most properly be categorized as an
act of terrorism.
