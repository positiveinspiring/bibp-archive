Multiple U.S. intelligence sources have reported
to
WMR that a super-classified network with
only some 70 terminals in select U.S. government locations handled the
parallel command-and-control activities that permitted the 9/11 terrorist
attacks to be successful.
The above top secret network bears the acronym PDAS.
WMR has not yet discovered what the acronym
stands for, however, the system is limited to only a few hundred people with
Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI)
Special Access Program (SAP)
need-to-know access, in addition to the president and vice president.
On September 11, 2001, PDAS was used to convey the information from the Air
Force Chief of Staff to the White House, CIA, and other select agencies that
the Air Force had successfully intercepted and downed a target over
Pennsylvania. It is believed that the target in question was United flight
93, although there is no confirmation that the aircraft was in fact the one
downed by Air Force interceptors.
The Air Force Chief of Staff on 9/11 was General
John Jumper, who had become the top Air
Force commander on September 6, 2001, just five days before the 9/11
attacks.
There is also reason to believe that the PDAS terminal at the
Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC)
at the White House was used to coordinate the activities related to the
aerial attack on the Pentagon.
Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta
claimed Vice President Dick Cheney was present at the PEOC at 9:25 am
on the morning of 9/11, before the alleged impact of American Airlines
flight 77 on the building.
Mineta testified before the 9/11 Commission that Cheney was aware
of special orders concerning a plane heading toward Washington.
Mineta said:
During the time that the airplane was
coming into the Pentagon, there was a young man who would come in and
say to the vice president... the plane is 50 miles out... the plane is
30 miles out... and when it got down to the plane is 10 miles out, the
young man also said to the vice president do the orders still stand?
And the vice president turned and whipped
his neck around and said, Of course the orders still stand, have you
heard anything to the contrary?
PDAS terminals are reportedly located at:
-
the White House
-
on board Air Force One
-
the Pentagon
-
CIA headquarters
-
the National Security Agency
-
the Boeing E-4 Advanced Airborne Command
Post that was seen flying over Washington, DC, on 9/11 after the
attacks
-
the Defense Intelligence Agency at
Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, DC
-
the Raven Rock Mountain Complex in
Pennsylvania where Cheney hid out after the 9/11 attacks
Mineta later followed up with reporters and
stated,
When I overheard something about the
orders still stand and so, what I thought of was that they had already
made the decision to shoot something down.
It now appears that PDAS was used by Cheney
to implement on the morning of 9/11 a new policy issued on June 1, 2001 that
provided for a stand down protocol that replaced a long-standing
shoot-down order for hijacked and suspected hijacked planes.
The new order transferred the authority to shoot
down aircraft from the Pentagon and NORAD military commanders to the
president, vice president, or secretary of defense.
