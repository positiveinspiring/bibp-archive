Corporate socialism was off and running shortly after the
turn of the 1900s. Don't believe that?
Well, listen carefully to the
late researcher, British historian, and Professor Antony C.
Sutton saying in an interview that the U.S. Army and Wall Streeters apparently aided and abetted the Bolshevik
Revolution!
This 8 minute YouTube "Professor Antony Sutton
-
Wall Street & the Bolshevik
Revolution," ought to get readers' attention, Part 1.
In another Professor Sutton interview, he talks about the
'infamous'
Order of Skull & Bones at Yale and what Sutton
found out in what he calls the "Yalegate Papers," which
apparently tell about getting and maintaining power in 'Introduction to Skull & Bones.'
In Part 2,
Sutton discusses the Hegelian Dialectic (problem, reaction,
solution) and the U.S. individuals - and families-of-power
to bring about a
One World Order.
He discusses a Hegelian
system
of education and the drive for power and remolding the
United States of America.
In Part 3, the Professor discusses an interesting
repartee about semantics used by Vice-President
Bush
regarding Bush's membership in the secret society 'order.'
According to Professor Sutton,
the accomplishments of the Skull & Bones 'order' were the
creation of one war (WWI) and two revolutions - readers will
be surprised to find out which ones they were.
Sutton discusses what was
accomplished, e.g., conflict management and steering
history.
In Part 4, according to Professor Sutton, 'the order' has
been at war with the United States since 1833!
They can't live with the U.S.
Constitution and they want to change it. Anything sound
familiar today? Too many people are willing to regard those
people who gain power and then 'worship' them as god,
according to Sutton.
He talks about how they are
using the Hegelian Dialectic to establish control, war, and
by managing the conflict, can control the next decade or so.
He talks about,
That 'the order' is willing to
back some Marxist states but not others.
In another interview, Professor Sutton talks about
the
Trilateral Commission founded by
David Rockefeller and
other foundations in 1973 to encourage discussions among
three regions and the commission's influences on U.S.
government.
There is an interlock between
the news media and the Trilateral Commission.
And finally, Professor Sutton talks
about psychotronic
(Radio Frequency) weapons and behavior modification that
work like drugs, if you use the correct RF wave.
Have readers heard about
the "Woodpecker"?... not the birds in your backyard trees! Sutton
defines psychotronics, which readers won't want to miss
hearing.
What health effects are involved?

When the media or the government talk about "conspiracy
theories" or places conspiracy theorist labels on those
telling what they have researched, one has to question
whether it's a classic example of the "pot calling the
kettle black."
