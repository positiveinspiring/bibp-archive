Proposed
Constitution for
the Newstates of America
The
Proposed Constitution Articles of the New States of America
This New States Constitution
denies most of the freedoms that you now enjoy
This Awareness
wishes to inform entities that this New States Constitution denies most of
the freedoms that you now enjoy, and while it is worded in legal terminology
to give it the appearance of creating something that will diminish crime and
so forth, it is also creating a police state such as the reserving of all
powers now given in the New States Constitution to the police.
This Awareness indicates that this kind of phraseology
as that which means everything except what is covered in this Constitution,
the police then can make up any rules they want for any situation that is
not covered in this document. That there are so many similar and tricky phrases
in the New States Constitution that there will be little room for anyone to
move or have any rights of freedom, including freedom of speech, assembly,
etc.; that it will make it almost impossible to ever escape from the domination
of these laws, or to ever again gain freedoms that have been allowed under
the Constitution.
Some Scary Parts of the
New States Constitution
This Awareness indicates that entities really
need to read the New States Constitution. It gives the president a 9 year
term in office, and senators also have a long term. It creates a way of dealing
with certain people whereby they are placed in insane asylum situations if
they are not cooperative and there is not a trial or remedy to give them the
change to defend themselves. It would allow entities who are political antagonists
to be removed from society and treated by psychiatric drugs or experimentation
or given lobotomies or whatever else is prescribed for their social redemption.
It is a very frightening document if entities
read between the lines as to what is being said in the document, for there
are ways of saying things that do not sound so bad until you stop to think
about what was left out or what can be implied from a general term. For example,
it would allow private property to be taken without due process. It would
allow private property to be taken without reasonable payment. There are so
many areas in this that by leaving the word out, allows for all kinds of violations.
Where it appears in the reading that it is saying
one thing favorable, such as a statement that property cannot be taken without
compensation, sounds like: "Well that's fair!", until you stop to
think, the word left out that was in the old Constitution was just
compensation. They could give you ten cents for it and take your property
under this constitution, but if it were "just" compensation,
they would have to pay you fair market price or something close to fair market
price. Thus, by leaving out a term here or there, this constitution appears
to say one thing on the surface, while in actually creates a means by which
you have no rights and can have those rights taken from you for little
cost or little provocation.

A CONSTITUTION FOR THE NEWSTATES OF AMERICA, from the book, THE EMERGING CONSTITUTION by Rexford G. Tugwell, published 1974 (Harper & Row: $20.00) illustrates with chilling clarity the final objective of regional governance conspirators. The goal is a corporate state concentrating economic, political and social powers in the hands of a ruling elite. "A Constitution for the Newstates of America", is the fortieth version of this revolutionary document prepared by a team of social experimenters at the CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, Fund for the Republic (Ford Foundation), Post Office Box 4068, Santa Barbara, California 93103.
The Center, its first objective accomplished, has appointed socialist-oriented University of Denver Chancellor Maurice B. Mitchell as its new head and may merge with the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a Colorado-based world government policy promotion agency.
Aspen Institute Chairman is Robert O. Anderson, chief executive officer, Atlantic Richfield Company; member, Committee for Economic Development (laid ground work for regional government), and advisory board member, Institute for International Education. Anderson is the principal figure in campaign aimed at seizing control of the National Rifle Association.

A CONSTITUTION FOR THE
NEWSTATES OF AMERICA
Review
by Dr. Peter David Beter, political economist, author and lecturer (deceased)
In 1964, the writing of a new constitution for America began, at a tax-exempt foundation with the misleading name, Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions.
The people who took it upon themselves to write this new constitution on our behalf were, of course, not elected representatives, or in any other way our representatives. As a tax-exempt foundation, they were able to do political work on what amounts to a subsidy taken from your taxes, but you and I were never asked if we wanted a new constitution written. Indeed, only a very tiny fraction of the people in the United States even know that it exists: it has been made known to practically no one except a select category of influential people whose views and interest generally coincide with those of the people who wrote it. The American people as a whole are still in the dark about it, and this situation is deliberate. It is therefore truly a "secret" constitution.
This model constitution took ten years to write, drawing upon the efforts of more than 100 people. A preliminary version was published in 1970 and given exposure in limited circles. But, in 1974, an essentially final version was quietly published in a book entitled THE EMERGING CONSTITUTION by Rexford G. Tugwell (Harper & Row, $20), the man who directed the formulation of the new constitution. It is the fortieth draft. During most of the time that their constitution was being written, the Center for Study of Democratic Institutions was lavishly funded to the tune of $2,500,000 annually.
DR. BETER'S CRITICAL ANALYSIS
Certain powerful forces hoped to celebrate our nation's Bicentennial in 1976 by replacing the freedoms guaranteed in our present Constitution with their own dictatorship - a cleverly disguised dictatorship. It has been made to superficially resemble the government that we have now, so that we will not recognize it for what it is - until too late. They are using every propaganda trick at their command to make us lower our guard. And they are about to put us all in a condition of economic desperation to persuade us to accept their cleverly disguised dictatorship.
Our U.S. Constitution, according to the Preamble, is intended to provide for justice, domestic tranquility, common defense and general welfare, and to secure the blessings of liberty not only to ourselves, but to our posterity These were the goals that shaped our Constitution. And this is the Constitution that enabled America to become a great nation of free people.
TWENTY-FIVE YEAR CONSTITUTION
The Newstates of America Constitution has a Preamble, too - it mentions not one of the objectives of our present Constitution. Instead of "justice and domestic tranquility", the new constitution seeks only "good order" without defining what that means. The very first words are "So that we may join in common endeavors" - and the body of the new constitution makes it clear that this means an end to individual endeavors. Their new constitution is expressly states to be good only for a prescribed period of 25 years: our posterity is left to fend for itself. No reference is made in the Preamble to our defense or general welfare. Worst of all: the matter of liberty - so central to our present Constitution - is totally ignored in the Preamble of the new one, which seeks only, "an adequate and self-repairing government". The emphasis throughout their new constitution is on the government - not on the people. "Adequate" turns out to mean: too powerful to be challenged. And "self-repairing" means that the laws and governmental structures can be continually changed and shifted to permit anything our rulers wish to do.
Before I explore some of the details of their secret new constitution, let me give you a bird's-eye view: Article I is divided into two parts defining "Rights" and "Responsibilities." It turns out that some of our present rights disappear outright, and practically all of the rest become conditional and fragile, able to be terminated on the whim of the government. The responsibilities, however, which are obligations of the citizen to the government, are absolute and unconditional.
TEN FEDERAL REGION NEWSTATES
Article II defines what are called the "Newstates". The 50 states we have now become 10 in number. It is no accident that our federal government for the past several years has managed its outlying activities through ten federal regions. These 10 new states will be completely subservient to the federal government and creatures of it. Read The New States Review
