The Catastrophe of #MH17
#BBC in the Search of the "#BUK"
The Video Report Deleted by @BBC
The original BBC Video Report was published by
BBC Russian Service on July 23, 2014.
In a bitter irony, the BBC is censoring its own news productions.
-
Why did BBC delete this report by
Olga Ivshina?
-
Is it because the BBC team was unable to
find any evidence that a rocket was launched in the area that the
Ukrainian Security Service ("SBU") alleges to be the place from
which the Novorossiya Militia launched a "BUK" missile?
-
Or is it because every eyewitness
interviewed by the BBC team specifically indicated the presence of a
Ukrainian military aircraft right beside the Malaysian Airlines
Boeing MH17 at the time that it was shot down?
-
Or is it because of eyewitness accounts
confirming that the Ukrainian air force regularly used civilian
aircraft flying over Novorossiya as human shields to protect its
military aircraft conducting strikes against the civilian population
from the Militias anti-aircraft units?
Highlights of Witness statements (see complete
transcript below):
-
Eyewitness #1: There were two explosions
in the air. And this is how it broke apart. And [the fragments] blew
apart like this, to the sides. And when
-
Eyewitness #2:
And there was another
aircraft, a military one, beside it. Everybody saw it.
-
Eyewitness #1: Yes, yes. It was flying
under it, because it could be seen. It was proceeding underneath,
below the civilian one.
-
Eyewitness #3: There were sounds of an
explosion. But they were in the sky. They came from the sky. Then
this plane made a sharp turn-around like this. It changed its
trajectory and headed in that direction [indicating the direction
with her hands].

Intro of BBC Report (For Full
Transcript see below)
The "black boxes" of the crashed Malaysian Boeing have finally been
transferred into the hands of the experts. However, how much can they tell
us?
The recorders logged the coordinates and the heading of the aircraft at the
time of the incident and may have recorded the sound of the explosion.
However, they will not tell us what exactly caused the explosion.
The inhabitants of the nearby villages are certain that they saw military
aircraft in the sky shortly prior to the catastrophe. According to them, it
actually was the jet fighters that brought down the Boeing.
The Ukrainian government rejects this version of events. They believe that
the Boeing was shot down using a missile from a "BUK" complex that came in
from Russia.
The Ukrainian Security Service has published photographs and a video, which,
in its opinion, prove that the Boeing was shot down with a "BUK" missile.
BBC reporter Olga Ivshina and producer Oksana Vozhdayeva
decided to find the place from which the missile was allegedly launched.

DPR Representative:
Here it is.
Olga Ivshina, BBC:
The black boxes from the crashed Boeing are
finally being transferred into the hands of the experts. However, how
much can they tell us?
The recorders logged the coordinates and the heading of the aircraft at
the time of the incident and may have recorded the sound of the
explosion. However, they will not tell us what exactly caused the
explosion.
The inhabitants of the nearby villages are certain that they saw
military aircraft in the sky shortly prior to the catastrophe. According
to them, it actually was the jet fighters that brought down the Boeing.
Eyewitness #1:
There were two explosions in the air. And
this is how it broke apart. And [the fragments] blew apart like this, to
the sides. And when
Eyewitness #2:
And there was another aircraft, a military
one, beside it. Everybody saw it.
Eyewitness #1:
Yes, yes. It was flying under it, because it
could be seen. It was proceeding underneath, below the civilian one.
Eyewitness #3:
There were sounds of an explosion. But they
were in the sky. They came from the sky. Then this plane made a sharp
turn-around like this. It changed its trajectory and headed in that
direction [indicating the direction with her hands].
Olga Ivshina, BBC:
The Ukrainian government rejects this
version of events. They believe that the Boeing was shot down using a
missile from
a "BUK" complex that came in from the direction of Russia.
Vitaliy Naida, Department of Counterintelligence of SBU
[Ukrainian Security Service]:
This was a BUK M1 system from which the
aircraft was shot down. It came to Ukraine early in the morning on the
17th of July. It was delivered by a tow truck to the city of Donetsk.
After that, it was redeployed from Donetsk,
as part of a column of military equipment, to the area of the
city of Torez, to the area of Snezhnoye, to the area of Pervomaisk.
Olga Ivshina, BBC:
The Ukrainian Security Service has published
photographs and a video, which, in its opinion, prove that the Boeing
was shot down with a "BUK" missile. We attempted to verify these
photographs and information at the location.
One of the photographs showed a landscape not far from the city of Torez,
on which smoke could be seen coming from the presumed location of the
missiles launch. We attempted to find this location, and it appears
that we were successful.
We are now on the outskirts of the city of Torez. Behind me,
approximately five kilometers away, is the
city of Snezhnoye. And the
landscape here matches the landscape that we can see on the photograph
published by the Ukrainian Security Service.
To find the place from which the smoke was allegedly coming from, we
adopted as markers these three poplars and the group of trees.
Presumably, this is the place that can be
seen on the photograph published by
the SBU. And here are our markers:
the three solitary poplars and the small group of trees in the distance.
The smoke that can be seen on the photograph came from somewhere over
there [pointing behind her], behind my back. The SBU believes that this
is a trace coming from the launch of a "BUK" missile.
However, it must be noted that there are here, approximately in the same
place, the Saur-Mogila memorial, near which the fighting continues
almost unabated, and a coalmine. It turns out that the smoke with the
same degree of probability could have been coming from any of these
locations.
Having circled around the nearby fields, we were unable to find any
traces of a missile launch. Nor did the local inhabitants that we
encountered see any "BUK" either.
At the ruins of an apartment building in the city of Snezhnoye, the
topic of the jet fighters that may have been escorting civilian aircraft
comes up again. A bomb dropped from above took away the lives of eleven
civilians here.
Sergey Godovanets, Commander of the Militia of the city of
Snezhnoye:
They use these civilian aircraft to hide
behind them. It is only now that they stopped flying over us - but,
usually, civilian aircraft would always fly above us. And they hide
[behind them].
[The experience in] Slavyansk had
demonstrated that they would fly out from behind a civilian aircraft,
bomb away, and then hide, once again, behind the civilian aircraft and
fly away.
Olga Ivshina, BBC:
The commander of the local militia
emphasizes that they have no weaponry capable of shooting down a jet
fighter [flying] at a significant height. However, he says that if such
weaponry were to appear, they would have tried to.
Sergey Godovanets:
If we know that it is not a civilian
aircraft, but a military one, then - yes.
Olga Ivshina, BBC:
So, could the Boeing have been shot down by
the militias that had mistaken it for a military aircraft? There is as
yet no unequivocal confirmation of either this or any other version [of
what took place].
The international experts are just beginning
their work with the information obtained from the crashed airliner. It
now appears that it is difficult to overstate the importance of this
investigation.
Olga Ivshina, BBC.

Slavyangrad Website
An excellent overview of some of the key damning
evidentiary red flags inexorably pointing to the real culprits behind the
collapse of Ukraine as a country, the genocidal fratricidal civil war, and,
most recently, the devastating catastrophe of Malaysian Airlines Boeing MH17
that took away almost 300 lives.
These culprits are the gang of murderers we have
termed the Ukrainian Junta and their overseas patrons and masters, the
leadership of the worlds expiring superpower -
the USA.
