For Standard & Poors to downgrade US debt from the highest level of AAA like
the Japanese emperor admitting that World War 2 is not going exactly
according to plan. It is a public admission of defeat.
The
aware
humans of the planet have long known the US is bankrupt, but now the
spokespersons for the ruling cabal are admitting this in public. This is one
of those geopolitical turning points that historians will be discussing for
generations to come.
The full consequences of this change will continue to
unfold for months and years to come until a new age in the history of the
planet begins.
There is no going back now.
Let us examine what is about to end and why nobody will miss it.
A cabal of
gangsters has used murder and bribery and war to force its will on the
humans of the planet for at least 300 years. They were planning to
murder 5
billion or so human beings in order to maintain their rule in the face of
an
awakening slave populace.
Instead, they are being told to step aside
peacefully before they and their entire extended families are killed.
They
are being offered a chance to keep their wealth and privileges in exchange
for freeing their subjects. The wise and powerful amongst them have already
agreed. The problem is now one of implementation.
This is one of those rare moments in history where the actions of a few
horsemen, and their mates, determines history for thousands of years. The
horsemen in question are dealing with bonds and financial instruments issued
by empires and governments and yet controlled by a few individuals.
One case in point is the two Japanese gentlemen illegally detained in Italy
in June of 2009,
carrying $134.5 billion worth of bonds. The debate over who
has the right to cash these bonds, and trillions of dollars worth of similar
bonds, is one the one side a technical debate about arcane financial
instruments, on a different level it is a debate about the future of the
planet earth.
The result of this debate will mean a change of the public story, or His
Story (and Her Story). The people in charge of the plot, the people who
wrote
the story of 911, the invasion of Iraq, the war on terrorism etc,
are being replaced.
This is one of those moments in mass psychology where the herd of sheep
decides to change direction; only in this case were [we] are dealing with
the herd of human sheep and the direction of the planet earth.
Western Civilization was responsible for a paradigm shift in history. It
created the industrial and scientific revolutions that enabled the birth of
a transportation, communications and knowledge revolution unprecedented in
the 5 billion year history of this planet.
Unfortunately this revolution
took place amidst a moral vacuum at the very top of the power structure.
It
is as if a three year old child had been given control over both a candy
story [store] and a shotgun. He was able to use the shotgun to get all the
candy he wanted but he had no idea what to do next. Whenever somebody tried
to tell him too much candy was bad for him, he shot the person who said
that.
In the same way, the so-called intellectual elite of the west was unable to
win any of the moral or scientific debates about the direction of the planet
and so they resorted to violence and bribery.
Over the next several weeks and months, we will witness the continuing
collapse of the criminal cabal that has ruled the planet. They have resorted
to violent temper tantrums such as
the nuclear tsunami in Japan and the
murder of the ruling party youth in Norway.
They may try more violence and
mayhem still before they are finally subdued.
On a more concrete level, an international consensus is emerging. The first
agreement is that the current power brokers will cling on until their system
fully collapses and they have no choice. This will be seen in newspaper
headlines in the form of stock market and currency crises in the US and the
Mediterranean. There will be meetings, announcements and interventions but
these will be impotent at the end of the day.
At a certain point, when the elite that currently rules the planet realizes
they are about to be hung from the nearest lamp-pole, they will cast aside
their arrogance and ask for help.
When that happens, the
White Dragon Society will be ready to step in.
It
will request a campaign to,
In exchange, it will promise
the
current ruling elite financial and physical security as well as a change to
participate in the coming bonanza.
This all sounds very abstract but in the coming weeks a series of high-level
meetings have been arranged, and have already begun. It will not be long
before what used to be dismissed as conspiracy theory will simply be seen as
yesterdays news.
Please be patient though. Major historical changes must be handled with
great care.
Please be optimistic but also realistic.
