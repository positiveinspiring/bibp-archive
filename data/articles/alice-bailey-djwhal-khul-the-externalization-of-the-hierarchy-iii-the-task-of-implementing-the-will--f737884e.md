The Task of Implementing the Will-to-GoodMay
1944
How is the Hierarchy working at this time? In what manner are the Masters aiding the
work of the Forces of Light? Can something of moment and of lasting significance happen at
this coming May Full Moon? How do the Masters look at the world situation? What are Their
plans? Can these plans be materialized? And what can the individual disciple, initiate and
world disciple accomplish in the face of humanity's dilemma?
These are all normal and intelligent questions and can be answered partially, though
not fully, owing to three reasons:
1. The outcome of the coming climaxing conflict depends on humanity itself. A greater
effort is required, particularly in America - an effort to see the issues clearly, to
understand the causes of this war, and a determination to take those steps - through
propaganda and discussion - which will clarify the minds of the masses. Into these
agelong causes I cannot here go; there is not time to do more than enumerate certain of
them
- Universal and ancient selfishness, materialism, aggression, and national prides. Of
these faults all nations have been guilty.
- A sense of separateness of which the border issue between such nations as Russia and
Poland is symbolic. The need of humanity and its general well-being comes [432] eternally
first. Nations and their ephemeral disputes are of secondary interest.
- A tendency - centuries old - among the Germanic peoples to dominate, to take what is not
their own, to regard themselves as unique, superior, and as embodying a super-race; there
is also a fixed determination, on behalf of their own interests, to plunge other nations
and races into war. Today they have achieved a planetary war.
2. There are factors present in this battle between evil and good which are so deeply
esoteric and hidden from the understanding of the most advanced human being that it is
useless for me to enlarge upon their existence. They are concerned with the ability of the
mind, or of the mind principle, to react to truth or to lies; the mystery of this reaction
is hidden in the evolutionary process itself. A point can be reached in human development
where acceptance of deception is impossible and clear thinking is normal. The potency of
glamor (which holds so many people in prison) is related to this mystery. Glamor holds
not those who are mentally and emotionally undeveloped; they are complete realists and see
life in its bare outlines and baldly. The highly developed are not subject to glamor;
they also think realistically but this time with true mental perception and not
instinctively. The thinking man, in his process of training, but who is still largely
governed by his emotions, is exceedingly prone to glamor, and very often to the glamor
of a sentimental so-called loving attitude. These people do not realize that love is a
process of determining action on the basis of the ultimate good of the individual or the
group, and that the immediate reactions of the personality are secondary. In this conflict
the Hierarchy is concerned with the final issue, with the future welfare and the ultimate
well-being of humanity. They are not so concerned with the immediate suffering and pain of
the personalities involved. Is this a hard saying? A tiny replica of this correct attitude
can be found in the influence, words and actions of those wise parents, those farsighted
guides [433] of youth, who see the need of discipline if their children are in the future
to be rightly oriented, and to live correctly. The temporary discomfort of the discipline
and the rebellion of the children do not in any way condition such parents. They see
ahead.
3. The conflict at present involving humanity has its source not only in human weakness
and selfishness, but in a situation which has existed for ages between the Great White
Lodge of Masters and the Lodge of Black Adepts. This started in Atlantean times and must
now be fought out to a finish. With the details of this struggle (fought on mental levels)
you have no concern, except in so far as you and the rest of mankind react to lies or to
truth. Two streams of mental energy or of thought-directed ideas impinge powerfully at
this time upon the human consciousness. One is embodied in the lying propaganda emanating
from the Axis Powers and affecting potently not only their own peoples but the selfish
politicians, the intolerant and the racially conditioned people, and the well-intentioned
but short-sighted appeasers and pacifists. The second stream is embodied in the idealism,
the humanitarianism, and the clear presentation of the factual situation which
characterize the best minds in every nation and which condition the thinking of the
leaders of the United Nations; this stream has, for instance, conditioned the attitude and
the changed orientation of the USSR, and has brought them to a position of cooperation and
to a relinquishing of some of their separative ideas.
