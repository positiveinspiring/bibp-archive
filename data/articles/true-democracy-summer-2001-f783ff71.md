CIA-front involved in intelligence projects, weapons development, and
underground bases development.
Additionally, a Major at the Department of Defense stated to me unequivocally
that a Rand study documented that Depleted Uranium is "harmless." This after
one of the Department of Defense's own people admitted that depleted uranium
is extremely harmful.
Western Europe is very angry at former President Bill Clinton for instigating
the war in Kosovo because depleted uranium was used there setting up the contraction
of leukemia in Italians, Dutch, Belgians, and Portuguese at least.
The French
press didn't indicate that any Frenchmen had contracted the disease but they
may have by now.
To develop weapons is unnecessary. The infrastructure, quality of life in
not only the United States but the rest of the world is sacrificed because
voluminous amounts of money are devoted to weapons. They don't solve problems;
they perpetuate them.
Underground bases are completely unnecessary. They are only developed for
the elite and the leaders. And for what purpose? To keep them alive while
the rest of us die.
