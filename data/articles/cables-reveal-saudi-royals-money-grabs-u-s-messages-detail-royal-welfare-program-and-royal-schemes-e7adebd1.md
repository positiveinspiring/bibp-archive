The handouts Saudi King Abdullah is
granting to his people are nothing compared
to the handouts his family's thousands of princes and princesses have
received over the past two decades.

American diplomatic cables recently
released by WikiLeaks detail the royal welfare program, which has
cost the country an estimated $2 billion per year and has angered many
Saudis.
The royal patronage system doled out, in the
mid-1990s, $800 per month even to,
"the lowliest member of the most remote
branch of the family," according to the documents.
Sons of modern Saudi Arabia's founder, on the
other hand, received up to $270,000 per month,
Reuters reports.
The monthly stipends begin at birth, with bonus payments available for
marriage or palace building. But they are apparently not enough for some
royals:
The cables also detail royal money-grabbing
schemes, from the complex (skimming from "off-budget spending" projects)
to the simple (borrowing money from the banks... and never repaying it).
Despite all this, the cable notes, there are few
"super-rich" Saudi princes, as they are,
"more adept at squandering than accumulating
wealth."
Resentment has already pushed King Abdullah to
institute some reforms - like no longer paying for the cell phones of
thousands of princes and princesses.
