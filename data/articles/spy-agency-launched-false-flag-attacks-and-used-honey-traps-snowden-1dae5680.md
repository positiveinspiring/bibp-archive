Spy Agencies Use Dirty Tricks
We've repeatedly noted that the spy agencies
aren't just like giant peeping Tom's, but they use their capabilities in
mischievous offensive actions.
We've
warned since 2009 (and see
this) that the government could be
launching cyber "false
flag attacks" in order to justify a crackdown on the Internet and
discredit web activists.
A
new
report from NBC News shows that the British spy agency
used "false flag attacks" and other dirty tricks:
British spies have developed "dirty
tricks" for use against nations, hackers, terror groups, suspected
criminals and arms dealers that include releasing computer viruses,
spying on journalists and diplomats, jamming phones and computers, and
using sex to lure
targets into "honey traps."
***
The agency's goal was to "destroy, deny,
degrade [and] disrupt" enemies by
"discrediting" them, planting misinformation and shutting down
their communications.
Sound familiar?
It should:
Between 1956 and 1971, the FBI operated a
program known as
COINTELPRO, for Counter Intelligence
Program.
Its purpose was to interfere with the
activities of the organizations and individuals who were its targets or,
in the words of long-time FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, to "expose,
disrupt, misdirect, discredit or otherwise neutralize" them.
NBC continues:
[The agency] also uses
"false flag" operations, in
which British agents carry out online
actions that are designed to look like they were performed by one of
Britain's adversaries.
***
JTRIG used negative information
to attack private companies, sour
business relationships and
ruin deals.
***
Changing photos on social media sites and
emailing and texting colleagues and neighbors unsavory information.
Here are two of the documents from the British
intelligence service
leaked by Edward Snowden:
Previous Snowden documents published by NBC also
evidence false flag attacks.
In another document taken from the NSA by
Snowden and obtained by NBC News, a JTRIG official said the units
mission included computer network
attacks, disruption, Active Covert Internet Operations, and
Covert Technical Operations.
Among the
methods listed in the document were jamming phones, computers and email
accounts and masquerading as an enemy in a false flag operation.
The same document said GCHQ was increasing
its emphasis on using cyber tools to attack adversaries.
Postscript: We await
further revelations of "false flag" attacks
by spy agencies.
