Independent presidential hopeful Ralph Nader
spoke outside the White House Friday, calling for the impeachment of
President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.
Nader said the President has,
dishonored the White House and brought a
pattern of waste.
A wasteful defense is a weak defense and a
weak defense, inspires waste, Nader said.
Surrounded by a handful of supporters, holding
signs which read From Katrina to Iraq, Colossal Failure, and Resign
Bush-Cheney, Like Nixon-Agnew, Nader charged that the President and Vice
President are currently
committing five impeachable offenses, on a
daily basis, including:
-
criminal use of offense against Iraq
-
condoned and approved systematic torture
-
arresting thousands of Americans
denying them habeas corpus and violating attorney/client privilege
-
signing 800 signing statements,
precluding the president from actually having to follow the laws he
signs
-
systematic spying on Americans without
judicial approval
Nader also had criticism for the 2008 Democratic
and Republican presidential candidates, calling Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., the corporate
candidates.
Nader, 73,
announced in February, 2008 that he is
running for president again.
If Democrats cant landslide the
Republicans this year, they ought to just wrap up, close down, emerge in
a different form, he said at the time, arguing that as president he
would take on the bloated military budget, reform labor laws, repeal
the Taft-Hartley Act, and target corporate crime.
Nader, has run for president as an independent
in the past three presidential elections in 1996, 2000, and 2004. Many
Democrats believe he was one of the reasons then-Vice President Al Gore
lost the 2000 election to Bush.
Running on the Green Party ticket, Nader won
more than 97,000 votes in Florida, where Gore ultimately lost to Bush by 537
votes.
