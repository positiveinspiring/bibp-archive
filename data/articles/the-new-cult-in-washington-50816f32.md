The futuristic building, characterized as a "spiritual UN" will be a "symbol of the brotherhood and sisterhood of mankind," according to the brochure issued from Temple headquarters, Greenwich, Conn. A wing of this modern-day Tower of Babel will be accorded to each of the six international faiths: Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity and Islam. AMONG OTHER endorsers listed are,
Jack Benny Douglas MacArthur II, ambassador to Japan Max Lerner of the New York Post Prof. J. B. Rhine of Duke University Roland Gammon of the Laymen's Movement and World Parliament of Religions Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes, president of Guatemala Sir Roy Welensky, prime minister, Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Rev. Fred Jordan, president, International Spiritualists, Norfolk, Va. Philip S. Linnik, director Universal Brotherhood Center, Glen Cove, Long Island, N. Y. James A. Linen, president Time-Life Inc. S. A.

A "world publicity campaign" for donations is being launched. The names of the donors are to be enscribed on the stone walks of the temple. THE SYMBOLISM planned for the building dates back to the black magic practiced by the high priests of ancient Egypt. The building will contain a giant eye -- a circular pool of water which reflects light beamed onto it by a dome faceted to resemble a many-colored diamond. The Temple brochure states:
The dome will be illuminated all night in order to indicate, symbolically, that even while the world sleeps, the light of understanding continues to shine.
WHILE TEMPLE publicists proclaim the idea for the temple arose quite spontaneously out of a talk between two woman friends, shrines for "the brotherhood of man" have been systematically used throughout history to create a mystique of collectivity. Money was raised to build a similar shrine in London by the occultist, the late Mrs. Annie Besant. A sort of Eleanor Roosevelt of her day, Mrs. Besant worked closely with [Jawaharlal] Nehru and Krishna Menon and was a founder of the Fabian Parliamentary League, a British socialist group in which Sidney Webb, Hubert Land, H. H. Champion and Bernard Shaw were active. MRS. BESANT'S temple featured six symbolic presentations of the six great international faiths in the lecture hall. Visiting "adepts" contemplated a mural of a six-pointed Theosophical star made of two interlocking triangles connected by a serpent. This theme is repeated in the "Temple of Understanding." The brochure informs us that the temple's six wings "will contain the cultural facets of the 'diamond of truth.'" IN NEW YORK the "Friends of the Meditation Room" have long met regularly in the United Nations' Meditation Room. In the center of this shrine a beam of light plays of polished ore. On April 24, 1957, when the Meditation Room was reopened, the late Dag Hammarskjold, UN Secretary General, described this pagan stone as an altar to universal religion.
"The altar is the symbol of the God of all," he said.
The Temple of Understanding also will have its meditation room, to be known as the "Hall of Illumination." There, it is planned that the Illuminati, Masters of Wisdom*, Our Leaders of the Temple of Understanding, will train the public in the new humanistic cult.
* Mahatmas, or Masters of Wisdom To Helena Blavatsky the earlier civilizations such as the Egyptians and Greeks understood esoteric wisdom better than modern societies which made their teachings more proficient in the occult arts.
The teachers of this wisdom were the "Mahatmas" or Masters of Wisdom as they were known in India, lived on through centuries in various incarnations taught their profound knowledge to worthy students.
According to her, most of the Mahatmas lived in remote regions of Tibet, Mongolia, or India, forming the Brotherhood of Adepts. Such a concept of brotherhoods exists in numerous occult traditions. Helena claimed that two of the mahatmas (Koot Hoomi Lal Singh and Morya) were the real founders of the Theosophical Society. The Mahatmas frequently sent mysterious notes to officers of the Society and the disciples. Also, they dictated the various material which she later wrote into her books. A.G.H.
Meetings, film showings and courses of study in the world's great religions will be held in the "Hall of Illumination." IT IS INTERESTING to note that for some time now a group who call themselves "the New Group of World Servers" have been holding "full moon meditation meetings" at the Carnegie Endowment International Centre in New York. On Dec. 21, 1961, this writer attended one of these meetings where pamphlets were distributed describing "the New World Religion."
One " World Goodwill" booklet described what some of the backers of "The Temple of Understanding" may have in mind.
A new type of mystic is coming to be recognized... he distinguished by his lack of interest in his own brand of religious beliefs.
WHERE THE internationalist would-be elite gather to plan and plot world government I heard a determined group of "World Servers" led by Foster Bailey chant in unison their eerie Great Invocation.
Let purpose guide the little wills of menThe purpose which the Masters know and serve.
Is the real purpose of the world-minded Masters of Unism to guide and control us by pagan rites?
