If you still have money in European banks, you
need to get it out.
This is particularly true if you have money in
southern European banks. As I write this, the final details of the Cyprus
bailout are being worked out, but one thing has become abundantly clear: at
least some depositors are going to lose a substantial amount of money.
Personally, I never dreamed that they would go
after private bank accounts in Europe, but now that this precedent has been
set it should be apparent to everyone that no bank account
will ever be considered 100% safe ever
again.
Without trust, a banking system simply cannot
function, and right now there are prominent voices on both sides of the
Atlantic that are loudly warning that trust in the European banking system
has been shattered and that people need to get their money out of those
banks as rapidly as they can.
Even if you don't end up losing a significant
chunk of your money, you could still end up dealing with very serious
capital controls that greatly restrict what you are able to do with your
money. Just look at what is already
happening in Cyprus.
Cash withdrawals through ATMs have now been
limited to
100 Euros per day, and when the banks finally do reopen there will be
strict limits on financial transactions in order to prevent a full-blown
bank run. And of course anyone with half a brain will be trying to get as
much of their money as they can out of those banks once they do reopen.
So the truth is that the problems for Cyprus
banks are just beginning.
The size of the "bailout" that will be needed to
keep those banks afloat will just keep getting larger and larger the more
money that is withdrawn. Cyprus is heading for a complete and total banking
meltdown, and because the economy of the island is so dependent on banking
that means that the economy of the entire nation is going to collapse.
Sadly, similar scenarios will soon start playing
out all over Europe.
So if you hear that a "deal" has been reached to
"bail out" Cyprus, please keep in mind that the economy of Cyprus is going
to collapse no matter what happens. It is just a matter of apportioning the
pain at this point.
According to
the New York Times, it looks like much of the pain is going to be placed
on the backs of those with deposits of over 100,000 Euros...
The revised terms under discussion would
assess a one-time tax of 20 percent on deposits above 100,000 Euros at
the Bank of Cyprus, which has the largest number of savings accounts on
the island.
Because the Bank of Cyprus suffered huge
losses on bets that it took on Greek bonds, the government appears to be
taking depositors money to help plug the hole.
A separate tax of 4 percent would be
assessed on uninsured deposits at all other banks, including the 26
foreign banks that operate in Cyprus.
Does that sound bad to you? Well, if a deal is
not reached, there is a possibility that those with uninsured deposits could
lose everything.
According to
Ekathimerini, EU officials are telling Cyprus to choose between a "bad
scenario" and a "very bad scenario"...
The main question surrounds the future of
the islands largest lender, Bank of Cyprus.
If unsecured deposits
(above 100,000 Euros) at all Cypriot banks are taxed then large savings
at Bank of Cyprus are likely to be taxed between 20 and 25 percent. If
the levy is not imposed on deposits at other lenders, the haircut for
Bank of Cyprus customers will be much larger.
The option of a full bail in of Bank of
Cyprus depositors is still on the table. As with the Popular Bank of
Cyprus (Laiki), which is to go through a resolution process, the full
bail in option could lead to deposits above 100,000 Euros being lost.
The only compensation for unsecured
depositors will be shares in the good bank that will be created by a
possible merger between the "healthy" Laiki and Bank of Cyprus entities.
When asked by Kathimerini how the Cypriot
economy will survive if all company and personal deposits above 100,000
Euros disappear from the countrys two biggest lenders, the EU official
said:
Unfortunately, Cypruss choices are
between a bad scenario and a very bad scenario.
So what percentage of the deposits in Cyprus are
uninsured deposits?
Well, nobody knows for sure, but according to
JPMorgan close
to half of the total amount of money on deposit in EU banks as a whole
is uninsured. Do you think that some of those people will start moving their
money to safer locations after watching how things are going down in Cyprus?
They would be crazy if they didn't. And if you
think that "deposit insurance" will keep you safe, you are just being
delusional.
According to
CNBC,
very strict capital controls are coming to Cyprus.
These rules will apply even to accounts that
contain less than 100,000 Euros...
Financial controls are coming
Depositors with less than 100,000 Euros may
not lose their money outright, but they won't like the restrictions--no
matter how much they have in the bank.
Limits on withdrawals, limits on
check cashing, and perhaps even outright conversion of checking accounts
into fixed term deposits are coming (translation: you don't have a
checking account, you have a bond from the bank).
A lot of people are going to lose a lot of money
in Cyprus banks, and a significant percentage of them are going to be
Russian.
And as I wrote about
the other day, you don't want to have the Russians mad at you.
According to
the Guardian, Moscow is already considering various ways that it might
"punish" the EU...
However, with
Russian investors having an estimated 30bn (Â£26bn) deposited in banks
on the island, the growing optimism about a deal was accompanied by
fears of retaliation from Moscow.
Alexander Nekrassov, a former Kremlin
adviser, said:
"If it is the case that there will be a
25% levy on deposits greater than 100,000 then some Russians will
suffer very badly.
"Then, of course, Moscow will be looking
for ways to punish the EU. There are a number of large German
companies operating in Russia. You could possibly look at freezing
assets or taxing assets. The Kremlin is adopting a wait and see
policy."
Could this be the start of a bit of "economic
warfare" between east and west?
One thing is for sure - the Russians simply do
not allow people to walk all over them.
Meanwhile, things in Cyprus are getting more
desperate with each passing day. Because they cannot get money out of the
banks, many retail stores find themselves running
low on cash.
In a few more days many of them may not be able
to function at all...
Retailers, facing cash-on-delivery demands
from suppliers, warned stocks were running low.
"At the moment, supplies
will last another two or three days," said Adamos Hadijadamou, head of
Cyprus's Association of Supermarkets.
"We'll have a problem if this is
not resolved by next week."
But do you know who was able to get their money
out in time? The insiders.
According to
the Daily Mail, the President of Cyprus actually warned "close friends"
about what was going to happen and told them to get their money out
Cyprus...
Cypriot president Nikos Anastasiades
'warned' close friends of the financial crisis about to engulf his
country so they could move their money abroad, it was claimed on Friday.
Overall, approximately 4.5 billion Euros was
moved out of Cyprus during the week just before the crisis struck.
Wouldn't you like to get advance warning like
that? Well, at this point it does not take a genius to figure out what to do
about any money that you may have in European banks.
The following is from a recent
Forbes article by economist Laurence Kotlikoff...
Whatever happens, no one is going to trust
or use Cypriot banks.
This will shut down the countrys financial
highway and flip Cyprus economy to a truly awful equilibrium in a
replay of our own countrys Great Depression, which was kicked off by
the failure of one-in-three U.S. banks.
Cyprus is a small country. Still, the
failure of its banks could trigger massive bank runs in Greece. After
all, if the European Central Bank is abandoning Cypriot depositors, they
may abandon Greek depositors next.
A run on Greek banks could then spread to
Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Italy and from there to Belgium and France
and, you get the picture, to other countries around the globe,
including, drum roll, the U.S. Every bank in each of these countries
has made promises they cant keep were push come to shove, i.e., if all
depositors demand their money back immediately.
Weve seen this movie before. And not just
in real life. Every Christmas our tellys show Its a Wonderful Life
in which banker Jimmy Stewart barely saves his small town from economic
ruin arising from a banking panic.
Others are being even more blunt with their
warnings.
For example, Nigel Farage, a member of the
European Parliament, is
warning everyone to get their money out of southern European banks while
they still can...
The appalling events in Cyprus over the
course of the past week have surpassed even my direst of predictions.
Even I didnt think that they would stoop to
stealing money from peoples bank accounts. I find that astonishing.
There are 750,000 British people who own properties, or who live, many
of them in retirement down in Spain.
Our message to expats now that the EU has
crossed this line, must be: Get your money out of there while youve
still got a chance.
And
Martin Sibileau is proclaiming that if you still have an unsecured
deposit in a Eurozone bank that you should have your head examined...
What are depositors of Euros faced with
today? Anything but a clean bet!
They dont know what the expected loss
on their capital will be, because it will be decided over a weekend by
politicians who dont even represent them.
They dont really know where their deposits
went to and they also ignore what jurisdiction they really belong to.
Finally, depositors are paid mere basis points for their trust in the
system vs. the 20% p.a. Argentina offered in 2001 (thanks to the
zero-interest rate policies of the 21st century).
In light of all this, I can only conclude
that anyone still having an unsecured deposit in a Euro zone bank should
get his/her head examined!
So where should you put your money? I don't know that there is anywhere that is 100%
safe at this point.
But many are pointing to hard assets such as
gold and silver.
The following is what trends forecaster Gerald Celente had to say
during one recent interview...
"People always say to me,
Mr. Celente you are always talking
about gold. What are you going to do with gold when everything
collapses and there is no money?
Well, lets say you are a Cypriot and all of
the ATM machines are out of money and the banks are closed? Do you
think those pieces of silver are going to buy you what you need? Do you
think that ounce of gold is going to get you what you want?
Thats the real money. There is no other
money. When it all comes down, gold and silver are the only things you
have to buy what you need, get what you want, or even get out if you
need to."
I used to tell people that putting their money
in U.S. banks was safer than putting it other places because U.S. bank
deposits are covered by deposit insurance up to a certain amount.
But now we see that deposit insurance means
absolutely nothing. If they decide to "tax" (i.e. steal) your money from
your bank accounts they will just go ahead and do it.
So what should we all do?
Personally, I think that not having all of your
eggs in one basket is a wise approach. If you have your wealth a bunch of
different places and in several different forms, I think that will help.
But
as the global financial system falls apart, there will be no such thing
as 100% safety. So if you are looking for that you can stop trying.
Our world is becoming a very unstable place, and
things are going to get a lot worse.
We are all going to have to adjust to this new
paradigm and do the best that we can.
