Here in America people are beginning to
visualize what it will be like to overcome the mass political oppression we
are now all under at the hands of a small group of global control freak
elites who also control the money.
Yes, Americans are trying to imagine how the
scenario will play out.
Some still refuse to believe that this can
happen in our lifetime. They just cant imagine the bad guys having the
tables turned on them. Some consider it fantasy thinking, unrealistic pipe
dreams, or plain na√Øve to think this will ever happen.
Perhaps those voices are right so I propose we
assume nothing and instead admit we are dreaming or should we say, lets
just imagine what it would be like in the event humanitys mass
consciousness decides it doesnt want to live in slavery forever.
My story would begin in a large American city setting sometime in the not
too distant future; the local mainstream media now consists of mixed
elements of controlled opposition (looking out for the interests of the
mega-sized companies and their government business counterparts, who many
refer to as the globalists), and pro-freedom journalists looking to make a
difference.
Those looking to stay out of trouble with the
control system seek to maintain the great voices of control while those who
love freedom quietly wait for that big story that will put them in the
history books.
Others nervously watch along as world events
unfold on a daily bases.
The control system had
been seeking to continue censoring any news that made the implementation of
their control system more difficult. Reporters, writers, and journalists
everywhere, had begun realizing that the entire game is about control
and information censoring and now many were seeking to quietly break
away from
the journalistic matrix that had been
created for them.
Meanwhile unhappy Americans had finally come to grips with their own
struggles. Many were now poised to do whatever it takes to trigger change.
They had now realized the truth of their pain had reached a level that was
no longer possible to ignore.
Americans had failed to realize that similar
revolutions had been
going on around the world for many years
while most Americans were kept busy with entertainment. This new unrest had
brought back memories of the Occupy Wall Street revolution only this
revolution was more intense and more meaningful.
The federal government continued its routine control of news items.
The censorship of subject matters made it
impossible for journalists to cover certain stories for fear of government
retribution. The pressure to comply had now become the do or die decision
for journalists and reporters who were hoping to make a difference and those
looking to fan the flames of freedom. With larger and more potentially
historic stories on the table, reporters started making personal decisions
to cover and disseminate stories that were outside the spectrum of what they
were told to cover.
The legend of the brave hearted and courageous
freedom fighters had emerged. Realizing that heroes of today fight with
their brain, their intelligence, their skills, and combine that with their
courage, the heroes of today emerged.
They began to realize that the paradigm had
truly began to shift.
We were once a species that relied on might and
force, then we relied on guns then weapons of mass destruction, fear, and
intimidation to bully each other around, but now we were a species that was
able to solve all of its problems by thinking together, working together,
getting along with one another, and realizing that this final battle for
humanity will be decided by how we synchronize our brain waves
together.
The control system used psychological tactics to create their control over
humanity. They learned how to manipulate the other humans with visual,
audio, and other physiological stimuli, but the species eventually used its
own intellectual abilities to solve its own problem.
The solution? Information and sharing
information to expose what was wrong and how to fix it.
That revelation compelled many to want to become
independent journalists realizing that we were in the middle of a prophetic
world war scenario that would determine the future of humanity.
The instrument needed by humanity? Journalist
information soldiers! More and more people acting as journalist and sharing
and reporting information critical to the advancement of humanity.
The concept of news was now being defined as
that which positively advances the state of humanity.
This mindset (of sharing important
information) turned out to hold one of the keys to the overall solution. The
solution, it would turn out, was hidden inside the human genome and
behavioral blueprint. The human blueprint held many of the mysteries and
answers to life. It would explain how diverse we are and how capable we are
of doing not only evil things but of also restoring that which is broken or
destroyed.
We discovered that as a whole we have the
healing force in us that allows us to create brand new solutions to almost
any problem that comes our way. We are now seeing why it is that humanity
lives on and survives historic event after event and continues to find
solutions for all of its challenges.
This solution (of becoming journalists and information sharing vessels)
pushed the door open at multiple levels within the control system itself to
offer a change in consciousness from within the very control system.
This turned out to be possible because many good
people with a conscience and with incredible skills, intelligence,
organization, and discipline were the ones who were in place helping to
operate the control system to begin with.
So as the list of arrests began accumulating it seemed to have a magical
effect on humanity.
Why would the announcement of an arrest of a
high ranking corporate officer make a journalist excited? Maybe because with
every arrest came a dream perhaps a hope that each arrest represented the
beginning of the end of the worst era in American history.
With every indictment, arrest, and every court
decision that swung in favor of justice, humanity started feeling that weird
adrenalin of historic proportion that told us better days were coming.
Guarding carefully against a false or premature
freedom honeymoon celebration, many freedom fighting intellectuals and
activists reminded the masses of the evils that were still occurring. This
refusal to celebrate too soon turned out to be one of the most
important elements that allowed those fighting for freedom to ultimately
prevail on many levels even if not on all levels.
The oppression of America had now been going on long enough that every
American you met had a personal story related to what would now be known
forever as the second American Revolution of the 21st
century.
Yes, it took many Americans decades to realize
what it was. Many had already died. Everyone now had a story to tell about
someone they knew who was a revolutionary who got started by simply
sharing information.
Thanks to
the
Internet age and a few courageous people, the revolution moved
faster than planned and humanity was saved for the moment.
Yes many will remember names like,
...and many other individuals who contributed
something to this battle for freedom.
The list of heroes became very long, everyone
seemed to know someone who belonged on the never-ending freedom hero list.
This is where humanity needed to be to realize that it was humanity itself
that was allowing the control system to succeed. Humanity was told from the
beginning that this was a system of control that operated by consent of the
governed.
The tipping point came and went, the long
awaited mass arrest was more like a gradual arrest as many of the war
criminals of old, being so old either turned themselves in, were forcefully
arrested or died off.
Yes, the younger global elite organization
was able to see an alternate way of moving forward in a way that does not
guarantee defeat and mass ending to most of humanity as their forefathers
had planned.
Facing the grim reality of
exterminating so much of humanity proved impossible and much more
difficult on the conscience than their forefathers thought. Some called it
the progress of humanity, others called it justice as the
story broke about a certain known politicians decision to not receive life
support.
The news broke on mainstream media news. The man
who it was believed singlehandedly
pioneered numerous crimes and war crimes
with the approval of his inner circle.
The symbolism of mass arrest was now somehow
etched in this image being shown around the world.
The first coverage of the story comes from
alternative media, now considered by most the new unofficial mainstream
media, before its picked up reluctantly by the larger networks who had
traditionally been considered the mainstream media.
To this day many had attributed the long debated
inner conflict within
the CIA structure which had led to mass
breakdown of CIA control programs, for the final deflation of what had been
the traditional mainstream media networks.
The CIAs inability to recreate itself and
effectively implement new mass mind control strategies within the usual
media platforms proved their demise. Perhaps it was Snowdens fault for
creating the trend that made it appear too fashionable for agents to abandon
their oath of secrecy and obedience.
Was the CIA conspiracy planned by Snowden and
others or a byproduct of the awakening of humanity?
Some insisted that part of the problem for the
control system was their repeated use of the same script when pulling off
false
flag events. Eventually they used the script too many times and
many had blamed the CIA and FBI for this sloppiness which led to the general
public being able to predict every single event in real-time thus severely
weakening their control.
The truth about this would be discussed and
debated for many years to come.
Meanwhile a man somewhere in a hospital bed lies watching the news on TV,
terminally ill from poison imposed on him by the control system, he drops
his head back in deep thought. 'Oh my god, this is the day Ive been waiting
for.'
He takes a deep breath and gazes out to the
window where a blue sky can be seen
without any white lines in the sky as far
as the eye can see. He takes another deep breath, smiles in content and is
later not seen to move again.
A call can be heard for a nurse. The moment had
passed.
All that was left was the dead man lying next to
his American flag.
