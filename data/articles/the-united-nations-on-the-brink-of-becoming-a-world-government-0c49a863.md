On October 14, 2009, Lord Christopher
Monckton, former science advisor to British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, delivered a scathing refutation of the concept of
'human-caused'
global warming at Bethel University in St. Paul, Minnesota.
During his presentation, Lord Monckton focused
on the UN climate treaty that was being proposed for the United Nations
Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen that December.
He warned:
I read that treaty. And what it says is this:
that a world government is going to be created. The word government
actually appears as the first of three purposes of the new entity.
The second purpose is the transfer of wealth
from the countries of the West to third world countries.... And the third
purpose of this new entity, this government, is enforcement.
Not just any government, mind you.
They are about to impose a communist world
government on the world, warned Monckton.
At the UNs
Rio+20 Earth Summit on Sustainable
Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, the world government
advocates were pushing even grander schemes.
Lord Monckton, who heads the policy unit of the
U.K. Independence Party and is chief policy advisor to the Washington,
D.C.-based Science and Public Policy Institute, told The New Americans Alex
Newman,
They were still effectively talking about a
mechanization for setting up a global government so that they could shut
down the West, shut down democracy, and bring freedom to an end
worldwide.
Is that merely the ranting of a madman?
Thats what the usual suspects at the Huffington
Post, MSNBC, and other organs of the liberal-left corporate media would have
us believe.
He is a climate-change denier, a moonbat,
a conspiracy wacko.
That is the same response that has greeted
anyone and everyone who has dared not merely to criticize the United
Nations faults and abuses, but to point out the danger of a UN that is
evolving into an actual world government - with real teeth and enforcement
powers.
However, very influential Americans, as well as foreign leaders, in
politics, media, and academe, have been advocating - blatantly and openly,
as well as indirectly - for transforming the United Nations system into a
full-blown world government. Whats more, they have begun actual
implementation.
It is no longer hypothetical that the UN and its
affiliated institutions will usurp legislative, executive, and judicial
powers, including taxing, policing, and military powers. It has already
begun; it is already happening.
And it is happening with the acquiescence,
approval, encouragement, and funding of globalists in our own government,
both Republicans and Democrats.
Walter Cronkite, the late CBS anchorman and broadcast icon often
referred to as the most trusted man in America, stated in 1999:
It seems to many of us that if we are to avoid
the eventual catastrophic world conflict we must strengthen
the
United Nations as a first step toward a world government with a
legislature, executive and judiciary, and police to enforce its
international laws and keep the peace.
To do that, of course, we Americans will have to
yield up some of our sovereignty. It would take a lot of courage, a lot of
faith in the new order...
We cannot defer this responsibility to
posterity. Democracy, civilization itself, is at stake. Within the next few
years we must change the basic structure of our global community from the
present anarchic system of war
to a new system governed by a democratic
U.N. federation.
Cronkite made that statement in a 1999 speech to
the World Federalist Association, one of the oldest and foremost
organizations promoting
world government.
Strobe Talbott may not be as well known as Uncle Walter Cronkite,
but he wields considerable influence among political elites.
A former Soviet expert and correspondent for
Time magazine (Soviet KGB defector Sergei Tretyakov claimed Talbott
was actually an extremely valuable intelligence source for Russian
intelligence) and deputy secretary of state for President Clinton, Talbott
now serves as president of the very influential think tank, the Brookings
Institution, in Washington, D.C.
In a highly acclaimed essay he penned for Time in 1992, entitled The
Birth of the Global Nation, Talbott declared:
In 1795 [philosopher Immanuel] Kant advocated a
peaceful league of democracies. But it has taken the events in our own
wondrous and terrible century to clinch the case for world government.
Federalism has already proved the most successful of all political
experiments, and organizations like the World Federalist Association have
for decades advocated it as the basis for global government.
Gideon Rachman, an enthusiastic one-worlder
and a leading economic opinionator for the very influential
Financial Times, authored a Times op-ed on December 8, 2008
entitled, And
Now for a World Government, in which he approvingly observed:
So, it seems, everything is in place. For the
first time since homo sapiens began to doodle on cave walls, there is an
argument, an opportunity and a means to make serious steps towards a world
government.
Rachman was excited that the global financial
crisis was presenting a rich opportunity so that,
for the first time in my life, I think the
formation of some sort of world government is plausible.
Rachman described the desideratum that he and
fellow internationalists are working so hard to bring about:
A world government would involve much more
than co-operation between nations. It would be an entity with state-like
characteristics, backed by a body of laws. The European Union has already
set up a continental government for 27 countries, which could be a model.
The EU has a supreme court, a currency,
thousands of pages of law, a large civil service and the ability to deploy
military force.
Similarly blatant calls for empowering the
United Nations could be cited ad infinitum.
But the fact is that the empowerment is already
well under way.
Hiding in Plain
Sight
Much of the superstructure and infrastructure for the physical edifice of a
world government already have been built.
The United Nations official organizational
chart and the world map (click below image) give an ominous inkling of the
global leviathan that is already in place:
United Nations Map
But only an inkling; it actually vastly
understates the magnitude of the organizational sprawl of the UN
worldwide, since it merely shows the locations of the headquarters offices
of the main UN agencies and only a few of the many regional offices or field
operations of these agencies.
Take, for instance, the UNs World Health Organization (WHO).
In addition to its mammoth Geneva headquarters,
it also has six huge regional offices:
-
Africa HQ (Brazzaville, Congo)
-
the Americas HQ (Washington, D.C.)
-
Europe HQ (Copenhagen, Denmark)
-
Eastern Mediterranean HQ (Cairo, Egypt)
-
Southeast Asia HQ (Delhi, India)
-
Western Pacific HQ (Manila, Philippines)
Likewise, the UNs Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO)
is located in a huge gleaming palace of glass and marble a short walk from
the Colosseum in Rome.
But it also has,
-
regional offices in Ghana, Chile,
Thailand, Egypt, and Hungary
-
subregional offices in Samoa, Barbados,
Tunisia, Turkey, Ethiopia, Gabon, and Panama
-
liaison offices in Geneva; Washington,
D.C.; New York; Brussels; and Yokohama
The story is similar at UNESCO, which, besides
boasting a palatial edifice in Paris, called the World Heritage Center,
has field offices, cluster offices, national offices, regional bureaus, and
liaison offices in more than 50 countries throughout the world.
This same pattern is repeated for many other UN
agencies.
Besides putting in place a vast civil service of administrators and
bureaucrats to run the planned world government, the ever-expanding UN
system has created a huge global constituency of local and national
politicians, corporations, and NGOs that benefits from the UNs presence and
can be counted on to lobby for its continued expansion.
Gideon Rachmans statement above referring approvingly to the European Union
(EU) as a model for the UN is particularly apropos.
For decades, critics of the Common Market (as
the EU was called before 1993) warned that the organization was being built
piece by piece, agency by agency, into a supranational government, only to
be derided as paranoid wackos by EU proponents.
Now, of course, all pretenses are being dropped
because the EU is de facto a supranational government that
completely overrides the national and local governments of its member
states.
The UNs rapidly growing organizational footprint is most jarringly visible
throughout the Third World, where offices of,
-
UN agencies
-
the IMF
-
the World Bank,
...dominate the political and economic
landscape, and,
...are ubiquitous.
The gradual development of the UN from an international organization into a
world government was planned from the world bodys beginning in 1945. One of
the UN architects at the UN founding conference in San Francisco was John
Foster Dulles, who served as U.S. secretary of state from 1953 to 1959.
In his 1950 book, War or Peace, Dulles,
a committed one-worlder and a founder of the one-world
Council on Foreign Relations, wrote of the then-five-year-old UN:
The United Nations represents not a final
stage in the development of world order, but only a primitive stage.
Therefore its primary task is to create the conditions which will make
possible a more highly developed organization.
Later in the same book, Dulles stated:
I have never seen any proposal made for
collective security with teeth in it, or for world government or for
world federation, which could not be carried out either by the United
Nations or under the United Nations Charter.
The UNs New World Order
The push to empower the UN with global legislative, executive, and judicial
powers has already yielded huge dividends, and UN bodies are now exercising
those powers to various degrees - and constantly pushing to usurp more
control.
Here is a brief survey.
-
The Global Army
On its Web page entitled Honoring 60
Years of United Nations Peacekeeping (1948-2008) the UN makes this
ominous boast:
A massive enterprise - The UN is the
largest multilateral contributor to post-conflict stabilization
worldwide. Only the United States deploys more military
personnel to the field than the United Nations.
There are almost 110,000 serving on 20 peace operations led by the
UN Departments of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and Field Support (DFS)
on four continents directly impacting the lives of hundreds of
millions of people.
This represents a seven-fold
increase in UN peacekeepers since 1999.
The United States picks up 27 percent of
the direct tab for UN peacekeeping operations, but that is only a
fraction of the American contribution.
Through the Global Peace Operations
Initiative (GPOI) and the African Contingency Operations Training
and Assistance (ACOTA) program, both operated jointly by the U.S.
Departments of State and Defense, the U.S. military has trained (and
continues to train) tens of thousands of UN peacekeepers, many of
whom have been charged with carrying out genocide and atrocities,
including widespread rape and sodomizing of women and children, as
well as sexploitation of impoverished children in Haiti, Ivory
Coast, Liberia, Congo, Somalia, and Kosovo.
An even larger chunk of UN war-making
disguised as peacekeeping is carried out under the auspices of
NATO - again, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers and U.S. armed forces.

The Global
Prosecutor, Judge, and Jury
The UNs International Criminal Court
(ICC) officially opened its doors at The Hague 10 years ago, in July
2002.
The UN boasts that the ICC has become a
fully functional institution, with 16 cases having been brought
before the Court, 6 of which are at the trial stage. ICC judges have
issued 22 arrest warrants and 6 arrests have been made.
Although most of those targeted thus far
are generally recognized as bad men, the ICCs prosecutions are
establishing dangerous precedents that could be used against
innocent political targets, including American citizens.
The ICCs governing Rome Statute
violates the most basic principles of due process, separation of
powers, and national sovereignty. It incorporates within the ICC
itself the roles of prosecutor, judge, and jury.
Notre Dame University Law Professor Charles Rice called the ICC a
monstrosity.
Ambassador David Scheffer, the pro-ICC
negotiator for President Bill Clinton, admitted, it is not credible
to argue
that no American will ever come before it. We are not
saying Americans are off bounds.
The danger is not that Americans (U.S. military personnel,
law-enforcement officers, elected officials, or private citizens)
will be taken before the ICC against the wishes of the U.S.
government, but that our own government officials will acquiesce in
the process, arguing that we must uphold the rule of law and the
will of the international community.
-
The Global Taxman
World government advocates have long
lamented that the UN must depend on dues and contributions from its
member states.
Their dream of a UN that will have an
independent revenue stream from global taxes is dangerously close at
hand. The controversy and opposition caused by the European Unions
imposition of a carbon tax on all air travel has given the UN
leverage to propose its own global carbon tax on all air passengers,
through the UNs International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
However, many other global tax proposals
are in the works, with a global financial transaction tax (FTT)
being, perhaps, the one closest to realization and receiving major
backing from many leaders of the G-20 nations and the NGO lobby.
Various FTT proposals, such as the
Tobin Tax, could net the UN
hundreds of billions of dollars annually.
The usual rationale given for an FTT is
that the proceeds would be used to end global poverty, but the UNs
record indicates the massive sums taken would end up in the bank
accounts of the UNs corrupt officials.
-
The Global Fed
The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World
Bank (WB) have wrought
economic havoc worldwide for decades, burdening nations (especially
the less-developed countries) with impossible debt and onerous
economic policies.
Over the last several years, a growing
chorus of globalists has called for transforming and supersizing
the IMF into the equivalent of a global Federal Reserve, with a
global currency -
SDRs, Special Drawing Rights
- to displace the dollar.
In 2010, the UN issued its World
Economic and Social Survey, which said:
A new global reserve system could
be created, one that no longer relies on the United States
dollar as the single major reserve currency.
According to the UN report, a new
reserve system should permit the emission of international
liquidity - such as SDRs - to create a more stable global financial
system.
A global currency would allow whoever controls the currency (in this
case the IMF) to control the world economy and to enjoy unlimited
financial power. And it could bail out or subsidize any company it
wishes, to the detriment of other companies.
Like a global Federal Reserve, it could
confiscate wealth by simply inflating the currency.
-
The Global Trade
Cop
The World Trade Organization (WTO),
which entered into force in 1995, has joined NAFTA (the North
American Free Trade Agreement) in judging and overturning U.S. laws
and court decisions.
The WTO has already proven the charges
by its critics and opponents, that it is an enormous threat to
Americas national sovereignty, as well as an engine of global
central economic planning.
Make no mistake about it, warned
Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) in 2005, WTO ministers tell Congress to
change American laws, and Congress complies. In fact,
congressional leaders obediently scrambled to make sure the
corporate tax bill passed before a WTO deadline. Thousands and
thousands of bills languish in committees, yet a bill ordered by
the WTO was pushed to the front of the line.
-
The Global Enviro-Cop
Through a multitude of environmental
agreements, programs, and agencies,
-
Agenda 21
-
the Biodiversity Treaty
-
UN Convention on Climate Change
-
the United Nations Environment
Program
-
the Global Environment Facility,
...etc. - the UN and its one-world
advocates are spinning a web of control over all human activity.
As in the case of other global taxes and
regulations, the UN depends on national governments to be complicit
in adopting international norms and commitments that will lock
individual nations into the UNs regulatory grip.
-
The Global Gun
Grabber
Through its Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)
and its Program of Action (PoA) on Small Arms, the United
Nations has been pushing feverishly for over a decade and a half to
undermine the right of individuals to possess firearms, as
guaranteed in the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment.
The UN attack is aimed not only at
infringing the right of private gun ownership, but also increasing
restrictions on ammunition, gunpowder, and other essential
components.
In August 2012, the UN began its latest
round of efforts to attack this fundamental right, asserting the
claimed right of the state to have an unchallengeable monopoly of
force.
It is not surprising that the United
States is virtually the sole holdout, as most UN member states are
either dictatorships that do not allow individuals to possess
firearms, or socialist countries traveling the same direction on the
road to tyranny.
-
The Global
Internet Controller
Since at least 2003, when the United
Nations hosted its first World Summit on the Information Society,
the UN has been leading an effort to
take over the Internet.
The countries in the forefront of this
effort are,
-
Russia
-
China
-
Iran
-
North Korea
-
Cuba
-
Sudan
-
Tajikistan
-
Uzbekistan,
...dictatorships where Internet
censorship and cyber spying on citizens are standard operating
procedures.
Insatiable
Globocrats
The UN grabs for power cited above are far from a complete list.
The UNs Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST)
aims to give the UN authority over the planets,
The UNs World Health Organization and
Food & Agriculture Organization are in charge of
the
Codex Alimentarius, the UN effort to
regulate and take control over raw food, processed food, and semi-processed
food, including vitamin and mineral supplements, herbs, and other
nutritional products.
UNESCO has insinuated itself into American
schools and families through partnerships with our federal and state
Education Departments that include curriculum design and invasive,
psychologically manipulative emotional wellness evaluations.
The UN Population Fund (UNFPA)
not only supports forced abortion in China, but works assiduously with
Planned Parenthood to overturn national
abortion laws and make abortion legal and commonplace worldwide.
The list goes on and on - and on.
If any human condition or domain of human
activity, any potential crisis, or any particle or parcel of the Earth,
sea, or sky has been overlooked by the UN, one can be sure the omission will
soon be corrected, and that a new UN commission, agency, and/or treaty will
soon be initiated to claim responsibility and jurisdiction over it.
