These days, reading some of the Western
corporate
propaganda media, you get the feeling you
are reading Axis news reports of imminent victory late during World War 2.
The reality people can see with their own eyes
contradicts their reports so much that only a diehard rump of the most
thoroughly brainwashed now really believes the propaganda. No matter what
wishful thinking headlines they conjure up about
the IMF coming to the rescue, or the Feds
printing more dollars or
FRNs coming to the rescue, the fact of the
matter is that the cabal that hijacked the worlds financial system has
lost.
The criminal cabal is caput.
Events this week and next will provide ample proof of this.
Both behind the scenes and in public, the worlds law enforcement agencies
continue to close in on the criminal cabal from all directions. The big
lawsuit expected next week against the cabal has now obtained as evidence
something known as the 'Book of Maklumat.'
This is a book that details the historical
ownership of much of
the worlds gold by a group of Asian royal
families.
They also have copies of the original cash
certificates and evidence of how this money was transferred to the
custodianship of the Government of United States for the use on behalf of
the international community.
This evidence is icing on the cake in a lawsuit
that will prove the private owners of
the
Federal Reserve Board stole this money and have been using it
illegally for over 50 years.
That is why the illegal trading platforms that were being used to steal
this money have been shut down. That, in turn, is why the International
Monetary Fund, the European governments and the Federal Reserve Board have
been powerless to stop the ongoing crisis affecting the G5 group of
terrorist states,
-
France
-
England
-
Italy
-
Germany
-
the United States,
...as well as their armed camp known as
Israel.
Although these governments have threatened Greeces government into stopping
a referendum on the Euro, they cannot take their threats to the bank.
The fact is that the European fascists do not
have the money to help,
-
Italy
-
Ireland
-
Portugal
-
Spain
-
the five Baltic states
Furthermore, the government of Ireland has
already asked the European bankers to prove Ireland is in debt to them, show
where the money came from, prove that it is real and prove they have the
legal rights to it.
This is something they cannot do which is why
Ireland is not in the headlines. It is also one of the reasons they have
shut down Irelands Vatican embassy.
Although the G5 and Israel threaten to ignite World War 3 by
attacking
Iran, that is a suicidal bluff. The commanders of the US, Chinese
and Russian militaries will not let this happen. These rogue G5 leaders
are, of course, terrified because they know they have committed countless
crimes against humanity (e.g. hundreds of millions of murders since World
War 2 ended).
It may still be possible for most of them to
obtain forgiveness via a truth and reconciliation committee but the window
of opportunity is shutting fast.
One man who has now put himself beyond the pale is
Henry
Kissinger.
Kissinger last week desperately tried to orchestrate a series of
assassinations in the hope of somehow turning the situation around. This
writer was once again last week targeted by people hired by Kissinger.
However, Kissinger has been told to back off and his orders are not being
obeyed.
President
Obama, for his part, was the subject of
severe verbal attacks at last weeks G20 meeting in France. He was told the
United States was in far worse shape than Europe and that he had a lot of
the blame for that, according to sources at the meeting. Obama is no longer
expected to be able to complete his term as President because of the various
legal actions against his regime.
In Japan, meanwhile, there has been a lot of rumbling under the surface.
Senior Japanese right wing sources say that a group of Colonels in the
Japanese Self-Defense forces are plotting a military coup detat. Their plan
is to put in former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as their leader. Abe,
of course, is linked to the Moonies, who in turn have a ranch next to
the Bush ranch in Paraguay. They are also
linked to the international drug business.
Needless to say, these misguided Colonels have been educated and are now
realizing that no matter how honorable their wish to help Japan might be,
they were about to be manipulated by the very people who helped ruin Japans
economy.
Another move in Japan came as US CIA and Pentagon types told power broker
Ichiro Ozawa to permanently cease his plans to try to take over the
government if he wished to stay alive. Ozawa is not trusted because of both
his
Rockefeller and cabal connections.
It is also worth noting that Emperor Akihito is suffering from
Bronchitis, and has thus temporarily handed over control to crown prince
Naruhito, according to the Royal Household Agency.
The official go-ahead has now been given for a new International Economic
Planning Agency.
Its motto will be we turn dreams into
reality.
