Americans, Britons, French, Turks Oppose War Against
Syria
A new Pew poll shows that
70% of Americans oppose arming the Syrian "rebels". As the
Washington Post
notes:
Opposition in the Pew poll is
actually higher than ever before in the two-year-old civil war. And
thats even as
much of the poll was conducted after the White House announced
Thursday that the Syrian government had crossed the "red line" and
used chemical weapons.
But while the red line was significant
to the White House, it doesnt seem
to have altered the perceptions of the American people.
(In fact, the weight of evidence shows that
it was likely the rebels - not the Syrian government - which used
chemical weapons. See
this,
this,
this and
this.)
Numerous other recent polls show that
Americans on both sides of the aisle are opposed to war in Syria.
Likewise, the Herald Scotland
reports:
More pressure has been piled on
David Cameron with a poll showing most Britons are opposed to
arming the Syrian rebels
The Comres survey showed only 17% of
people supported the UK Government arming the Syrian opposition
to the Assad regime but 53% were opposed.
Polls have consistently shown that the
French people oppose arming the rebels.
As do the Turks.
Public opposition wont stop the war, of
course. For example, the protests against the Iraq war were the
largest protests in history. But the U.S. and its allies had
reasons to invade, anyway.
And
Americans were opposed to the "humanitarian"
war in Libya
even before they learned that the U.S. and its allies
had backed Al Qaeda to topple Gaddafi.
But we went in anyway.
Likewise, Syria has
long been on the list of
countries which "need"
regime change
whether or not the people want it.
