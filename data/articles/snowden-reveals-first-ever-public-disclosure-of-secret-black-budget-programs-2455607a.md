Edward Snowden, a former intelligence
contractor has leaked the very first documentation that proves the
existence of clandestine black budget operations
(1)(programs
that are extremely classified dealing with technology, information and
more.) Did we really need this leak in order to believe that black
budget programs operate in secrecy? No, many people will tell you that
the existence of black budget programs was obvious and that we didnt
need any official documentation to prove it, but this still helps. The
United States has a history of government agencies existing in secret
for years. The National Security Agency (NSA) was founded in 1952, its
existence was hidden until the mid 1960′s. Even more secretive is the
National Reconnaissance Office, which was founded in 1960 but remained
completely secret for 30 years.
We are talking about Special Access Programs
(SAP). From these we have unacknowledged and waived SAPs. These programs
do not exist publicly, but they do indeed exist. They are better known
as deep black programs. A 1997 US Senate report described them as "so
sensitive that they are exempt from standard reporting requirements to
the Congress." (0)(8)
The Washington Post revealed that the
"black-budget" documents report a staggering 52.6 billion dollars that
was set aside for operations in the fiscal year 2013. Although its
great to have this type of documentation in the public domain proving
the existence of these black budget programs, the numbers seem to be
off according to some statements made by some very prominent people who
have been involved in the defense sector for years. There is a lot of
evidence to suggest that these programs are not using billions of
dollars, but trillions of dollars that are unaccounted for. Here is a
statement given by Canadas former Minister of National Defence, Paul
Hellyer in 2008:
It is ironic that the U.S. would
begin a devastating war, allegedly in search of weapons of mass
destruction when the most worrisome developments in this field are
occurring in your own backyard. It is ironic that the U.S. should
be fighting monstrously expensive wars allegedly to bring democracy
to those countries, when it itself can no longer claim to be called
a democracy when trillions, and I mean thousands of billions of
dollars have been spent on projects which both congress and the
commander in chief no nothing about(2)
We are talking about large amounts of
unaccounted-for money going into programs we know nothing about. There
have been several congressional inquiries that have noted billions, and
even trillions of dollars that have gone missing from the federal
reserve system. On July 16, 2001, in front of the house appropriations
committee, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated:
The financial systems of the
department of defence are so snarled up that we cant account for
some $2.6 trillion in transactions that exist, if thats believable (3)
We dont really hear about black budget
programs, or about people who have actually looked into them. However,
the topic was discussed in 2010 by Washington Post journalists Dana
Priest and William Arkin. Their investigation lasted approximately two
years and concluded that Americas classified world has:
Become so large, so unwieldy and
so secretive that no one knows how much money it costs, how many
people it employes, how many programs exist within it or exactly how
many agencies do the same work (4)
Another person was aviation journalist Bill
Sweetman. Within the Pentagon, he estimated that approximately 150
special access programs existed that werent even acknowledged. These
programs are not known about by the highest members of government and
the highest ranking officials in the military. He determined that most
of these programs were dominated by private contractors (Lockheed
Martin, Boeing, etc.) and that he had no idea as to how these programs
were funded(5)(8).
Dwight Eisenhower, former 5 star U.S.
general (highest possible rank) and President of the United States also
warned us about secrecy and the acquisition of unwarranted influence
within the "department of defence" with his farewell speech:
In the council of government, we
must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether
sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The
potential disaster of the rise of mis placed power exists, and will
persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger
our liberties or democratic processes(6)
He warns us about the influence of the
military industrial complex, and the influence and power its capable
of. After Eisenhower the next and only other president that blew the
whistle on secrecy beyond the government was president John F. Kennedy
in one of his most famous speeches, he is also referring to the military
industrial complex:
The very word secrecy is
repugnant, in a free and open society. And we are as a people
inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, secret
oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the
dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts
far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even
today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed
society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there
is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our
traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger
that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by
those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official
censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the
extent that it is in my control. We are opposed around the world by
a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert
means for expanding its sphere of influence. On Infiltration instead
of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation
instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by
day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material
resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient
machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic,
scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed,
not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its
dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned,
no rumour is printed, no secret is revealed (7)
The amount that the US sets aside for
sensitive operations each year is not allowed to be published for eyes
outside of the intelligence community. We are in an age where the US is
having a difficult time keeping sensitive information under wraps, and
although there is an abundance of blatant information for the world to
wake up to, that which is still kept under tight wraps has also become
more transparent. Many phenomena previously labelled as merely a
"conspiracy theory" are now surfacing as true and verifiable day after
day.
Could some of these black budget programs be
dealing with UFOs? There is a large amount of evidence to suggest that
they do, and possibly even extraterrestrials. Documents from the NSA
prove that UFOs and extraterrestrials are of high interest to the agency(9)(10).
In fact I would like to mention that there is an overwhelming amount of
evidence to suggest that these black budget programs deal with matters
beyond our world. Garry
McKinnon has also shed light on this fact, as have thousands of
previously classified documents and statements from high level
government and military personnel. The world within our own world must
be quite fascinating, the fact that we are living in the time of
transparency must mean that the truth cannot stay hidden forever.

Richard Dolans Thoughts
on the "Breakaway
Civilization"
By now, the classified world has moved far
beyond the reach of the public world, and far beyond in its power and
capabilities. Consider the story of a former NSA scientist who spoke
with the authors. According to this individual, the NSA was operating
computers during the mid-1960s with a processing clock-speed of roughly
650 megahertz(MHZ). To put that in perspective, it took 35 years for
personal computers in the consumer market to reach that speed. Indeed,
in 1965 there were no personal computers at all. Immediately, the
near-fatal Apollo 13 mission in 1971 comes to mind, with its reliance on
slide-rulers by mission specialist to guide the damaged NASA spacecraft
back to Earth. When presented with this image, the NSA scientist
shrugged and stated that secret computational capabilities were too
important to share with NASA. So in, in computing, the National Security
Agency was an amazing 35 years ahead of the rest of the world. This
leads one to wonder what its computational powers are today.
Another example was the U.S. air strike
against Libya in 1986. The raid employed f-111 fighter aircraft. Left
out of the mission, however, was the F-117A Nighthawk, better known as
the stealth fighter. It had been operational since 1983, but was still
classified in 1986. In a form of logic both perverse and rational, the
F-117A was so radically advanced that keeping it secret was more
important than using it for this military mission.
Given the mixture of a treasure chest of
government money, and private connections, the likelihood exists that
six decades later there is a clandestine group that possesses:
-
Technology that is vastly superior to
that of the "mainstream" world.
-
The ability to explore areas of our
world and surroundings presently unavailable to the rest of us.
-
Scientific and cosmological
understandings that give them greater insights into the nature of
our world
-
A significant "built off the grid"
infrastructure, partially underground, that affords them a high
degree of secrecy and independence of action
This might well qualify them as a separate
civilization - one that has broken away from our own, in effect, a
breakaway civilization. Still interacting with our own, its members
probably move back and forth between the official reality of what we are
supposed to believe, and the other reality which encompasses new truths
and challenges.
