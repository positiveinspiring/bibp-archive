On November 23, 2011, a lawsuit of unprecedented
proportions was filed with the U.S. District Court in the Southern District
of New York.
The lawsuit, filed by Neil Keenan who is acting as a
representative of the Dragon Family, takes aim at a variety of well-known
individuals and institutions that span the entire globe and encompass both
the public and private sectors.
The Plaintiff, Neil Keenan, claims that he was entrusted back in 2009 with
financial instruments which included Federal Reserve Notes worth $124.5
billion, two Japanese government bonds which have a combined face value of
$19 billion, and a U.S. Kennedy bond which carries a face value of $1
billion by The Dragon Family, a group of very wealthy and reclusive Asian
families.
According to the lawsuit, the accrued interest value of these instruments
alone was $1 trillion back in 2009, when the alleged crime against Keenan
(and hence the Dragon Family) occurred.

filed on November 23, 2011.
As reported by Dan McCue of Courthouse News Service, the only mainstream
news organization to cover this lawsuit to date,
In his remarkable
complaint, Keenan claims that the U.S. government [received] enormous
amounts of money - delivered in gold and other precious metals - from the
Dragon Family many years ago, and that the money was placed into the Federal
Reserve System for the benefit and underwriting support of the dollar,
which was to become and currently remains the global reserve currency.
Keenan further describes the Dragon Family in his lawsuit by stating that:
The Dragon Family abstains from public view and knowledge, but, upon
information and belief, acts for the good and better benefit of the world in
constant coordination with higher levels of global financial organizations,
in particular, the Federal Reserve System.
During the course of its existence over the last century, the Dragon family
has accumulated great wealth by having provided the Federal Reserve Bank and
the United States Government with Asset assignments of gold and silver via
certain accounts held in Switzerland, for which it has received
consideration in the form of a variety of Notes, Bonds, and Certificates
such as those described.. that are an obligation of the Federal Reserve
System.
However, the lawsuit does not merely target the Federal Reserve.

The incident that directly relates to Keenans
lawsuit dates back to 2009, when two Japanese citizens were detained in
Italy, and the bonds they were holding, which totaled $134.5 billion, were
seized.
The two men were Mitsuyoshi Watanabe and
Akihiko
Yamaguchi; the latter being considered Neil Keenans predecessor in acting
as an agent of the Dragon Family.
This incident was reported early on by the mainstream media, even making its
way up to Glenn Becks television show shortly after it occurred. However,
the story quickly disappeared from the mainstream and has not reported on
since.
Here are some mainstream reports on the incident
which are still available online.
Even the alternative media has been largely
silent on the story, with the exception of
Benjamin Fulford, who has been
releasing information related to the lawsuit in question and the surrounding
events for some time.
Whats interesting about the Beck coverage, though, is how the level of
money being discussed here is put into perspective.
During his interview
with Joe Wiesenthal, the editor of BusinessInsider.com, Beck put up a list
of public, unclassified numbers of the amount of the U.S. bonds held by
other countries.
The list was as follows:
Keep in mind, the amount of money seized from
the two Japanese men, was $134.5 billion worth of bonds.
Compare this amount to the list above and one
can see just how huge an amount of money is being discussed. The amount
found in the possession of these two men is so large that, if all the bonds
had come from Russia, it would only have $2.5 billion of U.S. bonds left.
Wiesenthal and Beck both commented on how large an amount of money this is -
not just in monetary terms, but also in the ability to produce it. Even if
it were a forgery, the capabilities to create such a large-scale replica
would require technology most likely held by governments, not rogue
counterfeiters.
As Wiesenthal noted,
it would be the kind of technology you
would expect only a government to have.
At this point, we come to Yamaguchi, one of the
men arrested with the U.S. Bonds, who is described in the lawsuit as
Keenans predecessor and an agent of the Dragon Family.
The two allegedly met as a result of the
assistance provided by Keenan to Yamaguchi in finding a Cyprus bank for some
of the financial instruments used by the Dragon Family. Keenan claims he was
granted special power of attorney to act on behalf of the Dragon Family to
place some of their assets in PPPs (Private Placement Investment Programs).
This is where the story takes yet another bizarre turn.
Keenan claims that after he took possession of the instruments at the heart
of this lawsuit and, a month after the two Japanese men were detained, a man
named
Leo Zagami arrived on the scene.
According to the complaint, Zagami,
a self-described 33rd Degree Freemason,
who, as of April 2008, had reportedly claimed to be the leader of the
breakaway faction of the Knights of Templar and high-level Freemasons
centered around the elite of the Masons P2 (propaganda Due) Lodge in
Monte Carlo.
Zagami also claimed to be a representative of
the Vatican Illuminati and other European secret societies. He also claimed
that he was trying to make contact with certain Asian Secret Societies.
During meetings with individuals only described as contacts, it is claimed
that Zagami told one of these contacts that the two Japanese men, Yamaguchi
and Watanabe, had been set up and that he had inside information about the
instruments that were seized.
Eventually, the mutual contact was introduced to Daniele Dal Bosco,
a
Vatican banker and associate of the P2 Masonic Lodge, as well as fellow
defendant in Keenans lawsuit, whom Keenan was told,
would be able to cash the bonds seized by
the Italian Treasury Police.
Keenan claims that he was in constant contact
with Dal Bosco via Internet Skype and had agreed to meet in Italy.
It is also claimed by Keenan that during the
course of these conversations,
Dal Bosco represented that he was not only
financial advisor to Zagami, but also to the Vatican, Vatican City,
Rome, and the Treasurer to the P2 Masonic Lodge.
Over time, Keenan claims, he came to trust Dal
Bosco and turned the bonds over to him for temporary safekeeping and
custodianship.
After the bonds were in Dal Boscos possession, the lawsuit alleges that Dal
Bosco made off with them and attempted to sell them,
in the global marketplace through stealth,
conversion and bribery.
Keenan also claims that as all of these events
were unfolding, he was routinely offered bribes by high-level officials of
$100 million to release the financial instruments without disclosing to
the Dragon Family where they had gone.
The plan was to allow the instruments to be
converted to a UN Sovereign Program which would be entirely,
under the auspices, protection and umbrella
of the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the defendants.
On a side note, it should be mentioned that
within
the 111-page document, Keenan makes an
astounding claim, and one that should not be ignored if, for no other
reason, because it is so large an amount of money with almost incalculable
repercussions for the United States and its private central banking system.
The document states:
During the course of its existence over the
last century, the Dragon Family has accumulated great wealth by having
provided the Federal Reserve Bank and the United States Government with
asset assignments of gold and silver via certain accounts held in
Switzerland, for which it has received consideration in the form of a
variety of Notes, Bonds, Certificates such as those described in Â¶ 2
that are an obligation of the Federal Reserve System.
Upon information and belief, these bonds
have values ranging in the many Thousands of Trillions of United States
Dollars, a relatively small portion of which is involved in the claims
giving rise to this action.
Each of these currencies, such as the DFFI
(Dragon Family Financial Instrument) involved in this action, was and
remains duly registered within the Federal Reserve System and are
directly verifiable by the Federal Reserve through its efficient
verification system and screening process.
Thousands of trillions is quite the sum of
money.
Although the amount of financial claims in this
lawsuit is not anywhere close to the amount specified above, the fact that
any individual, family, or institution would retain this large sum of money
in U.S. Dollars is alarming, especially to the system which might be liable
to pay it back.
If the amount of money listed is, as the lawsuit claims, easily verified
through the Federal Reserves verification system, the revelation would be
perhaps the biggest bombshell in the history of the Federal Reserve. Perhaps
even in the history of private central banking itself.
Although the claims made by Keenan in this lawsuit can only be looked at as
accusations at this point, one must wonder what the outcome of the case will
be, even if it is unsuccessful in financial terms.
One also wonders whether
or not, if the trial is allowed to move forward, if this lawsuit will
function much as the Jim Garrison JFK trial functioned many years ago. That
is, a failure to procure a conviction or legal victory, but a clear
documentation of the inconsistencies and official stories handed down to the
public from on high.
Perhaps, if Keenans case and facts are in order, this trial will, at the
very least, provide citizens all over the world a view through the window of
the shadowy organizations of Freemasonry, banking, and government.
At this time, Keenan is seeking,
the return of the stolen instruments,
punitive damages and court costs on multiple claims of fraud, breach of
contract and violation of international law.
Keenan is being represented by William H.
Mulligan Jr. with Bleakley, Platt & Schmidt of White Plains, New York.
Bizarre Claim for $1 Trillion
by Dan McCue

MANHATTAN (CN)
An American expatriate in Bulgaria claims,
...conspired with a host of others to steal more
than $1.1 trillion in financial instruments intended to support humanitarian
purposes.
The 111-page federal complaint involves a range
of entities common to conspiracy theorists, including,
Plaintiff Neil Keenan claims he was
entrusted in 2009 with the financial instruments, which included,
-
U.S. Federal Reserve notes worth $124.5
billion
-
two Japanese government bonds with a
combined face value of $19 billion
-
one U.S. "Kennedy" bond with a face
value of $1 billion,
...by an entity called the Dragon Family, which
is a group of several wealthy and secretive Asian families.
"The Dragon family abstains from public view
and knowledge, but, upon information and belief, acts for the good and
better benefit of the world in constant coordination with higher levels
of global financial organizations, in particular, the Federal Reserve
System," Keenan claims.
"During the course of its existence over the last century, the Dragon
family has accumulated great wealth by having provided the Federal
Reserve Bank and the United States Government with asset assignments of
gold and silver via certain accounts held in Switzerland, for which it
has received consideration in the form of a variety of Notes, Bonds and
Certificates such as those described... that are an obligation of the
Federal Reserve System."
Keenan says that with accrued interest the
instruments are now worth more than $1 trillion.
He says the family designated him as its
principal in an effort to select certain registered and authorized
Private Placement Investment Programs (PPPs) for the benefit of
unspecified global humanitarian efforts.
In his remarkable complaint, Keenan claims that the U.S. government enormous
amounts of money - delivered in gold and other precious metals - from the
Dragon Family many years ago, and that the money was placed into
the Federal
Reserve System for the benefit and underwriting support of the dollar,
"which was to become and currently remains
the global reserve currency".
Keenan claims the conspiracy began with the
illegal detention of two Japanese citizens, Akihiko Yamaguchi and Mitsuyoshi
Watanabe, and the seizure of $134.5 billion in bonds they were holding in
Italy, in June 2009.
Yamaguchi can best be described as Keenan's predecessor in trying to place
Dragon Family instruments in legitimate PPPs to advance the group's
humanitarian aims, according to the complaint.
Keenan says he came to know both Yamaguchi and the Dragon Family through the
Japanese man's efforts on the group's behalf, and that he introduced them to
a bank in Cyprus with which they could do business.
Keenan says that in gratitude, Yamaguchi sought and was granted approval to
execute a special power of attorney, whereby Keenan would also act on behalf
of the Dragon Family to place their assets in PPPs.
It was then, he says, that he took possession of the instruments that are
the heart of the lawsuit. For his assistance, Keenan says, he was to receive
a profit share amounting to 30 percent of any particular PPP he arranged.
A month after the Japanese men were detained, an man named
Leo Zagami,
"a self-described 33rd degree Free Mason,
who, as of April 2008, had reportedly claimed to be the leader of a
breakaway faction of the Knights of Templar and high-level Freemasons
centered around the elite of the Masons P2 (propaganda Due) Lodge in
Monte Carlo," arrived on the scene, according to the complaint.
Zagami claimed to be a representative of the
Vatican Illuminati and other European sect societies and,
"had been looking to make contact with
certain Asian Secret Societies," the complaint states.
During a meeting in Japan, he says, he told a
contact that Yamaguchi and Watanabe had been "set up" and that he had inside
information about the seized instruments.
Subsequently, he introduced his contact in Japan to defendant
Daniele Dal Bosco, a
Vatican banker and associate of the P2 Masonic Lodge, who,
"would be able to 'cash the bonds seized by
the Italian Treasury Police,'" according to the complaint.
The complaint alleges a complicated history with
many moving parts and scores of internationally known and unknown
characters, the sum of which is that Keenan claims he was entrusted with
billions of dollars in bonds by the Dragon Family.
He claims that soon, he and Dal Bosco were in daily contact via Skype and
they arranged to meet in Italy. During these conversations, Dal Bosco
represented that he was not only financial advisor to Zagami, but also to
the Vatican, Vatican City, Rome, and the treasurer for the P2 Masonic Lodge.
As a result, Keenan said, although he tried keep personal possession of the
financial instruments with which he was entrusted, he nevertheless came to
trust Dal Bosco, and turned the bonds over to him for "temporary safekeeping
and custodianship".
Dal Bosco absconded with the bonds and sought assistance in selling the
instruments "in the global marketplace through stealth, conversion and
bribery," Keenan claims.
He claims that as the conspiracy continued to unfold, various high level
officials repeatedly offered him a bribe of $100 million to "release" the
instruments without disclosing their theft to the Dragon family, and to
allow the instruments to be converted to a so-called UN "Sovereign Program"
wholly under the auspices, protection and umbrella of the sovereign immunity
enjoyed by the defendants.
Other defendants include,
-
UN General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon
-
Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi
-
Giancarlo Bruno, who is identified as
head of the banking industry for the World Economic Forum
-
Italy's ambassador to the UN Cesare
Maria Ragaflini
-
Ray C. Dam, president of the Office of
International Treasury Control
-
David A. Sale, the deputy chief of the
council for the cabinet of the OITC
Keenan seeks the return of the stolen
instruments, punitive damages and court costs on multiple claims of fraud,
breach of contract and violation of international law.
He is represented by William H. Mulligan Jr., with Bleakley, Platt
& Schmidt of White Plains, N.Y.
