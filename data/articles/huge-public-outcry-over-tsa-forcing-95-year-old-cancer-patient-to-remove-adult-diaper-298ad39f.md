Adult Diaper

The TSA has once again shown itself to be an
agency utterly lacking in respect for human dignity by
forcing a 95-year-old cancer patient to
remove her adult diaper during the screening procedure.
Jean Weber, a leukemia patient, underwent
the humiliating procedure at the Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport where TSA
agents, as usual, claim to be,
"protecting the public from terrorism."
(You have to question the intelligence,
obviously, of any federal employee who believes that terrorists are
hiding weapons inside the diaper of a 95-year-old cancer patient. More
on that below...)
Outrage over the "adult diaper pat-down" has
rapidly spread across the internet as more and more people are waking up and
realizing
the TSA has no concept of human dignity and
can justify anything - yes, anything - as part of the "war
on terror."
The TSA even justified this adult diaper
pat-down, claiming what they did was conducted in a "respectful and
sensitive manner."
Is respectful and
sensitive raping next?
That's the same phrase they're going to use when they start conducting even
more invasive body cavity searches on American travelers.
It's no stretch to imagine the TSA soon
explaining,
"We reached into the anus of those 43
passengers to look for explosives in a respectful and sensitive manner."
Or better yet,
"We raped those teenagers by fondling their
genitals and exploring their body cavities in a respectful and sensitive
manner."
Adding the words "in a respectful and
sensitive manner" to the crimes they are committing does not magically
nullify the crimes themselves.
TSA agents are criminal perverts, molesters and
rapists who combine an over-inflated sense of their own importance with a
stunningly sick lack of respect and dignity for fellow human beings.
They're also ridiculously ineffective at actually increasing the security of
air travel:
While they're busy checking infant diapers for poop bombs and
adult diapers for terrorist weapons, they routinely miss handguns and other
items that are blatantly thrown in carry-on bags and carried right onto
airplanes.

TSA Forces 95 Year Old Woman to Remove Adult Diaper -
Feel Safer Yet?

Singling out the
elderly for extensive pat-downs
To give you a glimpse into the world of idiotic logic used by the TSA to
justify its pathetic existence, this adult diaper pat-down was explained
by Sari Koshetz, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Security
Administration in Miami, who said,
"During any part of the process, if there is
an alarm, then we have to resolve that alarm."
Wheelchairs, it turns out, always trigger an
alarm.
So the TSA spends an inordinate amount of time
checking the underwear of all the people who can't walk. It doesn't take a
genius to figure out that 95-year-old people who can't walk are probably not
likely to carry out terrorist attacks on airplanes. But this concept is
apparently too advanced for the TSA geniuses who have mastered the art of
stripping common sense out of every rule and regulation they're
given.
But here's the most asinine part of this whole event:
After the TSA took off her diaper, they
complained that it was "soiled" and was impeding their search. ("How can
we find bombs with all this crap in the way?") They then requested the
diaper be changed to a new, unsoiled diaper, but the traveling family
did not have a spare diaper available.
What? No diaper? That's probably because they
didn't expect their own government to treat their 95-year-old grandma like a
terrorist and remove her only diaper!
Perhaps the TSA should issue new guidelines to travelers so they'll be
better prepared:
-
Bring a spare set of diapers in case we
make you change them.
-
Bring a spare set of underwear in case
we accidentally rip your existing set as we remove it.
-
Leave your dignity at home. You won't be
needing it anymore.
TSA says it did no
wrong!
TSA spokesperson Sari Koshetz, meanwhile, explained the fascinating
reasoning behind all this by babbling like an idiot robot:
"TSA cannot exempt any group from screening
because we know from intelligence that there are terrorists out there
that would then exploit that vulnerability."
In other words, TSA agents are too stupid
to assess the risk of terrorism by looking at people (or talking to them,
like Israeli security forces do), and they are equally terrified by
everyone.
Imagine moving through the world with this level
of mental retardation - TSA agents who walk down the street on a dark night
are just as terrified of a 95-year-old woman in a wheelchair as they are by
a young gang banger wearing gang clothes and carrying a large knife.
The TSA seems to have lost the ability to distinguish between high security
threats and low security threats... and these are the people running airport
security!
Any terrorist that actually tries to get on an
airplane with explosives must be amused by the fact that all the TSA agents
are busy checking the diapers of senior citizens for poop bombs and are
therefore too distracted to deal with real terrorism threats.
TSA employees need new
work as diaper changers
While TSA employees absolutely suck at security, they do seem to be
particularly well-skilled at changing the diapers of incontinent senior
citizens.
This brings up a new job opportunity for them,
actually:
Fire the TSA and offer their ex-workers new
jobs changing diapers at nursing homes and assisted living centers. It
would be far more helpful to society and might actually teach these
people something about caring for fellow human beings.
It's time for America to stand up against the
undignified and truly outrageous treatment of our veterans, grandmothers,
and even infant babies at the hands of utterly idiotic TSA agents who
claim to be "merely following orders."
That was the excuse of every Nazi Germany
soldier, of course, who committed atrocities against humankind. Any idiot
can "just follow orders."
What we need is some intelligent people who will
refuse those orders if they violate basic human rights (not to mention
Constitutional law).
TSA agents are
reincarnated Nazi soldiers who merely follow orders
What the TSA's behavior really proves is that some human beings will do
ANYTHING if their government hires them to do it.
TSA agents would shoot Jews if they were so
ordered. They would sexually molest babies if that was a TSA rule. They
would arrest and torture travelers using high-voltage electricity if that
was required in the TSA manual. (The
Milgram experiments readily proved this, by
the way.)
There is nothing these TSA agents won't do in the name of "security." And
that's what makes them such an Orwellian nightmare.
These are not people, they are animals because
they lack the basic prerequisites of humanity: Compassion for fellow human
beings, empathy and a recognition of basic human dignity.
But they're perfect for government jobs, of
course, because government doesn't care about human dignity either!
I've warned you many times here on NaturalNews about the TSA and its rise to
Nazi-like power. This is the agency that's becoming the new secret police in
Amerika. If we do not stop this insanity right now, this agency will treat
us all like their own private sex slaves, all while justifying it under some
idiotic security regulation.
Remember:
These events prove that TSA agents will do
anything they are ordered to do. If so ordered, they would round people
up and send them off to gas chambers. They would put a bullet in your
head if there were a TSA regulation requiring such an act. They would
kidnap and torment fellow human beings merely out of some sort of
twisted, sadistic pleasure they get from exerting power over others.
If you ever wondered how Nazi soldiers could
have committed such heinous crimes against humanity in the 1930's and 40's,
look no further than the TSA! You are witnessing Nazi soldiers
reincarnated as American government employees.
The TSA is hiring, by the way. You get full government benefits for as long
as the U.S. federal government still exists and the dollar has any value.
You also get to fondle people's junk and assert your false authority over
innocent travelers.
That's a huge turn-on to the class of thuggish
perverts who now heavily populate the ranks of the TSA.
TSA Pats Down...
Cancer-Stricken 95-Year-Old Woman
...and
Removes Adult Diaper

TSA security officers at Florida's Destin-Fort
Walton Beach Airport patted down a cancer-stricken, 95-year-old woman and
forcibly removed her adult diaper during the search,
CNN reports.
Could this end up being yet another TSA PR
nightmare?
Jean Weber was traveling with her ill mother on June 18 from Florida
to Michigan to see relatives "in the final stages of her battle with
leukemia" when the incident occurred.
Weber told CNN that while she thinks the officers may have been
"procedurally correct... the procedure needs to be changed." Weber noted
that her mother had had a blood transfusion the week before.
Jean Weber says TSA officials
forced her 95-year-old
mother, pictured here, to remove her adult diaper.

A Suspiciously "Wet and Firm"
Diaper
While passing through security, TSA officials,
"felt something suspicious and they couldn't
determine what it was,"
...so they took Weber's mother to a private
room.
A TSA agent told Weber that her mother's Depends underwear was "wet and firm
and they couldn't check it thoroughly," so the mother-daughter duo left in
search of a bathroom to remove the underwear. Weber did not have an extra
pair of Depends with her.
Weber "burst into tears" but her mother was "very calm" even though she was
forced to go through the airport without underwear.
Her elderly mother was taken to the boarding
gate without her as Weber was still going through security.
TSA Defends Search
In response to the incident, the TSA said on Sunday that,
"While every person and item must be
screened before entering the secure boarding area, TSA works with
passengers to resolve security alarms in a respectful and sensitive
manner.
We have reviewed the circumstances involving this screening and
determined that our officers acted professionally and according to
proper procedure."
UPDATE 6/27
The TSA released a follow-up statement on
Monday,
MSNBC reports. The new statement is just a
slight alteration from its original statement.
The TSA's latest statement reads:
"While every person and item must be
screened before entering the secure boarding area, TSA works with
passengers to resolve security alarms in a respectful and sensitive
manner," the statement read.
"We have reviewed the circumstances
involving this screening and determined that our officers acted
professionally, according to proper procedure and did not require this
passenger to remove an adult diaper."
This isn't the first time the TSA has gotten
into hot water over pat down procedures. In April, a video of a
6-year-old
getting a pat down at the New Orleans airport went viral, while in May, a
video of
a baby getting a pat down caused quite a stir.
Last week, the TSA announced they would change the procedures for patting
down children.
