Two-thirds of the world's internet
users live under regimes of government censorship, according to
a report released today.
The report from Freedom
House, a pro-democracy think tank, finds that internet
freedom across the globe declined for a sixth consecutive year
in 2016, as governments cracked down on social media services
and messaging apps.
The findings are based on an
analysis of web freedom in 65 countries, covering 88 percent of
the world's online population. Freedom House ranked China as the
worst abuser of internet freedom for the second consecutive
year, followed by Syria and Iran. (The report does not include
North Korea.)
Online freedom in the US increased
slightly over the year due to the USA
Freedom Act, which limits the bulk collection of metadata
carried out by the National Security Agency (NSA) and other
intelligence agencies.
"An especially
harmful impact
on human rights defenders, journalists,
and
marginalized communities".
This year saw a notable crackdown on
secure messaging apps such as
WhatsApp and
Telegram.
WhatsApp was blocked or restricted
in 12 countries over the course of the year - more than any
other messaging app - including in,
-
Bahrain
-
Bangladesh
-
Ethiopia,
...where authorities blocked it in response to civilian
protests.
Telegram faced restrictions in four countries
including China, where the government
blocked
the encrypted messaging service due to its rising popularity
among human rights lawyers.
"Although the blocking of these
tools affects everyone, it has an especially harmful impact on
human rights defenders, journalists, and marginalized
communities who often depend on these apps to bypass government
surveillance," Sanja Kelly, director and co-author of the
Freedom on the Net 2016 report, said in a statement Monday.
According to Freedom House, 24
governments blocked or restricted access to social media sites
and communication services in 2016, compared with 15 last
year.
Internet freedom declined in 34 of
the 65 countries included in the report, most significantly in,
-
Uganda
-
Bangladesh
-
Cambodia
-
Ecuador
-
Libya
Both Brazil and Turkey had their
rating downgraded to "partly free" and "not free," respectively,
following high-profile web crackdowns in each country.
Governments also blocked more
diverse online content over the past year, as evidenced by an
increase in censorship of online petitions, calls for protests,
and material related to LGBT rights.
Images were more frequently targeted
as well, including photos that mocked authoritarian leaders.
In Egypt, a 22-year-old law student
was sentenced
to three years in prison for posting a photoshopped image of
President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi with Mickey Mouse ears.
A man in Turkey was later sentenced
to a one-year suspended prison term for an image he created
comparing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Gollum, from
Lord of the Rings.
"When faced with humorous memes
and cartoons of themselves, some world leaders are
thin-skinned and lash out," Kelly said in a statement.
"Instead of enjoying a good laugh, they try to remove the
images and imprison anyone posting them online."
Freedom House will officially
announce its latest Freedom on the Net report at an event
at Google's Washington, DC headquarters later Monday.
