Reading from a prepared statement, Patrick
Kennedy, Under Secretary of State for Management, told the
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that criticism of the
U.S.
governments response to U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens death and the
attack in Benghazi was the fault of the Obama administration.
The mainstream media is
calling the attack a,
mission in Benghazi would have overpowered
even a reinforced security detail.
Official Eric A. Nordstrom, regional security
officer who served in Libya for 6 weeks from September 2011 to July 2012,
said to the Committee that,
the ferocity and intensity of the attack
was nothing that we had seen in Libya, or that I had seen in my time in
the Diplomatic Security Service.
Nordstrom asserts that Benghazi security was
weak and there was an increased concern. In fact, when Stevens requested
that the State Department provide more security for him in Libya, he was
denied.
Since
Hillary Clinton,
U.S. Secretary of State, is
ultimately responsible for providing diplomatic security, she would have had
to refuse that request.
Hundreds of millions of dollars were cut from
U.S.
Embassy security over recent years, which was a perfect reason Clinton could
claim as to why Stevens could not have the security needed to protect him in
Benghazi.
Kennedy
said:
The Department of State regularly assesses risk and allocation of
resources for security; a process which involves the considered judgments of
experienced professionals on the ground and in Washington, using the best
information available.
The assault that occurred on the evening of September
11, however, was an unprecedented attack by dozens of heavily armed men.
An immediate cover-up over the attack in
Benghazi commenced as news about the death of Stevens, Sean Smith and 2 U.S.
Marines occurred at the hands of insurgents.
The U.S. State Department
leased gated-villa in Benghazi where Stevens was murdered was owned by
Mohammad al-Bishari.
This is one of the facts about the event that were not
discussed at the Committee hearing.
The state-sponsored 14 minute trailer was
brought to the attention of the Committee as the reason behind the attack in
Benghazi, according to an anonymous member of the intelligence community.
Sam Bacile, a.k.a. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, was an FBI informant and
alleged director/writer/producer of the anti-Muslim film.
Bacile, an Israeli
citizen turned
patsy for the U.S. government participated in the manufacturing of a
trailer that has been used to facilitate instigated tension in the Islamic
world.
At first,
information coming through on cables lacked a reference to the wag the
dog anti-Muslim trailer which Obama asserts was the reason for the attack.
The official stance of the State Department
was:
That is a question that you would have to ask others. That was not
our conclusion.
Also curious is that the U.S. government was
subcontracting Libyan militias for security to be used in protecting
ambassadors like Stevens on missions.
Some of these militia members are
directly tied to Salafis,
Muslim Brotherhood and other terrorist factions
covertly used by the U.S.
government in times of manufactured decent or in the implementation of a
false flag - as is being evidenced in Benghazi as facts are analyzed.
Kennedy continued:
We have always made clear
that we are giving the best information we have at the time. And that
information has evolved.
The information she had at that point from the
intelligence community is the same that I had at that point. As time went
on, additional information became available.
Clinton and the member of the current
administration ultimately responsible for the attack in Benghazi, has
appointed an Accountability Review Board that includes former Joint Chiefs
Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen to assess the security systems and procedures
in current implementation.
Kennedy claims that without the conclusion of
this investigation there is an,
incomplete picture, and, as a result, our
answers today will also be incomplete.
John Brennan, Obamas
Assassination Czar and chief counterterrorism adviser has held a
talk with Mohamed Magariaf, Libyan President and other officials in
Tripoli, where the actual U.S. Embassy is located.
Brennan strongly suggested Magariaf comply with
U.S. pressure for,
assistance from the U.S. and other
countries to combat terrorism.
The cover-up in Benghazi was politically
motivated.
Susan Rice, U.S. Ambassador to
the United
Nations stated just days after the
attack that this was the work of a small group of extremists. Kennedy
pointed out that Rices information was based on sketchy intelligence.
Rice
and the Obama administration have been purveying this false information,
intimated Kennedy to the House Committee.
According to a CIA memo the demonstrations that
sprung up subsequent to the attack,
were spontaneously inspired by protests
at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.
The next logical step, as the CIA explains,
was that extremists stormed the compound to assault Stevens and the other
people inside.
In reality, Stevens was
working with the CIA in monitoring operations in Libya where known
terrorist groups aligned with the U.S. covertly were being watched and
intelligence gathered for future use.
Stevens, who was also a special
representative for the
National
Transitional Council (NTC), the U.S.-supported terrorist faction in Libya,
was also secretly collecting information on them to be used in conjunction
CIA intelligence and possibly to blackmail the faction into submission to
defending U.S. interests.
Stevens was
involved in arms deals with the NTC who supports the Salafi extremist
movement in Saudi Arabia as well as selling weaponry to
the Muslim
Brotherhood.
Ironically, these factions sent their men to murder Stevens at
the gated-villa in Benghazi after Clinton reduced security and told the
Libyan forces to stand down.
Since this attack, Clinton has been working hard to cover her tracks and
involvement in creating the perfect scenario that would facilitate the
attack which occurred.
The State Department initially said that cryptic
warnings of an impending attack on Benghazi was relayed, yet devoid of a
time frame and therefore ignored.
In response to Darrell Issa, chairman of the
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Clinton
asked for more time before speaking to the Committee about her
involvement in Benghazi.
Clinton suggested that Issas investigation be held
off until after the November presidential elections or even pushed back into
the early part of 2013 because witnesses were being questioned at the State
Departments Office of Legislative Affairs.
However, since Clinton could not stave-off the
Congressional Committee, Kennedy was sent to read from a pre-written
statement.
