-
Statement of Purpose - CODOH was founded to encourage
intellectual freedom with respect to the Holocaust.
-
The
Case for Open Debate - No subject enrages campus Thought Police
more than Holocaust Revisionism
-
The 'Problem of the Gas
Chambers' - No one, not even those individuals who regard the
Third Reich with nostalgia, denies the existence of concentration
camps under Hitler
-
Auschwitz myths and facts - Nearly everyone has heard of
Auschwitz, the German wartime concentration camp where many
prisoners -- most of them Jewish -- were reportedly exterminated,
especially in gas chambers
-
Let's
examine the Holocaust from all sides - Nearly everyone has heard
that the Germans killed some six million Jews in Europe during the
Second World War
-
The Liberation of the Camps - Nothing
has been more effective in establishing the authenticity of the
Holocaust story in the minds of Americans than the terrible scenes
US troops discovered when they entered German concentration camps at
the close of World War II
-
What is 'Holocaust Denial'? - In recent
years, more and more attention has been devoted to the supposed
danger of "Holocaust denial"
-
Inside the Auschwitz 'Gas Chambers'
-
1988 was a very informative and likewise disturbing year. I was
appalled to learn that much of what I was taught in school about
twentieth-century history and World War II was a myth, if not a lie
-
The 'Jewish soap' Myth - One of the most
lurid and slanderous Holocaust claims is the story that the Germans
manufactured soap from the bodies of their victims
-
The US Holocaust Memorial Museum - Hard
by the Washington Monument, within clear view of the Jefferson
Memorial, an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln
Memorial, has arisen, on some of the most hallowed territory of the
United States of America, a costly and dangerous mistake
-
Simon Wiesenthal: Bogus Nazi Hunter -
For more than 40 years, Simon Wiesenthal has been tracking hundreds
of "Nazi criminals" from his "Jewish Documentation Center" in Vienna
-
A Prominent False Witness: Elie Wiesel - Elie Wiesel won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. He is generally
accepted as a witness to the Jewish "Holocaust," and, more
specifically, as a witness to the legendary Nazi extermination gas
chambers
-
Why Holocaust Revisionism? - The
"Holocaust," the alleged murder of some six million Jews by the
German Nazis during the Second World War, has in recent years come
under increasing fire from the Revisionists, those unconventional
historians who challenge orthodox versions of past events.
