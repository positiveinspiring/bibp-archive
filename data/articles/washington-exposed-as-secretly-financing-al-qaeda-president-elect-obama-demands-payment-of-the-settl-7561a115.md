PREFACE TO THIS REPORT
In the following report, we have concentrated on intelligence and
interpretations based on our own research and which we can vouch for, and
have largely ignored the cacophony of conflicting, angry, Black and other
propaganda that has swirled around the Internet since Barack Obama became
the President-Elect of the United States.
Our reasoning here can be summarized as follows:
-
Whatever anyone says or believes, a
decisive DISCONTINUITY has finally materialized. A discontinuity
presupposes that all previous assumptions and relationships are
either in flux, changing, or subject to change brought about by a
rearrangement of the correlation of forces.
-
In the above context, the central fact
of importance is that the United States, and therefore the Rest of
the World, have finally climbed out of the frying pan.
-
Specifically, the United States and the
Rest of the World are therefore hovering in mid-air. It is premature
to be certain that we will all proceed to jump into the fire,
because we are as yet still suspended in mid-air between the frying
pan and the fire.
-
Equipped with this mindset, we must add
that, for the purposes of this report ONLY, we are accordingly
AGNOSTIC with reference to the swirling Black propaganda against
Obama, the Clintons and everyone else on the miserable American
political scene which is (see below) manipulated by the controlling
Intelligence Power. Of course we have strong views on all the issues
that have been and continue to be raised in this context: and in
this report we specifically identify, for instance, Mrs Clinton as a
financier of terrorism. But none of these issues have ANY relevance
to the crucial issue that the whole world faces, which is:
-
The absolute paramount necessity for the
completion of the wholesale Settlements payouts and for the
implementation of the G-7-Approved Refinancing Program, which will
refund the US and European (etc) banks and will deliver on-the-books
liquidity throughout the system within a matter of months. The
Settlements payouts will finance the G-7-Approved Refinancing
Program.
-
Belated resistance to the Settlements
(see below) reflects rearguard operations in the face of the reality
that unavoidable repatriation threatens those forced to repatriate,
with latent criminal proceedings and probable jail for having
fraudulent assets on (or under) their books.
In short, we are not concerned, for the purposes
of THIS report, with whether President-Elect Obamas belief that following
Abraham Lincolns technique of placing his enemies at the centre of his
government is well-founded (which it may well be), with who is of course
blackmailing whom (as is known to be the case), with whether a birth
certificate was or was not registered in Timbuktu, with the reappearance of
Clinton retreads on the stage, and with all the other murky side-issues that
have been raised by anxious observers, protagonists, Black propagandists,
controlled agents of influence, and others, since Mr Obama was elected.
And the reason we are not concerned HERE with such issues is that IF THE
SETTLEMENTS ARE NOT FINALIZED, all these people who are shouting at
cross-purposes will eventually fall silent because the United States and
Britain (the Main Enemy) will collapse into a DEPRESSION, on the brink of
which both economies stand as we speak.
Therefore, we do not have the luxury to waste time ventilating about these
innumerable issues, important though some of them certainly are; since if
the Settlements are not completed in short order, the economic and financial
systems will collapse under the weight of nearly $700 trillion sitting on
the roof, which is on the verge of collapsing into the basement.
In other words, its a matter of the proper priorities, and avoiding being
diverted by deliberately contrived redirection and agitation and propaganda
operations which are intended to OBFUSCATE the prevailing situation in
general, and the extremely grave predicament in which ALL the financial
criminals find themselves, in particular.
And right now, there is only one priority, if the whole world is to be saved
in time from absolute catastrophe: completing the Settlement payouts and
breaking all resistance to this process. In the United States and Europe,
forces are moving around, even with guns, to procure the necessary outcome
(intelligence received on Monday 1st December 2008).
This report brings what we have been able to establish on the Settlements
dimension of the world crisis, up to date. We would, however, add that we
found it somewhat distasteful that, after eight years of rightly excoriating
the Bush-Clinton Crime Dynasty and the immense and lasting damage inflicted
on the world under the criminal Bush II-Cheney Administration, guns were
immediately swiveled round and opened fire on the President-Elect.
It would appear that no matter who the Intelligence Power selects (as it
always does) to serve in the White House, they will always receive the same
treatment.
However the source of the US malaise is that the
Intelligence Power, which appoints its agents to the top posts, is in
control, out of control and needs to be brought under control: so until that
happens, nothing fundamental is ever going to change, and the revolutionary
United States will continue sliding into the abyss.
-
WARNING: What follows has been developed
from our own, not secondary, sources. We fully acknowledge that Obama
MAY not measure up to expectations, or worse, and that his Abraham
Lincoln rationalization for appointing Mrs Clinton, subject to approval
by the new Senate, may turn out to be unsound and that what is really
happening is a rearranging of the Titanics deck chairs on the
assumption of corrupt business as usual.
-
But the evidence assembled below suggests
otherwise, if you can temporarily suspend your perfectly reasonable
disgust, which we share, at the appointments of Queen Melusina to the
State Department and Timothy Geithner to the US Treasury.
CIA BRIEFED OBAMA
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING HIS VICTORY
Shortly after John McCain conceded the election, which he appears to have
'thrown' inter alia by selecting the bimbo operative handled by her husband,
Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska, Mr Barack Obama was informed that he would
be briefed at the earliest possible moment by the intelligence community.
This is extremely unusual, if not unprecedented. Mr Obama has been receiving daily
CIA briefings
ever since.
It is understood that the first briefing took place the day after the
election. Since then-Senator Obama had been a junior Senator, he had not
been informed about the financial corruption with which a number of his
fellow Senators were involved up to their necks.
He had been in the Senate for four years, but
for almost two of these years he had often been absent on the campaign
trail.
ILLEGAL INTERFERENCE
BY U.S. AIR FORCE PERSONNEL
Ahead of the election, Barack Obama had been approached by US Air Force
personnel, and asked to step down. It is believed that an attempt to bribe
him to do so was also made. The US Air Force is heavily indoctrinated, while
supporters of the Constitution holding high-level Air Force posts were
removed earlier in 2008, leaving key people in charge who are corrupt and
involved in the financial fraud and thefts.
Interference by armed forces personnel in the
civilian political process (albeit that it is manipulated and controlled by
the Intelligence Power: see below) is strictly prohibited by the Universal
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and of course as a constitutional expert,
Barack Obama immediately told the Air Force representatives to get lost.
He will presumably also have made a note of their identities so that their
illegal behavior catches up with them later.
Following
our report on 31st October that the corrupted former British Prime
Minister Tony Blair had rolled over on all the familiar highest-level
criminalists and their institutional and state co-conspirators, from Bush 41
and 43, the Clintons and
the Pope, to Chancellor Merkel, Deutsche Bank and
elements of the Hungarian Government (always secretly aligned with the
STASI/DVD), it had become imperative to divulge to the new President-elect
what had been going on behind the scenes in the darkness.
We understand that Blairs testimony has now thrown so many grenades into
the blazing furnace that explosions are going off in all directions, causing
the previously asbestos-clad rats to rush around all over the place inside
the furnace trying to escape the heat and flames before they are all
engulfed by them.
This is a late factor that has briefly 'delayed'
resolution of the Settlements. It has had this effect because the Blair
capitulation has CHANGED EVERYTHING for the criminalists, in that their
bluff has been called and THESE RATS cannot now escape.
Especially given Blairs revelations of the relevant sensitive issues, in
which he shopped all the main financial criminals and his fellow
highest-level co-conspirators and accessories to the fact of these immense
crimes, the US intelligence authorities had been left with no choice in the
matter, since they had not been in the driving seat for many months (see
below) and risked very severe consequences should they themselves withhold
crucial information about the corruption, from the President-elect.
The sensible decision was therefore taken to
brief Barack Obama at the earliest opportunity.
We are advised that he received what he was told
with shock and contempt.
OBAMA ALSO SHOCKED TO
FIND THAT BIDEN KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
Of particular concern, we understand, to President-Elect Obama was his
realization that his Vice-Presidential colleague, Mr Biden, knew all about
the financial corruption (let us leave the matter there) and so, by
definition, may have committed an offence under the Misprision of Felony
Statute (1), at the very least, and will, on further investigation, have
been a co-conspirator to some degree or another.
This realization explains why Biden was
subsequently described as being unhappy with the situation in which he now
found himself. Could it be that Biden, to put the worst possible
construction on the matter, may have expected his future boss to succumb to
the bribery pressure that the corrupt incumbent in the White House would be
likely to impose upon him?
The Editors original notes on information received at 8.20pm UK time on 6th
November include a reference to indications that Senator Obama was first
informed to a limited extent that a gigantic scandal with explosive
implications was out of control back in May 2008, but that he was not given
pertinent details at the time.
Our notes state that Mr Obama only started to
find out after he was elected and received private security briefings by CIA
agents. Hes starting to find out how many figures were involved, and hes
saying [expletive deleted]. His meetings started yesterday and continued all
day today. Hes furious and also very angry at Biden. It has never been
known for a President-Elect to receive CIA briefings 'immediately his
election has been confirmed'.
Our sources elaborated that Obamas meeting
with his financial team. He learned this stuff and was horrified'.
Briefing Obama on this occasion must in any case have been a distinctly
painful experience for the compromised General Hayden, Director of
Central Intelligence, and also for John Negroponte, the former
Director of National Intelligence (see below), if he too had to attend
the briefing, since the CIA and its numerous appendages and so-called
subsidiary agencies are notoriously disruptive revolutionary criminal
enterprises that have themselves been fully engaged in spearheading the
fraudulent finance dimension of the World Revolution.
VOLCKER, A TRUSTEE,
HAS SOUND REASONS FOR HIS ADVICE
In this connection, the key member of Obamas financial advisory team, and a
powerful adviser during the later stages of Mr Obamas campaign, is Paul
Volcker, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and a man who,
whatever critics may say, is held in the highest esteem internationally.
As a righteous Jew, this expert is believed to
abhor all the financial corruption, although he IS a Trustee for the
Settlements'.
-
Over 1,000 Trustees were originally
appointed, all of them connected in some way to Bush Sr.
This does not necessarily mean that all Trustees are or will have been
compromised (although Bush Sr. always seeks to double-cross, intimidate
and/or compromise those with whom he has dealings). In the present
context, what it means is that Volcker himself, as a Trustee, needed to
be paid, so that he, too, could fulfill his obligations as a Trustee
towards other parties. That has been a very significant fact in the
overall quadrilateral equation.
-
On 27th November, Reuters reported that Mr
Obama had picked Volcker to head a special office to advise on economic
and financial recovery.
SATELLITE-LINKED TRADING AND
ECONOMIC TERRORISM
One dimension of this pointless activity has typically included the
distribution inside the United States of special satellite-linked grey
screen trading equipment enabling selected operatives to conduct secret
off-balance sheet and therefore illegal 'terrorist' trading from their own
homes, often ostensibly unknown even to their own family members. This
activity has been very severely curtailed or stopped altogether, as all
transactions and funds associated with this trading is tracked 24/7.
Many
operatives engaged in these illegal trades have had to close down their
operations, have gone to ground, or have been arrested.
When tackled about these activities in the past, members of such US
operatives families, who sort of knew what was going on, have typically
tended to fall back on the words national security when asked direct
questions about what such unusual satellite trading equipment was being used
for this phrase being favored as cover for the reality that the trading
equipment had been given to the operatives by the CIA et al. to enable them
to conduct illegal, off-balance sheet, untaxed, secret fraudulent finance
counterparty trading operations undetected, as such transactions are or were
of course all unaudited and subject to no checks and balances at all.
-
By their involvement in such hidden
fraudulent financial trading activity, the secret Agency-linked traders,
located all over the United States, were engaged in economic terrorism
and are accordingly vulnerable, as the purge widens, to being arrested
and indicted for such crimes.
Of course even family members who knew what
their spouses were up to may genuinely have assumed that their secret
trading activities were covered by the National Security Act of 1947 et
seq.; but since most of these people knew perfectly well what was going on,
their toleration of such corrosive activities, amounting to economic
terrorism, which have created such growing havoc by accelerating the rate of
expansion of the overhang of unrealizable outstanding fiat obligations,
represents a prima facie breach of the Misprision of Felony Statute.
DOUBLE-MINDED CRIMINAL
ENTERPRISE SERVES DVDS AGENDA
The CIAs fraudulent finance operations have been systematically destroying
the global financial economy in accordance with the bribery-oriented
blueprint developed by George Bush Sr. and the corrupt Dr Alan Greenspan for
Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst (DVD), Dachau, the heirs of the Nazi Abwehr
originally directed from Oklahoma City by the late Admiral Canaris, who
operated under the assumed name of Samuel Randall Pittman until he fell ill
in 1974, when his place was occupied on a temporary basis by the triple or
quadruple agent Dr Henry Kissinger, who has never managed to discard his
hideously guttural German accent, which no American ever seems to have
questioned!
Kissinger persuaded President Gerald Ford (a.k.a. the pornographer Leslie
Lynch King Jr.) to fire William Colby (later suicided during a canoe
trip on the Potomac) and to replace him as DCI with
George Henry Walker
Bush Sr. (Scherff), a long-time Abwehr/DVD asset and CIA agent implicated in
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, in a maneuver whereby the
DVD came to control the Central Intelligence Agency totally (rather than
partially through the notorious earlier postwar penetrations).
In April 2008, a connected US visitor who
appeared at our London office without an appointment on Good Friday,
volunteered that our DVD analysis is 100% correct.
LONG-RANGE PAN-GERMAN
REVANCHIST STRATEGIC DECEPTION
The pan-German Black DVD Nazi strategic deception Continuum is motivated
by a hatred of the Anglo-Saxons for having supposedly won two World Wars
as a consequence of which Germany was virtually destroyed. In 1941-42, the
Nazis set up a German Geopolitical Centre in Madrid, which became a haven
for Gestapo officers, who occupied all the main hotels there for many years.
In the early 1950s, the Allies intercepted a document that they
labeled the
Madrid Circular Letter which spelled out pan-German long-range plans to
reverse the outcomes of the two World Wars.
This document elaborated on Nazi policy papers captured by the Allies at the
end of the Second Illuminati War, one of which boasted that we shall build
the Thousand-Year Reich on the Ruins of the United States, as explained in
great detail in the Editors book The New Underworld Order.
The Madrid Circular Letter' claimed that für uns ist der Krieg niemals
vorbei (for us, the war never ended).
But the West in general, and the
United States in particular, complacently assumed that, having personalized
the enemy in the format of the hate-figure of Hitler, that operatives
demise represented the end of the Nazi menace. This view was
catastrophically mistaken.
For, as described in the Editors book and widely elaborated elsewhere, the
Nazi repression and intelligence chief in the Soviet Union, General Reinhard
Gehlen, not only managed to persuade a willing US political and intelligence
class that Mr Stalin was preparing to invade Western Europe (whereas in
reality Josef Djiugashivili-Kochba had only one and a half mechanized
divisions, the rest being either decimated or still horse-drawn, while his
repression cadres were bogged down with imposing their control over the
newly-annexed satellites), but also over time procured the mass penetration
of the US intelligence community and other US structures with former Nazi
operatives and scientists, finally backing the reconstituted European
elements of his former networks into the Germany-based US intelligence
structures themselves (CIA-1, Frankfurt).
WORLD NOW ENGULFED IN
A CHAOTIC INTELLIGENCE WAR
All intelligence organizations today are at war within themselves, as all
have been penetrated by foreign powers and domestic enemies, as a
consequence of which no intelligence operative can ever trust any of his or
her colleagues and must live with the knowledge that he or she is liable to
be deceived, double-crossed or entrapped without warning at any stage of a
given operation.
The upshot is that the whole world is now engulfed in a ruthless,
no-holds-barred, long-running and now red-hot intelligence war over money,
which is actually destroying all money and asset values on a scale with no
historical precedent. We did predict this outcome in our reports dated 2nd
September 2006, and in reports posted, for instance, on 18th and 27th July
2007 [see Archive].
As indicated earlier, the intelligence war over money had been raging
largely below the radar, with periodic eruptions, certainly since the Second
World War. But given the terrible intransigence of the organized
intelligence community-linked criminals who hijacked the White House and the
US Treasury under the Bush and Clinton Crime Families, we need hardly be
surprised that many unruly elements of the darkness are taking matters into
their own hands, seeking to ignite flashpoints in the cynical expectation of
being able to foment wars and rumors of wars which can subsequently be
exploited to cover up their financial thefts and fraudulent operations.
For instance, the Bombay atrocities could well
have been associated with the Bush-linked Black forces' fury that the
Indian authorities may have ceased to cooperate over $2.0 trillion that
was illegally transferred, you will recall, to UBS New Delhi, in the course
of 2007, when the criminal financial operations were at their peak, before
our exposures had started to bring the perpetrators to book.
Amazingly, however, these penetrated and internally warring intelligence
communities rely upon the Rule of Law as a back-stop, even though some
of them (headed by the CIA) treat the Rule of Law with absolute contempt
and consider that they have an open-ended license to break the law, the only
rule being you are on youre own if you get caught.
CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE
INCOMPATIBLE WITH GOOD GOVERNANCE
Self-evidently, the existence of criminal enterprise intelligence
communities as evil as the CIA and its subsidiaries is quite incompatible
with good governance and indeed with national and external stability and
wellbeing.
Moreover, as we have explained both
electronically and in several of our publications, the aggressive
Intelligence Power acquires hegemony over the other two sides of the power
triangle, the Military Power and The Party which, in the geomasonic
control model, is split between two main factions (Thesis, Republicans and
the Conservative Party; Antithesis, the US Democrats or the Labour Party).
The Intelligence Power typically develops its
odious status as the immense, arrogant State within the State by
exploiting its power of penetration and its licence to deceive, so that it
places its own operatives inside the Military Power and The Party.
In both
Britain and the United States, the Intelligence Power selects and prepares
candidates for the highest offices from among the ranks of its operatives or
assets giving rise to our aphorisms:
-
The Intelligence Power is in control,
out of control and needs to be brought under control
-
It is neither here nor there which
faction of The Party wins elections, because the Intelligence Power
always wins
In the parallel and almost identical (covert)
Soviet model, exactly the same phenomenon applies.
This central reality (which few Americans yet
seem to grasp) does not detract from the fact that the two wings of The
Party are or can be at almost perpetual loggerheads with each other, and
bitter enemies at all times. After all, enmity, hatred, conflict,
antagonism, lying, deceit, reprobate abuse, paedophilia, double-crossing,
bearing false witness and all the other familiar Black behavior that is
characteristic of the darkness are presupposed, given that Evil Spirit is in
charge here.
Perpetual conflict and tension (which the controlled operatives Trotsky and
Mao Tse-Tung took to the extreme of advocating and promoting 'Permanent
Revolution') are the necessary prerequisites for 'fruitful' manipulation of
the dialectical process (Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis), with successive
dialectical cycles occurring until (in theory) such time as the pre-intended
'Synthesis' is achieved.
But of course, as all this is the work of the Devil, that never actually
happens: hence the use of the word 'Revolution', meaning going round and
round in circles.
The word 'reactionary' was developed as a label to be used against all who
oppose going round and round in circles, with the completely illogical
connotation that those who prefer standing still and not getting dizzy by
going round in circles, are boring stick-in-the muds who can be dismissed as
beyond their sell-by-date.
The use of twisted semantics is an important
revolutionary tool.
TABLES DECISIVELY
TURNED AGAINST PARTS OF THE OCTOPUS
Anyway, we diverge (on purpose), dont we?
Actually, a modicum of scene-setting has been considered necessary, in
particular so as to address two rearguard agitprop campaigns that erupted
the moment John McCain conceded the election, leaving Barack Obama as the
President-elect.
McCain is reported to have decided to throw
the election in part because, finally, he had become sick of the endless
corruption, and preferred the prospect of retiring to a status of 'elder
statesman', not least so that the far-reaching purge that we identified and
predicted in our report dated 6th November 2007, would not be liable to be
focused in his direction. In that report, we published paragraphs headed as
follows:
-
'Why the overdue purge, once started,
will now continue'
-
'The bad apples will continue to be
purged'
-
'The American people will suffer because
they cannot get on top of the most dangerous pack of deceiving and
thieving wolves in the world'
DEFEATED 'GERMAN
FACTION' FURIOUS THAT IT HAS BEEN COMPREHENSIVELY THRASHED
The good news, as will be explained below, is that, at long last, the tables
are now being decisively turned against these ruthless criminal operatives
a fact which has so far escaped the attention of most Americans, and has
certainly not been well understood by many correspondents in the United
States impatient for progress but lacking adequate information, who appear
to imagine that these evils can somehow be remedied overnight, let alone by
various frantic authors of certain hysterical electronic postings which have
their known origins in last-ditch US counterintelligence agitprop operations
separately designed to destabilize the President-elect, and the British.
Both these sewage outflows of disinformation have been driven by the
following realities:
-
THE UNITED STATES IS NOW RANK BUST. It
is IN HOCK to the European powers. This is NOT a result of
deliberate entrapment by these European powers: it is a consequence
of the unfortunate failure of the American people to clean up their
country's mess, which is to say, their failure to find a mechanism
for ridding the political structures of the corrupt organised
criminals who hijacked the US political process many years ago for
illegal and corrupt self-enrichment purposes.
-
No-one in Europe blames the American
people for this failure: it is hardly THEIR fault that such a
ruthless gang of criminals and thieves took over their Government
and turned it into a murderous money-making machine for their own
purposes, to the detriment of the American people and of the whole
world, leaving the United States with a degraded reputation as a
pariah state.
-
After all, the United States 'replaced'
Britain as the leading power in the world, and expects the Rest of
the World to hold its currency, as prescribed under the Bretton
Woods system, which ALSO laid down that the second, offsetting,
world currency shall remain the pound sterling (which is why,
contrary to what the President of the European Commission is now
claiming, Britain is NOT about to dump the pound and substitute the
European Collective Currency, which is backed by nothing, has no
Treasury and lacks any Government in the true sense).
-
Contrary to the bitter propaganda
motivated precisely by the fact that the DVD-linked criminals
holding the highest offices have now been COMPREHENSIVELY DEFEATED,
a nasty rearguard 'Blacking' operation (which no-one other than the
less well-informed (through no fault of their own) takes seriously)
has suggested that the Brits have got the 'upper hand': whereas what
has really happened is that the thefts of The Queen's gold and
attempted thefts of Her Majesty's loan funds, and other financial
crimes against the Sovereign arising from the surreptitious
installment by Bush-Blair of fraudulent finance operations involving
Deutsche Bank and the Vatican Bank run through Coutts Bank as
clearing house, have been 'put in order'.
At the same time, since the financial crimes were committed abroad,
especially in Britain, British law enforcement, intelligence and
justice have been deployed to procure the intended outcome against
the intransigent wishes of the scorched and defeated criminalists
and their some of their intelligence and banking associates, and
latterly now of Gordon Brown [see below].
-
The pan-German Fifth Column headed by
the DVDs Bush Sr. (Scherff) have now been thrashed so badly, and
repeatedly thrashed so badly, that they are bleeding and screaming
and bellyaching as they wallow in the mess resulting from their
newly exposed criminality, alike a spoilt child who has been
disciplined and refuses to submit to any discipline whatsoever.
-
There is nothing (apart from organizing
retaliatory flashpoint atrocities such as shipping trigger-happy
mind-controlled False Flag terrorist cadres by boat into Bombay and
ordering them through compartmentalized cutouts to indulge in a
sadistic bloodbath of Jews and other foreigners) that they can now
do about this massive defeat that they are experiencing.
DIVERSIONARY PURPOSE
OF PANICKY ANTI-BRITISH AGITPROP
The purpose of the crude attacks on the British that we have been seeing of
late is therefore to reverse the truth which is that the criminal
financial operations, equating to financing terrorism, were and have
continued to be recklessly perpetrated by these arrogant US criminal
operatives against The Queen (see below) and Britain generally, as well as
against certain other key European countries.
Those controlled diversion and redirection
outlets that have been pointing the finger at the British have been ordered
or encouraged to do so by their handlers, as part of a crude, belated and
futile rearguard response to the stark and decisive defeat these criminals
have suffered and are facing, to try to obfuscate what has been going on,
and to salvage the wounded pride of those agents of influence who have been
unwilling to comprehend that the criminality originated at home but had to
be exported to Europe and beyond because the relevant financial fraud
operations were and remain illegal under, inter alia, the US securities
laws.
See also, appended at the foot of this report, the list of US Statutes that
the American perpetrators flouted, and for which many of their number,
including representatives of the criminal enterprises, will certainly be
called to account as a consequence of crucial US judicial processes which
remain empanelled and are intensively engaged in comprehensive reviews of
the epidemic of Bush-linked fraudulent finance highlighted by these
exposures.
These processes will impinge upon the Senate
confirmation hearings, which will need to consider the criminal activities
of certain nominees.
Recall that nine aircraft were commandeered, as reported in our posting
dated 6th November 2007, to transport thousands of arrested US bankers to
European centers, especially Britain, where they were taken into custody
under the European anti-terrorism legislation.
As we reported recently, the
bankers and others, including some of their lawyers, were duly jailed for
periods of 25 years, with the aggregate number of such prisoners languishing
in British and European jails now believed to exceed 10,000.
Further information about what they were up to,
is contained in the present report.
BUSH TRIED TO BRIBE
OBAMA WHEN HE VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE
When considering what follows, it will be as well to remind ourselves that
what is presented for public consumption may of course diverge 100% from the
reality.
Hence widely distributed press photographs of President-elect Obama
and his wife flanked by a mean-looking President George W. Bush who has made
a complete mess of his Presidency, and his wife Laura with her stiff false
smile, at the White House on Monday 10th November, were intended to imply
that the outgoing team had been engaged in a polite encounter, smoothing the
way for the President-Elect to assume power and displaying before the
whole world that the United States transfers power without acrimony.
Nothing could have been further from the truth about what happened on Monday
10th November, when Mr and Mrs Obama appeared at the White House on
schedule.
For according to our special sources, what then happened was that Mr Obama was immediately subjected to the Bush bribery routine.
Specifically, heavy pressure was exerted on him to meet the wishes of the
Bush-Cheney criminalist gangsters in exchange for a huge payout, the
proportions of which have not yet been specified (whereas it is known that a
huge volume of gold was paid to a previous contender for high office on an
earlier occasion).
Reflecting his innate strength of character, his standards of belief and
conduct and his extensive knowledge as a former professor of constitutional
law in Chicago, Barack Obama reacted with an outright rejection, along the
lines inter alia of you must be joking whereupon there really wasnt
much more to be said.
The
Bush Crime Family had finally blown
it.
These criminal operatives behaved as they have behaved all along assuming
that the Cheney-favored post-war neo-Nazi-originated power-building
technique of bribery, with its corollary of blackmail and control, would
work, as had been the case in innumerable instances before.
They took the desperate risk that their offer
might be turned down, without stopping to think what the consequences of
such an 'inconceivable' rejection would be likely to be.
BUSH WARNED: DO NOT
TOUCH OBAMA, OR ELSE
In order to register the momentous consequences of this encounter on 10th
November 2008, a concomitant development must be reported here.
Following Obamas election victory, George Bush
Sr. and associates, including his cokehead son, were informed by powerful
but unspecified parties that if they proceeded with their project to have
President-Elect Barack Obama 'removed' an intention that had been
discovered to be a reality, as opposed to wishful thinking all those
concerned would immediately be liquidated without further ado.
-
Now it will be recalled that we have
previously reported that Bush Sr., the Personification of Evil, has
previously been warned that he would be shot dead on sight a
warning he has ignored.
-
In 2004, when confronted by
representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about his open-ended
criminal operations at home and abroad, the charming Mr George Bush
Sr. is reported to have shouted: Go take a flying [expletive
deleted] at the moon. [Verbatim].
But this time, the force of the warning appears
to have penetrated one ear of the relevant skulls without immediately
shooting out of the other one as usually happens, given that there is not
a lot in between.
It was borne in upon these crooks that the
Intelligence Power had long since made up its mind WHO was to be President
of the United States, and that the US Intelligence Power was supported by
the Military Power as well not least, at this late stage, because the
Military Power knows what the consequences in terms of domestic
revolutionary social unrest would be liable to be, should anything happen to
the new President-Elect.
BLAIR SUBJECTED TO
INTENSE INTERROGATION IN THE UNITED STATES
In other words, the temperature immediately following the election could be
described as close to boiling point, especially as the former British Prime
Minister, Tony Blair, had crossed the Atlantic for a second time, to appear
in Washington DC for further questioning.
-
This followed his capitulation two weeks or
so earlier when, faced with a summons to appear, as ordered by Speaker
Michael Martin, before a House of Commons Committee ostensibly called
upon to investigate the 11-year-old matter of Blairs exemption of the
Formula One motor racing sector from a ban on tobacco advertising
shortly after Blair had seen its controller, the dubious Monaco-based
Bernie Ecclestone in 1997, Blair had decided to roll over on all the
primary participants in this fraudulent finance epidemic, as we reported
here on 31st October 2008.
As explained in that report, UK Parliamentary committees will only
address issues that are before the relevant House and concern its
specific business; so the intention had been to entrap Blair with
evidence based inter alia (but not exclusively) upon evidence that
surfaced following the raids on the safety lock boxes by 300 armed
Metropolitan Police masterminded by Assistant Deputy Metropolitan Police
Commissioner John Yates on 2nd June 2008 an absolutely crucial,
decisive development in the process of unraveling the criminal
operations of the Octopus.
BLAIR AND BUSH SET LONDON UP
AS FRAUDULENT FINANCE PLATFORM
-
On Sunday 2nd November, Blair had been
obliged to rush to the United States for the first time since he had
rolled over, inter alia to sign certain key release documents in the
presence, it is believed, of two Supreme Court Black Robes. With such
information surfacing, it now began to emerge that Blair had been much
more deeply involved (see below) with the fraudulent finance operations
than may have previously been understood. For on 3rd November, we were
able to establish from two reliable sources that:
-
Following 9/11 (when a large portfolio of
contracts had perished given that the offices and 652 personnel of
Cantor Fitzgerald, the British-based money brokerage firm, had been
destroyed when the Twin Towers were blown up), and certainly by May 2003
when the Editor of this service started to become aware of this, former
President Bush 41 and Prime Minister Blair had been instrumental in
procuring the exploitation of London as the main platform for a new
wave of fraudulent finance operations inter alia using stolen assets as
base.
The Bank of England provided secret offshore account facilities
for this purpose as well, and has been directly involved in these
activities:
-
hence (a) the arrest of the former Governor, Eddie (Lord)
George, in July 2007
-
and (b) the tension that is evident on the face of
the current Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King
-
Specifically, Coutts Bank, The Queens
bank, was selected to serve as clearing house (money laundry) to move
secret fiat funds through to Deutsche Bank, the DVDs house bank, and
on to the Vatican Bank, by now directed by the former President of the
Bundesbank, Herr Dr Hans Tietmeyer, under the control of the
German Pope Ratzinger. At Coutts, there is or was a lock box containing substantial
usurped collateral assets which may have underpinned at least part of
this operation.
-
Nefarious intentions here included a blatant
attempt to compromise Her Majesty the Queen by exploiting the services
of this institution, Coutts Bank, known to have connections with
Royalty.
-
More generally, cover for this illicit
financial activity was to be provided, crudely put, by The Queen,
unknown to her, and the Pope simultaneously.
-
Incredibly, the conduit enabling aspects
of this criminalist assault to be perpetrated is reported to us to have
been a certain Bernie Ecclestone, whose Formula One (cover?) operations
are based in Monaco which is the CIAs main European money-laundering
centre.
Formula One. which may be a massively lucrative money laundry (serving
the necessary 'project' purpose applicable to all such finance), is
known to have very extensive German dimensions and is ultimately
controlled by Max Mosely, son of Sir Oswald Mosley, head of the British
Fascist Party and a Mussolini symathiser, and the supremely snobby
socialite Diana Mitford, who had been a personal friend of Adolf Hitler-Schickelgrüber
and a Nazi sympathizer (both of whom were interned by the British
Government at the outbreak of the Second Illuminati War).
Hence the significance of Speaker Michael Martins order for Blair to
appear before a House of Commons investigating committee over the 1997 'Ecclestone
affair'.
-
There is also an extraordinary separate
Ecclestone dimension which would appear to have represented an early
attempt by UK authorities to bear false witness against the Editor of
this service in order to discourage him from pursuing these enquiries
(an operation which of course had the opposite effect). This dimension
is elaborated on pages F-03 et seq. of the new issue of International
Currency Review [Volume 34, Number 1], published at the end of November
2008, excerpts from which are posted below in the Appendix.
On 21st November it was extensively publicized that the diminutive (5ft
4ins) Ecclestone is to be divorced by his extremely tall Croatian wife
(and DVD handler?) Slavica, who could be in line for a record-breaking
divorce settlement, as many of his assets are reported to be lodged in
her name. The timing of this development is curious, to say the last.
POWERS OF ATTORNEY TO
INVESTIGATE COUTTS LOCK BOX
In March 2005, the Editor of this service was granted a strictly limited (at
his request) Power of Attorney empowering him to investigate and report on
the existence of certain assets held at Coutts Bank.
The Editor attended the
offices of Attorney Steven Goodwin in Richmond, VA, from where a conference
call to Coutts Bank was arranged at which Mr Goodwin was to inform the bank
that he would be attending at Coutts with the Editor in this connection.
The phone call was initially directed to a Mrs Burgess, a contact previously
established by the Editor; but when put through, it was diverted to a Mr
Robertson, a Scot presumably installed by Royal Bank of Scotland, of which
Coutts, via Natwest Bank, was by now a subsidiary (such hasty banking
mergers facilitate the hiding of irregular transactions).
-
This Mr Robertson did his best to affect
total ignorance of the assets in question. At the end of the said
conference call, the Editor surprised Mr Robertson by interjecting to
say that as Editor of International Currency Review, he was conducting
an extensive investigation into missing and hijacked finances worldwide,
which was one reason why he would be attending at Coutts Bank
accompanied by Mr Goodwin, as had been tentatively arranged for early
April 2005.
On 3rd April [see Figure 23, International
Currency Review, Volume 33, Numbers 3 & 4, page F-124, facsimile], Mr
Goodwin wrote to Robertson at Coutts Bank's central London address, 440
Strand, London WC2R 0QS, demanding information about certain corporate
accounts and noting (by way of illustration) as follows:
Enclosed herewith please find a specific Power of Attorney granting me
access to this [specified] information. I would specifically refer you to an
account in the name of Pacific Victory S.A., having an account number of Z
63 66 76.
It is my understanding that on or about April 26
1999, a significant transfer was made into this account at your bank from
Standard Chartered Bank, and [that] this transaction was handled by bank
officer J. D. Fleming, and/or John S. de C. Firth, Vice-President.
Please contact me immediately regarding
these accounts. I look forward to your prompt response.
CONFERENCE CALL
IGNITED RED LIGHTS EVERYWHERE
In the light of the fact that Coutts Bank had been selected, we now know, as
the clearing house for the illicit transactions referenced above, you can
imagine that the reaction of US and international eavesdroppers to that
conference call will have been, shall we say, one of considerable alarm
especially, one would imagine, at Fort Meade, GCHQ Cheltenham, and at the
DVD's listening post near Munich.
How was it possible that a mere investigative
journalist was so rapidly onto the tail of this newly relaunched fraudulent
finance undercover money-laundering operation sponsored by George Bush Sr.
and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair?
At that stage of the investigations, the Editor had been advised that the
intention was to repatriate all the funds deposited outside the United
States and illegally deployed (both by the institutions and by corrupt US
operatives) as collateral following the takedown of the Soviet Union, with
the collaboration of the bribed Gorbachëv and of the key GRU operative
Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.
But not long after this telephone conference call, a clandestine switch
took place, and the Editor was in due course informed that $4.5 trillion, by
way of a settlement, had been sent over from the Peoples Bank of China in
May 2006 (after the no-longer-dead Howie Kwong Koks signature for the
release had been obtained).
These funds were supposed to have been made
available to finance what is now called the G-7-Approved Refunding Program,
with effect from June 2006: instead of which, the US Treasury
Secretary-designate, Henry M. Paulson, secretly signed a certain contract
alienating the funds on 20th or 21st June 2006.
-
Since this was of course all done behind
closed doors, the Editor was not informed and we embarked, as
requested, upon what became our globally disseminated Wantagate
quest for fulfillment of the delivery, which never materialized.
-
It now appears that we were encouraged
to do precisely this (which was why the Editor was left alone) as
COVER for the switch and diversion of the funds that had already
taken place.
GROSS ERROR OF
JUDGMENT BY U.S. COUNTERINTELLIGENCE
If so, that was a catastrophic mistake on the part of the US intelligence
communitys cack-handed strategists. OK, we were deceived at the time, and
for a long time.
But the deception led directly to the global
crisis that is now unfolding, because in pursuing the whereabouts and
handling of the $4.5 trillion, we unexpectedly exposed successive layers of
US official and banking sector duplicity and corruption, which led in
December 2006 to Paulsons arrest in Germany, and thereafter to the
successive peeling away of the onion of gross deceit and fraudulent finance
which precipitated what became known as the sub-prime crisis a slide
imposed by US counterintelligence on the situation, designed to prevent the
mainstream media from investigating further.
As this catastrophe expanded, we specifically warned that the outcome would
be a train wreck: see, for instance, our reports dated
-
18th July 2007 (Touch and Go)
-
27th July 2008 (Global Train Wreck)
-
10th August 2007 (And so it came to
pass: (Subtitled) Finally, years of financial fraud start
unraveling)
-
30th August 2007 (The sub-prime link:
How Wantagate unraveled the sub-prime scams) [see Archive],
...not to mention innumerable other posted
warnings along the same lines, starting with our earliest prediction of what
would happen in the financial and the real worlds if Paulson, the US
Treasury Secretary, continued with his corrupt practices (2nd September
2006).
In other words, the highest-level perpetrators of these fraudulent financial
maneuvers, headed by the Bush and Clinton Crime Families, Paulson, Cheney,
Greenspan and the rest, PERSISTED with their illegal, unconstitutional
behavior as economic terrorists, in the face of both our warnings of what
their behavior would lead to, and the rapidly accumulating confirmations
that these warnings were soundly based.
Even when that was OBVIOUS to all
who were not sitting on their brains, they CONTINUED WITH THEIR
MANIPULATIONS AND DECEPTION MANEUVERS.
It is thought that during this period, because the mainstream, controlled
and directed by Cheney, remained fast asleep, the US criminalists assumed
complacently that the warnings posted on this website could be safely
ignored.
But what was also ignored was that the Editor of this service is
the longest-serving editor of economic and financial publications in the
world.
BLAIR INFLUENCED BY
THE GERMAN MOLE ROY JENKINS
A relevant word here about Tony Blairs political pedigree. Blair, an
intelligence officer, was a protégé of Roy Jenkins, one of the Oxford
undergraduates who, with Edward Heath and Geoffrey Rippon (the joint
signatories of the illegal British Treaty of Accession to the European
Economic Community in 1972) had been recruited decades earlier by pan-German
interests, as exposed in the first report to have been posted on this
website (dated 12th October 2005).
Heath, in fact, was the longest-serving mole ever to have been exposed
(which occurred, by the way, in 2003). Hence Blairs geopolitical
orientation was influenced by Heaths fellow traitor Roy Jenkins.
Blair was responsible for appointing John
Scarlett as head of MI6; and as also reported here, John Scarlett serves the
interests of the pan-German agenda (i.e., the Abwehr/DVD), which initiated
and controls the European Union Collective, an anti-nation state entrapment
instrument, the purpose of which is to defang, collectivize, enronise and
also entrap its constituent Member States, in accordance with the blueprint
specified in the Nazis 1941 compendium Europäische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft
(European Economic Community), published by Haude & Spenersche
Verlagsbuchhandlung Max Pashke in Berlin in 1943, copies of which may be
inspected in the Staatsbibliothek, Berlin, and in the British Library (on
request).
-
As previously reiterated here, the chapter
headings of this Nazi tome are almost identical to the chapter headings
of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which represented the culmination of this
Nazi blueprint for achieving political control and regional hegemony.
MISGUIDED BRITISH
IDOLATRY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
The British Establishments blind idolatry of our membership of the
disastrous and institutionally corrupt European Union Collective is of
course a scandal of immense proportions, not least in the prevailing
economic and financial context, when the Governments financial problems
could be addressed, as proposed in the preceding report, by diverting all UK
payments destined for the European Commission into a suspense account,
pending the rectification of the Commissions fraudulent financing and
accounting practices.
Since the Commissions accounts have been adjudged to be irregular for the
past 14 years by the European Court of Auditors, it is beyond scandalous
that the British Government still continues to squander more than £50
billion of taxpayers funds per year to finance this corrupt and reprobate
geopolitical, globalist sink-hole.
EMPANELLED
INVESTIGATIONS LOOKING INTO WIDE SPECTRUM OF THIS CORRUPTION
Concerning the United States, there is a dimension of the ever-broadening
unravelling process that we are prevented by US practice and legal
constraints from reviewing.
We refer again to certain empanelled, ongoing judicial processes that have
been engaged in comprehensive investigations into multiple US dimensions of
the fraudulent finance operations, including the criminal alienation of the
original $4.5 trillion, as discussed below, and for instance the Halliburton
operations installed inside the Central Intelligence Agency and in the
Pentagon which have been systematically defrauding the two structures and
the US taxpayer (see
report of 26th May 2008: Archive), profiting from the
Iraqi and Afghan wars and deaths on a prodigious scale.
-
Given these ongoing processes, it seems
to us, and others, to be most unlikely that the high-profile
perpetrators will escape the devastating consequences of their
serial financial crimes.
-
The machinery of the Rule of Law grinds
slowly, but excessively finely. This all TAKES TIME.
PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS
ARE NO USE - CRIMES WERE COMMITTED ABROAD
There has been talk, inevitably, of Presidential pardons, which was what
President Bush Jr. was clearly signaling when, immediately ahead of
Thanksgiving, he was reported to have conducted a ceremony in the Rose
Garden at which he pardoned two turkeys.
-
In practice, Presidential pardons will
provide perpetrators of these crimes with no protection at all,
since the grotesque serial financial crimes in question, including
the stealing of The Queens gold, from which the Clintons profited
(see below), were perpetrated against foreign powers and sovereigns,
starting with Her Majesty The Queen.
One can well imagine, therefore, that, as Secretary of State, Mrs
Clinton would be liable to receive the frostiest of welcomes in
foreign capitals, especially in London, where she might be told in
no uncertain terms that she would not be welcome. (On 1st December,
The Times of London, globalist Rupert Murdochs mouthpiece,
perversely said the exact opposite, namely that the appointment of
this brilliant woman would be enthusiastically welcomed in London,
implying either its crass and culpable ignorance of Queen Melusinas
crimes, or an incompetent failure to understand that her CIA husband
works for DVD chieftain Bush Sr. who has systematically
enronised' both the United States and Britain). How dare this
criminal operative purport to tell other countries what to do when
she herself should be behind bars for at least the 25-year tariff
that lesser (banking) criminals were having to endure due in part to
her own open-ended immorality.
-
Irrespective of her position, she would
certainly be eligible for immediate arrest, incarceration and
indictment without further ado: after all, if the current British
Prime Minister can be threatened with arrest (see below) by Barack
Obama even before he has taken over as President, so can this
arrogant Queen Melusina. There are said to be a number of sealed
indictments against this woman.
Of course the impact of Bush Jr.s ludicrous theatrical performance
was to reconfirm that this deluded fellow may indeed himself be
indistinguishable these days from a terrified turkey an impression
reinforced by the parallel fact that on 24th, 25th and 26th
November, President-Elect Obama gave press conferences at which he
was universally seen to be behaving presidentially an impression
being fostered by no means by accident.
OBAMA ADVISED HE MAY
HAVE TO ASSUME POWER EARLY
For Mr Obama has been advised that he must be prepared to assume office
early, if necessary which is to say that there are indications, confirmed
by several separate sources to this service, that the prescribed
Inauguration Day of 20th January 2008 may be brought forward, or that the
new President may have taken office some time in advance of that date. This
information has not been accompanied by any elaboration.
But it must be obvious that the pressure of
events and of the processes alluded to above may not allow for the luxury
of a transition period of normal duration.
-
This, in turn, accounts for the fact
that Mr Obama has already assembled the key members of his team for
his first term, although we also know, do we not, that all the key
people are selected by the Intelligence Power which runs the
Government, and its structures, not the other way round. The team
has been assembled 'early' because the Obama Administration may
start early.
Whatever the failing anti-propagandists wanted, the reality is that,
in contrast to earlier presidential elections, the outcome in
November 2008 was decisive enabling John McCain to escape from his
agony by conceding defeat and making a very generous speech
congratulating his opponent at the earliest possible moment.
At
8.20pm on 6th November, we were further informed that the current
Provost Marshal had retrieved the controversial NESARA (that is,
National Economic Security and Recovery Act) documents from Chief
Justice John Roberts.
NESARA APPARENTLY
REMOVED FROM THE EQUATION
Since the United States now at last possessed (so far as the controlling
Intelligence Power was concerned, at any rate, which was ALL THAT MATTERED
IN PRACTICE) a constitutionally chosen President-Elect, NESARA was now
clearly redundant.
It is finished.
-
Criminalist President Clinton had signed
the legislation, WHICH WOULD ONLY COME INTO EFFECT WHEN ANNOUNCED,
in the presence of Navy Seals, who eat Marines for breakfast.
It contained provisions for the reform of the United States'
finances and the removal from office of the President, the Vice
President and the Cabinet, and their immediate replacement by an
Interim Administration charged with organizing elections within six
months. NESARA, by the way, explains the original nickname applied
to Bush Jr. of Temporary. It had somehow been assumed that the
Clinton legislation, effectively signed under military duress, would
be implemented under Bush Jr.
-
John Roberts, appointed by Bush Jr. to
head the Supreme Court, was briefed to confiscate and 'sit on' the NESARA papers, presumably because Bush Jr. saw them as a threat to
his rule.
The decisive 2008 election outcome was of course another reason why
John McCain conceded so promptly. Given the outcome, NESARA was no
longer prospectively needed, so the Chief Justice could no longer
justify holding on to the relevant documents, which the current
Provost Marshal accordingly confiscated.
President-Elect Barack
Obama has since indicated that the authority of the Provost Marshal
is to be strengthened under his Presidency, or else has made it
plain that the holder of this office has the President-Elects full
support in the fulfillment of his duties, which, in the prevailing
circumstances, amounts to the same thing.
FINALLY, MAINSTREAM
OUTLETS HINT AT THE REAL CRISIS
On 8th November, CNN came closer than ever before to exposing the
institutionalized financial corruption (which, despite everything we have
published, has been continuing, although Bush Sr. himself has encountered
increasing difficulty in identifying counterparties willing to play
financial games with him any more).
Specifically, CNN reported on its One OClock News that day that two major banks have been caught misusing funds.
They are having to settle once and for all.
The ordinary viewer would not have understood the meaning of once and for
all: but those aware of the immense pressure for completion of the
Settlements, which President-Elect Obama was known (by 13th November) to
have said must be paid immediately, will have understood.
-
This, by the way, reveals that, as has
been known for several years (for certain reasons), CNN has been
aware of this nexus of financial scandals all along.
On 27th November, we were explicitly informed, and it was duly
confirmed, that the US mainstream print and broadcast media had
been instructed by Vice President Cheneys office to refrain from
any mention of these matters whatsoever. Earlier, on 25th November
2008, it had been asserted on MSNBC that Cheney had been controlling
the mainstream media throughout his term in office.
These sudden admissions by mainstream outlets did nothing to
salvage the tarnished reputation of the mainstream, which clearly
assumed, following the election outcome, that it was now safe to
start hinting tentatively at the corruption that it has
systematically suppressed for years.
-
What this means, of course, is that
mainstream organizations that have suppressed knowledge of
criminal operations and practices in high places and within the
financial structures are de facto co-conspirators, accessories to
the fact of these crimes, and clearly guilty, in the first instance,
of offences under the Misprision of Felony Statute.
FIFTH ESTATE HAS
PERFORMED AN END-RUN ROUND THE MAINSTREAM
They are uncomfortable because the Fifth Estate (the Internet) has performed
an end-run around the mainstream (side-stream) media, with the
consequence that millions of thinking Americans and Europeans are now aware,
to some extent, of the existence and implications of this grandfather of all
financial corruption scandals.
A visitor newly arrived from Germany told the
Editor on the 29th November of his sense that many peoples eyes have been
opened to the gross criminality of their governments, of financial
institutions, and of holders of high office across Europe, as well as in the
United States.
In other words, the cat is indeed well and truly
out of the bag.
BLAIR TOLD HE WOULD
NOT BE WELCOME AT CENOTAPH CEREMONY
On 9th November, The Queen and the British nation mourned the dead of the
successive Illuminati wars with the moving annual Cenotaph prayers and
ceremony, which is usually attended also by former Prime Ministers. This
moving ceremony has remained unchanged ever since 1919. On this occasion,
Lady Thatcher was present, walking on the arm of her successor, Sir John
Major.
Also present, of course, were the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, and the
representatives of the other political parties. But former Prime Minister
Tony Blair was absent from the ceremony.
We are informed that Blair was told not to
appear.
POWERFUL CHICAGO
PEOPLE WANT TO BE PAID, TOO
On 13th November 2008 the world was treated to the disturbing spectacle of
five top hedge fund managers, believed to be launderers of George Bush
Sr.s corrupt funds George Soros, James Simons, John Paulson (no
relation), Philp Falcone and Kenneth Griffin testifying before Mr Henry
Waxmans Congressional Committee and blaming the current financial crisis
which of course they have immensely exacerbated thanks to their exotic and
dubious financial excesses, on the system itself.
As we have previously
pointed out, these so-called hedge funds are the venting outlets
straddling the illicit offshore, off-balance sheet, untaxed sector, and the
visible on-balance sheet financial economy.
Large numbers of these funds are now in extreme
difficulties due to avalanches of redemptions; and to stay afloat most have
now closed their doors to further redemptions, locking their investors out,
to the unrestrained fury of many of their number.
-
One of the giga-managers who testified
on 13th November represents a constituency that was double-crossed
by Bush Sr. He therefore turned, believe it or not, to Gold Badges
for assistance.
Knowledgeable observers will no doubt understand the significance of
this. Suffice it to say here, that it is factors like this which,
taken with other considerations such as that the Daley people in
Chicago also want to be paid, and in conjunction with the decisive
powers exercised by MI6 on behalf of The Queen as a consequence of
events described earlier in this series (and later in the present
report), have been driving the resolution of the Settlements
dimension of this crisis.
CLINTON DISMANTLED THE
U.S. ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
In answer to the understandable reiterated question why havent these
high-level criminalists been arrested and brought to justice?, the interim
response that we have ourselves been given is that, during the Clinton
Administration, the enforcement mechanisms were essentially dismantled.
President Clinton was effectively appointed by, a client of, and works for
former President Bush Sr., in a tense relationship that is subject to
periodic eruptions of great fury and is characterized, of course, by the
usual foul Black brew of blackmail, intimidation, false witness, and
threats that are characteristic of the Workers of Darkness.
BACKGROUND TO THE G-20
MEETING ON 15TH NOVEMBER 2008
Meanwhile the worlds media in early November 2008 were becoming more and
more worked up about the preplanned Group of Twenty (G-20) meeting arranged
for Washington, DC, on the 15th November. This meeting was subsequently
reported to have developed and agreed upon a menu of principles for
elaborating by officials and technical specialists, to be reviewed in March
2009 - which of course will be far too late in the day to forestall
calamity, absent other delayed remedies, viz. the Group of Seven - approved
Refinancing Program, which provides for fully transparent and on-the-books
capital markets transactions which will, inter alia, deliver huge ongoing
windfall tax receipts into the hands of the US Treasury, and will reverse
the one-way deficit financing orgy that has continued for the past century,
enriching all parasitical intermediaries such as Goldman Sachs in the
process, and which can only be continued as long as international confidence
in the US dollar remains intact, which is no longer the case.
Since the American Treasury under Paulson systematically destroyed that
confidence and fatally jeopardized the Full Faith and Credit of the United
States because the highest-level criminalists including Paulson himself
were concentrating almost exclusively upon exploiting the fraudulent finance
carousel for their own self-enrichment and in pursuit of their failing
globalist hegemony agenda, the open-ended, one-way deficit-financing orgy is
no longer viable.
The moment is long overdue, therefore, for the G-7-approved Refinancing
Program to be kick-started, as was supposed to have happened in June/July
2006, when the original funds were first criminally alienated by Henry M.
Paulson, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, who initially presided over the
placement under his sole signatory power with Goldman Sachs of the $4.5
trillion brought over from the peoples Bank of China and referenced in the
language of the Petition for a Writ of Mandamus (see our reports dated 24th
June 2007 and 5th July 2007: Archive).
Following exposure of this scandal by this service, Paulson ostensibly had
to have the funds removed from the custody of his former employers.
However it is also known that, although Paulson was only confirmed as US
Treasury Secretary on 10th July 2006, he signed a contract on 20th or 21st
June 2006 with respect to the disposition of the $4.5 trillion. The
discovery at the end of November 2008 that the funds, or some of the funds,
were alienated to Athens, Greece (see below), and the known fact that this
transfer occurred, according to our special informants, about over two
years ago, suggests that the contract signed by Paulson may have related to
the Athens counterparty.
If that is true, then on the face of it, Michael C. Cottrell, M.S., and the
Editor of this service, were comprehensively deceived from the very outset,
and used as a front not simply when a switch occurred at some stage
between 24th June 2007, when the Petition for a Writ of Mandamus was filed,
and our appearance at the Alexandria Court hearing on 19th October 2007, as
postulated elsewhere in this report.
And if THAT is indeed the case, our technique of walking in a straight
line is vindicated, since by doing so, we have procured that the multiple
layers of deception have been progressively stripped away over time,
exposing the theft and frauds that followed the transfer of the original
$4.5 trillion by the Peoples Bank of China. When truth is matched against
falsehood, the truth always prevails, since lies, like plutonium, have a
half-life and decay. They can never be sustained indefinitely because they
are in conflict with the truth, which can never be permanently suppressed.
This means that all intelligence community deception operations are
fundamentally stupid and flawed, as they presuppose that the intended
results will be procured BEFORE the lies have decayed and have been found
out a very risky assumption. In the present giga-deception, the deceivers
have all been found out because we were on their tail at an early stage and
continued walking in a straight line, while the deceivers, as usual,
zigzagged.
They thought that multiple layers of deception
could be relied upon to provide them with protection.
They thought wrong.
BUSH SLOW-HAND-CLAPPED
WHEN HE WALKED OUT AFTER AMERO REJECTION
At the G-20 event in Washington, President
George W. Bush attempted,
incredibly, to sell the international community on
the Bushite plan for
the Amero, thereby providing the first reliable confirmation that this
scheme to impose a common currency on the United States, Canada and Mexico
to replace the US dollar, was among the tricks in the Bush Crime Familys
magic cabinet.
When the representatives of the international community indicated in no
uncertain terms that this trick, which would of course impoverish them
further, and by massive proportions, would NOT be countenanced or tolerated
(i.e., that the Amero would NOT be accepted by foreign central banks),
President George W. Bush Jr., went into a sulk and walked out of the
conference.
As he left the presence of the G-20 representatives, he was slow-handclapped
out of the door.
By this gesture, the international community FINALLY
revealed what they think of this rogue, this mass murderer, this
inveterate
thief, this duplicitous little fellow, this self-serving de facto financial
and economic terrorist who has degraded the United States, its currency and
its reputation on a scale with no historical precedent this would-be
latter-day Herr Hitler who really had intended to stay in power, we now
understand, following an atrocity that had been planned ahead of the 2008
election.
EDITOR BLEW A PLOT
TO STAGE A U.S. DOMESTIC ATROCITY
For we can now reveal that on 27th November 2008 we were advised that a
long time ago Bush 43 and Vice President Richard Cheney had resolved to
have Mr Christopher Story removed from the scene or taken down in some
unspecified manner.
When the Editor enquired why he had not been told this
earlier, there was no answer.
When the Editor asked why whatever they had had
in mind had not been implemented while the Editor was in Washington and New
York in October 2008, he was told that you were protected by too many of
The Queens people on the ground.
When the Editor enquired as to precisely what had caused the President and
the Vice President of the United States to decree, so to speak, that the
Editor should be taken down, he was told words to the effect that you
blew their plan to stage an atrocity as a pretext for imposing martial law
and following through by cancelling the election and implementing a de facto
dictatorship.
This appears to have been a reference to allusions inter alia to prospective
atrocities published in our report dated 25th October 2007, including the
fears of a Twin Cities atrocity that may have been planned to coincide with
the commencement of the Republican National Convention to be held on 1st
September 2008, and to the matter of the missing nuclear weapon, which we
did mention ONCE but only because the matter had already been extensively
covered elsewhere: so that can hardly have been the key trigger that 'blew'
the conspiracy.
Revelation of the Twin Cities plot was a much
more likely candidate. Note: We did, separately, report recently that Bush
41 was believed to have demanded that the Editor of this service be removed
from the equation.
However the first that we and associates heard of any possible Bush-Cheney
intention to interfere with the Editor and this service was in
January/February 2008. The shootings episodes at the turn of last year,
which certainly involved deaths but possibly of at least one double, may
have been a part of this operation, with the objective of discrediting the
opponents of the financial criminality in high places.
It is possible that this intention remained
pending for eight months or so, until certain decisive steps were taken in
Britain by the Editor of this service on behalf of his US associates in
September 2008, which put an end to any such intentions. Certainly, the
Editor was not interfered with when attending the IMF Spring Meetings in
April 2008, and subsequently while residing in New York.
Thus, such intentions appear to have been
overruled, or overtaken by events.
POLITICIANS TRYING TO
GET PAID BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE
With the roof collapsing on top of them as the full force of these exposures
slaps them in the face, corrupt Washington politicians were reported to us
on 2nd December to be scrambling to impose their will on those in charge of
the Settlements payouts, holding out their filthy hands for money in the
hope of having funds channeled to their 'foundations', in payment for
'services rendered', i.e. corruption, before any payments to Trustees and
others were or could be made.
However the real reason for this revolting
spectacle is believed to be fear among these rats that they won't be paid at
all, if they aren't paid first. Never in world history has such a despicable
bunch of corrupt hacks behaved in such a primitive, unseemly way. They have
no shame: they want 'their' money, so they can get out. And they want to get
out because it's terribly hot inside.
But they want 'their' money.
Very late on 2nd December, the Editor was authoritatively informed that the
'Big Boys' were to be paid on 3rd December. The phrase 'Big Boys' in this
context means the corrupt Washington, DC, politicians. When the Editor asked
for an indication of their identities, names like Kennedy, Dodd, Bush Jr.,
Clinton and other well-known political crooks were mentioned.
Christopher
Dodd is the grandson of Stalin (Josef Djiugashvili-Kochba), in case you had
forgotten.
VERY SERIOUS QUESTIONS
THAT GEITHNER HAS TO ANSWER
In late November, it became known that Mr Obama had selected Timothy Geithner, currently President of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as
his nominee for US Treasury Secretary.
It is known that this man is currently being watched like a hawk, given
his association with Robert Rubin, the Clintons operative guarding their
illicit interests at Citibank, in midtown Manhattan. As late as Friday 21st
November 2008, Robert Rubin was reported to have interfered with Settlement
payments.
Obviously, even one of Bush Jr.s pardoned
turkeys would be an improvement over the serial financial criminal, Henry M.
Paulson, or his double, whom Timothy Geithner will be replacing, provided
the new Senate can approve his credentials. But is that possible?
For serious questions arise in connection with this selection, notably
concerning Gaithners past exercise of his fiduciary responsibilities, his
ethical record, and whether he, like so many of these people, has been, for
instance, in breach of the Misprision of Felony Statute.
Since we are concerned about economic terrorism having been relentlessly
waged against the United Kingdom, in particular, by the familiar bunch of US
criminals in the highest places, these questions necessitate the closest
possible consideration, which we believe may be being given to them by the
empanelled judicial processes mentioned earlier.
It will be recalled in this context that following lodgment of the Petition
for a Writ of Mandamus with the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Alexandria [Civil Action No: 1-07 CV 609 TSE BRP: see text
published in our reports dated
24th June 2007 and
5th July 2007:
Archive]
demanding performance in respect of the missing $4.5 trillion that was sent
over in good faith by the Peoples Bank of China, the US Federal Reserve
Bank of Richmond had responded that the Petitioners remedy lay within the
jurisdiction of the United States Eastern District of New York.
-
The relevant passage of the Petition for
a Writ of Mandamus reads as follows:
In May of 2006 the Peoples Republic of China caused a free and
unrestricted transfer of $4.5 Trillion United States Dollars through
international bank fund transfer facilities to an account at Bank of
America located at Richmond, Virginia. The designated beneficiary of
the transferred funds from the Peoples Republic of China was
Petitioner herein. This transfer was made by the Peoples Republic
of China solely and exclusively as a requirement under the mentioned
[Wanta] settlement agreement. Upon best information and belief
between the dates of July 31st to August 2nd of 2006 the United
States Department of the Treasury, without authorization of either
the remitting party or the receiving party removed the Peoples
Republic of China transferred financial assets from Bank of America,
Richmond, Virginia to an account in the name of Goldman Sachs at
Citibank New York, New York as the beneficiary holder of the monies
transferred by the Peoples Republic of China referenced above.
This Chip (Clearing House Interbank Payment) transfer was
facilitated from Virginia domiciled banks to New York domiciled
banks via the Federal Reserve Bank Richmond. The Chip transfer did
not remove the name of Petitioner as the intended recipient of the
transferred money from the Peoples Republic of China.
The transfer to the Goldman Sachs et al. account at Citibank put a
lawless restriction that the funds were not to be released to
Petitioner without the authorization of United States Treasury.
This passage is also reproduced on page 57 of International Currency
Review Volume 33, Numbers 3 & 4, the huge double issue mailed to the
international financial community worldwide on 14th July 2008, under
the heading: DIVERSION OF WANTA-OWNED FUNDS REMITTED BY CHINESE.
WHY RICHMOND FED
SAID THAT REMEDY LIES WITHIN THE NEW YORK JURISDICTION
In our reported posted on 25th October 2007 [see Archive], under the heading
CONSPIRACY TO DEPRIVE WANTA OF COURT DOCUMENTS, we published the full text
of a last-minute Affidavit submitted to the Court by Attorney Steven
Goodwin, whose Richmond office was the Registered Office of AmeriTrust
Group, Inc, in which various convoluted reasoning was advanced to explain
why the documents generated as a consequence of the Petition were never seen
by the Petitioner.
-
Our report of 25th October 2007
contained, however, a reference to a hearing that the Petitioner
ostensibly, therefore, never knew about, dated 7th September 2007.
-
The relevant language of our report
referenced:
The Response filed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and
heard by Judge Ellis... on 7th September, wherein the Richmond Fed
suggested that the remedy... lies within the jurisdiction of the
United States Eastern District Court of New York.
THE REAL REASON OUR
4TH OCTOBER 2007 REPORT WAS SNIPPED
Our report dated 25th October 2007 then stated that our related report dated
4th October 2007 had been snipped, and at the time we thought over-hastily
that this had probably occurred because it characterizes Citibank as a
criminal enterprise.
We elaborated with words to the effect that it
was quite stupid of Fort Meade to snip this report, given that in so doing
it appeared to confirm the accuracy of this statement. However, as has now
become apparent, there were much more telling reasons why our report dated
4th October 2007 [see
Archive] had been snipped.
For that report also contained the following
language:
Given that the Federal Reserve Bank of
Richmond accepts all well pleaded facts as true, the Richmond Fed
further reconfirmed, in the most authoritative manner possible, that the
funds had been placed with an account in the name of Goldman Sachs at
Citibank, New York... In its Brief in Support of its Motion to Dismiss,
the US Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond elaborated that [the Petitioner]
has an adequate remedy under Article 4A (Funds Transfer) of the Uniform
Commercial Code by demanding that Citibank release to him the funds
held by that bank for his benefit'.
In other words, the relevant funds were held
within the jurisdiction of the United States Court for the Eastern District
of New York, namely the jurisdiction within which the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, of which Timothy Gaithner was President, resides.
PANTOMIME ANTICS AT
THE ALEXANDRIA COURT HEARING
Now, at the hearing at the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Alexandria held on 19th October 2007 that your correspondent
attended, Judge Ellis was not at all impressed with the behavior of the
Petitioner on the witness stand, so much so that the Judge more or less
ignored everything said from the stand. At the time, the Editor thought this
was very odd.
The reason for this behavior, it has now transpired, is that another deal
may have been done at some stage between the lodgment of the Petition in
late June 2007 and the hearing on the 19th October, whereby the funds had
been diverted to Athens, Greece.
It was therefore necessary to bring the
Petition for a Writ of Mandamus proceedings to an indeterminate conclusion,
as it had reached its sell-by date.
-
NOTE: However it is suggested
elsewhere that the funds were alienated to Athens much earlier, in
which case the matter of the way we were deceived is much more
serious, as in that case we would have been deceived from the
outset. Either way, the deceivers deserve no sympathy.
This explains why it then became necessary for the Petitioner to
part company with Christopher Story (as he put it to Michael C.
Cottrell, M.S.), whom the Petitioner called an honest journalist,
which is very rare (in a telephone conversation during the first
quarter of 2008).
In other words, the services of this honest journalist were now an
impediment to the Petitioners interests, since a possibly parallel
deal (see below) may have been done with Cheney et al. behind the
scenes while the legal process was continuing, and an honest
journalist, Christopher Story, could not possibly be informed of
this fact and would be liable to 'get in the way' now.
-
This background also explains why the
Petitioner angrily told the Editor in a fractured telephone
conversation in March 2008 that 'YOU HAVE DESTROYED EVERYTHING'.
-
For everything here, read the illegal
diversion of the funds, inter alia to Athens (see below).
ROBERT RUBIN RAN THE
MONEY AND THE DIVERSIONS
This diversion had been orchestrated by the corrupt former President
Clintons main mole inside Citibank/Citigroup, one Robert Rubin, the former
US Treasury Secretary, who authored a prominent article published in the
Wall Street Journal dated 29th November, the theme of which was Its not my
fault.
[The Editor calls the habit that these people
routinely adopt of protesting too much when cornered, Blankfeinism, after
the display of supreme arrogance by Paulsons successor as CEO at Goldman
Sachs, Mr Blankfein, who boasted in the summer of 2007 about how well his
institution had been doing, when of course it had been engaged in dodgy
financial manipulations as exposed inter alia by this service].
Confirmation that the original $4.5 trillion funds were diverted by Robert
Rubin from Citibank to an account or accounts located in Athens, and that
the funds had been so diverted for perhaps two + years, was obtained by this
service between 11.30pm and midnight on Wednesday 26th November 2008. For
their part, certain Greek parties could not understand what on earth was
going on, with some concluding that the Americans had gone completely mad.
Whether the transactions were in any way facilitated by John Negroponte, of
Greek Jewish extraction, and /or by Olga Sarantopoulos, is not known at this
juncture.
It may also be recalled that in the late fall of 2007, the Treasurer of the
United States, Ms. Anna Escobedo Cabral, held a meeting with Robert Rubin at
Citibank, which she was reported to have left in a seriously discontented
frame of mind.
It was even rumored that Ms. Cabral had
indicated that she would not stand for this endless corruption any longer,
would do her best to procure the Settlements, and would then resign. What
the US Treasurer is believed to have found out during that meeting was that
certain missing funds had been diverted to Athens.
Reverberations from this and related scandals were still roiling
Citibank/Citigroup, one of the CIAs favored 'helpful' institutions, as late
as mid-November 2008. On the 13th November, the institution issued the
following brief statement:
The Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc.
today reiterated its full support for the companys chairman, Sir Win
Bischoff, and said it looks forward to its continued leadership. This
mornings Wall Street Journal report to the contrary is completely
erroneous.
The erroneous report had referenced
allegations that senior Citigroup staff members had been unhappy with Sir
Wins oversight of Chief Executive Vikram Pandit and his management team,
and had suggested that Dick Parsons, the banks senior independent director,
was possibly being lined up to replace Sir Win Bischoff, who was parachuted
into Citibank in part to serve inter alia as the guardian of The Queens
loan funds with the bank.
But in translation, it can be seen that the pressure on Robert Rubin will
have been intense, and that a belated rearguard action may have been mounted
to rid the bank of HM The Queens de facto representative and of the
influence of MI6 in procuring the necessary overdue resolution of the
Settlements dimension of this vast crisis, without collapsing Citibank and
causing thereby a worldwide depression (the ace that Robert Rubin has of
course been cynically playing).
On 21st November, Rubin was STILL reported, as
noted, to have tried hard to block the Settlements.
GEITHNER MUST DIVULGE
WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT THESE DIVERSIONS
The problem facing Timothy Geithner is that, as President of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, he will need to explain to a Senate hearing that
is doing its job properly, and almost certainly to the empanelled judicial
processes, exactly what was his involvement in these various criminal
diversions of other peoples money.
He will also need to answer questions about how
it came to pass that profits illegally derived from the stealing of Her
Majesty The Queens gold on 29th-30th March 2007 came to be deposited inter
alia in secret offshore, off-balance sheet accounts held at Citibank for,
-
Bush Sr. (41)
-
Bush Jr. (43)
-
William Jefferson Clinton (42)
-
Mrs Hillary
Clinton
-
Henry M. Paulson
-
Vice President Richard B. Cheney
-
Robert Rubin
-
Dr Alan Greenspan
-
Dr Ben Bernanke
-
and other high-level crooks as
beneficiaries...
This information came from top US military
sources.
-
YES, the top criminalists MADE MONEY OUT
OF THE STEALING OF THE QUEEN'S GOLD and placed their portions of the
proceeds in their illegal, untaxed, off-balance sheet hidden
accounts with the CIA's primary money-laundering criminal
enterprise, Citibank. WHICH IS TO SAY, that the Bushes, Clintons,
Cheney, Paulson et al. were ALL engaged in FINANCING TERRORISM and
in ECONOMIC TERRORISM against Her Majesty the Queen and the British
State and people.
-
In other words, these top criminals, who
rant and rave about global terrorism, are themselves veteran
terrorists, engaged in the financing of terrorism by their own
definitions, illustrating once again the double-mindedness of these
snakes. AND, TO COIN A PHRASE, IT GETS MUCH WORSE.
PROVOST MARSHAL
BARRED FROM ENTERING SECRET ROOM INSIDE MORGAN STANLEY
In October 2007, the Provost Marshal of the day, with appropriate back-up,
visited the offices of Morgan Stanley in New York City. We alluded to the
activities of the Provost Marshal extensively in our reports dated between
4th October 2007 and
11th November 2007 [see
Archive].
The Provost Marshal
at that time was under the control of (criminal) Vice President Richard B.
Cheney.
Our impeccable sources were unable to inform the Editor, but are now able to
inform us, that:
-
The Provost Marshal and his team
attempted to obtain entry to a locked room inside the Morgan Stanley
building. They were specifically barred from entering this room, by
Morgan Stanley staff, who stood outside the doors and prevented them
from entering.
-
The purpose of the Provost Marshal's
demand for entry to this room was to obtain back-up evidence that
Morgan Stanley, the CEO of which remains John Mack, was engaged in
financing terrorism operations in general, and Al-Qaeda in
particular, from this room.
-
How did the Provost Marshal know this?
Because following the arrests bankers in Europe which we also
reported during that period, investigators had obtained tear-sheets
PROVING that such terrorism financing operations were being run out
of this room at Morgan Stanley.
Specifically, the tear-sheets carried
the finger-prints of the following criminal operatives holding the
highest US offices:
-
George H. W. Bush Sr.
-
Vice President Richard B. Cheney
-
Henry M. Paulson Jr.
-
Dr. Alan Greenspan
-
William Jefferson Clinton
-
Mrs Hillary Clinton (these being the
names confirmed to us, but of course there were others, too)
The tear-sheets referenced key secret
bank accounts, access to which was blocked off and which the Provost
Marshal, controlled by Cheney at the time, was unable to inspect. At
the time, our sources were ordered NOT to convey this information to
us.
SECRET ROOM FROM
WHICH AL-QAEDA AND OTHER TERRORIST OPERATIONS WERE FUNDED
We are told that this room housed contracts and other documents relating to
the use of funds in the secret bank accounts referenced immediately above.
The operations directed from this secret Morgan Stanley room or office suite
were concerned SPECIFICALLY with the terrorist-financing of Al-Qaeda and
other international terrorism operations, according to our sources.
This means that, as stated above, ALL those
named by military sources as beneficiaries of the secret 'offshore'
accounts, headed by Mr Paulson as US Treasury Secretary, were engaged in the
diversion of illicit funds for the purposes of financing terrorism and
Al-Qaeda, which the United States and Britain routinely blame for the
terrorist abominations that are being financed through these operations run
out of the secret office inside Morgan Stanley.
-
Thus it is finally determined that the
world's most dangerous revolutionary pariah state is indeed the
United States, with the United Kingdom, in a disreputable and
reprobate breach with what Great Britain is supposed to stand for,
aiding and abetting these hideous, murderous abominations.
-
No wonder Blair's 'confession' is
reported to be causing these odious criminals nightmares.
Therefore, the Directors of Morgan Stanley and
of Citibank stand accused of being engaged in the FINANCING OF TERRORISM,
along with Messrs,
-
Bush Sr.
-
Bush Jr.
-
the former President Clinton
-
Mrs
Hillary Clinton (who may soon be pontificating all over the world's stage
excoriating Al-Qaeda and even banging on about Osama Bin Laden (the CIA's
'Tim Osman') whom these fools have to keep alive in order to sustain their
strategic deception, even though he died on 26th December 2001
-
Vice
President Richard B. Cheney
-
the former and current Chairmen of the
Federal Reserve Board, Drs. Greenspan and Bernanke
-
Robert
Rubin
...and other co-conspirators in this BIGGEST FINANCIAL CORRUPTION,
TERRORISM AND POLITICAL SCANDAL IN WORLD HISTORY.
CHENEY RAN THE MEDIA,
RUBIN RAN THE MONEY
In the above context, it was reconfirmed with the same batch of intelligence
that Vice President Cheney had been running the media while Robert Rubin
had been running the money all of which had been going on while we were
steadily chipping away at the endless deceptions, lies, diversionary tactics
and obfuscations with our Wantagate reports, and thereafter.
The Sunday Times, London, of 30th November 2008, carried an extensive
article which accurately confirmed that President-Elect Obama had been
obliged to seize the initiative so as to fill the de facto vacuum at the top
in the United States, given that every strand of US policy has long been
atrophied by the corrupt behavior of the holders of the highest offices, who
have done hardly anything since mid-2006 except manipulate the illicit
movement of funds so as to extract as much money for lining their own
pockets as possible, and to satisfy and make whole the furious demands and
elevated expectations of heinous, ruthless Black Ops interests and of
innumerable corrupt constituencies who have been double-crossed by the Box
Gang (the Bush-Clinton Crime Nexus).
OBAMA OSTENSIBLY
INSISTING ON FINAL SETTLEMENT IN FULL
On Monday 24th November 2008, the President-Elect signed papers requiring
the Settlements to be implemented. In the batch of information received late
on 26th November, it was confirmed that Mr Obama has been insisting on
settlement, a fact that had been confirmed to us earlier in an email dated
13th November 2008 (received at 01:47am) from a Trustee to the effect that
that Obama has said we must be paid immediately.
The sources stated, and it was later confirmed, that Mr Obama has been
absolutely appalled at what he had found out following his election victory
and that his shock has been all the greater because he had realized that
Vice President-Elect Biden had known all about this open-ended criminality.
The Editor speculates that it has been the shock of these discoveries of
this wall-to-wall deception, corruption and blatant criminality, that
accounts for Obama's compulsion (given the unprecedented and extraordinary
circumstances of this crisis) to act presidentially.
Americans use this phrase rather loosely and perhaps a trifle cynically. But
here, the gravity of the chaos and the corruption is so extreme that the
incoming President was immediately left with no option but to respond in a
responsible and vigorous manner. Which he did.
It is also true, of course, that in presiding over the Settlements and
procuring the implementation of the G-7-Approved Refinancing Program, the
President-Elect will ensure that the disaster that otherwise awaits his
Presidency will in fact be transformed over time into a triumphant success.
This is NOT play-acting: it implies confirmation of strength of character,
determination, an iron will and of a man who, whatever faults he like
everyone else may possess, has immediately risen to the immense challenges
that he unexpectedly faces given the circumstances and the derailing of
the various schemes and plots to have him removed from the scene.
After the
Bush Jr. White House had tried to bribe him, Mr Obama must have entertained
no remaining doubts about the extreme gravity of the Republics crisis, and
must have been reinforced in his belief in his mission to help the United
States climb out of the worst outbreak of financial iniquity the Republic
has ever faced.
On Saturday 22nd November 2008, a week after the G-20 meeting and after
George Bush Jr. had finally ceased his resistance (so it was being said, not
that Mr Bush had any power to resist left), the 'country payees' received
what was grossly overdue to them in cash. We realize that there have been
earlier occasions when 'the countries' were reported to have been paid
(which have turned out to be occasions when their dollar funds were
on-screen but not accessed): but the point here is that this information
concerning wholesale payments was received over the weekend of 22nd-23rd
November, and confirmed by separate sources on 1st December 2008.
For the countries to have been paid, a key Tier Two US Trustee must have
needed to deploy his instruments, which were integral to the countries being
paid. This information was accompanied by indications that US Treasury
securities had been issued for the Settlement throughout the week following
the G-20 meeting, with Tier Three payees therefore likely to be paid with
Treasuries.
A caveat applies to all such information, however, namely that, given
banking secrecy, none of this can be verified, even though some such
information is confirmed: it is all, by definition, based on hearsay
which is why we have usually avoided referencing such intelligence. But at
this late stage, some indication of what is supposed to have been happening,
is necessary.
A key Trustee payable with the countries, should
have been paid, at the latest, on or by Sunday 30th November.
OBAMA 'WORKING IN
LOCK-STEP WITH SARKOZY AND MI6'
Mr Obamas presidential behavior has been buttressed by the fact that
President Sarkozy of France, who is also President of the European Union
until 31st December this year, and Britains MI6 (elements truly serving HM
The Queen) are working in lock-step with the President-Elect to procure
finalization of the Settlements, not least in conformity with the
instructions and deadline imposed upon the French President requiring him to
fulfill his new mandate to pay obtained when President Bush Jr. finally
ceded what he thought was still his authority in the matter, as previously
described by this service.
Unfortunately, both the President-Elect and President Sarkozy encountered
further resistance not from Chancellor Merkel who as we reported in
October, had been on Mr Bush Sr.s corrupt payroll for four years in
exchange for looking after Bush-linked funds that we now know were flowing
to and from Deutsche Bank and the Vatican Bank (controlled by Merkels agent
there, Dr Hans Tietmeyer) via the de facto clearing house in London, Coutts
Bank but from the current British Prime Minister, GORDON BROWN.
GORDON BROWN
CONFIRMED AS IMPEDING THE SETTLEMENTS
PRESIDENT-ELECT BARACK OMABA THREATENS BROWN WITH ARREST
The batch of intelligence obtained by this service between 11.30pm and
midnight UK time on that Wednesday 26th November, all of which was confirmed
to be 100% accurate (with the exception of an allegation that active Gold
Badges had been instructed to take Story down, an instruction that is now
believed to be redundant anyway), contained the following:
-
Gordon Brown had lately been impeding
finalization of the Settlements: in other words there has been no
discontinuity between Blair and Brown in respect of the sabotage;
and:
-
President-Elect Obama sent an agent over
to London to speak directly to the Prime Minister with the following
stark message: If you interfere any further with the Settlements
payouts, YOU WILL BE ARRESTED. In this connection, Barack Obama will
have issued this warning with the full authority of Sarkozy,
equipped with his said mandate to pay, backed by the right MI6
elements.
When we obtained confirmation of this
intelligence, we were advised that relevant parties had become aware that
someone at very high level in London must have been standing in the way,
given that almost all other known blockages had been removed, with many
arrests having taken place across Europe during November, as in the
preceding several months.
On 24th November, we had another episode of the waiting for bank
answerbacks syndrome, it being confirmed later that one bank had failed to
provide the necessary answerback, as a direct consequence of which the
banker in question had been arrested.
There is a suspicion that this
sabotage occurred in London and may have been directly connected to the fact
that Mr Brown was found to have been impeding the Settlements.
-
NOTE: It remains possible that
what has been happening is an expanded version of the 'pass the
parcel' technique whereby the scene constantly shifts between the
players, with the spotlight then directed from one to the next one,
while the action has already moved to the subsequent crook: a more
extensive game than was being played by the highest-level
criminalists in 2007 and earlier in 2008, when 'A' 'washes his
hands' of the matter and then points to 'B', who has carefully
developed his alibi while the action is being corruptly handled by
'C', as the spotlight lingers on 'B'. That model was seen in the US
context: perhaps it is now being applied internationally, with the
overall aim of sabotaging performance.
-
Last week it was Sarkozy. This week it's
Brown. Next week, its Bush again. After all, these rats, as
previously advised, are all out of the same sewer.
-
In any given sewer, each rat is
different, yet every rat is the same colour. All of them stink.
SUDDEN REHABILITATION
OF MANDELSON 'EXPLAINED'
We are led to believe that the discovery, at this latest of all stages, that
Gordon Brown had been impeding the Settlements, has placed this Prime
Minister in the same position as his predecessor during his final months in
office, when he was under extreme pressure from sources in authority to step
down from Downing Street.
Given this state of affairs, some new light is
hereby thrown on the sudden reappearance of two sinister characters at the
centre of the Government in Whitehall and Downing Street.
We refer to:
-
Peter [now Lord] Mandelson,
who was suddenly pulled out of Brussels, where he had been serving
as European Trade Commissioner, and has surfaced as Business
Secretary at the very centre of the Government, with at times
nowadays a higher profile than the Prime Minister.
Mandelson is believed to be a direct Rothschild agent and operates
with a brief that will go nowhere' (see below), to push the Brown
Government into ditching the pound in favor of the Euro, a line now
openly supported by the compromised President of the European
Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
Given that the Prime Minister,
Gordon Brown, has recently been fingered obstructing the
Settlements, he may now see capitulation on this central issue as
his own route to salvation and as a means of wreaking revenge on The
Queen. More generally, as this grandfather of all financial
corruption crises unravels, powerful interests are finding their
positions threatened, oligarchs are being cut down to size or wiped
out, and the furniture is being thrown all around the room, much of
it broken into smaller pieces or even ground to dust.
-
Alistair Campbell, Tony Blairs
notorious former press agent, a.k.a. chief intelligence handler,
who has suddenly reappeared in Number 10 Downing Street, we
understand.
It is possible that the reappearance of these people may have had
something to do with Gordon Browns irregular behavior, which we
first identified in the following paragraph published in the report
dated 18th June 2008:
WHY DID BROWN
FLY TO NORTHERN IRELAND HAVING EARLIER
SAID GOODBYE TO THE BUSHES ON THE STEPS OF DOWNING STREET?
We will now pose the following question. WHY was it necessary for Brown,
who had seen George Bush in the morning of Monday 16th June, to rush up to
Northern Ireland so as to be in a position to be standing on the tarmac at
Belfast airport, to greet the President and Laura when they arrived in
Northern Ireland?
After all, he had just said goodbye to President
Bush. Perish the thought that the purpose of his presence there might have
been to open bank accounts.
Perish the thought.
-
REMARKABLE FACT: The Editor was
subsequently informed that this observation alerted the relevant US
and British authorities to the fact that Bush flew to Northern
Ireland precisely to open bank accounts and that Brown was
associated with this activity. Many weeks later the Editor was told
that Brown had subsequently been educated.
However it now appears, given the intelligence received and
confirmed on 26th November 2008, that Brown did not learn his
lessons well, i.e., the fool paid no attention (3).
We believe, therefore, that Gordon Brown is now
de facto a lame duck a NEW fact which, very surprisingly, seems already
to have been sensed by certain mainstream outlets, given one or two sudden
reversals performed by journalists in respect of their assessments of Mr
Browns political position.
For, all of a sudden, after the Prime Minister
had been at the receiving end of a peculiar avalanche of domestic and
international praise for his robust response to the crisis (which he and
his predecessor helped to generate), we read that his standing has declined
sharply as economic and financial conditions have deteriorated ever more
steeply during the past couple of weeks.
[Note: In an obvious attempt to reverse the impression created by earlier
opinion polls, a new poll published in The Daily Telegraph on Tuesday 2nd
December suggested that the Conservatives' poll lead over the Labour
Government had collapsed to just 1%.
It should be recalled that these opinion polls
are actually a device to enable the 'controllers' to see which way the wind
is blowing, but that they are also used to confuse the people, to sway the
thinking of gullible journalists, and to trim the perceptions of targeted
constituencies, in order to fine-tune (in this case) an evolving and highly
charged political situation, in which many senior figures' careers may be on
the line].
BROWN IMPEDING,
MANDELSON SUPPOSEDLY ALLEVIATING
The situation described above is even more convoluted when one considers the
contrasting overt behavior of the Prime Minister and of Lord Mandelson, the
Rothschild agent he has hauled back from Brussels and installed in the
Cabinet at the centre of Government as Business Secretary.
On the one hand (see above), Gordon Brown is found to have been impeding the
outstanding settlements payouts even though we have been advised that, as
of 22nd November, President Bush Jr. had finally agreed to the releases,
notwithstanding that he had weeks earlier provided President Sarkozy with an
irrevocable mandate to pay while on the other hand Mr Brown's newly
appointed Business Secretary has been issuing rapid-fire edicts and
statements purporting to signal the British Governments commitment to the
struggling industrial and business sectors.
But on closer inspection it would appear that Lord Mandelsons stance is
curiously ambivalent. For instance, he told The Sunday Telegraph (30th
November 2008) that he had submitted a preliminary paper to the Labour
Partys National Economic Council in late November which he explained as
follows: I made the point that there has to be a screening process to
distinguish between those [industries] which are viable and those which are
not. But we also need to take account of our own resources and European
state aid rules.
So, leaving aside the fact that President-Elect Obama had to take the
extraordinary step of sending an emissary to Number 10 Downing Street to
inform the Prime Minister directly that if he continued to block the
settlements, WHICH ARE THE SOLUTION TO LORD MANDELSONS PROBLEMS over the
medium term as the G-7 Approved Refinancing Program will generate the
necessary flow of on-the-books liquidity to refinance the US and European
banks on the books, the overt position at the very end of November 2008 was
that
-
the Prime Minister had been SABOTAGING
the ONLY available solution, while,
-
his former enemy, Peter Mandelson, who
must surely be aware of this, was busily setting limits and citing
obstacles to the provision of state assistance to Britains rapidly
crumbling business and industrial sectors.
At the very least, this does suggest a truly
constipated, dislocated directorate at the centre of British governance
which needs to be swept away if the country is not indeed to sink into a
depression which could make 1929 look like a seaside holiday.
ECONOMIC TERRORISTS IN
DOWNING STREET?
But at worst, the two most powerful figures in the British Government,
Gordon Brown and Lord Mandelson, had themselves been exacerbating Britains
problems by blocking (at least until late November) the Settlements payouts,
thereby assisting the interests of the Bush-Clinton Crime Syndicate and the
Octopus, which in turn implies that both these characters may themselves be
engaged in perpetrating economic terrorism against the Monarch, the United
Kingdom and its people, and should therefore be arrested under the European
anti-terrorism laws adopted by the Westminster Parliament: which,
presumably, is what President-Elect Barack Obama had in mind when, with the
support of President Sarkozy and MI6, he had to dispatch a special emissary
to inform Mr Brown that he would be arrested if he continued to block the
Settlements.
There may indeed, therefore, be the soundest reasons for believing that the
very sudden transfer of Mandelson (previously a sworn enemy of Mr Brown, and
a man who is known to have excoriated Brown in the past, behind his back, in
the most bitter terms), to the very epicenter of the Brown Labour
Government, appears to represent a defiant and desperate move by the Prime
Minister to wrap European protection around himself while at the same time
appearing to be getting back at The Queen, and effectively changing
sides a stance apparently reinforced by the sudden reappearance of
Blairs former handler, Alistair Campbell, in Downing Street.
-
If so, Gordon Brown may have been
sharply disabused of this thinking or strategy, as on 2nd December
The Financial Times reported that the Prime Minister had 'quashed'
Barroso's claim that the economic crisis was driving Britain to
abandon sterling and 'find refuge with' the Euro. Mr Brown's
spokesman (INTERESTINGLY, he was not named, which is VERY UNUSUAL,
implying that this was a PLANTED article) was said to have 'been
forced by Barroso's remarks' to state that there are 'no plans' for
Britain to join the European Collective Currency.
-
'Changing sides' among the operatives on
the stage is all the rage during this 'discontinuity' period, when
the correlation of forces is being shaken from top to bottom. It may
explain, for instance, the appearance of Mrs Clinton as prospective
Secretary of State under Barack Obama. More significantly, however,
the trade-off here incorporates the following equation: Mrs Clinton
may believe she is 'safe' from the consequences of her crimes if
confirmed by the Senate, while in exchange Mr Obama will know that
SHE knows she cannot step out of line, or she will be 'chopped' by
the President-Elect, whereupon she will immediately be vulnerable to
arrest and its aftermath.
Operative Campbell ostensibly serves John
Scarlett of MI6, whose notorious orientation towards the European Union
Collective (the long-range Abwehr/DVD anti-nation state strategic entrapment
instrument) is well known.
MI6 appears to be split, as would be expected,
along similar fault lines as the criminal enterprise known as the CIA
between the pro-pan-German faction, and those who still try, against immense
odds, but do quite well in the grim circumstances, loyally to serve their
home countries and their Heads of State.
If the foregoing analysis is reasonably accurate, any such plot to leverage
the present situation to yank Britain out of sterling and into the Euro will
fail.
The reason is that Britain can never abandon the pound, which was one of the
world currencies designated at Bretton Woods to operate in parallel with the
US dollar. The international trading system cannot allow the pound to cease
to exist because it is a mainstay with the dollar, and now China, of the
international trading system. For international trading arrangements to
function, there must be at least two world currencies in the mix, to allow
offsetting to take place.
The Euro cannot be used as a mainstay currency for
this purpose as it is a wholly artificial currency that is supported by both
nothing and no government. The yen can be used for offsetting purposes, but
it was not a currency that was available when the Bretton Woods system was
established as Japan was an Axis country and its currency was of course
anathema.
Hence, all talk of Britain joining the Euro which it is now quite possible
Brown may have suddenly sought to embrace behind the scenes, given the
pressure he is under following his treachery with Bush last June and his
blocking of the Settlements is eyewash.
For EC President Barroso to wade in with verbal pressure designed to take
advantage of Browns predicament, smells of a hopeless rearguard response.
That leaves the question: who, then, will take over if Brown has to go? And
the answer, on this analysis, would be Mandelson if that had not been
precluded (unless he renounces his new peerage) by the fact that he is in
the House of Lords. Mandelson may well be operating in conjunction with
Messrs Barroso and Rothschild to try to bounce Britain into the Euro, but
this endeavor, like Browns premiership, is doomed.
All of which illuminates what Brown was REALLY up to when he bounded around
the world stage and received a substantial, but very fragile, uplift in the
British domestic public opinion polls (the mechanism used by the
'controllers' to gauge the way the wind is blowing), as the gale-force winds
of this crisis assumed hurricane proportions.
He was promoting A NEW BRETTON WOODS, so that the unique position of the
pound sterling laid down in the Bretton Woods agreement could then be
scrapped, the continued existence of the old Bretton Woods Agreement being
an irremovable impediment to the DVD's project for scrapping the pound.
Now that this little ruse has been exposed, and
you are for the high-jump, Mr Brown, your clumsy behavior in seeking to
have the existing Bretton Woods Agreement swept away, is DEAD IN THE WATER,
mate.
You were trying to be 'too clever by half', and
you messed up BIG TIME.
SIGNS OF THE
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM CRACKING UP
Turning to the concomitant collapse of the economy, quite apart from the
daily headline news about well-known high street and corporate names in
severe financial trouble, there are ominous signs that the real economys
distribution system is on the verge of breaking down.
-
According to experts on classical Rome,
the primary factor, aside from decadence, that brought Rome to its
knees leaving vast tracts of the city itself abandoned and
deserted for a millennium and more was the disintegration of the
distribution system.
The Romans had perfected certain mass production techniques for
goods in widespread demand, such as vessels for the transportation
of wine, roof tiles, domestic house-wares, shoes and other products,
which depended upon an efficient system of distribution to reach
their markets.
Archaeologists have long since taken note of the sharp deterioration
in the quality of, say, roof tiles that took place somewhat abruptly
in the fourth century or earlier. The main reason for this rapid
deterioration is believed to be that the distribution system
collapsed, which in turn brought the mass production operations to a
halt.
-
People in need of roofing tiles were
therefore reduced either to stealing them from abandoned buildings,
turning to local sources of manufacture, or making the artifacts
themselves.
On 18th November, Atradius, the United Kingdoms largest credit
insurer, confirmed that it was clawing back the insurance offered to
suppliers to at least 12,000 British businesses. The insurer
provides cover against non-payment of bills for goods supplied on
credit.
The Financial Times reported on 19th November
that one broker had said that the withdrawal by the Atradius corporation was
unprecedented in my life, adding that up to 20,000 British corporations
may have been affected over the preceding two weeks alone. Another broker
asserted that the UK construction, retail and leisure sectors had been
affected and that the Government might soon have to provide credit or
insurance to struggling suppliers.
Smaller suppliers typically, and usually with good reason, do not trust
larger corporations, which place orders for goods to be supplied on credit,
to meet their obligations, on time or at all.
So to mitigate the risk of the corporate
purchaser not paying its bills, the supplier can take out credit insurance:
indeed without such cover, the supplier is less likely to provide the goods
needed by the larger corporation creating a dangerous situation that can
cause the collapse of the larger corporations themselves. In other words,
the supply chain and distribution systems are creaking and showing early
signs of a potential to seize up.
On 29th November, the insurance group Amlin,
which is estimated to own about 4% of the UK credit insurance market, was
reported likewise to be pulling out of the credit insurance market, having
reportedly decided not to write any new policies for businesses supplying
goods to other businesses on credit.
These insurance firms are clearly anticipating increased losses from
payouts. Atradius is said to be aiming to reduce its overall exposure to
risk in the United Kingdom by about 7%, compared with a projected 5%
reduction of its exposures to the business credit market in the rest of the
world.
However should the gradient of the economic
downturn continue to steepen at its present rate, pointing straight into a
depression, thanks to the ongoing criminal sabotage, we would expect such
credit risk exposures to be cut back much more sharply after the turn of the
year.
-
The above observations were prepared on
30th November. On 2nd December, Alan Duncan, the Shadow Business
Secretary ('Conservative' Party), authored an article in The
Financial Times in which, in true socialist fashion, he called for
the state to underwrite 'vital insurance cover to stop the credit
crunch [sic] precipitating the collapse of supply chains'.
BRITAIN AND AMERICA ON
THE BRINK OF A DEPRESSION
Which brings us to a pressingly critical point. Thanks to the criminal
activities of the holders of the highest offices in the United States,
Britain and Germany, to name the very worst offenders, both the United
States and Britain are now hovering on the brink of a real DEPRESSION, with
General Motors effectively bankrupt in the United States and numerous
corporations and well-known names such as Woolworths in the United Kingdom
going to the wall in a frenetic cascade that is being accompanied by
steepening declines in consumer confidence and purchases in recent weeks.
Paul Volcker, who will certainly serve as Mr Obamas most prestigious
economic adviser beyond the special role that he has accepted, told a
conference convened by Lombard Street Research in London on 17th November
that the economic slump has begun to spread after a shocking collapse in
output over the two months to mid-November, threatening to overwhelm the
incoming Obama Administration as it struggles to restore confidence.
What this crisis reveals, Mr Volcker said,
is a broken financial system like no other in my lifetime. Normal
monetary policy is not able to get money flowing. The trouble is that,
even with all this [government] protection [sic], the market is not
moving again.
In an appropriate oblique criticism of his
successor as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the criminal operative,
arrested in June 2007, Dr Alan Greenspan, Mr Volcker elaborated that,
there has been leveraging in the economy
beyond imagination, and nobody [at the time] was saying we need to do
something.
Mr Volcker also blamed what he called the new
means of credit alchemy that led bankers to slice and dice mortgage debt
into packages that disguised risk.
THE DERIVATIVES CRISIS
= THE FRAUDULENT FINANCE CRISIS
Actually, none of the downstream slicers and dicers, including Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, had or have any recourse to the sole source of funds,
namely the mortgager.
The ONLY party with true recourse is the original
mortgage bank.
Therefore, ALL downstream, repackaged, collectivized, securitized
so-called derivative assets are fraudulent and are worth zero, a fact of
life recognized by the regional Federal Reserve Banks, we understand, and
which is a source of tension between them and the Federal Reserve Board and
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
In our forthcoming paper on this subject, we will provide further proof that
the derivatives are all worth zero, which is the CENTRAL ISSUE. The only
authoritative (that is, internationally approved) derivatives aggregate data
are the numbers published by the Bank for International Settlements,
reproduced and elaborated by the International Monetary Fund, for instance
in its October 2008 Global Financial Stability Report subtitled Financial
Stress and Deleveraging: Macrofinancial Implications and Policy, made
available in the Press Room at the IMF/World Bank Group Annual meetings held
in October in Washington DC.
Both sources adjust the data, on an estimated basis, for double-counting
(2). According to these sources, the notional value of outstanding adjusted
global over-the-counter derivatives contracts had expanded from $257,894
billion at the end of 2004, to $596,004 billion by the end of December 2007.
The most recent figure cited (applicable to around mid-October 2008) was
$667 trillion.
But the underlying gross market values of these outstanding contracts rose
from just $9,377 billion at the end of December 2004, to $14,522 billion by
the end of 2007.
Thus, whereas the gross market values of outstanding contracts were worth
3.6% of their notional values at the end of 2004, the equivalent proportion
three years later was 2.4%.
But such assessments are in fact meaningless because, as noted above, these
exotic 'derived' instruments are, by definition, marketed WITHOUT RECOURSE
to the underlying source of real funds, which means that the derived
assets are fundamentally fraudulent.
If the mortgager does default, the only party that can ever know about the
default is the original mortgage bank. The 'downstream' parties never get to
know about it, and AREN'T INTERESTED.
It used to be the case that maximum derivatives leveraging possible in the
United Kingdom was 10:1. Earlier this year, leveraging operations of 30:1
were being reported from London, and the large US financial criminal
enterprises are believed until recently, at least, to have favored mad
leveraging ratios as extended as 40:1.
This would theoretically enable Citibank, for instance, to convert $306
billion in quick succession to $12,240 billion.
However all such proceeds would have to be
stashed away off-balance sheet, are adjudged now to be dubious, and cannot
be surreptitiously transferred onto the balance sheet, under the Basel-II
settlement, given the necessity for the disclosure of source of funds and
the crucial, little-mentioned, factor that auditors fears of being sued for
misrepresentation, and more generally for their own survival given what has
happened to some of their peers, mean that they are no longer susceptible to
condoning smoke and mirrors treatments of clients' accounts.
BUSH PEOPLE STILL
PUSHING FRAUDULENT FINANCE TRADES
In the face of the reality that the perpetrators of these fraudulent finance
operations have been found out, it is STILL the case that Bush Sr. and his
few remaining cronies have been continuing, or attempting to persist with,
business as usual, looking for counterparties for exotic trades.
Most such prospective parties have long since realized that Bush-linked
associates are criminal operatives: so, as indicated, searching for
counterparties, even in Dubai which is now in financial trouble, has been
proving a problem. The fact that these people are STILL persisting with this
behavior shows how brainlessly bovine and set in their criminal ways they
remain.
One of the lessons that astute counterparties around the world will or ought
to have learned by now is that the Bush-linked criminal Octopus, being by
far the most ruthless and reckless cabal of criminal financial operatives in
human history, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, turns on their collaborators on the basis of
the standard, crude bait and switch double-cross technique that they were
taught at intelligence school. That was what happened, of course, with Iraq.
But although we have publicized the fact that one purpose of the invasion of
Iraq was to ransack the Central Bank of Iraq, steal its gold, currency and
other assets and acquire control over Rafidain Bank and thus over its
sub-accounts in London, believed to hold fiat assets worth an estimated $100
trillion, the deeper reason for the second invasion has not hitherto been
divulged.
THE U.S. TREASURY
PLATES SHIPPED TO THE USSR IN 1944
Some time in 1944, a US aircraft supposedly (but see below) crashed in
Siberia.
A certain Soviet KGB officer operating in the United States, one
Colonel Kotikov, referred to this aircraft within the hearing of at least
one US military officer, as the money plane.
When questioned by the US officer as to the
meaning of the phrase the money plane, Colonel Kotikov explained that the
US Treasury was shipping engraved printing plates and related banknote
printing materials to the Soviets so that they could start to print the same
occupation money for distribution in occupied Germany as the United States
was printing for the same purpose.
As a Master Printer (because we own a small printing works), the Editor of
this service knows only too well that there is ONE cast-iron rule in the
printing trade: NEVER release the printing plates.
They are tools of the trade and represent components that have to be
manufactured in order to print the copies, which is what the customer buys.
The customer does not purchase the tools from which the copies were
manufactured: just the copies.
What the US Treasury SHOULD have done was to
print German occupation money for the Soviets, and ship them the currency
itself.
But unbelievably, the US Treasury shipped not
only the engraved printing plates, but also colored inks, varnish, tint
blocks, sample paper and other components, in two shipments conveyed to the
USSR via five C-47s. The shipments were arranged at the highest level in
Washington, DC, with the planes loaded up at National Airport.
The Soviets then proceeded to print the new marks that their part of
occupied Germany needed, which the United States redeemed, with no
accountability whatsoever, to the gross amount of $250 million, a colossal
sum in those days.
The Soviet official who had repeatedly agitated for the US authorities to
send Treasury printing plates to Moscow, was Andrei Gromyko (Katz), who was
then Soviet Ambassador to Washington. If Washington had meant to wage
economic warfare (possibly by supplying the Soviets with slightly doctored
printing plates so that Soviet print runs could be distinguished from the
equivalent mark notes printed by or for the US Military Administration),
this operation appears to have backfired.
Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) maintained unhealthily close links at the
very heart of the US Government of the day, via Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter
White. A published US Department of State Memorandum dated 14th April 1944
of a telephone conversation between Henry Morgenthau, the US Treasury
Secretary and a Mr James Clement Dunn, of the State Department, entitled
Duplicate plates to be furnished to the Soviet Union indicated that the
five C-47s finally left National Airport on 24th May 1944. Mr Gromyko even
demanded a replacement consignment, after one of the planes had crashed (see
above); and the US authorities never queried his information, sending a
plane with a replacement consignment of printing plates and materials to
the USSR on 7th June 1944.
In this episode, Gromyko had insisted on obtaining US Treasury printing
plates so that the Soviets could print German occupation currency without
accountability, because the Soviets knew that the US Army would convert such
currency into US dollars (whereas the Russians, of course, refused to redeem
the same currency with rubles).
As a consequence, every Russian mark that fell into the hands of an American
soldier or accredited civilian became a potential charge against the
Treasury of the United States.
Using the materials provided by Washington, the
Russians confiscated an erstwhile Nazi printing plant in Leipzig, deep
inside the Russian Zone and therefore at a safe distance from American
inspection, and started up the machinery. By December 1946, the US Military
Government had found that it had redeemed US dollars to the value of at
least 2,500,000,000 marks in excess of the total value of occupation marks
issued by its Finance Office.
Oh, and the Soviets never paid an invoice for
$18,102.84 rendered by the US Treasury to cover the cost of the engraving
plates and the materials delivered in 1944.
PRECEDENT SET FOR U.S.
PLATES DELIVERED BY BUSH TO SADDAM
Why have we apparently diverged with this historical account of how the
Soviets bilked the United States for $250 million in 1944-46? Because a
similar operation was apparently perpetrated in Iraq. Only this time round,
engraved printing plates were reportedly made available to Saddam Hussein by
George H. W. Bush Sr., the arrogant, criminal representative of the DVD who
thought he was so powerful that, as late as around 2004, he could even tell
members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to go take a flying [expletive
deleted] at the moon.
If the motive for delivering US Treasury printing plates (whether officially
authorized or not) to the Iraqi régime of Saddam Hussein in any way
replicated the pattern of the 1944-46 scamming ruse, the objective
underlying this treachery will have been to impose a drain on the US
Treasury through the redemption of Iraqi dinars into US dollars, which could
then be pocketed by US operatives.
It is suspected, therefore, that among the cynical Black motives for the
invasion of Iraq, and the consequent murder and displacement of around
2,000,000 people, not to mention the thousands of US and Allied military
personnel and those 100+ 'special operatives' who raided the Central Bank of
Iraq and were then grouped together so as to be deliberately bombarded by
deadly US weaponry in a contrived 'friendly fire' operation, will have been
the familiar one, repeated in other contexts in this murky background, of
protecting the part of criminal DVD operative George Bush Sr.s anatomy that
he uses for sitting upon.
Bush's 'rogue' US monetary printing plates had
to be retrieved.
POSTCRIPT
ATTEMPT TO INSTALL A
CAMERA OUTSIDE OUR OFFICE EXPOSED
On Tuesday 11th November, a visitor to the Editors London office noticed
that a camera, sprouting several antennae, had been erected on a tall street
lighting lamp post located immediately opposite our office building.
Earlier, when the Editor had left the building to run certain errands in
Victoria Street, he had noticed at least half a dozen men and two big
Westminster City Council vehicles, one with a hydraulic lift, parked
adjacent to the lamp post, engaged in complex activity focused upon the
street lighting.
The Editor deliberately reported this matter
later via our monitored telephone lines and then, with his visitor, stood
outside in the pavement looking at the camera from various angles, before we
repaired to a nearby hostelry for some refreshments.
-
The camera remained in situ, as viewed
from the upper storeys of our building, as late as midnight that
evening. By 9.15am the following morning, it had been removed.
On Wednesday 12th November, the Editor began a
series of telephone calls to Westminster City Council, with a view to
obtaining some explanation for the erection and overnight removal of the
camera and antennae overlooking our office.
After innumerable attempts to
extract a coherent explanation, and having left various voicemail messages
expressing our dismay at this behavior, the Editor finally had to inform
the Personal Assistant to the Chief Executive of Westminster City Council,
asking for an urgent response.
Whereupon he was inundated with responses,
culminating in the following explanation by Patrick Allen, a senior Council
executive (paraphrase) in answer to our questions: Who authorized the
camera? What was its purpose? What budget financed it?:
We are testing equipment. The major
supplier, British Telecom Plc, is late with its deliveries of hardware.
But the lesser suppliers have delivered in accordance with their
contracts and have submitted their invoices and want to be paid. The
intended system cannot be installed until the British Telecom equipment
has been supplied. So we have been testing the equipment provided by the
smaller suppliers, to verify that it is fit for purpose. The crew would
have erected the camera to test it and would then have removed it once
the test was complete.
In answer to the comment that the camera was
mysteriously removed overnight, Mr Allen said:
Thats quite possible. The crews start at
7.00am in the morning.
Who are we to argue with this very rapidly
provided official explanation for the fact that a camera, complete with
numerous antennae, was suddenly erected and focused at our office building
and then abruptly removed overnight, after we had reported this matter by
telephone and indicated our curiosity by being photographed looking at the
camera from all angles in the street?
APPENDIX
THE EARLY ATTEMPT BY THE DVD-ORIENTED COMPONENT OF
MI6 TO PUT A STOP TO THE EDITORS INVESTIGATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL
CORRUPTION. IT HAD THE REVERSE EFFECT:
The following sequence, published on pages F-05 to F-08 of International
Currency Review, Volume 34, #1, distributed worldwide at the end of
November 2008, references conversations between the veteran journalist,
Gordon Thomas, who boasted of close intelligence connections, and the
Editor of this service, in 2004-2005, in which Gordon Thomas warned or
threatened the Editor that certain elements ostensibly of UK
intelligence had borne false witness against the Editor of this service
by disseminating fatuous fabrications about the Editors supposed links
to Mark Thatcher and Bernie Ecclestone, neither of whom the Editor has
ever met and with whom he has never had anything to do, not least
because your very own correspondent has done nothing at all in his
working life since returning from Canada in 1961 except write and
publish, and provide consultancy services, on his own account.
This is a full-time 24/7 occupation which
allows of no respite, especially as nowadays we also publish (and the
Editor writes) books.
However given the huge momentum of the
exposures, which have 'blown' this fraudulent finance and the
involvement of criminal enterprise institutions and intelligence cadres
in its perpetration, while exposing the roles of DVD, Dachau, CIA-1,
Frankfurt, Government Operations 2 (GO-2), DVD chieftain George Bush
Sr. and the other criminal elements who have been disturbing the peace
of humanity and creating flashpoints around the world (such as in
Bombay) to cover up their financial crimes, it would appear that
elements of British intelligence later changed their opinion of what the
Editor was attempting to achieve. At all events, their early
intimidation operation fell flat.
This demonstrates the wisdom, perhaps, of walking in a straight line
when investigating and exposing evil, since parties who zigzag cannot
keep up with those who forge straight ahead.
The relevant passages from the latest issue of our financial journal,
referencing conversations with Gordon Thomas, are as follows:
In the course of the conversation [in
Bath, on that occasion], the question of MI6 and British
intelligence interest in certain topics arose. It was in this
context that the veteran journalist revealed that MI6 had informed
him personally that your correspondent is or was involved with Mark
Thatcher in connection with the botched coup to seize power and the
oil assets in Equatorial Guinea. Observing Thomass own astonishment
at this curious invention, your correspondent asked when he had
heard this nonsense about [my non-existent connection with] Mark
Thatcher.
At first he said that oh, it was very recent, within the past two
months. (However in a telephone conversation on 19th November 2004,
Gordon Thomas, who has close MI6 connections, shortened this
time-frame to within the past two weeks, before correcting himself
and saying that it may have been within the past two months. A bit
hazy, he was).
Mr Thomas elaborated that his MI6 source(s)
had reacted as follows when the Editors name had come up in
conversation: Oh yes, we know about him. Why revive him?
We take this to be a reference to the fact that the Editor had published
his early findings about this corruption in Volume 28, Number 4 of this
service, back in March 2003. That issue alluded to, and illustrated some
of, the smoking gun financial payout documents made available to the
Editor in June 2002. In other words, MI6 thought we had fallen asleep.
Separately, a Pentagon-linked operative had approached the Editor about
some scam involving Bernie Ecclestone, a character with a murky
background, explaining that he had been told (by MI6, it transpired)
that the Editor had some involvement with this motor racing fellow, also
a pack of lies. Both the Ecclestone and Thatcher fables were
'supposedly' fabricated by MI6.
GORDON THOMAS SPILLS THE BEANS
On later telephoning Gordon Thomas, in order to thank him for his time
and hospitality on the preceding afternoon, your correspondent made his
deduction of the link clear to him:
Editor: Its obvious that this mad
fantasy about links with Mark Thatcher and the separate nonsense
about Bernie Ecclestone comes from the same source, namely MI6.
Gordon Thomas (as though he knew more than he was revealing):
Thats right.
Editor: Who did you obtain this [Mark Thatcher libel] tripe from:
were they high-up sources?
Gordon Thomas: I heard this very recently
.Yes, one of them is [a
high-up source]'.
I would describe the other as middle management.
Editor: So what makes them do something like this? What drives them
to make up such ludicrous stories and lies, when they know they
cant make anything stick (since the whole pack of lies is a crude
and clumsy invention)?
Gordon Thomas: [paraphrase]: Its not necessary for them to prove
anything. All they need to do is to make allegations. Thats all
they need to do.
Editor: So, what have they done with these lies?
Have they put these inventions out there to the press?
Gordon Thomas: Yes, its with the press, I understand.
Gordon Thomas then proceeded in general terms to
summarize the false
story that MI6 had fed to the press about the Editors alleged (but
totally non-existent) connections with Mark Thatcher and the failed
Equatorial Guinea fiasco.
In other words, MI6 were attempting to
connect the Editor to this episode, of which of course the Editor
know absolutely nothing except what we have read in the open press
and on the Internet.
Editor: Of course if any such allegations were to appear in print I
would go to court at once. Presumably they realize that.
The Editor reiterated that if any such false
allegations were to be made in the press, he would go to court given
that the suggestions are fabrications with no basis whatsoever in the
real world. The Editor spends all of his time (24/7) preparing serials
and books for publication; and as all who know him are aware, has no
time for any other work activity of any kind, as has been the case since
1969.
Gordon Thomas then alluded to the fact that the newspapers concerned
would have done their homework and would find that they could make no
progress since there would be no connections to be unraveled; whereupon
he said that it would not have been necessary for there to have been any
substance to MI6s lies: all that would be necessary to discredit the
Editor in the eyes of the media would be to put this pack of lies out
there.
FALSE WITNESS LIES, SO THAT THE MAINSTREAM
WOULD IGNORE IT
The motive would have been to guarantee that if International Currency
Review were ever to publish any information which might reveal serial
official corruption on either side of the Atlantic or anywhere else, the
British press would pay no attention (as has hitherto been the case). It
was a classic intelligence frame-up.
In further conversation between the Editor and the veteran journalist,
Gordon Thomas, it was carefully explained to the Editor that
[paraphrase]:
-
British and American intelligence are
now so incestuously intertwined, and the foreign policy stances of
the two Governments ditto, that there is hardly any difference
between them.
-
(No mention of DVD and Mossad, you
notice: Ed.).
-
A new second-term Bush Administration
had been elected on 2nd November and was anxious that ALL its
requirements across the board would be complied with by the British
authorities, as appropriate, in line with its familiar arrogant
approach to the Special Relationship.
[In the same issue, on pages 41-58, we demonstrated conclusively
that the 2004 election, like the election of 2000, was stolen, and
we showed in part how this was done].
-
It had been explained to the veteran
journalist, Gordon Thomas, by MI6, that Washington had basically
been pressurizing them to do something about Mr Story. When your
correspondent asked why on earth this was considered necessary,
the veteran journalist continued [paraphrase]:
-
They think you may be dangerous*
because you have the documents and you have control of publications
through which information about the financial documents can be
disseminated.
[*Dangerous for what reason? Because we
would be liable to expose their nasty corruption, their double-dealing,
their open-ended abuse of power, and their treason, by any chance?]
Editor: But they know perfectly well
that others have these compromising financial documents
. [The
Editor then mentioned his knowledge that the editor of a prominent
publication (Vanity Fair) held copies of the documents in the folder
obtained by the Editor in Washington in June 2002].
Gordon Thomas: Yes, but he probably cant use them, or else is too
frightened to do so (accurate: Editor), whereas you can, because the
publications you publish are under your direct control.
Editor: So you are saying that MI6 know that there isnt a
controlling intelligence cell sitting in our press room, as is the
case elsewhere, and are collaborating with the crude Forces of
Darkness in Washington who want these financial scandals to remain
covered up indefinitely, are you?
Gordon Thomas: In so many words, thats what is intended, yes. And
heres what they said. They said: Tell Mr Story about what has
happened to [adding the name of a well-known UK journalist who
stepped out of line. The name of this journalist is known to the
Editor]. This was a threat to surface some wholly concocted
sleaze report about the Editor.
Gordon Thomas then explained that his MI6
contact(s) referred to photographs of this journalist stripped naked and
indulging in some kind of satanic sexual orgy.
He then added:
They are
saying that if you expose these documents, or if they think you are
going to do so, they will do everything in their power to discredit you.
That way, when you publicize the damning information that you possess,
no-one will believe you and the press will take no notice. ATTEMPTED
BLACKMAIL.
The second part of prediction has proved accurate. The press took no
notice: but not because of the lies peddled by the criminal organization
calling itself MI6 (or was Gordon Thomas speaking on behalf of Mossad by
any chance?), but actually because the mainstream media didnt keep up
with events, didnt do its due diligence, and was all too easily
bamboozled by the spooks who fed them redirection slides about the
cause of the problem being sub-prime mortgages, which have of course
existed ever since mortgages were first thought of. The mainstream
bought this bromide, and went to sleep for a year.
Consequently, the UK mainstream media, found wanting and caught short,
have since been scrambling to catch up with the unraveling Octopus
scandal, with no reliable bearings to guide them.
We cannot tell whether
or not they ignored the evidence we have published since March 2003, on
the basis (according to Gordon Thomass assessment) of a farrago of
concocted rubbish about the Editor which has never even surfaced,
despite these threats.
They did not even amount to blackmail, because
there was nothing in the lies to blackmail the Editor with. However
Gordon Thomas behaved disgracefully in allowing himself to be used for
this low purpose. Shame on you.
Naturally, the Editor exposed this clumsy attempted frame-up by
publishing the complete narrative (on pages 27-39 of Volume 30, Numbers
2 & 3 [known as The Green Book)].
The BLACKMAIL AND FALSE WITNESS warning sequence is concluded:
Editor: This is all going rather
further than the previous baseless allegations. Those were so absurd
as to be almost demented: anyone who knows me is aware that I do
nothing else, 24/7, but prepare our publications for press.
How
could I have time to mess about with this fellow Bernie Ecclestone,
whom I have never met and would never wish to meet, in Monte Carlo,
fooling around with motor cars which I know nothing at all about and
in which I have never been interested; or with Mark Thatcher, whom I
have never met or spoken to either, in some dark corner of Africa?
When would I have time to do any of that, and why do they think I
am so pushed for money that I would be tempted by such stupidity? In
any case I never invest in anyone elses ventures: only in my own,
not least because I have no time for any other activity.
If these
stupid idiots had done their homework, they would know this: after
all, I have been doing precisely the same thing since the 1960s, and
our financial publications are well known in the global banking
sector after all these decades. Furthermore our London offices are
only round the corner: these people have feet.
They can walk
.
Gordon Thomas: Oh they wouldnt do that. Theyd have your
telephones bugged. They listen to your phone calls. Why would they
expose themselves? They want to expose you.
Editor [thinking: Well, they have just exposed themselves, through
you, Mister]:
If they are so very desperate, why dont they liquidate me, like
they have liquidated others, this being evidently one of their
favourite pastimes? If they think I am so likely to expose their
corruption, why dont they just do that?
Gordon Thomas: Oh, they wouldnt do that. it would be far too
messy.
Editor: (unspoken): Oh, so the only reason they wouldnt do that
is that it would be far too messy. So, if it wasnt far too messy,
they would, would they?
They made a pretty messy job of poor Dr
Kelly [the British microbiologist who, like more than 300 of his
scientific colleagues around the world, have died mysteriously and
violently in recent years because of their knowledge of secret
population-reduction biological warfare technology that is being
developed in order to rid the world, Himmler-style, of
undesirables, and in Dr Kellys case, almost certainly because he
knew about the clandestine operation orchestrated by the Bush/DVD
apparat to equip Iran with nuclear materials.
Dr Kelly was found
suicided in an Oxfordshire wood in 2003. His body was moved and
the related cover-up appears to be unraveling right now, along with
everything else.
[INSERTION: It is believed that the
triple gunshot warning that the Editor received in September 2008 [see
Report, 21st September 2008] reflected a belief that we might reveal
information about delivery of such materials, along with little girls,
drugs and arms, using DVD-supplied submarines].
Editor: (spoken: paraphrase): In
revealing their dirty little hands like this, they are exposing
themselves, which strikes me as being extremely dumb of them. They
have shown their hand, thereby indicating to me that any exposure of
these evils is indeed greatly to be feared, which signals to me loud
and clear that it is all the more urgently necessary.
Anyway, as a direct consequence of this clumsy early 'MI6'
(according to Gordon Thomas: but was it?) intervention, the Editor
was further encouraged to continue his enquiries.
The correct way to
have dealt with their little problem would have been for someone
from the intelligence services to have made an appointment to come
to the Editors office across the River Thames, and to have appealed
to the Editor on the basis of the old standards of gentlemanly
honor.
Sorry, we forgot: these people arent
gentlemen any longer. So they blow their cover, instead.

MISPRISION OF FELONY: U.S. CODE, TITLE
18, PART 1, CHAPTER 1, SECTION 4:
-
Whoever, having knowledge of the
actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United
States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the
same to some Judge or other person in civil or military authority
under the United States, shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

The derivatives data published by the
Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary
Fund are, as the IMF states in its Global Financial Stability
Report, all adjusted for double-counting. Specifically, notional
amounts cited were adjusted by halving positions vis-à-vis other
reporting dealers.
This means that, taking the mid-October
notional value of derivatives contracts outstanding calculated on
this basis of $667 trillion, the unadjusted figure would be $1,334
trillion very close to the figure that we have published in
International Currency Review and in Economic Intelligence Review.
Gross market values were calculated as the sum of the total gross
positive market value of contracts and the absolute value of the
gross negative market value of contracts with non-reporting
counterparties.

The observations about Gordon Browns
possible origins extracted below from our report dated 18th June
2008 [see the Archive], which are also published on page 123 of
International Currency Review, Volume 34, #1, distributed at the end
of November 2008, are pertinent in this context.
They immediately followed our paragraph
about Brown travelling to Belfast to join President Bush and his
wife again in the afternoon of the same day that he had already said
goodbye to them in front of the TV cameras on the steps of Downing
Street that same morning:
-
The Editor was most interested to
observe, on page W2 of the Weekend section of The Daily
Telegraph of Saturday, 14th June 2008, in a feature celebrating
Fathers Day, which the British have never previously bothered
with, a segment about Gordon Brown and his father. This showed a
photograph of Mr Browns alleged father John standing in front
of an old-style car in a traditional farmyard, with two small
boys. The caption reads: Moral compass: Gordon Brown (above
left) at the age of two, with his father John and elder brother,
John Junior.
The images of the two little boys had
clearly been cut out and then stuck onto the old background photograph.
When such montages were made (using old technology), the lighting was
liable to cast a dark shadow at some edges of the images stuck onto the
background, given that the light casts a shadow round the raised edges
in question.
This was clearly a doctored montage, as can be seen from the hard black
edge around the left-hand side of the older boys face, his right thigh
and his left shoulder, and the parallel hard (black) edge around the
right ear of Gordon and along his left shoulder and arm. This new
discovery confirms the Editors long-held suspicion that the received
legend associated with the intelligence officer Gordon Brown may be
misleading.
There are also similar indications that the father figure in this
picture may likewise have been mounted onto this rural background image.
If these observations are anywhere close to being accurate, there is no
difference between Britain these days and the former Soviet Union,
which was adept at falsifying photographs in order to sustain false
legends or to reflect liquidations of key personnel. Furthermore, it
may be usefully noted that Gordon Browns age corresponds to the
timeframe of the Hungarian uprising in 1956.
It is therefore speculated that Brown may be of Hungarian, possibly
Ashkenazi Jewish, extraction, and may have been a '1956' refugee baby
brought to Britain during the Hungarian uprising period.
This analysis
is purely speculative and cannot be claimed to be authoritative.
