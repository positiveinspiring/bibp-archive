The Age of Enlightenment was born sometime around the beginning of the
eighteenth century.
A mere three-quarters of a century later,
industrialization ushered in the Age of Endarkenment, and human life
has grown more and more perilous ever since. The Golden Age of capitalism
cannot be recreated merely by applying the right mixture of spending,
subsidies, re-regulation, and international agreements. Because the economic
advantages of industrialization rely on overproduction and profit, balanced
trade is impossible if the advantage is to be preserved; it entails no
economic profit.
Industrialism is a Hegelian synthesis which
embodies the forces for its own destruction. The greatest threat to the
Western Way of Life is the Western Way of Life itself.
That human beings seem unable to solve their most pressing problems is too
obvious and well known to deserve much mention; that most of the problems
that human beings seem unable to solve are caused by human beings themselves
deserves mention but rarely is.
Human beings act as though having to deal with problems whose causes are
beyond human control is not enough. Cyclones, earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, droughts, floods are apparently not serious enough to command
human attention. These problems, apparently, have to be supplemented by
self-made catastrophes to keep our minds engaged.
But most manmade problems could be avoided by
careful and complete analysis of the ideas that, when implemented, have dire
results.
Time-tested and effective ways of analyzing problems have been known for
centuries. Rene Descartes published his Rules for the Direction of the Mind
around 1627 and the Discourse on Method in 1637.
John Stuart Mill published his Methods
in his System of Logic in 1843. The mathematical method known as
reductio ad absurdum has been employed throughout the history of
mathematics and philosophy from classical antiquity onwards, as has the
method known as counterexample. And root cause analysis is a highly
developed method often used in information science and other places.
Oddly enough, however, even most well educated
Americans seem to be unaware of any of these analytical techniques, and when
attempts are made to analyze ideas, these attempts are rarely carried out
logically or all the way to their ultimate ends. Americans rarely "follow
the argument wherever it leads;" even those good at analysis often stop when
they come across something that looks appealing.
John B. Judis recently
published a piece in the New Republic in which
he summarized some claims made by Robert Brenner, a UCLA economic historian.
Judis writes:
"Brenners analysis of the current downturn
can be boiled down to a fairly simple point: that the underlying cause
of the current downturn lies in the real economy of private goods and
service production rather than in the financial sector, and that the
current remedies - from government spending and tax cuts to financial
regulation - will not lead to the kind of robust growth and employment
that the United States enjoyed after World War II and fleetingly in the
late 1990s.
These remedies wont succeed because they
wont get at what has caused the slowdown in the real economy: global
overcapacity in tradeable (sic) goods production. Global overcapacity
means that the worlds industries are capable of producing far more
steel, shoes, cell phones, computer chips, and automobiles (among other
things) than the worlds consumers are able and willing to consume."
Why this is worth mentioning is difficult to
fathom.
Overproduction has always been associated with
economic busts, and such busts have happened with such regularity that
economists have even incorporated them into theory by euphemistically
calling booms and busts the "business cycle."
The question that must be asked is,
"What causes
overproduction?"
And the answer is industrialization.
The Industrial Revolution began in England around 1780. It transformed
England from a manual labour and draft-animal economy into a machine-based
one. But this change in the primary mode of economic activity was not merely
economic; it changed the entire culture, not clearly for the better. Almost
every aspect of life was changed in some way.
Many cite increased per capita GDP as evidence of the revolution's benefits,
but GDP is a poor measure of benefits. It merely measures the sum total of
economic transactions in terms of the culture's money, neglecting the
effects of economic activity on the quality of human life.
The Industrial Revolution is largely responsible for the rise of modern
cities, as large numbers of people migrated to them in search of jobs. These
people were mainly housed in slums where diseases, especially cholera,
typhoid, tuberculosis, and smallpox, were spread by contaminated water and
other means. Respiratory diseases contracted by miners became common.
Accidents in factories were regular. In 1788,
two-thirds of the workers in cotton mills were children; they were also
employed in coal mines. Henry Phelps Brown and Sheila V. Hopkins argue that
the bulk of the population suffered severe reductions in their living
standards. Although life in pre-industrial England was not easy, for many it
was better than laboring in factories and coal mines.
Other consequences of the revolution are worse - craft workers lost their
jobs. The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories,
and mines, but industrial workers could never experience the sense of
satisfaction and pride that craftsmen derived from their creations. Working
a craft is a mentally stimulating and creative activity; operating a machine
is not.
The best craftsmen were renowned as artists.
Some are still renowned today: Thomas Chippendale and George Hepplewhite,
for example.
The integral strength of Windsor chairs has
never been duplicated in a factory. Handmade textiles, Persian rugs, even
handcrafted toys are renowned for their artistry. Today that pride and
satisfaction accrues only to hobbyists, such as quilters, but never to
industrial workers. The Industrial Revolution degraded human life to the
status of coal.
People became fuel for machines. Bought cheap,
people are used until unneeded and then discarded like slag. Individuality,
talent, imagination, originality - the best attributes of human beings - are
suppressed to the point of extinction. The Industrial Revolution sucked the
humanity out of the human race; people became things.
But the revolution gave England a temporary economic advantage as that is
measured by economists. Excess production, that is, production not consumed
domestically, could be exported, and England's wealth could be increased by
buying (importing) cheap and selling (exporting) dear. This worked - for a
while, but never smoothly.
The Industrial Revolution quickly spread to Belgium, France, the United
States, Japan, the Alpine countries, Italy, and other places.
As it spread, the amount of excess products that
needed to be exported grew and grew, and the number prospective foreign
consumers shrank and shrank. Because there is little economic advantage (as
economists measure it) in trading exports for imports of equal value, the
international economy necessarily divides into net exporting nations who are
enriched and net importing countries who are impoverished and less and less
able to afford imports.
The system has to be patched or the machines
would grind to a halt. Most of the work of economists since the middle of
the nineteenth century consists of developing patches for this collapsing
system. Comparative advantage, creative destruction, free trade, Keynesian
stimuli, and even social programs (which would be unnecessary if the economy
provided for the needs of people) are merely attempts to patch the system,
to keep the machines running.
Industrialists soon realized that if they reduced the quality of their
products, their life cycles would be shortened which would require people to
replace them more often thereby increasing consumption.
Manufacturers have been steadily reducing the
quality of products ever since. An essential part in a device is made of an
inferior material so the device fails far before its time and becomes junk,
batteries in devices are soldered to their circuit boards so that when the
batteries die, the products becomes junk, one fewer olive in every jar means
more jars are sold, and the jars become junk. Economists like to claim that
the system produces the best products at the lowest cost, but in reality it
produces the exact opposite.
As more and more products must be discarded and
replaced, the discarded junk is hauled to landfills or dumped in oceans. But
as landfills grow larger and larger, another patch is required - recycling.
But it too is ineffective. Batteries soldered to circuit boards cannot be
recycled, every half-filled can of paint cannot be taken to a recycling
center, separating useful elements from the useless ones is often a
hazardous task.
The system produces junk!
Humans originated
about 200,000 years ago. The Soviet Union launched the first Sputnik into
space in 1957. In less than 60 years, less than a mere three tenths of one
percent of the time people have inhabited the Earth, the industrial nations
have put so much junk into near outer space that the junk now endangers the
functionality of operational satellites.
Abandoned industrial sites are often highly
toxic which often require cleanup - another patch. Often complete cleanup is
impossible. Toxic residues are a species of junk. Keeping the machines
running necessitates the production of it.
Global industrial capitalism will continue on the gradual downward descent
to collapse. The Golden Age of industrial capitalism that lasted from 1945
to 1970 cannot be recreated merely by applying the right mixture of
spending, subsidies, re-regulation, and international agreements. Because
the economic advantages of industrialization rely on the two ingredients
mentioned above, overproduction and profit, balanced trade is impossible if
the advantage is to be preserved; it entails no economic profit.
Ultimately too many nations will be too poor to
be importers, and the machines in the exporting countries will cease to
function.
Industrialism is a Hegelian synthesis which
embodies the forces for its own destruction. The greatest threat to the Western Way of Life is the Western Way of Life itself.
Patches may prolong
it, but they cannot remove its contradictions.
Chandran Nair
writes,
The 20th centurys triumph of
consumption-based capitalism has created the crisis of the 21st century:
looming catastrophic climate change, massive environmental damage and
significant depletion of natural resources... The western economic
model, which defines success as consumption-driven growth, must be
challenged... Advocates of the western model tend to play down its
dramatic effects on natural resources and the environment.
They refuse to acknowledge that their advice
runs counter to scientific consensus about limits and the need for
stringent rules on resource management. Instead, they argue that human
ingenuity aided by innovations in the markets will find solutions.
This
is rooted in an irrational belief that we can have everything:
ever-growing material wealth and a healthy natural environment. The
stark evidence... should be proof enough that this is not possible.
No, it's not possible, but the impossibility
lies in the system's logic, not in its effects.
To use the preferred diction of economists, the
system is unsustainable. Since the collapse of the industrial system is
inevitable, a fundamental rethinking of the way the economy works is the
only alternative. It has always been the only alternative.
But even that leaves humanity soaking in the
pickle. When the economic advantages of industrialization have dissipated,
humanity will still be stuck in a world filled with bioundegradable junk,
hazardous sites, raped environments, the unending consequences of the often
accidental importation of alien species, polluted air and water, and
numerous other consequences, the costs of which economists have never taken
into consideration.
And the progeny of both the rich and the poor alike will
have to live with them.
The pockets full of money that the rich have
won't prevent their children and grandchildren from breathing bad air or
drinking bad water or dealing with environmental degradation. These children
and grandchildren may someday curse the days their fathers and grandfathers
were born. Capitalism, as we know it, is reaching its
endgame.
The meek who inherit the earth will find it to
be worthless.
The human brain has enabled mankind to discover and create wondrous things;
it has also been used to inflict horrendous suffering and destruction. In
fact, it would be difficult to design an economic system more destructive,
wasteful, and dehumanizing than the industrial, and much of the destruction
it has wrought may be irreparable.
Industrialization does not efficiently allocate
resources; it squanders them.
So, is mankind smart? Of course, but that is not the question.
The ultimate
question is,
Is mankind smart enough to keep from outsmarting itself?
The
answer appears to be no!
The Age of Enlightenment was born sometime around the beginning of the
eighteenth century. A mere three-quarters of a century later,
industrialization ushered in the Age of Endarkenment, and human life
has grown more and more perilous ever since.
Natural disasters can be catastrophic, but their
destructiveness is usually limited, and the really horrendous ones are rare.
Manmade disasters are ubiquitous, very extensive, and difficult, perhaps
impossible, to repair. Had mankind been wise rather than merely smart, most
manmade calamities could have been avoided.
Que Sera Sera! Whatever will be will be will be.
The future is plain to see, and it's not pretty.
