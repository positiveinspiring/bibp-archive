The ISIS fakery
is the same as bin Laden fakery.
Sibel Edmonds has done extensive research on Gladio B and has recently made connections between it and Paris evident in her new interview with James Corbett.
What comes to the fore is Turkey's role in training, arming and exporting radical Islamists. Training took place within the NATO domain, in Turkey and Jordan, whereas the New York Times' report whitewashes it as petty criminals and illegal immigration into China.
Edmonds projects this region to be the next Ukraine, as this area forms what Pepe Escobar terms, "Pipelinestan." The "democracy" exporting NGOs will now bring weaponized "freedom," of course. Sound familiar?
Sibel's analysis backs up my own in terms of the Paris terror events, where two weeks ago I noted the associations with Gladio.
In this regard, we mustn't forget the failed Turkish false flag of 2014, again making the Turkish-French connect:
"What begins to emerge is a consistent pattern of interlocking and interconnected intelligence agencies at the level of "terror event," as well as their assets that all serve the same establishment perched on top. When we consider French intelligence, the fingerprints are no different, as French intelligence has had a long history of false flags and dirty dealings along with their western counterparts in NATO. France helped train the Al Qaeda-linked rebels along with US and British forces in Jordan, a longtime CIA puppet state. Arms and sand pirates are in steady supply for western intelligence agencies needing distractions or desiring to ramp up the terror/security theater. France was also involved in the failed March 2014 Turkish false flag attempt aimed at laying the blame once again on Syria and Assad, and by extension, encroaching further on Russia."

On top of all this, the new boogeyman of rebranded Al Qaeda known as ISIS has been openly admitted today to be a scam from high level CIA and General Kevin Bergner.
[Note: the establishment would have us believe the original Baghdadi was fake, but the new one is real, wink wink.]
Readers may recall my February 2013 article where I cited Bruce Riedel lecturing the Brookings Institute on false flags, as apparently the corporate head audience had never heard of this idea.
This demonstrates Riedel is not a nobody, but a veteran of the deep state who openly discusses false flags and the staged nature of ISIS.
The 2007 New York Times article "The Leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq was Fictional - U.S. Military Says," states, via Zero Hedge:
For more than a year, the leader of one the most notorious insurgent groups in Iraq was said to be a mysterious Iraqi named Abdullah Rashid al-Baghdadi.
As the titular head of the Islamic State in Iraq, an organization publicly backed by Al Qaeda, Baghdadi issued a steady stream of incendiary pronouncements.
Despite claims by Iraqi officials that he had been killed in May, Baghdadi appeared to have persevered unscathed.
On Wednesday, a senior American military spokesman provided a new explanation for Baghdadi's ability to escape attack: He never existed.
Brigadier General Kevin Bergner, the chief American military spokesman, said the elusive Baghdadi was actually a fictional character whose audio-taped declarations were provided by an elderly actor named Abu Adullah al-Naima.
The ruse, Bergner said, was devised by Abu Ayub al-Masri, the Egyptian-born leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, who was trying to mask the dominant role that foreigners play in that insurgent organization.
The ploy was to invent Baghdadi, a figure whose very name establishes his Iraqi pedigree, install him as the head of a front organization called the Islamic State of Iraq and then arrange for Masri to swear allegiance to him.
Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's deputy, sought to reinforce the deception by referring to Baghdadi in his video and Internet statements.
The evidence for the American assertions, Bergner announced at a news briefing, was provided by an Iraqi insurgent:
Khalid Abdul Fatah Daud Mahmud al-Mashadani, who was said to have been captured by American forces in Mosul on July 4.
According to Bergner, Mashadani is the most senior Iraqi operative in Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.
He got his start in the Ansar al-Sunna insurgent group before joining Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia more than two years ago, and became the group's "media emir" for all of Iraq.
Bergner said that Mashadani was also an intermediary between Masri in Iraq and bin Laden and Zawahiri, whom the Americans assert support and guide their Iraqi affiliate.
"Mashadani confirms that al-Masri and the foreign leaders with whom he surrounds himself, not Iraqis, made the operational decisions" for Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, Bergner said.
Bruce Riedel, a former CIA official and a Middle East expert, said that experts had long wondered whether Baghdadi actually existed.
"There has been a question mark about this," he said.
Nonetheless, Riedel suggested that the disclosures made Wednesday might not be the final word on Baghdadi and the leaders of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.
Even Mashadani's assertions, Riedel said, might be a cover story to protect a leader who does in fact exist.
"First, they say we have killed him," Riedel said, referring to the statements by some Iraqi government officials. "Then we heard him after his death and now they are saying he never existed. That suggests that our intelligence on Al Qaeda in Iraq is not what we want it to be."

"Then we heard him after his death and now they are saying he never existed. That suggests that our intelligence on Al Qaeda in Iraq is not what we want it to be."
American military spokesmen insist they have gotten to the truth on Baghdadi. Mashadani, they say, provided his account because he resented the role of foreign leaders in Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.
They say he has not repudiated the organization."
Zero Hedge correctly mentions Iron Man 3, and JaysAnalysis was quick to make that connection back in May of 2013 as well, here.
I wrote, perfectly in line with Sibel's analysis, as follows:
"A year and a half later, the narrative has again emerged, with the rebranded and expired Al Qaeda becoming "ISIS," the new radical Jihad threatening the western world, and in particular a long line of "journalist aid workers" that seem to be in large supply and quite easily captured.
Perceptive readers will be aware, of course, that these are not "journalist aid workers," but known intelligence operatives: "aid" worker is one of the most obvious known covers, and their supposed captors, as well.
In our new staged "beheading," the clip is even more absurd, as once again the film cuts away before any blood, this time without even a head or a body!
The only evidence of the so-called "aid worker's" corpse are two pasty legs. Those could be anyone's legs, but the WWF nature of ISIS and their ridiculous videos will unfortunately continue unabated.
When ISIS shows us their next retarded video and stages the "beheading" of Robert Downey, Jr or Katy Perry, maybe the media whores will begin to lose credibility. Then again, probably not, since Hollywood and ye ole theatre of staged intelligence operations are now the same.
All these videos are intended to do is rile moronic western evangelicals and faux conservatives who don't know their theological ass form a hole in the ground for Huntington's clash of civilizations philosophy."
The bin Laden cut out character thus also matches up to the Baghdadi character now known and confirmed to be an actor.
JaysAnalysis contributor Peter Parker analyzed the connections to bin Laden in-depth in his piece on Iron Man 3.
The point here is that the methodology of Al Qaeda's false fronts are the same as ISIS, demonstrating ISIS is controlled by the same PR companies in the West that serve the interests of the Atlanticist establishment.
We have also seen yet another ISIS "beheading" video that purports to kill two Japanese individuals following the silly ISIS "kid killer" production.
However, as expected, these videos also demonstrate alteration and staging, adding to the long list of Hollywood productions, and even the Japanese government is speaking out about the apparent staging.
It is worth noting the Turkish soap opera clip that reportedly aired prior to any ISIS beheadings that is laughably a carbon copy of the so-called beheadings.
To add the icing to all this, U.S. Generals have now come forward admitting the Obama administration is arming ISIS. We knew this all along, and it's not as if this a Democratic plan.
We can think of the Bushes and the Safari Club and connections to terror outlined in Joseph Trento's Prelude to Terror.
21stCenturyWire comments on this story:
"If you believe all of the pre-packaged government and corporate media propaganda, then you might think that ISIS is just another evil, grassroots Salafist militant movement, one with no connections at all to foreign intelligence agencies like the CIA, Britain's MI6, Turkish (NATO) intelligence, Saudi intelligence, Israeli intelligence, or Pakistan's ISI .
WND reported Monday that in exclusive interviews conducted with 11 of the 17 members of the commission, it is clear that while the CCB is still enthusiastic to work with Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, and hopeful that Boehner is serious about the investigation, various members of the CCB, speaking on their own behalf and not as spokesmen for the commission, are expressing concerns, wanting to make sure the Gowdy investigation is not compromised by elements within the GOP.
The Citizen's Commission on Benghazi's interim report, in a paragraph titled "Changing sides in the War on Terror," alleges,
"the U.S. was fully aware of and facilitating the delivery of weapons to the Al Qaeda-dominated rebel militias throughout the 2011 rebellion."
The report asserted the jihadist agenda of AQIM [Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb], the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and other Islamic terror groups represented among the rebel forces was well-known to U.S. officials responsible for Libya policy.
"The rebels made no secret of their Al Qaeda affiliation, openly flying and speaking in front of the black flag of Islamic jihad, according to author John Rosenthal and multiple media reports," the interim report said. "And yet, the White House and senior Congressional members deliberately and knowingly pursued a policy that provided material support to terrorist organizations in order to topple a ruler who had been working closely with the West actively to suppress Al Qaeda."

The report concluded:
"The result in Libya, across much of North Africa, and beyond has been utter chaos, disruption of Libya's oil industry, the spread of dangerous weapons (including surface-to-air missiles), and the empowerment of jihadist organizations like Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood."
Both Paul Craig Roberts via the Ron Paul Institute and Jean-Marie Le Pen have spoken out about the Paris terror events demonstrating false flag signatures to much furor in the mainstream, yet this shows the perennial terror narrative may be breaking down, as Washington surges eastward under the banner of NGO terror.
Le Pen stated:
"These forgotten passports of the Kouachi brothers remind me of the miraculously surviving passport belonging to a terrorist that fell out of a burning plane on September 11, 2001. New York was in flames, but the passport was clean.
We are now being told that the terrorists are idiots, which is why they left their documents in the car. The Charlie Hebdo shooting has the modus operandi of the special ops, but we have no proof.
I don't think that the French government acted as the organizer of this crime, but they allowed this crime to take place. This is only a guess."
And Paul Craig Roberts wrote:
"The Charlie Hebdo affair has many of the characteristics of a false flag operation.
The attack on the cartoonists' office was a disciplined professional attack of the kind associated with highly trained special forces; yet the suspects who were later corralled and killed seemed bumbling and unprofessional. It is like two different sets of people."
