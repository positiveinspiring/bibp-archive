Newly-released documents obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information
Center (EPIC)
reveal that the US Depart of Homeland Security (DHS)
has been working on plans to roll out a new wave of mobile surveillance
technologies at train stations, stadiums and streets.
These new technologies will track your eye
movements, capture and record your facial dimensions for face-recognition
processing, bathe you in X-rays to look under your clothes, and even image
your naked body using whole-body infrared images that were banned from
consumer video cameras because they allowed the camera owners to take "nude"
videos of people at the beach.
Most importantly, many of these technologies are designed to be completely
hidden, allowing the government to implement "covert inspection of moving
subjects."
You could be walking down a hallway at a sports stadium, in other
words, never knowing that you're being bathed in X-rays from the Department
of Homeland Security, whose operators are covertly looking under your
clothes to see if you're carrying any weapons.
Roving vans to "track
eye movements"
According to a
Forbes article,
one project pursued by DHS using technology from Siemens would,
"mount
backscatter x-ray scanners and video cameras on roving vans, along with
other cameras on buildings and utility poles, to monitor groups of
pedestrians, assess what they carried, and even track their eye movements."
Another project involved developing,
"a system of long range x-ray scanning
to determine what metal objects an individual might have on his or her body
at distances up to thirty feet."
We already know that the U.S. government has purchased 500 vans using covert
backscatter technology to
covertly scan people on the streets.
They're called "Z Backscatter Vans, or ZBVs."
This is all part of the U.S. government's new wave of police state
surveillance that aims to track and irradiate innocent civilians who have
committed no crime. Under the new Janet Napolitano regime, all Americans are
now considered potential terrorists, and anyone can be subjected to
government-sanctioned radiation scanning at any time, without their
knowledge or approval.
And don't think these efforts will be limited merely to backscatter
technology:
The TSA (Transportation Security
Administration) is now testing full-power,
deep-penetrating X-ray machines (like the ones that deliver chest X-rays in
hospitals) in order to check people for bombs they may have swallowed.
Yes,
Janet Napolitano now wants to look inside your colon! And they're willing to
X-ray everyone - without their consent - in order to do that.
Read the documents
yourself
If you have trouble believing the U.S. government is unleashing a new wave
of police state covert scanning vans on to the streets of America, you can
read the documents yourself - all 173 pages (Privacy
Impact Assessment for The Rail Security Pilot Study Phase II at PATH).
EPIC calls these vans "mobile strip search devices" because they give the
federal government technology to look under your clothes without your
permission or consent.
It's also being done without probable cause, so it's
a violation of the Fourth Amendment protections that are guaranteed to
Americans under the Bill of Rights.
"It's a clear violation of the fourth amendment that's very invasive, not
necessarily effective, and poses all the same radiation risks as the airport
scans," said EPIC attorney Ginger McCall, in the Forbes article (above).
Huge health risks to
the population
It's not just the privacy issues that raise red flags here, of course: It's
also the fact that the U.S. government has no respect whatsoever for the
health of its citizens who are being subjected to these radiation emitting
devices.
Even while the TSA refuses to release testing results from its own
naked body scanners, DHS keeps buying more machines (and more powerful
machines) that will only subject travelers to yet more radiation.
As we've already reported here on NaturalNews, numerous scientists are
already on the record warning that the TSA's backscatter "naked body
scanners"
could cause breast cancer, sperm mutation
and other health problems.
But the U.S. government doesn't seem to care what happens to your health.
Their position is that their "right" to know what you're carrying under your
clothes or inside your body overrides your right to privacy or personal
health. All they have to do is float a couple of fabricated terrorism scare
stories every few months, and then use those "threats" as justification for
violating the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens are very turn.
The real question in all this, of course, is how far will this go?
The TSA
is already reaching down your pants and feeling up peoples' genitals as part
of the "security" measures.
-
Will DHS soon just start subjecting people to
body cavity searches as a necessary security requirement before entering a
football stadium, for example?
-
Will Americans now be X-rayed with
cancer-causing ionizing radiation - without their awareness or consent -
merely because they are walking down the street or boarding a train?
That seems to be the case.
And as you can readily tell from all this, it's
getting harder and harder for the fast-dwindling group of deniers to claim
America isn't already a police state.
The USA is fast becoming a high-tech
version of the very worst police state tyrannies witnessed throughout human
history. The only difference is that now they have "science" on their side
with the coolest new technology that can violate your rights and irradiate
your body in a hundred different ways, with high-resolution images and
digital storage devices.
I suppose if all this were being done to really stop international
terrorists, that might be one thing.
But what has become increasingly clear
in observing the government's behavior in this realm is that the U.S.
government now considers Americans to be the enemy - especially those who
have the gall to defend their Constitutionally-protected freedoms or
question the unjustified centralization of power taking place right now in
Washington.
The DHS is America's new secret police. And their cameras are pointing
inward, into the everyday lives of Americans; not outward, aimed at
international terrorists.
When the price of security becomes forfeiting your liberty, the source of
the "terror" is no longer the terrorists but your own government. Isn't this
the lesson that history has taught us well?
Watch the talk by Naomi Wolf, who explains all this extremely well:

happened before in recent history, and the patterns are undeniable.
