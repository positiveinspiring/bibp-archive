The "New Age" of Aquarius is an Astrology doctrine of the 1980s, proclaiming the human race is at the verge of a "gigantic quantum leap", to realize that every human is God... and when that happens, it will be the "New Age", a glorious time with only one nation on earth, one language, one government, one religion, one monetary system... with only love on earth, the "golden age"!, without hate, violence, wars, crime, racism, and without sickness nor death!... This "utopia" is the greatest menace to Christianity, more than any other cult... New age has been catalogued as the AIDS of all heresies. The Essential Belief: The old saying, "God is Dead", is gone; the new theme is "everyone is God... Everyone!. This is the essential belief: All is one, one is God, you are one... that's right, you are God!... You are God!, even if you don't know how to make birds, nor stars, nor the eyes of an insect, nor even a simple leave of a tree... But you are God!... you shape your own destiny, you are capable of overcoming all problems; it is the ultimate philosophy of the "Me Generation"... since the God in you makes all decisions, then whatever you decide is right!... there is not objective truth. The New Age rage is intended to become a "new world order" in which all becomes one: No national boundaries, just one world community in government, religion, economy... all is yours!... and you belong to all!... the world is passing from an old age of materialism into a time of new spirituality... The New Age is an umbrella, an amorphous collection of belief systems... over 1,000 in the Internet!... Unlike most formal religions, it has no holy text, central organization, membership, formal clergy, geographic center, dogma, creed, etc. They often use mutually exclusive definitions for some of their terms.
The New Age is in fact a free-flowing spiritual movement; a network of believers and practitioners who share somewhat similar beliefs and practices, which they add on to whichever formal religion that they follow. Their book publishers take the place of a central organization; seminars, conventions, books and informal groups replace of sermons and religious services. In the New Age umbrella are including all religious systems except Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It includes:
- Monism: All that exists is derived from a single source of divine energy - Pantheism: All that exists is God; God is all that exists. Hinduism Taoism Mormons - Relativism - A belief that all truth, knowledge, and laws are relative to particular perceptions or situations and do not carry universal authority. The objective truth does not exist, all depends of what you think. - Reincarnation of Hinduism: After death, we are reborn and live another life as a human. This cycle repeats itself many times. Reincarnation - Enlightenment of Buddha. Buddhism - All kind of Occultism: Divination, astrology, horoscope, magic, sorcery, witchcraft, wicca, astral projection, spiritualism, spiritism, satanism, santeria, voodoo, alchemy... The Occult - Animism, paganism, the old pagan rituals... Wicca - Hypnosis, transcendental meditation, the use of hallucinogenic drugs or any kind of drug... - New World Order.
As the Age of Aquarius unfolds, a New Age will develop. This will be a utopia in which there is world government, and end to wars, disease, hunger, pollution, and poverty. Gender, racial, religious and other forms of discrimination will cease. People's allegiance to their tribe or nation will be replaced by a concern for the entire world and its people.
And how to become God?:
It is easy: The time of rationalism and materialism and atheism is gone... now it is the time of "pure spiritualism"... but a spiritualism away from Judaism, because the "age of Aries" is gone; and away from the dogmatism of Christianity and Islam, because the "age of Pisces" is also gone... it is the "age of Aquarius", the age of new beginnings, where "intuition" rules...To become God is easy, because you are already God, and the only thing left is that you realize it, and live as God, to have "consciousness of God"... not by "reasons", but by "intuition" in mystical experiences...
"The Methods" Mention it, and you have it in the New Age methods... it is nothing "new", just the old time ancient religions, cults, all kind of superstitions, and false Hinduism and Mormonism!... anything but the truths of Christianity, Judaism and Islam... The methods range through the alphabet of superstition, from acupuncture to Zen Buddhism, taking in yoga meditation, mysticism, spiritualism, crystals, pyramids, clairvoyance, biofeedback, reincarnation therapies, tarot cards, ouija boards, astrology, tea leaves, occult devices, dream therapy, holistic healing, astrological charts, parasychologic mystic experiences, telepathy, self-hypnosis, mind control, spiritistic channelling, balancing the yin and yan, witchcraft rituals, hypnosis, meditation, the use of hallucinogenic drugs or any kind of drug, Egyptian knowledge, mantras, angiology, extraterrestrial beings, neurolinguistic trainers, herbologists, guided imaginary, centering, polarity therapy, reflexology, therapeutic touching, homeopathy... and, of course, any kind of super-sexual activity...
THE DOCTRINE The New Age is the "spiritual AIDS" of our times, because it takes away the defenses of the person by destroying the spiritual immune system of humility. It is the greatest menace against Christianity, an amorphous collection of belief systems... over 1,000 in the Internet!... it looks difficult to understand, but it is very simple, because it is just the old 4 tricks of Satan described in Genesis 3:4-5 when he answered to Eve:
"You will not die; for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil".
These are "the 4 main doctrines" of the New Age different cults and groups:
1- "You will not die": At the core of the New Age is "Reincarnation"... and you will never even be sick with the holistic healing, exercise, diet, herbology, biofeedback, acupuncture, massage techniques, magic, the healing effects of crystals, pyramids, and other many superstitions... Mostly, you will obtain even the utopia of "immortality", because matter and spirit are one (monism). 2- "Your eyes will be opened": You become conscious of how powerful you are, capable of overcoming any problem... this is the "human potential movement" which has made the greatest inroads in the spread of New Age: The "seminars" carried out in major corporations, like RCA, IBM, Boeing, Ford Motor Co., General Dynamics, etc. designed to increase productivity and potential among the employees... The "mortal omnipotence" obtained by occult divinatory devices... or by hallucinogenic drugs, hypnosis... 3-"You will be like God": "Pantheism" is the heart of the New Age: "God is all and all is God"... because God "is not a person", it is "Energy", "the Force"... God is not "He", but "It", a stone, a star, you, I... any atom has energy!... ... The "gigantic quantum leap", is when every human will realize that he is God... and this will occur "suddenly", as a "quantum leap", when enough people on earth have the consciousness of God, of being God!... this great energy will produce the sudden "gigantic leap" of all man and women on earth becoming conscious of God, becoming God!... and that will bring world peace and prosperity, a sudden solution of all the problems of the world!... a universal religion, a "global village", even immortality... To achieve this "consciousness", world festivals of the mind, body, and spirit have been programmed to join the energy of thousands and produce the "quantum leap": Thousands have attended festivals of astrology, numerology, crystals, UFOs... but the "leap" didn't came... In 1986 the "First Race Around the Earth" was organized, carrying a torch around the earth to create this universal energy, but it was a failure!... ... Later, on De.31, 1986, the "Instant of World Cooperation" was programmed, and the "Planet Pentecost" was expected when thousands gathered, but it never came... In 1987, the "Harmonic Convergence" was organized, with 144,000 gathering in tours at ancient sacred places of India... it also failed!... Another road, to obtain this "world consciousness" is by the way of a "Messiah", a world leader or great Avatar: Benjamin Creme attracted much attention in the early 1980s announcing the coming of the Messiah "Lord Maitreya" by 1982; when Maitreya failed to appear, Creme's popularity quickly died. 4- Wisdom: "Knowing good and evil": - The New Age doctrine is essentially an extreme "naturalism": The "mother earth", "Gaia", is God, and beyond the "personal transformation" is the New Age goal of "planetarian transformation": "Pollution" is got to be stopped... because we all are "Planetary Citizens", living in only one village, the "Global Village". - In this new knowledge, music and arts are of the "natural": singing birds, rivers, mountains, the music of rain, storms, the oceans, the desert... ... But in this utopic world of knowledge, something is wrong: Feminism is at its heights, with mother earth, Gaia, at the front... abortion rights, gay rights, animal rights with abortion prohibited in animals, polygamous privileges, homosexual marriages, prostitution, gambling, drugs... all of this in the name of "God in you", for all that God can be and do is focused in the depths of your soul... 5- "The 5th lie of Satan", of Matt.4, is included in this new wisdom: Jesus Christ is discarded, he is not God, and not even the son of man... he is only the "Christ Energy" or the "Cosmic Christ"... better try the occult, astrology, spiritism, astral travel, reincarnation, Goddess worship, mind sciences, yoga meditation, crystals, pyramids... witchcraft or Wicca, white or black magic, sexual magic with each one of the coven having sex with everyone... something is obviously very seriously wrong!...

HISTORY
"An "Umbrella"... "Big Money"!
The New Age is not represented by any one particular organization, institution, or sect. It is called a "Movement", but it is rather an "Umbrella", where many sick minds are covered; a smorgasboard of all paranormal beliefs, polluted with too many money-making schemes...
- Many "members" are honest people, with a deep desire to realize the innate goodness that lies within each person, but looking for it in the wrong places... - Many "leaders" are "big money-makers" becoming famous and rich with their seminars, books, tapes, videos, movies, selling crystals or pyramids for $2 or $400,000; or by doing all kinds of divination with astrology, channelling, psychic readings; or by selling natural health products, or practicing holistic medicine, past live therapies of reincarnation; or organizing tours to old sacred places... and the worst are those who create new cults of "inner wisdom", with large or small groups, whose members will end up giving all their money and lives to the leaders...
The term "New Age", was coined by the spirit medium "Alice Bailey" of the Theosophical Society of America, who died in 1949, but it became common parlance after the musical "Hair" launched the concept of the Age of Aquarius on a popular and international scale.
- The "New Age Magazine", published for decades by Masonry, is one of the forerunners, as well as the "Humanist Manifesto" of 1973, but wit the New Age adding the "unlimited human potential", making each man a God... though no man can make a star or an atom!. - There is not a "founder", nor a "world leader": - "Shirley McLaine", the Academy Award-winner, may be the high priestess of the whole umbrella, with her seminaries, books, TV series... She charges $300 per person to audiences of up to 1,000. Her books: "Out on a Limb" (her transformation), "Dancing in the Light" (crystals and mantras), "Going Within" (yoga and chakras). - "Marilyn Ferguson", with the most prominent book of the New Age, "The Aquarium Conspiracy" (the influence of the New Age on the whole public educational system of America). - "Frijof Capra", with his classic book "The Tao of Physics". On "Eye to Eye" visions the overall "paradigm" or theory that would unite science, philosophy, psychology, religion...- "Barbara Marx Hubbard", one of the organizers of the world programs to promote the "quantum leap" into world God consciousness. - Celebrities: Singers John Denver, Tina Turner, Willie Nelson. Actors Levar Burton, David Carradine, Dennis Weaver. Actresses Linda Evans, Sharon Gless, Sally Kirkland. Movie producers Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Gene Rodenberry... E.T., Star Wars, Star Trek, Ghost... Astronaut Mitchell with "A Course on Miracles"... - Intellectuals: Richard Sutphen, Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, Benjamin Creme, Ram Das, P.D. Ouspensky, Ramtha, David Spangler, J. Arguelles.- Organizations: Planetary Citizens, Pacific Institute, Planetary Initiative, Zero Population, Third Force, Forum, The Work... and 1,001 cults...- In France: Serge Raynaud, with the "Great Universal Fraternity"... the political "Green Party", successful in Europe, not in America.
