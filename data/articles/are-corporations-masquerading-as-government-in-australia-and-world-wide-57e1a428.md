Vs.
Which represents real (de jure) government in Australia?
Which is seen on government literature ?
Would you be surprised to find a company with
the same name as your country registered with the
Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Washington DC? Well, guess
what?!
Among those listed as corporate entities by the
United States SEC are:
...and my personal favorite (and I quote) Her
Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of Alberta as represented by
Alberta Investment Management Corp."
Interesting! So what could all this mean?
For
the purpose of this article we will follow the example of Australia.
Australia
the lucky
country?
-
SEC Entity Name:
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA
-
SEC Central Index Key (CIK): 0000805157
-
SEC Standard Industrial Code (SIC): 8880
(UNKNOWN)
-
SEC Business Address: 1601 MASSACHUSETTS
AVE NW WASHINGTON DC 20036
-
Fiscal Year End: 0630
Well, that certainly
raises some questions!
Why is
a company called COMMONWEALTH
OF AUSTRALIA
registered in Washington DC? What reason could there be for a country to be
registered as a company?
By definition, arent corporate and government
entities mutually exclusive? And doesnt government regulate companies?
Why would Australia be registered with the SEC
in the United States? And why would it provide a Prospectus and annual
Economic and Fiscal Outlook documents to the SEC? And be subject to SEC
regulation?
Why is the
Great Seal of Australia a trademark registered with
United States Patent and Trademark Office?
Could the Australian Government be a corporate
entity masquerading as real government, for profit, and not for the purpose
of governance? Does the Australian Government truly represent the people
and not shareholders in another country?
Why do todays government departments have
corporate mission statements like we
provide services on BEHALF of government and our
CLIENTS include government...?
What happened to we ARE
government?? Does this suggest they are NOT true government, but a company
masquerading as government?
If a company registered in Washington DC is
falsely claiming government status in Australia, what happened to the real
(de jure) government with a similar name? And when?
And are the laws in Australia therefore just
rules for employees and contractors of the corporation?
Interesting. Lets look a little closer
Perhaps it is a requirement that the
Commonwealth of Australia registers as a company entity in order to trade
with the United States of America. Are all the other countries who trade
with the United States also registered on the American SEC? Is the United
States of America also registered with ASIC, the Australian Securities &
Investments Commission? And is Australia similarly registered with the
corresponding trade regulators in other countries?
The answer appears to be NO.
International trade implies mutual agreement;
reciprocity; a common method of exchange. But the reality is that the
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA is registered as a corporate entity with the
United States SEC, but not the other way around.
There appear to be no comparable corporate
entities registered in other countries with which Australia trades. And
nations ranking among the United States biggest trading partners do NOT
have corporate avatars registered with the American SEC. Perhaps
registration in Washington DC is for the purpose of trading Government
Bonds.
Interesting
but this strange corporate entity is
only half the story.
Before government bonds can even exist, surely there
must first be a legitimate government.
Government and the role
of Governor-General in Australia
In Australia, the Governor-General
is the representative of the Monarch (currently Queen Elizabeth II)
and the Administrator of Government.
Given that the Governor-General
administers government in Australia, government can only exist in Australia
with a valid Governor-General. The Governor-General is reliant upon the
existence of the Office of Governor-General, which was originally
constituted by the late Queen Victoria in Letters Patent dated 29th October
1900, passed under the Monarchs seal - the Great Seal Of The United Kingdom
(view
Letters Patent 1900).
The power and authority to revoke, alter or
amend those Letters Patent was reserved by the late Queen Victoria to her
heirs and successors.
Given those Letters Patent were issued under the Great
Seal of the United Kingdom, surely any revocation, alteration or
amendment must be issued by an heir and successor under the same Seal.
So whats the problem?
In 1984, Letters Patent supposedly revoked the
original Letters Patent of 1900 and provided new provisions for the Office
of Governor-General
(view Letters Patent 1984).
This happened under the Great Seal of
Australia, which we already know is a corporate trademark registered with
the United States Patent & Trademark Office in the U.S.
(view registration)
Surely such an attempt at revocation cannot
therefore be lawful? And if not, what Office is the Governor-General in
Australia presently occupying? Is the person we call Governor-General
truly a representative of an heir and successor to the late Queen
Victoria?
The answer appears to be NO.
Given that the Governor-General appoints
Ministers, Judges, Commissioners and Justices of the Peace, and ascribes
Royal Assent as the Monarchs representative in Australia - using the
Monarchs Seal - in the absence of a valid Governor-General,
are
there any legitimate government offices in Australia?
Again
the answer appears to be NO.
So lets test the theory
A case study
Wake Up World friend and colleague Scott Bartle
documented his recent dealings with Australian Customs & Border
Protection Service in his self-funded below documentary What The FUQ? -
Frequently Unanswered Questions of the Australian Government.
This simple, concise and sometimes hilarious
case-study follows Scotts ongoing interactions with a supposed government
entity that simply does not behave as a genuine government agency should.
And all he did was ask them to demonstrate their
validity!
What The FUQ?
Frequently Unanswered
Questions of the "Australian Government"
So
IS the Australian Government the
same government the original Office of Governor-General was intended to
Administer?
Its a question that officials at all levels of
Australian Government have seem unwilling or unable to answer. Some
readers may think Im a crack-pot for even asking the question. Break out
the tin-foil hats! theyll cry!
But please
before you form an opinion or
post a comment on this article, ask the Australian Government the same
question yourself:
Can you please demonstrate that todays Office
of Governor-General is the same Office that was constituted by the late
Queen Victoria in Letters Patent of 1900?
It is your right, after all. And there are
certainly some details that dont add up. But it gets better
Thats odd, they certainly don't ACT
like a true government...
At first Government may just ignore you. But
since anyone claiming government status has a responsibility to prove it,
their silence is very indicative, dont you think? So push your Government a
little further, and see what happens when you really start to question whos
who.
Taxes & fines are suddenly waived, and miraculously, licenses & permits
are no longer required!
And it doesnt stop there.
-
Does this sound like the behavior of legitimate
government? NO, it does not.
-
If challenged, does a legitimate government not
simply demonstrate its validity and continue to act within its lawful
authority?
-
Or does legitimate government exempt that persons
responsibilities and wave them through the gates, quickly, quietly and with
a minimum of fuss? Nothing to see here!
Is this situation unique to Australia?
Lets find out!
To our friends and readers from the Commonwealth
of Australia, we recommend you contact your local
Members and Senators
and ask them
one simple question:
Can you please demonstrate that todays
Office of Governor-General is the same Office that was constituted by the
late Queen Victoria in Letters Patent of 1900?
To our friends and readers outside Australia, we
recommend you identify the documents that established the original offices
of government in your country, then ask
one simple question
of your government representatives:
Can you please demonstrate that todays
government is the same one as established at the inception of this country?
Demonstrating its own legitimacy is a very
simple thing that every government agency should be able to do.
And in a
true democracy, silence is an unacceptable response of government to
questions of its very legitimacy. But today the Australian Government
appears unwilling or unable to prove its legitimacy.
Is yours?
It only takes a few minutes to write to your
local members office. Please come back to Wake Up World and tell our
readers how your enquiry was met. Silence? Jargon? Or a simple demonstration
of your governments legitimacy?
Wed love to hear your stories, so please
leave a comment or
send us an email
So what the FUQ do we do next?
Written enquiries made to Ministers and
Government agencies, to the Office of the Prime Minister and to the Office
of Governor General remain unanswered.
So in the absence of a response from
Government, Wake Up World supports respectfully
escalating this matter to the current Monarch, Her Majesty,
The Queen.
Surely Her Majesty must know the answer:
-
why a
corporation in the United States bears the name COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA
-
why in 1984 her authority to amend the provisions for the Office of
Governor-General was granted on a company letterhead
-
why those claiming to
represent true government in Australia have been unable to prove that
status
-
why some, when challenged, may suddenly overlook ones
obligations and run silently in the other direction
SIGN THE PETITION
and ask Her Majesty for the truth.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE
we
all have a right to know.
HOLD YOUR GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE
it is just
one simple question.
In a true democracy, silence is an unacceptable
answer of government to questions of its legitimacy.
