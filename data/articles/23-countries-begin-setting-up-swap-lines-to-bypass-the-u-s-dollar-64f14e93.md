# 23 Countries Begin Setting Up Swap Lines to Bypass the U.S. Dollar

For several years, financial analysts,
primarily those outside the mainstream of academia, have been warning
that any day could be the black swan event that collapses the dollar,
and ends U.S. hegemony as caretaker of the world's reserve currency.
That day has finally arrived as on Nov. 18,
a former head trader for a major financial institution issued a
harbinger and stated that 23 countries, and 60% of the world's GDP, are
right now setting up new swap lines which bypass the dollar,
SWIFT, and
the BIS, and will usher in a new global
currency system which will kill the dollar.
The thoughts that are put into the
minds of men that are aware of what is occurring on trading floors
all over the world is when? When is also the question that I get
asked about quite often by thousands of people.
So what is the when? The when is
what is the sure sign that this fraudulent sham that we call an
economy is over?
Folks the biggest sign is when those that trade in the dollar to
acquire goods, no longer want the worthless paper because of US
bully policies or they have totally lost faith in the US as a
responsible steward of its currency and economy. That day has
arrived.
All over the world economies that
have not totally shot themselves in the foot by gambling in the
Anglo-American casino are now moving to set up various currency
exchanges by passing the dollar.

The above
list of the 23 countries which are
creating new swap lines outside of the dollar include,
...and surprisingly,
-
Germany
-
France
-
the United Kingdom
This means that the Eurozone itself is
abandoning the dollar, and preparing for transition to a new central
banking system.
To facilitate the transfer of currencies and
swap lines, there needs to be a bank of sufficient size and stature to
aid in handling of this monumental task. One year ago, China, along with
the BRICs nations of Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, loaned
money to a new
financial institution they established
and labeled the
BRICs bank.
This bank was created with the intention of
bypassing the dollar, and allowing free trade to occur between nations
without the need to trade for dollars first, as is currently the format
under the petrodollar system.
In fact, the new BRICs bank will function
both as a bank of international settlement, as well as a lender of last
resort, eliminating the need for the BIS and IMF, which currently reside
under dollar dominion.
The only thing that stands in the way of the
world's final rejection of the dollar is the wavering trust that Saudi
Arabia and OPEC have with the U.S. in assuring oil transactions remain
denominated in dollars under the 1970's Petrodollar agreement. But as
the world has seen recently, even the Saudi kingdom is hedging towards a
new global system, and has publicly stated that their ties to the U.S.
are open for
re-negotiation.
What started in September of last year, when
an
agreement between China and Russia
ended the dollar's stranglehold over oil and how it was purchased, the
past 14 months have seen a momentous rush towards setting up the
infrastructure to replace the dollar completely in global transactions.
And with 23 countries, including those from
the BRICs nations and the Eurozone,
preparing for new swap lines outside of dollar hegemony, the fuse has
been lit on the dollar's death rattle, and the when has changed into the
now.
