The first ever
GAO (Government Accountability
Office) audit of the Federal Reserve was carried out in the past few months
due to the Ron Paul, Alan Grayson Amendment to the
Dodd-Frank bill, which
passed last year.
Jim DeMint, a Republican Senator, and Bernie Sanders, an
independent Senator, led the charge for a Federal Reserve audit in the
Senate, but watered down the original language of the house bill(HR1207), so
that a complete audit would not be carried out. Ben Bernanke (above
image), Alan Greenspan, and various other bankers vehemently opposed the
audit and lied to Congress about the effects an audit would have on markets.
Nevertheless, the results of the first audit in the Federal Reserves nearly
100 year history were
posted on Senator Sanders webpage earlier
this morning.
What was revealed in the audit was startling:
$16,000,000,000,000.00 had
been secretly given out to US banks and corporations and foreign banks
everywhere from France to Scotland.
From the period between December 2007
and June 2010, the Federal Reserve had secretly bailed out many of the
worlds banks, corporations, and governments.
The Federal Reserve likes to
refer to these secret bailouts as an all-inclusive loan program, but
virtually none of the money has been returned and it was loaned out at 0%
interest.
Why the Federal Reserve had never been public about this or even
informed the United States Congress about the $16 trillion dollar bailout is
obvious - the American public would have been outraged to find out that the
Federal Reserve bailed out foreign banks while Americans were struggling to
find jobs.
To place $16 trillion into perspective, remember that GDP of the United
States is only $14.12 trillion.
The entire national debt of the United
States government spanning its 200+ year history is only $14.5 trillion.
The budget that is being debated so heavily in Congress and the Senate is
only $3.5 trillion.
Take all of the outrage and debate over the $1.5
trillion deficit into consideration, and swallow this Red pill:
There was no
debate about whether $16,000,000,000,000 would be given to failing banks and
failing corporations around the world.
In late 2008, the
TARP Bailout bill was passed and loans of $800 billion
were given to failing banks and companies.
That was a blatant lie
considering the fact that Goldman Sachs alone received 814 billion dollars.
As is turns out, the Federal Reserve donated $2.5 trillion to Citigroup,
while Morgan Stanley received $2.04 trillion.
The Royal Bank of Scotland and
Deutsche Bank, a German bank, split about a trillion and numerous other
banks received hefty chunks of the $16 trillion.
This is a clear case of socialism for the rich and rugged,
youre-on-your-own individualism for everyone else.
Bernie Sanders (I-VT)
When you have conservative Republican stalwarts like
Jim DeMint (R-SC) and
Ron Paul (R-TX) as well as self identified Democratic socialists like
Bernie
Sanders all fighting against the Federal Reserve, you know that it is no
longer an issue of Right versus Left.
When you have every single member of
the Republican Party in Congress and progressive Congressmen like Dennis
Kucinich sponsoring a bill to audit the Federal Reserve, you realize that
the Federal Reserve is an entity onto itself, which has no oversight and no
accountability.
Americans should be swelled with anger and outrage at the abysmal state of
affairs when an unelected group of bankers can create money out of thin air
and give it out to megabanks and supercorporations like Halloween candy.
If
the Federal Reserve and the bankers who control it believe that they can
continue to devalue the savings of Americans and continue to destroy the US
economy, they will have to face the realization that their trillion dollar
printing presses will eventually plunder the world economy.
