# George Soros' Giant Globalist Footprint in Ukraine's Turmoil

Billionaire investor/activist
George Soros has a giant
footprint in Ukraine.
Similar to his operations in dozens of
other nations, he has, over the past couple of decades, poured tens
of millions of dollars into Ukrainian non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), ostensibly to assist them in transforming their country into
a more "open" and "democratic" society.
Many of the participants in Kiev's "EuroMaidan"
demonstrations were members of Soros-funded NGOs and/or were trained
by the same NGOs in the many workshops and conferences sponsored by
Soros' International Renaissance Foundation (IRF),
and his various Open Society institutes and foundations.
The IRF, founded and funded by Soros,
boasts that it has given,
"more than any other donor
organization" to "democratic transformation" of Ukraine.
The International Renaissance
Foundation's Annual Report for 2012, the latest available, states
that,
"IRF provided UAH 63 million in
funding to civil society organizations - more than any other
donor organization working in this field in Ukraine."
The "UAH" reference used above refers to
the Ukraine Hryvnia, Ukraine's currency, which is worth about 0.11
$US, or eleven cents in U.S. currency.
That translates into, roughly, $6.7
million that IRF provided to Ukrainian groups in 2012; not a huge
sum, by comparison to many other political and social campaigns, but
more than merely "significant."
In the cash-starved Ukraine, Soros's
dollars go a long way toward seducing and co-opting all legitimate
political opposition into the Soros-approved "progressive" camp.
According to the IRF's own website, this
one Soros conduit has
funneled over $100 million into Ukrainian NGOs over the years:
Over the period from 1990 to 2010 the
International Renaissance Foundation provided more than $100 million
in support to numerous Ukrainian non-government organizations
(NGOs), community groups, academic and cultural institutions,
publishing houses, etc.
The IRF website and annual reports make
clear that the Soros funds are targeted at promoting Ukrainian
"partnership" with, and "integration" into, the EU.
Soros has provided many millions more
through his other "philanthropic" spigots. However, Soros' influence
in Ukraine extends far beyond the traceable funding he provides to
activist Ukrainian NGOs, academics and think tanks.
Equally, if not more, important is the
influence he exerts on global opinion through his massive propaganda
network (including
Project Syndicate and other Soros megaphones) and
his direct personal contacts with presidents, prime ministers,
parliamentarians, central bankers, media executives, and Wall Street
titans.
In a February 26 column he penned for
Project Syndicate that was carried by hundreds of newspapers and
websites, Soros argued that the EU and the IMF must initiate a new
Marshall Plan for Ukraine, meaning, of course, transfers of money
from EU and U.S. taxpayers to the politicians, organizations, and
institutions approved by the globalist/socialist/corporatist
operatives running the EU and IMF.
Perhaps the key point in Soros' essay,
entitled, "Sustaining Ukraine's Breakthrough," is this:
"Ukraine will need outside
assistance that only the EU can provide: management expertise."
George Soros is all about management by
"experts," i.e., central planning, the hallmark of every socialist,
fascist, or communist regime.
In fact, he is one of the planet's
premier advocates of global central planning and control.
Hence, he
is a longtime fervent supporter of,
...and virtually every other internationalist endeavor to subvert
national sovereignty and advance the building of an omnipotent world
government.
His fetish with internationalism
includes, especially, further enlarging and empowering the EU, which
has been the prime subject of concern in books and essays by Soros,
as well as many of his speeches and media interviews.
Soros is a full-blown proponent of total
political and economic "integration" of the EU, meaning a complete
annihilation of any residual independence of the EU member states
and the transfer of all substantive legislative, executive, and
judicial powers to EU politicians and administrators in Brussels.
Over the past several years Soros has
been particularly emphatic in pushing for a central EU Treasury, or
European Fiscal Authority (EFA), which
he says is,
"the missing ingredient that is
needed to make the euro a full-fledged currency with a genuine
lender of last resort."
The European Central Bank (ECB), says
Soros, has insufficient powers to do what is needed, even though he
admits it has illegally usurped powers - which he applauds.
When European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi (a former Goldman Sachs vice chairman and managing
director) announced on August 1, 2012 that the ECB would "do
whatever it takes to preserve the euro as a stable currency," German
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann objected, pointing out
that the ECB's powers are limited by statute.
Nevertheless, Draghi forged ahead,
promising that the ECB would make unlimited purchases of government
bonds of indebted EU members - provided they put their countries
under the control of executors from "the Troika" - the EU
Commission, ECB and IMF.
This is the same Troika that devastated
the citizens of Cyprus last year,
raiding their bank accounts to pay off the bonds that socialist
politicians and Goldman Sachs had saddled them with.
But Soros, whose many "human rights"
fronts extol the "rule of law," "accountability," and
"transparency," says that the lawless and unaccountable Troika does
not have enough power! It must be complimented by an EFA, says he,
which should exercise power over all fiscal matters.
The IMF's Managing Director Christine
Lagarde and EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso
(a "former" Maoist Communist) have already lined up a multi-billion
package for Ukraine.
However, many Ukrainians, all across the
political spectrum, are leery of coming under the Troika's control,
and rightfully so. They do not want to trade the corruption and
oppression of Yanukovych's pro-Kremlin regime for another dictated
by the EU and IMF.
As we
pointed out recently, even the poll commissioned by the U.S.
State Department found that only 37 percent of Ukrainians favored
joining the EU.
Economist Michael Roberts
describes himself on his blogsite as "a Marxist economist."
Nevertheless, Roberts is on the mark in
his February 27 column in stating:
"The people of Ukraine are left with
Hobson's choice: either go with KGB-led crony capitalism from
Russia or go with equally corrupt pro-European democrats'."
He is also correct in asserting that
Ukraine's foreign debt will soon double, if it takes
IMF loans, and
that the Ukrainian people will burdened with crushing debt for a
generation.
He writes:
Ukraine could still stage a financial
meltdown and a banking collapse.
More likely, the new government
will be helped over the next few months with bridging loans until
the IMF deal is struck. Then the hardship for the people will really
begin in earnest.
Ukraine's foreign debt is about to
double as it takes on new debt from the IMF and the cost of existing
dollar and euro debt jumps as the
hyrvnia is devalued. This burden
will be on shoulders of Ukrainians for a generation.
Only it could double several times over,
and it could burden Ukrainians for much longer than a generation; it
could fasten them with debt bondage in perpetuity.
Bosnian writer Andrej Nikolaidis
warns Ukrainians that massive debt and grinding poverty under
Troika-managed regime are to be expected.
"It hardly comes as a surprise to us
in former Yugoslavia,"
writes Nikolaidis.
"At the beginning of its
dissolution, the Yugoslav foreign debt was £9.5bn; today, after
all the help' we got from the troika, it's more than £107bn."
He continues:
Bosnia today is a poor and divided
country, even more so than it was back in 1992. Former soldiers,
hungry and sick, are gathering and protesting.
"While we were bleeding, they were
stealing," says one
Some Bosnians saw their future under the
Bosnian and EU flag, others under the Croatian and EU flag, and
others still under the flag of The Great Serbia. Lots of flags, but
only one poverty for all.
But why must Ukraine formally join
either the EU or the Kremlin-sponsored Customs Union? Are those the
only options? Is it not possible for Ukraine to adopt a neutral
position of independence and peaceful trade with both sides? Would
not such a position be best for all concerned?
From the available polling, it seems
that may be the view of a plurality, if not a majority, of
Ukrainians.
Ukraine's huge network of natural gas
pipelines not only supply much-needed Russian-produced gas to EU
countries, but also is the source of vital revenues to Russia from
that energy delivery system. The peoples of Russia, Ukraine and the
EU benefit from a stable, peaceful, neutral Ukraine; forcing
Ukrainians into choosing one or the other camp benefits no one -
except the power-mad rulers of Russia and the EU, and their
globalist confreres.
Why then, should Americans take
direction from,
...and other internationalist voices who insist it is Ukraine that must
"choose"
but the only choice considered acceptable and legitimate
to the globalist choir is for Ukraine to join the EU?
Soros and his huge stable of "public
intellectuals" at Project Syndicate have been flooding the global
media with propaganda to that purpose. As we've reported previously,
Project Syndicate is a project of
George Soros' Open Society Foundation that has sprouted into a
network of nearly 500 newspapers in more than 150 countries with
worldwide circulation of over 70 million copies.
According to the syndicate's web site,
it is the largest syndication of independent commentators in the
world.
However, his great wealth, foundations,
media presence and network of activist NGOs notwithstanding, George
Soros' power and influence - in Ukraine and elsewhere - stem not so
much from these oft-cited trappings of power, but from the fact that
he is a player, an Insider, in the top rank of globalists who are
pushing and shoving "global governance" upon the entire planet.
This was formally recognized in November
2010 when Soros received the "Globalist
of the Year Award" from the Canadian International Council (CIC).
Soros' real heft derives from the fact
that he is a member of the globalist power elite.
First and
foremost, he is a member of (and leader in and major financial
supporter of) the
Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the premier globalist brain
trust that has become the de facto governing force within the
executive branch of the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve
System, as well as Democrat and Republican parties, for most of the
past century.
His Soros Fund Management is a
President's Circle Corporate Member of the CFR and Soros himself
served as a director of the CFR for a decade (1995-2004).
In addition, he has been a key
participant in many CFR events, including serving as presider at the
CFR's 2000 conference, "Latin America: Sustaining Economic &
Political Reform," a major sendoff promoting the Free Trade Area of
the America's (FTAA).
Further, he has been an activist
participant with, and sometime funder of, important globalist
organizations such as,
-
the Brookings Institution
-
the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace
-
the World Policy Conference
-
the World Economic Forum
-
the International Crisis Group
-
the Clinton Global Initiative
-
the
Bilderberg Group
-
the U.S. State Department
-
the Gorbachev Foundation
-
the
United Nations
-
The Good Club (an exclusive billionaire club - whose
members include Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, David
Rockefeller, Ted Turner, Michael Bloomberg, and Oprah
Winfrey - with the singular purpose of pushing global
population control)
Per the UN, Soros has served on a number
of boards and advisory groups promoting a global "Tobin Tax" on
financial transactions, global controls on CO2 to stop
"Climate Change," dramatically expanding the powers and funding of
the International Monetary Fund, and massive global wealth
redistribution through the UN's Millennium Development Goals.
Many of Soros' critics on both the Left
and the Right ignore these facts and treat Soros as if he is a
singular earthshaking force all on his own.
Focusing solely on his grant
distributions, political donations, NGO networks, etc., they greatly
exaggerate his importance, which can act as a diversion to distract
liberty-minded advocates from focusing on the bigger picture.
Taken in isolation, without his tie-ins
to the CFR-globalist network of power, Soros' global impact would
be, not insignificant, but marginal. It is precisely because he is
one of many super-wealthy globalists (albeit , he is far more
visible and vocal than most) acting in concert that his impact is so
remarkable.
Especially noteworthy in relation to
Ukraine is his key involvement in the American-Ukrainian Advisory
Committee (AUAC).
The Ukrainian Weekly of
December 10, 1995,
reported:
The American-Ukrainian Advisory
Committee met in New York on November 17-18 [1995] and reiterated
its strong conviction that a resilient Ukraine is in the interest of
European stability and thus also American security."
Among other things, the AUAC called
upon,
-
the U.S. Congress
-
USAID
-
the IMF
-
the World Bank
-
the EU,
...to shower the Ukrainian government
(then run by "former" Communist Leonid Kuchma).
It also encouraged
the Ukrainian government to hasten "privatization" by selling
"blocks of equity to private investors." Kuchma followed their advice and, as in
the former Soviet Union, his false "privatization" scheme
transferred enormous state assets into the hands of select Communist
Party members, creating instant billionaire oligarchs, who have
dominated Ukraine ever since.
Sitting on the UAUC with Soros were
one-world CFR heavyweights,
The same one-worlders are pushing the
same agenda today, two decades later.
Oligarchs R Us
One of the billionaire oligarchs who
benefitted from the Ukraine's crony privatization program is
Victor Pinchuk, with whom Soros has been very active.
Soros's foundations and The Victor Pinchuk Foundation collaborate on funding many NGOs and projects, in
Ukraine and elsewhere. And Soros is a participant in Pinchuk's Yalta
European Strategy (YES) conferences, annual extravaganzas held in
the Crimea at Livadia Palace, a summer retreat of Russian czars on
the Black Sea.
The YES confabs feature current and
former presidents, prime ministers, potentates, financiers,
corporate execs and celebrities.
Besides Soros, U.S. participants have
included,
-
Bill Clinton
-
William Daley (Obama's White
House Chief of Staff)
-
Robert Zoellick (Bush's Trade
representative, then president of the World Bank)
-
Newt Gingrich
-
Condoleezza Rice,
...to name a few - Democrats and
Republicans, CFR globalists all.
Pinchuk, a pal and funder of both Bill
and Hillary Clinton, not only has generously supported Bill's
Clinton Global Initiative, but also has poured more than $13 million
into the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.
Another close tie is Douglas E. Schoen (CFR),
a longtime Clinton operative and political consultant, whom,
according to the New York Times, Mr. Pinchuk hired as an
adviser in 2000 - and to whom the oligarch has been paying a tidy
retainer of $40,000 per month ever since.
One of the important ventures that Soros
and Pinchuk are financing is the Ukrainian Crisis Media Center
(CMC), a collaboration of Ukrainian public relations corporations
and journalists that is headquartered in Kiev's Hotel Ukraine.
Ostensibly, it was created to counter
the propaganda onslaught of Putin's Russian media cartel. Much of
the "independent news" we receive from Ukraine is produced by the
CMC and stamped with the Pinchuk/Soros-approved brand of propaganda.
That includes cheering on or papering
over the fact that the "new" government in Kiev is simply the latest
rotation of musical chairs, and it has ended with Pinchuk's fellow
oligarchs (virtually all of which are "former" communists) and their
parliamentary blocs and political parties occupying the most
important chairs (as we
reported here).
Pinchuk is a member of the Board of the
Peterson Institute for International Economics and sits on the
International Advisory Council of the Brookings Institution, both of
which Soros has long been associated with.
Another very important Soros-Pinchuk tie
is their mutual connection to the famous (or infamous, as you
prefer) Rothschild banking dynasty.
In 2011, George C. Karlweis,
adviser to Baron
Edmond de Rothschild and his Banque Privee,
revealed that it was
Rothschild who provided Soros with the
startup money - and, undoubtedly much (illegal) insider trading
intelligence - for Soros' fabulously successful Quantum Fund.
The full extent of Pinchuk's connections
to the Rothschild's global private empire would require a similar
revelation from an insider.
That could be Jean-Pierre Saltiel, who
sits on the board of Pinchuk's Yalta European Strategy, as well as
the oligarch's global steel and metallurgy conglomerate, Interpipe,
Inc. He is also a longtime adviser to the Rothschilds and the past
president of Rothschild Conseil International, one of the fabled
family's major bank holding companies.
Interestingly (but not so surprising),
Rothschild agent Saltiel also sits on the board of PIK Group,
Russia's largest residential real estate developer, founded by
Russian oligarchs Yuri Zhukov and Kirill Pisaerev (and still run by
Pisaraev).
Like Soros and the Rothschilds,
Ukrainian oligarch Pinchuk works with and partners with a number of
Russian oligarchs. And his YES summits regularly feature
Putin-allied Russian oligarchs, as well as Putin-appointed Russian
politicians and apparatchiks.
Alfa Bank, Russia's largest private
bank, for example, is a YES sponsor. And Alfa Bank chairman, Mikhail Fridman, a Putin ally and one of Russia's richest billionaires, sits
on the CFR's International Advisory Board and provided the funds to
create the CFR's "Russia and Russian-American Relations Lecture"
program.
Similarly, Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's
richest oligarch, a former Putin-Yanukovych supporter and ally, is
now a member of the new government. He is also, along with Fridman
and Soros, a YES sponsor and a business partner with Russian, EU and
U.S. Insiders.
What these and dozens of other similar
examples indicate is that there is much more to all of the Sturm
und Drang over the Ukraine-Russia-EU "crisis" than meets the
eye.
Soros gave a strong clue as to what the
scripted outcome of the scenario would likely be.
His solution would
see Russia as a "partner," and Angela Merkel (the "former" Communist
from East Germany who now runs the unified Germany) would be the
broker.
"Germany should take the lead,"
Soros said, in his February 26 Project Syndicate column cited
above.
"Chancellor Angela Merkel must reach
out to President Vladimir Putin to ensure that Russia is a
partner, not an opponent, in the Ukrainian renaissance."
Putin as Prod
for "Convergence"
Merkel appears to be doing just
the opposite, threatening Putin with sanctions, including freezing
of Russian bank accounts and restrictions on travel in the EU,
unless Putin "deescalates" the situation and comes to the bargaining
table.
But, in reality, she is "reaching out"
to Putin, and he, after providing what is deemed an appropriate
level of drama, will likely come to the table and deescalate.
Contrary to the Russia's current
bellicose posturing, it is in the Kremlin's interests to offload
Ukraine onto the taxpayers of the EU and the United States, and it
fits perfectly with
their long-term strategy of "convergence" with the EU and the
United States.
Anatoliy Golitsyn, arguably the most
important KGB defector to escape to the West, exposed the top-secret
Soviet convergence strategy in his books New Lies for Old
and The Perestroika Deception. (See
here, here, and
here.)
Mikhail Gorbachev was making oblique reference to the
ongoing reality of the convergence process when he described the EU
as "the new European Soviet." As in the transmutation described in
Orwell's Animal Farm, when it became almost impossible to tell the
pigs from the men, it is now becoming all but impossible to detect
any substantive differences between the ruling elites of Russia,
China, the EU and the United States.
And, as the EU and the United
States adopt more socialist policies and police-state measures,
there is less and less distinction between our societies and the one
ruled over by Putin and his Kremlin cronies.

...and
their ilk see themselves as the Caesars or Pharaohs in their
long-schemed-for "new world order," a term that Soros used several
times in a television interview (see
here) to describe his vision for the future.
Employing the indispensible insight and
analysis provided by Golitsyn and the detailed information in his
books, it is difficult to view the orchestrated chaos that has been
unfolding in Ukraine without recognizing unmistakable evidence that
it is being directed along a pre-planned path toward EU-U.S.-Ukraine-Russian
convergence.
Putin's role is to rattle the sabers menacingly enough
to frighten reluctant Ukraine to join the EU, while also convincing
American and EU taxpayers to be forthcoming with the foreign aid and
IMF funding that will "rescue" Ukraine and avert a war.
And, after
things settle down, we will look around to find Putin and his
oligarchs carrying on business as usual with the new Ukraine
government and its oligarchs, as well as with the
Obama
administration and "our" oligarchs, including, of course, George
Soros.
We have seen this play many times
before.
In their book, The Wise Men, a hagiographic
portrait of six CFR luminaries, authors Walter Isaacson (CFR) and
Evan Thomas record a conversation in which top CFR insider and
Marshall Plan architect John J. McCloy explained how he and fellow
internationalists sold the scheme to Americans by pretending it was
needed to fight Soviet Communism.
Isaacson and Thomas quote McCloy:
"People sat up and listened when the
Soviet threat was mentioned," he later said. "It taught him a
valuable lesson: One way to assure that a viewpoint gets noticed is
to cast it in terms of resisting the spread of Communism."
And McCloy was far from the only one.
Dean Acheson, another of the CFR "Wise Men," did likewise.
"Acheson," Isaacson and Thomas note, "concluded that the
anti-Communist rhetoric was necessary to win support for the British
package."
Now, the point is not that there was no
Soviet Communist threat at the time; the threat was definitely real.
The point is that McCloy, Acheson, and their CFR cohorts had no
intention of fighting communism and they knew that the Marshall Plan
was certainly no anti-Communist program. In fact, it transferred
billions of dollars from American taxpayers into the coffers of
Europe's socialist parties and politicians, and especially into the
movements to create the European Coal and Steel Community, the
nascent seed of the European Union.
Far from being anti-Communists,
-
McCloy
-
Acheson
-
Averill Harriman
-
Charles Bohlen
-
Robert Lovett,
...and other CFR engineers of the Marshall Plan were ardent anti-anti-Communists
who orchestrated vicious campaigns against genuine anti-Communists
such as,
-
Chiang Kai-Shek
-
Gen. George S. Patton
-
Gen. Douglas
MacArthur
-
Sen. Joseph McCarthy
-
Sen. Robert Taft
-
Robert Welch
And, all the while McCloy and company were promoting and deploying
the Marshall Plan - ostensibly to combat Communism - they were also
continuing the longstanding policies of previous CFR-dominated
administrations of providing enormous financial and technological
aid to the Soviet Union, as this publication and the detailed books
of Prof. Antony Sutton (The Best Enemy Money Can Buy,
National Suicide, and his three-volume Western Technology
and Soviet Economic Development) thoroughly exposed.
But, no
matter, the CFR "Wise Men" knew that the vast majority of Americans
were anti-Communist and if they wanted to sell their program to
Americans they'd have to fraudulently package it as an
anti-Communist one.
It is not mere coincidence that George
Soros and other globalists are invoking the Marshall Plan and Cold
War rhetoric today, and citing Putin's revived Soviet-style
militarism, to sell their latest EU-IMF convergence gambit.
It has
worked for them many times in the past.
So, for weeks we have been
treated to the incredibly odd spectacle of,
-
George Soros
-
Barack
Obama
-
Hillary Clinton
-
John Kerry
-
Ivo Daalder,
...et al, and the
denizens of,
-
the
New York Times
-
the
Washington Post
-
CNN
-
PBS
...vying for the honor of claiming Joe McCarthy's mantle.
Will we fall for it again? Americans
would be wise to call a halt to this orchestrated rush to push
Ukraine into the arms of,
-
Manuel Barroso
-
Mario Draghi
-
Christine Lagarde,
...and to stick us, and the Ukrainian people, with the bill.
