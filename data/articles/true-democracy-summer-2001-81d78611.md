Defense Intelligence Agency
From DIA's Web site:
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is a designated
Combat Support Agency and the senior military intelligence component of the
Intelligence Community. Established in 1961, DIA's primary mission is to
provide all-source intelligence to the US armed forces. Intelligence support
for operational forces encompasses a number of areas and challenges. Key
areas of emphasis include targeting and battle damage assessment, weapons
proliferation, warning of impending crises, support to peacekeeping operations,
maintenance of data bases on foreign military organizations and their equipment
and, as necessary, support to UN operations and US allies. In addition to
providing intelligence to warfighters, DIA has other important customers,
including policymakers in the Department of Defense and members of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Additionally, DIA plays a key role in providing information
on foreign weapons systems to US weapons planners and the weapons acquisition
community. In carrying out these missions, DIA coordinates and synthesizes
military intelligence analysis for Defense officials and military commanders
worldwide, working in close concert with the intelligence components of the
military services and the US unified commands .
Since the end of the Cold War and Desert Shield/Storm, DIA has undergone
dramatic change. Regional priorities have changed, missions and functions
have been realigned, and a strategic plan has been created to reflect new
global realities. Crises in places like Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Rwanda, Iraq
and North Korea, as well as such global challenges as the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, narcotics trafficking, and monitoring
of arms control treaties have increased the scope of demands for intelligence
in the post-Cold War world. To reconcile the disparity between increasing
requirements and declining resources, DIA has relied on a well-trained, highly
motivated work force that has the flexibility and training to face a variety
of new challenges.
Technology has also contributed to DIA's ability to carry out its mission.
New technical intelligence collection systems have provided greater access
to foreign military information. New software and the ability to share data
bases has allowed analysts to contrast, compare, and compile information
quickly and efficiently. Perhaps most importantly, an improved communications
network has enabled efficient, rapid transmission of intelligence to and
from military forces around the globe.
Headed by a three-star military officer, DIA is staffed by civilian and
military personnel. DIA employees are located in several buildings around
the Washington, DC area, but most work at the Defense Intelligence Analysis
Center on Bolling Air Force Base. A small number of employees work at the
Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center in Maryland and the Missile and
Space Intelligence Center in Alabama. DIA's Defense Attaches are assigned
to embassies around the world and DIA liaison officers are assigned to each
unified military command.
Ed's Note: Many people understand that President Kennedy wanted to scatter
to the winds the CIA and assign the responsibilities of that agency to the
defense community but that was before the Trilaleral Commission used the
military to instigate the future wars. Therefore, defense is not defense;
it is aggression.
Additionally, people around the world have determined that the military
bases must leave their country and the American people have expressed that
desire too so we will close those military bases around the world so there
will not be any need for intelligence between the Defense Intelligence Agency
and the bases.
With the internet, we can gather intelligence which is honest information.
We don't need the Defense Intelligence Agency providing disinformation to
people and reserving accurate information to the elites.
If for no other reason than this agency is part of the Shadow Government,
it needs to be disbanded.
