Exactly as predicted, the ongoing French
"intervention" in the North African nation of Mali has spilled into Algeria
- the next most likely objective of Western geopolitical interests in the
region since the successful destabilization of Libya in 2011.
In last week's "France
Displays Unhinged Hypocrisy as Bombs Fall on Mali" report, it was stated
specifically that:
"As far back as August of 2011, Bruce
Riedel out of the corporate-financier funded think-tank, the
Brookings Institution, wrote "Algeria
will be next to fall," where he gleefully predicted success in
Libya would embolden radical elements in Algeria, in particular AQIM.
Between extremist violence and the
prospect of French airstrikes, Riedel hoped to see the fall of the
Algerian government.
Ironically Riedel noted:
Algeria has expressed particular
concern that the unrest in Libya could lead to the development
of a major safe haven and sanctuary for al-Qaeda and other
extremist jihadis.
And thanks to NATO, that is exactly what
Libya has become -
a Western sponsored sanctuary for Al-Qaeda. AQIM's headway in
northern Mali and now French involvement will see the conflict
inevitably spill over into Algeria.
It should be noted that Riedel is a
co-author of "Which
Path to Persia?" which openly
conspires to arm yet another
US State
Department-listed terrorist organization (list as #28), the
Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) to wreak havoc across Iran and help collapse the
government there - illustrating a pattern of using clearly terroristic
organizations, even those listed as so by the US State Department, to
carry out US foreign policy."
Now, it is reported that "Al Qaeda-linked"
terrorists have seized American hostages in Algeria in what is being
described by the Western press as "spill over" from France's Mali
operations.
The Washington Post, in their article, "Al-Qaida-linked
militants seize BP complex in Algeria, take hostages in revenge for Mali,"
claims:
"As Algerian army helicopters clattered
overhead deep in the Sahara desert, Islamist militants hunkered down for
the night in a natural gas complex they had assaulted Wednesday morning,
killing two people and taking dozens of foreigners hostage in what could
be the first spillover from Frances intervention in Mali."
The Wall Street Journal, in its article, "Militants
Grab U.S. Hostages in Algeria," reports that:
"Militants with possible links to al Qaeda
seized about 40 foreign hostages, including several Americans, at a
natural-gas field in Algeria, posing a new level of threat to nations
trying to blunt the growing influence of Islamist extremists in Africa.
As security officials in the U.S. and Europe
assessed options to reach the captives from distant bases, Algerian
security forces failed in an attempt late Wednesday to storm the
facility."
The WSJ also added:
"Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said the
U.S. would take "necessary and proper steps" in the hostage situation,
and didn't rule out military action. He said the Algeria attack could
represent a spillover from Mali."
And it is military action, both covert and
incrementally more overt, that will see the West's extremist proxies and the
West's faux efforts to stem them, increasingly creep over the Mali-Algerian
border, as the old imperial maps of Europe are redrawn right before our
eyes.

French Empire
at its height right before the World Wars.
The
regions that are now Libya, Algeria, Mali, and the Ivory
Coast all face reconquest by the French and
Anglo-Americans, with French troops literally occupying
the region and playing a pivotal role in installing
Western-friendly client regimes.
Also notice Syria too, was a French holding - now under
attack by US-British-French funded, armed, and backed
terrorists - the same terrorists allegedly being fought
in Mali and now Algeria.
Meanwhile,
these very same terrorist forces continue to receive funding, arms,
covert military support, and diplomatic recognition in Syria, by NATO, and
specifically the US and France who are both claiming to fight the "Free
Syrian Army's" ideological and very literal allies in North Africa.
In reality, Al Qaeda is allowing the US and France to intervene and
interfere in Algeria, after attempts in 2011 to trigger political subversion
was soundly defeated by the Algerian government.
Al Qaeda is essentially both a casus belli
and mercenary force, deployed by the West against targeted nations.
It is clear that French operations seek to
trigger armed conflict in Algeria as well as a possible Western military
intervention there as well, with the Mali conflict serving only as a
pretense.
