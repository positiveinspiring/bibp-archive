Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says that US forces are "ready to go"
if the administration decides to strike against alleged Syrian chemical
weapon use.
As Bloomberg notes in the infographic below, US
Navy guided missile destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea are within range of
Syrian targets... and the ships have a combined inventory of more than 200
cruise missiles.
On the other side, the Syrian Air Defense system
is very robust, and as Stratfor notes, with an estimated 54,000 personnel,
Syria's air defense network is twice the size of former
Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi's air force.

As the United States weighs a military response to the Syrian regime's
reported use of chemical weapons, one of the largest concerns will involve
countering Syria's robust air defense network.
With an estimated 54,000 personnel, Syria's air
defense network is twice the size of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's
air force and air defense command combined at the start of the
NATO campaign in 2011.
Syria's Air Defense Command consists of the 24th
and 26th anti-aircraft divisions, which comprise thousands of anti-aircraft
guns and more than 130 surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries.
The bulk of Syria's SAM weaponry is composed of the SA-2, SA-3, SA-5, SA-6
and SA-8 SAM systems, which were also operated by Gadhafi's forces.
However, the Syrians operate these systems in
far greater numbers, have devoted significant resources to maintaining and
upgrading these missile batteries and have also successfully deployed their
SAM systems in a dense and overlapping layout that would complicate
operations to suppress enemy air defenses.
Though also a Russian ally, Gadhafi did not have the more advanced Russian
air defense systems that the al Assad regime possesses.
For example, Iran reportedly financed Syria's
acquisition of 50 SA-22 systems first delivered in 2007 - 10 of which
allegedly ended up in Iranian hands. The Syrians are also thought to operate
several SA-11 systems, which the Libyans did not have.
Syria's defenses against an air campaign are not
restricted to the ground.
Its air force can contribute dozens of fighter
aircraft and interceptors, which any intervention force would also have to
contend with.
