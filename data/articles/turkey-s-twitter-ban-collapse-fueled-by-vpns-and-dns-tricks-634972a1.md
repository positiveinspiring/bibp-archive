# Turkey's Twitter Ban Collapse Fueled by VPNs and DNS Tricks

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_internet183.htm

Friday's news that the Turkish government
had banned its citizens
from accessing Twitter was depressing but an
opportunity to be embraced.
Forewarned is forearmed, and the fact that
Turks are learning
how to beat censorship with VPNs and DNS
tricks
better prepares them for the future.
Two days ago on the campaign trail ahead of
end-of-March elections, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan
showed his Internet naivety by doing something extremely silly.
In the midst of a corruption scandal he
first threatened and then carried through with an outright ban of
Twitter.
"I don't care what the international
community says at all. Everyone will see the power of the Turkish
Republic," Erdogan said on Thursday.
Angry that Twitter did not respond to
requests by Turkish courts to remove material that showed him in a bad
light, Erdogan swung the ban-hammer and by Friday everything was in
place.
Turkish visitors to Twitter were greeted
with notices displayed by their ISPs indicating that Twitter had been
blocked by court order.
"Because there was no other choice,
access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid
the possible future victimization of citizens," Turkish telecoms
watchdog BTK
said on Friday.
What followed was anger from citizens, then
delicious payback against yet another government trying - and ultimately
failing - to artificially restrict access to information on the
Internet.
Rather than bow to Erdogan's wishes, Turkish
citizens reacted in much the same that file-sharers around the world
have done when sites such as The Pirate Bay were blocked by their ISPs.
They took to the open web to spread the word on
how to circumvent web
censorship but in a fresh twist, they also took to the streets
The wonderful image below, ironically
posted to Twitter itself, shows a poster on a Turkish street
explaining how to change DNS settings to obliterate the Twitter ban.
Another photograph, again posted to Twitter,
shows graffiti on a housing block informing people of the IP
addresses used by Google's DNS service rather than the 'infected' ones
offered by local ISPs.
But while these images will be a delight to
anti-censorship advocates everywhere, it was online that the real battle
was taking place.
Here at TF we noticed an unusual level of
interest from Turkish visitors in
our latest VPN article
and then later in the day the effect on VPN takeup was
confirmed by the company behind Hotspot Shield.
AnchorFree CEO David Gorodyansky told
WSJ that 270,000 Turkish users installed their software in one 12
hour period Friday versus around 10,000 on a normal day, a huge increase
by any standards.
TorrentFreak spoke with Andrew Lee at
Private Internet Access who explained that while his company does not
track the identities or locations of its customers, there had definitely
been an uptick in signups following the introduction of Twitter
censorship in Turkey.
"More and more, we are seeing that
censorship is a form of control that the weak use in an attempt to
hang onto power. In addition to Turkey, we can also see this
happening in China, the United Kingdom and other various countries,"
Lee explained.
"Fortunately, the people of this world,
including Turkey, are strong, and democracy will continue to stand.
As such, the attempt to censor Twitter in Turkey has all but
failed."
This article began with the suggestion that
censorship of the type imposed by Turkey is something to be embraced.
Not welcomed, of course, but treated as an opportunity to gain knowledge
on how the Internet works and how web blockades can be circumvented. Those who think they can control the
Internet and people's right to communicate should be made to think again
and in Turkey this week that point has been admirably made.
According to analysis site
Zete.com, tweets in Turkey before the ban numbered 10 million a day
- they now sit at 24 million.
Update:
According to a
local report, Turkey has now appears to have blocked
Google's DNS,
although other sources say that this is an actual network issue.
