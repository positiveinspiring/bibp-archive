# Psychopaths in Charge - Maybe They're Not Human

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_ponerologypsycho07.htm

Dear Humans,
Today I would like to return to your awareness an aspect of the Human
condition that condones violence under certain circumstances.
To this end, we find ourselves going along
with the most egregious of things, not least of which is war. Here we
find not only a consensus of opinion - but an accepted truth. People
kill people. Thats what we do.
People have been killing each other over
borders, religion, ideology, politics and resources as far back as
history will take us.
Its a given that we will continue in this
maniacal cycle of war, truce and temporary peace until our time on this
planet is through. Its our nature and so it is our course and therefore
our destiny! Or is it?
Of course most people are good-natured, loving and kind, but they are
often unaware of some of the more sinister elements in our world.
-
Does our slumber make us a threat to
the survival of humanity?
-
If so, can one surmise that our
"enemy" might actually be the person we see every morning in the
mirror?
-
Are we complicit in some way by
simply being oblivious?
-
Is this what the others mean by "sheeple,"
those who simply go along to get along and never ask probing
questions?
We sit around the proverbial card table and
were handed the rules. We dont really question them.
The rules are the rules and thats that! And
at the end of the night, should one run out of money because the others
understood the rules better, then maybe a moment of truth will beckon.
Perhaps one will decide it is best not to
bother with the rules at all - and instead seek to unmask the rule
maker.
War on Peace
We live in a culture of "political correctness" where people are likely
to become more offended by an off-color remark or a waving middle finger
than by war.
Like with most templates of social order,
political correctness is just another illusion, a construct weve bought
into. Its there to give the impression that society cares. Society does
not care.
We are told warm and fuzzy things to make us
believe we live in a benevolent culture. We do not! We live in
a war culture - we
live in a prison culture and we live in a culture of denial.
Dont believe it? Like I said - denial!
At seventeen a child still needs a note from their mother to be excused
from a day at school. Well thats kind of innocent, warm and fuzzy. Six
months later they just might shove a rifle into his arms, march him to
the front lines and order him to kill.
And when that particular son or daughter
doesnt return home, they say "freedom is not free" and that your child
paid the ultimate price for the wonderful life we so enjoy today. The
wonderful life minus this beautiful child, that is.
Give me a break! I cannot stand the
Orwellian double speak and propaganda, the hypocrisy that spews from the
orifice of the rule maker.
In a war culture you go to "war" on everything. We have the
so-called "war
on terror" which theoretically cannot be beat. It is
impossible to end a war with an "enemy" that is not defined by a border.
And so this war will continue not only on foreign soils, but right here
in the good ol land of the free.
The latest buzz is all about domestic
terrorism. See something, say something. Well Im seeing something
and Im sure trying my best to say something.
We love that word war. We must! We have gone to war on drugs and on
poverty, war on hunger and obesity. Of course lets not forget those
wars fought with battle armor and guns.
We just want to do war on everything, dont
we?
And its sort of strange, really - you see
its not just a U.S. thing or a Russia thing. Its not just the powder
keg we call North Korea or the spiraling tension between Japan and
China. Were all into this war thing.
There are considerable agreements made behind the scenes. Theres
complicity and cooperation on a level that is mind boggling to the newly
awakened.
Let face it, often theres a lot of money to
be made on both sides of the war equation. The opium trade in
Afghanistan is just one example. Business has never been better or more
lucrative since the U.S. loaned its assistance.
War is good business for the handful
that actually benefit from it.
But at what cost?
Psychopaths in
Skin Suits
An online dictionary source defines psychopath as:
"a person with a psychopathic
personality, which manifests as amoral and antisocial behavior, lack
of ability to love or establish meaningful personal relationships,
extreme egocentricity, failure to learn from experience, etc.
Also called sociopath, a person
afflicted with a personality disorder characterized by a tendency to
commit antisocial and sometimes violent acts and a failure to feel
guilt for such acts."
That pretty much sums up whos running our
world.
Are they entirely Human? To be honest, Im
not so certain.
I have difficulty defining the Human species without considering our
remarkable propensity to love and be loved. But there are those that do
not love or care for others and one must wonder just what planet theyre
from.
Perhaps we can generalize and simply
call some people psychopathic. They
might as well be lizards in skin suits so far as Im concerned. To call
them Human seems a stretch indeed.
But they walk the walk and talk the talk. We
get tricked by these tricksters - theyre good at their game and they
know it.
Theyve had plenty of time to really get it
all honed down good and tight.
The Rule Makers
Back in the 1960s when the so-called counter culture or "hippie
generation" emerged onto the scene, many began to question whether what
they were told about the JFK and Dr. King assassinations was true.
The Vietnam War only served to galvanize
this awakening. Back in those days, news outside the mainstream channels
came mainly through relatively obscure articles, books and by
word-of-mouth. The energy of this movement was captured in a big way,
however, through the music of that era.
We dont have Janis Joplin anymore,
but we do have
the Internet, and this has greatly
contributed to a mass awakening and the unstoppable momentum of the
"truth movement."
People who "run" the world do not
necessarily have any allegiance to a particular country or party, yet
they make decisions based on their one-world governmental view that
affects you and me on a daily basis.
Where do they get their power? Well,
ultimately their power comes from their ability to manage all of us.
And where are the clergy? Why have they not been calling for an end to
all the rampant bloodshed in these trying times?
Thats right- theyre not allowed to discuss
politics. It violates their
501(c)(3) pact with the government.
Thats another way of saying theyre taking "hush money."
Dont talk about war and politics - and get
a nice little break from the taxman. This gig is rigged! Say one thing
and do another - thats the name of the game.
Theyll preach platitudes of love and peace
but theyll never preach the horrors of war and bring the message to the
street.
Final Thought
In 1988, director John Carpenter released a film entitled, "They
Live."
It follows a drifter referred to as "Nada,"
who discovers that the so-called ruling classes were in fact malevolent
entities masquerading as Human.
They manipulate people into spending money,
breeding and accepting the status quo through the constant bombardment
of subliminal messages via mass media. Some might feel this was more of
a documentary than a sci-fi thriller.
The film is famously remembered for its five-and-half minute alley fight
between the actor that was able to "see" these entities (Roddy Piper)
and the actor that would not see (Keith David) because he wasnt willing
to put on the special glasses that permitted this ability.
Carpenter drags the brutal fight scene out
for an almost comical duration.
After watching the scene, I realized he was
really trying to convey the frustration and difficulty involved in
trying to wake up a fellow Human. Just put on the damn glasses and
take a look! Nope - wont do it!
A musician friend of mine whose band saw considerable success in the
late 1960s always ends his conversations by saying, "keep it real."
Keep it real! Well thats what I try to do. But it just isnt always
that easy.
There are unseen forces at work trying
desperately to keep us apart and in the dark. The tension building in
Russia is yet another chapter waiting to explode. It might even be the
final one. Never has there been a more urgent time for the Human race to
start behaving as "Humans" again.
We need to pull the rubber masks off those
who claim to be serving us and realize they would rather "serve us" with
a sprig of parsley and mash potatoes on the side.
Are these people Human?
Those who feed off of war and profit from
death and destruction seem to fit rather nicely in that shape-shifting,
lizard category Id say. So who are they - what are they? Thats a
question I continue to debate.
On the plus side, this awakening movement
keeps getting stronger by the day. Im optimistic that despite some of
the more grim forecasts out there, we still have a pretty decent chance
of turning our situation around.
It only takes a motivated, three percent of
any population to effect major changes in policy and direction.
I think were nearly there.
