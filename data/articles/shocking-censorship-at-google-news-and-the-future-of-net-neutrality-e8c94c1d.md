For those of you who want to know what the Internet will end up like when
the Comcast, AT&T, Verizon and Time Warner interests take it over, you need
to look at this shocking new case of censorship by Google News.
The
recent federal court ruling in favor of censorship on the part of Internet
companies representing the interests of the Business Roundtable - Comcast,
AT&T, Verizon and Time Warner - is a serious threat to the dissemination of
critical information vital to the functioning of our democracy.
The consolidation of media companies that has
occurred in traditional media outlets, such as newspapers, radio and
television, has led to the strategic dumbing down of the U.S. population.
Under tight control by the most powerful corporations on the planet, U.S.
mainstream media has become an omnipresent propaganda system designed to
divide, distract, confuse and create apathy among the U.S. populace.
In the process, mainstream corporate controlled
media has obscured, isolated and suppressed dissent and understanding of our
present ruling class.
The Internet has emerged as a vital countervailing force to powerful
interests who seek to undermine the founding ideals of our country and
further impoverish an unsuspecting middle class of hardworking Americans.
Thanks to the tireless hard work of citizen
journalists (bloggers) across the political spectrum, a growing number of
American citizens have become informed and engaged to a level not seen since
the pamphleteers enlightened the citizenry and sparked the first American
Revolution.
Those of us who have spent many hours working on this - often very hard
unpaid work, yet vital and rewarding - task of exposing corruption and abuse
at the highest levels of power, must remain vigilant, and not be na√Øve to
the growing forces of power who seek to silence our First Amendment rights
by controlling the Internet, just as they have controlled all previous
mediums of mass communication.
I speak as someone who has already had firsthand experience in censorship.
When we first created our news site
AmpedStatus.com, we spent a considerable
amount of time filling out a form requested by Google News, to get our news
site listed in their search results.
We carefully worded and submitted our
information to meet Googles requirements.
However, after waiting several
days, we received a form email stating that our request had been denied.
Unlike Rupert Murdoch, who obviously has no understanding of how the
Internet works, I know it is vital to get listed on Google News.
(Note to Stupert Murdoch: Not getting listed on Google News is like not having your
newspapers displayed on newsstands.)
So right from the start, I knew my work at AmpedStatus would have a hard
time reaching a wide audience due to Googles rejection (censorship).
We then decided to put much effort and our
limited resources into Search Engine Optimization. At least we could
maximize Googles general search results. However, when I released my report
The Critical Unraveling of U.S. Society, Google blocked it from appearing
in their general search results.
I wrote a brief post about Google censoring my
report and tried to contact Google several times but never got a response.
Thankfully, after I had submitted my emails of complaint and many other
sites had picked up the report - well over a million people had read it -
the report suddenly reappeared in their search results.
Knowing Googles apparent desire to censor our work, I was thankful to have
sites across the Internet which were willing to publish them. A key ally in
our attempts to overcome censorship is the news site,
The Public Record.
On a personal level, they have published all my
recent reports. (How ironic that a site called The Public Record has come to
our aid.)
Shocking Censorship at
Google News
One of the great things about The Public Record is that it is listed in
Google News search results.
So, even though we were censored, we have been
able to still get our work listed in this vital online newsstand. However,
the
powers-that-be at Google seem to have caught on to the fact that
The
Public Record is publishing our work. My latest report is the first report
that The Public Record has ever had removed from Google News search results.
This is obviously a case a selective censorship!
Jason Leopold, editor at large of The Public Record, writes:
It appears that Google News has deprived
the public of important information by censoring this story. This is the
first time since Google News began carrying The Public Record that we
have ever experienced a blackout on one of our articles.
We have tried,
unsuccessfully, to contact Google for an explanation. If this is in fact
the case, if Google did indeed censor this story because of its subject
matter, then Google has acted no different than the Chinese government.
Rory OConnor, co-founder of
MediaChannel,
adds:
This from a company that just shutdown its
operations in China because it no longer wanted to censor news and
information?
I have repeatedly reported, in detail, with
ample evidence and supporting material/links to back up my claims, that the
US government, tax system, economy, stock market and Federal Reserve have
been seized by an organized criminal operation that is tactically destroying
middle class America.
I am fully aware that these claims may sound
extreme to Americans who have been subjected to the omnipresent mainstream
media (propaganda) system. However, those of us who use the Internet as our
primary means of research and analysis know that the evidence supporting
this claim is overwhelming and could be proven in court given the
opportunity.
In fact, I believe that it is my clear presentation of this evidence that
has led to Googles censorship of this report.
So for all of you who wonder
what the Internet may end up looking like when the Comcast, AT&T, Verizon
and Time Warner (all members of the Business Roundtable) interests take it
over, you need to only look at the actions of Google News in censoring my
call for a movement to restore democracy and the rule of law.
When the Constitution of the United States was written, the
FIRST AMENDMENT,
not the second, third, fourth or fifth, but the FIRST AMENDMENT stated this:
Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the
people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a
redress of grievances.
With this in mind, please consider reading the
report that Google News has censored:
Is It Time for Law Abiding American Citizens to
Stop Paying Their Taxes and Start a New Government?
