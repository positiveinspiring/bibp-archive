# The United States Isn't a Country - It's a Corporation!

The date is February 21, 1871 and the Forty-First Congress is
in session.
I refer you to the "Acts of the Forty-First Congress,"
Section 34, Session III, chapters 61 and 62. On this date in the history of
our nation, Congress passed an Act titled: "An Act To Provide A Government
for the District of Columbia."
This is also known as the "Act of 1871."
What does this mean? Well, it means that Congress, under no
constitutional authority to do so, created a separate form of government for
the District of Columbia, which is a ten mile square parcel of land.
What??? How could they do that? Moreover, WHY would they do
that? To explain, let's look at the circumstances of those days. The Act of
1871 was passed at a vulnerable time in America. Our nation was essentially
bankrupt - weakened and financially depleted in the aftermath of the Civil
War.
The Civil War itself was nothing more than a calculated
"front" for some pretty fancy footwork by corporate backroom players. It was
a strategic maneuver by European interests (the international bankers) who
were intent upon gaining a stranglehold on the neck (and the coffers) of
America.
The Congress realized our country was in dire financial
straits, so they cut a deal with the international bankers - (in those days,
the Rothschilds of London were dipping
their fingers into everyone's pie) thereby incurring a DEBT to said bankers.
If we think about banks, we know they do not just lend us money out of the
goodness of their hearts. A bank will not do anything for you unless it is
entirely in their best interest to do so.
There has to be some sort of collateral or some string
attached which puts you and me (the borrower) into a subservient position.
This was true back in 1871 as well.
The conniving international bankers were not about to lend
our floundering nation any money without some serious stipulations.
So, they
devised a brilliant way of getting their foot in the door of the United
States (a prize they had coveted for some time, but had been unable to grasp
thanks to our Founding Fathers, who despised them and held them in check),
and thus, the Act of 1871 was passed.
In essence, this Act formed the corporation known as THE
UNITED STATES. Note the capitalization, because it is important. This
corporation, owned by foreign interests, moved right in and shoved the
original "organic" version of the Constitution into a dusty corner.
With the "Act of 1871," our Constitution was defaced in the
sense that the title was block-capitalized and the word "for" was changed to
the word "of" in the title.
The original Constitution drafted by the Founding Fathers,
was written in this manner:
"The Constitution for the united states of America".
The altered version reads:
"THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA".
It is the corporate constitution. It is NOT the same document
you might think it is.
The corporate constitution operates in an economic capacity
and has been used to fool the People into thinking it is the same parchment
that governs the Republic. It absolutely is not.
Capitalization - an insignificant change? Not when one is
referring to the context of a legal document, it isn't. Such minor
alterations have had major impacts on each subsequent generation born in
this country. What the Congress did with the passage of the Act of 1871 was
create an entirely new document, a constitution for the government of the
District of Columbia. The kind of government THEY created was a corporation.
The new, altered Constitution serves as the constitution of
the corporation, and not that of America. Think about that for a moment.
Incidentally, this corporate constitution does not benefit
the Republic. It serves only to benefit the corporation. It does nothing
good for you or me - and it operates outside of the original Constitution.
Instead of absolute rights guaranteed under the "organic" Constitution, we
now have "relative" rights or privileges.
One example of this is the Sovereign's right to travel, which
has been transformed under corporate government policy into a "privilege"
which we must be licensed to engage in. This operates outside of the
original Constitution.
So, Congress committed TREASON against the People, who were
considered Sovereign under the Declaration of Independence and the organic
Constitution. When we consider the word "Sovereign," we must think about
what the word means.
According to Webster's Dictionary, "sovereign" is defined as:
-
chief or highest; supreme.
-
Supreme in power, superior in position to all others.
-
Independent of, and unlimited by, any other,
possessing or entitled to, original and independent authority or
jurisdiction.
In other words, our government was created by and for
"sovereigns" - the free citizens who were deemed the highest authority.
Only the People can be sovereign - remember that. Government
cannot be sovereign. We can also look to the Declaration of Independence,
where we read: "government is subject to the consent of the governed" -
that's supposed to be us, the sovereigns.
Do you feel like a sovereign nowadays? I don't.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist or a constitutional
historian to figure out that this is not what is happening in our country
today. Government in these times is NOT subject to the consent of the
governed.
Rather, the governed are subject to the whim and greed of the
corporation, which has stretched its tentacles beyond the ten-mile-square
parcel of land known as the District of Columbia - encroaching into every
state of the Republic. Mind you, the corporation has NO jurisdiction outside
of the District of Columbia. THEY just want you to think it does.
You see, you are presumed to know the law. This is ironic
because as a people, we are taught basically nothing about the law in
school. We are made to memorize obscure factoids and paragraphs here and
there, such as the Preamble, and they gloss over the Bill of Rights. But we
are not told about the law. Nor do our corporate government schools delve
into the Constitution in any great depth.
After all, they were put into place to indoctrinate and dumb
down the masses - not to teach us anything.
We were not told that we were sold-out to foreign interests
and made beneficiaries of the debt incurred by Congress to the international
bankers. For generations, American citizens have had the bulk of their
earnings confiscated to pay on a massive debt that they, as a People, did
not incur. There are many, many things the People have not been told.
How do you feel about being made a beneficiary of somebody
else's massive debt without your knowledge or consent? Are we going to keep
going along with this??
When you hear some individuals say that the Constitution is
null and void, think about how our government has transformed over time from
a municipal or service-oriented entity to a corporate or profit-oriented
entity. We are living under the myth that this is lawful, but it is not. We
are being ruled by a "de facto," or unlawful, form of government - the
corporate body of the death-mongers - The Controllers.
With the passage of the Act of 1871, a series of subtle and
overt deceptions were set in motion - all in conjunction and collusion with
the Congress, who knowingly and deliberately sold the People down the river.
Did they tell you this in government school? I doubt it. They
were too busy drumming the fictional version of history into your brain -
and mine. By failing to disclose what THEY did to the American People, the
people became ignorant of what was happening. Over time, the Republic took
it on the chin to the point of a knockdown.
With the surrender of their gold in 1933, the People
essentially surrendered their law.
I don't suppose you were taught THAT in
school either. That's because our REAL history is hidden from us. This is
the way Roman Civil Law works - and our form of governance today is based
upon Roman Civil Law and Admiralty/Maritime Law - better known as the
"Divine Right of Kings" and "Law of the Seas", respectively. This explains a
lot.
Roman Civil Law was fully established in the original
colonies even before our nation began and is also known as private
international law.
The government which was created for the District of Columbia
via the Act of 1871 operates under Private International Law, and not Common
Law, which was the law of the Constitutional Republic. This is very
important to note since it impacts all Americans in concrete ways. You must
recognize that private international law is only applicable within the
District of Columbia and NOT in the other states of the Union.
The various arms of the corporation are known as
"departments" such as the Judiciary, Justice and Treasury. You recognize
those names? Yes, you do! But they are not what you assume them to be.
These "departments" all belong to the corporation known as
THE UNITED STATES. They do NOT belong to you and me under the corporate
constitution and its various amendments that operate outside of the
Constitutional Republic.
I refer you to the UNITED STATES CODE (note the
capitalization, indicating the corporation, not the Republic) Title 28 3002
(15) (A) (B) (C). It is stated unequivocally that the UNITED STATES is a
corporation [see note].
Realize, too, that the corporation is not a separate and distinct entity
from the government. It IS the government. YOUR government.
This is extremely important. I refer to this as the
"corporate empire of the UNITED STATES," which operates under Roman Civil
Law outside of the Constitution. How do you like being ruled by a cheesy,
sleazy corporation? You'll ask your Congressperson about this, you say? HA!!
Congress is fully aware of this deception. You must be made
aware that the members of Congress do NOT work for you and me. Rather, they
work for the Corporation known as THE UNITED STATES. Is this really any
surprise to you? This is why we can't get them to do anything on our behalf
or to answer to us - as in the case with the illegal income tax - among many
other things.
Contrary to popular belief, they are NOT our civil servants.
They do NOT work for us. They are the servants of the corporate government
and carry out its bidding. Period.
The great number of committees and sub-committees that the
Congress has created all work together like a multi-headed monster to
oversee the various corporate "departments." And, you should know that every
single one of these that operates outside the District of Columbia is in
violation of the law.
The corporate government of the UNITED STATES has no
jurisdiction or authority in ANY state of the Republic beyond the District
of Columbia.
Let this sink into your brain for a minute.
Ask yourself,
"Could this deception REALLY have occurred without the
full knowledge and complicity of the Congress?"
Do you think it happened by accident? You are deceiving
yourself if you do. There are no accidents or coincidences. It is time to
confront the truth and awaken from ignorance.
Your legislators will not apprise you of this information.
You are presumed to know the law. THEY know you don't know the law, or your
history for that matter, because this information has not been taught to
you. No concerted effort has been made to inform you.
As a Sovereign, you are entitled to full disclosure of the
facts. As a slave, you are entitled to nothing other than what the
corporation decides to "give" you - at a price. Be wary of accepting
so-called "benefits" of the corporation of the UNITED STATES. Aren't you
enslaved enough already?
I said (above) that you are presumed to know the law. Still,
it matters not if you don't in the eyes of the corporation. Ignorance of the
law is not considered an excuse. It is your responsibility and your
obligation as an American to learn about the law and how it applies to you.
THEY count on the fact that most people are too uninterested or distracted
or lazy to do so.
The People have been mentally conditioned to allow the
alleged government to do their thinking for them. We need to turn that
around if we are to save our Republic before it is too late.
The UNITED STATES government is basically a corporate
instrument of the international bankers. This means YOU are owned by the
corporation from birth to death. The corporate UNITED STATES also holds
ownership of all your assets, your property, and even your children.
Does
this sound untrue?
Think long and hard about all those bills you pay, all those
various taxes and fines and licenses you must pay for. Yes, they've got you
by the pockets. Actually, they've had you by the ass for as long as you've
been alive. In your heart, you know it's true. Don't believe any of this?
Read up on the 14th Amendment.
Check out how "free" you really are.
With the Act of 1871 and subsequent legislation such as the
purportedly ratified 14th Amendment, our once-great nation of Sovereigns has
been subverted from a Republic to a democracy. As is the case under Roman
Civil Law, our ignorance of the facts has led to our silence. Our silence
has been construed as our consent to become beneficiaries of a debt we did
not incur.
The Sovereign People have been deceived for hundreds of years
into thinking they remain free and independent, when in actuality we
continue to be slaves and servants of the corporation.
Treason was committed against the People in 1871 by the
Congress. This could have been corrected through the decades by some honest
men (assuming there were some), but it was not, mainly due to lust for money
and power. Nothing new there.
Are we to forgive and justify this crime against the People?
You have lost more freedom than you may realize due to corporate
infiltration of the so-called government. We will lose more unless we turn
away from a democracy that is the direct road to disaster - and restore our
Constitutional Republic.
In an upcoming article, we'll take a closer look at the
purportedly ratified 14th Amendment and how we became "property" of the
corporation and enslaved by our silence.
I am saddened to think about the brave men and women who were
killed in all the wars and conflicts instigated by the Controllers. These
courageous souls fought for the preservation of ideals they believed to be
true - not for the likes of a corporation.
Do you believe that any one of the individuals who have been
killed as a result of war would have willingly fought if they knew the full
truth? Do you think one person would have laid down his life for a
corporation? I think not.
If the People had known long ago to what extent their trust
had been betrayed, I wonder how long it would have taken for another
Revolution. What we need is a Revolution in THOUGHT. We change our thinking
and we change our world.
