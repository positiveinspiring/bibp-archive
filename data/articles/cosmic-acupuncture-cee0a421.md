Cosmic
Acupuncture
(CAC General reading, April 12, 1980-Reprinted from issue
80-16)
Assisting in an
alchemical action of draining off the polarized magnetic energy fields
This Awareness indicates that those
entities who have listened to these messages last year, and again this year,
have assisted in an alchemical action of draining off the polarized magnetic
energy fields associated with war and balancing out those energies. This Awareness
indicates that each time an entity becomes aware of a polarization which is
imbalanced; and each time the entity seeks to reconcile those imbalanced polarizations,
the polarities involved in consciousness become released.
The healing is
allowed to take place
This Awareness indicates this as
likened unto acupuncture or acupressure on a human form, whereby an illness
may be caused by a collection of energy that does not flow properly because
of a block in a particular area; and when this area is stimulated, pushed
or poked, according to whatever method is used-acupressure, acupuncture,
or massage--the energies then begin to flow, and the healing is allowed to
take place
