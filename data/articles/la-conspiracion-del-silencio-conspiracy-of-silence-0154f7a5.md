Conspiracy Of Silence
Banned Discovery Channel Documentary

"Conspiracy of Silence" is a
powerful, disturbing documentary revealing a nationwide
child abuse and pedophilia ring that leads to
the highest levels of
government.
Featuring intrepid
investigator John DeCamp, a highly decorated Vietnam war
veteran and 16-year Nebraska state senator, "Conspiracy
of Silence" reveals how rogue elements at all levels of
government have been involved in systematic child abuse
and pedophilia
to feed the base desires of
key politicians...
Based on DeCamp's riveting book,
The Franklin Cover-up, "Conspiracy of
Silence" begins with the shut-down of
Nebraska's Franklin Community Federal
Credit Union after a raid by federal agencies in November 1988 revealed that
$40 million was missing.
When the Nebraska legislature launched a probe into
the affair, what initially looked like a financial swindle soon exploded
into a startling tale of drugs, money laundering, and a nationwide child
abuse ring. Nineteen months later, the legislative committee's chief
investigator died suddenly and violently, like more than a dozen other
people linked to the Franklin case.
So why have you never heard of the Franklin cover-up?
Originally scheduled
to air in May of 1994 on the Discovery Channel, "Conspiracy of Silence" was
yanked at the last minute due to formidable pressure applied by top
politicians. Some very powerful people did not want you to watch this
documentary.
You may find yourself becoming angry or upset while watching "Conspiracy of
Silence." Many people do.
However, consider that each of us has at times in
our life acted out of selfish motives when it comes to sexuality and ended
up hurting others in one way or another. Let us take this information not
only as a call to stop this kind of abuse at the nationwide level, but also
as a call to examine our own sexual relationships and make a commitment to
deep honesty and integrity in our own lives around this most sensitive
issue.
Thanks for caring and may we all work together to build a brighter
future for ourselves and for our world.
A copy of this videotape was furnished anonymously to former Nebraska state
senator and attorney John De Camp who made it available to retired FBI Agent
Ted L. Gunderson. While the video quality is not top grade, this tape is a
blockbuster in what is revealed by the participants involved.
NOTE
This film had to be reassembled from remaining VHS fragments after an
all-out effort was made to block the films release and destroy all extant
copies. Every effort has been made to restore it to the original and
complete "meant to be broadcast" version.
