I have no personal experience in the
business of false flag terrorism, but I imagine that engineering
a successfully staged terror attack to be blamed on innocent or
semi-innocent parties with the goal of psychologically manipulating a
population requires that one also be an accomplished storyteller.
It demands
an avid imagination and an organized sense of foresight.
And, most of all, it requires a consistency of
narrative. Without consistency, the audiences ability to suspend its
disbelief is damaged, and they become disconnected from the fantasy being
portrayed.
If I were the writer behind the story of the Boston Marathon Bombing, I
would consider my efforts an abject failure.
The narrative of the event has changed multiple times in only a few days,
following a hailstorm of conflicting observations from the government and
the establishment-run media.
The villain of the original plotline was
clearly meant to be rightwing extremism as numerous mainstream talking
heads, led by federal agency inferences, began repeating the homegrown
right wing terrorist meme everywhere.
This meme was partly abandoned after the
alternative media and the Liberty Movement began its own investigation,
revealing a large federal presence on the scene, including military Civil
Support Teams often tied to
the DHS and
Northcom, as well as the witnesses
who observed what on-scene officials called training exercises during the
marathon.
I have no doubt that these citizen
investigations forced the establishment to change the direction of their
crime tale, and use Plan B patsies instead. This, however, complicated the
momentum of the fiction, and created even more questions.
The Chechen brothers now implicated in the attack have been revealed as long
time
FBI contacts.
This is a bit awkward for the FBI considering
they asked the American public to help them identify the suspects in
on-scene photos while they failed to mention that they knew EXACTLY who the
two young men were already (this is what we might call a contrived story
arch).
Today, the older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev,
is conveniently dead. The younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had his
throat conveniently shot out.
The feds are now supplying the media with
written confessions from Dzhokhar to which there is no proof of
legitimacy. For all we know the boy hasnt written a word.
The new villains get no voice in this drama, and thus become two
dimensional characters. They exist so that we can hate them. Understanding
them, or hearing their side of events from their own lips, is certainly out
of the question. Poorly fleshed out antagonists are a sure sign of a poorly
constructed story.
Finally, we get to the heroes.
Though the criminal elements of our federal
government and adjoining alphabet agencies did not yet get the right wing
patriot patsy they obviously wanted, they have still so far gleaned
considerable social capital from the bombings.
The point of a false flag is
to frighten the population of any given nation into relinquishing freedom in
the name of safety, which in the process gives the central government even
more control.
In the wake of the Boston attack, the
establishment is having a field day
Martial Law
Conditioning
For a few days, Boston became an Orwellian nightmare.
The city lockdown and subsequent militarization
was swift, though any intelligent and guilty suspect could have easily left
the area before hand. This kind of response to catch only two supposed
perpetrators is outlandish, unless you understand that it was not about
catching the bombers.
Rather, it was an exercise designed to test the
malleability of the American people during a crisis scenario.
In Watertown, residents were not only
forced into lockdown; they were also subjected to house-to-house searches
without warrant, pat downs, and numerous other violations of their 4th
Amendment rights.
Take note that almost everything you see in the
video below is an illegal and unconstitutional action on the part of Boston
authorities:
As this was occurring, officials were
consistently pushing media cameras away from the area in the name of
safety, even though media cameramen are sent into domestic shootouts and
foreign warzones on a regular basis.
The only real purpose that I can see to removing
them from the scene was to reduce the amount of video footage depicting
these illegal searches and seizures:
For those who cant grasp what has happened here, let me explain; the
dynamics of liberty have just been erased.
This kind of behavior on the part of government
will not be limited to disasters like Boston, or New Orleans during Katrina;
a precedence is being set to use martial law-style tactics anywhere for any
reason at anytime. The national security argument is being used as a free
license to institute any measure regardless of law to achieve a particular
combat objective.
The environment we saw in the dark days of Boston is an
environment well soon see all over the country, and here is why
Escalation
Boston represents a clear escalation of
the use of NDAA and
martial law
measures in the aftermath of a security event.
After the arrest of Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev, who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2012, his
Miranda Rights
under the Constitution were denied due to,
extraneous circumstances of
national security.
Numerous lawmakers called for the suspect to be treated
as an enemy combatant so that he could be interrogated under the laws of
war without due process.
The Obama White House has
cleverly called for a civilian trial of Tsarnaev
in order to reduce criticisms of its support for numerous unconstitutional
measures, including the NDAA and the use of assassination against American
citizens.
The White House has always claimed that it would not use the
combatant provisions against American citizens, but has never denied that
those provisions could be applied to us. The idea is that while the
president does have these powers at his disposal, were supposed to have
faith that he will not abuse them.
During the debate over the passage of
the NDAA, Obama opposed certain language within the legislation that
REQUIRED him to treat accused domestic terrorists as enemy combatants, not
because he thought it was wrong, or unconstitutional, but because he wanted
the OPTION to decide whether he would or would not black bag a citizen and
throw him into an unspecified hole.
He has simply exercised his option for
a citizen trial, at least this time around
In the meantime, a simultaneous and so far poorly verified train attack
has been averted in Canada, opening the door for more discussion on
something the establishment has been trying to squeeze out of the populace
for years: consent for the federalized lockdown of travel and public events.
Whether through TSA, or the use of state
authorities under the watch of the DHS, the government has been desperately
clamoring to expand the control grid out of airports and federal buildings
into the
bus stations, subways, trains, highways and
sidewalks of America.
I believe that we will soon see much greater presence of TSA VIPR teams at
large public arenas and in transportation venues outside of airports, and
that the Boston Bombing will be used as a primer for this expansion.
Recent
comments by NY Mayor Michael Bloomberg only reinforce my belief.
Bloomberg,
in reference to the marathon attack, stated that:
we live in a complex world where youre going to have to have a level of
security greater than you did back in the olden days, if you will. And our
laws and our interpretation of the Constitution, I think, have to change.
Look, we live in a very dangerous world. We know there are people who want
to take away our freedoms. New Yorkers probably know that as much if not
more than anybody else after the terrible
tragedy of 9/11
We have to understand that in the world going forward, were going to have
more cameras and that kind of stuff. Thats good in some sense, but its
different from what we are used to
Ironically, the only enemy out there that appears ready to take our
freedoms away are men like Bloomberg; snakes in the grass that pay lip
service to the Constitution while constantly trying to undermine it.
Free Speech Is Next
The bombings in Boston took place, apparently by coincidence, just before
Oath Keepers, a national organization of current serving military, police
officers, and veterans promoting adherence to their constitutional oath was
to hold a large rally at Lexington Green.
The Lexington Green board, one
member of which had been openly hostile to Oath Keepers in the past, decided
to use the crisis as an excuse to deny the rally permit already attained by
the liberty minded group.
The Lexington Selectmen claimed that under the suggestions of state
officials the rally had to be cancelled due to the lack of police
available to secure the area and ensure public safety.
However, when Oath Keepers held a brief oath
ceremony at the Green in protest of the decision, a
police force was sent to watch them.
This means that public safety was not the issue. Rather, safety and security
were being used yet again to deny a constitutional right, and this time it
was the most vital and valuable right of all - free speech.
During the height of the civil rights marches of the 50s and 60s, the
exact same tactics were used to silence dissent.
Black protesters were told that they could
not obtain proper permits for peaceful marches because their own safety
and the safety of the public could not be ensured. This matter of using
broad hypothetical dangers as a catalyst for censorship was finally argued
before the Supreme Court in
Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham.
The court sided with the protestors, pointing
out that the use of undefined safety concerns and prior restraint to
silence speech was unconstitutional. Unfortunately, the decision has not
prevented the U.S. government from slowly undermining public protest rights
ever since.
The fascinating thing about
incremental tyranny is the way in which naïve
members of our society try to rationalize it.
They debate using logical fallacies like:
How have your rights been violated in
particular? If your rights havent been violated, what right do you have
to complain?
And how about this gem
Yeah, there are problems in this country,
but at least we have some freedom. In many countries, you wouldnt be
allowed to complain the way you are
This is statist psychology at work.
Freedom, in their minds, is a privilege doled
out by governments, rather than an inborn attribute outside of the realm of
law. They do not understand that the violation of the rights of one American
is a violation of the rights of ALL Americans. They do not understand that
the destruction of some constitutional protections will one day lead to the
destruction of ALL constitutional protections.
The establishment and the useful idiots they manipulate want to make the
threat the center of attention, but ultimately, the threat is irrelevant.
There will always be the danger of terrorism and death. Always!
And, if our government is following
the
Operation Gladio false flag model (look it up, folks, it was openly admitted
government funded terrorism), as I believe they are, then we can count on
Boston-style bombings all over the U.S. very soon.
True crisis lay in what we refuse to see, and the greatest crisis today is
not the bombing of a marathon, but the destruction of our freedoms in the
name of security.
The bottom line? Our civil liberties are not up for
compromise. Period.
Shootings, bombs, nukes, nothing! There is no
rationalization that will ever make tyranny a moral enterprise. I, like many
other Americans, do not care what boogeyman fantasy is paraded in front of
me. We are not frightened, and we are not ignorant.
No attack, no matter how heinous, will ever
convince us to hand over our freedom.
