The second most powerful man in Nazi Germany,
Martin Bormann, was a "Soviet" (i.e. Illuminati) agent who ensured the
destruction of both Germany and European Jewry.
Thus, he advanced two of the Illuminati's main goals:
-
integrate Germany into
a world government by annihilating its national, cultural and racial
pretensions
-
establish Israel as the Masonic banker's
world capital by threatening European Jews with extermination
The Illuminati are a loose alliance of Jewish finance and the
British/America/European aristocracy joined by marriage, money and belief in
the occult (Freemasonry).
Winston Churchill, a Freemason whose mother was
Jewish, fits this description.
They own vast interlocking cartels (banking, oil, pharmaceuticals, war,
chemicals, minerals, media etc.) and control society and government through
corporate and professional groups,
the media, education,
secret societies,
think tanks, foundations and intelligence agencies. Their goal is "to absorb
the world's wealth" (in Cecil Rhodes' words) and control its citizens using
propaganda, "education" and social engineering.
Nations (Britain, US, Israel) movements (Zionism, Socialism, Nazism,
Communism) and people (Americans, Germans, Jews) are their pawns to be
sacrificed to their demented megalomaniac scheme for global dictatorship.
Bormann's career illustrates how they orchestrate wars to advance this
long-term objective.
Martin Bormann (1900-?) was the organizer, treasurer and paymaster of the
Nazi Party and controlled its powerful machine. He was the contact with
Illuminati bankers and industrialists who financed the Nazi Party and
donated millions to Hitler. As Deputy Fuhrer and Hitler's Secretary, Bormann
signed Hitler's paycheck and managed his accounts. He determined whom and
what Hitler saw, and acted in his name.
Goering said,
"Bormann stayed with Hitler day and night
and gradually brought him so much under his will that he ruled Hitler's
whole existence."
("Martin Bormann" by James McGovern,
p.160)
Hitler made Bormann the Executor of his will.
Bormann, not Hitler, owned
the Berghof.
"The entire complex on the Obersalzberg,
consisting of 87 buildings and worth over one and a half million marks,
was legally registered in Bormann's name."
(McGovern, p.128)
In 1972 Gen. Reinhard Gehlen (head of Wehrmacht
Soviet Intelligence) revealed that Bormann had been a Soviet spy, a view
shared by many top Nazi generals and officials including Gottlob Berger, a
SS Lieutenant General who knew Bormann well.
"Bormann did the greatest harm of anyone,"
Berger testified at Nuremberg.
(McGovern, 181)
The implications are staggering.
Remember what
Winston Churchill said.
"This war is not against Hitler or National
Socialism but against the strength of the German people, which is to be
smashed once and for all, regardless whether it is in the hands of
Hitler or a Jesuit priest."
(Emrys Hughes, Winston Churchill, His
Career in War and Peace p. 145)
The Nazi Party was created, and the Second World
War staged in order to lead the German people into a diabolical trap, after
fatally compromising them morally.
In "The Bormann Brotherhood" (1972) William Stevenson says Bormann,
"gave the lowest priority to the fate of
Germany... He was concerned instead with a future based on Nazi
philosophy, financed by Nazi loot, supported by a personally loyal
Brotherhood..."
(62)
Is this the
New World Order?
It is possible that the next world war also will be staged, this time to
undermine the United States.
BORMANN
It is unlikely that Bormann perished in war-torn
Berlin, as
the Illuminati would like us to believe.
A man who carefully prepared for the
survival of the Reich by setting up 750 corporations in neutral
countries would have provided for his own escape. There have been
reports that the Russians rescued Bormann and set him up in Moscow.
Other reports placed him in South America. Adolph Eichmann's eldest son,
Horst claimed he had many conversations with him in Argentina.
(McGovern, p.194)
Obviously Bormann was working for both the
Soviets and the Nazis, i.e. he was working for the Illuminati.
Two-time
Pulitzer Prize winner Louis Kilzer makes the case that Bormann was a
"Soviet" spy in his book "Hitler's
Traitor" (2000). He examined the wire traffic between the spy
known as "Werther" and Moscow and determined that only Bormann had access to
this information.
Bormann told Hitler he wanted a record for posterity and
had stenographers transcribe Hitler's war conferences.
The Soviets were able to ask very detailed questions about Nazi defenses and
intentions. The result was the decisive Nazis defeats at Stalingrad and
Kursk.
"Bormann had been as useful to Russia as
fifty Red Army divisions," Kilzer writes.
(61)
"His value to Stalin began early. In 1941, when Germany could have used
millions of Ukrainian nationalists to defeat Soviet rule, Bormann
decided that they deserved only, 'enslavement and depopulation.'
...Faced with ... genocide by the Germans or political domination by the
Soviets, the Ukrainians chose to live and by so doing ruined German
hopes for an easy conquest."
(261)
Borman used the Nazi defeat at Stalingrad as an
excuse to begin the extermination of Jews, the second Illuminati goal.
In the words of the Nuremberg prosecutor, Bormann was a,
"prime mover in the program of starvation,
degradation, spoliation and extermination."
He shielded Hitler from the grisly details,
forbidding Himmler from discussing the subject with Hitler and filing
Himmler's reports.
(261)
"Bormann's role with the Ukrainians and the
Jews was only part of his devastating effect on the Third Reich," Kilzer
writes.
He blocked Albert Speer's attempt to move the
economy to a "total war" footing until it was too late.
"Bormann's influence," Speer concluded, "was
a national disaster."
(263)
Kilzer goes into great detail about Bormann's
contacts with the Soviet espionage system, profiling many of his handlers.
Even one of Bormann's mistresses, Marie Rubach Spangenberg, was active in
the German Communist underground.
(264)
Bormann encouraged Hitler to ignore the threat of encirclement at
Stalingrad.
Hitler's decisions,
"ceased to have anything in common with the
principles of strategy and operations," General Halder noted in his
Diary.
(McGovern, 82)
Bormann won Hitler's total allegiance by
pretending to be a ruthless and efficient instrument.
When Bormann was criticized, Hitler
replied,
"Everybody has failed me but Bormann... who
ever is against Bormann is also against the State! I'll shoot the lot of
them..."
(McGovern, 101.)
And, "Bormann's proposals are so exactly
worked out that I need only say yes or no..."
(98)
Bormann subtly influenced Hitler to fire
competent generals and did nothing to interfere with the gradual poisoning
of the Fuhrer by his personal physician, Morrell.
The question remains,
"Was Hitler himself a traitor? Did he also serve the Illuminati?"
Kilzer remarks
that Hitler was surprisingly lenient to dissent within the ranks and
cultivated a "culture of treason." (Kilzer, 6) Was Hitler aware of Bormann's
role and played along?
I am still searching for this answer.
CONCLUSION
William Stevenson provides a suitable conclusion:
"Bormann represented secret power; and in
our disheveled human condition, we suspect that the trappings of
democracy are more of a dangerous camouflage... that real power begins
where secrecy begins. Martin Bormann... possessed that secret power...
to such a degree that he was able to escape the gallows."
(9)
Bormann's example suggests that the Illuminati
modus operandi is to empower someone who is predisposed or even brainwashed
to do what they want, and
then
manipulate him much like a puppet.
The lesson of this story is that the "news" upholds the "camouflage of
democracy." Don't pay too much attention or invest your best energies.
History is a play. The Illuminati control all the politicians who stand a
chance. They
control the mass media.
Louis Kilzer's book was published by a tiny publisher in Navato CA. This
shows that the large banker-controlled New York publishers want to keep
Bormann's secret as much as any Nazi.
We live in a world where the dominant elite has organized into a sinister
secret society to plot against humanity. It is creating a "New World Order"
symbolized by the unfinished capstone on the pyramid on the US Great Seal.
Its symbols are everywhere but we are not allowed to protest them.
Success
depends on our willingness to betray our fellow citizens, nation and
civilization and to allow this malignant power to grow in our midst.
