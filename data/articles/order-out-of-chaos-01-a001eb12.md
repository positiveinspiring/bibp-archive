# Order Out of Chaos - 01

Chapter 1 Introduction
A New World Order is being erected and it is the biggest threat humanity has ever faced. Moreover, it is a menace to each and every one of us individually. It is a danger to our family, our way of life and our childrens future. You will learn what it is, who is behind it, what they are doing to achieve it and why, and finally how we can ensure its destruction.
The bulk of this book consists of names, places and dates. Everything is documented by mainstream media reports. The level of mainstream citation I include was not possible ten years ago but it is today because the agenda is so blatantly in our faces that they have to admit to it. Most of the book concentrates exclusively on new information that has developed since September 11 2001. While I do provide background where it is absolutely necessary, the first chapter for example, many issues are not covered.
Things like the Oklahoma City Bombing or the Kennedy assassination all fit into the same agenda but they have been so exhaustively documented by other researchers that it would be a waste of my time to simply re-hash old material. This book is merely one of many keys that you will need to unlock the truth and so I suggest you read all the information of the subjects not covered in this book if you havent already done so.
The hunger, brutality, suffering, genocide and horror that has plagued the third world is coming to our shores. But it is not set in stone and we can choose to reverse the evil at any point. Everyone is presented with a chance of influencing the world in whatever field they excel at. However, many spurn the opportunity because they are not prepared to risk deviating from the manipulated path that has been set for them.
Most people cant think, most of the remainder wont think, the small fraction who do think mostly cant do it very well. The extremely tiny fraction who think regularly, accurately, creatively, and without self-delusion-in the long run, these are the only people who count.Robert Heinlein
The nature of intelligence as perceived by the conditioned norm is judged by how many numbers you can add together or how many names you can put to dates. This is not intelligence of mind - it is system of mind. Systems of mind are like physical machines; they are limited in potential by the intelligence that built them. Likewise, the systems of mind that masquerade as intelligence only function to the standard of fuel that is fed into them in the first place. Systems of mind can be changed at any time by the controller of the system (the government).
They can say 2 + 2 = 5 and the vast majority of people will not question it. This proves to us that such systems of mind are not intelligence because true intelligence is infinite, whole and unchanging. Remembering all the events I write about in this book and matching them with dates, names and places and then telling someone else is not going to get the job done. You need to couple the hard evidence with your own personal insight and this will reach others on a level of true intelligence.
Who are they and what do they want?
Whats it all about? The New World Order is not a conspiracy in the strictest sense of the term - it is an agenda. The agenda is orchestrated by a power elite that thinks it has the divine right to commandeer total control of your life.
But who are they? Who are the power elite?
the UN the EU the Council on Foreign Relations the Bilderberg Group the Trilateral Commission the Rockefellers the Rothschilds the Royal Institute of International Affairs the Club of Rome
the UN
the EU
the Council on Foreign Relations
the Bilderberg Group
the Trilateral Commission
the Rockefellers
the Rothschilds
the Royal Institute of International Affairs
the Club of Rome
The list goes on and there have been many books written that cover the history of these groups and how they connect to each other.
The intention of this book is to highlight how their unified agenda manifests itself in modern day developments with particular attention paid to the Hegelian Dialectic. To research these groups and their unified agenda is to understand who really controls your destiny and where this planet is heading, unless we speak out against the agenda itself.
The agenda is a worldwide consolidation and centralization of power into the hands of an all-encompassing World Government. This system will evolve from the European Union, (already in place) the American Union, (derived from NAFTA) and the Asian Union. When these three models are in existence, they will be merged together to create the One World Government.
The society and control mechanisms they are manufacturing to compliment this World Government combine the most extreme aspects of communism and fascism, mixed with a nightmare Orwellian technocracy.
Specifically (and in no particular order):
a microchipped population a world army a world centralized banking system the utter destruction of all national identity and pride the destruction of all religion except their own world religion the ability to control each and every person through means of mind control (interlocked with the microchip) to bring an end to all industrialization to seize control of the environmental movement at the top of the power structure and use it for the purposes of continental land-grabs to initiate a program of population control (via warfare, vaccination, starvation and diseases) whereby 80% are terminated to encourage and eventually legalize the use of drugs and to make pornography and other expressions of hedonism an art form to suppress all scientific development except that which aids their agenda (an example being cold fusion and other technologies that would end our dependency on fossil fuels) to demoralize humanity and breed culture to become more and more decadent (meaning when the sick and absurd becomes acceptable) - this is achieved via drugs, pornography, mindless television, degenerate rock, pop, rap, hip-hop music, among a host of others to encourage multiculturalism, immigration, and to brand anyone who opposes these issues as racist to make pedophilia, rape and sexual conquests acceptable and respectable to cause total collapse of the worlds economies and engender political chaos to penetrate and subvert all governments and coerce them into destroying their countrys national sovereignty to take control of education in the developed world with the intention of suppressing non-consensus information and pushing left-wing, liberal, socialistic viewpoints (Socialism masquerades as a movement of the downtrodden masses but is in fact clearly an attempt at consolidating wealth and power by the elite) to use terrorism or scareorrism as a means of gaining the consent of the public, who which actually support this agenda and give up their basic rights if it is presented as the solution to terrorism
a microchipped population
a world army
a world centralized banking system
the utter destruction of all national identity and pride
the destruction of all religion except their own world religion
the ability to control each and every person through means of mind control (interlocked with the microchip)
to bring an end to all industrialization
to seize control of the environmental movement at the top of the power structure and use it for the purposes of continental land-grabs
to initiate a program of population control (via warfare, vaccination, starvation and diseases) whereby 80% are terminated
to encourage and eventually legalize the use of drugs and to make pornography and other expressions of hedonism an art form
to suppress all scientific development except that which aids their agenda (an example being cold fusion and other technologies that would end our dependency on fossil fuels)
to demoralize humanity and breed culture to become more and more decadent (meaning when the sick and absurd becomes acceptable) - this is achieved via drugs, pornography, mindless television, degenerate rock, pop, rap, hip-hop music, among a host of others
to encourage multiculturalism, immigration, and to brand anyone who opposes these issues as racist
to make pedophilia, rape and sexual conquests acceptable and respectable
to cause total collapse of the worlds economies and engender political chaos
to penetrate and subvert all governments and coerce them into destroying their countrys national sovereignty
to take control of education in the developed world with the intention of suppressing non-consensus information and pushing left-wing, liberal, socialistic viewpoints (Socialism masquerades as a movement of the downtrodden masses but is in fact clearly an attempt at consolidating wealth and power by the elite)
to use terrorism or scareorrism as a means of gaining the consent of the public, who which actually support this agenda and give up their basic rights if it is presented as the solution to terrorism
There are many caveat goals within this agenda that fall under the umbrella of those mentioned above. You will notice many of these goals have already been achieved.
Ways in which to defeat the agenda are covered later in this book but the main one is simply to know what the agenda is and tell others how it directly affects them. This will stir people from their apathy and make them realize they are under attack. Their survival mechanism will kick in, they will become educated on the issues and they will wake their fellow human. Remember - those who fought and died for freedom in the American Revolution only had 5% of the population on their side.
To avoid having to die for freedom, we need to win the war of information.
The New World Order Goes Primetime
In the last few years we have seen what some call the externalization of the hierarchy. In other words, the mainstream media has actually reported that there is an agenda to create a global government and it is being implemented by secret societies. One of the most powerful known secret societies is Skull and Bones, which was set up by William H. Russell in the 1830s and is based on an offshoot of the eighteenth-century society, the Illuminati. It is based at Yale University and calls itself The Brotherhood of Death. George W. Bush admits to being a member in his own autobiography.
In April 2001 journalists for ABC News and the New York Observer were able to film members enacting mock throat-cutting rituals. Most of the speculative lore about the Skull and Bones ritual has centered on its death fixation. Beyond the obvious skull-and-crossbones insignia, of course, the most persistent story is that initiates spend their senior year in the basement crypt of the Bones Tomb taking turns lying in a coffin and, in two long, intense, psycho-drama autobiographical sessions in said coffins, recount their personal and sexual history to the other 14 chosen ones.
The better to bond for life with those they know best and prepare for their destiny as stewards of the ruling class.1
1 At Skull and Bones, Bushs Secret Club Initiates Ream Gore - Ron Rosenbaum The New York Observer April 23 2001 - http://www.nyobserver.com/pages/story.asp?ID=4136 [INSERT FIG 1.1] [CAPTION: The Tomb, the home of the Skull and Bones Society at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut.]
The 2004 election will likely see George W. Bush run against another Skull and Bones member, John Kerry. A few years ago, anyone who talked about Skull and Bones was a conspiracy theorist nowadays its calmly reported on by USA Today, Bonesmen have long helped Bush; he received a fair chunk of his early business financing from them and turned to them for help when he needed a job, investors and campaign assistance. Even his baseball-team purchase involved at least one Bonesman.
As president, Bush has appointed fellow Bonesmen to high-level positions, such as Edward McNally, the general counsel of the Office on Homeland Security and senior associate counsel on national security. Yet, although one of his first social gatherings at the White House was a Skull and Bones reunion, Bush feigned ignorance when asked recently about Bones: The thing is so secret that Im not even sure it still exists, he replied.2 The Bilderberg Group is one of the premier organizations in the manipulation of global developments. There are doubtless many higher-level groups that we are not aware of.
Every year since 1954, the secretive Bilderberg Group (named after the hotel they first met in the Netherlands), comprising elite powerbrokers from Europe and North America, has met to discuss, and influence, the changing global, political, economic and social landscape.
In the early 1990s, a relatively unknown Home Affairs spokesman for the Labour Party, Tony Blair, was invited to a Bilderberg confab. By 1997, he was Prime Minister of Great Britain. Similarly, in the late 80s, a little known Governor of Arkansas by the name of William Clinton gladly accepted an invitation to a Bilderberg. A few years later he was leader of the so-called free world.
William Hague was the Bilderberg member who provided the shill, phony opposition to Tony Blair at the last general election. He forwarded a weak anti-European posture that failed dismally. This equated any anti-European (anti-Orwellian power block) mindset as being outdated and smeared with preconceptions of association with the laughable Tory election campaign. Europe is good and loving, sovereignty is evil, right wing, racist and outdated. Its true; I read it in the newspaper. And who owns the newspapers? The Bilderberg Group.
Surely senior officials of the World Trade Organization, Federal Reserve, Financial Institutions like Rockefeller (the man himself), the EU and UN World Government models, and corporate oil conglomerates couldnt belong to the same group as the leading politicians and the media? Well, they do. They all belong to the Bilderberg Group.

So, who belongs to the other quasi-secret steering organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission? The same people. I list below a summary of Bilderberg members. This is by no means an exhaustive list. There are over 50 members who refuse to be named. These representatives attended the June 2000 meeting in Belgium at the Chateau du Lac Hotel in Genvel, near Brussels.
The group releases a short press statement, outlining their operation to have a good old think about things but not implement any policy. So when the show is over these elite powerbroker mainstream policy makers just go home and have a cup of tea. Im being sarcastic, by the way.

Understanding the Hegelian Dialectic
George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was born in 1770 in Germany and became a successful philosopher of the mind, history and religion during the 1820s. Although the Hegelian Dialectic today manifests itself differently to how it originated under Hegel, the founding principles remain.
Hegel proposed that all spiritual, intellectual and historical development (whether negative or positive) progressed from the outcome of two opposing ideals.
Thesis clashed with antithesis and this produced synthesis.
The modern day application of the dialectic is used by the ruling elite to create mass groupthink that enables them to further their agenda without opposition. In its simplest form, it is brainwashing. In the past, the dialectic has been used to manufacture war. Both the Bolsheviks and the Nazis were funded and supported by the global elite. These two forces were then made to clash in order to foment the chaos of world war two.
The widely used term amongst researchers today is Problem-Reaction-Solution and the tactic is mainly used to oppress populations, advance the police state and further the geopolitical aims of the New World Order. It works like this the manipulating body covertly creates a problem and then directs the media to incessantly focus on it without recourse. Remember, you only need to control the top of the pyramid most media coverage is an exercise in regurgitating what the big newspapers and T.V. stations are reporting.
The problem could be anything a war, a financial collapse, a rash of child abductions, or a terrorist attack. The power of the media can create the false perception that a big problem exists, even if it doesnt. An example would be the child abduction epidemic during 2002, which was dramatized by the media even though official figures confirmed that child abductions have been decreasing yearly since the 70s. Another example is the SARS epidemic of 2003 which was a story created solely out of media hype. SARS killed a few hundred in a few months (at time of press) while the common flu kills 250,000 a year.
Once you have created this problem you make sure that an individual, a group or an aspect of society is blamed. This then rallies the population behind the desperate lunge for a solution to the problem. Something must be done! they cry in unison. The people that created the problem in the first place then come back in and offer the solution that the people demand. Remember the people screaming for a solution do not know that the problem was artificially created in the first place.
The solution to the problem is always a further curtailment of freedom and an advancement of one or more aspects of the New World Order agenda whether that is geopolitical expansion, new laws or the implantation of new societal worldviews. Lets look at a few examples.
A terrorist attack hits America. Even though authorities claim they had no possible inclination that such an attack would happen, the culprits for the attack are named within hours of the event before any type of investigation has been concluded. The pictures of these culprits and their leader are flashed ad infinitum on worldwide television therefore immediately providing the official version of events. The horror of the attack is so substantial that people immediately call for a restriction of personal freedoms and a foreign war to stop it from happening again. In the weeks and months that follow, the government of America restricts personal freedoms through legislation and launches a foreign war.
I just described September 11.
A government arms a small country with chemical and biological weapons which it then uses against another country. A few years later, the government that armed the country with chemical and biological weapons tells its people that there is a problem because a small country has chemical and biological weapons which it might use against another country. Despite some opposition, many people agree that the small country should be bombed and invaded. The government tells its army to bomb and invade the small country.
I just described the first Gulf War and the 2003 war on Iraq.
The media tell the people that child abduction is on the increase and is becoming a big problem. Pictures of young innocent children and footage of their crying parents are flashed on television nationwide. The tragedy of these events is so heart-wrenching that people immediately call for parents to be licensed, stronger power for the emergency takeover of communications to alert people when a child is abducted, and implantable microchips that can track children for their safety. The government introduces emergency legislation and a government affiliated company announces that they have developed an implantable tracking chip.
I just described the child abduction flap of 2002.
Understanding the Problem-Reaction-Solution paradigm and how it is being used to steer the world towards a prison planet is the basis of this book. The name of the game is order out of chaos. Keep this system in mind as you digest each piece of information and the reality of modern day developments will be revealed before your eyes.
