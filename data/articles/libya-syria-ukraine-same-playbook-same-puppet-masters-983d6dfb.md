Geopolitics becomes a lot easier if we can discern repeating patterns.
For example, the common thread through the crises in Ukraine, Libya and Syria is a clever but ruthless playbook of regime-change. This stratagem of toppling governments while appearing noble should perhaps be called the "geopolitics of crocodile tears." There were times in history when a powerful country would simply invade the weaker ones. Now the elites resort to elaborate Hollywood-style scripts brimming with inspiring heroes, sob stories and altruistic efforts. Here are the simple facts:
Libya and Syria were a tad bit too independent and successful, and thus have been targeted by globalists for a long time. Ukraine, which borders Russia, is a treasured piece on the geopolitical chessboard - get Ukraine and Crimea, you weaken Russia immensely.

Ukraine, which borders Russia, is a treasured piece on the geopolitical chessboard - get Ukraine and Crimea, you weaken Russia immensely.
The fundamental ploy in Libya, Syria and Ukraine was the same:
rile up the population and then stage a coup in the midst of chaos, while claiming to liberate the people.
The coup is carried out in many stages:
Stage 1: Planned Protests Stage 2: Protesters killed, leading to outrage and UN resolutions/sanctions Stage 3: Armed mutiny and attempts to force the government out Stage 4: If Stage 3 fails, sponsor a full-fledged civil war to overthrow the government

Stage 2: Protesters killed, leading to outrage and UN resolutions/sanctions
Stage 3: Armed mutiny and attempts to force the government out
Stage 4: If Stage 3 fails, sponsor a full-fledged civil war to overthrow the government
Simple enough...?
Let's hop on the time machine back to 2011.
Act 1 - "Peaceful" protests While all three cases were portrayed as "peaceful protests," the facts on the ground couldn't be more antithetical.
The beginning is always peaceful and this sets the tone of the narrative. But truly peaceful protests always fizzle out when there is no major crisis in a nation. The art of protests and violence are not well understood by the public. There are many elites and groups who are experts in mass psychology. Just like a clever marketing person creating a viral ad, there are social engineering gurus who know how to create protests and riots.
For example, with 10 provocateurs and 100 well-paid community leaders, one can easily create a protest of few thousand people and then turn it into a riot.
Once chaos begins, mob mentality sets in, and then innocent protesters morph into dangerous elements. With enough money and weapons, you can overthrow any government.
Libya was a stable and wealthy country under Gaddafi:
everyone had access to free school free college and free healthcare young married couples got a free apartment Libya had the highest HDI (Human Development Index) in Africa
everyone had access to free school
free college and free healthcare
young married couples got a free apartment
Libya had the highest HDI (Human Development Index) in Africa
Similarly, Syria was prosperous and safe.
Under Assad,
the GDP had tripled (in US dollars) inflation was low debt was cut in half
the GDP had tripled (in US dollars)
inflation was low
debt was cut in half
Millions of tourists visited Syria every year because it was beautiful, free and safe.
In Ukraine, the economy wasn't so great and people weren't too happy with the politicians, but that's normal for Ukraine.
So how do you organize protests in such situations?
In Libya, the excuse was "Day of Rage," which was the anniversary of clashes in 2006 when police killed a few protesters. For the first few days in 2011, the protests and the riots were limited to small, remote towns. Large cities such as Tripoli, the capital, were calm and seemed unaware of the protests. In Syria, the first few attempts to organize protests in February failed miserably. Then with more money and propaganda through Saudi-funded mosques, the protests began in March in Daraa, a small border town (which is close to ahem the U.S. military base in Jordan). The famous Omari mosque in Daraa turned into a warehouse for weapons, ammunition and cash. Just like in Libya, large cities such as Damascus and Aleppo were quiet and normal. In Ukraine, thanks to George Soros, USAID and NED, there was a well-established system of grassroots movement that could spring into action at a moment's notice. Outside of Kiev, there were no protests, but the media made it seem like the whole country was behind the Euromaidan faux revolution. At this point, the corporate media all over the world would show wonderful pictures and videos of peaceful protesters demanding freedom and justice.

Who can be against that? The media always makes sure that these protests are labeled "spontaneous."
Of course, most people outside these countries believe the narrative.
Act 2 - Scene 1: Provocateurs and Snipers
This is where peaceful protests turn violent and bloody.
However, there is a twist in the plot that is hidden from the public:
the use of provocateurs and snipers by the same people who organized the protests.
These trained provocateurs would attack the police/military and burn down government buildings. Some of them are like Antifa, but others are professional militants armed with lethal weapons and trained to kill.
In Libya, on the third day of the protests, police stations and security headquarters were burned down.
In Syria, even before the protests spread to other places, dozens of Syrian military soldiers were ambushed and shot to death. (I describe the events in Syria in details in my book, Syria - War of Deception).
In Kiev, masked thugs threw Molotov cocktails and beat up the police with chains and iron rods.
Then, at the end of Act 2 Scene 1, snipers come in to radically alter the story. Carefully placed on rooftops and tall buildings, the snipers target the police and the protesters. When the police are shot at, they naturally assume that the bullets came from the protesters, and so the police fire back.
Sometimes there are also provocateurs with guns on the ground among the protesters, and they shoot at the police as well.
In Libya, to add fuel to the fire, the snipers cruelly shot and killed 15 people in a funeral. In Ukraine, analysis of bullets and shells proved that the same snipers killed both the protesters and the police.

Ignoring all these, the global media and the politicians have only one narrative regarding all three countries:
the government brutally attacked/murdered peaceful protesters.
(Example: NPR's article discussing in June 2011 an incident where 120 Syrian soldiers were massacred and mutilated by the "peaceful protesters.")
Act 2 - Scene 2: Political/Economic Attack
Regarding Libya, Merkel said right away that Gaddafi was waging war on his own people.
Western media screamed that Gaddafi was firing on his own people. The White House condemned Gaddafi for using mass violence against his own people. A month later, the exact phrase was used against Assad.
In Assad's case, this propaganda would last for the next six years, and later expanded to,
"Assad kills and gases his own people."
In Ukraine, after the president was ousted, he was charged with,
"mass killing of civilians."
This technique is a well-known form of psychological warfare and is called atrocity propaganda.
With crocodile tears and faux outrage, the West came up with UN resolutions against Syria and Libya, which were probably written months before.
Act 3 - Bloodless Coup
In Ukraine, the West used neo-Nazis rather than jihadists as the provocateurs.
The CIA befriended pro-Nazi Ukrainians (who were thus anti-Russian) right after WW II and the relationship never went away.
Yanukovych was a democratically elected President of Ukraine who had also twice been the Prime Minister. In 2004, he won the Presidency, but George Soros organized a "color revolution" and clamored for a new election.
Lo and behold, the pro-US candidate won with 51% of the vote in the new election.
Then six years later, Yanukovych ran again and won the presidency fair and square. Four years into his presidency, he was simply driven out of the country by the US/EU coalition.
This is the reality of U.S. spreading "democracy." You are free to choose whoever you want, as long as it's the right candidate.
In Libya and Syria, Gaddafi and Assad were tough and not so willing to give up easily.
Within a month after the first protest in Libya and Syria, the UN had passed resolutions that authorized arming "civilians" (aka jihadists), and also gave NATO the right to shoot down Libyan planes.
The Orwellian term "No Fly Zones" meant that only Gaddafi couldn't fly his planes, but NATO/US planes could. On March 19, one month after the protests started, the US started bombing Libya with Tomahawk missiles.
Syria was saved from NATO attacks, thanks to Russia and China.
Act 4 - Civil War
In Libya and Syria, weapons and money poured from the outside to fuel the civil war.
Libya fell within a year, since NATO acted as the air force for the terrorists and destroyed Gaddafi's planes, tanks and arsenals.
In Syria, less than half of 1% of the population joined the armed militia. This is why the "revolution" faltered after a few months, and tens of thousands of foreign jihadists had to fly into Syria.
Thanks to the billions of dollars of cash and weapons from benevolent Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others, the war went on for six years, destroying a prosperous country and ruining the lives of 20 million people.
Trail of Chaos
Six years later,
Libya still doesn't have a unified government; Al Qaeda and militias rule half the country; and there is even slavery now. More than a million Libyans have fled to Europe, creating new problems. Syria's GDP has fallen 65% since 2011, its debt has doubled, Al Qaeda holds a large province, and it may take twenty years to rebuild the country. Ukraine is split in half, and people who have lived together for 1000 years are now at war with each other. Using Ukraine as an excuse, the US and NATO are now spending billions to counter "Russia's threat."

So this is the geopolitical strategy of protests, proxy wars, and propaganda.
Americans need to wake up, understand geopolitics, and demand an end to these expensive and immoral wars of chaos, misery and destruction...
