BRIEF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
1908-1910 - THE JEKYLL ISLAND PLAN OF THE EXPERTS
Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA - Later to
become The Aldrich Act
President Theodore Roosevelt had signed into law the bill creating the
National Monetary Commission in 1908, after the tragic Panic of 1907 had
resulted in a public outcry that the nations monetary system be stabilized.
Senator Nelson Aldrich had led the members of
the Commission on a two-year tour of Europe, reviewing and discussing
monetary systems, their problems and advantages.
He did not immediately make a report on the
results of this trip, nor had he offered any plan for banking reform.
Aldrich had compiled a number of questions and problems, together with one
possible solution. In order to make a comprehensive and viable plan, he
brought together the best financial minds he knew of in the United States at
Jekyll Island to go through what he had learned, and there to devise a
complete and workable financial system.
Accompanying Senator Aldrich were,
-
his private secretary, Shelton
-
A. Piatt Andrew, Assistant Secretary of
the Treasury, and Special Assistant of the National Monetary
Commission
-
Frank Vanderlip, president of the
National City Bank of New York
-
Henry P. Davison, senior partner of J.P.
Morgan Company, and generally regarded as Morgans personal emissary
-
Charles D. Norton, president of the
Morgan-dominated First National Bank of New York
Joining the group just before the train left the
station were,
-
Benjamin Strong, also known as a
lieutenant of J.P. Morgan
-
Paul Warburg, a recent immigrant from
Germany who had joined the banking house of Kuhn, Loeb Company, a
master of deception and planning, who was to prove the real
architect of the modern financial system
Their objective was the devising of a plan to
create fiat currencies to replace the Gold Standard as the support structure
for currency issue throughout the world.
The understanding of the need for this plan came
from the precepts of international finance espoused by Cecil Rhodes in his
treatise of 1872.
The Jekyll Island Plan was designed as a device to manage
economies so as to facilitate trade and growth through necessary money
supply expansion and contraction based on trade and the good faith and
credit of each nation.
Kings and Emperors of the world would later see
this as the only option to save the world from its own self destruction. The
Gold Standard had to go if the world would be safe.
This meeting planned the creation of the Aldrich Act, which in turn led to
the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913, and eventually to the
creation of a world wide system as would be agreed in London in 1921 by the
Leaders and Kings and Emperors of the World.
TRILATERAL TRIPARTITE TRILENNIUM PACT BETWEEN
NATIONS
1921 LONDON - TTT Pact and Revisions
192129
This secret agreement lead to the Nations of the World centralizing assets
into a common and secret system in order to compel all nations to abide by
the rule for fiat currencies as per the Plan of the Experts of 1910 (Jekyll
Island Plan).
Under terms of this agreement, all gold and
other wealth that was being used for backing currencies may not be
personally owned and would become the property of a centralized system and
be secreted, thus an even opportunity would exist between nations to
establish fiat currencies. This was anticipated as one of the best means of
reducing the risk of wars between nations through the creation of economic
stability.
Though never taught in economic schools of today,
the TTT Pact had
the most
profound effects in creating international financial and political
stability.
It was not fully implemented until after World War II, and then
would have revisions to cope with unforeseen international trade
repercussions that would occur forty years later. In the creation of the
establishment of vision and understanding of the Kings and Emperors and
other leaders who attended, the decisions that had to be made were forever
sealed, secrecy being essential to the parliamentary code and context of no
personal sovereign responsibility.
The decisions were made from pragmatic necessity, based on the growing
technological capacity of human kind for self destruction, and an
understanding of the changing nature of war.
The economic issues that were the primary
precursor of war had to be eliminated as a pretext of destruction, and the
right of equality among the nations had to exist if nations were to live in
peace. The TTT Pact was a political solution in nature, but it led to the
greatest impact on the Worlds financial systems of any Pact or Agreement in
the history of human kind.
This Pact led to the creation of the
Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) on January 30, 1930.
1929 - THE SECOND PLAN OF THE EXPERTS
Finalized, June 7, 1929, the Plan of the Experts
became the key as to how the terms of the Tripartite Trilateral Trillenium
Pact between nations could function under an international arrangement,
setting into place the plan for a Central Bank to the Worlds Central Banks.
Based upon Article X, paragraph 2 of The Hague
Agreement with Germany, this plan provided the base for the granting of
operational immunities for the BIS and its assets.
All signatories to the BIS convention are automatically bound by its provisions.
All assets of the International Collateral
Combined Accounts, today deemed under depository control of the Fed system/BIS,
but placed, under the sole jurisdiction and dispositional control of the
Sole Arbiter, Owner and Controller (today, His Excellency Dr. Ray C. Dam).
Article X, paragraph 2 states,
The Bank, its property and assets, and also
the deposits of other funds entrusted to it, on the territory of, or
dependent on the administration of. The Parties shall be immune from any
disabilities and from any restrictive measures such as censorship,
requisition, seizure or confiscation, in time of peace or war,
reprisals, prohibition or restriction of export of gold or currency and
other similar interferences, restrictions or prohibitions.
BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS [BIS]
INSTITUTED
1930 THE HAGUE
On January 20, 1930 the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) was instituted by
the Central Banks of,
These on the one part then forming the
Convention Respecting the Bank for International Settlements with the Swiss
Confederation on the other part, essentially making Switzerland the central
depository country for the member governments of the BIS. United States
Government and or the Federal Reserve did not participate, but an
organization made up of the Banks and Institutions that owned the Federal
Reserve System were involved as a part of the BIS formation.
This is of particular interest, because the
stated and claimed purpose for the establishment of the BIS was to manage
war reparations payable by Germany. One might wonder why the United States
Government did not participate and why Japan did.
The answer lies in later
actions and conventions.
Following Germany's defeat in World War I, the Allies and the US (which
regarded itself as separate from the Allies) said that Germany had to pay
for the war under a system of "reparations". The repayment system never
functioned fully. In 1930, with yet another attempt to get the reparations
system working, the BIS was created to handle what were supposed to be flows
of money from Germany into the Allies and the US. When Hitler came to power
in 1933 he stopped the system entirely.
However, the central bankers liked the BIS idea
and kept it going.
The need for such banker's for banker's bank had
become clear a century prior, with the increased expansion of national
economies and the important role of stable banking for those economies. With
the similar increase in international trading, there had to be a system for
coordinating the role of banks across borders.
The BIS primary purpose soon became and still is, to promote cooperation
among central banks and provide additional facilities for international
financial operations.
The BISs statutes provided for U.S.
representation on the Board of Governors, but the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
did not choose to do that until 1994. The United States was not a member of
the BIS Board of Governors during World War II, Thomas McKittrick the
Managing Director of the BIS through the war years was American,
representing American interests.
The United States gave some support to the
liquidations of the BIS, partly because the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944
provided for new restitutions to deal with postwar monetary issues.
ESTABLISHMENT OF FAR EAST COMBINED DEPOSITORIES FOR
HARD ASSETS
South East Asia 1932-1945
Contrary to folklore, most assets now known to be deposited in Indonesia and
Philippine Islands, Thailand, Cambodia etc., (so called Soekarno Gold,
Yamashita Treasure and or
Marcos Gold) were deposited in those countries
through the period of 1932-45.
At this time the work was carried out by
Japanese laborers, later by Japanese troops under agreements forged at the TTT Pact, 1921.
The secreting of these assets was for the
benefit of the International Community as per those agreements and was
largely executed through Japans interest in the BIS through the war years,
an institution primarily made up of Axis Power countries, Great Britain and
a group of American Banks.
THE BRETTON WOODS AGREEMENT
New Hampshire, USA, 1944
A plan devised primarily by John Maynard Keynes with considerable input of
Harry Dexter White to resolve the issue of financing the reconstruction of
the world from the ashes of World War II.
This plan required a deviation from the TTT Pact
in order to expand the democratization of trade and wealth and to
redistribute or recycle currency from strong trade surplus countries back
into countries with weak or negative trade surpluses. Part of the plan was
to have the US Dollar replace the Pound Sterling as the medium of
International trade, with the US Dollar tied to the good faith and credit of
the Government of the United States.
This Convention produced,
-
the Tripartite Gold Commission
-
the Marshall Plan
-
the Bank for Reconstruction and Development (now known as the World Bank)
-
the reinvention of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) with the theories of Keynes today known as
the Keynesian Theory
What needs to be noted is that this agreement
made by Allied powers in 1944 required assets held under the control of Axis
powers to make it work. This was only possible due to the collusion between
Axis and Allied powers through the intermediary role of the BIS.
This is essentially a good thing as it is a
mechanism by which the world can financially function, regardless of war or
other undesirable human behavior.
THE BIS AGREEMENT WITH THE ALLIES
Bern 1948
This agreement allowed for the continuation of the activities of the BIS and
the continued secreting of the wealth reserves of the world, this to be held
in a common system to the better benefit of the world.
Not critical for what
it did, but critical for what it sanctioned and did not do.
THE GREEN HILTON AGREEMENT
Geneva 1963
By 1961, Keynes predictions of a world monetary crisis began to become a
reality.
This problem was brought about by the lack of
sufficient currency (especially US Dollars) in world-circulation to support
the rapidly expanding international commerce. The World needed US Dollars
beyond the capacity of the good faith and credit of the United States
Taxpayer in order to facilitate trade. It was not possible to break the
Bretton Woods treaty due to the possible damage of the stable core of
the worlds economy as this had the potential of leading to another major
war.
To compound the problem, the majority of dollars
in circulation were in private banks, multinational corporations, private
businesses and individual bank accounts.
In 1963 the gold that had been entrusted to the
care of President Soekarno was recalled by the Nations to underpin
the issuance of further US Dollars in order to further facilitate
international trade. Under this Agreement, Soekarno (as the International
Trustee Holder of the Gold) began the process of repositioning the gold that
had earlier been entrusted to the care of the Indonesian People, back into
the banking system to create a fractional backing for the US Dollar.
Initially this was managed under the arbitration
of the
Tripartite Gold Commission in The Hague as per the decisions of the
International Community through their Government representatives at the
Innsbruck/Schweitzer Conference and its later revisions.
Under the agreement signed between President Soekarno and President John
Kennedy, was that control of these assets would cede automatically to US
upon the fall from power of President Soekarno. This occurred in 1967. The
potential of this agreement led to
Executive Order 11110 issued July 1963,
which would have provided the Department of the Treasury the power to issue
United States Dollars.
Within two weeks after signing the
Green Hilton
Agreement which would have then enabled consolidation of EO 11110.
Kennedy
was assassinated a few days after his signing of the Green Hilton Agreement.
With the death of Kennedy, the authority granted to the Treasury was never
taken up. Soekarno was awarded a 2.5% interest in the assets by the
International Community in return for his services.
He willed all the documents of guarantee and
obligation to his Teacher Kiyai Hadji Djawahir and his heir son, Dr.
Seno Edy Soekanto.
To this day, these agreements stand to be honored
by
the OITC. The assets however, were placed
into the International Collateral Combined Accounts that form the Global
Debt Facility.
While an apparently innocuous document to read, in its proper and full
interpretation,
The Green Hilton Agreement is one of the most profound
agreements made between Presidents of any two countries within the twentieth
century, and most probably, in the history of the world, particularly so as
this agreement was made between a President of the United States and the
Trustee of the hidden, but combined wealth of the world.

These assets are not the property of the United
States, but centralized assets under the authority of a centralized system,
to be used as independently deemed to be for the better benefit of the
World.
THE SCHWEITZER CONVENTION
Innsbruck, Austria, 1968 and
Revisions
Under this convention, the system for utilization of combined and secreted
assets was determined by the Nations of the World.
This allowed for the US Dollar to be backed
fractionally by the assets of the world. It also rationalized the rights of
call on previous issued bonds by various Governments in order to maintain
the financial system of the
Bretton Woods Convention.
ELECTION AND APPOINTMENT THE SOLE ARBITER OF
THE ASSETS
The Hague/Washington, 1995
On January 20, 1995 the Governments of the World elected and appointed His
Excellency, Dr. Ray C. Dam to act as Sole Arbiter, Controller and Owner in
law, recording this authority granted under International Control Number
1060847 and the his ownership of the International Collateral Combined
Accounts of the Global Debt Facility under Legal Decadency to Heir number
RCD1088.
The purpose of this appointment was to provide an independent arbiter with
the powers and authority of an owner in order that he may arbitrate between
the nations as to how this wealth under his control may be utilized, when it
may be utilized and by whom. It is illegal for any Government or Banking
Institution to appropriate, sequester or otherwise take or use these assets
unless such action is initiated by the International Treasury Controller.
This ban includes the Banks holding the assets,
...or any other institution,
none of whom may access or use these assets without the consent of, and
initiation of such action, by the International Treasury Controller,
Dr. Ray C. Dam.
THE WASHINGTON PANEL
Washington 1998
Established under orders of the Federal Reserve System, the nations and
institutional members of the Schweitzer Conference met for some 10 months in
Washington to review the powers and authorities of His Excellency, Dr. Ray
C. Dam, as well as the history and current status of the assets under his
control and the possible political implications of that control and the use
of the assets.
It was initiated by a request to consider the
advantages of a plan put forward by Dr.
K.F. Scott that His
Excellency be allowed to privately invest part of this wealth into Third
World countries by placing the money for projects in those countries with
reputable International Consulting companies who would be selected to
undertake the chosen projects.
The reasoning behind this, was that many Third
World Governments are run by corrupt people who steal the wealth that is
loaned to a country for projects, the projects do not get completed and the
funds invested cannot be audited or anyone held accountable as International
Institutions have no power or authority to audit the books of account of a
Sovereign Government.
By placing funds through Consulting Companies who can be audited and held
accountable, it would be possible to arrest the loss of money through
corruption, and therefore, unfair debts would not be further imposed on the
taxpayers of Third World countries.
On December 12, 1998 the Washington
Panel unanimously concluded that Dr. Dam had that right as he was the Sole
Owner and Arbiter for the use of that wealth.
This decision fully-ratified and further
acknowledged the Institutional Power and Authority granted to His Excellency
Dr. Ray C. Dam by the Governments of the World.
THE TREATY FOR RESPECTING THE RIGHTS
Bangkok 2003
On October 26, 2003 at
Bangkok, Thailand, a Treaty was signed between Dr.
Seno EdySoekanto, the Sole Heir of the Rights accorded to the late
President Soekarno, and the
Office
of International Treasury Control and by His Excellency Dr.
Ray C. Dam.
Under this Treaty the Guarantees
given to the late President Soekarno of Indonesia are further guaranteed to
his heir and the promises and hopes of the late President Soekarno for the
better future of his people will be remembered and honored, as indeed they
should be.
Through the term of his authority, His Excellency Dr. Ray C. Dam has
instituted Consolidated Credit Bank Limited as the certifying
institution sanctioned by the Governments that have entrusted this wealth to
him.
All assets of the International Collateral
Combined Accounts of the Global Debt Facility and those assets held under
The Institutional Parent Registration Accounts that are active parts
thereof, shall be deemed as assets deposited into Consolidated Credit Bank
Limited.
In order to better manage the assets under his control and authority, and to
further his capacity to undertake development projects of world significance
and meaning, His Excellency has instituted the
Office of International Treasury Control.
The purpose behind this is to provide proper and
adequate management of the assets and resources under his control and the
developing and institutionalizing the responsibilities of dealing with these
investments and the proper use of these assets to the general betterment of
the world.
It provides His Excellency with a Cabinet of
Advisors who provide management and entrepreneurial expertise, these able to
provide sound practical advise and assistance to the objectives of the
Office.
It is clear and apparent that the International Community required a
governing mechanism to manage and control the use of these international
combined assets in order that the economic needs of the World be managed
with proper thought to the rights of all Nations.
The Appointment of His Excellency, Dr. Ray C.
Dam has been an effort to bring the use of these assets under proper
guidance and control, therefore in accordance with the forgoing;
-
The accounts of His Excellency Dr. Ray
C. Dam may be held under names of various companies, trusts,
foundations, persons and other entities, but in all cases, they are
under the dispositional authority and control of His Excellency Dr.
Ray C. Dam.
-
As the holder, sole arbiter and owner of
the accounts of the International Collateral Combined Global Debt
Facility, Dr. Ray C. Dam (the man) is also His Excellency Dr. Ray C.
Dam (the institution) and holder of the special international
protective rights assigned to him. This term (His Excellency) when
used, invokes his special protected and indemnified international
status that must be respected by all nations.
-
The totality of these International
Agreements and Conventions and their relationship to His Excellency,
Dr. Ray C. Dam are held under a FULL JACKET security which requires
a clearance of 3rd to the 5th level to have
released.
No asset under his control may be used in any manner
whatsoever without his explicit approval and authorization.
Furthermore, no asset under his control may be used or utilized by
any person, government, bank or other entity without such use being
initiated by His Excellency, Dr. Ray C. Dam.
This rule has been
abused by both Switzerland and United States for the past Sixty
years. What allowed this was the internal inability of the
Tripartite Gold Commission to get past the interests of their
respective Governments.
This explains why the Federal Reserve never
took up their seat on the Board within the Bank for International
Settlements till the closure of the Tripartite Gold Commission at
the end of 1994, though they did maintain their position through the
membership of private banking institutions that owned the Federal
Reserve.
On completion of it's established life of 50 years, the
Tripartite Gold Commission was terminated and His Excellency, Dr.
Ray C. Dam, then Gold Signatory for the G7 Governments, was elected
as the Sole Arbiter, Owner and Holder of all rights of control.
-
Any instruction issued by His Excellency
Dr. Ray C. Dam is the same as any lawful instruction given by any
depositor in any bank in the world and compliance with that
instruction is mandatory. Any inference, direction, agreement, or
instruction by any other authority and or institution, no matter
where situate or how empowered, that is intended to subvert, or does
in any way usurp, undermine, remove, restrict, limit or in any way
damage that right to control is unlawful.
-
Any instruction given by His Excellency
Dr. Ray C. Dam must be fully complied with, for to do otherwise is
illegal, as it is the unlawful denial of his natural legal rights
and may be considered as theft, fraudulent conversion, fraud or
other form of an illegal alienation of rights.
-
The Global Debt Facility Agreements not
endorsed by H.E. Dr. Ray C. Dam that subvert the rights of ownership
are essentially illegal, as these are agreed between Parties with no
lawful claim to the assets, this particularly so when the assets
have been subverted to such use without the knowledge and expressed
consent of the owner, then placed under the control of another
entity to act as the owner.
Nowhere in law (with the exception of
certain cases of incapacitation, madness or death) is anyone allowed
the right to subvert the lawful rights of another, or to sequester
or convert the lawful property of another.
-
An instruction issued by His Excellency,
Dr. Ray C. Dam that is relative to his assets that is given to any
bank holding or otherwise attached to his assets, is a lawful
instruction to be obeyed without question.
Where two officers of a
responsible institution fail in this obligation, the only reason
that can be determined and considered is a conspiracy to subvert and
or to defraud.
Where a holding institution subverts this authority,
the only reasonable causes that need to be considered are fraud,
conversion or theft, as the natural legal rights of the actual and
lawful owner, whose rights in common law, cannot be removed,
mitigated or overridden by such an arrangement between parties who
do not have any actual ownership interest in the asset.

Collateral Accounts
The Trillenium Trilateral Tripartite Commission

In 1875 the wealth and assets of the royal families and nations held under
colonial rule were centralized into one combined account to be used to the
benefit of all nations of the world.
This is known as the Combined
International Collateral Accounts of the Global Debt Facility. Within its
ledger is Saint Germain's Foundation Divine and World Trust which is now
worth $1 quatrodecillion dollars. This money will be used to bankroll
NESARA
and the prosperity funds.
Extensions of this agreement were expanded through international treaties,
some of which are still classified as top secret, including:
-
Jekyll Island Treaty (1910)
-
The London Treaty (1920)
-
The Second Plan of the Experts (1929)
-
The Hague Agreement (1930)
-
The Far East Combined Depositories
Agreement (1932 1945)
-
The Bretton Woods Agreement (1944)
-
The B.I.S. / Allies Agreement (1948)
-
The Green Hilton Agreement (1963)
-
The Schweitzer Conventions (1968)
-
The Election / Appointment of Sole
Arbiter Agreements (1995)
-
The Washington Panel (1998)
-
The Treaty for Respecting the Rights
(2003)
These treaties were ratified by the sovereign
nations of the world and not their fake corporate government counterparts.
Proof of such is recorded in every nations
charter of the U.N. The USA charter is based on the constitution and thus
subject to constitutional law. Only Kings or Queens,
Presidents, Prime Ministers, and in some cases Ministers of
Finance or Foreign Affairs are granted access to these accounts.
Verification is undertaken through a specific
office under specific protocols dictated by the Head Office of
the
United Nations.
After World War II, from 1945 to 1995 the assets in the Collateral Accounts
were managed by The Trillenium Trilateral Tripartite Commission
representing,
-
America
-
the United Kingdom
-
France
The commission
selected the dollar an international reserve currency and they gave the CIA
legal responsibility to protect the collateral assets.
Countries which did not want a permanent CIA
presence on their soil would be allowed to subcontract the protection under
the same terms and conditions of the treaties. Soon after, the CIA began to
steal assets from the collateral accounts and use them for every
New World
Order pet project imaginable.
To curtail these illegal activities in 1995, the Trillenium Trilateral
Tripartite Commission was stripped of its power and placed under the control
of the International Treasury Controller and the
Office of International
Treasury Control at the United Nations.
Additionally, they now have
jurisdiction over,
...which are all part of the Collateral Accounts.
Despite this, the IMF, World Bank, and BIS
continue to use the assets illegally for their own financing without giving
any thought to the needs of the people of the world.
This video was originally made for Prime Ministers, Presidents, Kings,
Queens, and the heads of national banks, but now you can see it too.
