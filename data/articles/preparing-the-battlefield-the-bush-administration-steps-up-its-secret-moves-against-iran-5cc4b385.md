Late last year, Congress agreed to a request
from President Bush to fund a major escalation of covert operations
against Iran, according to current and former military, intelligence, and
congressional sources.
These operations, for which the President sought up
to four hundred million dollars, were described in a Presidential Finding
signed by Bush, and are designed to destabilize the countrys religious
leadership.
The covert activities involve support of the
minority Ahwazi Arab and Baluchi groups and other dissident
organizations. They also include gathering intelligence about Irans
suspected nuclear-weapons program.
Clandestine operations against Iran are not new.
United States Special Operations Forces
have been conducting cross-border operations from southern Iraq, with
Presidential authorization, since last year. These have included seizing
members of Al Quds, the commando arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and
taking them to Iraq for interrogation, and the pursuit of high-value
targets in the Presidents war on terror, who may be captured or killed.
But the scale and the scope of the operations in
Iran, which involve the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and
the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), have now been
significantly expanded, according to the current and former officials. Many
of these activities are not specified in the new Finding, and some
congressional leaders have had serious questions about their nature.
Under federal law, a Presidential Finding, which is highly classified, must
be issued when a covert intelligence operation gets under way and, at a
minimum, must be made known to Democratic and Republican leaders in the
House and the Senate and to the ranking members of their respective
intelligence committees - the so-called Gang of Eight.
Money for the operation can then be reprogrammed
from previous appropriations, as needed, by the relevant congressional
committees, which also can be briefed.
The Finding was focused on undermining
Irans nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through
regime change, a person familiar with its contents said, and involved
working with opposition groups and passing money.
The Finding provided for a whole new range of
activities in southern Iran and in the areas, in the east, where Baluchi
political opposition is strong, he said.
Although some legislators were troubled by aspects of the Finding, and
there was a significant amount of high-level discussion about it,
according to the source familiar with it, the funding for the escalation was
approved.
In other words, some members of the Democratic
leadership - Congress has been under Democratic control since the 2006
elections - were willing, in secret, to go along with the Administration in
expanding covert activities directed at Iran, while the Partys presumptive
candidate for President, Barack Obama, has said that he favors direct
talks and diplomacy.
The request for funding came in the same period in which the Administration
was coming to terms with a National Intelligence Estimate (N.I.E.),
released in December, that concluded that Iran had halted its work on
nuclear weapons in 2003.
The Administration downplayed the significance of
the N.I.E., and, while saying that it was committed to diplomacy, continued
to emphasize that urgent action was essential to counter the Iranian nuclear
threat.
President Bush questioned the N.I.E.s
conclusions, and senior national-security officials, including Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice,
made similar statements. (So did Senator John McCain, the presumptive
Republican Presidential nominee.)
Meanwhile, the Administration also revived
charges that the Iranian leadership has been involved in the killing of
American soldiers in Iraq: both directly, by dispatching commando units into
Iraq, and indirectly, by supplying materials used for roadside bombs and
other lethal goods.
(There have been questions about the accuracy of the
claims; the Times, among others, has reported that significant
uncertainties remain about the extent of that involvement.)
Military and civilian leaders in the Pentagon share the White Houses
concern about Irans nuclear ambitions, but there is disagreement about
whether a military strike is the right solution. Some Pentagon officials
believe, as they have let Congress and the media know, that bombing Iran is
not a viable response to the nuclear-proliferation issue, and that more
diplomacy is necessary.
A Democratic senator told me that, late last year, in an off-the-record
lunch meeting, Secretary of Defense Gates met with the Democratic caucus in
the Senate. (Such meetings are held regularly.)
Gates warned of the consequences if the Bush
Administration staged a preemptive strike on Iran, saying, as the senator
recalled,
Well create generations of jihadists, and
our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in America.
Gatess comments stunned the Democrats at the
lunch, and another senator asked whether Gates was speaking for Bush and
Vice-President Dick Cheney.
Gatess answer, the senator told me, was,
Lets just say that Im here speaking for
myself.
(A spokesman for Gates confirmed that he
discussed the consequences of a strike at the meeting, but would not address
what he said, other than to dispute the senators characterization.)
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose chairman is Admiral Mike Mullen,
were pushing back very hard against White House pressure to undertake a
military strike against Iran, the person familiar with the Finding told me.
Similarly, a Pentagon consultant who is involved in the war on terror said
that,
at least ten senior flag and general
officers, including combatant commanders - the four-star officers who
direct military operations around the world - have weighed in on that
issue.
The most outspoken of those officers is Admiral
William Fallon, who until recently was the head of U.S. Central
Command, and thus in charge of American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In
March, Fallon resigned under pressure, after giving a series of interviews
stating his reservations about an armed attack on Iran.
For example, late last year he told the
Financial Times that the real objective of U.S. policy was to change
the Iranians behavior, and that,
attacking them as a means to get to that
spot strikes me as being not the first choice.
