Those Indymac boys were given deal by
the FDIC, and borrowers were
strong-armed.
This one is bit complex at times, but itll make your blood boil.
The
Feds
and Wall Street bankers/financiers have combined to pass laws that not
merely foreclose on people who can no longer make their mortgage payments,
but to profit handsomely from the foreclosure at the taxpayers expense.
Theyve devised a scheme (law) whereby the
bankers/financiers can buy foreclosed homes for a fraction of their original
price, sell the homes for less than their purchase price, but are still
guaranteed to make a fat profit.
This is government as gangsters...
