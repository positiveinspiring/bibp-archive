"Attempts to form a government in Greece collapsed on Tuesday,
jolting financial markets at the prospect leftists opposed to
the terms of an EU bailout could sweep to victory in a June
election and nudge the euro zone crisis into a dangerous new
phase."
CNBC
Why should the Greek people be financially destroyed and rendered destitute
by forced German and Brussels EU austerity measures and more loans designed
only to pay the interest on the debt to the big banks?
What if the banking and media establishment are
dead wrong about nations withdrawing from the Euro like they have from the
beginning of the crisis?
I suggest a strong economic recovery is the
likely result rather than depression as forecast by experts working for the
banks that have enslaved Greece.
What Would You Do?
Let's assume you were very unsophisticated regarding real estate and you
lived off a $30,000 annual income. Then assume you purchased a home in the US
during the Federal Reserve-created housing bubble for $500,000 with 2% down.
Your real estate agent and mortgage broker said,
"Don't worry. We will take care of the
details."
Later, you discover your signature was forged
and they showed your annual income as $300,000 annually.
Now you find out the real value is only $50,000 and there are numerous liens
and defects and you don't even have clear title to the asset. The bank and
credit providers are threatening to take everything you have saved in your
lifetime because you are behind on your loan payments.
What would you do?
Given this situation most rational people would
stop making payments, withdraw from the fraudulent contract and sue those
who misrepresented the entire deal for fraud. This is a very simplistic
version of what has happened to most nations inside the EU. The citizens
never voted on or understand the contract giving away national sovereignty.
The entire deal, including the sovereign debt,
was fraudulent and sold so banks and politicians could benefit.
Recovery is Only
Possible Outside the Euro and After Sovereign Debt Repudiation
Many EU member states should simply withdraw from and repudiate the failed
monetary and political experiment that the European Union has become.
In addition, Greece should repudiate the
excessive sovereign debts owed primarily to German banks and restore an
independent Greek currency, the Drachma, at a lower and more favorable
exchange rate to stimulate tourism and foreign investment. Yes, there will
be a short-term drop in the Greek economy but this would quickly be over in
contrast to the EU-created death spiral Greece has been forced to endure
over the last few years and that will continue into the future.
Despite all the warnings by the establishment, I urge the Greek people, as
well as the suffering populations of Spain, Italy, Ireland and other
nations, to dump their politicians chained to the EU and march to a
different tune on the right and left.
The world knows Greek politicians are corrupt and owned by major financial
interests.
Like most politicians in the West, they will tend to choose the near-term
course of action that provides them the most graft and payoffs. You can't
sue politicians but nations can stop paying fraudulent sovereign debts if
the people press hard enough.
History shows us that politicians can actually
on occasion even become patriots if their political future is at risk and
their financial gravy train is about to leave the station.
I believe the EU siren call for Greek austerity and bailout is just a
political disguise for more fleecing of the populace through fears of
government bankruptcy in order to steal more wealth and cut more benefits,
while the real solution for most nations is to tax and steal less and reduce
bloated programs and benefits.
The way out for Greece and most other European
nations is to withdraw from both the Euro and EU and do the above after
repudiating the sovereign debt and becoming debt-free nations.
Even Germany Will
Leave the Euro
In the final analysis I agree with my friend John Browne's forecast
Friday on CNBC.
He currently serves as Senior Market Strategist
for Euro Pacific Capital, Inc. and also as our Chairman of the Board for
Biologix Hair Inc. in Toronto.
He warned that not only would Greece and other nations withdraw from the
Euro but in the end Germany is also likely to pull out and restore the
D-Mark before the EU crisis has run its course.
The ultimate solution for all government debt is always pay off, repudiate
or hyperinflation hence the impasse in EU Land. No nation has ever paid off
their national debt, the citizens generally benefit from repudiation over
hyperinflation but central banks always use inflation as the solution.
Due
to rather recent German history the German people will never allow any
government to sanction high rates of inflation.
The EU was a vehicle designed to control all of Europe but the German people
will not stand for the massive money creation and ultimate inflation
necessary to preserve the failed European Union and inflate away the massive
sovereign debts of nations in the EU.
Maybe History Will
Repeat Itself in Reverse
Almost 100 years ago, the victorious allies and their
banking elites used
the Treaty of Versailles to plunder the wealth of Germany and its citizens,
who were no more guilty of this terrible war than were the allies.
It has
not been long enough for them to have forgotten the drift towards extremism,
anger at those who plundered their nation and finally, the rise of Hitler
and National Socialism.
The German people will surely demand withdrawal
from the Euro and a return to the currency credibility of a restored D-Mark
(Deutsche Mark) backed in some way by gold. The alternative is to risk a
return to the 1930's and the Germans have not forgotten that mistake.
I would suggest that at the next federal election in Germany in the fall of
2013 Chancellor Merkel will likely be repudiated at the polls because of the
EU problems. She and her party alliance will be forced from power as her
dream for a German-led Europe through the European Union crumbles like so
many grandiose plans of earlier empires.
Remember, 70 years earlier in 1933 another
chancellor was swept into power because of government debts, hyperinflation
and outside meddling.
It did not end well for Germany.
Get Out of the EU Now
While You Still Can Peacefully
I know many citizens across the European Union are wondering,
"How did we get here?"
They think it can't get any worse so maybe they
should remain in the EU because the establishment experts warn of
bankruptcy, currency crisis and the usual doom and gloom should the Euro be
dumped.
As an American, I know from our history that the determination of a power
elite to maintain control over taxpayer territory at any cost in terms of
lives, economic destruction and violence is always far stronger than the
public realizes. We are now celebrating the 150th anniversary of our Civil
War that destroyed the Southern economy for a century and killed 600,000
Americans, North and South.
No, it wasn't really a civil war and the media establishment never mentions
the death toll of the war. Also, the major causes of the war that had more
to do with the establishment of a central bank, railroad profits and
government revenue have been hidden from view.
But the winners always write the history and unless individual European
nations get out of the European Union modeled on the American Union quickly,
your nations may never leave without a war you are likely to lose.
So get out of the Euro and EU now while you
still can.
