Trying not to burst his bubble, but by giving
the short-list of particulars about the book biz, and by relating the war
stories of trying to break inconvenient truths, I gently try to introduce
some reality into the long-shot dream.
Well, here is a book that has already changed
the world and is already a best-seller.
Daniel Estulins dogged pursuit of
what the worlds political and financial leaders have been talking about at
their annual secret conclaves - the Bilderberg Group meetings - has lead to
astounding revelations, spot-on predictions of world events and a scrambling
feverish attempt to blot out the light that Daniel has shone inside the
shroud of secrecy: where world events are playthings, Presidents are chosen,
wars formatted, energy markets manipulated, and more
all with major press
attending, but never reporting.
Looking into secret matters is never easy, nor
is dealing with the bias one must slog through. The mainstream media have,
until recently, barely mentioned the Group. Meanwhile, the Bildergerg Group
has become a bogeyman of the fringe, where their reputation may, in fact, be
well deserved. We have done our best to be accurate; rosters are fluid,
Boards of Directors change, etc.
To me, the real questions are:
What are these wise men doing that demands
such extreme secrecy? and, Where are they taking us?
When the Groups actions are put into historical
con text, as Daniel has done, one can begin to understand the apparent scope
of what they intend, and why they need such a high level of hush to
implement it.
That there are such things as national and
personal sovereignty, and the attendant human freedoms and liberties
standing in the way of their stated objectives, see ms of little consequence
to them. I stand with Daniel and most people of the world for the true
democratic ideals of our Republic, not the current cryptocratic rule,
of the elite, by the stooges and for the
corporations.
I am sure that most of the Bilderberg Group feel
that their stealthy road to a secret future has been paved with good
intentions. But, it just may be that many of us, like myself , dont really
want to go to... there.

This may be the most difficult part of the book
to write, because the list of collaborators, independent researchers, in and
out of government sources, private investigators, U.S. Army, Navy and Air
Force analysts, Spanish Generals, cooks, chefs, bellboys, cleaning persons,
waiters and waitresses at Bilderberger hotels, who have wholeheartedly given
of their energies and time, overlooking the dangers that such meetings could
cause them, is simply too long to mention on the pages of my book, or rather
our book, because I am the vehicle of the collective psyche of a society
whose natural instinct spells freedom.
I extend my sincerest and deeply felt gratitude
to numerous members of international secret service agencies in Washington,
London, Moscow, Madrid, Paris, Caracas, Rome and Ottawa, whose inside
knowledge on intelligence issues and wisdom often kept my spirits up in the
darkest of hours.
Without their priceless intelligence gathering,
this book would have forever remained an unrealizable dream. Special thanks
go out to Canada, my country, who gave our family home and hope for a better
future without asking for anything in return. I repaid that debt of
gratitude in 1996 when I uncovered the Bilderbergers diabolical plans for
Canadas breakup.
My love goes out to Canadas wonderful and
decent and freedom loving people who that fateful year answered my desperate
plea for help by taking to the streets en masse to re soundingly destroy
Bilderberger hopes of silently breaking up Canada. When I nee d uplifting, I
think of these people and their faith in the goodness of Men.
A note of gratitude to the good Fortune and infinite Faith, who have never
left my side, who kept me ploughing away one centimeter at a time, even when
there was no hope and no energy to spare. In the most desperate of moments I
made it through because I believed in my two Fs.
Thanks to my friend John Harraghy and his wisdom
- a man who belongs to an unrepeatable generation of truly great men - an d
to Geoffrey Matthews from Amherst Island, Ontario, Canada, the man who for
years has been at the helm of the best newspaper in the country, the
legendary Eye Opener.
To all those kind, faceless people who have sent
me tens of thousands of emails making me believe there were some things to
look forward to in life. I dedicate this book to all those who have never
stopped searching for the truth, in the face of government lies, cheating,
manipulation and deceit. To those who have intuitively felt that blasphemous
lies we are told are but a vile whiff of hatred.
All these people deserve to know the truth about
our history and heritage . History teaches by analogy, not rigorous proof.
The historical experience is not one of staying in the present and looking
back. Rather it is one of going back into the past and returning to the
present with a wider and more intense consciousness of the restrictions of
our former outlook.
Finally, I owe the success o f this book to
Bonnie Toews, my first editor of this manuscript, and to Trine Days own
Russ Becker, without whose vision and sure hand this book would have been
a pale version of its present, better self. And finally, to Kris Millegan.
Kris , you defended this work and the truth, and the entire world owes you a
debt of gratitude. Your belief that this book was important convinced
others. They believed because you believed. And I believed because I saw you
believe. Mankind is y et to pass a final judgment.
Miracles, as someone said, can happen without
our permission. This book and all the people who made it happen are living
proof of that.

Author's afterward
Hotel des Iles Borromees, on the shores of Lake Maggiore in Stresa, Italy,
site of 2004 Bilderberg meeting.
In 1954, the most powerful men in the world met for the first time under the
auspices of the Dutch royal crown and the Rockefeller family at the
luxurious Hotel Bilderberg in the small Dutch town of Oosterbeek. For an
entire weekend, they de bated the future of the world. When it was over,
they decided to meet once every year to exchange ideas and analyze
international affairs.
They named themselves the Bilderberg Group.
Since then, they have gathered yearly in a luxurious hotel somewhere in the
world to try to decide the future of humanity. Among the select members of
this club are Bill Clinton, Paul Wolfowitz, Henry Kissinger, David
Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Tony Blair and many other heads of
government , businessmen, politicians, bankers and journalists from all over
the world.
Nevertheless, in the more than fifty years of
their meetings, the press has never been allowed to attend, no statements
have ever been released on the attendees conclusions, nor has any agenda
for a Bilderberg meeting been made public.
Leaders of the Bilderberg Group argue that this
discretion is necessary to allow participants in the debates to speak freely
without being on the record, or reported publicly. Otherwise, Bilderbergers
claim, they would be forced to speak in the language of a press release. No
doubt, this discretion allows the Bilderberg Group to deliberate more
freely.
But that does not respond to the fundamental
question:
-
What do the worlds most powerful people
talk about in these meetings?
-
Any modern democratic system protects
the right to privacy, but doesnt the public have a right to know
what their political leaders are talking about when they meet the
wealthiest business leaders of their respective countries?
-
What guarantees do citizens have that
the Bilderberg Group isnt merely a center for influence trafficking
and lobbying if they arent allowed to know what their
representatives talk about at the Groups secret gatherings?
-
Why are the Davos World Economic Forums
and G8 meetings discussed in every newspaper, given front-page
coverage, with thousands of journalists in attendance, while no one
covers Bilderberg Group meetings?
This blackout exists despite the fact that (or
because?) they are annually attended by Presidents of the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and Federal Reserve.
Also by chairmen of 100 of the most powerful
corporations in the world such as,
-
Daimler Chrysler, Coca Cola, British
Petroleum (BP), Chase Manhattan Bank, American Express, Goldman
Sachs, and Microsoft
-
by Vice Presidents of the United States
-
Directors of the CIA and the FBI
-
Secretaries General of NATO
-
American Senators and members of
Congress
-
European Prime Ministers
-
leaders of opposition parties
-
top editors and CEOs of the
leading newspapers in the world
It is certainly curious that no mainstream media
outlet considers a gathering of such figures, whose wealth far exceeds the
combined wealth of all United States citizens, to be newsworthy, when a trip
by any one of them on their own makes headline news on TV. This is the
conundrum that I have pondered. Fifteen years ago it set me on an
investigative journey that has become my lifes work.
Slowly, one by one, I have penetrated the layers
of secrecy surrounding the Bilderberg Group, but I could not have done this
without the help of conscientious objectors from inside, as well as
outside, the Groups membership.
To them, I extend my deepest gratitude for their
priceless intelligence has made this book possible. You can understand then,
that to protect them, I cannot mention these true heroes by name, only thank
them for helping me find out what was being said behind the closed doors of
the opulent hotels where the Bilderbergers hold their annual meetings.
Before we enter the realm of this exclusive
club, it is important to recognize that neither people nor organizations are
absolutely evil, just as no one is absolutely good.
There are powerful people in the world guide d
by higher ideals, principles and beliefs than those of the manipulative
secret club and its spin-offs that I describe in this book. The efforts of
the original members to better our world were based on a father-knows-best
autocracy similar to the Roman Catholic Churchs paternalistic form of
Christianity.
Their intent was noble, at first. Unfortunately,
it seems that the Bilderberg Group has grown beyond its idealistic
beginnings to become a shadow world government, which xiv decides in total
secrecy at annual meetings how their plans are to be carried out.
They threaten to take away our right to direct
our own destinies. And this is becoming easier, because the development of
telecommunication technology, merge d with profound instant impact of the
Internet and new methods of behavior engineering to manipulate individual
conduct, may convert what, at other epochs of hi story, were only evil
intentions - into a disturbing reality.
Each new measure, viewed on its own, may seem
only a slight aberration, but a whole host of change s, as part of an
ongoing continuum, constitutes a shift towards total enslavement. This is
why it is time to look behind the scenes. We are at a crossroads. And the
roads we take from here will determine the very future of humanity. We have
to wake up to the true objectives and actions of the Bilderberg Group and
its parallel kin if we hope to retain the freedoms fought for by our
grandfathers in World War II.
It is not up to God to bring us back from the
New Dark Age planned for us. It is up to us! Whether we emerge from this
century as an electronic global police state or as free human beings depends
on the actions we take now. We will never find the right answers if we dont
know the deep context.
This is what The True Story of the Bilderberg
Group endeavors to provide.

Part 1
Deadly drop
On May 1996 I was in Toronto covering the annual Bilderberg meeting, but
this time on my home ground in my adopted land of Canada. It felt good to be
back, and I was reminded of so many reasons why I love this country.
Toronto, home to over five million people, is
the largest financial center in Canada and the fourth largest city in North
America. Only New York, Chicago and Los Angeles have larger economies. The
Toronto Stock Exchange is here. It is the third largest in North America in
trading value, ninth in the world in quoted market value, and it has the
first fully computerized trading system in North America.
Within an hours drive of Toronto are the
greatest concentrations of automobile manufacturing and horse breeding in
the country. I would be heading north to the site of this years Bilderberg
Conference in a short while, but first I wanted to enjoy wandering through
the city streets, reacquainting myself with the wonderful sights so man y
Canadians take for granted.
Downtown, in the heart of Torontos financial
district, is Bay Street, which is Torontos diminutive version of New Yorks
famous Wall Street. At 161 Bay Street stands the Canada Trust Tower. This
53-story, 856 -foot tower is one of the citys signature skyscrapers, and it
has fascinated me since its construction in 1990 by a famed Spanish
architect, Santiago Calatrava .
This tower forms part of the 5.2 acre BCE Place,
the second most distinctive sight on Torontos skyline, after the CN Tower
which, at 1,820 feet above the ground, is the worlds highest freestanding
structure.
BCE Place is actually several buildings connected by a shopping mall, but
from a skyline perspective, it is the Canada Trust Tower and its sister, the
Bay Wellington Tower, that steal the show. With tinted green windows and
myriad jagged edges, the two towers present an artistic impression of
staggered Lego blocks stacked at angles to defy gravity, giving the pair
uniqueness among Torontos more sedate skyscrapers.
Another jewel in the BCE crown is the Galleria,
a five-story hall of light that runs along Front Street and faces south
toward the waterfront district. The Galleria was designed as a Crystal
Cathedral of commerce, with the roof providing cover for the Street
Gallery, which connects Bay Street to Heritage Square. Also designed by
Santiago Calatrava, it is 85 feet high, 46 feet wide, and 394 feet from end
to end, and is composed of eight freestanding steel supports on either side
of the Gallery.
They branch out into parabolic shapes, which at
that moment reminded me of a forest canopy.
Eventually I strolled up Yonge Street - the
worlds longest street, almost 1,200 miles long. Just up the road, 22 miles
north by northwest of the downtown core, the Bilderberg elite were gathering
at the CIBC Leadership Centre near the pristine town of King City, the site
of the 1996 Bilderberg Conference. The CIBC retreat/resort is in King Towns
hip - a region of large, expensive horse farms, where members of the British
Roy al Family are hosted on their private visits to Canada.
This marvelous center, privately owned by one of
Canadas main banks, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, includes over
three miles of nature trails through forested terrain and rolling hills. It
was no wonder that the Bilderbergers had decided on this exquisite location.
From spa facilities and services featuring massage and skincare/aesthetic
treatments, saunas, and steam-rooms; to a unique 200meter indoor fully
heated track suspended roughly six feet above the ground; to indoor and
outdoor swimming and whirlpools, the CIBC Leadership Centre has it all.
It is also locate d near numerous golf courses,
riding stables, hiking and cycling routes, museums and other recreation
sites. In sum, there was little chance that the Bilderbergers would get
bored. The Toronto media and news services had been first alerted to this
meeting by a series of faxes, phone calls and memos from me and Jim Tucker,
especially after it became known to me from deep undercover sources with in
the meeting that the 1996 conference was allegedly to be used as a staging g
round for the imminent breakup of Canada.
This was to be secured through a Unilateral
Declaration of Independence in Quebec, to be launched in early 1997. The
declaration would fragment Canada, with the aim of achieving Continental
Union with the U.S. by 2000, a date which has been pushed back at least
twice since then. As a general rule, Bilderberg meetings are never mentioned
in the media, since the mainstream press is fully owned by the
Bilderbergers. But the veil of secrecy was abruptly torn off on May 30,
1996, the first day of the conference.
A front-page story ran in one of Canadas most
widely read and influential newspapers, the Toronto Star. Under the headline
Black plays host To world leaders, John Deverell, a business
reporter for the newspaper, noted that not only had Canadian publisher
[Lord] Conrad Black offered $295 million to gain control of Canadas
largest newspaper chain and then weathered the subsequent annual meeting of
his Hollinger Inc., but also, to cap his week, he was now,
the host for a four-d ay, closely guarded
meeting of world leaders and royalty just north of Toronto.
Deverell named some of the more than 100
hand-picked attendees from around the world from the list we had supplied
him:
U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry; Prime
Minister Jean Chretien of Canada; former U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger; Giovanni Agnelli, Honorary Chairman of Fiat; Finance Minister
[and later Canadas Prime Minister] Paul Martin; Mario Monto, European
Commissioner; David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan Bank; George Soros,
Prince of Belgium, the queen s of the Netherlands and Spain as well as
other business, political and academic elite.
That same day, the Toronto Sun headlined,
Big hitters gather: vast array of
international VIPs Talk Things over at Secretive Bilderberg 96 in king
City, and noted that [Conrad] Black, media baron and chairman of
Hollinger Inc., and other permanent members of the group, are unhappy at
suggestions by extremists of the left and right that the private event
is part of a system of secret government.
At 7:45 that morning, 680-NEWS legendary radio
journalist, Dick Smythe, who had the widest metro Toronto audience,
presented the following report, which was re-aired at intervals as part of
the stations news schedule:
Dick Smythe: Well, this sounds like the plot
from a conspiracy movie, as the worlds movers and shakers meet in
secret. Conrad Black is holding his annual Bilderberg Conference. Heres
680s Karen Parsons ...
Reporter: About one hundred notables,
including the Queens of the Netherlands and Spain, along with Henry
Kissinger, the U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and our Prime
Minister, have gathered for the conference. Also along, the heads of
Ford Motor Company, Xerox, the Bank of Commerce and Reuters. Black says
there is a ban on reporters, so discussion will be intimate and candid.
He says,
Exchanges can often be quite heated.
Participants are required to take a vow of
silence. Last years conference was held in three mountaintop luxury hotels
in Switzerland.
This year, it s at a $60 million dollar luxury
spa in King City. The Canadian Press has also distributed a brief report on
the previously-secret meeting, which was published today by, among other
newspapers, the Toronto Sun, with over 350,000 subscribers. This was the
first time in the history of the Bilderberg Conferences that the y had ever
been scrutinized in such a fashion.
Bilderbergers are not accustomed to having to
provide explanations to anyone, particularly since members own or control
major metropolitan newspapers, newspaper chains and wire services. However,
1996 was no ordinary conference. The Bilderbergers do not typically plot the
overthrow of their host countrys government during their meetings.
When the principal news outlets began checking
our information through their own government and private sources, it became
clear that Canada, one of the worlds wealthiest countries, was scheduled to
be ruthlessly partitioned by the Bilderbergers and t he New World Order.
They should have known that when their own freedom is at stake, no amount of
ownership of the press would prevent secretaries, copy editors, writers,
investigative journalists and, indeed, management of 6 Canadas television,
radio and print media from disseminating the truth for public consumption.
The press coverage became so intense that
Kissinger was overhear d by one of the staff reporters screaming at the
Canadian Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, that he would be damned if someone
was going to screw this up for him. David Rockefeller pulled Conrad Black
aside during a break to ask him if he could lean on some people in the
press to get them to shut up about this.
Even then, the now disgraced and bankrupt Conrad
Black was in way over his head. What the Bilderbergers imagined being a
trickle had quickly turned into a flood and t hen an avalanche. Not until
the 1999 Conference in Sintra, Portugal, did the Bilderbergers relax the
extraordinary security measures that followed in the footsteps of their
worst defeat, the 1996 Conference in Toronto. On June 1, Big Jim Tucker
and I, along with a small cadre of part-time Bilderberg chasers, celebrated
what was turning into an extraordinary success story.
Every major newspaper i n the country wanted an
interview, television stations were constantly looking f or updates, and
radio stations were following us all over the city. We gathered at the
Horseshoe Tavern on Queen Street, Torontos version of New Yorks Soho
district. The Horseshoe Tavern, now some 60 years old, is one of the citys
origin al music venues, the famous bar where Canadian singing legends
Stompin Tom, Blue Rodeo, The Tragically Hip and The Watchmen got their
first breaks.
In September 1997, the Rolling Stones would kick
off their No Security tour there, with a 7 5-minute show for Live on MTV.
It is a good place to have a good time, and we felt well deserving of it. As
the festivities began to wind down, I pondered my approaching appointment,
made during a phone call from one of my sources, who wanted urgently to see
me before the end of the conference scheduled for the following day.
We had agreed to meet in less than an hour at
Calatravas Galleria. BC E Place is one of the most inconspicuous places in
all of Toronto precisely because of its immensity, with droves of tourist
gawkers passing through the premise s photographing and videotaping the
sights and sounds of Torontos premier architectural attraction. Our party
was now definitely breaking up, and I decided to walk to the Galleria
through Kensington Market, a Toronto version of Madrids Rastro, located
just west of Chinatown.
It was Saturday, which is the busiest day of the
week, when it becomes a bustling open-air market. If anyone were to follow
me, I would surely lose the tail in this matrix of busy streets and densely
packed crowds. As I rounded the corner at the Galleria, I could see my
contact browsing the newspaper stand, a plastic bag in left hand and his
other holding a rolled up magazine.
After a chance eye contact, and without
acknowledging each others presence, we moved silently towards the revolving
entrance of the adjacent Canada Trust Tower, where a friend who worked for
the real estate developer had arranged a room overlooking the city skyline
on one of the top floors. I walked into an elevator, nervously glancing
behind me.
My contact was to follow me five minutes later.
As I entered the posh suite, the splendor of one of North Americas most
beautiful cities opened up and stood majestically before me. From 800 feet
above ground, the city stood still. I was shut off from the bustle and
sounds of this great metropolis by soundproof windows. The Canada Trust
Tower is an architectural marvel where a square meter of space rents out for
160 Canadian dollars.
The building is equipped with 24-hour CCTV
surveillance cameras, 24 elevators, eight levels of underground parking,
seven security guards at the entrance, plus undercover police. The
skyscraper is home to some of the most established and successful
multinational corporations in the world. All of a sudden, I once again felt
on the outside looking in.
Would all this continue to make a difference?
Would people wake up to the imminent danger? Or would this, in the longer
run, be just another cloak-and-dagger experience?
After all, Have a nice day, son had been the
reply of one passerby, after I had patiently explained to him just who was
visiting and what they were up to. Nonetheless, much had been accomplished
in these last several days. For once, we clearly had the upper hand on the
Bilderbergers. Press coverage was tremendous. Kissinger was royally pissed
off : definitively a good sign.
To their chagrin, attending European royalty
were hounded by unwanted press. The plans for the imminent breakup of my
adopted country were temporarily put on hold. What else could one hope to
achieve in such a short time? Still, I knew that this was a temporary
reprieve. These people would b e back, lessons learned and notes taken. They
wanted to crush any 8 resistance, to rule the world with or without its
consent, with guns or butter, without
My thoughts were interrupted by a discreet knock
on the heavy wooden door.
Come in, I replied, only slightly raising
my voice.
My Source, wearing leather gloves, slowly
crossed the threshold that separated the lightly decorated hallway from the
heavy art deco of the suite. Contemplating for a moment the extraordinary
view of the downtown Harbor Front area surrounded by lakeside promenades and
landscaped waterfront pathways, he moved appreciatively toward the window.
You stopped them this time around, said
the Source, weighing every syllable as if even a slight alteration in
the register might have transmitted a different meaning.
Despite his words, he projected an aura of
resignation.
The breakup of Canada will go ahead as
planned. It is only a matter of time.
Maybe, I said. But all is well, for now,
until the next close encounter. Between now and then, quite a few of
them will have died of old age, disease and fortuitous accidents.
Fortuitous? For whom? replied the Source.
He pulled out hand-written notes, or rather
scribbles that I despaired of deciphering on my own, from the magazine he
was tightly gripping with his right hand.
I thought note taking wasnt allowed, I
quipped, displaying a full smile at him.
Note taking is discouraged, my friend, he
corrected me.
I glanced at the page.
The familiar hand of a fountain pen had left a
blotchy imprint here and there, but, overall, I realized I could understand
it. I knew quite well the Sources writing, his faint Ts and crooked Rs,
diligently drawn out within the confines of a lined paper. I reflected
momentarily upon what this courageous person was risking in meeting me and
handing me this priceless information. Why werent there more people like
this in the world? But perhaps there are.
We may simply not know them, or the personal
struggles they may be waging thousands of miles away. For example, there are
the many everyday people who have enabled me to acquire much of my
information. 9
I would arrive at the site of a Bilderberg meeting several days ahead of
them, stay at the same five-star luxury hotel until their security forces
along with the arrival of Bilderberg guests kicked me out one day before the
start of their conference. During my time in the hotel, I would get to know
the waitresses, waiters and general staff.
Those who seemed more open I approached and
explained how the Bilderberg meeting worked, what this secretive group was
about and what would take place in the hotel over the next few days. Of
course many didnt believe me, but I would beg them not to take me at my
word, just to watch what happened in their hotel and to listen to the
conversations of the Bilderberg guests as t hey served them.
Then they could decide if they wanted to be my
eyes and ears, f or the good of humanity. I was taking advantage of all
five-star hotel policies: staff and employees must speak a minimum of four
languages - English, French, German and one more - to accommodate guests.
They could discreetly eavesdrop and understand most of what was discussed
through the conference.
As days went by, t hose I approached witnessed
the police presence, secret service, and secrecy of the attendees, and came
to believe that what I had told them was true. For the few who decided to
help me, I would designate several local bars where we could meet
inconspicuously. This insider, of course, required a more secure meeting
place I have to go, the Source said quietly without looking up.
I mechanically ex tended my open hand in his
direction, but just as the Source was about to clasp it with his
outstretched palm, I found myself giving him a bear hug instead.
I wont waste your time thanking you,
because no amount of thanks can be enough for what you have been doing
for us.
The Source looked away.
I have to leave.
Well leave as we came up, I said, in
five minute intervals. Ill go down first.
Dont bother. I left my car in the
underground parking. We can take the elevator down together, replied
the Source.
Pulling on his leather gloves, he pressed the
elevator button. A blue light shone through its transparent surface. I could
hear the whooshing sounds of the hydraulic lift speeding towards us from the
bowels of the building at six levels per second.
I turned toward my informant.
When will I see you
next? 10
With the sound of the bell, the doors opened, and I took a step in that
direction.
Watch out!! screamed the Source, grabbing
my arm and yanking me back.
I stared at the elevator. In front of me, a
chilling spectacle
an empty elevator shaft with certain death awaiting me
some 650 feet below, had the Source lacked the reflexes to pull me back from
the abyss.
I shuddered all over. Cold chills ran up and
down my spine in rapid succession.
The floor, I muttered, barely perceiving.
Where is the floor?
We have to get out of here! said the
Source.
Someone has jimmied the system. They have
been expecting you! Listen, he said. Dont take the elevator. It
isnt safe. Walk down the stairs and call the police. When they get
here, Ill take advantage of the moment and take the elevator down to
the garage. Go! Do it now!
Skipping the stairs two at a time, I propelled
myself around the stairwell corners with short pushes of my hands against
the walls, galvanized with adrenaline, flying down the stairs in record
time.
I could feel my heart pounding against my chest
wall and gasped for more oxygen. On one of the lower floors, I heard the
garbled voice of a foreign-born security guard climbing the stairs towards
me.
...Er, ...ter, ...mister, sir. Are you all
right? What happened? I was called on the intercom on the second floor
someone manually to made elevator stop ... only in emergency can to do
this.
I grabbed the mans forearm.
Could you please call the police as quickly
as you can? I said , while catching my breath between every other word.
The man pulled out his walkie-talkie, and I
could hear a high-pitched voice coming through from the other end of the
line. I ran on. Five, four, three, two, one
ground level.
I pushed o pen the heavy metal doors that opened
on the main lobby. Two police cruisers were already parked outside. The
first onlookers were beginning to gather on the other side of the revolving
entrance doors.
Are you the man who got stuck in the
elevator? asked the Toronto police constable, pointing at me with his
fat index and middle finger.
Not exactly, I muttered shaking my head in
virtual disbelief. I was about to enter into an elevator that was
missing its principle component, the floor.
The cop gave a short cry. A stocky companion
with sharp feature s, clipped moustache and hairy wrist glanced over. 11
You know, son, you are very lucky to be
alive.
The policeman stood with his knees slightly
opened, his shoe tips pointing outwards.
Usually only blind people survive these
situations. A blind man would never step into an elevator without
checking to see if it is there. Most of us take it for granted. When the
Mafia want someone rubbed out, this is one of their preferred methods.
On June 1, 1996, I was about to turn thirty,
too young to die.
Fuck them, I thought. This is far from over. We
can still win this. I gave the pertinent details to the constable, who
looked at me incredulously from time to time, his eyes focused on the lower
part of my face as if he were lip reading. A security guard with an
impeccably bald dome and slightly clipped hair asked me once again if I was
all right.
Several people on the sidewalk recalled seeing a
stocky man in his forties walk out of the building some five minutes before
the police had arrived. A police van and two more policemen on motorcycles
pulled up. Yes, yes, the show had begun. It was the crowds turn to take
center stage. The wrong people remembered the right things, and vice versa.
A fat lady, who refused a chocolate candy because she was on a diet, gave
a lurid account of how she saw someone, or maybe something, walk, or perhaps
stumble
A street violinist remembered two men carrying a
medium-sized piano out of the building
A young lady with a poodle
. But
whatever these people may or may not have seen of relevance to the crime,
their hopes were now to participate somehow. Yes, yes, and participate they
did, that large crowd of well-wishers and onlookers and gawkers and
charlatans. Put the pen away. The show is over.
You sir, downstage, put your glasses back on!
Officer, stop scribbling into your pad! Ladies and gentlemen, please, could
I have you all put your personal belongings back into your imaginary
suitcases and leave the premises? The show is over!
A tramp stuck a half-eaten cigar into his mouth.
A thin dapperish man with long sideburns slowly walked by pretending not to
notice, not even turning his head. Two hotdog vendors gloomily pushed their
sausages over so me tram tracks, back across the street, shooed away by the
beat cop with a deprecatory shake of his head. 12
I walked the other way, the same way I had
approached. The first of June is summer in Andalusia, but here summer was
still two months away. A distinctly Russian man with a hedgehog haircut
walked by hand-in-hand with a lady, complaining a bout the eating habits of
someone named Vania.
He reminded me of the land of my birth. He also
reminded me of the man who had drawn me into all of this in the first place.
The highlander, 1992
My involvement with the secret society called the Bilderberg Group had begun
on a fall day in October 1992, with a telephone call from a Russian émigré
based in Paris.
He had read an earlier story about my familys
plight in a New York based Russian daily newspaper, written on the tenth
anniversary of our forced exile, and he wished to meet to discuss a certain
matter of great importance.
Several weeks later, we met at Segovia, a
well-known Spanish restaurant in Toronto located just off Yonge Street. When
I made that fateful decision to meet the man whose identity will remain
anonymous, but whom we shall simply call Vladimir, I entered into a
parallel universe where red meant go and green meant shoot, and yellow and
blue and orange and any other color simply didnt exist.
It was a world utterly counterintuitive, and
unfamiliar to all but a select few who somehow had had a brush or a
connection with the underworld of spooks and counter-espionage . This
parallel world remains unseen in the daily struggles of most of humanity,
but, believe me, it is there: a cesspool of duplicity and lies and
doublespeak and innuendo and blackmail and bribery.
It is a surreal world of double and trip le
agents, of changing loyalties, of professional psychotic assassins,
brainwashed black ops agents, soldiers of fortune and mercenaries, whose
primary sources of income are the dirtiest and most despicable
government-run subversive mission s - the kind that can never be exposed.
These people spend their entire lives dancing between raindrops and
disappearing at the faintest whiff of danger. As much as most people
BilderBerg foundation
Imagine a private club where presidents, prime ministers, international
bankers and generals rub shoulders, where gracious royal chaperones ensure
everyone gets along, and where the people running the wars, the markets and
Europe say what they never dare say in public.
This is the Bilderberg Group, and it is the most
secretive of any organization worldwide. The reason that no one is willing
to break the groups conspiracy of silence or stand up to it is revealed in
the words of French broadcaster Thierry de Segonzac:
The Bilderbergers are too powerful an d
omnipresent to be exposed.
The secrecy of the Bilderbergers has captured
the imaginations of novelists such as Robert Ludlum and Gayle Lynds.
Their books mod el covert organizations based on
the few facts published about the Bilderberg Group. These novels illustrate
the fact that whenever a regime change is needed, anywhere worldwide -
whether this be based on the need to sustain a welfare state or to correct
destabilizing capital flows - it only happens when a world body o f power
brokers decides to address the issues and posts them on its agenda.1
The Netherlands Prince Bernhard subscribed to
the belief that severe economic dips like the Great Depression could be
avoided if responsible and influential leaders could actually manage world
events behind their necessary public posturing.
For this reason, he was asked to organize the
first meeting of like-minded representatives from all facets of the
worlds economic, political, industrial and military realms in 1954. They
met at the Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek, Holland Bilderberg regulars
Henry Kissinger and Henry Kravis carried on extensive discussions
at Bilderberg 2004.
Henrys wife, Marie-Josée (shown here with
Kissinger) is one of the very few wives that regularly attend the meetings.
Do Kissinger and Kravis make investments based upon their insider knowledge
of Bilderberg discussions and decisions?
Bilderberg Bedfellows
It is important to distinguish between active members who assist annually
and others who are only invited occasionally.
About eighty members are regulars who have
attended for many years. Fringe people, who are invited to report on
subjects related to their sphere of influence or professional and academic
knowledge, are clueless about the formal structure behind the Bilderberg
Group, and remain in absolute ignorance of the Groups greater goals and
universal objectives.
A select few are invited because Bilderbergers
think they may be useful tools in their globalist plan and are later helped
to reach very powerful elected positions. One-time invitees who fail to
impress, however, are cast aside. The most dramatic example of a useful
recruit was the obscure governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, who attended
his first Bilderberg meeting at Baden-Baden, Germany, in 1991.
There, David Rockefeller told Clinton why the
North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a Bilderberg priority and
that the group needed him to support it.
The next year, Clinton was elected
President, and - guess what? - he was a strong proponent of NAFTA.
The following list tracks the coincidences
between the date s of some major leaders attendance at a Bilderberg meeting
and the dates of their subsequent career moves:
Bill Clinton: attended the Bilderberg
meeting in 1991; won the Democratic Partys nomination and was elected
President in 1992.

Relations (CFR) talks on the phone. Diplomat/Investment banker Richard
Holbrooke is in the back with a glass.
Bilderberg objectives
The Bilderbergers are searching for the age of post-nationalism: when we
wont have countries, but rather regions of Earth surrounded by Universal
values.
That is to say, a global economy, one World
government (selected rather than elected) and a universal religion. To
assure themselves of reaching these objectives, the Bilderbergers focus on
a,
greater technical approach and less
awareness on behalf of the general public.20
- William Shannon
The Bilderberg Groups chief fear is organized
resistance.
Members do not want the common people of the
world to figure out what they are planning for the world s future: mainly,
a One World Government (World Company) with a single, global marketplace,
policed by one world army, and financially regulated by one World Bank
using one global currency. How the Bilderbergers intend to achieve their On
e World vision is outlined in the following wish list.
They want: One International Identity.
By empowering international bodies to completely
destroy all national identity through subversion from within, they intend to
establish one set of universal values. No others will be allowed to flourish
in the future.
* Centralized Control of the People. By means of
mind control, they plan to direct all humanity to obey their wishes. The
blueprint of their plan is chillingly
Bilderberg puppets
From the start of his political career as governor of California, Ronald
Reagan distanced himself from tough, old-time traditionalists and put
Rockefeller men in as his key advisors.
By his 1980 presidential election, those who
thought conservative, traditional America had won could not have imagined
how wrong they we re. Though Reagan promised, if elected, to dismiss the
Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul A. Volcker, because of his
anti-inflation policy, Reagan broke his word, to the disbelief of the
conservative wing of the Republican Party, once he took office.
By coincidence or not, Anthony Wedgewood Benn, a
member of the British Parliament told members of the Socialist International
meeting in Washington on December 8, 1980,
You can thrive under Volckers credit
collapse if you profile [translation: brainwash] Reagan to intensify the
credit collapse.
These comments bring several questions
immediately to mind:
-
What did Benn mean?
-
Was he implying someone had influence
over Ronald Reagan?
-
Why would Reagan break his word to his
own party?
-
Why did he favor Rockefeller advisors to
the exclusion of others on his personal team?
One of Reagans insiders was Peter Vickers
Hall, a man known to be a top Fabianist in the U.S., and a member of the
Tavistock Institute for Human Relations, a Bilderberg-affiliated
organization.
In 1981, Hall made this speech:
There are two Americas. One is the
nineteenth century, heavy, industry-based society. The other is the
growing post-industrial...
Watergate con game
The Watergate crisis is a case of mistaken identity and a travesty of
justice.
The truth behind Watergate has never been
revealed, but those who orchestrated the overthrow of the Shah, the war in
the Falklands, the death of Aldo Moro and the downfall of Margaret Thatcher
are again implicated. Do we know for sure that Richard Nixon abused his
presidential powers? What if the smoking gun and the damning evidence of
abuse were manufactured?
Pat Nixon always claimed her husband was framed,
and believed history will eventually vindicate him. According to my sources,
who attended Bilderberg conferences in the early 1970s, the role of the
Washington Post newspaper was to keep the heat on Nixon by releasing one
revelation after another, thereby engendering a climate of public distrust
of President Nixon.
Top level British Secret Intelligence Service
intelligence analyst, John Coleman, in his book,
Conspirators Hierarchy,
directly pointed his finger at Katherine Graham, the publisher of the
Washington Post from 1963 to 1993, and accused her of murdering her husband, Philip L. Graham, a case the FBI has officially classed as suicide.
He alleges that she killed her husband just so s
he could take control of the newspaper.
Whats more interesting is that such
a g rave accusation never garnered a civil suit for libeling the now dead
multimillionaires (and confirmed Bilderberg member). Those who have studied
the Bilderbergers and their system of protections believe that to address
the charges would give Coleman more credence, and Katherine Grahams family,
friends and associates have no intention of doing that.
They have chosen the Bilderberg unmasked Thomas
Jefferson, one of the Founding Fathers of American democracy explained it
this way:
Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to
the accidental opinion of a day; but a series of oppressions, begun at a
distinguished period, and pursued unalterably through every change of
ministers [Presidents], too plainly prove a deliberate systematical plan
of reducing us to slavery.
The deep attitude of the global, mostly male,
corporate gang was expressed by David Rockefeller at the June 1991
Bilderberg meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany, where he argued for,
supra national sovereignty of an
intellectual elite and world bankers, which is surely preferable to the
national auto determination practiced in past centuries.26
On December 9, 2001, Professor John McMurtry of
the University of Guelph in Canada said this in his opening address at a
Forum entitled How Should Canada Respond To Terrorism and War?:
As such a structure of world rule, it is
accomplished by the same financial and media system deciders as put Tony
Blair into office in Britain and George W. Bush into the White House
against a majority vote. Trans -national corporations have marketed and
financed these political leaders to ensure that captive states serve
them rather than the peoples governments are elected by, guaranteeing
through state plenipotentiaries and trans-national trade edicts that
governments can no longer govern them in common interest without
infringing the new trade and investment laws in which trans-national
corporations alone are granted rights.

Part 2
Hit or miss, 1999
Empires, as any Russian can readily attest, come and go. About twenty-five
hundred years ago, one such upstart venture we call Roman began as a
swindle of its sister states, known to history as the Latin League.
Eventually, most of the Latins received a
second-class form of citizenship: the so-called Latin rights. The original
region of Latium is now known as Lazio, where my family and I had lived, in
Ladispoli. In the first week of November 1999 I received what looked to be a
postcard from an acquaintance from that small town on the Mediterranean
coast in the province of Rome.
The card simply said,
Having a good time. Wish you were here.
It was dated November 29, 1999, and signed, Fashoda.
Obviously there was something terribly wrong
with this apparently innocent holiday memento. In addition, the Italian
postcard was posted with a French stamp
and sealed wit h a March 30, 1980
seal! Anyone in the intelligence business will tell you immediately that
dates and places hold a tremendous significance to spooks and their
couriers. March 30, 1980 was the date my family officially left the Soviet
Union.
While in Italy, we had settled in Ladispoli, which would serve as
our home for the next year.
This was hand-delivered and left in my
mailbox by someone who had something important to tell me. I thought.

Edward M. House and President Woodrow Wilson
worked together to establish a world government through a League of Nations.
House would go on to co-found the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921.
House was the author of
Philip Dru - Administrator, a book he wrote anonymously. In the novel Philip Dru, America
becomes ruled by a dictator, who throws out the Constitution and introduces
reform.
Wilson once said,
Mr. House is my second personality. He is
my independent self. His thoughts and mine are one. If I were in his
place I would do just as he suggested... If anyone thinks he is
reflecting my opinion by whatever action he takes, they are welcome to
the conclusion.
Crossover partners
As in a conventional teleplay, there are actually secret spin-off
organizations similar to the Bilderberg Group.
The largest is
the Round
Table, whose branches include Britains Royal Institute of International
Affairs, Institutes of International Affairs of Canada, Australia, South
Africa, India and Holland, as well as Institutes of Pacific Relations for
China, Russia and Japan.
One of the Round Tables branches in the United
States is called the Council on Foreign Relations, or
CFR. Part of the
origins of the CFR go back to 1921 and one of its founders, Edward Mandell
House, who was President Woodrow Wilsons chief advisor and rumored to be
the power behind the Wilson administration from 1913 to 1921.
Ironically, House was a known Marxist. He
idealized socialism, and under his watch in the White House, he lobbied for
a state-controlled central bank empowered to make U.S. money. In 1913, the
United States Congress still controlled the countrys currency, but that
year passage of the Federal Reserve Act transferred Congress power to a
private central bank.
House also proposed the 16th Amendment to the
United States Constitution, which introduced the graduated income tax,
another id ea he borrowed from Karl Marx.28 House also wrote the plan for
the League of Nat ions, which was President Wilsons prized proposal at the
1919 Paris Peace Conference.
Charles Seymour, Houses official biographer,
said that Wilson,
approved the House draft almost in its
entirety, and his own rewriting of it was practically confined to
phraseology.

Richard Salant.
One of the best kept secrets is the degree to
which a handful of giant conglomerates, all belonging to the secret
Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations, NATO, the Club of Rome, and
the Trilateral Commission, control the worlds flow of information.
They determine what we see on television, hear
on the radio and read in newspapers, magazines, books, or on the Internet.
Bilderberg has, at on e time or another, had representatives of all major
U.S. and European newspapers and network news outlets attend meetings. These
media people are invited on the condition that they promise to report
nothing.
This is how the Bilderbergers sustain their news
blackouts throughout the United States and Europe. Doing a cursory check of
the Web pages of the principal international news outlets, we will not find
even one reference to the most important group that counts among its members
all the most important politicians, businessmen and financiers.
Worse, the re was no hint of the beginning of
the Iraq hostilities, even from the press who attended a 2002 Bilderberg

Enforced disarmament
Unknown to almost everyone, the U.S. government, sponsored by the Council on
Foreign Relations, has made a secret commitment to surrender irrevocably to
the United Nations the means of protecting its national sovereignty, and,
ultimately, to confiscate all of the weapons owned by its own citizens, as
part of a planned future global disarmament program.
Except that the future, as far as this
particular program is concerned, appears to be very near indeed. Some
prestigious members of the American political community fully agree with
this policy. CFR fellow Walter Rostow, JFKs adviser in the Viet Nam War,
wrote in his book The United States in the World Arena, that it is a
legitimate American national objective to see removed from all nations -
including the United States - the right to us e substantial military force
to pursue their own interests.
Since this right is the root of national
sovereignty, it is therefore an American interest to see an end to
nationhood as it has been historically defined. As a State Department
official, heading its policy-planning council, Walt Rostow authored the
infamous Rostow Papers, which laid out these goals for American foreign
policy: unilateral disarmament, world government and accommodation with the
Communist world.
Was Walter Whitman Rostow a Communist, an
anti-American or a one-world globalist? His father was a Marxist
revolutionary in Russia. His brother, Eugene Debs Rostow, was named after
prominent labor organizer and Socialist leader Eugene Debs. Two of his aunts
were members of the Communist Party. Walter Rostow, on three separate
occasions was

CFR cabinet control
The National Security Act of 1947 established the office of Secretary of
Defense.
Since 1947 there have been 14 Secretaries of
Defense on the Council on Foreign Relations and/or Trilateral Commission
membership list. One undercover FBI agent once explained it to me this way:
President Clinton has appointed three Secretaries of Defense - William
Cohen, William Perry, and Les Aspin. Under Secretary for International
Security Affairs Lynn Etheridge Davis has been coordinating Psychological
Operations under all three.
Davis has been involved with the U.S.
Intelligence community and a part of every Administration from the 70s
through the 90s. Davis, Clinton and Perry are Trilateral Commission
members. Davis, Clint on, Cohen, and Aspin all belong to the Council on
Foreign Relations.
Davis is al so a Vice President at David
Rockefellers Chase Manhattan Bank. Now, my FBI source continued,
with whom do you suppose Lynn Etheridge
Davis loyalties lie?
Davis once published a book, in 1974, titled,
The Cold War Begins: Soviet-American Conflict Over Eastern Europe. It
contained this chilling sentence:
The most important step would be for
government to place volunteer military forces under UN command.
Is it any wonder that so many honest and
patriotic men and women of the American spy community are helping to fight
the menace of the New World Order?
The CFR and psycho
political operations
According to Department of the Army Pamphlet No. 525-71, The Art and Science
of Psychological Operations,
the Secretary of Defense is the principal
assistant to the president in all matters relating to Department of
Defense, and exercises direction, authority, and control over the
department. He serves as a member of t he National Security Council.
Among the several principal military and civilian advisor and staff
assistants to the secretary, his assistant secretary for Inter national
Security Affairs has major Psychological Operations (PSYOP) related
responsibilities.42
Hadley Cantril, a successful 1940s sociologist
and public opinion researcher explained this in his 1967 book, The Human
Dimension: Experiences in Policy Research, published by Rutgers University
Press:
Psycho-political operations are propaganda
campaigns designed to create perpetual tensions and to manipulate
different groups of people to accept the particular climate of opinion
the CFR seeks to achieve in the world.
As Ken Adachi has noted,
What most Americans believe to be Public
Opinion is in reality carefully crafted and scripted propaganda
designed to elicit a desired behavioral response from the public. 43
Getting people to behave the way you hope they
will behave by persuading them that it is ultimately in their interest to do
so is achieving a desired behavioral response. Public opinion polls are
qualitative studies that investigate in depth the motivations, the feelings,

Europe has been forced into a union of states.
Not as Napoleon dreamed it would b e, under the
French flag, and not as Hitler planned to subjugate it under the Swastika.
But, by a stroke of irony, as both Napoleon and Hitler sought to unify
Europe under the Eagle standard, so does the Eagle emblem represent the
United States, and high-powered Americans have worked in secret and in
public to dismantle independent sovereignties to create todays European
Union.
Ambrose Evans-Pritchard tracks this
American push to European unification in an article in The Telegraph of
London from September of 2000:
The U.S. Intelligence community ran a
campaign in the Fifties and Sixties to build momentum for a united
Europe. It funded and directed the European federalist movement.
During the period mentioned, the CIA was
directed by influential members of the Council on Foreign Relations: Allen
Dulles, General Walter Bedell Smith and William Donovan, the former head of
the OSS, precursor to the CIA.
Donovan led the American Committee for a United
Europe, which ran and supported the European federalist movement, as noted i
n Evans-Pritchards article. The dots leading to the unification of European
nations travel from the Marshall Plan, to the European Coal and Steel
Community, to the European Economic Community, and its not far-reaching to
say that Americas Council on Foreign Relations paved the path for the
present European government.
CFR members have been involved in every step of
the journey.

Confrontation, 2003
circus of maroon and gold colors played in the late evening sky over the
French town of Versailles, yet the night seemed sullen.
Oppressive heat and humidity hung everywhere as
I walked the local streets, looking to quench my thirst. Some three hundred
meters from the famous Trianon Palace Hotel, a horseshoe dangling over the
doorway of a rundown tavern caught my eye. Its worn purple and green
exterior needed a good paint job, and the contrast between the luxurious
hotel and this pubs plainness struck my sense of irony: were we destined to
return to a world with only two classes - rich and poor, rulers and workers
- in a system reminiscent of feudal lords and serfs, and under one
government dominating the world?
It was a plan few cared to know about, and
tonight I was tired of searching f or evidence that would expose this threat
to our freedom. I had arranged no interviews. I just wanted the comfort of
humdrum activity and the din of disconnected voices.
Appetizing smells from within the pub perked my
craving for a café cream, and I crossed the doorstep. Inside, only standing
room was left at the bar. I found a spot, leaned against the counter top and
gave the bartender my order. In front of me, myriad liquor bottles, cups and
glasses lined the wall racks. A coffee machine sat on the counter. Behind me
and to my right, Welsh tourists and a bearded hunchback wearing leather
gloves and a traveling cap occupied a group of tables gathered together.
While I wondered why he was wearing gloves on
such a sultry night, a fat lady with an oversized mole on her chin explained
to the tourists that he was a pianist and had to protect his hands.
Back To The future
Without a doubt, the Bilderberg Group is the premier occult forum operating
in the shadows of power, but a little understood entity - the Trilateral
Commission ( TC) - also plays a vital role in the New World Orders scheme
to use wealth, concentrated in the hands of the few, to exert world control.
The powerful individuals who belong to the
Trilateral Commission all share the same anti-nationalist philosophy, and
try to prevent the national forces within their respective countries from
exerting influence on policy. The Trilateral Commission was established in
1973. Its founder and primary mover was international financier David
Rockefeller, longtime chairman of the Rockefeller family-controlled Chase
Manhattan Bank.
Journalist Bill Moyers spoke about the power of
David Rockefeller in a TV documentary, The Secret Government in 1980:
David Rockefeller is the most conspicuous
representative today of the ruling class, a multinational fraternity of
men who shape the global economy and manage the flow of its capital...
Private citizen David Rockefeller is accorded privileges of a head of
state... He is untouched by customs or passport offices and hardly
pauses for traffic lights.
The first meeting of the Trilateral
Commission was held in Tokyo between October 21 and 23, 1973.
Sixty-five persons represented the North American group. Of those,
35 were also affiliated with the Council on Foreign Relations. The
Trilateral Commission is divided into three regions - American,
European and Pacific Asian. American headquarters are in Washington;

Sophisticated Subversion
How does one explain the subtle interdependence of the industrial
north with the Third World? asks Knight-Ridder columnist, Holly
Sklar, in The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World
Management.
In 1991, an economist, and The Nations
Contributing Editor Doug Henwood posted his answer in the Left Business
Observer, a newsletter he had founded in 1986:
...each member of the Triad has gathered
under itself a handful of poor countries to act as sweatshops,
plantations, and mines: the U.S. has Latin America; the EC, Eastern and
Southern Europe and Africa; and Japan, Southeast Asia. In a few cases,
two Triad members share a country - Taiwan and Singapore are split
between Japan and the U.S.; Argentina, between the U.S. and the EC;
Malaysia, between the EC and Japan; and India is shared by all three.
Rockefellers strategy, writes Will Banyon
also reveals something fundamental about wealth and power: it does not
matter how much money one has; unless it is employed to capture and
control those organizations that produce the ideas and the policies that
guide governments and the people who eventually serve in them, the real
power of a great fortune will never be realized.7 0 Writing in a Letter
to the Editor of the New York Times on August 20, 1980, David
Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, defended the purpose
of the Trilateral Commission in an unprecedented..
Packaging a president
In the spring of 1972, a high profile group of men gathered for dinner with
W. Averell Harriman, the grand old man of the Democratic Party, a
Bilderberger and member of the CFR.
Also present were Milton Katz, a CFR
member and Director of International Studies at Harvard, Robert Bowie, who
would later become Deputy Director of the CIA, George Franklin, David
Rockefellers coordinator for the Trilateral Commission, and Gerald Smith,
U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Non-Proliferation Matters.
The focus of their discussion was the
not-too-distant 1976 U.S. Presidential elections. Harriman suggested that if
the Democrats wanted to recapture t he White House,
we had better get off our high horses and
look at some of those southern governors.
Several names cropped up. Among them were James
Earl Carter, governor of Georgia, Reubin Askew, governor of Florida, and
Terry Sanford, former governor of North Carolina and, at the time, President
of Duke University.
Katz is reported to have promptly informed David
Rockefeller that Carter was a viable candidate and could be sold politically
to the American public. In the fall of 1973, Rockefeller invited Carter for
dinner in London, in order to better acquaint himself with Georgias
governor. As he listened to the southern gentleman, he became convinced that
Carter was ideally suited to become the next U.S. president.
The Times of
London gave an account of the developing Rockefeller-Carter relationship:
Governor Jimmy Carter, 1976 Democratic game
of monopoly
Nowhere, writes Gary Allen in Chapter Nine of The Rockefeller File,
do we find any policy determinations [of the Trilateral Commission] in
favor of individual free enterprise and individual freedoms.
This complete rejection of free enterprise and
individual freedom is puzzling.
How can Marxism, and its resulting system of
social and economic equalization, fascinate David Rockefeller, or the
Trilateral Commission? Rockefeller is not only rich; he is well-educated. He
knows t he failure of Marxism in the form of Communism under ruthless
dictators like Stalin in the twentieth century, in which an estimated 100
million citizens were slaughtered under the Communist regime, over a billion
more enslaved. How do we reconcile the mental image of a Capitalist
embracing a Marxist, or any Communist/Socialist?
The reason for the apparent incongruity is in
our learned definitions of these words. In school, we are taught Capitalism
is based on free enterprise. Capitalists are wealthy entrepreneurs, people
who go into business for themselves to make money, and you cant make money
unless you produce profits. This is the cornerstone of free enterprise.
Worldwide, free enterprise becomes free trade in
a global marketplace. Everyone works to make money, which produces profits
to invest in more businesses and industries that make money to create more
jobs t hat spread wealth and build a higher standard of life for all.
The goods and ser vices produced are the
collaborative result of individual imagination and innovation.
Whatever the mind can conceive, it can
achieve.

Treason for profit
From the 1920s, Morgan-Rockefeller interests played a leading role in
numerous pr o-Soviet commercial arrangements.
They controlled the principal firms doing
business with Soviet Russia: Vacuum Oil, International Harvester, Guaranty
Trust and New York Life. In 1926, the Vacuum Oil Company, owned by
Rockefeller, closed an agreement with the Soviet Naptha Syndicate to market
Soviet oil in European countries through the Chase National Bank (also
Rockefeller-owned).
At the time, it was reported that John D.
Rockefeller agreed on a $75,000,000 loan to the Bolsheviks as part of the
price for the arrangement. As a result of this deal, Rockefellers Standard
Oil built an oil refinery in Russia in 1927, after they were promised 50% of
the Caucasus oil production.
But, as early as 1911, John Moody h ad already
nicknamed the Standard Oil Co. the Standard Oil Bank because, as he
observed, the,
Standard Oil Co. was really a bank of the
most gigantic character - a bank within an industry ... lending vast
sums of money to needy borrowers just as other great banks were
doing.104
Again, the Rockefellers played a key role in
founding the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce in 1922 to promote trade
with Russia under the direction of its chairman, Reeve Schley, who was vice
president of Chase National Bank as well.
As a prerequisite to opening up
the Russian market to the Establishment, in 1925 John D. Rockefeller added
pressure to the...
Sacrificing a nation
While many biographies, including David Rockefellers autobiography,
Memoirs, describe the Rockefellers unlimited economic and political power,
and the familys fabulous wealth, as spent on feeding the starving in Third
World countries, educating the poor through myriad benevolent foundations
and societies, and building the infrastructure of underdeveloped and war
ravaged nations, few have dealt with what many believe to be the most
remarkable aspect of the family - its single -minded intent to destroy the
United States as an independent nation, to establish, for the greater good,
a New World Order. Without a justifiable and a visible enemy, no nation will
voluntarily give up its individual rights and freedoms.
The Bilderberg, CFR and Trilateral brethren know
they have to produce a reason for people to buy into their One World Plan.
Every day their rhetoric grows louder.
The Web site of the Trilateral Commission, for
instance, speaks boldly of s haring leadership responsibilities, and
advocates closer cooperation and mutual understanding.
How they understand these terms, however, varies
greatly fro m how the greater part of the population understands them.
By the time Brzezinski, Cyrus Vance, Defense
Secretary Harold Brown and Undersecretary of the Treasury Anthony Solomon
came together to help found the Trilateral Commission, they we re already
actively participating in a parallel initiative promoted by the CFR called
the 1980s Project:
the largest single effort in CFRs
history.

Detention, 2004
For once, my mind wasnt on the Bilderbergers. Nor was it on the sleepy
resort town of Stresa in Italy, where they planned to meet this year.
Instead, as I made my way through Milans Malpensa International Airport, my
thoughts were busy see king meaning in my past.
Was it a storehouse of remembered images and
concealed patterns that contain the key to the mysterious designs on my
life? What if I never discovered that key? What would become of me?
Buona sera. Would you please come with us,
sir?
The sharp voice penetrated my ponderings. I
looked up. A man, dressed in a raincoat, approached me. The raincoat struck
me as odd.
Through the wall of windows lining the airport
terminal, I could see the Mediterranean blue sky. No cloud in sight. And
then I spotted the shiny automatic weapon slung a cross his shoulders under
his coat. Butterflies fluttered in my stomach.
Feeling s of prearranged tragedy, or more
precisely, the ever-present shadow I lived wit h, reminded me of the
perilous ways in which I chose to make my living. The man in the raincoat
stopped directly in front of me, clicked his heels and tipped hi s index and
middle fingers to his temple in salute. Flashes of Tweedle Dum and Tweedle
Dee sprung to mind from the prior years experience in Versailles.
He introduced himself as a detective.
Would you please come with us? he asked
again.
Flanked by two local guards and a narcotics
officer with a Doberman, the detective and I passed into a detention room
where small-time hoodlums and big-time criminals were usually questioned...

Bilderberg reports
Bilderberg 2005 may 5-8 Rottach-Egern, Bavaria, Germany Hile Bush, Blair,
Chirac, Berlusconi and Company attended the G8 summits of the worlds
foremost democratically elected leaders, they were accompanied by the massed
ranks of the world media. In stark contrast, the comings and goings at
Bilderberg took place under cover of a virtual publicity blackout.
After three straight years of open hostilities
and tension amongst the European, British and American Bilderbergers caused
by the war in Iraq, the aura of complete congeniality amongst them had
returned. Bilderbergers reaffirmed, and remain united in, their long-term
goal to strengthen the role the UN plays in regulating global conflicts and
relations.
Although George W. Bush didnt personally attend
the meeting in Rottach-Egern, the U.S. Government was well represented by
William Luti, Richard Perle, Dennis Ross and Allan Hubbard. However, it is
important to understand that Americans are no more the Hawks than the
European Bilderbergers are the Doves. Europeans joined in supporting the
1991 invasion of Iraq by President Bushs father, celebrating, in the words
of one notable Bilderberg hunter the end of Americas Viet Nam syndrome.
European Bilderbergers...
This conflict, between those who love freedom and those who wish to
subjugate us, is far from over.
Successes have been many, but so have
disappointments. A group of very determined freedom-loving citizens from
across the globe has forced the all-powerful Bilderbergers to take cover, to
become more secretive, more paranoid, and henceforth less invisible.
We have been joined in our fight by men and
women from every Western and some Eastern European secret service agencies.
Little happens in the corridors of power which is not almost immediately
relayed to us through our trusted contacts. We operate within the law,
triple checking our sources, references and leads. This effort is far from
easy.
But when I weaken and grow tired of the
sacrifice this struggle has demanded from me, I think of millions of people
from around the world who have fought and died so that one day, we, the
generations who have come in their wake, can enjoy the privileges of liberty
and the honest and decent pursuit of happiness their sacrifice has afforded
us.
There was a time, when down on my luck, angry
and frustrated because no on e seemed to listen, to understand and to fathom
the dark clouds gathering all around us, I felt betrayed by society and took
it very personally and very hard. I wanted to run away, to be alone, to feel
sorry for myself, and to blame the res t of the world for the misdeeds of a
criminal few.
Then, I grew up. I thought of the families of
the Israelis and Palestinians killed in an ever spiraling violence of hatred
whose lives have forever been destroyed by the unspeakable evil hatred
represents. This hatred is not spontaneous. It has been masterfully impose d
and managed from behind the scenes by the Bilderberger/CFR/TC/Round Table/RIIA
controllers, who are dragging the unwilling world to its utter decimation.
I thought of millions of crack babies born in
inner-city ghettos and tens of million s of opiate addicts whose future has
been turned into drug addiction because a s elect few make a lot of money
from the misfortunes of others.
I thought of the lies and deaths of hundreds of
millions of innocent young soldiers who were sent by the slick propaganda
campaigns to their demise at Verdun and every other engagement of WWI, WWII,
Korea, Viet Nam, the Falklands, Panama, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc., etc., etc.
I thought of Agent Orange and the Gulf War
syndrome responsible for turning strong young, square-shouldered soldiers
into frail old men at the age of 30.
I thought of the hundreds of thousands dyings in
the firebombing of Dresden, unwitting guinea pigs in
the
Tavistock instigated psychological warfare experiments.
And I stand firm and determined with the ever-growing number of people
worldwide who have lost all faith in their governments, who are sick to
their stomachs of the lies and the greed and the duplicity, the pantomime,
the facetiousness and the manipulation, by those who call themselves our
leaders. Three hundred and seventy years ago, Galileo Galilei was
persecuted for teaching that the earth was a round planet that revolved
around the sun.
The Catholic Church and much of t he citizenry
reviled the great man because they were terrified that this truth would
upset the social order. As someone has said,
The problem is peoples inherent
unwillingness to face things of which they are afraid, thereby
scapegoating and sacrificing their fellows to an evil they dare not
confront themselves.
I live for the day and the hour in which men and
women of honor will recognize that dignity, kindness, integrity, trust, love
of thy fellow beings are as indispensable to the survival of the human race
as Galileos discoveries were.
These principles of humanity should be enshrined
on some document somewhere, so that should a future despot decide to betray
Humanity once again, he will pay dearly for it.
On the surface, this book is about a secretive
Group known simply as the Bilderbergers. On a much deeper level, however, it
is about inner faith and conviction, which public opinion, bribery, lust for
money and power cannot influence. This book is about the integrity and honor
of many individuals. It is about helping people learn to think, and stand
independent in their thoughts even from the so-called experts, masterfully
represented by every major media group who would t ell them which conspiracy
theory not to believe.
This book is also about my life , about my
refusing to live in fear. Until my dying breath, I shall live as a free man,
walking the earth as a free man does, with my head held high.
Only when we decide to let fear govern our
actions will those whom we oppose and despise truly won.
