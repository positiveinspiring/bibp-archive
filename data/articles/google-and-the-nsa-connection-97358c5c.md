# Google and The NSA Connection

The data mining technology that is integral to the
Google AdWords
experience is a power tool in creating an individual profile for anyone
who surfs the web.
The amazing capacity to target specific ads to personal search topics,
geographic locations and web history is the harbinger of a total recall
on your personality. If the benefits of getting relevant advertisement
that maximize sales opportunities were the only purpose of the process,
the relatively benign intrusion of a materialistic message might be
tolerable to most internet users.
However, the bull in the china shop is not merely in the business of
making a commercial profit. Google is a wonder creation of the calculate
surveillance society.
Research at Google
acknowledges:
"When data mining systems are placed at the core
of interactive services in a rapidly changing and sometimes
adversarial environment, statistical models need to be combined with
ideas from control and game theory; for example, when using learning
in auction algorithms.
Research at Google is at the forefront of
innovation in machine learning and data mining - we have one of the
most active groups working on virtually all aspects of data mining."
OK, so the dominant internet technology company is in
business to harvest information on the inner recesses of each unique
login. Should a cyber sleuth be concerned?
Well, according to the scholarly paper,
The Google-NSA
Alliance - Developing Cybersecurity Policy at Internet Speed
by Stephanie A. DeVos:
"On February 4, 2010, the Washington Post
reported that Google and the National Security Agency had partnered
to analyze the cyberattacks, with the objective of better defending
Google and its users from future attack.
Though neither organization commented on the
partnership, sources told the Washington Post that the alliance
allows for the sharing of critical information without violating
Googles policies or laws that protect Americans privacy of online
communications.
Under the terms of the alliance, Google will not
be sharing proprietary data and the NSA will not be viewing users
searches or e-mail accounts.
The article stated that Google approached the NSA
shortly after the attacks, but due to the sensitivity of the
alliance, the deal took time to be formulated.
Any agreement would be the first instance where
Google had entered a "formal information-sharing relationship" with
the NSA."
PC World in the article,
The Google-NSA
Alliance - Questions and Answers
lists the following concerns and would have you believe there is nothing
ominous behind any alleged relationship.
-
Is the Google-NSA alliance really happening?
-
What would be the point of a Google-NSA
partnership?
-
Would the government gain access to my
personal information?
-
Why would Google work with the NSA instead of
the Department of Homeland Security?
-
Has the NSA worked with Google before?
If the nature of the relationship between Google and
the
National
Security Agency is innocent,
where is the transparency?
This item from Legal Times,
DOJ Asks Court
To Keep Secret Any Partnership Between Google, NSA,
has a disturbing appearance.
"The Justice Department is defending the
government's refusal to discuss - or even acknowledge the existence
of - any cooperative research and development agreement between
Google and the National Security Agency.
The Washington based advocacy group Electronic
Privacy Information Center sued in federal district court here to
obtain documents about any such agreement between the Internet
search giant and the security agency.
The NSA responded to the suit with a so-called
"Glomar" response in which the agency said it could neither confirm
nor deny whether any responsive records exist. U.S. District Judge
Richard Leon in Washington sided with the government last July."
Another concern comes from a report in
Higher
Thinking Primate.
"The ruling comes as controversy has been growing
around CISPA, a bill that passed the House last month that would
allow private firms like Google to share a wide range of information
with government agencies like the NSA for cybersecurity reasons."
Even if one accepts that, the NSA agreement preserves
Google's stated policies on Americans' privacy, what will be the effect
of the new CISPA legislation on the supposed firewall protecting your
personal data history?
The technology behind the most successful search
engine evolves as different objectives develop. Anyone conducting Google
searches knows that changes to their algorithms have the net effect of
filtering out results that once were routine.
The
Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) has
concerns about,
"the vagueness of what Google considers to be a
high number of removal notices, how Google plans to make its
determinations, and how, "there will be no process of recourse for
sites who have been demoted."
Many civil libertarians fear that the sordid
political agenda of the NSA is influencing the business practices of
Google to ban "undesirable" content from search queries.
Wire publishes a disturbing article,
NSA Mimics
Google, Pisses Off Senate.
"In 2008, a team of software coders inside the
National Security Agency started reverse-engineering the database
that ran Google.
They closely followed the Google research paper
describing BigTable - the sweeping database that underpinned many of
Googles online services, running across tens of thousands of
computer servers - but they also went a little further. In
rebuilding this massive database, they beefed up the security.
After all, this was the NSA."
Even more sinister is the description of NSA projects
on
How The NSA
Used Google To Spy On Americans - Until The Internet Figured It Out.
The 634-page book, "Untangling The Web - A Guide to Internet Research", which is
available for
download and was published by
the NSAs Center for Digital Content, has an interesting chapter
entitled "Google Hacking."
