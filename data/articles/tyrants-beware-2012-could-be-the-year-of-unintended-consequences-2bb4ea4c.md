Then
year 2012 could be the year of liberty
rising pushing back against tyranny.
When we have people conspiring behind closed
doors against our liberty and way of life. What goes around comes around
like a boomerang. The very plot they seek to destroy humanity can be the
weapon that take them down.
The internet has proclaimed on the roof tops
what was spoken in secrecy in darkness.
We have seen what happened to,
-
Russia
-
China
-
Germany
-
Cuba,
...when they implement a dark tyranny.
America has been
blessed with seeing all this happen a safety from a distance. Now these same
forces are trying to take down America the same way.
We can see the globalist trying to bring down America losing the wiggle
room.
They cannot go to war because they have shown
their cause to be farce. I have a feeling even their minion politicians
brought and paid for might be having second thoughts about carrying out the
agenda of the bankers who want to implode the nations.
They may see these bankers are insane that could
bring their own destruction if they follow along knowing this can have far
reaching consequences they maybe the end of them too. If you ever seen the
movie True Lies when the agent tried jumping building to building with a
horse. The horse will only go so far going up the stairs.
At a certain point even the horse will say hell
no in the name of self preservation then follow the master orders to jump
off the building.
With the Congress passing
NDAA (S-1867) and the rest of the factions inside
the US government in the highest levels moving to quash what is left of our
liberties might start to see the unintended consequences of their actions.
They are not dealing with Europeans and Asians. They are dealing with
Americans.
The weeks before Christmas we seen fire arms
sales surge to a record level.
The reason why because a coming collapse and
they do not trust the government. We have seen what the governments solution
to every problem they created. Instead of allowing the people to deal with
it because they are more capable to have a better solution. The governments
solution is loss of freedom and a jackbooted thug in a black uniform with an
MP-5.
The real war may not start out on the streets of America. It might be inside
our own government from the bureaucracy to the Pentagon because the good
people inside these agencies might resist from inside the system. We can see
county sheriffs with thousands of armed posse ready to throw out the feds.
We can see police when the tyranny starts to hit
the fan resist inside their own departments. We can see corrupt police
chiefs and local politicians being arrested doing the bidding for the
Homeland security. This is the year anything could happen because the
enemies of liberty have so much more to lose if defeated.
With
Ron Paul rising in the polls because people recognize his genuine
character.
This can be the year where the straw breaks the
camel's back. If the Ron Paul is harmed by an attempt to take his life. If
election fraud is exposed out in the open with public outrage. If the
internet is interfered in anyway to silence the opposition. If fee speech is
criminalized. If people's money is bank accounts are stolen to shore up
failing banks.
If safety deposit boxes are raided to steal the
silver and gold from the people to fund a crumbling empire. If people start
being arrested and disappear not knowing their whereabouts. If being poor
becomes a crime by no fault of their own.
The corrupt system being so arrogant might be
biting off more then they can chew.
The year 2012 might be the year of unintended consequences the tyrants did
not expect. The tyrants study human nature from a scientific vantage point
thinking this is how they can control the people. They underestimate the
human spirit. They are human just like us and no more superior then the
average person.
The difference is Joe six pack lives in the real
world and the ruling class lives the life of delusion.
This could be the year no matter what they throw
at the American people, that momentum like the art of jujitsu can come back
on them. We can see a peaceful insurrection where the military will not
attack Iran and arrest Americans.
There can be real serious blow back they never
expected to happen because they live a life of illusion.
We can see the people in complete defiance. When we have a group that is out
of touch with the people, when the citizens have been pushed around long
enough. Expect unintended consequences to follow because like the law of
reciprocity. When there is an action, there will be a reaction that even the
most power mad tyrants will not be able to quash.
Their is biggest folly is not expecting the
unexpected because of unintended consequences will follow. 2012 can be the
year of unintended consequences where liberty rises and tyranny falls apart.
I am hopeful of 2012. Are you?
