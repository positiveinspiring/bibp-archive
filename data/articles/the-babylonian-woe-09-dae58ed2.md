POTSHERDS AND OTHER FRAGMENTS
The glimpse at these cataclysmic events of relatively modern times, as in
the previous chapter, will assist towards understanding of the implications
of similar events in ancient times of which but the most fragmentary
information exists.
As was written three thousand years ago:
"Is there anything whereof it may be said; See this is new ? it hath been
already of old time which was before us." (1)
So returning to that smaller world of ancient days, the theme of this book,
it may safely be said that similar conspiracy and secret manoeuvre led up to
all that fast changing sequence of social events that clearly followed a
definite design, in Attica; particularly from the collapse of hereditary
kingship in 683 B.C.; which date marks, it most reasonably may be assumed,
the commencement of rule by Money Creative Power either international or
home grown...
A king created annually by vote has even less chance of ruling
effectively than the so-called presidents of today, elective kings as they
really are, though sorry enough spectacles some of them may be, and who have
as much as five years to serve the purposes of whoever they front for...
Some writers dismiss the idea of a capitalism in antiquity, but accepting
definition of capitalism as the condition of the unrestricted promotion of
human activity through the instrument of the driving force of that power of
creation, and loan against collateral, and at interest, of the unit of
exchange, or of promises of the unit of exchange as denoted by Ledger Credit
Page Entry, and which function as the same thing in exchanges between
persons dealing with the same banker or interlocked system of banks, very
little analysis of the circumstances that gave rise to the tyrants will show
that a form of "capitalism" did exist, even if more local in character, and
restricted to the individual city, or state, as a rule.
The tyrant was front
man towards the total monetization of the state, the land and its labour,
and towards the transfer of that independent labour formerly firmly placed
in the Natural Order of God-Life, to a condition of dependence on a wage of
money, directed towards being able to keep on living as with the notion of
being a free man.
Today we but repeat the mistakes of the past; however today it is not merely
disaster to a small city or state and its way of life, but with the existing
refinement of that which can only be described as the money swindle as it
was conducted in ancient times by the trapezitae at their bench in the
market place, made possible by mass paper manufacture and the printing
press, and the enormous potentialities therein towards quickening the speed
and drive of human life and endeavor, it almost certainly will prove to be,
one way or another, total disaster, and to all mankind...
Those lines of Solon say enough:
But of themselves in their folly the men of the city are willing Our great
city to wreck, being won over by wealth. False are the hearts of the
people's leaders. (2)
A further couplet indicates the meaning of "our great city to wreck".
Great men ruin a city: for lack of understanding Under a despot's yoke lieth
the people enslaved. (3)
These lines written after the seizure by Peisistratus of the Tyranny at
Athens would indicate that the same Peisistratus had the assistance in his
rise to power of those former great landowning families of Attica who had
been drawn into the schemes of the foreign money masters to their undoing...
These landowners had forgotten their duty towards their own people.
Fascinated by strange luxuries and the stranger talk of the money men, the trapezitae, they had permitted themselves to be absorbed with visions of
that new wealth measured by the numbers indicated by the precious metal
symbols of these same trapezitae...
They forgot that in the absolute
analysis they themselves were but stewards of a higher power. Lacking
understanding, above all, of the true nature of this money as being above
all their own law towards the facilitation of the exchanges amongst
themselves and their people, they had been lead astray from their duty.
By
conniving with the bankers and their protégées the new manufacturers, to
drive their own people off the land into the cities, and into the industries
rapidly speeding up from the new money economy, they forgot that in their
capacity as rulers, the whole land was theirs in trust to their people, and
that the people therefore were expectant of them to be their guides and
shepherds.
These plausible aliens who set up the money economy via their so-called
"banks", owned nothing but unmitigated gall, a vast contempt for mankind,
and such as they could double-talk the naïve peasant rulers into giving
them.
The folly of these rulers in equating possession with the master moneyers
trifling pieces of gold and silver dated back to those grim Kings of the
Homeric Sagas or before, who, being lain in their graves at Mycenae with all
their riches, thus set off on their eternal journey with that small store of
gold that the crafty Babylonian money-men had trained them to regard as
wealth, as opposed to the real wealth of an organized state whose money was
the benevolent law of the ruler in relation to surpluses, and directed
towards the good and continuing life of the people and no more...
Those who had power and made men to marvel at their riches. (4)
This line indicates that Solon, like so many equally worthy people of this
day, knew that money was an evil without understanding what it was about
money that made it so... Not the having of the precious metal pieces of the
banker recording the number of units represented, for such metal money lying
inert beneath the floors (5) has no meaning so far as the quickening or
slowing of the pulse of life is concerned...
It has no more meaning than
have abstract units of exchange media that have not yet been recorded in the
ledger on account of no suitable (to the banker!) demand for them... and, of
course, they are without limit... Nor even the spending of it as the holder,
according to law, might choose... The evil is in the forgetfulness of the
ruler that money is no more than a recording of his law of exchange, its
magnitude being governed by the number of units indicated... It can never be
treasure which is merely items carrying with them a high valuation in
relation to such units, relative to their desirability and portability...
The evil about money derives in consequence from lack of understanding of
its true nature, and particularly from the confusing of money and treasure.
It is the persistent failure of mankind to realize that money is but the
result of agreement being arrived at amongst a sovereign people through
their ruler, to provide themselves with a system of numbers by which their
exchanges might be facilitated, and so help them to live a better life...
Treasure being but commodity by which the unit of value of whatever state
may be, can best be stored; even though such state cease to exist; because
of that ancient and international convention in respect to the valuation of
such treasure such as has lasted from age to age; from the most ancient
times, Palaeolithic or earlier, until today...
The evil lay and it may be said, lies, in the forgetfulness of the ruler to
respect his duty to provide an adequate money supply for his people
regulated by himself and free of obligation to external forces, in such
manner as had existed in the Ancient Oriental civilizations in earlier
times... It lay in the permitting to private and hence irresponsible persons
the power to intervene in that which was the most sacred responsibility of
the ruler through the priesthood, the creation and regulation of the medium
of exchange: his people's money.
Therefore the hidden force behind the setting up of a tyranny was the far
reaching power of a conspiratorial secret society, international in scope,
controlling money emission in all countries which it penetrated through its
continuing control of the sources of supply of that silver treasure by
weight such as constituted the base of the exchange systems long ago
established by itself.
The tyrant, therefore, was clearly the front man for the local banker more
than actually being the banker himself... He it was who gave legality to the
banker and the activities of that coterie of merchants, traders, and
captains who flourished on the banker's financial organization, and, though
this they did not understand, his connection with those international
bullion brokers of the day.
These worthy businessmen depended for tiding
themselves over difficult periods on that which the banker loaned them as
money: maybe an entry in a ledger transferable to the account of a fellow
merchant, visiting captain, or trader in slaves, or other merchandise; they
also depended on the banker to be safe custodian for such treasure as came
their way...
The tyrant was therefore, either naïve or corrupt, the
instrument set up by the banker, firstly towards the legalization of his
status, and secondly towards the removal of that class who might yet
challenge his peculiar and secret power, the natural aristocracy of Hellas.
This natural aristocracy, in a growing system that clearly sought the
alienation and subversion of its free dependents with the purpose of
ultimately leading them into paid day labour or into slavery final and
absolute, was uncertainly situated in states which now owed their existence
to the bankers, and their coterie of entrepreneurs, and manufacturers, and
merchants, as clearly did so many of the Greek states of the Greek
industrial revolution.
The banker, lurking in the shade apart from men, knew that these proud
noblemen, formerly lords of this lovely land which was Greece, had forgotten
the meaning of their own existence, and its relation to the total ordering
of their society, and he despised them as well he might, for permitting him
to undermine the true order of life and cause these simple folk, their
peasantry, to be driven off the land one way or another, to the wage slavery
of the potteries at Corinth, or Athens, or wherever it might be or whatever
it might be.
In the same way, the Lords of the Manors of England and Scotland had driven
the peasantry off the common lands some 2400 years later; land now
representing that magic of money of which previously they had seen little...
The same peasantry drifting into the new manufacturing and mining towns,
dazed and leaderless, then formed a plentiful labour supply for that similar
putrescent wickedness which was the industrial revolution in England's green
and pleasant land. If they were lucky they were able to emigrate.
In the lines of Theognis whose political aim was to prevent a recurrence of
the Tyranny in Megara which was a centre for the manufacture of textiles:
Tradesmen reign supreme : the bad lord it over their betters. This is the
lesson that all must thoroughly master: How that in the world wealth has the
might and the power. Many a bad man is rich and many a good man is needy.
Not without cause, Oh Wealth, do men honor thee above all things. Must men
reckon the only virtue the making of money ? Everyone honours those that are
rich and despises the needy. (6)
The banker, trained from the money shops of Babylonia, knew that for him the
only desirable political situation was where the lowly and vulgar (7) held
the appearance of power and wealth and "money", for such would not question
too intently the source from whence they derived that "money", nor the
nature of that "money" such as had paved their way to so-called power, for
fear its so necessary supply might be cut off. In the words of Aristophanes:
Often has it crossed my fancy that the cities apt to deal With the very best
and noblest of the Commonweal Just as with our ancient coinage, and the fine
new minted gold These, sir, our sterling pieces, all of pure Athenian mould,
All of perfect die and metal, all the fairest of the fair, All of
workmanship unequalled, proved and valued everywhere, These we use not.
But
the worthless pinchbeck coins of yesterday, Vilest die and basest metal, now
we always use instead. Even so our sterling townsmen, nobly born and nobly
bred, Men of worth and rank and mettle, men of honourable fame, Trained in
every liberal science, choral dance and manly game, These we treat with
scorn and insult.
But the strangers newliest come, Worthless sons of
worthless fathers, pinchbeck townsmen, coppery scum (Whom in earlier days
the city hardly would have stooped to use Even for her scapegoat victims)
these for every task we choose. (8)
Where, as in a city such as Megara, one banking house might control all
credit or money creation, to question and seek to know how this was done
would also mean search for knowledge of the banker's secrets and this, our
tyrant instinctively knew, was dangerous for his continued success.
What are the gains that lead up to a tyranny? Is it not more probable that
they are some form of payment received by the commons (those that are bad)
from the would-be tyrant ?
Not at all... Merely the word was passed by that banking institution to
which the majority of tradesmen or manufacturers in that particular city
were indebted, that the banker, giver of all, (and taker of all!), favored
this move.
Ah!... and indeed it would be good for all, and to please the
common people there would be plenty of work! ... It may safely be considered
that the first legislation passed by our new tyrant would legalize the
position of his backers, which previously, as likely as not, had been
illegal!
The tyrant at this stage of history, was a necessity to Money Power, and
while possibly having the appearance of being wealthy, he depended for his
real finances on that backer whose interests he promoted.
Those two officers
of Alexander for example, who accepted the tyranny of Asiatic cities could
in no way have understood the reality of finance, international or
otherwise, except perhaps if they had been clerks in the paymaster corps of
officer status. If they had so understood such finance, it is doubtful that
they would have been promoted as they were...
The tyrant was one who the banker could rely on to put through his
"Leveling" program, or in the double talk of today, could be relied on to
"Press ahead with Democratization", and to work against the class from which
he was supposed to have come. (9)
He was one who could be relied on to put
through programs of public works, maintain military expenditures etc.; for
all such activities strengthened the banker's position as creator and
regulator of the exchange unit, and therefore, from those exclusive
courtyards wherein he schemed, designer of the life of the city.
The banker
could not maintain his hold over the city, except his product, ledger credit
page entry money, however created, was in constant demand, and the local
government deeply embroiled in his schemes. The tyrant had to be one
completely in accord with that so-called "democratic" political attitude,
which the banker always seemed to espouse ...
His ostensible purpose had to
be to "Level"; such leveling meaning of course, tearing down everything
above themselves, (and above the banker too! ...)
Those fragments of verse as quoted here, reputed to be by Solon, leave
little doubt of the sincerity of Solon, at least superficially. The fact
remains that as a merchant, whether of necessity or otherwise, he must have
been marked with some of the outlook of that class.
His famous laws, amongst
which was that law releasing the peasantry from the debt slavery into which
their natural rulers had permitted them to be drawn, and that was eating
into the very vitals of Attica, in view of the fact that he offered
citizenship to any family moving to Athens with the intention of taking up
some manual trade, might very well have been promoted by his backers.
The
city was clearly very short of suitable free labour.
It very well might be
that his backers were those money lenders and bankers that controlled the
growing manufacturies of Athens, and who saw that there was more profit and
work for that which they loaned as money, in bringing the peasantry to
Athens as free men (if a wage slave is really any more free than a slave
owned outright!) (10) and in having thus a plentiful supply of labour, than
in tying such peasantry to the soil by debt slavery, and in the case of
distraint, their sale on to a surfeited market abroad.
While there was still
a healthy population of small holders as well as the great landlords, there
was always possibility of recovery by the enslaved state, and themselves,
the enslavers, as happened at Sparta in the time of Lycurgus, driven out of
the land for hundreds of years...
With a massive proletariat beholden to the
men of the city for their freedom (as day labourers!), the former
aristocracy even if they should ever awaken to their duty, would have no
chance... Nor did they.
All those "liberalizing" laws promulgated by Solon
and his successors, steadily deprived the ancient families of Attica of
their former power and prerogative. The shadow of power was put into the
hands of ignoble persons, as indeed would have been so many of the
"Demagogues", and other "Democratic" officials, who, too often would have
been no more than blind creatures lifted up from the mob to the service of
money power...
By the devices existing as part of what is known as
"democracy", such as Ostrakism through rumor put into circulation by the
secret societies in the city, controlled, as in today, by the bankers
without a doubt, "Leaders" no longer "suitable" could be removed.
"The tyrants themselves are repeatedly found making it part of their policy
to keep their subjects employed on big industrial concerns. In more than one
case we shall see their power collapsing just when this policy becomes
financially impossible." (11)
In other words if that tyrant proved unsatisfactory to his masters, money
that source of strength in political life, was cut off just at the time it
would be most needed, such as when he had become involved in heavy spending.
Herein is further proof of the tyrant being not money power itself, but
front man for money power...
"...This part of the tyrant's policy is noticed by Aristotle who quotes the
dedications (buildings and works of art) of the Cypselids at Corinth, the
buildings of Olymphian Zeus at Athens by the Peisistratids, and the works of
Polycrates around Samos. To these names we add Theagenes of Megara, Phalaris
of Agrigentum, Aristodemus of Cumae and the Tarquins of Rome, all of whom
are associated with works of this kind." (12)
It is pointed out by Professor Ure that it can scarcely be an accident that
the Tyranny of Athens ended almost immediately after the removal of one of
its two roots; the mines of the country of the Thracians and Paionians
(13)
...
Which is to say that if the source of bullion on which the money power
of a so-called banker was founded, petered out, or was lost to enemy action,
the tyrant he had promoted could be discarded as having no further purpose.
Such activities being ordered by a class of persons who had achieved
despotic power in the same period of history, roughly the eighth, seventh,
and sixth centuries B.C., the period which saw extensive development of
mining in all of Europe including Lydia, Cyprus, Spain, (14) Carpathia,
Epirus, Illyria, Thrace and Greece itself, without mentioning the flow of
precious metal plunder deriving from the depredations of the Assyrian, can
only have been the result of a policy deep laid, and far reaching in its
consequences.
This policy can only have been created in some central point
from which flowed the springs of world power such as would have designed,
wittingly, or unwittingly, so much of the ancient world.
The same period also coincided with the development of mining tools of
hardened iron, highly efficient methods of reduction of silver bearing ores,
(15) and the growth of an adequate supply of slave labour from various
sources and due to the above mentioned depredations of the Assyrian etc.;
all of which was so necessary towards profitable mining operations at that
time. It may not unreasonably be supposed that this central point was still
in the cities of lower Mesopotamia, such as Babylon, Ur, Lagash, Uruk etc.
From this area the merchant houses would have continued to have spread their
operations around the world (16) in the same way, as, it is recorded, had
been done from Ur as much as fifteen hundred years before during the
so-called IIIrd Dynasty; (17) or for that matter during the period of
seeming glory and empire that so often follows the accession to power of
private money creative force in any organized and potentially vigorous
state.
A most outstanding instance of the latter in modern times exists in
the period of empire that came to Britain following the establishment of the
Bank of England in 1694 A.D. (18)
The silver which the international bankers drew from Greece etc. at a ratio
of 10:1 or more, would have been used in settlement of trade balances with
India, Bactria, or China, at a ratio of 6:1 or less, as to gold. According
to Alexander del Mar, this movement of silver to the Orient from Athens, was
arranged by the Athenian Government; (19) but except this early Athenian
Government was fronting for the bankers, this could not have been so.
International trade balances have always been settled from the world's
banking capital or headquarters of the international bankers or bullion
brokers, such as was London during the last three centuries until very
recently. In the days of which we write, this world banking capital was
still located in Babylon city, it may reasonably be assumed.
The money of the cities of lower Mesopotamia and the whole Near East for
that matter, had been based for a long time on the international valuation
of silver by weight, and therefore these cities had long ago sought to
obtain control of all sources of supply of such silver.
As far back as 2470
B.C., King Manishtusu of Akkad invaded Southern Persia with no purpose other
than gaining control of its silver mines. (20)
When the rapid expansion of
mining, as mentioned above, brought on to the markets of the world a
relative deluge of silver and gold, the latter taking no mean second place,
those groups controlling International finance from Babylonia, and possibly
from Nineveh, decided no doubt to seek for further worlds to conquer, as it
were.
The thing was to find a use for their surfeit of bullion, particularly
silver, and of which metal they were now in a position to arrange extensive
supplies to any banker who would be able to use such advantageously towards
the promotion of their general worldwide plans. The growing commercial and
industrial vigour of the Greeks showed them an answer to this problem...
Thus the significance of the advent of the tyrants as promoters of heavy
public spending of moneys based originally, on the silver standards of
Babylonia, cannot be dismissed...
The policy of the bankers, for whom the tyrants fronted, would be to spread
the main practice, at least their most profitable one, of private money
creation, one way or the other. Using silver as base, they knew full well
the tremendous possibilities that existed towards the creation of an
abstract money whose equally efficient units cost them no more than entry by
the slave scribe on the clay tablet that sufficed as his ledger.
Such policy
spread, together with competition in manufacture, the need for that which
the international bankers of that day, faceless as in this day, loaned
against collateral as money.
This money was based on the silver bullion they
let it be known they were possessed of or held on deposit for their
customers, be they individual, corporate body, or state.
It is reasonable to assume that there was little difference as between that
first tangible money of private issuance in England as denoted by the
goldsmiths receipts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (21) and the
money as issued by the banks of the Greek cities. Its efficacy in the
exchanges, although it was in reality no more than a highly organized system
of counterfeit, derived from the total secrecy maintained by those involved
in its issue.
Little clear information exists on this subject today as in
ancient times and much of which, even if all the millions of tablets
unearthed in Mesopotamia are ever translated and evaluated by scholars
competent to do so, must remain as but faint outline...
One such faint outline of particular interest, though not deriving from the
Mesopotamian tablets, is discernible in this information of Servius Tullius,
slave king of early Rome:
"According to Charisius, Varro wrote: Nummum argenteum flatum primum a
Servio Tullio dicunt, is IIII scripulis major fuit quam nunc." "It is said
that silver money was first made by Servius Tullius and was IIII scripulis
heavier than now." (22)
As it was Servius Tullius who ordered the establishment of the census at
Rome that gave the basis for both taxation and military service, both
essential organizations as to a state being taken over by international
money power, the truth of this statement by Varro need not be questioned.
It is interesting to note in passing that although Servius Tullius was a
usurper undoubtedly of slave origin, Livy carefully draws him in rather more
favourable light than the Tarquins, particularly Superbus, the last of the
line...
By the time of Livy (59 B.C.-17 A.D.) the most powerful sector of
the Roman population, the equites or knights, was taken over by wealthy
freedmen and enfranchised foreigners (23) ... Livy, when writing in that day
under the threat of Lex Majestus (24) would clearly have seen the value of
finding and extolling true virtue in the character of the slave king,
whether such virtue was there or not...
...However, if Servius actually did exist, and there seems to be a school of
thought amongst the scholars that questions his existence, then it would be
more likely as one who had raised himself up in a similar manner to Gyges of
Lydia, (25) having at the same time a special backing by local money power;
possibly in opposition to that money power emigrant from Corinth to
Tarquinii in Etruria, which, according to Livy, was the Tarquin family.
The establishment of a silver standard as a base for monetary issuance might
very well have been their reward for their assistance towards raising
Servius to the throne.
The Census, supposedly established by Servius, while
being the foundation of the organization of the whole state for defense or
aggression, would give that money power a complete picture of the people it
was their intention, one way or another, to exploit.
In the same manner the
doomsday books of the Middle Ages, while recording for the reference of the
king, all that in the kingdom was, also made valuable record for the money
creative power, which had kings, nobles, ecclesiastics, and the common
people, groaning under a burden of debt quite impossible to meet (which
certainly was one of the main causes of the mood of the English that gave
rise to Magna Carta, and of those events which followed until 1290 A.D. when
the tax-collecting and money-lending classes, such as had followed the
"Conqueror" across the English Channel, were finally evicted).
(26)
In a similar manner some 2500 years later, William III of England, owing his
throne to the intrigues of the international bullion brokers at Amsterdam,
granted them as reward that which they wanted more than anything on earth,
which was the establishment of the legality of an undeterminable amount of
abstract money, ledger credit page entry, or paper notes, to be based on
their gold loans to the state, and the creation of a "Bank" at London from
which they might issue this money known as "Credit" as loan against real
collateral throughout the whole kingdom.
This bank was to be given the
appearance of a state department. In this case such status was obtained by
permitting it to be named: "The Bank of England." (27)
Considering the above known instance of reward to international money powers
for their services, far reaching in its consequences, and many other
instances of which there is neither time nor place to write herewith,
conjecture in respect to the establishment of a silver standard at Rome by
Servius, may not be too far afield.
That Romans later rejected this standard
as a base for their money, and the calamity and loss of sovereignty it
brought them also is clear, for there is no further reference to silver
money until that period when Rome was drifting towards the all-out struggle
with Carthage: the year of the establishment of the board of Moneyers for
the striking of bronze, silver and gold money (289 B.C.): tresviri aere
argento auro flando feriurado; (28) thereby no doubt yielding to the
importunities of the International Bullion brokers, with the ensuing
outbreak of war thus being made a certainty.
One of the main purposes of those extensive public works which almost
invariably followed the establishment of a tyranny, would be towards the
establishment of some kind of National Debt, in which is, and was in that
day too, most control and profit to those manipulating international
finance. That there is no evidence of the existence of such state
indebtedness in those days does not necessarily mean that such did not
exist.
Excavation, or other methods, 2500 years from now would not reveal
this indebtedness for instance in the case of England, so far as its
relation to the Bank of England was concerned, for, unbelievable though it
may seem, there is "remarkable absence of official records" for the first
hundred years of the bank's existence! (29)
In the time of the tyrants,
failure to keep books or records would be even more of a certainty.
Valuable by-products of their extensive public works programs would be:
-
The peasants would leave the land enticed by the money wages offered for
work on these projects, and the pleasures and excitement that could be
bought in the city with such money wages. There, once the construction boom
was over, they formed a leaderless, hungry, and easily embittered
"Proletariat".
-
The same "Proletariat" could be manipulated by the agents of Money Power
as a mob, towards such political purposes as such Money Power might desire;
including, besides removal of the natural nobility, removal of the so-called
tyrant when his purpose was served.
Professor Ure, author of The Origins of Tyranny, ventures as close to the
truth in respect to the meaning of a tyranny as any others who have written
on the subject...
Although attributing the rise of the tyrants to Money
Power he does not define what this Money Power may be; whether money
creative power, or just those of considerable possession and treasure. In
this omission he cannot be blamed.... Professor Ure for instance traces the
source of the power of Peisistratus, Tyrant of Athens 561-527 B.C. according
to Herodotus, (30) as being partly from those silver mines in the district
in Thrace through which flows the Strymon river, and partly from the Laurion
mines in Attica.
However, it must be pointed out that a man who apparently was a mining man
and lived therefore within that restriction, would be unlikely to understand
the finer shades of monetary emission. It seems quite reasonable to suppose
that the class of persons hidden within the Aramaic speaking middle classes
that permeated the whole Levant and Near East during the first Millennium
B.C., and whose business was money and all that stemmed therefrom, in that
they were interfering with that which clearly was a power to be exercised
only by the very gods themselves, were scarcely likely to instruct their
instrument, Peisistratus, therein...
Therefore, it may be concluded, the
tyrant rose because he was the one who had found favor with the
all-pervading money power of the day. He was not money power itself !
In that most of the great public works of the Greek cities had been carried
forward by the tyrants is the evidence; for as the secretive money power of
today, world-wide in scope, thrives primarily upon government loans directed
to purposes of war and the enormous spending that wars involve in order to
strengthen their outrageous claims against the nations, in ancient days
similar heavy spending had to be devised.
In that day, as previously pointed
out, a great Acropolis or some other such magnificent public work with whose
construction and financial organization Money Power was fully conversant,
sufficed equally well with war; which, all said and done, with hardy
aggressive peoples could also prove considerable danger to themselves, or
their purposes.
So, with the tyrant, we see the force by which Greece, previously living in
natural order, was molded to an instrument more suitable to those bankers:
private money creative power, who, lurking in the shade as needs they had
to, burned with rancor at the natural rulers who but treated them as
stewards, although the essence of power for all that, lay in their hands for
more than such rulers understood...
Thus were the simple and industrious and brave Greeks now raised up to be
the new vehicle through which the final and destructive purposes of those
controlling international bullion and slave trades would be achieved, as
they shepherd the peoples of the world further down that road of no hope for
themselves or the rest of mankind...

wars in so called "democratic" states, and with Athens completely dependent
on privately created money for its finances, that is, on the International
Bankers, and with such types of persons suitable to them and their plans for
the future, occupying key positions. The victor, Sparta, was equally
dependent on their good will, as a result of those concessions undoubtedly
made at the Treaty of Miletus, 412 B.C. in order to obtain money such as was
desirable internationally, and with which could be purchased the ships so
necessary to defeat Athens, and without which the war could not have been
brought to definite conclusion.

1917-1922 was supposed to be drawn from the Nobility, or as Mao-Tse-Tung, at
a later date dictator in China, was supposed to have derived from a similar
class in China.
10. The following letter circularized amongst American Bankers by European
Banking interests during the American civil war gives a most revealing light
on this subject. There is no reason to suppose that the motives of the
trapezitae of the Greek city states were in any way more altruistic: "
Slavery is likely to be abolished by the war power and chattel slavery
destroyed. This, I and my European friends are in favour of, for slavery is
but the owning of labour and carries with it the care of the labourers,
while the European plan, led by England, is that capital shall control
labour by controlling wages..." This letter, known as the Hazard Circular,
is to be found on Pages 44-45 in The Money Manipulators by June Grem.

There also were to be found outlying places in the Orient where the ratio of
gold to silver went as low as l :1 during the 1st Millennium B.C., remaining
so until a very late date, in certain instances. It is reported by Sir Henry
J. Reid, who wrote during the 19th Century, in his book Japan (Chapter
XVIII), that the ratio of silver to gold, governing the use of the precious
metals in settlement of trade balances, was still 1:1 in Japan during the
17th Century A.D.; long after contact with Europeans. The advantage the
European bullion brokers took of this situation with its resultant
disturbance to the status quo, was one of the main factors leading up to the
almost total expulsion of Europeans from Japan during the period 1624 A.D. -
1853 A.D.

24. In its origins in 100 B.C., Lex Majestus (lex appuleia de maiestate
imminuta) was an extension of the definition of treason as being internal
revolt, to include any act impairing the "Majesty" of the Roman people. By
the time of the early Empire, this law had been extended to cover almost any
word or deed against the Emperor, and, it may reasonably be assumed, those
who guided his policies. Spies and informers were everywhere...
Of this period Tacitus wrote at the very beginning of the Annals: "What has
been transmitted to us concerning Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero,
cannot be received without great distrust." He further wrote in "The
Histories: "... But when the battle of Actium had been fought and the
interests of peace demanded the concentration of power in the hands of one
man, this great line of classical historians came to an end. Truth suffered
in more ways than one. To an understandable ignorance of policy, which now
lay outside public control, was in due course added a passion for flattery
or else a hatred for autocrats... Adulation bears the ugly taint of
subservience, but malice gives the false impression of being independent..."
(The Histories; I.I.; Tr. K. Wellesley; London; 1964.)
25. It is to be noted that the seal to the establishment of Gyges on the
throne of Candaules, otherwise known as Myrsilus last king of Hittite
descent on the throne of Lydia, and who he had cuckolded and destroyed,
apparently with the ready assistance of Candaules' wife, was the
pronouncement of the Pythian Oracle (Herodotus, Book I). Clearly the Oracles
would be one of the most important instruments of the international money
creative power towards the furtherance of its purposes; and it would have
sought, as much as possible, to keep them under its control.

H.S. Foxwell who wrote the preface to this work in giving the reasons why no
adequate history of the Bank of England appears to have been written
previous to Andreades: " The first is the remarkable absence of official
records in connection with the Bank, especially for the first century of its
activity. It has often been observed that the English are peculiarly
fortunate in this matter of records; ... The Bank of England stands out as a
striking exception to the rule. It never seems to have published any reports
or even to have preserved its own minutes and accounts."
