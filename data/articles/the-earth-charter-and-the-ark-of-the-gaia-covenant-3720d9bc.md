For those who may have dismissed the notion of a
UN Agenda for a
New World Religion used to usher in
sweeping anti-constitutional environmental agreements, I offer the
following.
"The real goal of the Earth Charter is that
it will in fact become like the Ten Commandments."
Maurice Strong
"Do not do unto the environment of others what you do not want done to
your own environment... My hope is that this charter will be a kind of
Ten Commandments, a 'Sermon on the Mount', that provides a guide for
human behavior toward the environment in the next century."
Mikhail Gorbachev
The Los
Angeles Times, May 8, 1997
World Summit on Sustainable
Development:
Johannesburg 2002
On September the 9th, 2001 a celebration of the
Earth Charter was held at Shelburne Farms Vermont for the unveiling of the
Earth Charter's final resting place.
This "Ark of Hope" will be presented to the
United Nations along with its contents in June of 2002. It is hoped that the
United Nations will endorse the Earth Charter document on this occasion; the
tenth anniversary of the UNCED Earth Summit in Rio.
Placed within the Ark, along with the Earth Charter, were various items
called "Temenos Books" and "Temenos Earth Masks."
Temenos is a concept adopted by Carl
Jung to denote a magic circle, a sacred space where special rules and
energies apply. Some of the Temenos Books were created within this
magic circle by children, who filled them with visual affirmations for
Mother Earth.
Fashioned with the "earth elements", the
Temenos Earth Masks were also worn and created by children.
Maurice Strong and the
"Agenda"
In 1992
Maurice Strong was the Secretary General of the historic
United Nations (UNCED) Earth conference in Rio.
This gathering featured an international cast of
powerful figures in the environmental movement, government, business, and
entertainment. Maurice Strong's wife Hannah, was involved in the NGO
alternative meeting at the Summit called Global Forum '92.
The Dalai Lama opened the meeting and,
according to author Gary Kah, to ensure the success of the forum, Hanne
Strong held a three-week vigil with Wisdomkeepers, a group of "global
transformationalists." Through round-the-clock sacred fire, drumbeat, and
meditation, the group helped hold the "energy pattern" for the duration of
the summit.
It was hoped that an Earth Charter would be the result of this event. This
was not the case, however an international agreement was adopted
Agenda 21
which layed down the international "sustainable development" necessary to
form a future Earth Charter agreement.
Maurice Strong hinted at the overtly pagan
agenda proposed for a future Earth Charter, when in his opening address to
the Rio Conference delegates he said,
"It is the responsibility of each human
being today to choose between the force of darkness and the force of
light."
[Note:
Alice Bailey, and Blavatsky before her, used these terms often.
Their writings state that the 'force of darkness' are those who adhere to
the 'out-dated' Judeo-Christian faith; those who continue along their 'separative'
paths of the one true God. The 'force of light' (Lucifer), in there view, is
the inclusive new age doctrine of a pagan pantheistic New World Religion. In
the New Age of Aquarius there will be no room for the 'force of darkness'
and 'separativeness'.]
"We must therefore transform our attitudes
and adopt a renewed respect for the SUPERIOR LAWS OF DIVINE NATURE,"
Strong finished with unanimous applause from the crowd.
Despite the disappointing setback of no official
agreement toward a "peoples Earth Charter", Maurice Strong forged
ahead, with
Rockefeller backing, to form his
Earth Council Organization for the express purpose of helping
governments implement UNCED's sustainable development which Agenda 21
had outlined.
Agenda 21 was perhaps the biggest step
taken to facilitate any future "enforcement" of a patently pagan Earth
Charter.
According to Strong,
"the Charter will stand on it's own. It will
be in effect, to use an Anglo-Saxon term, the Magna Carta of the people
around the Earth. But, it will also, we hope, lead to action by the
governments through the United Nations."
ARK OF OUR DEMISE?
"Cosmos is my God. Nature is my God."
Mikhail Gorbachev, on the PBS
Charlie Rose Show, Oct. 23, 1996
"A post-christian belief system is taking over one that sees the
earth as a living being mythologically, as Gaia, Earth Mother with
mankind as her consciousness... Such worship of the universe is
properly called cosmolatry."
Donna Steichen, Ungodly Rage,
p. 237
The New Age and the
Radical-Left 'Enlightenment'
The "For Love of Earth" day-long celebrations at Shelburne Farms Vermont
began with an early morning pilgrimage during which 2000 or so participants,
led by Satish Kumar, walked to the "great barn" where they were greeted by
the sounds of the "Sun Song" played by musician Paul Winter.
The Pagan festivities continued with the words
of Dr. Jane Goodall, Satish Kumar and organizer Dr. Steven
C. Rockefeller. The Earth worshippers were treated to dance, music and
paintings of several Vermont artists, after which they joined hands and
offered an "Earth prayer" of "reverence" and "commitment" to Mother Earth
and the "Ark of Hope".
Satish Kumar, who led the early morning pilgrimage at Shelburne Farms, is an
an influential advocate of Gaia. Kumar says that "contemporary thinkers of
the green movement are collectively developing an ecological world-view."
The Earth Charter is the green movement's
crowning achievement toward this holistic world-view, and the practical
means by which all of us will soon be held accountable to "Divine Nature".
According to Satish Kumar,2 this pagan view has
five ingredients:
-
Gaia (James Lovelock)
-
Deep Ecology (Arne Naess)
-
Permaculture (Bill Mollison)
-
Bioregionalism (Gary Snyder et al.)
-
Creation Spirituality (Matthew Fox)
"Creation Spirituality" is what had,
undoubtedly, taken place at the Shelburne Farms Earth Charter
celebrations. In the words of Steven W. Mosher, president of
Population Research Institute,
"Gaia is the New Age term for Mother Earth.
The New Age believers hold that the earth is a sentient super-being,
kind of goddess, deserving of worship and, some say, human sacrifice.
Compared to Gaia worship, the simple animism of primitive cultures is
wholesome."
Musician Paul Winter also has deep roots
within the green movement and "creation spirituality."
He has performed concerts at the Cathedral St.
John the Divine in New York City, on the solstice and equinox, for well over
twenty years. These pagan festivals, in a supposedly christian church
nonetheless, are generously sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation and a
new age organization called the
Lindisfarne Institute the latter of which
has its headquarters in the Cathedral.
Maurice Strong is also a member of Lindisfarne
(publishers of G-A-I-A, a way of knowing) along with Gaia theory biologist
James Lovelock, and admitted Luciferian David Spangler, among others.
Paul Winters' most recent concert at St. John
the Divine was for the annual Earth Mass, on 7 October.3 The fact that this
annual October 7th Earth Mass coincides with the hindu Holy Day of
Dassehra (worship of the Great Divine Mother) cannot be a coincidence.
Winter and band-mates play a tune called Missa Gaia as part of the Feast of
St. Francis.
The Pope once attended the Feast of St. Francis
at St. John the Divine in 1986. Stressing the unity of all the world's
religions, John Paul II happily shared the platform with a Tibetan Lama, a
Hindu swami, a Native American medicine man, and a Moari high priest.
The New American Insider Report of January 23, 19954 writes that the
historic Episcopal Cathedral of Saint John the Divine,
"has long been a center of New Age and
radical-left 'enlightenment' and high-brow Establishment 'culture'."
Author Gary Kah reports, in his
well-documented book The New World Religion, that the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine displays,
"a female Christ on the cross, complete with
shapely hips and full breasts."
Also in the same issue of The New American
there is a list of donors to the Cathedral:

Earth Charter Commission
Co-Chairs
The Earth Charter Initiative was launched in 1994 by Maurice
Strong, his newly formed Earth Council and Mikhail Gorbachev,
acting in his capacity as president of Green Cross International.
In 1997, the Earth Council and Green Cross
International formed an Earth Charter Commission to give oversight to
the process.

The Global
Transformational Movement
A final version of the Earth Charter was issued by the Earth
Charter Commission in March 2000.
The Earth Charter,
"was drafted in coordination with a hard law
treaty that is designed to provide an integrated legal framework for all
environment development law and policy."
This hard law treaty is called the
International Covenant on Environment and Development and is being
prepared by the Commission on Environmental Law at the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a
behemoth agency which oversees 700+ governmental agencies worldwide.
The Earth Charter, consisting of 16 principles, has its roots in the values
of the Transformational Movement. Jan Roberts, president of the
Institute for Ethics and Meaning describes this Transformational
Movement as a paradigm shift from individualism, self-interest and
separativeness, to unity, wholeness and community.
Steven C. Rockefeller was the prime
candidate for the leadership role as co-chair of the Earth Charter Steering
Committee, the Drafting Committee and co-chair of the final Earth Charter
Commission. Besides being a professor of Religion and Ethics at Middlebury
College, expounding the virtues of "creation-centered theology," in his
capacity as trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, his family's resources
ensured the success of the project.
It's clear that the global transformationalists are promoting the Earth
Charter as the "new scripture." At the presentation of the Ark, and its "new
gospel" contents, we can expect that it will be endorsed by the U.N.
The halls of the United Nations has long been a
haven for New Age one-world religion spirituality.
Former Secretary-Generals like Dag
Hammarskjold (founder of the U.N. Meditation Room), U Thant and
former Assistant Secretary-General Robert Muller have long been
outspoken advocates of a new pantheistic global spirituality, using the U.N.
as a vehicle to spread their doctrine.
The United Nations even has their own in-house prophet, Sri Chinmoy.
This 70 year-old indian mystic is the official
Spiritual Advisor to the United Nations. For the past 23 years he has
offered prayer and meditation meetings for anyone to attend every Tuesday
and Friday at the U.N. Sri Chinmoy claims to have been Thomas Jefferson
in a previous life, and he also claims to be the spiritual brother to
Jesus Christ.
Chinmoy's disciples claim he's one of a handful
of fully enlightened beings on the planet. Some disciples go so far as to
claim he is an avatar, a living God. They meditate to a print of his
face.
Perhaps the final resting place for the "Ark of Hope" will be in the United
Nation's Holy-of-Holies, the U.N. meditation room.
"We have the UN Meditation Room, which is
visited by hundreds of thousands of visitors a year," Robert Muller
explains in his book Genesis: Shaping a Global Spirituality.
"We have also a UN Meditation Group led by
an Indian Mystic. One could tell several moving stories of the spiritual
transformation the UN has caused, to the point that this little speck on
earth is becoming a holy ground."
(quoted in The New World Religion, by
Gary Kah, p. 310)
To Sri Chinmoy and Robert Muller, world peace
will ultimately depend,
"on divine and cosmic government" and an
"alliance between all major religions and the U.N."
Muller has gone so far as to call the U.N.
"the body of Christ."
The United Nations "will be the last word in
human perfection," Sri Chinmoy proclaims, it will "stand as the pinnacle
of divine enlightenment."
The Earth Charter stresses that man is
his own savior. By saving "mother earth" we will once again return to an
ideal Garden of Eden.
But instead of worshipping the Creator, the New
Age Aquarian conspirators wish to plunge us headlong into a
creation-worship new world religion.
"Little by little a planetary prayer book is
thus being composed by an increasingly united humanity seeking its
oneness," Robert Muller preaches. "Once again, but this time on a
universal scale, humankind is seeking no less than its reunion with
'divine,' its transcendence into higher forms of life.
Hindus call our earth Brahma, or God,
for they rightly see no difference between our earth and the divine.
This ancient simple truth is slowly dawning again upon humanity, as we
are about to enter our cosmic age and become what we were always meant
to be: the planet of God."
