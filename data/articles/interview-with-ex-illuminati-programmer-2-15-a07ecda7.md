# Interview with Ex Illuminati Programmer 2 - 15

Q: Svali, what role does television play? From your point of view,
as an ex-Illuminati trainer/programmer, how much of a mind-control
device 'really' is it? How does it interact with the brain, what
sounds and images are used for programming? What makes TV the
perfect mind-control device for the masses? Give us some details
please.
A: It is important to realize that when a person watches
TV,
they go into an alpha brain wave state, in which they are more
suggestible than normal. In fact, a LOT of Illuminati programming is
done in alpha state, since the person is relaxed and highly
suggestible. Have you ever noticed the glazed expression on the face
of a person who has been watching TV for any length of time? This is
from being in prolonged alpha state, and a semi dissociative state
(and this is for people who HAVE NOT been raised with mind control).
Also, remember those studies that stated that "TV violence doesn't
affect children's behavior" years ago? Guess who funded them? They
are a bunch of bull-crud. What a person watches DOES influence them,
and this is well known by the behaviorists in the group. In fact,
they know that TV is a tool that they purposely use to influence
"the masses". It cannot create a total personality change in the
average citizen, but it can desensitize us increasingly to violence,
pornography and the occult, and influence the perceptions of young
children.
Most cartoons have a subtle message as well as subliminal ones meant
to influence the next generation of children, destroy family values
and old fashioned "morality" as being "Christian Right" or
"prejudiced" or "politically incorrect'. TV today has a profound
influence on our society, and especially young children. How many
parents have delegated it as their children's babysitter, yet have
no idea what their children watch?
I am horrified at times to hear about the movies that my 12 year old
son tells me his friends have watched : movies that depict mass
murders, violence, and occult evil. I would never let an
impressionable child watch the Matrix, Fight Club, or the new
Exorcist, for example, or the "slasher movies" that are so popular
among some teens.
Sounds and images include: flashing images and constant changes
(such as with MTV videos, for example, or many of the new ads);
certain tones are played on some shows, or even the theme of the
show, if it glorifies the occult, such as many of the popular shows
depicting a cute young teen witch as the heroine, or vampires and
demonic shape shifting.
Q: What are some of the major Illuminati inspired shows running on
TV, or the ones carrying an Illuminati message and what clues
identify them as such?
A: The media is so infiltrated, a better question is which ones
DON'T promote their agenda? See the above, also: Saturday morning
cartoons that show animals/people morphing (a well known occult
phenomena), or that glorify the concepts of "Earth, Water, Fire"
(the Magickal Elements); or those that blatantly show mind control
techniques (even video games, such as Tomb Raider, or "Metal Gear
Solid" show training chairs and people being tortured, which
surprised and saddened me. The hero has to "rescue" the person
before they are tortured to death...
I would guess that 90% of current cartoons have mystical/occult
themes that are geared to catch children and subtly indoctrinate
them to accept: animal guides or spirit guides, the idea of training
(even cute little Pokemons turn from docile creatures into snarling
demonic fighters after their "trainer" helps them change, which is
too close for comfort for me to what the Illuminists do to docile
children).
I personally don't watch much TV, for this very reason. I might
watch a National Geographic special once in awhile, or rarely a
movie on the Comedy channel, but otherwise, I avoid it. I heard too
many discussions during leadership meetings and with other
behaviorists in the group about how it was being used to subtly
influence the masses without their even suspecting it. I choose to
step away from this influence. Look at what TV depicted in the 1940s
and 1950s, and what is accepted now as okay, to chronicle the slow
moral decline of our society.
Q: How about the influence of
pop music? Does it pose a danger, is
it used as a mind-control medium? I believe Cathy O'Brien, a
CIA
mind-control slave and survivor, implicated the country music scene
and a number of singers as being mind-control slaves, and names
Nashville, Ten. as the center.
A: Country music may have some, but the rock music industry is
much more heavily controlled. I once watched some MTV and could NOT
believe what was on it, my mouth fell open from shock. There is a
song/video that is very popular right now by CrazyTown, that shows
butterfly tattoos all over the people (a sign of Monarch mind
control) while he sings "Come my butterfly"...later he sings about
her escaping to a better world, etc.
This song is FILLED with programming images. I believe that
Brittany
Spears, Eminem, and others are being used by them to sing lyrics
they like (ever notice that he wears a Neo-Nazi look and sings hate
lyrics? This is NOT by chance). In fact, many of the top pop singers
come from an internship with the "Mickey Mouse club" (yep, good old
Walt the Illuminist's Empire) and I believe they are offered stardom
in exchange for allegiance or mind control.
How many lyrics advocate suicide, violence, despair, or New Age
spirituality in pop/rock today? Or just get a copy of the words and
read (but be aware that many are possibly triggering to survivors of
mind control).
Q: Is there any way to undo the mind-control damage already done by
and through television and music?
A: Turn it off. Easier said than done. Once the input stops, it
isn't constantly reinforced. How many people are almost addicted to
their TV time? I also believe that one of the best methods of
undoing damage is by replacing negative or false messages with the
truth. I go to God's word in daily Bible Study to "renew my mind",
as Romans states, and I find this much more healing and uplifting
than anything on TV or the pop radio stations.
Q: Svali, I am sure you remember the Pokemon seizure scare a few
years ago. [Here are some links to refresh your memory:
Seizure or Hysteria? Japanese cartoon triggers seizures in hundreds
of children.]
Did the cartoon producers/animators stumble on this accidentally or
was this some kind of public mind-control 'test'? Is this something
Illuminati programmers are aware of, and use in mind-control? What's
your opinion on this?
A: I have no idea if it was intentional or not, since it
happened after I left the group, and I never heard any discussion
about it. But I will tell you that I do NOT let my son watch Pokemon,
even when he tells me that "all his friends do". I believe the show
has strongly demonic undertones (why do the eyes of the characters
turn "red" when they morph into their fighting mode, which seems
very much like a person in fighting mode who has gone through mind
control with demonic overlays?).
I can't stand the show myself, in spite of
Picachu's popularity, and
am saddened that it had the effect that it did on children. I do
know that the alpha wave effect I mentioned before means that yes,
the children ARE "totally immersed" in the program, as noted by the
person in one article.
Have you ever watched a young child who is watching cartoons like
this? Their eyes glaze, their jaw goes slack, and they stop
EVERYTHING and even breathe more slowly. Once again, I am not a fan
of TV per se for this very reason, and especially for young
children. The increased violence in our society can be directly
related to the increased exposure to it that the very young have.
How many children have learned to laugh at gore and meaningless
violence as being "funny"? There is even a popular comedy show on
MTV that shows young men abusing their parent and videotaping it for
"laughs". I have problems with mindless cruelty to others being
funny.
Q: Here is an article that you may find of interest:

25TH SHOT FOUND IN POKEMON CARTOONS
Psychologists in the Russias southern city of Krasnodar have called
on the Russian government to ban televising of the Pokemon Japanese
cartoon. The cartoon has already been televised on Russias
state-controlled ORT nationwide television network, as many
countries, including Japan itself, have tabooed it.
Krasodar
psychologists assert that a 25th shot system is applied in the
cartoon which negatively affects childrens sub-consciousness. As a
result of this shots impact, a ''neuro-linguistic programming''
occurs, or, to put it in other words, zombying.
The psychologists
characterize this phenomena as the ''intellectual genocide.'' In
their view, the cartoon calls for cruelty and aggression, while
numerous signs on the heroes' costumes symbolize death.
A: I'm not sure what the "25th shot system" is, but obviously
Russia has recognized it as some sort of subliminal frame set that
has a detrimental effect on children (why am I not surprised, I've
already shared my opinion of Pokemon...). And Magick, another card
game, is even worse. Also, think of the role playing games that
teens get sucked into, such as D&D online, or Diablo, and others.
The list goes on.
