The operation to flush out the leadership of the
dark cabal has now zeroed in on the World Economic Forum at Davos,
according to agents involved.
Italian
P2 lodge member Daniel Dal Bosco,
who has been under complete 24-hour surveillance since absconding with over
$1 trillion in financial instruments, has led investigators to Giancarlo
Bruno, Head of the Financial Services Industry at the World
Economic Forum, investigators say.
The latest breakthrough in the ongoing criminal investigation has created a
state of extreme tension in Western power corridors, especially Washington
and Geneva.
The world will not be the same when this is
over, a senior CIA source says.
The conversation intercepted between Dal Bosco
and Bruno is like something out of a weird spy movie, the investigators say.
It can be paraphrased as follows:
Dal Bosco: You need to help me, I am being
followed by about 30 spaceships.
Bruno: I told you never to contact me, no matter what.
According to investigators there are now more
spies than normal citizens in the small Italian town where Dal Bosco is now
staying and the pressure is beginning to wear on him. Neither Dal Bosco nor
Bruno were available for comment at the time of this writing.
The trail from Bruno leads to the leadership of
the
United Nations as well as
the
Obama regime in Washington, the investigators say.
There is a long list of arrest warrants that has been readied and you can be
sure a lot of people will be skipping the next Davos meeting out of fear of
being arrested.
The air in Washington is so thick now with
tension that you could cut it with a knife, a
White Dragon Society source close to
the action in D.C. says.
The tensions and divisions within the secret
Western government are leading to ever more incidents, reaching the public
eye.
-
In one incident, the body of Yuri
Ivanov Deputy Head of GRU was found accidentally drowned, last
week. He was in Syria helping prevent World War 3 from breaking
out in the Middle East.
-
Then we have the case of MI6 Spy
Garreth Williams, who was found stuffed inside a bag in his
bathroom. The case is creating thick clouds of disinformation.
-
Then we have the on-again, off-again
rape charges against Julian Assange of
Wikileaks.
All these incidents point to deep
division between various Western intelligence and police agencies. However,
the Italians are looking especially isolated in all this.
In China, meanwhile, factional tensions are also rising with three main
factions allying themselves with different factions in the battle for
control over the financial system of the West.
There are also three factions in the West battling over the new financial
system.
-
The incumbent faction is the
New World Order faction that still
hopes to
start World War 3 and start a
global fascist government.
-
Against them is the informal alliance
that believes control over the world financial system should belong
to the people of the planet
-
A third faction just sits on the fence
waiting to ally themselves with the victor
At the heart of this battle right now is the
question of who will control
the planned Amero currency.
Preparations for the launch of the Amero are now being finalized. Already
the new gold-backed currency has been printed and distributed to the worlds
various central banks. The governments of Canada and Mexico have also signed
on. Average humans will be able to trade two dollars for one Amero.
The various countries holding US debt have each been offered their own rate.
We do not know the details but have heard the Chinese got the best deal
while the Japanese got one of the worst deals.
What remains to be decided is what sort of organization will oversee the
creation and distribution of new Amero. That is why the operation to flush
out the true owners of the
Federal Reserve Board is crucial.
As for the Euro, so far no deal has been reached and the currency still
appears to be doomed. Dust off your Deutschemarks if you have any
is our advice.
Although the turbulence and tension is expected to continue possibly for
another two years, it is quite clear that all the major global structures
created after World War 2 will be totally changed when the dust finally
settles.
The Trillion Dollar Criminal Case
...Against Top Davos, UN Officials & Others Will Go Ahead
Despite Sudden Death of Key Witness

Criminal charges will be filed this week in New Jersey in a $1 trillion
robbery case that implicates top officials of the
World Economic Forum (Davos) top
United Nations officials including UN Secretary General Ban Ki
Moon and members of the Italian
P2 Masonic Lodge, according to top US law
enforcement officials and lawyers for the owners of the over $1 trillion in
stolen financial instruments.
The individual directly responsible for stealing
the funds, P2s Daniele Dal Bosco was recorded asking Giancarlo
Bruno Head of the Financial Services Industry at Davos to have myself
and three other individuals murdered.
In addition, Joe Bendana, the man who
assisted in the case within the US on behalf of Neil Keenan and also
provided affidavits to other governments and Interpol was also threatened
directly by Dal Bosco 4 days before he was found murdered in his residence,
Newark, New Jersey, last Saturday, September 4, 2010.
Police are treating the death of Bendana as a
homicide because of the threats and because there was a security breach at
his residence the night he died.
As soon as Brunos name was made public by this writer, we were contacted by
a senior P2 Lodge member who offered an international scoop, involving
impossible amounts of Philippine gold, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and
an individual by the name of Marco Di Mauro.
This photograph of an alleged
Philippine bond worth Five Hundred
Dodecallion USD-CFR-Trilateral Commission, was sent as proof.
There is no such number as a Dodecallion
but the bond had number 5 followed by 46 zeroes.
We are waiting for more coherent information
from this source. The
Trilateral Commission was founded in July
of 1973. Clearly it does not fall in line with the date, October 24-25,
1966, issued on the Mother Gold Guarantee Deposit.
How could this have been issued when the
Trilateral Commission did not exist at this time? I believe they are
attempting to discredit this writer.
The entire incident began in June 2009 when two Japanese were illegally
detained by Italian Treasury police and had $134.5 billion worth of bonds
they were carrying confiscated. This incident was reported briefly in the
international media before being dismissed as a fraud. However, the
Japanese were not detained because they had diplomatic passports.
The bonds were real and were illegally
confiscated by the Italian Treasury Police.
Shortly after this incident, the P2 Lodge, at the bequest of the Italian
Police offered to assist them in cashing these bonds, which are owned by an
astronomically wealthy Asian family. They offered the bonds back to this
family at 10% of the face value but the family had no intention of allowing
themselves to be extorted relating to bonds they already owned.
At a later date a family associate agreed to
protect a further $1 trillion worth of financial instruments and they were
placed into the custodianship of P2 banker Daniele Dal Bosco (Mr. Dal
Bosco is actually not a banker nor ever has been a banker).
Dal Bosco then absconded with the bonds and tried to cash them variously
with the UN with the assistance of Giancarlo Bruno of the World Economic
Forum who is one of the coordinators. It is purported that Mr. Bruno set
up the entire operation with the UN and OITC which Dal Bosco turned to for
support once they recognized that Neil Keenan was not going to allow them to
steal the bonds.
Dal Bosco states that he is working with his
lawyer, Interpol and the UN but makes it perfectly clear to this writer that
he refers everything over to OITC (he has no attorney holding the bonds to
respond to), has never spoken to Interpol and the UN and Dal Bosco/Bruno/World
Economic Forum/UN/David Sale/OITC are some of the known co-conspirators of
this theft.
The OITC is headed by a Cambodian by the name of
R.C. Dam.
Dam was at one point the designated heir of
Indonesias Sukarno as signatory to a large pool of gold stored in various
parts of Asia (This is the same gold that was supposed to back the new US
dollar that President Kennedy was assassinated for trying to issue).
However, Dam was stripped of this power after
the OITC was involved in a series of fraud
cases. As a result, the bonds cannot be cashed by them. Italian Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi also tried unsuccessfully to cash the
bonds with the Chinese government.
Dal Bosco has been under complete surveillance since the beginning of this
incident. That is why intelligence agencies recorded his requests for murder
contracts and his threats to various individuals. Furthermore case files
have been opened up against Dal Bosco in Milan, Italy and in Interpol.
Interpol is now actively involved as are most of the worlds intelligence
agencies because they believe the trail in this case will lead eventually to
the World Economic Forum, the UN and a group of Oligarchs who have been
plotting to create a fascistic world government. These Oligarchs have also
been trying to start World War 3 and carry out an unprecedented genocide of
two thirds of the worlds population.
This case also illustrates some of the absurd and bizarre goings on now
taking place in the esoteric world of high finance.
Senior sources report there is still chaos in the Western corridors of
power, especially Washington D.C. because of the impending bankruptcy of the
Federal Reserve Board.
There are moves, reported in our last
newsletter, to
launch a Gold Backed Amero to replace the US dollar.
However, a different faction is still pushing for a Gold backed Treasury
dollar controlled by the Congress. There is no conclusion to this fight but
the turmoil is expected to intensify as the September 31 US fiscal year end
approaches.
Because of this chaos Chinese and Asian sources are now offering to sell
large denominations of US Dollars and Euros at a 37% discount to
super-wealthy individuals.
The only thing that is certain about all these financial shenanigans is that
the global governmental structures set up after World War 2 are all starting
to collapse.
