As the
sanctions against the Russian government continue to be implemented by
western nations, Moscow has been forced to look to Asia for economic and
strategic partnerships.
The Kremlin
has been negotiating significant trade deals with two giants in the region
for years now, with the prospect of a new geopolitical reality emerging if
Russia, Iran and China continue to forge stronger ties into the future.
At the beginning of August, Russia
and Iran signed a historic $20 billion oil deal which will see the two
nations enhancing cooperation within the "oil and gas industry", in addition
to strengthening economic collaboration.
The deal proposes that Russia will assist Tehran
in developing its energy infrastructure along with purchasing Iranian oil,
in exchange for Iran importing consumer goods and agriculture products
including wheat, leather, pulses and meat.
Further talks are set to take place at
the Russia-Iran intergovernmental commission meeting in Tehran on September
9-10, which will see the details of the deal cemented.
Relations between the two nations are complex
and have ranged from collaborative to hostile in the last few decades, with
a degree of tension existing between Moscow and Tehran over many issues
today. The Caspian Sea is one dispute that has strained relations between
the five bordering countries since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the
early 1990's.
Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and
Turkmenistan are unable to agree on the legal portion owned by each state,
in a sea which is home to vast deposits of oil and gas.
Iran has also been displeased by Russia's
support of United Nations Security Council Resolutions which have
imposed sanctions on Iran over the past decade, stunting the development
of the Iranian economy.
Yet the two nations have increasingly found
themselves sharing the same geostrategic interests, especially in their
support of Bashar al-Assad in his fight against western sponsored
proxy forces
in Syria. A closer strategic alliance
with Iran could also benefit Russia through Tehran providing regional
assistance to help stabilize the Caucasus and Central Asia.
A vast amount of terrorist cells - which have close
links to the CIA - have been active in the Caucasus for years now, in an
effort to destabilize the underbelly of the Russia Federation.
A Resource Rich Alliance
The strength of Iran and Russia is underpinned
by the two powers holding considerable deposits of oil and gas, and an
increase in cooperation between Tehran and Moscow could be mutually
beneficial considering the sanctions imposed on each state.
Iran is a natural dominant player
in
the Middle East as it has the "fourth-largest
proved crude oil reserves" on earth, along with the "world's
second-largest natural gas reserves", in addition to having the 3rd largest
population in the region - of over
80 million.
Russia holds the largest natural gas reserves in
the world along with the eighth largest proved crude oil reserves.
Moscow could be an essential importer of Iranian
oil as the latest round of sanctions, imposed by the United States (US) and
the European Union (EU) in 2011/2012, have had a sizable affect on the
production and revenues received from the Iranian energy sector.
Export revenues from oil and gas have plunged by
47% in the fiscal year 2012/2013 to $63 billion, according to the IMF,
compared to an export revenue of $118 billion the previous year.
Russia has also announced it will build a rail
line in the North of Iran, running from the city of Rasht on the Caspian
Sea to Astara on the Azerbaijan border.
The decision by western leaders to impose
sanctions on Russia in March has pushed Moscow closer to Iran and China, as
well as strengthening
the BRICS group and the Eurasian Economic
Community.
In May, Russia and China agreed what was hailed
by many analysts as the 'deal of the decade', when the two powers signed a 30
year gas deal totaling $400 billion. China and Iran also plan to boost
trade over the next 10 years by a factor of 5, with trade expected to reach $200
billion by 2024, compared to $40 billion in 2013.
Iran is a major supplier of crude oil to China
with demand set to remain high as Beijing is now the largest
net importer of crude oil, surpassing the US in September of last year.
If the trend continues into the future, the
emergence of a Russian-Iranian-Sino alliance would come to dominate the
continent of Asia, and if truly independent of western influence, would
seriously challenge the Anglo-American international order.
