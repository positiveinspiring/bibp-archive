The war in Afghanistan - where the enemy is elusive and rarely seen, where
the cultural and linguistic disconnect makes every trip outside the wire a
visit to hostile territory, where it is clear that you are losing despite
the vast industrial killing machine at your disposal - feeds the culture of
atrocity.
The fear and stress, the anger and hatred,
reduce all Afghans to the enemy, and this includes women, children and the
elderly. Civilians and combatants merge into one detested nameless, faceless
mass.
The psychological leap to murder is short. And
murder happens every day in Afghanistan.
It happens in drone strikes, artillery
bombardments, airstrikes, missile attacks and the withering suppressing fire
unleashed in villages from belt-fed machine guns.
Military attacks like these in civilian areas
make discussions of human rights an absurdity.
Robert Bales, a U.S. Army staff sergeant who
allegedly killed 16 civilians in two Afghan villages, including nine
children, is not an anomaly.
To decry the butchery of this case and to defend
the wars of occupation we wage is to know nothing about combat. We kill
children nearly every day in Afghanistan. We do not usually kill them
outside the structure of a military unit. If an American soldier had killed
or wounded scores of civilians after the ignition of an improvised explosive
device against his convoy, it would not have made the news.
Units do not stick around to count their
collateral damage.
But the Afghans know. They hate us for the
murderous rampages. They hate us for our hypocrisy.
The scale of our state-sponsored murder is masked from public view.
Reporters who travel with military units and become psychologically part of
the team spin out what the public and their military handlers want, mythic
tales of heroism and valor. War is seen only through the lens of the
occupiers. It is defended as a national virtue.
This myth allows us to make sense of mayhem and
death. It justifies what is usually nothing more than gross human cruelty,
brutality and stupidity. It allows us to believe we have achieved our place
in human society because of a long chain of heroic endeavors, rather than
accept the sad reality that we stumble along a dimly lit corridor of
disasters. It disguises our powerlessness.
It hides from view the impotence and
ordinariness of our leaders.
But in turning history into myth we transform
random events into a sequence of events directed by a will greater than our
own, one that is determined and preordained. We are elevated above the
multitude. We march to nobility. But it is a lie. And it is a lie that
combat veterans carry within them.
It is why so many commit suicide.
I, too, belong to this species, J. Glenn
Gray
wrote of his experience in World War II. I am ashamed not only of
my own deeds, not only of my nations deeds, but of human deeds as well.
I am ashamed to be a man.
When Ernie Pyle, the famous World War II
correspondent, was killed on the Pacific island of Ie Shima in 1945, a rough
draft of a column was found on his body.
He was preparing it for release upon the end of
the war in Europe. He had done much to promote the myth of the warrior and
the nobility of soldiering, but by the end he seemed to have tired of it
all:
But there are many of the living who have burned into their brains forever
the unnatural sight of cold dead men scattered over the hillsides and in the
ditches along the high rows of hedge throughout the world.
Dead men by mass production - in one country
after another - month after month and year after year. Dead men in
winter and dead men in summer.
Dead men in such familiar promiscuity that they become monotonous.
Dead men in such monstrous infinity that you come almost to hate them.
These are the things that you at home need not
even try to understand.
To you at home they are columns of figures, or
he is a near one who went away and just didnt come back. You didnt see him
lying so grotesque and pasty beside the gravel road in France.
We saw him, saw him by the multiple thousands. Thats the difference.
There is a constant search in all wars to find new perversities, new forms
of death when the initial flush fades, a rear-guard and finally futile
effort to ward off the boredom of routine death.
This is why during the war in El Salvador the
death squads and soldiers would cut off the genitals of those they killed
and stuff them in the mouths of the corpses. This is why we reporters in
Bosnia would find bodies crucified on the sides of barns or decapitated.
This is why U.S. Marines have
urinated on dead Taliban fighters.
Those slain in combat are treated as trophies by
their killers, turned into grotesque pieces of performance art.
It happened in every war I covered.
Force, Simone Weil
wrote, is as pitiless
to the man who possesses it, or thinks he does, as it is to its victims;
the second it crushes, the first it intoxicates.
War perverts and destroys you.
It pushes you closer and closer to your own
annihilation - spiritual, emotional and finally physical. It destroys the
continuity of life, tearing apart all systems - economic, social,
environmental and political - that sustain us as human beings. In war, we
deform ourselves, our essence. We give up individual conscience - maybe even
consciousness - for contagion of the crowd, the rush of patriotism, the
belief that we must stand together as a nation in moments of extremity.
To make a moral choice, to defy wars
enticement, can in the culture of war be self-destructive. The essence of
war is death. Taste enough of war and you come to believe that
the stoics
were right:
We will, in the end, all consume ourselves in a vast
conflagration.
A World War II study determined that, after 60 days of continuous combat, 98
percent of all surviving soldiers will have become psychiatric casualties. A
common trait among the remaining 2 percent was a predisposition toward
having aggressive psychopathic personalities.
Lt. Col. Dave Grossman in his book On Killing:
The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society, notes:
It is not too far from the mark to observe
that there is something about continuous, inescapable combat which will
drive 98 percent of all men insane, and the other 2 percent were crazy
when they got there.
During the war in El Salvador, many soldiers
served for three or four years or longer, as in the U.S. wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, until they psychologically or physically collapsed.
In garrison towns, commanders banned the sale of
sedatives because those drugs were abused by the troops. In that war, as in
the wars in the Middle East, the emotionally and psychologically maimed were
common. I once interviewed a 19-year-old Salvadoran army sergeant who had
spent five years fighting and then suddenly lost his vision after his unit
walked into a rebel ambush.
The rebels killed 11 of his fellow soldiers in
the firefight, including his closest friend. He was unable to see again
until he was placed in an army hospital.
I have these horrible headaches, he told
me as he sat on the edge of his bed. There is shrapnel in my head. I
keep telling the doctors to take it out.
But the doctors told me that he had no head
wounds.
I saw other soldiers in other conflicts go deaf or mute or shake without
being able to stop.
War is necrophilia. This necrophilia is central to soldiering just as it is
central to the makeup of suicide bombers and terrorists. The necrophilia is
hidden under platitudes about duty or comradeship. It is unleashed
especially in moments when we seem to have little to live for and no hope,
or in moments when the intoxication of war is at its highest pitch.
When we spend long enough in war, it comes to us
as a kind of release, a fatal and seductive embrace that can consummate the
long flirtation with our own destruction.
In his memoir Wartime, about the partisan war in Yugoslavia, Milovan
Djilas wrote of the enticement that death held for the combatants.
He stood over the body of his comrade, the
commander Sava Kovacevic, and found:
dying did not seem terrible or unjust.
This was the most extraordinary, the most exalted moment of my life.
Death did not seem strange or undesirable.
That I restrained myself from charging
blindly into the fray and death was perhaps due to my sense of
obligation to the troops or to some comrades reminder concerning the
tasks at hand. In my memory, I returned to those moments many times with
the same feeling of intimacy with death and desire for it while I was in
prison, especially during my first incarceration.
War ascendant wipes out Eros. It wipes out
delicacy and tenderness.
Its communal power seeks to render the
individual obsolete, to hand all passions, all choice, all voice to the
crowd.
The most important part of the individual
life, which cannot be subsumed in communal life, is love, Sebastian
Haffner
wrote in Defying Hitler.
So comradeship has its special weapons
against love: smut. Every evening in bed, after the last patrol round,
there was the ritual reciting of lewd songs and jokes. That is the hard
and fast rule of male comradeship, and nothing is more mistaken than the
widely held opinion that this is a safety valve for frustrated erotic or
sexual feelings. These songs and jokes do not have an erotic, arousing
effect.
On the contrary, they make the act of love
appear as unappetizing as possible. They treat it like digestion and
defecation, and make it an object of ridicule.
The men who recited rude
songs and used coarse words for female body parts were in effect denying
that they ever had tender feelings or had been in love, that they had
ever made themselves attractive, behaved gently...
When we see this, when we see our addiction for
what it is, when we understand ourselves and how war has perverted us, life
becomes hard to bear.
Jon Steele, a cameraman who spent years in war
zones, had a
nervous breakdown in a crowded Heathrow Airport after returning
from Sarajevo. Steele had come to understand the reality of his work, a
reality that stripped away the self-righteous, high-octane gloss.
When he was in Sarajevo he was,
in a place called Snipers Alley, and I
filmed a girl there who had been hit in the neck by a snipers bullet,
he wrote.
I filmed her in the ambulance, and only
after she was dead, I suddenly understood that the last thing she had
seen was the reflection of the lens of the camera I was holding in front
of her. This wiped me out. I grabbed the camera, and started running
down Snipers Alley, filming at knee level the Bosnians running from
place to place.
A year after the end of the war in Sarajevo, I
sat with Bosnian friends who had suffered horribly.
A young woman, Ljiljana, had lost her father, a
Serb, who refused to join the besieging Serb forces around the city. A few
days earlier she had to identify his corpse. The body was lifted, water
running out of the sides of a rotting coffin, from a small park for reburial
in the central cemetery.
Soon she would emigrate to Australia - where,
she told me,
I will marry a man who has never heard of
this war and raise children that will be told nothing about it, nothing
about the country I am from.
Ljiljana was young. But the war had exacted a
toll.
Her cheeks were hollow, her hair dry and
brittle. Her teeth were decayed and some had broken into jagged bits. She
had no money for a dentist; she hoped to have them fixed in Australia. Yet
all she and her friends did that afternoon was lament the days when they
lived in fear and hunger, emaciated, targeted by Serb gunners on the heights
above. They did not wish back the suffering.
And yet, they admitted, those may have been the
fullest days of their lives. They looked at me in despair. I had known them
when hundreds of shells a day fell nearby, when they had no water to bathe
in or wash their clothes, when they huddled in unheated flats as sniper
bullets hit the walls outside.
What they expressed was disillusionment with a sterile, futile and empty
present. Peace had again exposed the void that the rush of war, of battle,
had filled. Once again they were - as perhaps we all are - alone, no longer
bound by a common struggle, no longer given the opportunity to be noble,
heroic, no longer sure of what life was about or what it meant.
The old comradeship, however false, had vanished
with the last shot.
Moreover, they had seen that all the sacrifice had been for naught. They had
been, as we all are in war, betrayed. The corrupt old Communist Party
bosses, who became nationalists overnight and got them into the mess in the
first place, had grown rich off their suffering and were still in power.
Ljiljana and the others faced a 70 percent unemployment rate.
They depended on handouts from the international
community. They understood that their cause, once as fashionable in certain
intellectual circles as they were themselves, lay forgotten. No longer did
actors, politicians and artists scramble to visit during the cease-fires -
acts that were almost always ones of gross self-promotion.
They knew the lie of war, the mockery of their
idealism, and struggled with their shattered illusions. And yet, they wished
it all back, and I did, too.
Later, I received a Christmas card. It was signed Ljiljana from Australia.
It had no return address. I never heard from her
again. But many of those I worked with as war correspondents did not escape.
They could not break free from the dance with death. They wandered from
conflict to conflict, seeking always one more hit.
By then, I was back in Gaza and at one point found myself pinned down in
still another ambush. A young Palestinian 15 feet away was fatally shot
through the chest. I had been lured back but now felt none of the old rush,
just fear. It was time to break free, to let go. I knew it was over for me.
I was lucky to get out alive.
Kurt Schork - brilliant, courageous and driven - could not let go. He died
in an ambush in Sierra Leone along with another friend of mine, Miguel Gil
Moreno. His entrapment - his embrace of Thanatos, of the death instinct -
was never mentioned in the sterile and antiseptic memorial service held for
him in Washington, D.C. Everyone tiptoed around the issue.
But those of us who had known him understood he
had been consumed.
I had worked with Kurt for 10 years, starting in northern Iraq. Literate,
funny - it seems the brave are often funny. He and I passed books back and
forth in our struggle to make sense of the madness around us.
His loss is a hole that will never be filled.
His ashes were placed in Sarajevos Lion Cemetery, for the victims of the
war. I flew to Sarajevo and met the British filmmaker Dan Reed. It was an
overcast November day. We stood over the grave and downed a pint of whiskey.
Dan lit a candle.
I recited a poem the Roman lyric poet Catullus
had written to honor his dead brother.
By strangers costs and waters, many
days at sea,
I come here for the rites of your unworlding,
Bringing for you, the dead, these last gifts of the living
And my words - vain sounds for the man of dust.
Alas, my brother,
You have been taken from me. You have been taken from me,
By cold chance turned a shadow, and my pain.
Here are the foods of the old ceremony, appointed
Long ago for the starvelings under the earth:
Take them: your brothers tears have made them wet: and take
Into eternity my hail and my farewell.
It was there, among 4,000 war dead, that Kurt
belonged.
He died because he could not free himself from war. He had been
trying to replicate what he had found in Sarajevo, but he could not. War
could never be new again. Kurt had been in East Timor and Chechnya. Sierra
Leone, I was sure, meant nothing to him.
Kurt and Miguel could not let go. They would have been the first to admit
it. Spend long enough at war, and you cannot fit in anywhere else. It
finally kills you. It is not a new story. It starts out like love, but it is
death.
War is the beautiful young nymph in the fairy tale that, when kissed,
exhales the vapors of the underworld.
The ancient Greeks had a word for such a fate:
ekpyrosis.
It means to be consumed by a ball of fire. They used it to describe
heroes.
