National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA)
which operates covert space defense, ET research, and space weapons compartments,
in addition to manned Shuttle and unmanned scientific satellite launches.
Some of what NASA does is beneficial. What is not beneficial is the spy
satellites which monitor decent human beings' actions. The cell phone that
you use is monitored by these satellites. Moreover, what gives
NASA the right to perform ET research and have space weapons compartments.
In my humble opinion, they have no right.
We need to promote the positive aspects of NASA while we end the destructive
aspects.
