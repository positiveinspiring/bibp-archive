The Office of the Comptroller of Currency
(OCC) and the Federal Reserve Bank
(FED) have
announced that mega-banks such as,
-
Wells Fargo
-
Bank of America (BoA)
-
JPMorgan & Chase Co.,
...have agreed to pay
$8.5 billion in a settlement promoted by federal complaints that these
institutions wrongfully foreclosed on customers.
These banks mishandled paperwork and neglected
requirements during the foreclosure process.
Other banks involved in the agreement are:
-
Citigroup
-
MetLife
-
PNC Financial Services
-
SunTrust
-
US Bank
-
Sovereign
-
GMAC Mortgage
-
HSBC Finance Group
-
EMC Mortgage Corp
The billions are being paid to homeowners who
have suffered harm.
Although actual compensation is not being
offered, the banks hope that this money will satiate the masses.
According to the agreement 3.8 million Americans
who were foreclosed on between 2009-2010 will receive an average of
$2,237.00, while another $5.2 billion will be made available to compensate
for loan modifications.
Thomas Curry, Comptroller of the
Currency, stated that the 2011 order produced this deal that ensures,
consumers are the ones who will benefit,
and that they will benefit more quickly and in a more direct manner.
The agreement is also another get out of jail
free card that caps the banks compensation obligations to homeowners that
were financially damaged by the mortgage-backed securities debacle created
by the banks themselves.
By admitting to foreclosure abuse, the
mega-banks have agreed to a minor amount of financial penalties that will
resonate well with the American public.
BoA has agreed to
$10.3 billion between their bank and Fannie Mae, the mortgage
corporation owned by the federal government.
The appearance that the banks are willing to
settle their debts to the homeowners in the US is causing a stir and
providing the much needed positive press while policymakers prepare to
redefine the parameters of the mortgage market.
The industry will consolidate in an effort to
give lenders more confidence while causing fewer technocrats to actually
control the future of American property owners.
The Countrywide
acquisition has become a sore spot to BoA and the settlement is evidence
of this. The misrepresentation of the quality of the loans and securities
has resulted in a case being filed against BoA CIFG Assurance of North
America, Inc.
The settlement devised by the OCC and the
Federal Reserve has
prevented Congress from reviewing the Independent Foreclosure Review
process which came to the amount agreed upon in the settlement. The Federal
Reserve and OCC also decided who would benefit from the settlement and how
much they would be compensated.
This agreement was rushed into fruition as if
the Federal Reserve and OCC had pressure to come to a determination.
In the end, the agreement allows the banks to
sweep under the rug their involvement in the mortgage-backed securities
fraud and illegal foreclosures by their outline of who was victimized and
how they would be dealt with.
The Bank of International Settlements (BIS)
and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisors (BCBS)
has applied the
underlying pressure on US banks to liquidate to appease global markets. The
American taxpayer is picking up the tab for this turn of events. BIS is
giving these banks until 2019 to comply with their new rules.
Capital to prop up the banks will be needed
while they liquidate assets such as bonds, mortgages, loans and stock
shares.
Consequences of the liquidation have been
evidenced in governmental austerity and movement toward sovereign debt by
the technocrats. Any asset assessed by BIS can and is being used as
collateral of the banksters in an anything goes temperament while the
squandering of wealth continues.
BIS has used the scheme of
forcing capital from the banks to control the measures taken globally.
International banking constraints mandated in these new rules are putting
more control into the hands of shadow banks where supervision is unheard
of.
Michel Barnier, commissioner of BIS,
stated that the Basel Committee has,
revised liquidity coverage ratio and the
gradual approach for its phasing-in by clearly defined dates. This is
significant progress which addresses issues already raised by the
European Commission.
We now need to make full use of the
observation period, and learn from the reports that the European Banking
Authority will prepare on the results of the observation period, before
formally implementing in 2015 the liquidity coverage ratio under EU law
in line with the Basel standards.
Liquidity is seen by the technocrats as a
necessity for,
the stability of banks as well as for their
role in supporting wider economic recovery.
At a time when the introduction of a global
currency to replace all fiat across the globe is at hand, it makes perfect
sense that the technocrats are positioning themselves to control the central
banks as offshoot branches of their operation.
At the head of this monster, the BIS sets the
tone and directs the banksters with limitations and orders. The European Central Bank (ECB) is
setting the stage of a complete financial collapse of fiat currencies across
the globe.
Joining in the scheme are other technocratic institutions such as,
-
the Federal Reserve
-
the Bank of Canada
-
the Bank of England
-
the Bank of
Japan
-
the Swiss National Bank
Under the guise of preventing a system failure
during the global financial crisis, there will be,
an extension of the existing temporary US
dollar liquidity swap arrangements until February 1, 2014.
This action allows the central bankers to
liquidate currencies under their jurisdiction should market conditions so
warrant.
Under this plan, Euros backed by nothing can
continue to pour into the system throughout the Eurozone in addition to the
existing liquidity-providing operations in the US. This liquidation will
take place until further notice.
The
United
Nations has proposed a complete overhaul in the report
entitled, Adapting the International Monetary System to Face 21st Century
Challenges.
They call for a,
more intense debate on and reforms to the
international monetary system imply that the current system is unable to
respond appropriately and adequately to challenges that have appeared,
or become more acute, in recent years.
This paper focuses on four such challenges:
ensuring an orderly exit from global imbalances, facilitating more
complementary adjustments between surplus and deficit countries without
recessionary impacts, better supporting international trade by reducing
currency volatility and better providing development and climate
finance.
After describing them, it proposes reforms
to enable the international monetary system to better respond to these
challenges.
They recommend movement toward a global currency
that will replace all current currencies.
Revaluation will be accessed and the worth of
money would redistribute with oversight of the IMF, WTO and ultimately the
UN.
