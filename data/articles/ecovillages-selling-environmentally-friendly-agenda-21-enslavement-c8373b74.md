Ecovillages (EV) are being sold by eco-fascists
as,
an urban or rural community of people who
strive to integrate a supportive social environment with a low-impact
way of life.
The benefits are preservation of biodiversity,
low-impact to the environment and a divergence from modern cities that
facilitate depression, social divide, poverty and scarcity.
The Global
Ecovillage Network (GEN) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that
supports,
ecovillages, transition town initiatives,
intentional communities, and ecologically-minded individuals worldwide.
GEN focuses on promoting the evolution of sustainable settlements
across the world.
Through propaganda fed through,
communities,
businesses, media, educational institutions, governments, foundations,
writers, researchers, educators, students, and citizen activists,
...GEN is
able to network individuals, organizations and governments to implement
sustainable living.
Robert C. Gilman began researching
EV in the 1970s and founded GEN. Gilmans concerns were how humanity could
integrate into the natural world indefinitely to preserve the planet.
In June of this year, GEN will
host the Communal Pathways to Sustainable Living: Past, Present and
Future conference of the International Communal Studies Association (ICSA).
The conference will bridge academic research,
communal scholars and activists together to discuss how to coerce
populations across the globe to willingly choose,
ecovillages, cohousing, communes,
kibbutzim, sectarian communities and housing cooperatives.
The Findhorn
Foundation (FF) will be spot-lighted at the conference as the standard
achieved by near future generations. FF combines new-age spirituality,
holistic education and eco-fascist ideology to become the perfect experiment
in conscious living.
The EV movement is
defined as a
global phenomenon responding to global causes. This way of living is
viewed as how we must all live eventually.
The initiative focuses on 50-400 people existing
sustainably where there is no separation from work and home, fear and stress
are eliminated, and the Western lifestyle of consumption is perceived as
social injustice with regard to globalism.
Current global economic models are viewed as the
root cause of anti-environmentalism. Economists perceive the green
revolution as an economic miracle that can transform flawed economic ideals.
To feed the masses, vertical farms promise to
spare the environment from the nutrient depleting practice of agriculture,
while providing the ability to cultivate animal and/or plant life on
vertically lined surfaces - such as skyscrapers.
According to Gilbert Elis Bailey, the farmer
would do better to double the depth of his fertile land by redefining
agricultural practices.
Architect Ken Yang has conceptualized the use of
skyscrapers for climate control to produce mass plant life in an open-air
communal planting space. This idea engages the community to plant the food
that the community will later consume.
By building upwards the number of living
spaces and commerce centers can greatly expand for the benefit of the
community.
Humans are now being
compared to invasive species that commandeer territory, disburse
indigenous wildlife and destroy the planet in the process.
Sir David Attenborough recently stated in an
interview that humans are a plague on the Earth. Attenborough asserted the human over-population
has destroyed the natural world, caused climate change and food shortages.
As a supporter of Population
Matters (PM), Attenborough explains:
We keep putting on programs about famine in
Ethiopia; thats whats happening. Too many people there. They cant
support themselves - and its not an inhuman thing to say. Its the
case.
Until humanity manages to sort itself out and get a coordinated
view about the planet its going to get worse and worse.
PM extorts that having a sustainable global
population size is the first step to a good standard of living for all and
environmental sustainability where family planning and limiting access to
in-vitro fertilization will result in a world with less children.
Similarly, the
Population Institute (PI)
is an international non-profit that promotes universal access to family
planning information, education, and services which can assist in achieving
their goal of a world population in balance with a healthy global
environment and resource based economy.
PI receives financial support from foundation,
corporations and individuals to use depopulation propaganda to coerce
governments, elected officials, administrators, the media and the general
public to support activism against humanity.
Family planning efforts in the US have
manifested in
propaganda
studies produced by the American Academy of Pediatrics which suggests
using
Depo-Provera to stop young boys from reaching early puberty.
Marcia Herman-Giddens, lead author and adjunct
professor of maternal and child health for the University of North Carolina
School of Global Public Health,
says that this should have an impact on the public health community.
Per the research, Herman-Giddens claims that
environment is causing these fast changes in young males development.
Genetics take maybe hundreds, thousands of
years. You have to look at something in the environment. That would
include everything from (a lack of) exercise to junk food to TV to
chemicals.
Central Precocious Puberty (CPP) is
a new medical condition that coincides with studies like the one published
by Herman-Giddens.
CPP is defined as,
a condition where puberty starts too soon
in children - usually in girls under 8 years old and boys under 9 years
old.
When the brain of a child releases hormones from
the adrenal glands or pituitary gland too early, premature onset of
pubescent emergence is manifest which affects the central nervous system, as
well as the developing brain.
The goal of pharmaceutical treatments are to,
stop puberty from progressing.
One
medication used in the medical community to combat this occurrence is
Depo-Provera, which is a pharmaceutical form of sterilization for women.
This drug is a favorite of Melinda Gates of the
Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation because it enables
women to,
receive a shot behind [their]
husbands back.
The injectable Depo-Provera is being
sold to under-developed nations and being administered by healthcare
workers and nonmedical providers, or by the women themselves. Policy and
training systems are underway to ensure these drugs are utilized in areas
like the sub-Saharan Africa.
By using these areas as testing grounds for new
fertility drugs, as well as forcible sterilization schemes, the BMGF are
focusing on preventative situations over dealing with abortable pregnancies
which become complicated.
