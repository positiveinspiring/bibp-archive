A lot of people who hoped the election of Barak Obama meant "change" were
severely disappointed at his hiring of vast numbers of Clinton
administration retreads.
However, the Obama administration really does
represent "change;" only this change has taken place within the US secret
government, according to senior sources in the Japanese secret government.
What has happened is that
the Rothschild faction
that backed Al Gore and his
global warming lie has made an alliance with the
Rockefellers against the Bush
Skull and Bones/Knights Templar/Thule society
faction of satanists.
Another way of putting it is the followers of the
tradition of Abraham have taken a stance against the followers of the
tradition of Nimrod.
This should be good news for Americans and the rest of the world even though
many would prefer that there be no secret government at all. It means a
planned genocide has been stopped and instead we now have a real chance at
world peace and the beginning of an era of unprecedented prosperity.
When George Scherff (known to us as
George Bush Senior), the new Fuhrer,
took over the US in the 1980's, plans resurrect the Third Reich and carry
out Hitler's plan for genocide on an unprecedented scale began to be
implemented. These plans are well known to those of us who have escaped the
mind-slavery of the illuminati rulers.
The Nazis wanted to
reduce the world population
to as low as 500 million people and enslave the majority of the survivors in
order to ensure a "middle class lifestyle in harmony with nature" for the
mostly "Aryan" survivors. The plans included artificially created diseases,
starvation and a fake Armageddon known as
Project Bluebeam. This, the new
leading clique promises, has been cancelled.
The Obama regime will, however, retain many characteristics of the Nazi and
Japanese Imperial regimes along with a Roosevelt type approach. All of these
regimes ended the depression by means of massive public works. In the case
of Germany the original approach, such as building the Autobahn, was a boon
to the average German and Hitler became wildly popular until his crazy
vision drove Germany into a ruinous war. The Japanese case was similar. Only
Roosevelt tried massive development without a huge military build-up.
The general mobilization of all U.S. military veterans is designed to help
kick-start a similar campaign to get the US back on a fast growth track
after it goes bankrupt some time during the first half of next year. We can
see this from the fact Obama has already announced a massive public works
program as well as heavy investment in new energy technology.
In addition, Jay Rockefeller, the new head of
the Rockefeller clan (with uncle David still taking an active advisory role)
also plans a massive space development campaign designed to keep the
military industrial machine humming on a more peaceful note.
The more important point to remember is that global leadership is now in the
hands of the G-20:
The European Union is also a member, represented by the rotating
Council presidency and the European Central Bank. This group is implementing
an unprecedented campaign to change the direction this planet has been
moving in.
There are many details still to be worked out though. There is still no
agreement on what new currency or basket of currencies will replace the US
dollar. The new head honcho of the planet, China, has allied with Brazil,
Russia and India (BRIC) to push hard for a total change of global financial
architecture, including a new global currency.
The US is pushing to
replace the dollar with the Amero while the EU is still pushing for a stronger role for the Euro despite
the split between the financially weak UK and Mediterranean countries with
the more prudent Germany. It is looking likely Germany may well opt to join
with the BRICs, in which case the Euro and Amero will be doomed to become
regional currencies.
Japan, the world's largest creditor nation with a cash
pile of over $6 trillion, remains a passive observer for now but will
probably eventually join the BRICs once the Americans finally bow to the
inevitable.
There is also still a lot of bickering over things like the need for
population control and what to do about agricultural policy and the
environment.
The big question mark is what sort of "artificially generated crisis" we can
expect in January. My personal secret hope is that the G20 leaders will
carry out the world's biggest ever inside job and create a fake Armageddon
in order to prepare the people of the world psychologically for an entirely
new age (not the 230-year old "New" world order).
There is still a powerful faction that wants all out war in order to
preserve Anglo-European hegemony but they are unlikely to prevail this time.
Although the U.S. military industrial complex wants to upgrade the war in
Afghanistan, the fact that both Pakistan and the US are bankrupt means that
both sides of this artificially generated war means they cannot afford to
continue it.
The idea of a war against a big nation like China, which the militarist Nazi
faction is still pushing for, will also not work because all war planning
scenarios and war games show the result would be a disastrous defeat for the
US. The best case scenario for US war planners would be destruction of the
Northern hemisphere and that is not a tempting outcome to say the least.
No matter what, though, serious turbulence lies ahead as we witness the
ongoing death-throes of the Anglo-American financial system. However, there
can be no doubt a magnificent phoenix will arise from the ashes of the now
defunct 230-year old "new world order."
These are truly historical times.
