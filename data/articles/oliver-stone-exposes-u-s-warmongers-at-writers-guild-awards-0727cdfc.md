Last week, the Ron Paul Liberty Report interviewed the legendary filmmaker, Oliver Stone.
After the interview, the report drew attention to a powerful speech by Stone, given at this year's Writers Guild Awards.
The speech was conveniently overlooked by the mainstream media as it shatters the divisive two-party paradigm and exposes the 'system' for the warmongering, rights-violating behemoth that it is. Stone is an American screenwriter, film director, and producer. Stone won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay as the writer of Midnight Express.
He also wrote the acclaimed gangster movie Scarface. Stone, unlike many of the puppets in Hollywood, has used his fame to shed light on and expose the powers that be. During his time at the podium at the awards, Stone reminded the young writers that it is okay to question both parties.
Stone noted the importance of not buying into the divisive tactics of the establishment.
"You don't have to fit in," Stone said before showing how it is "fashionable now to take shots at Republicans and Trump, and avoid the Obamas and Clintons." "But remember that," Stone said, "in the 13 wars we've started over the last 30 years and the 14 billion dollars we've spent, and the hundreds of thousands of lives that have perished from this Earth, remember that it wasn't one leader, but a system, both Republican and Democrat." "Call it what you will, the military, industrial, security, money, media complex. It's a system that has been perpetuated under the guise that these are just wars justifiable in the name of our flag we fly so proudly over our lives," Stone said.

It's a system that has been perpetuated under the guise that these are just wars justifiable in the name of our flag we fly so proudly over our lives," Stone said.
Hearing these words come from such a prominent figure in Hollywood as well as the rest of the world is heartening, to say the least.
"Our country has become prosperous for many. But in the name of that wealth we cannot justify our system as a center for the world's values, while we continue to create such wars and chaos in the world." "No need to go through the victims," he said, "but we know we've intervened in more than 100 countries, with invasions, regime change, economic chaos, or hybrid war - soft power - whatever you want to call it, it's war of some kind," Stone told the audience.

He concluded with advice based on his own experiences.
"I've fought these people who practice war for most of my life. It's a tiring game. And mostly you'll get your ass kicked. With all the criticism and insults you'll receive, and the flattery too, it's important to remember, if you believe in what you're saying and you can stay the course, you can make a difference," he said. "I urge you to find a way to remain alone with yourself, listen to your silences, not always in a writer's room. Try to find not what the crowd wants so you can be successful, but try instead to find the true inner meaning of your life here on earth, and never give up on your heart in your struggle for peace, decency, and telling the truth."
