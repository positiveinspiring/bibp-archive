The
Federal Reserve Bank (FED)
announced that the richest of Americans have become even wealthier over
the last 3 years which has further widened the gap between rich and poor in
the nation (see 'Changes
in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013 - Evidence from the Survey of
Consumer Finances').
Even after incomes were "adjusted" because of
FED imposed inflation; it was still obvious that "the top 10%" of incomes
rose by 2% which is reflected in a $6,000 increase. This is juxtaposed by
the "median income" which fell 4% "for the bottom 20%" translating to a $600
difference.
In addition, middle incomes dropped 6% from
$51,800 to $48,700.
The FED report
shows :
-
The top 10% own more than 70% of
everything
-
White families are worth $679,000
-
White Americans own "extremely
disproportionate amount of the national wealth"
-
White Americans have 90% of the national
wealth
-
The top 10% wealthy white families own
65.1% of national wealth
As shown in a 2012 audit of the
audit of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) published by the
Government Accountability Office (GAO), Senator
Bernie Sanders commented:
"As a result of this audit, we now know that
the Federal Reserve provided more than $16 trillion in total financial
assistance to some of the largest financial institutions and
corporations in the United States and throughout the world.
This is a clear case of socialism for the
rich and rugged, youre-on-your-own individualism for everyone else."
During 2007-2010, the Federal Reserve banks
provided "assistance" of more than a trillion dollars in "emergency loans"
to stabilize the financial system. To stave this off, the American taxpayers were
coerced by former President
Bush and former US Treasury Secretary Hank
Paulson.
During that incident, the US Senate was told
emphatically that they had to approve a $700 billion bailout or else
martial law would be implemented immediately
(below video):
That money was
funneled through the Federal Reserve Bank and wired to China, as well as
other countries that were demanding repayment for the fraudulent
securitizations.
To further avert financial catastrophe, as well
as more debt or property seizure threats by the Chinese, the Euro was
imploded there by plunging most of the European countries into an
insurmountable free-fall for which they were never intended to recover.
All the money that those banks claimed they
needed to avert collapse was also sent to the Chinese to add to the
trillions of dollars lost during the burst of the housing bubble on the
global market.
The GAO audit states that this transfer of funds
from the FRBNY to the central Bank of China was an "unusual and exigent
circumstance" that warranted the "emergency authority" of the FRBNY.
Under the guise of "emergency loans" waivers of
banking employees and private contractors were given kickbacks.
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and member of the board of
directors of the FRBNY, was given an estimated $390 billion in "aid" from
the FRBNY.
In kind, JPMorgan Chase was used as a money
laundering institution during the mortgage-backed securities and derivatives
scandal. Earlier this year, Oxfam released
a report stating that 85 people in the world hold and control the same
amount of the wealth as half of the worlds population.
The report findings include breakdowns of how
this wealth is unequally distributed:
-
Globally, the richest individuals and
companies hide trillions of dollars away from the tax man in a web
of tax havens around the world. It is estimated that $21 trillion is
held unrecorded and off-shore
-
In the US, years of financial
deregulation directly correlates to the increase in the income share
of the top one per cent which is now at its highest level since the
eve of the Great Depression
-
In India, the number of billionaires
increased tenfold in the past decade, aided by a highly regressive
tax structure and the wealthy exploiting their government
connections, while spending on the poorest remains remarkably low;
-
In Europe, austerity has been imposed on
the poor and middle classes under huge pressure from financial
markets whose wealthy investors have benefited from state bailouts
of financial institutions
-
In Africa, global corporations - particularly those in extractive industries
- exploit their
influence to avoid taxes and royalties, reducing the resources
available to governments to fight poverty
Oxfam expressed their,
"concerned that, left unchecked, the effects
are potentially immutable, and will lead to opportunity capture - in
which the lowest tax rates, the best education, and the best healthcare
are claimed by the children of the rich.
This creates dynamic and mutually
reinforcing cycles of advantage that are transmitted across
generations."
This translates to the 3.55 billion poor people
must live on what only 85 people possess monetarily. In other words those 85
richest people in the world have access to the same amount of resources as
42 million poor people on a global scale.
And just for measure, 42 million people equal
roughly the populations of Canada combined with the populations of the
states of Kentucky and Kansas.
