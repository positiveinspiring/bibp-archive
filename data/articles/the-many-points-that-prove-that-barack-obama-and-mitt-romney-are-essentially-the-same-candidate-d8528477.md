What a depressing choice the American people are
being presented with this year.
We are at a point in our history where we
desperately need a change of direction in the White House, and we are
guaranteed that we are not going to get it. The Democrats are running the
worst president in American history, and the Republicans are running a guy
who is almost a carbon copy of him.
The fact that about half the country is still
supporting Barack Obama shows how incredibly stupid and corrupt the
American people have become. No American should have ever cast a single vote
for Barack Obama for any political office under any circumstances. He should
never have even been the assistant superintendent in charge of janitorial
supplies, much less the president of the United States.
The truth is that
Barack
Obama has done such a horrible job that he should immediately
resign along with his entire cabinet.
But instead of giving us a clear choice, the
Republicans nominated the Republican that was running that was most similar
to Barack Obama. In fact, I don't think we have ever had two candidates for
president that are so similar.
Yes, there are a few minor differences between
them, but the truth is that we are heading into Obama's second term no
matter which one of them gets elected.
The mainstream media makes it sound like
Obama and Romney are bitter ideological rivals but that is a giant
lie. Yeah, they are slinging lots of mud at each other, but they both
play for the same team and the losers are going to be the American people.
Republicans are being told that they have "no
choice" but to vote for Romney because otherwise they will get
another four years of Obama.
This "lesser of two evils" theme comes out every
four years.
We are told that we "must" vote for a horrible
candidate because the other guy is even worse. Well, millions of Americans
are getting sick of this routine. Perhaps that is why it is being projected
that as many as
90 million Americans of voting age will not
vote this year.
Yes, Barack Obama has been so horrible as
president that it is hard to put it into words. But Mitt Romney
would be just like Barack Obama. Those that are dreaming of a major
change in direction if Romney is elected are going to be bitterly, bitterly
disappointed.
