U. S. Space Command
Space War Headquarters for operating "the next war, which will be fought
in space", Falcon AFB, Colorado. Not if we have anything to say about it
it won't. This is what they are gearing up to do with the Star Wars program.
According to Claude Manor, a Kennedy Assassination researcher for 34 years,
President Kennedy wanted a Joint Mission to the moon with the Soviet Union
to help ease Cold War tensions. However, Mr. Manor stated, NASA and the military
completely disagreed with him. They felt that whomever got to space first
and learned to live there could control the world.
Who should control space? The democratically elected leader of the nation,
not the military or NASA which is part of the Shadow Government. The space
program would benefit mankind but the war which will ensue if the people
don't come together to control the "selected" "leader" who sits in
the White House now will destroy mankind.
Many people believe that there are extraterrestrials. They would suffer
immeasurably if they were attacked just as the Vietnamese and so many others
have suffered so we must prevent this atrocity. The elite don't need to make
money from atrocities in space.
