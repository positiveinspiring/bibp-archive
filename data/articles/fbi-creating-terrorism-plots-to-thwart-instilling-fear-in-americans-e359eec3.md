Last Wednesday, a 21-year-old Bangladeshi
national, Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, was arrested and accused of
traveling to the U.S. to establish an al Qaeda cell and bomb the Federal
Reserve Bank in Lower Manhattan.
Buried beneath the headlines and opening
paragraphs of the major news outlet reports, however, is the fact that Nafis
would have been unable to execute his plot without substantial assistance
from the F.B.I.
Authorities assured several news agencies that the public
was never in danger.
This case is yet another instance, among
hundreds, of federal agencies creating terrorist plots so they can take
credit for stopping them, instill fear in Americans and justify the billions
of taxpayer dollars spent on wars and homeland security.
This practice
earned the number four rank on the list of the
2012 Project Censored most underreported stories in the U.S. media.
Last year, Trevor Aronson, with the aid of the
Investigative Reporting Program at University of California-Berkley,
completed a
yearlong investigation of
every case of terrorism that the Department of Justice (D.O.J.)
prosecuted since 9/11 that was published in
Mother Jones monthly.
Out of
508 defendants at the time, 248 were targeted via an informant, 158 were
nabbed via a sting operation, and 49 were lured via an informant who led the
plot. Only three cases did not involve an informant and/or a F.B.I. sting
operation.
In 53 percent of the cases, the charges the defendants were
convicted of did not involve
terrorism.
One former high-level F.B.I. official speaking
to Mother Jones said that, for every informant officially employed
by the bureau, up to three unofficial agents are working undercover.
There
are upwards of 15,000 undercover agents today, ten times what the F.B.I. had
on the roster back in 1975, earning as much as $100,000 per assignment.
According to the New York Times,
both F.B.I. leaders and federal prosecutors have defended the approach
as valuable in finding and stopping people predisposed to commit terrorism.
There are doubts, however, as to whether these individuals would have had
the will or capability to act on their own without being led along by F.B.I.
informants.
While this practice is legal under legislation
passed since 9/11, its legitimacy is questionable. In many cases it is
borderline entrapment under the strict legal definition, but defense
attorneys have had difficulty making that argument because important
meetings between informants and the unknowing participants are left
purposely unrecorded in order to avoid any entrapment charges that could
cause the case to be dismissed.
At issue is the word "entrapment", which has two
definitions.
There is the common usage, where a citizen might see F.B.I.
operations as deliberate traps manipulating unwary people who otherwise were
unlikely to become terrorists. Then there is the legal definition of
entrapment, where the prosecution merely has to show a subject was
predisposed to carry out the actions they later are accused of.
In the most recent case of the Federal Reserve
bomb plot, Nafis was charged with conspiring to use weapons of mass
destruction and providing material support to al Qaeda. According to the
criminal complaint, he initially spoke of a desire to kill a high-ranking
government official and tried to make contacts in order to recruit a
terrorist cell.
A senior
law enforcement official told the New York Times that the
official was President
Obama, but that Nafiss desire never got past the
talking stage. F.B.I. agents posing as al Qaeda contacts provided him with
encouragement and guidance, redirecting him to the bombing idea and
providing him with the material means to carry out the plot.
This case reveals several issues.
-
Firstly, Nafis
was never in contact with any real terrorists. If terrorists are scattered
all about the country in cells, why was he unable to contact a single one of
them?
-
Secondly, he was never able to procure any real explosives.
-
Thirdly,
if he came in contact with F.B.I. agents, that means he was blindly
recruiting anyone for his terrorist cell. He even
asked a contact over Facebook, an F.B.I. informant, if it was
permissible to blow up a country that granted him a student visa.
What real
terrorist would be na√Øve enough to do that?
This case makes Nafis sound more like a loner
with wild ideas that was led along by the F.B.I. rather than a real
terrorist. It also sounds like hundreds of other cases. In fact, some of the
most highly publicized terrorist plots since 9/11 were thwarted under
similar circumstances.
In 2009, several men, urged by an unusually
persistent government informer,
planted what they believed to be homemade bombs in front of synagogues
in NYC.
Four men were convicted, but the judge who oversaw the trial also
criticized the law enforcement agents who helped push the plot forward:
The
government made them terrorists.
In the case of the infamous underwear bomber on
Christmas Day 2009, a Detroit lawyer, Kurt Haskell, was on the plane and
called as a witness in the trial of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.
Haskell
maintains that Abdulmutallab was carrying a fake bomb and was the unwitting
dupe in a case of government entrapment.
Haskell also witnessed a
well-dressed man help Abdulmutallab clear security before the incident,
despite the fact that the bomber had no passport and that U.S. intelligence
officials were warned by his own father of the threat posed by him a month
before the attempted attack.
In the case of the
Cleveland bridge bombers last May, the plot was hatched at an Occupy
Cleveland protest last October by an F.B.I. informant who persuaded the
defendants to blow up a large bridge.
He led them to another F.B.I. agent
posing as a merchant who charged them $450 for a fake bomb.
One of the Cleveland arrestees, Connor Stevens,
complained to his sister of feeling "very pressured" by the guy who turned
out to be an informant and was recorded in 2011 rejecting property
destruction:
"We're in it for the long haul and those
kind of tactics just don't cut it," he said. "And it's actually harder
to be non-violent than it is to do stuff like that."
The case of the
Fort Dix Five, accused of plotting to attack a New Jersey army base,
also involved dubious use of paid informants, an apparent over-reach of
evidence and a plot that seemed suggested by the government.
Burim Duka, whose three brothers were jailed for
life for their part in the scheme, insists they did not know they were part
of a terror plot and were just buying guns for shooting holidays in a deal
arranged by a friend.
The "friend" was an informant who had persuaded
another man of a desire to attack Fort Dix.
These are just five of the more high profile
cases out of hundreds of others in which a seemingly dangerous terrorist
plot is thwarted, only to have the facts later reveal that the terrorists
could not terrorize a fly without the tutelage and material aid of federal
law enforcement agencies and informants.
These cases make it clear that the U.S.
government is creating terrorism in order to be perceived as thwarting it
and scaring the American people into believing there are real terrorists in
our country.
The motive behind that may be to justify legislation that
infringes on
civil liberties, huge expenditures on homeland security such as the
Transportation Security Administration, surveillance conducted by
fusion centers and wars that generate profit for the military-industrial
complex.
Of course, the most recent case will enable the Federal Reserve to
claim it is a terrorist target and request additional security.
Federal law enforcement agencies seem to take an
affirmative role in staging the crimes at mosques or, as in the case of the
Cleveland bridge bombers, at an occupy protest. When the D.O.J. prosecutes
cases like these, it leaves more clear-and-present dangers, such as
criminals like the Foot Hood shooter, the Arizona shooter who shot a
congresswoman, the Colorado movie theatre shooter or the Sikh temple shooter
in Wisconsin, relatively unbothered and discovered only after people are
killed.
Perhaps the government is singling out
ideological enemies, not real terrorism or
crime.
The American people simply have no legitimate reason to believe anything
that the corporate media or government claims, especially when it has to do
with terrorism which has historically been used to further restrict the
freedoms of everyday Americans nationwide.
That is consistent with several of the
14 defining characteristics of fascism that have become apparent in the
U.S. in 2012.
Update
Today a
gunman shot seven people in a Milwaukee-area mall, three of whom died.
He then took his own life. Yet another example that the FBI is not
stopping those that are really "predisposed to commit terrorism."
