Its said,
"Illusion must first be destroyed, in order
to build a firm foundation of truth."
The learned definition of freedom is all
important.
What Americans consider their proud foundation
of liberty is
a Freemasonic ploy set up to fail, with
enough perks, freedoms and stimulants to keep them producing like a house a
fire for over 200 years.
Empowering dynamics soon kicked in including many oblivious people doing
what they thought was best. But still, its been a nation under a massive
delusion.
Just look at the violent history of that country. Born and bred in war
after war as if its a virtue to be proud of. Its a young, two century
old war machine dutifully feeding off the people and resources of the world
for directed reasons it knows not of. A very serious weapon indeed. With no
awareness of their true mission.
Sure, Americans have (had) homes and plenty of
Ozzie and Harriet promises of
middle class heaven while the plan marched on. But they were duped. They
were all duped.
And facing that, is the beginning
of awareness.
War, Wars and More Wars
Just count the current
military installations the US now has. Its
almost beyond comprehension.
Their military presence is in over 1000
locations worldwide and counting, so-called "policing" the world. How this
happened over time is yet another indictment against the sleeping American,
sad to say.
This one apparent fact is damning enough.
Here is just ONE part of the world they are "protecting for democracy."
Why..
Domination, of course.
The ship is being steered
by psychopaths and theyll use anything and
anybody to get their way. Amerika is clearly an extension of the same
self-righteous fascist control mechanism used over centuries, from
Babylon to
Egypt to
Rome and on into Europe.
The staged German WW2 event only set the current
Amerikan world takeover stage, with the so-called "freedom loving" west
decrying such past "fascist" activities while at the same time continuing
them under new astronomically insidious guises.
This gets into the historical records but this is all clear to any open
minded researcher. That wars are staged and financed on both sides is a
mainstay realization when you truly delve into the facts behind wars. The
slaughter of millions of innocents is merely part of the play for these
vicious, vampiric types.
We are simply fodder in their plans.
Amerika has simply been a holding tank of willing accomplices, ready to
defend the pretend freedoms they were sold from the get go. Oh, they were
real in their own context, and still are to a limited extent, but all within
a carefully contained, ready-to-be demolished construct.
Much
like 9/11. Very much...
The country is now
being imploded now that its served its purpose. Even their very false
symbol of freedom must be destroyed.
Obviously not all Amerikans are accomplices. But those who
ride along in a military truck they
themselves keep repairing and bolstering, while it wantonly annihilates
anything in its path, are not just bystanders. Sorry.
Americans self-righteously hold other
nationalities in account for supporting fascist, oppressive regimes.
Its time to hold up the mirror.
The Military
Industrial Death Culture
Death, domination and destruction are the MO (modus
operandi) of the
powers that be.
To control and manipulate efficiently they need
continual wars with,
Their type of exploitative freedom of course.
With the backing of a duped populace.
-
Its worked time and again. And its
alive and well in todays totalitarian takeover. Total control at
any cost.
-
Its a strikingly frank look at the US
and its complicit allies, with many like the UK and Israel goading
them on.
In fact, much of true Amerikan leadership comes
from places like,
This is all done in concert to the dancing tune
of a
One World Organism, a controlling body
that will dissolve any and all sensibilities of sovereignty or cultural
definitions.
Hence the engineered, concurrent social breakdown to prepare the way.
Thats been the plan all along. Families dissolve, governments and
institutions of all types socialize into centralized authorities, while any
substantive differences are mixed into a morass of non-individuality.
Such is the current state of affairs.
Conclusion
This is a very brief treatise on a huge subject, but Amerika must continue
to be called out.
The presumed good guy is the bad guy.
Everything is backwards. The terrorists are the invading armies.
The US and Israel and their axis of complicit allies are the epitome of
this. Country after country is falling into complete chaos and disrepair in
the name of liberation.
When will the insanity not just be stopped, but called out for what it
clearly is?
I rest my case...
