Man hasnt been back to the moon since 1972, but that hasnt stopped a team of Japanese engineers from developing a plan to turn our celestial neighbor into a massive solar power plant.
The disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power station has made Japan think more seriously about alternative energy, and as a result Shimizu Corporations crazy plan has been gaining traction. The plan calls for a massive 12 mile-wide, 6,800 mile long "Luna Ring" of solar panels to be constructed on the moons surface.
The solar belt would then harness solar power directly from the sun and then beam it straight to Earth via microwaves and lasers.
Shimizu Corporations plan would see 13,000 terawatts of continuous energy sent to receiving stations around the Earth, where it will be then distributed to the planets population.
With NASAs plans to return the moon currently on hold, Shimizu is planning on building the massive lunar construction project with robots. In fact, humans will barely be involved and will only be present in an overseeing capacity.
In a statement, the company said,
"A shift from economical use of limited resources to the unlimited use of clean energy is the ultimate dream of all mankind. The Luna Ring, our lunar solar power generation concept, translates this dream into reality through ingenious ideas coupled with advanced space technologies. "Virtually inexhaustible, non-polluting solar energy is the ultimate source of green energy that brings prosperity to nature as well as our lives. Shimizu Corporation proposes the Luna Ring for the infinite coexistence of mankind and the Earth."

While it is an excellent idea, echoing a similar energy concept in the film Moon, the plan is simply unfeasible.
Seeing as we cant get robots to drive our cars yet, how can we expect them to build an entire solar farm on the moon?
