Connecting The Dots
Afghan Heroin, NATO, Azerbaijan Hub and
Cargo Business
Azerbaijan in
Operation Gladio-Plan B
Over the last few weeks
James Corbett and I have been discussing US-NATO Gladio Operations in the
Islamization and Terrorization of Central Asia- Caucasus, and the real lords
of the booming Afghan heroin business.
If
you havent already, watch our video interview series:
Part 1,
Part 2,
Part 3,
Part 4
and
Part 5.
During our interview series
I have been emphasizing history and context as the two most important
prerequisites in understanding the current developments in the region, and
of course, in connecting the dots that lay in plain sight.
I have also talked about our
weeknight news roundup that highlights these dots.
Today, as I was
researching and preparing our nightly news roundup, I extracted several such
dots that directly relate to our Gladio reports. For those of you who have
been following our recent coverage the following dots (not covered by the
mainstream media; but of course!) will be highly interesting and
ultra-revealing.
Are you ready? Okay, then,
lets lay out the recent dots from our coming news coverage this evening,
put that together with all that has been already revealed and discussed,
and see how easy it is to understand the real happenings and their
significance in light of what we know.
During our Gladio interviews
we discussed the Afghan heroin business as one of Turkeys major roles in
the Gladio Operations under the United States and NATO.
We also discussed how major
aspects of heroin operations were moved from Turkey to Azerbaijan-both in
terms of labs and transit, after 1997, and intensified after Azerbaijans
addition to NATO.
Lets use a
report
from a couple of years ago to highlight what we covered during our Gladio
series:
Azerbaijan is a major transit link of trafficking in
heroin and other drugs transported from Afghanistan to Europe, a UN body
claims.
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime says the so-called
northern Balkan route, a relatively recent variant on the Balkan route
which transits the Caucasus rather than Turkey, crosses Azerbaijan.
Heroin crosses from the Azerbaijan-e-Khavari province of
Iran into Turkey and traverses Turkeys Hakkari and/or Van districts.
An estimated 95 mt of heroin are shipped across Turkeys
borders every year, says the UN report, adding that Bulgaria is a link
in one of those routes: Hakkari/Van - south-eastern cities - central
Anatolian cities - Istanbul - Edirne to Bulgaria/Greece.
All right, we have several
past mainstream official reports and our Gladio interview series on
Azerbaijans major role in the booming Afghan heroin business.
Now, the following
report-article
came out today:
Azerbaijan is significant transit
country for illicit drug trafficking, and through its territory 11 tons
of heroin transfer
Azerbaijan is a significant transit country for heroin
and other narcotics, as it is situated along major drug trafficking
routes from Afghanistan and Iran to Europe and Russia, the annual report
of the US State Department on 2013 International Narcotics Control
Strategy (INCSR) says.
In the previous report of the State Department was
mentioned that Azerbaijan is a transit country for transporting drugs
from Afghanistan, Central Asia and Iran to Russia and Europe.
Please stay with me since
this fact about Azerbaijan has been known for a while and is not too
significant by itself.
Also, keep in mind,
Turkey-Azerbaijan-Bulgaria happen to be major NATO fields of operations. In
fact, when the importance of the Balkans as the major transit hub since the
late 1990s is emphasized, I want you to think about our NATO wars and
operations to break up and take over the region - ending in mid to late
1990s - the beginning of the formation of the Balkan hub as a major
transit hub. Okay?
Next, another significant
related news
item from today:
U.S. Praises Azerbaijans Role in Cargo
Transportation to Afghanistan
The United States highly appreciate the role of
Azerbaijan in the international efforts for provision of security in
Afghanistan.
According to AzerTAj, the statement came from commander
of the Transport Command of the United States, general William Freizer
speaking at the hearings in the US Congress, 1news.az reports.
He said the successful direct transportation of cargo via
the airspace of Azerbaijan represent special importance in this context.
Earlier Azerbaijani Deputy FM Araz Azimov announced that
Azerbaijan is a transit on the way of cargo transportation to
Afghanistan and our country provides different services within the
framework of ISAF operation held by NATO
According to him, these cargoes will return from
Afghanistan to Europe and other countries via Azerbaijan.
Without being insulting, and
for those with insufficient consumption levels of
Omega-3
Fatty Acids
needed by our brains, lets add up the dots to this point:
-
After the US
invasion of Afghanistan and under US-NATO control heroin production
and sales boom
-
Azerbaijan has
become one of the most strategically important heroin transit hubs
since the beginning of Gladio Operation B, and since it has joined
and come under NATO
-
Just like Turkey,
nations with airfields under US command, such as Kyrgyzstans Manas
Airbase and Azerbaijans NATO Air Fields, have become the most
important transit-Transportation hubs for heroin
Now you see the significance
of the two related news reports above? Afghan Heroin, NATO Operations
Fields, Heroin Transit Hubs, and the CARGO business? Are you having a Duh
moment? Good!
Again, please recall my
discussion of the Balkans, especially Albania, from our Gladio series.
Pair that thought with
US-NATO Balkan operations, and then take a look at another related
news item
today:
Balkans main route for drugs from
Afghanistan
In a meeting with members of the regional program for
Southeast Europe, he noted that around 60 tons of heroin, worth USD 13
billion, have reached Western and Central Europe via the Balkan route,
said a release on the UNODC website.
The program, established last year at the request of
regional governments, is aimed at suppressing drug trafficking through
the Balkans and combating transnational organized crime, corruption and
money laundering. Fedotov warns that trafficking in narcotics could have
a destabilizing effect on the regions economy and social development.
According to the UNODC chief, the program has already
been very effective. Albania and Montenegro have launched a program of
control of shipping containers and Albania has set up a control unit in
the port of Durres.
Montenegro has drafted a new anti-drug strategy and a new
anti-terrorism action plan, and carried out training for the treatment
of drug addicts.
Well, this is what I was
referring to in the Gladio Video Series: Know the history, understand the
bigger context, and then watch or read the news, and youll have tons of
dots being connected before your own eyes.
