# Psychopaths - The Perfect Academic Word for U.S. Political, Economic 
"Leadership"

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_ponerologypsycho08.htm

Psychopaths are viciously
destructive in action.
They obfuscate with lies and charm. They
persist only when their actions are unrecognized; 95% of the population
reject such criminal destruction (here
and
here).
U.S. political and economic "leadership" are
psychopaths because their central policies are viciously destructive, as
the following links explain, document, and prove. "Leadership" obfuscate
with lies, charm, and
U.S. corporate media complicity.
Calling this behavior psychopathic is
perfect because it neither understates nor overstates the facts. Use
this academic term at your command.
I also suggest Princeton professor
Frankfurts academic term for the type of lies that "leadership" uses:
bullshit.
"As I grow older, I pay less attention
to what men say. I just watch what they do."

attributed to Andrew Carnegie
The destruction of millions of lives and
trillions of dollars will end when enough Americans recognize and assert
the "emperor has no clothes" facts:
-
Congressional reports disclose that
all "reasons" for war with Afghanistan and Iraq
were known to be lies as they were told.
-
Orwellian
unlawful wars, including using
depleted uranium weapons to damn victims with continuous
misery and death.
-
Obfuscating from the
obvious answer of ending an Orwellian "debt supply" and
replacing it with money.
-
Allowing a million children a month
to die of preventable poverty, even though historically
ending poverty reduces population growth rate and the
investment is less than 1% of the developed nations' gross
national incomes (GNI).
-
Torture,
extrajudicial assassinations (including
against American citizens) and
indefinite detentions.
-
Destruction of the U.S. Constitution
into a form of government
closest to fascism and nowhere near a constitutional
republic.
-
Literally throwing Americans onto
the streets rather than take
any of a dozen acts to allow them to stay in their homes.
-
Intentional unemployment, crime,
infrastructure decay, fear, anger, depression (both economic and
psychological)
rather than create money for full employment.
-
Allowing
45,000 Americans to die every year from lack of health care,
even though universal single-payer saves the nation $100-$300
billion every year.
The good news is that every step
"leadership" takes down their path of deceit and destruction, they
become easier to see for what they are.
We will win with critical mass
of public recognition of whats right in front of everyone to see (and
smell).
You, citizen, have unique opportunity to
contribute your unique, beautiful, and powerful self-expression to
building a brighter future if you choose the intellectual integrity and
moral courage to do so.
Please do.
Millions will live or die, billions will
have a life worth living or misery, and trillions of dollars of power
are directed at our collective choice.
