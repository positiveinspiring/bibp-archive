"Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it." Woodrow Wilson American academic, politician and the 28th president of the United States (source)

What are politics today, and how do they relate to what's happening on the planet?
On the surface, it seems to be nothing more than the political leaders' of one country using their media outlets to bash' the political leaders' of another country.
A great example right now is the ongoing situation between the United States and Russia. Here in Canada, newly elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently called Putin, Russia's President since May of 2012, a bully, and the United States did the same.
Below is what Putin had to say after Russia was accused of being a bully:
Putin Crushes BBC Smartass Source VLADIMIR PUTIN: Thank you very much for your question. About our exercises, maneuvers and the development of our armed forces. You said that Russia, to a certain extent, contributed to the tension that we are now seeing in the world. Russia did contribute but only insofar as it is more and more firmly protecting its national interests. We are not attacking in the political sense of the word. We are not attacking anyone. We are only protecting our interests. Our Western partners - and especially our US partners - are displeased with us for doing exactly that, not because we are allowing security-related activity that provokes tension. Let me explain. You are talking about our aircraft, including strategic aviation operations. Do you know that in the early 1990s, Russia completely stopped strategic aviation flights in remote surveillance areas as the Soviet Union previously did? We completely stopped, while flights of US strategic aircraft carrying nuclear weapons continued. Why? Against whom? Who was threatened? So we didn't make flights for many years and only a couple of years ago we resumed them. So are we really the ones doing the provoking? So, in fact, we only have two bases outside Russia, and both are in areas where terrorist activity is high. One is in Kyrgyzstan, and was deployed there upon request of the Kyrgyz authorities, President Akayev, after it was raided by Afghan militants. The other is in Tajikistan, which also borders on Afghanistan. I would guess you are interested in peace and stability there too. Our presence is justified and clearly understandable. Now, US bases are scattered around the globe, ...and you're telling me Russia is behaving aggressively? Do you have any common sense at all? What are US armed forces doing in Europe, also with tactical nuclear weapons? What are they doing there? Listen, Russia has increased its military spending for 2015, if I am not mistaken, it is around 50 billion in dollar equivalent. The Pentagon's budget is ten times that amount, $575 billion, I think, recently approved by the Congress. And you're telling me we are pursuing an aggressive policy? Is there any common sense in this? Are we moving our forces to the borders of the United States or other countries? Who is moving NATO bases and other military infrastructure towards us? We aren't. Is anyone listening to us? Is anyone engaging in some dialogue with us about it? No. No dialogue at all. All we hear is, "that's none of your business. Every country has the right to choose its way to ensure its own security." All right, but we have the right to do so too. Why can't we? Finally, the ABM system - something I mentioned in my Address to the Federal Assembly. Who was it that withdrew unilaterally from the ABM Treaty, one of the cornerstones of the global security system? Was it Russia? No, it wasn't. The United States did this, unilaterally. They are creating threats for us, they are deploying their strategic missile defence components not just in Alaska, but in Europe as well - in Romania and Poland, very close to us. And you're telling me we are pursuing an aggressive policy...? If the question is whether we want law-based relations, the answer is yes, but only if our national economic and security interests are absolutely respected. We negotiated WTO accession for 19 years or so, and consented to compromise on many issues, assuming that we are concluding cast-iron agreements. And then I will not discuss who's right and who's wrong (I already said on many occasions that I believe Russia behaved the right way in the Ukrainian crisis, and the West was wrong, but let us put this aside for now). Still, we joined the WTO. That organization has rules. And yet, sanctions were imposed on Russia in violation of the WTO rules, the international law and the UN Charter - again unilaterally and illegitimately. Are we in the 'wrong' again? We want to develop normal relations in the security sphere, in fighting terrorism. We will work together on nuclear non-proliferation. We will work together on other threats, including drugs, organized crime and grave infections, such as Ebola. We will do all this jointly, and we will cooperate in the economic sphere, if our partners want this.

On the other side of the pond, you have millions of people listening to Russian and Chinese media outlets saying something completely different.
Apart from mass propaganda that's dished out to us regarding political issues via the mainstream media, where are we to turn to get more information on this subject when global media outlets are basically supporting the interests of their own country?
On some issues it seems a little clearer, for example,
What is the United States doing with regards to their infiltration of so many countries across the world? Why have they established so many military bases? What is going on here?
What is the United States doing with regards to their infiltration of so many countries across the world?
Why have they established so many military bases?
What is going on here?
That being said, are these matters really in the hands of these politicians, or are they governed by a hidden hand that's rocking the cradle mixed with corporate influence?
A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many, and various, and powerful interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks. John C. Calhoun was the 7th Vice President of the United States (source)

Is there a hidden hand that is controlling countries like Canada, the United States and Israel (to name a few) that is run by an international group of people who are using their politics to establish a New World Order?
I believe this hidden hand is and has been bullying other countries and using deceptive means to accomplish their goals, and I am obviously not alone in my thoughts.
Recently, a number of politicians and academics gathered at the International Conference on the New World Order to discuss matters that are in light with the quote below from one of the speakers:
"We are dealing with a criminal undertaking at a global level and there is an ongoing war, it is led by the United States, it may be carried out by a number of proxy countries, which are obeying orders from Washington The global war on terrorism is a US undertaking, which is fake, it's based on fake premises. It tells us that somehow America and the Western world are going after a fictitious enemy, the Islamic state, when in fact the Islamic state is fully supported and financed by the Western military alliance and America's allies in the Persian Gulf They say Muslims are terrorists, but it just so happens that terrorists are made in America. They're not the product of Muslim society, and that should be abundantly clear to everyone on this floor The global war on terrorism is a fabrication, a big lie and a crime against humanity."
