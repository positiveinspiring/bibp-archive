# Europe's Five "Undeclared Nuclear Weapons States" - Are Turkey, Germany, 
Belgium, The Netherlands and Italy Nuclear Powers?

Israel - "Undeclared Nuclear State"
Israel is identified as an
"undeclared nuclear state". It produces and deploys nuclear warheads
directed against military and civilian targets in the Middle East
including Tehran.
Iran
There has been much hype,
supported by scanty evidence, that Iran might at some future date become
a nuclear weapons state. And, therefore, a pre-emptive defensive nuclear
attack on Iran to annihilate its non-existent nuclear weapons program
should be seriously contemplated "to make the World a safer place". The
mainstream media abounds with makeshift opinion on the Iran nuclear
threat.
But what about the five European "undeclared nuclear states" including
Belgium, Germany, Turkey, the Netherlands and Italy. Do they constitute
a threat?
Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy
and Turkey - "Undeclared Nuclear Weapons States"
While Iran's nuclear weapons
capabilities are unconfirmed, the nuclear weapons capabilities of these
five countries including delivery procedures are formally acknowledged.
The US has supplied some 480 B61 thermonuclear bombs to five so-called
"non-nuclear states", including Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands
and Turkey. Casually disregarded by the Vienna based UN Nuclear Watchdog
(IAEA), the US has actively contributed to the proliferation of nuclear
weapons in Western Europe.
As part of this European stockpiling, Turkey, which is a partner of the
US-led coalition against Iran along with Israel, possesses some 90
thermonuclear B61 bunker buster bombs at the Incirlik nuclear air base.
(National
Resources Defense Council, Nuclear Weapons in Europe,
February 2005)
By the recognized definition, these five countries are "undeclared
nuclear weapons states".
The stockpiling and deployment of tactical B61 in these five
"non-nuclear states" are intended for targets in the Middle East.
Moreover, in accordance with "NATO strike plans", these thermonuclear
B61 bunker buster bombs (stockpiled by the "non-nuclear States") could
be launched "against targets in Russia or countries in the Middle East
such as Syria and Iran" ( quoted in National Resources Defense Council,
Nuclear Weapons in Europe, February 2005)
Does this mean that Iran or Russia, which are potential targets of a
nuclear attack originating from one or other of these five so-called
non-nuclear states should contemplate defensive preemptive nuclear
attacks against Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Turkey? The
answer is no, by any stretch of the imagination.
While these "undeclared nuclear states" casually accuse Tehran of
developing nuclear weapons, without documentary evidence, they
themselves have capabilities of delivering nuclear warheads, which are
targeted at Iran. To say that this is a clear case of "double standards"
by the IAEA and the "international community" is a understatement.

information
The stockpiled weapons are B61 thermonuclear bombs. All the weapons are
gravity bombs of the B61-3, -4, and -10 types 2.
Those estimates were based on private and public statements by a number
of government sources and assumptions about the weapon storage capacity
at each base
Germany - Nuclear Weapons Producer
Among the five "undeclared
nuclear states", "Germany remains the most heavily nuclearized country
with three nuclear bases (two of which are fully operational) and may
store as many as 150 [B61 bunker buster ] bombs" (Ibid). In accordance
with "NATO strike plans" (mentioned above) these tactical nuclear
weapons are also targeted at the Middle East.
While Germany is not categorized officially as a nuclear power, it
produces nuclear warheads for the French Navy. It stockpiles nuclear
warheads (made in America) and it has the capabilities of delivering
nuclear weapons.
Moreover, The European Aeronautic Defense
and Space Company -
EADS, a Franco-German-Spanish joint
venture, controlled by Deutsche Aerospace and the powerful Daimler Group
is Europe's second largest military producer, supplying .France's M51
nuclear missile.
Germany imports and deploys nuclear weapons from the US. It also
produces nuclear warheads which are exported to France. Yet it is
classified as a non-nuclear state.
