The President now has the power, under secret
arrangements already established, to seize total dictatorial control. Can he
hold such power and not use it? If he has no intention of asserting this
secret power, why did the White House go to the trouble of setting it up?
Unknown to virtually all Americans except for the tiny handful who make up
his administrations inner circle. Jimmy Carter promulgated a secret program
to suspend the Constitution and to clamp executive dictatorship on the
nation whenever, in his judgment, conditions warrant the declaration of
national emergency.
A young policy analyst who helped draft the original directives have
described the new program as a White
House stratagem to replace the American Constitutional structure with a
so-called command system in which you will be subject to total
bureaucratic control.
The years since the inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 have been
a history of relentless bureaucratic encroachment on the rights of American
citizens, the sources acknowledge.
Yet these people, who are familiar with
Carters design, described the new plan as,
the most dangerous internal
attack on our system since independence.
It is a,
quiet coup detat that
will end up making the Soviet Union look mild and permissive by comparison,
they said.
A major White House directive, known as Presidential Review Memorandum 32 (PRM 32), inaugurated the new order last year as a national administrative
reorganization project allegedly designed to help the country deal more
effectively with disasters and mass emergencies. In a sharp break with
tradition, PRM 32 has been hidden from the public under a high level of
security classification.
It has never been published in full, even in the
Federal Register.
Since the Roosevelt era, executive orders (EOs)
presidential decrees which acquire the force of law have been utilized by
the mushrooming bureaucracy to extend its control. The most pervasive and
therefore potentially the most damaging executive order prior to 1977 was
promulgated by President Richard M. Nixon on October 28, 1969.
Known as EO
11490, the so-called omnibus emergency preparedness decree, it
incorporated 23 earlier EOs into a so-called umbrella ukase granting the
national bureaucracy wide powers, in civil or military crisis conditions,
to literally seize the entire country and every man, woman and child in it.
The following Executive Orders are some of the consolidated orders into EO
11490:
-
Executive Order 10995 provides for the takeover of the communications media.
-
Executive Order 10997 provides for the takeover of all electric, power,
petroleum, gas, fuels and minerals this includes well water.
-
Executive Order 10988 provides for the takeover of food resources and farms.
-
Executive Order 10999 provides for the takeover of all modes of
transportation, control of highways, seaports, etc.
-
Executive Order 11000 provides for mobilization of all civilians into work
brigades under the Government supervision.
-
Executive Order 11001 Provides for Governmental takeover of all health,
education and welfare functions.
-
Executive Order 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a
national registration of all persons.
-
Executive Order 11003 provides for the Government to lake over airports and
aircraft.
-
Executive Order 11004 provides for the Housing and Finance
Authority to relocate communities, designate areas to be abandoned, and
establish new locations for populations.
-
Executive Order 11005 provides for
the Government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage
facilities.
As the Liberty Lobby noted first in a 1965 pamphlet now seen as a classic
prophecy:
More frightening than all its contents if the omission of a
definition of the phrase national emergency. The decision as to what
constitutes a national emergency is left to the capricious whim of just
one man: the president, whoever he might be.
This feature has always been the most menacing aspect of government by
bureaucratic order disguised as emergency management.
But past
administrations have found it politically hazardous to invoke crisis
conditions without being confronted by some sort of threat of disaster
genuine or staged which alarmed large numbers of citizens.
Any president can be sure of wielding political control only over his own
appointees.
"Since in the past the execution of EOs was the responsibility
of long established departments and agencies the Department of Justice, for
Instance, or the Federal Bank Supervisory Agencies there were some built in
limitations on just how far this presidential power grab could reach.
With the advent of the Carter era, all this began to change.
The
National
Security Council in the executive branch was handed over to trusted academic
henchmen of the Rockefeller dynasty, to pragmatic professors such as
Zbigniew Brzezinski and Professor
Samuel Huntington, who view the U.S. as a
techinetronic society in which the Constitution and its safeguards are no
longer relevant.
Huntington, known as the author of a major
Trilateral
position paper arguing that jet-age America needed a centralized,
bureaucratic government, was put in charge of drawing up the framework for
it.
Appointed to the senior staff of the National Security Council soon
after Carters election, Huntington came up with a study suggesting that the
most effective road to a fully bureaucratized and systems-managed U.S. lay
through a total approach to federal emergency management.
Critics have dubbed him Samuel Mad Dog Huntington for his zeal in
promoting bureaucratic totalitarianism. But the Trilateral professor is man
of dangerous brilliance.
He saw that crisis management could be used to
replace the Constitutional system if two main flaws were removed its
dependence: on the traditional civil service for enforcement: and on some
sort of visible, alarming disaster or dislocation for justification.
Secret Crisis Invented
Threats or catastrophes justifying the imposition of a state of national
emergency by the president could be staged or arranged: the origins of World
War II were a historic reminder of that.
But staging a upheaval which would
appear credible to most citizens takes money, energy and time. Why not
devise a classified emergency a secret crisis, as it were, which existed
solely on the say-so of the president?
Huntington knew that he had the
makings of just such an invisible emergency in the space age menace of
nuclear terrorism. On November 4, 1975, the chairman of the board of giant
Union Oil Co., Fred Hartley, received and anonymous letter in his Los
Angeles office threatening the detonation of a nuclear device unless Union
Oil paid $1 million in ransom-small bills in two suitcases.
FBI experts
flown in from Washington judged the letter to be a credible threat that
is, written by someone who may have actually assembled a kitchen table
nuclear device. Six days later agents arrested Frank James, a 63 year old
car salesman, and nothing like a bomb or its makings was found. James was
charged only with a threat to destroy property, not with the far more
serious crime of blackmail.
Although James was convicted in October, 1976
and sent to prison for about six months, the evidence in the case remained
murky. James maintains to this day that he was innocent and the victim of a
federal set-up.
Huntington concluded, was the ideal situation; a national emergency which
could be triggered by a single nuclear blackmail note-a letter which could
originate with a genuine terrorist or on a White House typewriter with equal
facility enabling the president to assume command of the country.
To maximize the impact of such and event, as the official jargon has it,
Huntington proposed the formation of a separate bureaucracy to deal with
various aspects of the crisis.
From these suggestions there emerged, in the
spring of 1979, a new staff organization called Federal Emergency Management
Agency, or
FEMA.
As befits a brand new bureaucracy destined to manage the nations affairs.
FEMA capitalized on the already existing 10 Regional Government Councils
which were established during the administrations of Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon and set up a district office in each of them.
In Washington, its
authority grew as on presidential orders it assumed control of a chain of
older agencies:
-
the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration
-
the Federal
Insurance Administration
-
the National Weather Service
-
the Federal
Emergency Broadcast System
-
and a dozen others...
In the Justice Department, for instance, the senior FEMA officer will take
charge and direct the imposition of,
those restraints that the exigencies of
a dire peacetime nuclear emergency might necessitate with respect to the
free exercise of Constitutional and other basic rights and liberties.
The
FEMA agents directing the machinery of the Department of Justice will also
assist the FEMA officers who have taken charge of the Department of Health
and Human Services in setting up mental health centers where citizens
considered deranged or overly upset may be confined at the pleasure of the
president by administrative order.
FEMA controllers working with the Department of Agriculture staff will issue
commands concerning the decontamination, safekeeping and distribution of
food supplies. In the treasury, they will impose a moratorium on banks and
administer the printing of money during the emergency.
What is foreseen is
a system of government most closely resembling a state of martial law, but
that is nothing new; what they are not telling you and the reason the
government can write secret laws to enslave you and then not tell you that
they are on the books, is because the martial law from the Civil War time
when it was put into place then has never been rescinded.
Our civil
liberties have simply been swept away one by one.
They have been boiling the
frog (you) slowly for a very long time and they are just about ready to put
the lid on the pot. The executive bureaucracy will have absolute power, and
the duration of their rule will be determined wholly by the presidents
personal view of the emergency.
American people the time to wake up is
today; you have been screwed by your government and the men that you vote to
put in power to do the right things for you and your country and as long as
they can keep you pacified and ignorant they will put the people of America
into a technotronic dictatorship, and take all of you rights and liberties
away from you and put you into total slavery if you dont wake up and take
the power back that you have for to long given away to people that dont
care for your well being, but only theirs.
Carter ordered into being an entire apparatus unprecedented in American
history designed to seize and exercise all political, economic and military
power in the United Slates, establishing the president as total dictator.
He did this with and executive order.
History of Executive Orders
Under the Constitution of the United States, the president is vested with
the executive power of the government (Article II, Section 1, Clause 1), the
power to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution (Article II,
Section 1, Clause 7), and the power to see that the laws are faithfully
executed (Article II Section 3).
From these powers is implied the authority
to issue executive orders.
An executive order has never been defined by Congress
The validity of executive orders has been questioned many times, but a
ruling as to the extent or limit to which they may be used has never been
determined by the courts or by Congress (Library of CONGRESS, Legislative
Research Service #398/117-9)
The Federal Register contains the text of directives issued under the
authority of the president. No congressional authorization is required.
There is no review by the judiciary.
All executive orders (EOs) are laws
made by one man-the president of the United States.
Through existing EOs, it is possible for one man to ignore the Constitution,
Congress and the will of the people. A complete dictatorship can be imposed,
under the veil of law, on the American people. During the Nixon presidency,
an attempt was made to incorporate all of the national emergency powers of
the presidency into an omnibus order which would cover most or ail of the
situations requiring the use of the power.
This became known as Executive
Order 11490.
Under the terms of EO 11490, the president of the United States could
order that a national emergency exists.
In this list please, notice how many of these
relate directly to the vast connections it has back to the December 15, 1865
covenant that was put into place with the formation of the United States
Military Railroad for transportation and communication and public services,
to be put into operations for the president and military to be seized in the
time of national emergency or war, and was to remain in operation forever
for the president.
Folks, this has been on the planning board for a
very long time.

All of these items listed, plus many others clearly enumerated on 32 pages
incorporating nearly 200,000 words, pertain to every previous executive
order ever issued unless specifically revoked.
When Carter look office, EO
11490 was incorporated into a new plan ordered into existence by
Presidential Review Memorandum 32.
This gave the mantle of law to another
executive order #12148, titled Federal Emergency Management. All prior EOs
having anything to do with emergency planning have been incorporated into
it. The order gives the president absolute power during any emergency so
declared by him, to be kept by him until specifically revoked by action of
the legislature.
Go to your local law library and look up in its entirety the Federal
Emergency Management under Executive
Orders 12148 dated July 20,1979.
