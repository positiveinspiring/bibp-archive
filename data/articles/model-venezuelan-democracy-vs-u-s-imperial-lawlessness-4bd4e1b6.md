# Model Venezuelan Democracy vs. U.S. Imperial Lawlessness

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_globalelite_la75.htm

Venezuelan democracy is real. It's the
hemisphere's best. It shames America's sham system.
It threatens no other country. It doesn't
bully, harass, invade or terror-bomb them. It fosters
good relations with all nations. Its Constitution mandates governance of,
by and for everyone equitably. Its policies are polar
opposite US imperial lawlessness.
On Wednesday, President Nicholas Maduro
initiated an international campaign challenging Obama
outrageously calling Venezuela a threat to US national
security.
It deserves universal support.
He wrote
an
open letter to Americans
affirming Venezuela
threatens no one.
"(O)ur people believe in peace and
respect for all nations," he said. "In two centuries of
independence," Venezuela never attacked another country.
It threatens none now.
"We are a peaceful
people," Maduro stressed.
"Our people live in a region of peace,
free of weapons of mass destruction, and in freedom to
practice all religions."
"We uphold respect for international law
and the sovereignty of all people of the world."
Obama outrageously declaring Venezuela a
threat to US national security flies in the face of
fundamental,
"principles of sovereignty and
self-determination under international law," said Maduro.
All 33 Community of Latin American and
Caribbean States (CELAC) oppose his action.
So do all 12 Union of South American
Nations (UNASUR).
Free people everywhere reject US
imperial lawlessness.
"President Obama, without any authority
to interfere in our internal affairs, unilaterally
issued a set of sanctions against Venezuelan officials
with potentially far-reaching implications, interfering
in our constitutional order and our justice system,"
said Maduro.
"We believe that our world must be based
on the rules of international law, without interference
in the internal affairs of other countries."
"We are convinced that the relationship
of respect between all the nations is the only path for
strengthening peace and coexistence, as well as for
ensuring a more just world."
Throughout his tenure, Obama did what his
supporters thought impossible.
He exceeded the worst of
his predecessors. He wages out-of-control war on humanity
at home and abroad.
He threatens nuclear war on Russia.
"Never before (did a US president try) to
govern Venezuelans by decree," said Maduro.
"It is a tyrannical and imperial order,
and it pushes us back into the darkest days of the
relationship between the United States and Latin America
and the Caribbean."
Millions of Venezuelans won't tolerate
him interfering in their lives.
Nor should free people
anywhere.
Cease "hostile actions against Venezuelan
people and democracy," Maduro demanded.
Rescind executive order authority
outrageously declaring Venezuela a US national security
threat.
Retract "libelous and defamatory
statements and actions against the honorable Venezuelan
officials who have just obeyed our laws and our
constitution," Maduro added.
He quoted Simon Bolivar saying,
"(t)he
freedom of the New World is the hope of the universe."
"(O)ur freedom is a right we shall never
give up because the future of humanity lies in our
country," Maduro stressed.
Venezuela represents "hope. Independence
or nothing."
On Thursday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister
Delcy Rodriguez addressed an Organization of American
States (OAS) extraordinary session. She blasted Obama's imperial arrogance.
She noted his outrageous executive order and lawless
sanctions.
"History has shown that (these type
actions) tend to precede military interventions," she
said.
She repeated her earlier warning of a
possible Cuba-style economic blockade.
"I emphasize that we are talking about
historic facts," she said. "We arent imagining this,
and we're saying that history has repeatedly shown this,
and this is a real threat."
"It's not just about (sanctioning)
certain officials" or issuing dictatorial diktats.
Venezuelan officials are targeted for
defending national sovereignty and democratic rights,
she explained.
"Our task is to preserve our
sovereignty," she stressed. "How can Venezuela be
considered a threat to the world's most powerful
county," she asked?
"(O)ur army has never left our borders to
conquer other territories. Our diplomacy has always been
peaceful."
Deputy US OAS representative Michael J.
Fitzpatrick lied claiming Obama's diktat was taken out
of context.
America isn't,
"preparing military action
against Venezuela
(It's) not look(ing) to overthrown
(its) government
nor affect (its) economy," he claimed.
Facts contradict him:
-
Bush and Obama went all-out to
destabilize Venezuela politically and economically.
-
Two coup plots failed. Disruptive
efforts continue. Washington supports Venezuelan
fascists.
-
It want tyranny replacing model
hemispheric democracy. It wants Bolivarian social
justice ended.
-
It wants Venezuela recolonized. It
wants it returned to US client state status.
-
It wants its vast oil reserves
plundered for profit. It wants its people ruthlessly
exploited. It wants all rights Venezuelans enjoy
ended.
-
It wants what they won't tolerate.
America is humanity's greatest threat.
Anti-imperial activists of the world
unite. Challenging US ruthlessness is more important
than ever.
Survival depends on it.
On Thursday, Venezuelan National Assembly
President Diosdado Cabello warned about fascist elements
desperate to regain parliamentary control.
US-manipulated disruptive efforts to oust
Maduro could follow, he said.
Much like what happened in
Honduras in June 2009 and Paraguay in June 2012. Cabello urged Venezuelans to unite
against dark forces threatening them - to defend against
anti-democratic internal elements and US imperial
intentions.
Preserving Bolivarianism requires
nationwide solidarity against what Bolivar called the
imperial curse,
"plagu(ing) Latin America with misery in
the name of liberty."
Maduro continues what Chavez began.
Bolivarian social justice is too precious to lose. It's hardwired and institutionalized.
Venezuelans won't tolerate returning to their ugly past.
Nor should they!
