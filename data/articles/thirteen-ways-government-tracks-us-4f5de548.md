One.
The National Security Agency (NSA)
collects hundreds of millions of emails, texts and phone calls every
day and has the ability to collect and sift through billions more.
WIRED just reported NSA is building an
immense new data center which will intercept, analyze and store even
more electronic communications from satellites and cables across the
nation and the world. Though NSA is not supposed to focus on US
citizens, it does.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) National Security Branch Analysis Center (NSAC) has more than

The American Civil Liberties Union and
the New York Times recently reported that cellphones of private
individuals in the US are being tracked without warrants by state
and local law enforcement all across the country.
With more than 300 million cellphones in
the US connected to more than 200,000 cell phone towers, cellphone
tracking software can pinpoint the location of a phone and document
the places the cellphone user visits over the course of a day, week,
month or longer.

More than 62 million people in the US
have their fingerprints on file with the FBI, state and local
governments. This system, called the Integrated Automated
Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), shares information with
43 states and 5 federal agencies. This system conducts more than
168,000 checks each day.

Over 126 million people have their
fingerprints, photographs and biographical information accessible on
the US Department of Homeland Security Automated Biometric
Identification System (IDENT).
This system conducts about 250,000
biometric transactions each day. The goal of this system is to
provide information for national security, law enforcement,
immigration, intelligence and other Homeland Security Functions.

More than 110 million people have their
visas and more than 90 million have their photographs entered into
the US Department of State Consular Consolidated Database (CCD).
This system grows by adding about 35,000 people a day. This system
serves as a gateway to the Department of State Facial Recognition
system, IDENT and IAFSIS.

Information on over 740,000 people is
included in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) of
the National Counterterrorism Center. TIDE is the US government
central repository of information on international terrorist
identities.
The government says that less than 2
percent of the people on file are US citizens or legal permanent
residents. They were just given permission to keep their
non-terrorism information on US citizens for a period of five years,
up from 180 days.

Tens of thousands of people are subjects
of facial recognition software. The FBI has been working with North
Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles and other state and local law
enforcement on facial recognition software in a project called Face
Mask.
For example, the FBI has provided
thousands of photos and names to the North Carolina DMV which runs
those against their photos of North Carolina drivers. The Maricopa
Arizona County Sheriffs Office alone records 9,000 biometric mug
shots a month.

Twelve.
The FBI operates the Nationwide
Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative (SAR) that collects and
analyzes observations or reports of suspicious activities by local
law enforcement.
With over 160,000 suspicious activity
files, SAR stores the profiles of tens of thousands of Americans and
legal residents who are not accused of any crime but who are alleged
to have acted suspiciously.

The FBI admits it has about 3,000 GPS
