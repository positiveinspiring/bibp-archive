Financial strategists do not intend to let todays debt crisis go to waste.
Foreclosure time has arrived. That means
revolution - or more accurately, a counter-revolution to roll back the 20th
centurys gains made by social democracy: pensions and social security,
public health care and other infrastructure providing essential services at
subsidized prices or for free.
The basic model follows the former Soviet
Unions post-1991 neoliberal reforms: privatization of public enterprises, a
high flat tax on labor but only nominal taxes on real estate and finance,
and deregulation of the economys prices, working conditions and credit
terms.
What is to be reversed is the modern agenda.
The aim a century ago was to
mobilize the Industrial Revolutions soaring productivity and technology to
raise living standards and use progressive taxation, public regulation,
central banking and financial reform to distribute wealth fairly and make
societies more equal. Todays financial aim is the opposite: to concentrate
wealth at the top of the economic pyramid and lower labors returns.
High
finance loves low wages.
The political lever to achieve this program is financial. The European Union
(EU) constitution prevents central banks from financing government deficits,
leaving this role to commercial banks, paying interest to them for creating
credit that central banks readily monetize for themselves in Britain and the
United States.
Governments are to go into debt to bail out banks for loans
gone bad - as do more and more loans as finance impoverishes the economy,
stifling its ability to pay. Yet as long as we live in democracies, voters
must agree to pay.
Governments are sovereign and debt is ultimately a
creature of the law and courts.
But first they need to understand what is happening. From the bankers
perspective, the economic surplus is what they themselves end up with.
Rising consumption standards and even public investment in infrastructure
are seen as deadweight. Bankers and bondholders aim to increase the surplus
not so much by tangible capital investment increasing the overall surplus,
but by more predatory means, headed by rolling back labors gains and
stiffening working conditions while gaining public subsidy.
Banks create
wealth by providing more credit (that is, debt leverage) to bid up asset
prices for real estate and enterprises already in place - assets that either
are being foreclosed on or sold off under debt pressure by private owners or
governments.
One commentator recently characterized the latter strategy of
privatization as,
tantamount to selling the family silver only to have to
rent it back in order to eat dinner. [1]
Fought in the name of free markets, this counter-revolution rejects the
classical ideal of markets free of unearned income paid to special
interests.
The financial objective is to squeeze out a surplus by maximizing
the margin of prices over costs. Opposing government enterprise and
infrastructure as the road to serfdom, high finance is seeking to turn
public infrastructure into rent-extracting tollbooths to extract economic
rent (the free lunch economy), while replacing labor unions with non-union
labor so as to work it more intensively.
This new road to neoserfdom is an asset grab.
But to achieve it, the
financial sector needs a political grab to replace democracy with financial
technocrats. Their job is to pretend that there is no revolution at all,
merely an increase in efficiency, creating wealth by debt-leveraging the
economy to the point where the entire surplus is paid out as interest to the
financial managers who are emerging as Western civilizations new central
planners.
Frederick Hayeks
Road to Serfdom portrayed a dystopia of public officials
seeking to regulate the economy.
In attacking government so one-sidedly, his
ideological extremism sought to replace the checks and balances of mixed
economies with a private sector free of regulation and consumer
protection. His vision was of a post-modern economy free of the classical
reforms to bring market prices into line with cost value.
Instead of
purifying industrial capitalism from the special rent extraction privileges
bequeathed from the feudal epoch, Hayeks ideology opened the way for
unchecked financial power to make a travesty of free markets.
The European Unions financial planners claim that Greece and other debtor
countries have a problem that is easy to cure by imposing austerity. Pension
savings, Social Security and medical insurance are to be downsized so as to
free more debt service to be paid to creditors.
Insisting that Greece only
has a liquidity problem, European Central Bank (ECB) extremists deem an
economy solvent as long as it has assets to privatize.
ECB executive board
member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi explained the plan in a Financial Times
interview:
FT: Otmar Issing, your former colleague, says Greece is insolvent and it
will not be physically possible for it to repay its debts. Is he right?
LBS: He is wrong because Greece is solvent if it applies the program. They
have assets that they can sell and reduce their debt and they have the
instruments to change their tax and expenditure systems to reduce the debt.
This is the assessment of the IMF, it is the assessment of the European
Commission.
Poor developing countries have no assets, their income is low, and so they
become insolvent easily. If you look at the balance sheet of Greece, it is
not insolvent.
The key problem is political will on the part of the government and
parliament.
Privatization proceeds of 50bn, which is being talked about -
some mention more - would reduce the peak debt to GDP ratio from 160 per
cent to about 140 per cent or 135 per cent and this could be reduced
further.[2]
A week later Mr. Bini Smaghi insisted that the public sector,
had marketable assets worth 300 billion
Euros and was not bankrupt. Greece should be considered solvent and
should be asked to service its debts
signaling that the bank remained
firmly opposed to any plan to allow Greece to stretch out its debt
payments or oblige investors to accept less than full repayment, a
so-called haircut. [3]
Speaking from Berlin, he said that Greece was
not insolvent.
It could pay off its bonds owed to German
bankers ($22.7 billion), French bankers ($15 billion) and the ECB (reported
to be on the hook for $190 billion) by selling off public land and ports,
water and sewer rights, ownership of the telephone system and other basic
infrastructure. In addition to getting paid in full and receiving high
interest rates reflecting market expectations of non-payment, the banks
would enjoy a new credit market financing privatization buy-outs.
Warning that failure to pay would create windfall gains for speculators who
had bet that Greece would default, Mr. Bini Smaghi refused to acknowledge
the corollary: to pay the full amount would create windfalls for those who
bet that Greece would be forced to pay.
He also claimed that:
Restructuring
of Greek debt would
discourage Greece from modernizing its economy.
But
the less debt service an economy pays, the more revenue it has to invest
productively. And to solve the problem by throwing public assets on the
market would create windfalls for distress buyers.
As the Wall Street
Journal put matters bluntly:
Greece is for sale - cheap - and Germany is
buying. German companies are hunting for bargains in Greece as the
debt-stricken government moves to sell state-owned assets to stabilize the
countrys finances. [4]
Rather than raising living standards while creating a more egalitarian and
fair society, the ECBs creditor-oriented reforms would roll the time
clock
back to oligarchy.
Not the post-feudal oligarchy of landlords owning
land conquered militarily, but a financial oligarchy accumulating banking
claims and bonds growing inexorably and exponentially, leaving little over
for the rest of the economy to invest or consume.
The distinction
between illiquidity and insolvency
If a homeowner loses his job and cannot pay his mortgage, he must sell the
house or see the bank foreclose. Is he insolvent, or merely illiquid?
If
he merely has a liquidity problem, a loan will help him earn the funds to
pay down the debt. But if he falls into the negative equity that now plagues
a quarter of U.S. real estate, taking on more loans will only deepen his net
deficit. Ending this process by losing his home does not mean that he is
merely illiquid. He is in distress, and is suffering from insolvency.
But to
the ECB this is merely a liquidity problem.
The public balance sheet includes land and infrastructure as if they are
surplus assets that can be forfeited without fundamentally changing the
owners status or social relations. In reality it is part of the means of
survival in todays world, at least survival as part of the middle class.
For starters, renegotiating his loan wont help an insolvency situation such
as the jobless homeowner above. Lending him the money to pay the bank
interest (along with late fees and other financial penalties) or stretching
out the loan merely will add to the debt balance, giving the foreclosing
bank yet a larger claim on whatever property the debtor may have available
to grab.
But the homeowner is in danger of being homeless, living on the street. At
issue is whether solvency should be defined in the traditional common-sense
way, in terms of the ability of income to carry ones current obligations,
or a purely balance-sheet approach taken by creditors seeking to extract
payment by stripping assets. This is Greeces position.
Is it merely a
liquidity problem if the government is told to sell off $50 billion in prime
tourist sites, ports, water systems and other public assets in order to pay
foreign creditors?
At issue is language regarding the legal rights of creditors vis-à-vis
debtors. The United States has long had a body of law regarding this issue.
A few years ago, for instance, the real estate speculator Sam Zell bought
the Chicago Tribune in a debt-leveraged buyout. The newspaper soon went
broke, wiping out the employees stock ownership plan (ESOP).
They sued
under the fraudulent conveyance law, which says that if a creditor makes a
loan without knowing how the debtor can pay in the normal course of
business, the loan is assumed to have been made with the intent of
foreclosing on property, and is deemed fraudulent.
This law dates from colonial times, when British speculators eyed rich New
York farmland. Their ploy was to extend loans to farmers, and then call in
the loans when the farmers ability to pay was low, before the crop was
harvested. This was indeed a liquidity problem - which financial
opportunists turned into an asset grab.
Some lenders, to be sure, created a
genuine insolvency problem by making loans beyond the ability of the farmers
to pay, and then would foreclose on their land. The colonies nullified such
loans.
Fraudulent conveyance laws have been kept on the books since the
United States won its independence from Britain.
Creditors today are using debt leverage to force Greece to sell off its
public domain - having extended credit beyond its ability to pay. So the
question now being raised is whether the nation should be deemed solvent
if the only way to carry its public debt (that is, roll it over by replacing
bad old loans with newer and more inexorable obligations) is to forfeit its
land and basic infrastructure.
This would fundamentally alter the
relationship between public and private sectors, replacing its mixed economy
with a centrally planned one - planned by financial predators with little
care that the economy is polarizing between rich and poor, creditors and
debtors.
The financial road to
serfdom
Financial lobbyists are turning the English language - and economic
terminology throughout the world - into a battlefield.
Creditors are to be
permitted to take the assets of insolvent debtors - from homeowners and
companies to entire nations - as if this were a normal working of the
market and foreclosure was simply a way to restore liquidity.
As for
solvency, the ECB would strip Greece clean of its public sectors assets.
Bank officials have spoken of throwing potentially 150 billion Euros of
property onto the market.
Most people would think of this as a solvency problem. Solvency means the
ability to maintain the kind of society one has, with existing
public/private checks and balances and living standards. It is incompatible
with scaling down pensions, Social Security and medical insurance to save
bondholders and bankers from taking a loss.
The latter policy is nothing
less than a political revolution.
The asset stripping that Europes bankers are demanding of Greece looks like
a dress rehearsal to prevent the I wont pay movement from spreading to
Indignant Citizens movements against financial austerity in Spain,
Portugal and Italy.
Bankers are trying to block governments from writing
down debts, stretching out loans and reducing interest rates.
When a nation is directed to replace its mixed economy by transferring
ownership of public infrastructure and enterprises to a financial class
(mainly foreign), this is not merely restoring solvency by using long-term
assets to pay short-term debts to maintain its balance-sheet net worth. It
is a radical transformation to a centrally planned economy, shifting control
out of the hands of elected representatives to those of financial managers
whose time frame is short-term and extractive, not long-term and protective
of social equity and basic needs.
Creditors are demanding a political transformation to replace democratic
lawmakers with technocrats appointed by foreign bankers.
When the economic
surplus is pledged to bankers rather than invested at home, we are not
merely dealing with insolvency but with an aggressive attack. Finance
becomes a continuation of war, by economic means that are to be politicized.
Acting on behalf of the commercial banks (from which most of its directors
are drawn, and to which they intend to descend from heaven to take their
rewards after serving their financial class), the European Central Bank
insists on a political revolution to replace democratic government by a
technocratic elite - not of industrial engineers, but of financial
engineers, a polite name for asset stripping financial warriors.
If Greece
does not comply, they threaten to wreak domestic financial havoc by pulling
the plug on Greek banks. This carrot and stick approach threatens that if
Greece does not sign on, the ECB and IMF will withhold loans needed to keep
its banking system solvent.
The carrot was provided on May 31 they agreed
to provide $86 billion in Euros if Greece,
puts off for the time being a
restructuring, hard or soft, of its public debt.[5]
It is a travesty to present this revolution simply as a financial exercise
in solving the liquidity problem as if it were compatible with Europes
past four centuries of political and classical economic reforms.
This is why
the
Syntagma Square protest in front of Parliament has been growing each
week, peaking at over 70,000 last Sunday, June 5.
Some protestors drew a parallel with the Wisconsin politicians who left the
state to prevent a quorum from voting on the anti-labor program that
Governor Walker tried to ram through.
The next day, on June 6, thirty
backbenchers of Prime Minister George Papandreous ruling Panhellenic
Socialist party (Pasok) were joined by some of his own cabinet ministers
threatening,
to resign their parliamentary seats rather than vote through
measures to cut thousands of public sector jobs, increase taxes again and
dispose of 50bn of state assets, according to party insiders.
The biggest
issue for the party is stringent cuts in the public sector... these go to
the heart of Pasoks model of social protection by providing jobs in state
entities for its supporters, said a senior Socialist official. [6]
Seeing the popular reluctance to commit financial suicide, Conservative
Opposition leader Antonis Samaras also opposed paying the European bankers,
demanding a renegotiation of the package agreed last week with the troika
of the EU, IMF and the European Central Bank.
It was obvious that no party
could gain popular support for the ECBs demand that Greece relinquish
popular rule and,
appoint experienced technocrats to half a dozen essential
ministries to implement the EU-IMF program. [7]
ECB President Trichet depicts himself as following Erasmus in bringing
Europe beyond its strict concept of nationhood. This is to be done by
replacing elected officials with a bureaucracy of cosmopolitan
banker-friendly planners.
The debt problem calls for new,
monetary policy
measures - we call them non standard decisions, strictly separated from
the standard decisions, and aimed at restoring a better transmission of
our monetary policy in these abnormal market conditions.
The task at hand
is to make these conditions a new normalcy - and re-defining solvency to
reflect a nations ability to pay debts by selling the public domain.
The ECB and EU claim that Greece is solvent as long as it has assets to
sell off.
But if populations in todays mixed economies think of solvency as
existing under existing public/private proportions, they will resist the
financial sectors attempt to proceed with buyouts and foreclosures until it
possesses all the assets in the world, all the hitherto public and corporate
assets and those of individuals and partnerships.
To minimize opposition to this dynamic the financial sectors pet economists
understate the debt burden, pretending that it can be paid without
disrupting economic life and, in the Greek case for example, by using mark
to model junk accounting and derivative swaps to simply conceal its
magnitude.
Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the IMF claims that the post-2008 debt
crisis is merely a short-term liquidity problem and one of lack of
confidence, not insolvency reflecting an underlying inability to pay.
Banks promise that everything will be all right when the economy returns to
normal - as if it can borrow its way out of debt, Bernanke-style.
This is what todays financial warfare is about. At issue is the financial
sectors relationship to the real economy.
From the latters perspective
the proper role of credit - that is, debt - is to fund productive capital
investment and spending, because it is out of the economic surplus that
debts are paid. This requires a financial regulatory system and tax system
to maximize growth.
But that is precisely the fiscal policy that todays
financial sector is fighting against. It demands preferential
tax-deductibility for interest to encourage debt financing rather than
equity. It has disabled truth-in-lending laws and regulations to keeping
interest rates and fees in line with costs of production. And it blocks
governments from having central banks to freely finance their own operations
and provide economies with money.
And to cap matters it now demands that
democratic society yield to centralized authoritarian financial rule.
Finance and democracy
- from mutual reinforcement to antagonism
The relationship between banking and democracy has taken many twists over
the centuries.
Earlier this year, democratic opposition to the ECB and IMF
attempt to impose austerity and privatization selloffs succeeded when
Icelands President Grímsson insisted on a national referendum on the
Icesave debt payment that Althing leaders had negotiated with Britain and
the Netherlands (if one can characterize abject capitulation as a real
negotiation).
To their credit, a heavy 3-to-2 majority of
Icelanders voted
No,
saving their economy from being driven into the debt peonage.
Democratic action historically has been needed to enforce debt collection.
Until four centuries ago royal treasuries typically were kept in the royal
bedroom, and loans to rulers were in the character of personal debts.
Bankers repeatedly found themselves burned, especially by Habsburg and
Bourbon despots on the thrones of Spain, Austria and France.
Loans to such
rulers were liable to expire upon their death, unless their successors
remained dependent on these same financiers rather than turning to their
rivals. The numerous bankruptcies of Spains autocratic Habsburg ruler
Charles V exhausted his credit, preventing the nation from raising funds to
defeat the rebellious Low Countries to the north.
The problem facing bankers was how to make loans permanent national
obligations. Solving this problem gave an advantage to parliamentary
democracies. It was a major factor enabling the Low Countries to win their
independence from Habsburg Spain in the 16th century.
The Dutch Republic
committed the entire nation to pay its public debts, binding the people
themselves, through their elected representatives who earmarked taxes to
their creditors. Bankers saw parliamentary democracy as a precondition for
making sound loans to governments. This security for bankers could be
achieved only from electorates having at least a nominal voice in
government.
And raising war loans was a key element in military rivalry in
an epoch when the maxim for survival was Money is the sinews of war.
As long as governments remained despotic, they found that their ability to
incur more debt was limited.
At this time,
the legal position of the King
qua borrower was obscure, and it was still doubtful whether his creditors
had any remedy against him in case of default. [8]
Earlier
Dutch-English financing had not satisfied creditors on this count.
When
Charles I borrowed 650,000 guilders from the Dutch States-General in 1625,
the two countries military alliance against Spain helped defer the implicit
constitutional struggle over who ultimately was liable for British debts.
The key financial achievement of parliamentary government was thus to
establish nations as political bodies whose debts were not merely the
personal obligations of rulers, but truly public and binding regardless of
who occupied the throne. This is why the first two democratic nations, the
Netherlands and Britain after its 1688 dynastic linkage between Holland and
Britain in the person of William I, and the emergence of Parliamentary
authority over public financing.
They developed the most active capital
markets and became Europes leading military powers.
A funded debt could
not be formed so long as the King and Parliament were fighting for the
mastery, concludes the financial historian Richard Ehrenberg.
It was only
after the [1688] revolution that the English State became what the Dutch
Republic had long been - a real corporation of individuals firmly associated
together, a permanent organism. [9]
In sum, nations emerged in their modern form by adopting the financial
characteristics of democratic city‑states.
The financial imperatives of
17th-century warfare helped make these democracies victorious, for the new
national financial systems facilitated military spending on a vastly
extended scale.
Conversely, the more despotic Spain, Austria and France
became, the greater the difficulty they found in financing their military
adventures.
Austria was left without credit, and consequently without much
debt by the end of the 18th century, the least credit-worthy and worst
armed country in Europe, as Sir James Steuart noted in 1767.[10]
It became fully dependent on British subsidies and loan guarantees by the
time of the Napoleonic Wars.
The modern epoch of war financing therefore went hand in hand with the
spread of parliamentary democracy. The situation was similar to that enjoyed
by plebeian tribunes in Rome in the early centuries of its Republic. They
were able to veto all military funding until the patricians made political
concessions. The lesson was not lost on 18th-century Protestant parliaments.
For war debts and other national obligations to become binding, the peoples
elected representatives had to pledge taxes. This could be achieved only by
giving the electorate a voice in government.
It thus was the desire to be repaid that turned the preference of creditors
away from autocracies toward democracies. In the end it was only from
democracies that they were able to collect. This of course did not
necessarily reflect liberal political convictions on the part of creditors.
They simply wanted to be paid.
Europes sovereign commercial cities developed the best credit ratings, and
hence were best able to employ mercenaries.
Access to credit was,
their most
powerful weapon in the struggle for their freedom, notes Ehrenberg, in an
age whose growth in the use of fire‑arms had forced them to surround
themselves with stronger fortifications. [11]
The problem was
that,
Anyone who gave credit to a prince knew that the repayment of the debt
depended only on his debtor's capacity and will to pay. The case was very
different for the cities, who had power as overlords, but were also
corporations, associations of individuals held in common bond.
According to
the generally accepted law each individual burgher was liable for the debts
of the city both with his person and his property.
But the tables are now turning, from Icelandic voters to the large crowds
gathering in Syntagma Square and elsewhere throughout Greece to oppose the
terms on which Prime Minister Papandreou has been negotiating an EU bailout
loan for the government - to bail out German and French banks.
Now that
nations are not raising money for war but to subsidize reckless predatory
bankers, Jean-Claude Trichet of the ECB recently suggested taking financial
policy out of the hands of democracy.
But if a country is still not delivering, I think all would agree that the
second stage has to be different.
-
Would it go too far if we envisaged, at
this second stage, giving euro area authorities a much deeper and
authoritative say in the formation of the countrys economic policies if
these go harmfully astray?
-
A direct influence, well over and above the
reinforced surveillance that is presently envisaged?
At issue is sovereignty itself, when it comes to government responsibility
for debts.
And in this respect the war being waged against Greece by the
European Central Bank (ECB) may best be seen as a dress rehearsal not only
for the rest of Europe, but for what financial lobbyists would like to bring
about in the United States.
