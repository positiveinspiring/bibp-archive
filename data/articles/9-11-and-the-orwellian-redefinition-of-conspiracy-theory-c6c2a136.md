While we were not watching, conspiracy theory has undergone Orwellian
redefinition.
A conspiracy theory no longer means an event explained by a conspiracy.
Instead, it now means any explanation, or even a fact, that is out of step
with the governments explanation and that of its media pimps.
For example, online news broadcasts of RT have been equated with conspiracy
theories by the New York Times simply because RT reports news and opinions
that the New York Times does not report and the US government does not
endorse.
In other words, as truth becomes uncomfortable for government and its
Ministry of Propaganda, truth is redefined as conspiracy theory, by which is
meant an absurd and laughable explanation that we should ignore.
When piles of carefully researched books, released government documents, and
testimony of eye witnesses made it clear that Oswald was not President John
F. Kennedys assassin, the voluminous research, government documents, and
verified testimony was dismissed as conspiracy theory.
In other words, the truth of the event was unacceptable to the authorities
and to the Ministry of Propaganda that represents the interests of
authorities.
The purest example of how Americans are shielded from truth is the medias
(including many Internet sites) response to the large number of
professionals who find the official explanation of
September 11, 2001,
inconsistent with everything they, as experts, know about physics,
chemistry, structural engineering, architecture, fires, structural damage,
the piloting of airplanes, the security procedures of the United States, NORADs capabilities, air traffic control, airport security, and other
matters.
These experts, numbering in the thousands, have been shouted down
by know-nothings in the media who brand the experts as conspiracy
theorists.
This despite the fact that the official explanation endorsed by the official
media is the most extravagant conspiracy theory in human history.
Lets take a minute to re-acquaint ourselves with the official explanation,
which is not regarded as a conspiracy theory despite the fact that it
comprises an amazing conspiracy.
The official truth is that a handful of
young Muslim Arabs who could not fly airplanes, mainly Saudi Arabians who
came neither from Iraq nor from Afghanistan, outwitted not only the CIA and
the FBI, but also all 16 US intelligence agencies and all intelligence
agencies of US allies including Israels Mossad, which is believed to have
penetrated every terrorist organization and which carries out assassinations
of those whom Mossad marks as terrorists.
In addition to outwitting every intelligence agency of the United States and
its allies, the handful of young Saudi Arabians outwitted the National
Security Council, the State Department, NORAD, airport security four times
in the same hour on the same morning, air traffic control, caused the US Air
Force to be unable to launch interceptor aircraft, and caused three
well-built steel-structured buildings, including one not hit by an airplane,
to fail suddenly in a few seconds as a result of limited structural damage
and small, short-lived, low-temperature fires that burned on a few floors.
The Saudi terrorists were even able to confound the laws of physics and
cause WTC building seven to collapse at free fall speed for several seconds,
a physical impossibility in the absence of explosives used in controlled
demolition.
The story that the government and the media have told us amounts to a
gigantic conspiracy, really a script for a James Bond film. Yet, anyone who
doubts this improbable conspiracy theory is defined into irrelevance by the
obedient media.
-
Anyone who believes an architect, structural engineer, or demolition expert
who says that the videos show that the buildings are blowing up, not falling
down
-
Anyone who believes a Ph.D. physicist who says that the official
explanation is inconsistent with known laws of physics
-
Anyone who believes
expert pilots who testify that non-pilots or poorly-qualified pilots cannot
fly airplanes in such maneuvers
-
Anyone who believes the 100 or more first
responders who testify that they not only heard explosions in the towers but
personally experienced explosions
-
Anyone who believes University of
Copenhagen nano-chemist Niels Harrit who
reports finding unreacted
nano-thermite in dust samples from the WTC towers
-
Anyone who is convinced
by experts instead of by propaganda,
...is dismissed as a kook.
In America today, and increasingly throughout the Western world, actual
facts and true explanations have been relegated to the realm of kookiness.
Only people who believe lies are socially approved and accepted as patriotic
citizens.
Indeed, a writer or newscaster is not even permitted to report the findings
of 9/11 skeptics. In other words, simply to report Professor Harrits
findings now means that you endorse them or agree with them. Everyone in the
US print and TV media knows that he/she will be instantly fired if they
report Harrits findings, even with a laugh.
Thus, although Harrit has
reported his findings on European television and has lectured widely on his
findings in Canadian universities, the fact that he and the international
scientific research team that he led found unreacted nano-thermite in the
WTC dust and have offered samples to other scientists to examine has to my
knowledge never been reported in the American media.
Even Internet sites on which I am among the readers favorites will not
allow me to report on Harrits findings.
As I reported earlier, I myself had experience with a Huffington Post
reporter who was keen to interview a Reagan presidential appointee who was
in disagreement with the Republican wars in the Middle East.
After he
published the interview that I provided at his request, he was terrified to
learn that I had reported findings of 9/11 investigators. To protect his
career, he quickly inserted on the online interview that my views on the
Iraq and Afghanistan invasions could be dismissed as I had reported
unacceptable findings about 9/11.
The unwillingness or inability to entertain any view of 9/11 different from
the official view dooms to impotence many Internet sites that are opposed to
the wars and to the rise of the domestic US police state. These sites, for
whatever the reasons, accept the governments explanation of 9/11; yet, they
try to oppose the war on terror and the police state which are the
consequences of accepting the governments explanation.
Trying to oppose the
consequences of an event whose explanation you accept is an impossible task.
If you believe that America was attacked by Muslim terrorists and is
susceptible to future attacks, then a war on terror and a domestic
police
state to root out terrorists become necessary to make Americans safe. The
idea that a domestic police state and open-ended war might be more dangerous
threats to Americans than terrorists is an impermissible thought.
A country whose population has been trained to accept the governments word
and to shun those who question it is a country without liberty in its
future.
