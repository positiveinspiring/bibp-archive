To weaken the moral fiber of the nation and to demoralize
workers in the labor class by creating mass unemployment. As
jobs dwindle due to the post industrial zero growth policies
introduced by
the Club of Rome, the report envisages demoralized
and discouraged workers resorting to alcohol and drugs. The
youth of the land will be encouraged by means of rock music and
drugs to rebel against the status quo, thus undermining and
eventually destroying the family unit. In this regard, the
Committee commissioned Tavistock Institute to prepare a
blueprint as to how this could be achieved. Tavistock directed
Stanford Research to undertake the work under the direction of
Professor Willis Harmon. This work later became known as the
"Aquarian Conspiracy".

The Programmers
Because of the intensive artillery barrages of World War I, many
soldiers were permanently impaired by shell shock. In 1921, the
Marquees of Tavistock, 11th Duke of Bedford, gave a building to
a group which planned to conduct rehabilitation programs for
shell shocked British soldiers. The group took the name of "Tavistock
Institute" after its benefactor. The General Staff of the
British Army decided it was crucial that they determine the
breaking point of the soldier under combat conditions. The Tavistock Institute was taken over by
Sir John Rawlings Reese,
head of the British Army Psychological Warfare Bureau.
A cadre of highly trained
specialists in psychological warfare was built up in total
secrecy. In fifty years, the name "Tavistock Institute appears
only twice in the Index of the New York Times, yet this group,
according to LaRouche and other authorities, organized and
trained the entire staffs of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS),
the Strategic Bombing Survey, Supreme Headquarters of the Allied
Expeditionary Forces, and other key American military groups
during World War II. During World War II, the Tavistock
Institute combined with the medical sciences division of the
Rockefeller Foundation for esoteric experiments with
mind-altering drugs. The present drug culture of the United
States is traced in its entirety to this Institute, which
supervised the Central Intelligence Agencys training programs.
The "LSD counter culture" originated
when Sandoz A.G., a Swiss pharmaceutical house owned by
S.G.
Warburg & Co., developed a new drug from lysergic acid, called
LSD. James Paul Warburg (son of Paul Warburg who had written the
Federal Reserve Act in 1910), financed a subsidiary of the Tavistock Institute in the United States called the
Institute
for Policy Studies, whose director, Marcus Raskin, was appointed
to the National Security Council. James Paul Warburg set up a
CIA program to experiment with LSD on CIA agents, some of whom
later committed suicide. This program,
MK-Ultra, supervised by
Dr. Gottlieb, resulted in huge lawsuits against the United
States Government by the families of the victims.
The English Tavistock Institute has not restricted its
activities to left-wing groups, but has also directed the
programs of such supposedly "conservative" American think tanks
as the:
The "sensitivity training" and "sexual
encounter" programs of the most radical California groups such
as
Esalen Institute and its many imitators were all developed
and implemented by Tavistock Institute psychologists.
One of the rare items concerning the Tavistock Institute appears
in Business Week, Oct. 26, 1963, with a photograph of its
building in the most expensive medical offices area of London.
The story mentions "the Freudian bias" of the Institute, and
comments that it is amply financed by British blue-chip
corporations, including Unilever, British Petroleum, and Baldwin
Steel. According to Business Week, the psychological testing
programs and group relations training programs of the Institute
were implemented in the United States by the University of
Michigan and the University of California, which are hotbeds of
radicalism and the drug network.
It was the Marquees of Tavistock, 12th Duke of Bedford, whom
Rudolf Hess flew to England to contact about ending World War
II. Tavistock was said to be worth $40 million in 1942. In 1945,
his wife committed suicide by taking an overdose of pills.
APPENDIX I - SECRETS OF THE FEDERAL
RESERVE By Eustace Mullins
Research into the use of microwave weapons and their use for
mind control began in 1950s at the Tavistock Institute, one of
Britain's leading psychiatric research establishments. The UK
institute was researching into ways of mind controlling the
British population without them knowing. The monkey submission
response, whereby the dominant monkey caused submissive behaviour in the underlings, was the brain state of most
interest to the British scientists. Having found this specific
brain rhythm for docile submissive, zombie-like behaviour, it
was then recorded and used as the template for the ELF signal
beamed on UK microwave transmitters. Britain was the first
discoverer of microwave technology, used for radar, in the 1940s
and therefore had a commanding lead over everyone else in this
field.
