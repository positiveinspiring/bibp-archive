To date, citizens of 18 states have petitioned the
White House for consideration of a peaceful withdrawal from the United
States.
Thats right, thousands of Americans have
already signed petitions at whitehouse.gov asking President Obama to allow
them to peacefully secede from the union.
The states and their updated totals are:
-
Louisiana, 10,296
-
Texas, 9196
-
Florida, 2392
-
Alabama, 2492
-
North Carolina, 2434
-
Kentucky, 1934
-
Mississippi, 1935
-
Indiana, 1951
-
North Dakota, 881
-
Montana, 1538
-
Colorado, 1805
-
Oregon, 1594
-
New Jersey, 1492
-
New York, 1727
-
South Carolina, 117
-
Arkansas, 86
-
Georgia, 131
-
Missouri, 149
The ability to create the petitions is something
that the Obama administration promised and delivered on because:
We want to hear from you. If a petition
gets enough support, White House staff will review it, ensure its sent
to the appropriate policy experts, and issue an official response.
Any petition requires 25,000 signatures for
consideration. As you can see, in just a few days, Louisiana is halfway to
the necessary total. In order to sign the petition, users simply need to
create a whitehouse.gov account and click sign the petition.
Before anyone begins to cry treason or some
other fear tactic, this is nothing more than an activist tactic (albeit a
very dramatic one) attempting to garner government attention for the state
of the electorate and our nation.
As whitehouse.gov clearly reminds us:
The right to petition your government is
guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. We
the People provides a new way to petition the Obama Administration to
take action on a range of important issues facing our country.
No one is threatening to secede or to wage war
against the United States of America. It is a petition, plain and simple.
But as they say, desperate times call for desperate measures, and clearly
some Americans are feeling the need to make a dramatic noise.
While Louisiana currently leads the
signature count, Texas is a very close second.
The Texas petition reads:
The US continues to suffer economic
difficulties stemming from the federal governments neglect to reform
domestic and foreign spending. The citizens of the US suffer from
blatant abuses of their rights such as the NDAA, the TSA, etc.
Given that the state of Texas maintains a
balanced budget and is the 15th largest economy in the world, it is
practically feasible for Texas to withdraw from the union, and to do so
would protect its citizens standard of living and re-secure their
rights and liberties in accordance with the original ideas and beliefs
of our founding fathers which are no longer being reflected by the
federal government.
I have to admit that this move fascinates me,
and leaves me wondering what may be next. Certainly there have been whispers
and open
talk among political pundits via the news media that a civil war is
imminent.
Retired Army Reserve Colonel Lawrence Sellin writes,
America is on the verge of fragmentation
and civil conflict because its citizens have lost control of their
government and lost faith in its political institutions.
There is no doubt that America is at a
crossroads. Just how we navigate this intersection could well define the
path of the world forever.
UPDATE
Since I wrote this article last night the total
number of states with viewable petitions has increased to 20.
The site requires 150 signatures to be publicly
viewable. In all the number of signatures has gone from 42150 total to 96656
(129%) in about 12 hours over night. Most of that gain has come in the past
few hours however. Currently, the petitions are seeing a cumulative growth
of approximately 7% per hour.
The biggest moves by percentage increase are in
Georgia and South Carolina with some 3000% increase overnight.
The largest numerical increase belongs to Texas
with an 8918 signature jump.
