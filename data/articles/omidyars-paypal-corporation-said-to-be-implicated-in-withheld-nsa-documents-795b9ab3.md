# OmidyarÂ’s PayPal Corporation Said to Be Implicated in Withheld NSA 
Documents

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_nsa66.htm

The
50,000-pages of documents obtained by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden
contain extensive documentation of PayPal Corporation's partnership and
cooperation with the National Security Agency (NSA), according to three
NSA veterans.
To
date, no information has been released as to the extent of the working
relationship and cooperation between the two entities:
What's more, the billionaire owner of PayPal
Corporation has entered into a
$250 Million business partnership
with two journalists, Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, a journalist duo
who possess the entire cache of evidence provided by Edward Snowden.
Despite earlier pledges by the journalists in question,
only one percent
(1%) of Snowden's documents has been released.
BFP (Boiling Frogs Post) was recently contacted by a retired NSA official who claims that the
documents obtained by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden contain extensive
documentation pertaining to NSA's partnership with major U.S. financial
institutions, including credit card companies and PayPal Corporation.
The official, who requested anonymity, also alleges that
a
deal
was made in early June, 2013 between the journalists involved in this
recent NSA scandal and U.S. government officials, which was then sealed
by secrecy and nondisclosure agreements by all parties involved.
Upon receiving this report BFP contacted three other high-level former
NSA officials for additional information and comments.
On December 11, 2013 we contacted Mr. William Binney, a former top
official at the National Security Agency (NSA), and asked him to comment
on the legitimacy of the above report, and whether he had any knowledge
of the partnership and cooperation between NSA and financial
institutions such as PayPal.
He confirmed the legitimacy of the report
and added:
The NSA has had the cooperation of major financial institutions,
including credit card companies, to obtain
all financial
transactions of these companies' clients-international and domestic.
Further, the NSA not only obtains and stores the financial data of
Americans and foreigners, but it also shares them with other
government agencies such as the FBI and DEA.
When asked about the apparent conflict of interest and controversy
involving the new business venture between the journalists in question
and PayPal's billionaire owner Pierre Omidyar, he had the following
statement:
Sunlight, transparency, is the only cure; the only way to bring
about needed changes. This is why the public is entitled to have all
the evidence and documents.
The partnership with PayPal's owner,
thus, the new ownership of Mr. Snowden's documents by an individual
who is implicated in these documents, presents grave concerns and
consequences, and a major conflict of interest for transparency,
integrity and whistleblowers.
Russell Tice, a former NSA Intelligence Analyst
and Capabilities Operations Officer, also confirmed the report, and stated that based on
his knowledge, NSA regularly obtains financial information from major
financial institutions, including credit card companies and PayPal.
In
January 2009, during
an
interview
with Keith Olberman, he stated that information from credit card records
and other financial transaction was being collected and stored by NSA
(below video):
On December 10, 2013, in an exclusive interview with BFP, Mr. Tice
expanded upon the NSA-Financial Institutions collusion:
"For NSA, information from financial institutions such as PayPal is
equally if not more valuable and sought after than that obtained
from social media and other software companies such as Facebook,
Microsoft and Google."
He added,
"I wouldn't doubt the existence of
evidence and documents implicating corporations such as PayPal
within the large cache obtained by Edward Snowden. The partnership
and data collection arrangements have existed for many years."
When asked about his opinion on Glenn Greenwald's new $250 Million
venture partnership with PayPal Corporation's billionaire owner Pierre Omidyar, multi-million dollar book and movie deals, and recent
unexplained immunity from the U.S. government, he stated the following:
"I would be outraged and highly vocal if I were in Edward Snowden's
shoes. For a journalist whom I had placed my trust in to go and
withhold documents meant for the public?!
For the journalist to make
fortune and fame based on my sacrifices and disclosure?! Forming a
lucrative business partnership with entities who have direct
conflicts of interest?! No. That wouldn't have been acceptable."
Despite our submitted requests for confirmation, denial or comments,
PayPal has refrained from responding to this report and contained
allegations.
Other whistleblowers from the intelligence community have also expressed
grave concerns over the serious implications of the recent venture
partnership between journalist Glenn Greenwald and PayPal owner Pierre
Omidyar.
Indeed, the journalists in question have decided to hold back
the release of the remaining 99% of the whistleblower's documents, and
have been inconsistent and vague as to when and how much they intend to
release further documents.
Their decision to withhold the majority of
the documents appears to coincide with their
new
$250 million business venture
with PayPal's Omidyar, and recent
mega-bucks book
and
movie
deals.
Crytome.Org's
John Young, whom we sought comments from for this news story, considers
the claims by these former NSA insiders valid and legitimate:
Government access to financial transactions has always been top
priority for all government agencies, worldwide.
Nothing is more
important to governments than where the money is, especially money
for taxation required to avoid death-stake in the heart of
governments. So it is consistent that NSA (and other spies) have
access to all on- and off-line financial services providers.
As you
know, financial services are required to cooperate with their
governments, perhaps second only to defense industries, perhaps
first due to the need to track worldwide arms sales.
Control of arms
means control of wealth, and nothing is more appreciated by the few
wealthy to offload arms cost to millions of taxpayers.
We asked Mr. Young how he viewed the implications of the same
billionaire who is allegedly implicated in these documents, buying out
the involved reporters (both of them) and getting ownership of the
whistleblower's leaked documents:
Billionaires are as obliged as financial services to cooperate with
governments in order to protect their wealth and to guard against
excessive taxation, expropriation, confiscation, prosecution,
stigmatization and exclusion from government contracts.
Cooperation
with governments is essential for wealth accumulation, the greater
the wealth the greater the cooperation
Whistleblowing on the
whistleblowing industry is overdue,
but that will take courage and ingenuity to avoid appearing to have
been taken over by those expecting to avoid full disclosure.
Here is what WikiLeaks had to
say
about Pierre Omidyar and his PayPal Corporation's war on whistleblowers:
"How can you take something seriously when the person behind this
platform went along with the financial boycott against WikiLeaks?"
Harrison was referring to the decision in December 2010 by PayPal,
which is owned by eBay, to suspend WikiLeaks' donation account and
freeze its assets after pressure from the US government.
The
company's boycott, combined with similar action taken by Visa and Mastercard, left WikiLeaks facing a funding crisis.
"His excuse is probably that there is nothing he could have done at
the time," Harrison continued.
"Well, he is on the board of
directors. He can't shake off responsibility that easily. He didn't
even comment on it. He could have said something like: we were
forced to do this, but I am against it'."
Whistleblower William Russell, who served with the NSA, U.S. Secret
Service, and as an officer and transport pilot with the U.S. Marine
Corps, had the following reaction to this exploitive
PayPal-Journalist-Government collusion:
I completely agree with these whistleblowers. This is a major
conflict of interest and highly convoluted. Omidyar has billions at
stake if the details of his cooperation with government is ever
exposed.
So this guy pays $250 million and buys out the 2
journalists who have the entire cache Simply outrageous!
Sibel Edmonds, the founder and director of National Whistleblowers
Coalition (NSWBC) which represents over 150 government national security
whistleblowers, states:
We have been told that these journalists have had over one hundred
meetings with U.S. government officials in order to clear what
"could be" or "could not be" released. That's a fact, and it is
highly disturbing.
On one hand they say the government considers
these documents and revelations highly classified and stolen
property. Yet, we see a mainstream publisher offering millions of
dollars to the journalist, and getting a go ahead' from the US
government to publish it.
We see a billionaire corporate man, never
known for being pro civil liberties or Human Rights, and someone who
is implicated in these illegal government activities paying off the
journalists and getting ownership of the NSA documents. We see a
government sanctioned Hollywood mega-million movie deal.
We see
lies, inconsistencies, contradictions, censorship, voluntary
withholding, exploitation of a whistleblower
This smoke and
mirrors filled fakery stinks to high heaven!
As
stated
by Guardian's Rusbridger, who recently gave evidence to the British
parliamentary committee about stories based on Snowden's NSA leaks:
Greenwald and the Guardian
had consulted with government officials
and intelligence agencies - including the FBI, GCHQ, the White House
and the Cabinet Office - on more than 100 occasions before
the publication of stories.
The enormous conflict of interest and ethical impropriety of PayPal
owner Omidyar's business venture with Glenn Greenwald, the journalist in
possession of the documents, is not limited to PayPal being directly
implicated in documents exposing NSA's illegal activities and
operations.
There are other equally disturbing and outrageous facts that
put in question the integrity of the journalists, including their sudden
enormous gains, wealth, fame, and the apparent government's consent.
There is
documented evidence
illustrating Pierre Omidyar's historical attitude and position on
publishers, reporters and whistleblowers who publicize incriminating
government documents.
Here is one, coming directly from billionaire Omidyar:
That's right. The above twit was typed by Omidyar's own fingers on July
16, 2009.
But please don't be mistaken. Pierre Omidyar doesn't only talk the talk.
No sir, the man actually walks his talk.
Slightly over a year after Omidyar made the above statement he engaged in the following
action:
NEW YORK
US-based online payment service PayPal has decided to
block financial transfers to WikiLeaks after governments around the
world initiated legal action against the whistleblower website.
"PayPal has permanently restricted the account used by WikiLeaks due
to a violation of the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy, which states
that our payment service cannot be used for any activities that
encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in
illegal activity," PayPal said in statement released late Friday.
Wikileaks was not the only whistleblower entity to fall victim to
PayPal's war on government whistleblowers'.
In 2011, two years after
freezing Wikileaks' account, Omidyar's PayPal cut off the account for
Bradley Manning Support:
Glyn Moody now points us to the news that PayPal has also decided to
cut off the group "Courage to Resist," which was handling funds for
Bradley Manning's defense effort.
PayPal admits there's no legal
basis for this. Apparently, the company just doesn't believe that
some people should be allowed a fair trial.
The report also notes that they've had a PayPal account in good
standing since 2006, with no problems at all. It's only once they
were taking funds for Bradley Manning that PayPal shut them down.
This is somewhat horrifying, frankly, and raises serious questions
about PayPal as a business worth trusting.
Then, yet another recent example of violations inflicted by PayPal, this
time
upon Mailpile.
Mailpile attempted to create a webmail client that is built with both
security and usability in mind to counter government's intrusions into
hosted webmail accounts:
PayPal, for reasons known only to PayPal, has decided to
freeze their funds and won't let Mailpile access the money that
people donated
PayPal is demanding an insane level of detail into Mailpile's
personal finances and business... Even worse, it seems
that the folks at PayPal recognize that it holds power over
Mailpile, and seems almost to be lording that power over them
The history of the billionaire's stand and actions, when it comes to
liberties, whistleblowers and freedom of the press, seems to be limited
to:
opposing, fighting and quashing government whistleblowers at every
chance.
Simply put, Mr. Omidyar has been consistently maintaining his
stand as a billionaire who is,
Omidyar's pro government and anti-whistleblowers philosophy and
principles are shared equally when it comes to his partners and close
associates.
Here is Mr. Omidyar's PayPal Partner and close friend Max Levchin, who
says
that the NSA isn't being evil, and that the agency's violation is for
our own good and protection from terrorists:
The NSA is designed to protect us from terrorism, so even if it
oversteps its bounds, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin says we
shouldn't hate it.
That's diametrically opposed to the sentiment of
many in the tech industry, including Michael Arrington who thinks
the NSA's spying doesn't stop terrorism -
it is terrorism.
"I think it's ridiculous for a citizen of a country that view his
government's duty to protect me, protect all of us from evil, from
harm, from terrorists, from foreign powers meaning ill - to classify
a body of government that is designed to figure out what might hit
us next and prevent it, throwing them into an evil bucket is just
thoughtless."
Let's watch Pierre Omidyar's PayPal partner and close friend in action,
shall we?
PayPal Co-Founder Defends NSA Surveillance
This interview was conducted in the summer of 2013.
This was right in
the midst of the Edward Snowden and NSA Scandal. This is what Pierre
Omidyar and his closest friend and PayPal partner believed then. And
this is what they believe now. There has been no change either in
Omidyar's or his partner's position and belief since. There has been
zero indication of either of them seeing the light called civil
liberties.
PayPal co-founder Max Levchin is not the only PayPal man who is pro-NSA
illegal surveillance and corporate-government partnerships in targeting
the population at large.
Here are
other PayPal Men
and former partners who have been directly linked to government spying
and surveillance operations, and of course, the CIA:
Palantir Technologies, a Silicon Valley firm, is, according to the
tipster, providing the technology that enables the mass-surveillance
NSA project known as
PRISM.
Palantir (which, at time of writing, had not responded to requests
for comment) was founded in 2004 by, among others, venture
capitalist Peter Thiel and CEO Alex Karp. It's a sort of
second-party data intelligence company - it's not a public company,
but it was founded with early investment from the CIA and is heavily
used by the military and the
White House.
Karp is an ex-PayPal guy, and leveraged his expertise in security he
gained at PayPal (which was constantly fighting off hackers) into
his new venture.
Here is more on this
CIA
Company
and its originators, all from PayPal's early days:
Palantir's advisors include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director
George Tenet, who says in an interview that,
"I wish we had a tool of
its power" before 9/11. General David Petraeus, the most recent
former CIA chief, describes Palantir to FORBES as "a better
mousetrap when a better mousetrap was needed"
We must not forget PayPal's position and its actual business goals.
PayPal is an international e-commerce business allowing payments and
money transfers to be made through the Internet. It operates in 190
markets and manages more than 232 million accounts, more than 100
million of them active. PayPal allows customers to send, receive, and
hold funds in 26 currencies worldwide.
It is subject to the US economic
sanction list and subject to other rules and interventions required by
US laws or the government.
All that, and the fact that PayPal has always
been a valuable asset and partner of the U.S. government, even when it
comes to operations directed against the people's rights and privacy.
Remember, NSA wants access to our data. All data. Based on the latest
revelations we already
know
that:
"Companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft - they all get
together with the NSA and provide the NSA with direct access to the
backends to all of the systems you use to communicate, to store your
data, to put things in the cloud, and even just to send birthday
wishes and keep a record of your life.
And they give the NSA direct
access that they don't need to oversee, so they can't be held liable
for it."
So far, Greenwald and the rest of the mainstream media have been
emphasizing a handful of company names valuable to the NSA as great
sources of data gathering on individuals - companies and organizations
such as,
Now think about
it, if NSA is that interested in garbage personal details we post on
Facebook, how interested would it be in a far more telling database such
as PayPal, where it can get all our expenditures, money transfers,
payments and donations?
Prior to Snowden revelations we had NSA's easy access to and control of
telecommunication companies such as AT&T and Verizon.
Recently, based on
less than 1% of Snowden's documents we became aware of NSA's incestuous
partnership with social media and software companies such as Facebook,
Google, Microsoft and Apple.
We still don't have access to 99% of Snowden's NSA documents and
revelations. Obviously the 50,000+ page documentations includes many
other companies and organizations, including those in possession of the
public's financial transaction data. We are talking credit card
companies and other related financial institutions. More importantly, we
are talking about one of the world's largest online money transfer
entities, PayPal Corporation.
Thus, we all should be alarmed when we see that those implicated in the
whistleblower's documented evidence are now forming a multi-million
dollar business venture with those in possession of that evidence.
We
all must question the unexplained changes in the U.S. government's
position on the ownership and publication of these documents. We must
all be wary when we see how readily mainstream publishers and Hollywood
studios are signing up to publicize these documents and the case with
some unexplained immunity.
We have to ask ourselves: what has changed?
What gives?
Only a few months ago there was all this talks about
apprehension, jailing, hanging and droning of all parties involved. Only
a few months ago the parties involved put on a magnificent show on how
they were threatened, endangered, and were going to be persecuted and
prosecuted.
Then, suddenly, something changed. Something gave.
-
Was it a
secret deal struck between the government and the involved parties
establishing immunity and support in return for something much more
cynical and dark?
-
Was it the involved parties using the cache as a
blackmailing tool to secure a $250 million payoff?
-
Was it a solemn oath
to withhold and never release the real' deal in return for a glamorous
life with Hollywood studio deals and multi-million dollar book
contracts?
-
Which one is it?
We have no way of knowing, since lips seem to have been
sealed, and the release of the real' documents has been vaguely put on
hold for years to come. On the other hand, thanks to some real'
whistleblowers out there, we are getting some information putting this
smoke and mirrors filled stage into perspective.
Even if so far we have
gotten to see only the tip of this convoluted and corrupted iceberg.
