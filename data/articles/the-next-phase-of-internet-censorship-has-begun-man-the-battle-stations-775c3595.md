Reports pertaining to the censorship and
takedown of personal websites continue to flood in.
First,
YouTube meddled with the view counts of folks like Alex Jones over at
Info Wars and Prison Planet. Then
Flickr,
MySpace and
Facebook began
censoring comments and material.
Now an increasing number of independent online
media are beginning to feel the sharp edge of the blade.
Amazon & Wikileaks
When Wikileaks went under fire for its publication of material such as the
quarter million diplomatic cables (or Pentagon Papers 2),
Amazon decided to
pull the plug on its service to the whistleblower website.
Subsequently, we found out that the
CEO and founder of Amazon attended the
most recent
Bilderberg Group meeting in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
Is it any wonder that Amazon too has joined the bandwagon?
Average Joes who
shot to fame and fortune, respective business empire founders such as Jeff Bezos
and
Bill Gates, have been enticed by the club of good old boys and
awoken that innate and evil human desire to play God with the rest of us.
This author was responsible for the Wikileaks
publication of the few
Bilderberg meeting documents available a week before their meet in Greece of
2009.
They had been obtained from the author of
Illuminati Conspiracy
Archive, whose website seems to have become now defunct. Apparently, they
had floated around on the net some years before, to have been taken down,
and this author figured it wise to republish the few documents available to
aid research.
A final disclaimer on the subject of Wikileaks
This author believes Wikileaks to be a US Government con job.
Esteemed analyst William Engdahl
has
written extensively on this topic. Engdahl points out how no document
released really told us anything we did not already know. In actuality,
every document supported the Pentagon agenda in the Middle East and
elsewhere. No mention of
September 11th, 2001 or the banks (how convenient
that got deleted!).
Daniel Estulin of Bilderberg fame has also recently published a book on
the deceptive nature of Wikileaks and its use as a tool of disinformation, the
results of which we are now witnessing.
He has contact with KGB intelligence and reports
that it is likely Assange was recruited by numerous intelligence agencies.
He asks the questions on Assange's origins, where did he come from? It is
also interesting that he supposedly got caught
hacking the Pentagon in the
1990s.
This is a serious offense, for him to walk free
of this, well, you can guess what the trade-off might have been.
Founder of
Cryptome (John Young) worked with Wikileaks in its infancy and
left after growing suspicion. He cites big money such as
Soros and CIA.
There is no other way Assange could have become so popular, so fast, and
promoted by virtually all mainstream media without the assistance of this
network.
Ultimately, Wikileaks serves as the trojan horse and Julian Assange as
the
scapegoat for crackdown on the internet.
After all, it was Joe Lieberman
(below video) who
declared the American and Chinese models must converge, the U.S.
must be allowed total control and censorship of the internet just like our
Asian partners.
Hence, his call to Bilderberg's Amazon for
censorship of the false flag Wikileaks operation.
Dont Tread on Me
A few weeks ago, Silver Shields popular economic and political commentary
blog had been
hacked.
He has been wildly popular with his Sons of Liberty
Academy and drive to make people aware of the true nature of the monetary
system, suggesting the purchase of physical silver as one way to be free of
the false paradigm.
A similar hack had also been perpetrated against
Freedom
Force International a few years ago.
SGT Report & Bank of America
Just recently,
SGT Report, who provides excellent economic reality and
freedom related reporting, had been subjected to COINTELPRO commentary
assault by the Wall Street-Pentagon nexus which includes Bank of America.
See the site editors excellent detective work
at below video:
Activist Post & Google via Blogger
The excellent
Activist Post, to which
Global Governance Archive is a
frequent contributor, seems to have just been taken down by Google-owned
Blogger (below video).
Recall that Google CEO Eric Schmidt also attended the last
Bilderberg meeting
(below video).
Rick Rozoff (Stop NATO) & WordPress
The website of important analyst Rick Rozoff,
Stop NATO, has now
been
threatened by WordPress, who seems also to have taken to the chopping block.
Yahoo & the Day of Rage
Finally, we have
Yahoo censoring the Day of Rage attempts to coordinate
their occupation of Wall Street.
Full Spectrum Dominance
This
insane Pentagon doctrine seeks to dominate land, air, sea, outer space,
inner space and cyber space.
It seeks "informational superiority" which is
defined as,
"the capability to collect, process and
disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while exploiting or
denying adversary's ability to do the same."
Prepare for the Cyber
False Flag
Corporate interests have been co-opted by the global elites and their secret
societies.
Bilderberg 2011 saw the coming together of
Google,
Facebook, LinkedIn and Amazon, among others. We are now only
beginning to witness the outcome of their policy agenda.
Companies are being
bought up and merged by the new world elites, with,
As the few, the wise, those that enter through the narrow gate have long
been warning and preparing for such issues as food storage, survivalism and
spiritual preparedness, our essential lines of communication are gradually
being cut.
Skynet is becoming self-aware. Take all
preventative measures and bat down the hatches. There be a storm on the horizon.
Godspeed...
