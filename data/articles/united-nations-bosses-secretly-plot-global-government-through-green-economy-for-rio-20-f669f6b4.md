# United Nations Bosses Secretly Plot Global Government through "Green 
Economy" for Rio+20

The closed-door session, held last October
in Long Island, focused mainly on using the
upcoming UN Conference on Sustainable Development (UN CSD) in Rio de
Janeiro to dramatically change the world under the guise of saving
the environment. And all of the global bodys top "green" officials were
in attendance to help formulate the plan.
The confidential minutes of the meeting,
obtained and
posted online by Fox News last week, outline the goals and agenda
for the global sustainability gathering this June - dubbed Rio+20 - that
will be held on the 20th anniversary of the 1992 Earth Summit.
Using
environmentalism as the rationale, that conference laid the
groundwork for the global effort the UN hopes to expand and solidify
in the years to come.
According to critics and the UN itself,
however, the global body and its allies around the world have ambitions
that go far beyond simply protecting the environment.
In fact, many
experts - especially in the United States -
fear that the UN actually envisions a global government, an erosion
of private-property rights, and even an end to the individual freedoms
enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. And based on UN documents dealing
with "sustainability," the concerns appear to be justified.
During the secretive October meeting on
sustainability, attended by the leaders of the United Nations System
Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), Secretary General Ban
made more than a few bold statements.
He said, for example, that
pursuing "sustainable development" was the,
"greatest imperative of the
current generation of leadership, as well as of UN system
organizations," according to the minutes.
Top Rio+20 official and UN Under-Secretary
General Sha Zukang, who served as a senior diplomat with the brutal
communist dictatorship ruling mainland China for nearly four decades,
also laid out a grandiose agenda for the worlds future.
In recent
weeks, he has even been making public statements
demanding "strong decisions" and "strong actions" from national
governments participating in the Rio+20 summit.
According to the
minutes of the secret
meeting, Sha stressed that the main objective of the conference will be
to solidify support from governments around the world in the global
pursuit of "sustainable development." That, he noted, will require the
erection of an "institutional framework" - otherwise known as the global
enforcement bureaucracies to mandate compliance by the worlds national
governments and populations.
Another top priority will be the global
transition toward a so-called "green economy," he said. The new economic
order envisioned by the global body would prioritize what the UN touts
as "poverty eradication," "equality," and more.
But the implementation
of the highly controversial "Agenda
21" plan needs to continue full speed ahead as well, Sha noted.
"On the green economy theme, [Sha] stated
that Rio+20 should be the catalyst to integrate the economic, social and
environmental pillars of sustainable developments, energize
implementation of the sustainable development agenda, and lead to
coherent policies and programs at all levels - integration,
implementation and coherence," the leaked summary of the meeting
explained.
While acknowledging that there was
considerable disagreement on what a "green economy" actually represents, Sha and others at the meeting suggested using the UN CSD in Rio to first
decide what it was not.
That, he said, would help define what it "could
be."
"[The green economy] should re-orient public
and private decision making to reflect and respect natural capital,
synergize growth and environment protection, and include the poor as
main beneficiaries, as well as active participants in building such a
green economy," Sha explained according to the meeting minutes, though
he admitted there was no real or accepted definition.
The former representative of Beijings
murderous regime also said that the Rio+20 conference should produce a
list of "sustainable development goals" for national, regional, and
global policy-makers to help them implement the policies being sought.
Authority, meanwhile, would need to steadily gravitate toward regional
and global entities as local and national governments are "integrated"
into the world system.
Science and education, meanwhile, must be "at the
service of sustainability."
Among the top priorities cited by Sha were
"combating poverty," creating so-called green jobs, "sustainable
agriculture," promotion of "renewable" energy, "management of oceans,"
and more.
And while most of those goals seem innocuous at first, critics
warn that unforeseen dangers lurk behind the innocent-sounding
terminology.
Also on Shas wish list was what the minutes
identified as "sustainable human settlements." This
concept in particular has attracted a barrage of criticism -
especially in America - by a broad array of experts concerned about
individual liberty, property rights, and national sovereignty.
According to critics, who base their
opposition to the schemes on the content of UN documents, so-called
"sustainable" settlements would involve cramming people into compact
"human habitation zones."
Much of the world would be off limits to
people. The small areas permitted for use by humanity, meanwhile, would
be tightly regulated. And consumption would also be severely
restricted.
Other key points made during the meeting
included the idea of creating a sort of "State of the Planet" update
each year. Also on the agenda: "the need for a narrative about planetary
responsibility and the UN role," the minutes explained.
Top Rio+20 summit organizer Brice Lalonde, a
socialist activist and former Green Party leader who served as the
French Environment Minister, proposed trying to market the conference
and the UN as,
"the voice of the planet and its people."
And those people
must start to think differently:
"A conceptual move was needed towards
much more redistribution and much more equity around the world, i.e. One
Planet," Lalonde told participants as summarized in the leaked document.
The minutes also noted that some governments
ruling developing countries - mostly corrupt dictatorships enabled by
the UN and foreign aid from rich countries - were still suspicious of
the "sustainable development" agenda.
But that should not be a problem;
according to the summary document, they would be receiving plenty of
"development assistance" to ensure that the benefits of supporting the
scheme were fully understood.
One participant in the closed meetings,
International Labor Organization boss Juan Somavia, articulated a plot
to help the UN achieve its goals at a conference in 2015.
The idea would be to establish a "People's
Summit" - which, the minutes explained, would be "set around a basic
agreement negotiated in advance" - to ensure that the population felt a
sense of "ownership."
Then, the UN could push societies and national
governments into compliance more forcefully, the minutes noted.
Also discussed at the meeting was the global
economic crisis and how it could be used to advance the broader UN
agenda. Senior CEB staffer and International Monetary Fund insider
Elliot Harris, supposedly an economist educated in Germany, told
participants that more central planning was needed to achieve UN goals.
Citing a report prepared for the CEB, Harris
explained that the crisis offered the UN and other world institutions a
chance to deal with globalization using a,
"renewed recognition of the role of the
State" and "an appreciation of the value of collective and
coordinated action at the global level."
And because of globalization, a planetary
"coherent economic system" and global policies are called for, he
claimed.
Centralized world control of everything from
education and health to economic policy and environmental protection -
all based on UN values with enforced compliance - would also be needed,
he explained, citing the report.
Many meeting participants
wholeheartedly agreed.
UN Environment Program boss Achim Steiner,
who moderated much of the meeting, called on attendees to take action
and provide feedback on the report to,
"help the system rally around an agenda
that guaranteed the future of the UN."
He also noted that the document and
participants comments were not intended to be made public.
Secretary General Ban then concluded by
touting the "historic opportunity" to rally the world toward UN goals,
saying the lack of public trust in government needed to be overcome.
Participants should seize the "unique opportunity" to re-shape the
world, he said - not only for the benefit of his legacy, but for the
aggrandizement of the entire UN and all of its minions.
American critics, on the other hand, hope
people will see through the UN's machinations and demand a complete U.S.
withdrawal from the dangerous global body and its ever-expanding
tentacles.
