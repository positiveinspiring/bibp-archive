The world is on the brink of a fresh currency
war, Russia warned, as European policy makers joined Japan in bemoaning the
economic cost of rising exchange rates.
Japan is weakening the yen and other
countries may follow,
Alexei Ulyukayev, first deputy chairman of Russias central bank,
said at a conference today in Moscow.
The push
for weaker currencies is being driven by a need
to find new
sources of economic growth as monetary
and fiscal
policies run out of room.

and this week touched its lowest level
in two years.

The alert from the country that chairs the Group
of 20 came as Luxembourg Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker complained of a dangerously high euro and
officials in
Norway and Sweden expressed
exchange-rate concern.
The push for weaker currencies is being driven
by a need to find new sources of economic growth as monetary and fiscal
policies run out of room.
The risk is as each country tries to boost
exports, it hurts the competitiveness of other economies and provokes
retaliation.
Yesterday will go down as the first day
European policy makers fired a shot in the 2013 currency war, said
Chris
Turner, head of foreign-exchange strategy at ING Groep NV in London.
G-20 Clash
The skirmish may lead to a clash of G-20 finance
ministers and central banks when they meet next month in Moscow, three
months after reiterating their 2009 pledge to refrain from competitive
devaluation of currencies.
While
emerging markets have repeatedly complained about strong currencies as a
result of easy monetary policies in the west, the engagement of richer
nations is adding a new dimension to what Brazilian Finance Minister
Guido
Mantega first dubbed a currency war in 2010.
After Switzerland blocked the francs
appreciation against the euro since September 2011, Japan has reignited the
latest round of rhetoric as newly elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
campaigns to spur growth via a more aggressive central bank. The yen has
slid 11 percent against the dollar since December and this week touched its
lowest level in two years.
Now other policy makers are speaking out.
Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said yesterday
that the euros 7 percent gain against the dollar in the past six months
poses a fresh threat to the European economy just as it shows signs of
escaping its three-year debt crisis.
No Concern
While the euro fell, the power of his words may
be limited by signals from the
European Central Bank that it isnt prepared to favor a weaker currency.
ECB President Mario
Draghi last week said he has no goal for the exchange rate, although he
noted the euro was trading at its long-run average.
The euro exchange rate is not a major concern,
ECB council member Ewald
Nowotny told reporters in Vienna today.
For us, the exchange rate of the euro is one
variable to be factored in, but isnt a goal in itself, ECB Executive Board
member Peter Praet told La Libre Belgique newspaper in an interview
published today.
Still, economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and
Citigroup Inc. (C) said in reports today that a further strengthening of
the euro could eventually help trigger an
interest-rate cut from the ECB.
Negative Impacts
In Norway, Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen
said in an interview that a strong krone challenges the economy and that the
government must ease pressure on the Norges Bank to avoid krone
strengthening by conducting a tight fiscal policy.
Norges Bank Deputy
Governor Jan F. Qvigstad said yesterday that if the krone remains strong
until policy makers meet in March,
that of course has an obvious effect on
the interest rate.
That pushed the currency, which has emerged as a
haven from the European crisis, to its lowest level in more than two months
versus the euro.
Meantime, Riksbank Deputy Governor Lars E. O. Svensson said today that a strong Swedish krona would be yet another
reason to lower borrowing costs. He last month argued for a deeper cut than
the 0.25 percentage point move to 1 percent that colleagues supported.
Its obvious that the economy would manage
better in this very difficult, weak economy with a lower rate and a weaker
krona, Svensson said in Stockholm.
Adverse Effects
Elsewhere, Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo
said Jan. 14 that a steep drop in the yen could provoke an,
active response
to minimize any negative impacts on exports and investor confidence.
Vice
Finance Minister Shin Je Yoon said today that South
Korea wants the G-20 talks in Moscow to focus on adverse effects of
monetary easing in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
If Japan continues to pursue a softer currency,
reciprocal devaluations would hurt the global economy, Russias Ulyukayev
said today. That echoes recent concern from other international policy
chiefs.
Federal
Reserve
Bank of St. Louis President
James
Bullard said Jan. 10 that hes a little disturbed by Japans stance
and the risk of beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor
Glenn
Stevens said Dec. 12 that there is a,
degree of disquiet in the global
policy- making community, while Bank
of England Governor
Mervyn
King said Dec. 10 that he worried well see the growth of actively
managed exchange rates.
