Chief Executive's Council
of International Advisors
The establishment of the Chief Executive's Council of International Advisers (CECIA) was announced in the 1998 Policy Address. The CECIA advises the Chief Executive from an international perspective on strategic issues pertinent to the long-term development of Hong Kong. In particular, the Advisers are invited to advise on how global and regional trends might affect Hong Kong's development, how the international business community perceives Hong Kong's plans and programmes of activities, as well as what measures Hong Kong should take to enhance its role as a world-class commercial and financial centre and as a dynamic Special Administrative Region of China under the concept of "One Country, Two Systems".
The CECIA is chaired by the Chief Executive and has 19 non-official members, all of whom are prominent international business and corporate leaders. The Chief Secretary for Administration, Financial Secretary, Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology and Head of the Central Policy Unit are ex-officio members.
The CECIA meets once a year. The inaugural, second and third meetings were held on 20 January 1999, 17 November 1999, and 30 November 2000 respectively. Issues discussed in the previous meetings included Asia's adjustment to the financial turmoil, improving Hong Kong's competitiveness as well as opportunities and challenges for Hong Kong after China's accession to the World Trade Organisation . The fourth meeting was held on 8 November 2001. Council members discussed the implications of the global economic situation on Hong Kong's economy and strategies for strengthening the economic ties with the Pearl River Delta.
