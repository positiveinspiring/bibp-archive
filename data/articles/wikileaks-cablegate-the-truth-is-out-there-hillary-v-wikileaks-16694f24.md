With a
steady trickle of Diplomatic communiqu√©s leaking out every single day, the
Book of Revelations is expanding dramatically. In all the hubbub, the global
community is forced to ask questions of its leaders.

leader, the elusive Julian Assange, whose impact on the global scene is
testing the limits of freedom of the press.
-
How will governmental
representatives from North America, Europe and the Middle East react to

-

Blue Beam Psi-Ops

MK Ultra, the
Rhodes Scholars and the
TriLateral
Commission?
-
Will the world ever be the same again?
Join your affable host
Robert Foster, as he executes a rhyme inquisition on some of the key players
in the Wiki-saga.
