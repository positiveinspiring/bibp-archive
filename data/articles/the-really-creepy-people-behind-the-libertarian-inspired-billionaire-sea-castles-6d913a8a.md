The stinking rich are planning billion-dollar luxury liners that keep the
land-based Americans they've plundered at a safe distance.
-
What happens when Americans plunder
America and leave it broken, destitute and seething mad?
-
Where do these fabulously wealthy
Americans go with their loot, if America isn't a safe, secure, or
even desirable place to spend their riches?
-
What if they lose faith in their gated
communities, because those plush gated communities are surrounded by
millions of pissed-off Americans stripped of their entitlements, and
who now want in?
We finally have the answer, and you're not going
to like it:
a new fleet of castles that float in the
oceans.
The super-wealthy are already building their
first floating castle, a billion-dollar-plus luxury liner that offers
permanent multimillion-dollar housing with the best protection of all:
moats made of oceans, keeping the land-based
Americans they've plundered at a safe distance.
The first such floating castle has been
christened the "Utopia" - the South Korean firm Samsung has been
contracted to build the $1.1 billion ship, due to be launched in 2013.
Already orders are coming in to buy one of the
Utopia's 200 or so mansions for sale - which range in price from about $4
million for the smallest condos to over $26 million for 6,600 square-foot
"estates."
The largest mansion is a whopping 40,000 square
feet, and sells for $160 million.
It's the first of its kind to offer permanent housing units to buyers, and
there'll be plenty on board the Utopia for
the
global elite inhabitants to keep themselves entertained: an
outdoor movie theater, casino, miniature golf course, nightclubs,
restaurants, shops, and a water park for the elites' heirs (featuring a
"Lazy River," rock-climbing wall and water slides).
At nearly 1,000 feet, the Utopia is almost as
long as a nuclear-powered Nimitz-class aircraft carrier.
The floating castle is a longtime dream of libertarian oligarchs - a
place where they can live their lives in peace free from the teeming masses
of starving losers and indebted parasites and their tax demands.
Since theyve grown so rich off of America, they
have enough spare change to fund projects like the
Seasteading Institute, run by
Milton Friedman's grandson, Patri
Friedman, and financed by the bizarre right-wing PayPal founder,
Peter Thiel.
It couldn't have come a moment sooner for Milton
Friedman's grandson, who was best known until recently for running a
grotesque advice blog for married swingers, PUA4LTR (Pick
Up Advice For Long-Term Relationships).
Actually, Patri Friedman ran that pick-up
advice blog with his wife - the two of them are apparent big-time
cyber-swingers, apparently -
posting blog entries saying things like,
"Why Should Husbands Become PUAs? Because
otherwise, your wife will talk like those wives on the blog My Husband
Is Annoying."
Both Thiel and Milton Friedman's grandson see
democracy as the enemy - last year, Thiel wrote,
"I no longer believe that freedom and
democracy are compatible" at about the same time that Milton Friedman's
grandson proclaimed, "Democracy is not the answer."
Both published their anti-democracy
proclamations in the same billionaire-Koch-family-funded outlet,
Cato Unbound, one of the oldest billionaire-fed libertarian
welfare dispensaries.
Friedman's answer for Thiel's democracy problem
is to build offshore libertarian pod-fortresses where the libertarian way
rules.
It's probably better for everyone if Milton
Friedman's grandson and Peter Thiel leave us forever for their libertarian
ocean lair - Thiel believes that America went down the tubes ever since it
gave women the right to vote, and he was
ousted as the sponsor of accused felon
James O'Keefe's smear videos that brought
ACORN to ruin.
While Thiel and Friedman are busy cooking up their libertarian dystopia, the
Frontier Group investment firm - an
offshoot of the
Carlyle Group
- has already entered the realization phase with the
Utopia floating castle.
Frontier Group, was founded by some of
the same big names from the notorious Carlyle Group - the private equity
firm that brought together right-wing oligarchs like
George H. W. Bush and other top American officials
with their billionaire pals in Saudi Arabia like the Bin Laden family,
who together raked in enormous profits thanks to the
War
on Terror that their kids Dubya and Osama launched.
While neither Bush nor the Bin Ladens are principals in the Frontier Group,
its founding director,
Frank Carlucci, is a name they know
well, and you should too.
Carlucci ran
the
Carlyle Group as its chairman from 1989 through 2005, right
around the time that the wars started going undeniably bad, and floating
castles started to look like a viable plan.
But Carlucci's past is much weirder and scarier
than most of us care to know:
whether it's his strangely timed appearances
in some of the ugliest assassinations and coups in modern history, or
serving as Carter's number two man in the CIA, and Ronald Reagan's
Secretary of Defense, if Frank Carlucci (nicknamed "Creepy Carlucci" and
"Spooky Frank") is the founding director of a firm that's building floating
castles, it's a bad sign for those of us left behind.
***
I'll get into Carlucci's partners in the
Frontier Group in a moment, but first, let's reacquaint ourselves with
Frank Carlucci.
From an early age, Carlucci learned the
importance of getting to know the right people in the right places. He
studied at Princeton in the mid-1950s, where as luck should have it,
Carlucci roomed with Donald Rumsfeld.
Both Carlucci and Rumsfeld shared a passion for
Greco-Roman wrestling at Princeton, and both went on to serve in the Navy
after Princeton.
Their paths would split and merge several times
over the next few decades, even as they remained close personal friends
throughout their lives. In the late 1950s, Carlucci briefly served as an
executive at a lingerie manufacturer, Jantzen (the Victoria's Secret
of its day), but quickly left to join the State Department.
At age 30 Carlucci was named vice consul of the U.S. embassy in the Congo -
just in time for the colony's independence from Belgium.
Of all the European
colonies in Africa, Congo suffered perhaps the worst, at least that we know
about:
the Belgians exterminated up to 10 million Congolese between 1885 and
1908, and introduced the now-widespread punishment of hacking off Africans'
forearms to scare everyone into submission.
All of this was done in order to strip the Congo
of its lucrative rubber, ivory, and later, precious metals, as quickly as
possible, and send the riches back to Belgium.
Naturally the Belgians didn't want to let go of their colony, so they held
out until 1960, when the Congo finally was granted independence and
democratic elections.
Unfortunately for the Congo, America didn't like way
they voted - so two months after Patrice Lumumba was elected
president, he was overthrown in a CIA-backed coup, taken out into the
jungle, murdered, chopped into little pieces with a hacksaw, and then
dissolved in sulfuric acid.
Carlucci has been accused of green-lighting
Lumumba's assassination by
multiple investigative reporters.
The dictator who replaced Lumumba was a CIA asset named Joseph Mobutu
- the notorious dictator who brought the Congo to ruin after embezzling more
than any dictator in Africa. Mobutu was finally deposed in 1997, but the
wars since then have claimed roughly six million lives, the bloodiest
conflicts since World War II.
After his success in Congo, it was all
uphill for Carlucci: he moved to the Brazil
embassy just in time for the military coup in 1964, then went to Washington
to serve as deputy to his buddy Donald Rumsfeld in Nixon's Office of
Economic Opportunity, where the young Dick Cheney was making his
name.
The first thing they did upon taking control of
the OEO was conduct a purge of "subversives" firing up to a quarter of the
staff.
In 1974, Carlucci was named ambassador to
Portugal just in time for the overthrow of the dictatorship -
Carlucci saw to it that the communists who led the overthrow were themselves
overthrown by IMF-friendly "moderate" socialists, and a few years later, he
was back in Washington serving as the number two man in the CIA under
Carter.
Once that agency was sufficiently gutted, he moved on to other forms of
destruction: In 1974, Carlucci was named ambassador to Portugal just in time
for the overthrow of the dictatorship - Carlucci saw to it that the
Communists who led the overthrow were themselves overthrown by IMF-friendly
"moderate" socialists, and a few years later, he was back in Washington DC
serving as the number two man in the CIA under Carter.
In 1981, Reagan named him deputy Defense
Secretary; Carlucci left in 1983 to head up Sears World Trade, a
trading company involved in shady arms deals that was once described by
Fortune magazine as a front for US intelligence ops.
Once that
collapsed, Carlucci moved back to the Reagan Administration as National
Security Advisor and then Defense Secretary.
In 1989, Carlucci left to become chairman of the fledging Carlyle Group,
which subsequently morphed into the monster we remember it by:
using its highly paid A-list of public
officials to lobby big government for lucrative contracts, profiting off
of privatized rest stops and unnecessary arms contracts, leaving the
public to foot the bill while guys like Carlucci run around preaching
the benefits of private enterprise.
Carlucci may be the scariest of the Frontier
Group bunch building the floating castles, but he's among his kind.
Other Carlyle Group directors who joined
Carlucci at Frontier include:
-
David Robb, who headed up Carlyle's
investments in defense and aerospace
-
Sanford McDonnell, the former CEO of
McDonnell Douglass and onetime head of the Boy Scouts of America
-
Norman Augustine, another ex-president
of the Boy Scouts, another Princeton alum, and former board director
at the
scandal-plagued Riggs bank
Riggs Bank became one of those dark
unsolved mysteries of the Bush-Cheney War on Terror.
After the
attacks on 9/11, the FBI discovered that Saudi government
officials used accounts at Riggs bank to wire funds to at least two known
associates of the Saudi hijackers who crashed Flight 77 into the Pentagon.
Riggs was also implicated in the Britain-Saudi
$3 billion bribery scandal, in which British Aerospace bribes were wired
through Riggs accounts to Saudi officials in return for lucrative contracts.
One of Riggs bank's top executives was Jonathan Bush, the brother
of George H. W. Bush, after Riggs bought out Jonathan Bush's bank in
1997, and appointed him as a director.
In 2005, with Riggs embroiled in
investigations and scandals - Riggs pled guilty to money laundering
Augusto Pinochet's stolen funds, and the funds of various Equatorial
Guinea officials - it was taken over by PNC bank, with the approval of
Fed Chair Alan Greenspan. Even after the Washington Post revealed that
Riggs' billionaire chairman flew Greenspan's wife, MSNBC anchor Andrea
Mitchell, on the company jet.
But the weirdest of all the Frontier Group directors has to be founding
director
Danny Pang.
Last year, the Wall Street Journal
reported that Pang embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars from his
private equity firm PEMGroup.
Pang claimed he was investing money in "Dead
Peasants Insurance" (life insurance policies for people considered likely to
die), but in secret, Pang confided to PEMGroup's ex-president that he ran it
as a
Ponzi scheme.
That sparked a fresh FBI investigation into
Danny Pang's crimes - which led back to the unsolved murder of his wife,
Janie Louise Pang, a 33-year-old ex-stripper who was shot to death
execution style in their Irvine, California home in 1997, the same year
Pang was accused of embezzling three million dollars from another fund he
worked at.
There was plenty of reason to suspect Danny Pang
of murdering his wife:
he beat her so often (breaking her nose on
one occasion) that police were called in on at least four occasions
before her murder.
She'd had him tailed by a private detective who
discovered Danny holding hands with another woman shortly before she was
murdered.
Danny had known ties to the Taiwanese Triad
mob, he took the fifth and refused to cooperate in the murder trial, and
reportedly threatened Janie's friends after her murder, demanding to know
what Janie told them about his business activities.
Here is a description of the actual murder, from
the L.A. Times:
According to the family maid and two of
Pang's children, a clean-cut man with a pencil-thin mustache arrived at
the door asking for her husband. The pair talked casually for a couple
of minutes, until the man drew a semiautomatic pistol.
Pang began running and the maid, terrified,
spirited Pang's children out the back door. Within minutes, the killer
caught up with Pang, who tried to hide in her bedroom closet. The killer
fired several .380-caliber rounds and left her to bleed to death as she
lay in a fetal position.
Somehow, the trial ended with a hung jury, and
Danny Pang went on to join Frank Carlucci and the Boy Scouts presidents to
start building the world's first billion-dollar floating castle to spirit
away all that stolen money in luxury.
But Pang was apparently too careless for them.
He was ousted last spring in the Wall Street Journal, and in
September 2009, Danny Pang was found dead of unknown causes in his
Newport Beach home.
After a three-month investigation, Pang's death
was ruled a suicide:
John C. Hiserodt, a private forensic
pathologist in Cypress, Calif., reviewed the toxicology report released
by the coroner.
He said it showed that Mr. Pang had roughly five times
the typical fatal levels of both oxycodone and hydrocodone in his blood,
plus the equivalent still in his stomach of about 30 oxycodone pills of
10 milligrams apiece.
"You don't get this level of drug
accidentally," he said. "It's pretty clearly a suicide."
Meanwhile, plans to launch the Utopia are
moving ahead on schedule.
