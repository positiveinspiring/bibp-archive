The evidence was crucial because it undermined
the official explanation that Hani Hanjour crashed American Airlines
Flight 77 into the Pentagon at high speed after executing an extremely
difficult top gun maneuver.
But to understand how all of this played out,
let us review the case in bite-size pieces...
In August 2004 when the 9/11 Commission completed its official investigation
of the September 11, 2001 attack, the commission transferred custody of its
voluminous records to the National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA).[1]
There, the records remained under lock and key
for four and a half years, until last January when NARA released a fraction
of the total for public viewing. Each day, more of the released files are
scanned and posted on the Internet, making them readily accessible. Although
most of the newly-released documents are of little interest, the files I
will discuss in this article contain important new information.
As we know, the 9/11 Commission did not begin its work until 2003 - more
than a year after the fact. By this time a number of journalists had already
done independent research and published articles about various facets of
9/11. Some of this work was of excellent quality.
The Washington Post, for example, interviewed
aviation experts who stated that the plane allegedly piloted by Hani Hanjour
[AA Flight 77] had been flown,
with extraordinary skill, making it highly
likely that a trained pilot was at the helm. [2]
Yet, strangely, when other journalists
investigated Hani Hanjour they found a trail of clues indicating he was a
novice pilot, wholly incapable of executing a top
gun
maneuver and a successful suicide attack in a Boeing 757.
By early 2003 this independent research was a
matter of public record, which created a serious problem for the 9/11
Commission...
By all accounts Hani Hanjour was a diminutive fellow. He stood barely
five feet tall and was slight of build. As a young man in his hometown of
Taif, Saudi Arabia, Hanjour cultivated no great dreams of flying airplanes.
He was satisfied with a more modest ambition: he wanted to become a flight
attendant. That is, until his older brother Abulrahman encouraged him to aim
higher.
Even so, Hani Hanjours aptitude for learning
appears to have been rather limited. Although he resided in the US for about
38 months over a ten-year period that ended on 9/11, Hanjour never learned
to speak or write English, a telling observation about his capacity for
learning.
As we will discover, he actually flunked a
written test for a drivers license just weeks before 9/11.
While it is true that Hanjour trained at various flight schools in the US,
the evidence shows he was a perpetual novice. Hanjour dropped out of his
first school, the Sierra Academy of Aeronautics, located in Oakland,
after attending only a few classes. Next, he enrolled at Cockpit Resource
Management (CRM), a flight school in Scottsdale, Arizona. But his
performance as a student at CRM was less than adequate.
Duncan K.M. Hastie, owner of the school,
described Hanjour as a weak student who was wasting our resources.
[3]
After several weeks, Hanjour withdrew from the program, then returned in
1997 for another short period of instruction. This on and off pattern of
behavior was typical of the man. Hastie says that over the next three years
Hanjour called him at least twice a year, and each time wanted to return for
more training. By this time, however, it was obvious to Hastie that his
erstwhile student had no business in a cockpit.
Hastie refused to let Hanjour come back.
I would recognize his voice, Hastie said.
He was always talking about wanting more training. Yes, he wanted to be
an airline pilot. That was his stated goal. Thats why I didnt allow
him to come back. I thought Youre never going to make it. [4]
Rejected by CRM, Hanjour enrolled at nearby
Sawyer Aviation, also located in the Phoenix area. Wes Fults, a
former instructor at Sawyer, later described it as the school of last
resort.
Said Fults:
it was a commonly held truth that, if you
failed anywhere else, go to Sawyer.
Fults remembers training Hanjour, whom he
describes as a neophyte.
He says Hani got overwhelmed with the
instruments in the schools flight simulator.
He had only the barest understanding of
what the instruments were there to do, said Fults. He [Hanjour] used
the simulator three or four times, then disappeared like a fog.
[5]
I must emphasize to the reader, I am not making
this up. Other accounts by Newsday, the New York Times, as well as the FOX
network, all confirm that Hani Hanjour was at best a novice pilot.
Evading the Language
Requirement
In fact, because fluency in English is required to qualify for a US pilots
license, Hanjours atrocious English should have barred him from ever
obtaining a license. But it seems that Hanjour exploited a loophole in the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) system, which for years has
outsourced the pilot certification process.
According to a June 2002 story in the Dallas
Morning News, Hanjour was certified in April 1999 as an Airplane
Multi-Engine Land/Commercial Pilot by Daryl Strong, one of the FAAs
20,000 designated pilot examiners.[6]
Although an FAA official later defended the
agencys policy of using private contractors, a critic, Heather Awsumb,
took issue with it. Awsumb is a spokesperson for the Professional Airways
Systems Specialists (PASS) Union, which represents more than 11,000 FAA
and Defense Department employees.
She pointed out that the FAA does not have
anywhere near enough staff to oversee its 20,000 designated inspectors, all
of whom have a financial interest in certifying as many pilots as possible.
It seems that Hanjour evaded the language requirement by finding an examiner
willing to ignore the rule.
Said Awsumb:
They receive between $200 and $300 for each
flight check. If they get a reputation for being too tough, they wont
get any business. According to Awsumb, the present system allows
safety to be sold to the lowest bidder. [7]
Later, Hanjours horrible English prompted one
flight school, Jet Tech, to question the authenticity of his FAA-approved
pilots license. Jet Tech was another school in the Phoenix area where
Hanjour sought continuing instruction.
Peggy Chevrette, operation manager at Jet
Tech, later told FOX News:
I couldnt believe that he had a license of
any kind with the skills that he had. [8]
She explained that Hanjours English was so bad
it took him five hours to complete an oral exam that normally should have
taken about two.
But it wasnt just his poor English that failed to impress. In his
evaluation the Jet Tech flight instructor wrote that the,
student [Hanjour] made numerous errors
during his performance and displayed a lack of understanding of some
basic concepts. The same was true during review of systems knowledge
I
doubt his ability to pass an FAA [Boeing 737] oral at this time or in
the near future.
The 737 instructor concluded his evaluation with
a final entry:
He [Hanjour] will need much more experience
flying smaller A/C [aircraft] before he is ready to master large jets.
[9]
The 9/11 Commission Report fails to discuss or
even mention this negative written evaluation, even while presenting
Hanjours substandard performance in a Boeing 737 simulator as sufficient
evidence that Hanjour could fly a Boeing 757, an even larger plane!
[10]
The wording of the final report succeeds in
giving this impression, however dubious, even while obscuring the facts: an
amazing achievement of propaganda.
Early in 2001, Peggy Chevrette, the operation manager at Jet Tech, contacted
the FAA repeatedly to convey her concerns about Hanjour. Eventually John
Anthony, a federal inspector, showed up at the school and examined
Hanjours credentials. But Anthony found them in order and took no further
action. The inspector even suggested that Jet Tech provide Hanjour with an
interpreter.
This surprised Chevrette because it was a
violation of FAA rules.
The thing that really concerned me, she
later told FOX News, Was that John had a conversation in the hallway
with Hani and realized what his skills were at that point and his
ability to speak English. [11]
Evidently, the inspector also sat in on a class
with Hanjour.
FOX News was unable to reach John Anthony for
comment, but FAA spokesperson Laura Brown defended the FAA employee.
There was nothing about the pilots
actions she said, to signal criminal intent or that would have caused
us to alert law enforcement. [12]
This is true enough. The Jet Tech staff never
suspected that Hani Hanjour was a terrorist.
According to Marilyn Ladner,
vice-president Pan Am International, the company that owned Jet Tech,
It was more of a very typical instructional
concern that you really shouldnt be in the air. [13]
Although Pan Am dissolved its Jet Tech operation
shortly after 9/11, a former employee who knew Hanjour expressed amazement,
that he [Hanjour] could have flown into the
Pentagon. [because] He could not fly at all. [14]
The Scouting Flights
We know that in the months before the September 11, 2001 attack Hani Hanjour
rented planes at several small airports on the outskirts of New York City
and Washington DC. The 9/11 Commission Report mentions these local flights
and suggests that Hanjour was scouting the terrain: familiarizing himself
with possible suicide targets.[15]
But the record also shows the same pattern
described above. For example, on May 29, 2001 Hanjour rented a plane at a
small airport in Teterboro, New Jersey and flew the Hudson Tour,
accompanied by a flight instructor.
However, the next day, when Hanjour returned for
a repeat flight the same instructor,
would not allow it because of Hanjours
poor piloting skills. [16]
The 9/11 Commission Report actually cites
this incident, but in a context that diminishes its significance.[17]
The pattern played out again on August 16-17, 2001 when Hanjour attempted to
rent a plane at Freeway Airport, in Bowie, Maryland, about twenty miles from
Washington. Although Hanjour presented his FAA license, according to Newsday
the Freeway airport manager insisted that instructors first accompany him on
a test flight to evaluate his piloting skills.
During three such flights over two days in a
single-engine Cessna 172, instructors Sheri Baxter and Ben Conner
observed what others had before them. Hanjour had trouble controlling and
landing the aircraft. Afterward, Baxter interviewed Hanjour extensively
about his flight training and experience, and also reviewed his flight log,
which documented 600 hours of flight time.
On this basis she and Conner declined to approve
a current license rating until Hanjour returned for more training. On their
recommendation, Freeways chief instructor Marcel Bernard refused to
rent Hanjour a plane.[18] Notice, this was less than a month
before 9/11. When I reached Bernard by phone he confirmed the details of the
story by Newsday.[19]
So did Ben Conner when I spoke with him.[20]
Conner also emphasized that the issue was not simply Hanjour's poor English.
It was everything, i.e., his general ineptitude.
Curiously, The 9/11 Commission Report acknowledges Hanjours poor
English and sub-standard flying skills. The report even mentions that flight
instructors had urged Hanjour to give up trying to become a pilot.[21]
Strangely, however, another passage (in a
footnote) describes Hanjour as the [al Qaeda] operations most experienced
pilot, suggesting that the commission had a mixed opinion about Hanjour.[22]
In the end the official investigation evidently
interpreted Hanjours FAA license as sufficient proof that he had
persevered in overcoming his issues.[23] The word persevered
is straight out of the report.
But why did the commission ignore the multiple open-sourced accounts cited
above, all mutually corroborative, indicating that Hanjour would have been
lost in the cockpit of a Boeing 757 and was barely qualified to fly a
single-engine Cessna?
It is notable that The 9/11 Commission Report
fails to mention the negative written evaluation by Hanjours Jet
Tech flight instructor. The omission is serious because a glance at the
timeline shows that Hanjours 5-6 weeks of training at Jet Tech occurred in
February-March 2001, that is, after he had already earned his FAA license.
Perseverance obviously was not enough.
The instructors negative evaluation was based
on Hanjours actual skill-set at the time, license or no license. Nor does
the final report so much as mention Hanjours test flight at Freeway
airport, or the fact that he failed it. These are telling omissions.
Obviously, the commission screened out testimony that conflicted with the
official narrative of what happened on that terrible day. However, this is
not the full story.
As we are about to learn, the recently released
9/11 files have raised disturbing new questions.
The Other Flight
Instructor
It turns out that just three days after Hani Hanjour failed a flight
evaluation in a Cessna 172 at Freeway airport he showed up at Congressional
Air Charters, located down the road at Gaithersburg airport, also in the
Washington suburbs.
Once again Hanjour attempted to rent a plane,
and again he was asked to go up with an instructor for a flight evaluation
to confirm his flight skills. The plane was the same: a Cessna 172. Yet, on
this occasion Hanjour passed with flying colors and, later, this other
instructor gave testimony to the commission that turned out to be crucial.
The final report mentions the instructors name
only once in a brief endnote buried at the back of the report.
The note states:
Hanjour successfully conducted a challenging
certification flight supervised by an instructor at Congressional Air
Charter of Gaithersburg, Maryland, landing at a small airport with a
difficult approach. The instructor thought Hanjour may have had training
from a military pilot because he used a terrain recognition system for
navigation. Eddie Shalev interview. (Apr. 9, 2004) [24]
The note gives a name, Eddie Shalev, but
no other information about him. Indeed, his identity remained a mystery
until January 2009, when NARA released the 9/11 files.[25]
Nonetheless, David Ray Griffin had
already identified the key questions in his 2008 book
The New Pearl Harbor Revisited.
Wrote Griffin:
How could an instructor in Gaithersburg
[i.e., Shalev] have had such a radically different view of Hanjours
abilities from that of all of the other flight instructors who worked
with him? Who was this instructor? How could this report be verified?
[26]
These are important questions because the two
assessments of Hani Hanjours flight skills are so radically different that
both cannot be correct.
The evaluations, made just days apart, are
contradictory, hence, mutually exclusive; which raises the disturbing
possibility that someone could be lying.
The FBI File
Fortunately, another newly released document, the FBI file on Hani Hanjour,
sheds additional light on the case.[27]
The file includes a timeline and evidently was
compiled to document the governments case against Hanjour. I learned about
it from a source on the commission, a staffer who insisted to me in an email
that it authenticates Hani Hanjours flight training. At a glance it appears
to do that. However, on closer examination the file is much less impressive
and I have to wonder if the staffer actually studied it.
As we will see, the document not only falls
short of confirming Hanjours flight skills, it shows signs of having been
enhanced to obscure the record.
Crucially, the FBI file includes not a scintilla of evidence that Hani
Hanjour ever trained in a Boeing 757. Although Hanjour did some sessions a
Boeing 737 simulator, as we have already seen, the press accounts, more
importantly, his own instructors written evaluation, offer a clear and
unambiguous assessment of his actual skills.
It is also important to realize that even if
Hanjour had mastered the controls of a Boeing 737, this would not have
qualified him to execute a high-speed suicide crash in a Boeing 757, a
significantly larger and less maneuverable aircraft. Such is the view of
commercial pilots who fly these planes every day.[28]
One such pilot, Philip Marshall, who is licensed to fly Boeing 727s,
737s, 747s, as well as 757s and 767s, recently authored a book,
False Flag 911, in which he states
categorically that the alleged 9/11 hijacker pilots, including Hani Hanjour,
could never have flown 767s and 757s into buildings at high speed without
advanced training and practice flights in that same aircraft over a period
of months.
As Marshall put it:
Hitting a 90-foot target [i.e., the
Pentagon] with a 757 at 500 mph is extremely difficult - absolutely
impossible for first-time fliers of a heavy airliner. Its like
seeing Tiger Woods hit a 300-yard one-iron and someone telling you he
never practiced the shot. [29]
Marshall speculates that the hijackers may have
received advanced flight lessons from Arabic-speaking instructors at a
secret desert base somewhere in Arizona or Nevada, possibly arranged by
complicit Saudi diplomats, or by members of the Saudi royal family.[30]
This is why Hanjours inability to pass a test
flight evaluation at Freeway airport just weeks before 9/11 is so
significant: It tends to rule out Marshalls theory of advanced instruction.
Close inspection of the FBI file also shows that someone padded the record
to put the best face on Hanjours flight training. This was done in a
curious way. Instead of simply informing us that Hanjour took courses x,
y and z at such-and-such a flight school between certain dates, the FBI
file gives an itemized record of every single day that Hanjour showed up for
training at the various schools.
The effect creates the appearance of more
extensive instruction than actually occurred. Even so, the enhancement is
transparently obvious. Imagine the reaction of a potential employer if you
or I engaged in this dubious practice in a resume. On closer examination,
another reason for padding the record is also obvious.
Enhancement tends to obscure Hanjours tendency
to jump around from school to school and his inability to finish anything he
started.
The FBI file also conspicuously fails to mention the Jet Tech instructors
written evaluation of Hani Hanjours flying skills. The omission easily
qualifies as suppression of evidence because we know the FBI had the
document in its possession. It was made public at the trial of Zacharias
Moussaoui when the document was submitted as evidence. This means, of course
that the 9/11 Commission also surely had it and similarly suppressed
it. (See note #9.)
The FBI file also grossly mischaracterizes what happened at Freeway airport.
The file mentions Hanjours visits but wrongly indicates that Hanjour
received flight instruction. Not true.
When I specifically asked Marcel Bernard about
this he denied the fact and emphasized that Hanjours test flights included
no lessons and were strictly for the purpose of evaluation.[31]
The FBI should have known as much because after
9/11 Bernard and his two flight instructors notified the FBI about Hanjours
visit and were subsequently interviewed by FBI agents. The file also
conspicuously fails to mention that Hanjour flunked his test flight
evaluation! Whether through incompetence or deception, the FBI failed on
every point to state the facts correctly.
The FBI file does offer some fresh insights into Hani Hanjour the man.
On August 2, 2001, according to the timeline,
Hanjour showed up at the Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in
Arlington, where he flunked a standard written test for a Virginia drivers
license. The fact is astonishing and ought to make us wonder how Hanjour
ever managed to acquire his previous Arizona drivers license issued in 1991
and his Florida license issued in 1996, let alone master the controls of a
Boeing 757.
There is another interesting item. The record indicates that on September 5,
2001, just six days before 9/11, Hanjour showed up at the First Union
National Bank in Laurel, Maryland where he made four failed bank
transactions. The file cites bank records showing that Hanjour was unable to
make balance inquiries and withdraw funds from his account because he failed
to enter the correct pin number, which he evidently had forgotten!
Two days later, Hanjour returned to the bank,
this time accompanied by an unidentified male, and made another unsuccessful
attempt to withdraw $4900.
It is astonishing the FBI file was ever touted as authenticating
Hanjours flight credentials. The document falls short on that score and
actually raises new questions.
How likely is it that a man who was unable to
remember his own pin number, and who just weeks before 9/11 flunked a simple
test for a drivers license, could have executed a top gun maneuver in a
commercial airliner? The odds, I would submit, are approximately zero.
The FBI file includes one other curious entry. On August 20, 2001 Hanjour
shopped at Travelocity.com for information about September 5, 2001
flights from Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles.
This suggests that as of August 20 Hanjour did
not yet know the date of the planned attack, either because he had not been
briefed or because the date had not yet been selected. By the end of the
month, however, the die was cast. On August 31 Hanjour and another
middle-eastern male purchased one-way tickets for AA Flight 77 from a New
Jersey travel agent. The date of departure: September 11, 2001.
Yet, given Hanjours level of skill, one has to
wonder what the waif from Taif believed was supposed to happen on that
fateful morning.
So, Who is Eddie
Shalev?
The record compiled by the FBI for the purpose of to authenticating Hani
Hanjours flight skills fails to provide convincing substantiation. Notice,
for this reason it also fails to support the testimony of the other flight
instructor, Eddie Shalev, who certified Hanjour to rent a Cessna 172
from Congressional Air Charters just three days after Marcel Bernard,
the chief instructor at Freeway, refused to rent Hanjour the very same
plane.
The 9/11 Commission Report makes no
mention of the incident at Freeway airport, nor does it discuss Eddie Shalev,
other than alluding to Hanjours certification flight in a brief endnote.
This is curious, since it now appears that Shalevs testimony was crucial.
By telling the commission what it was predisposed to hear, Shalev gave the
official investigation an excuse to ignore the preponderance of evidence,
which pointed to the unthinkable.
So, who is Eddie Shalev?
His identity remained unknown for more than
seven years, but was finally revealed in one of the files released in
January 2009 by the National Archives. The document, labeled a Memorandum
for the Record, is a summary of the April 2004 interview with Eddie Shalev
conducted by commission staffer Quinn John Tamm.[32]
The document confirms that Shalev went on
record:
Mr Shalev stated that based on his
observations Hanjour was a good pilot.
It is noteworthy that Tamm also spoke with
Freeway instructors Sheri Baxter and Ben Conner, as revealed
by yet another recently-released document.[33]
Although I was unable to reach Tamm or Baxter
for comment, I did talk with Conner, who confirmed the conversation.[34]
Conner says he fully expected to testify before the commission. Perhaps not
surprisingly, the call never came.
But the shocker is the revelation that Eddie Shalev is an Israeli and
served in the Israeli army.
The file states that,
Mr. Shalev served in the Israeli Defense
Forces in a paratroop regiment. He was a jumpmaster on a Boeing C-130.
Mr. Shalev moved to the Gaithersburg area in April 2001 and was
sponsored for employment by Congressional Air Charters...[which] has
subsequently gone out of business.
The memorandum raises disturbing questions.
Consider the staffers strange choice of words
in describing Shalevs employment.
It is curious that the charter service
subsequently went out of business.
But the most important question is:
-
Just how thoroughly, if at all, did the
commission vet Eddie Shalev?
-
Does his military record include service
in the Israeli intelligence community?
Real people have known addresses. But the
current whereabouts of Eddie Shalev is unknown.
As reported by David Griffin, a 2007 search of
the national telephone directory, plus Google searches by research librarian
Elizabeth Woodworth, turned up no trace of him. A LexisNexis
search by Matthew Everett also came up dry.[35]
Recent searches by Woodworth and myself indicate
that an "Eddy Shalev" resided in Rockville, Maryland as recently as 2007.
However, the associated phone number is no longer in service. The 9/11
memorandum raises the possibility that Shalev may have returned to Israel.
Clearly, the man needs to be found, subpoenaed and made to testify under
oath before a new investigation, even if this necessitates extradition.
Quinn John Tamm and the two Freeway instructors,
Sheri Baxter and Ben Conner, should also be subpoenaed. All are key
witnesses and obvious starting points for a new 9/11 investigation.
Given his identity, the search for and possible extradition of Eddie
Shalev could become controversial.
But 9/11 investigators must not be turned aside.
We must follow the trail of evidence, regardless. Should it lead into a dark
wood, we must resolve to go there; and if it takes us to the gates of hell,
so be it. When our search obtains a certain critical mass, momentum will
shift decisively in our favor.
Public support for a new 9/11 investigation will
become irresistible.
The light of truth will do the rest...
