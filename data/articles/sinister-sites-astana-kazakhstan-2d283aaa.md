Astana is the first capital being built in the
21st century and it perfectly represents where the world is headed.
It is truly one mans vision: Nursultan
Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan (yes Borats country, I know).
Backed by billions of petrodollars, the city is being built from scratch in
a remote and deserted area of the Asian steppes.
The result is astonishing:
a futuristic occult capital, embracing the
New
World Order while celebrating the most ancient religion known to
man:
Sun Worship.
The city is still a huge construction site, but
the buildings that are already completed already sum up Nazarbayevs occult
vision.
The Pyramid of Peace
Conceived by Britains most prolific architect,
Lord
Norman Foster, this giant pyramid is an odd presence in the middle of
the Asian Steppes.
The building is dedicated to the renunciation of
violence and to bring together the worlds religions.
Norman Foster has said that the building has no
recognizable religious symbols to permit the harmonious reunification of
confessions. In reality, the pyramid is a temple for the occultists only
TRUE religion:
Sun worship.
A journey inside this building is a truly
symbolic one. It represents each humans path to illumination.
Lets take the tour.
The Pyramidal Shape
The initiates accepted the pyramid form
as the ideal symbol of both the secret doctrine and those
institutions established for its dissemination
-Manly P. Hall
Secret
Teachings of All Ages
Novus Ordo
Seclorum = New Order for the Ages
As Manly P. Hall stated, the pyramid is the
ultimate symbol representing the mysteries of ancient civilizations.
Sublime in their simplicity, divine in their
proportions, they embody both the divine knowledge owned by the
illuminated and the bewilderment of the masses. Todays elite, initiated
to the occult, are the heirs of this ancient wisdom and use the pyramid
as a symbol of power in the modern world.
The illuminated/floating/missing capstone
represents the divine principle present in the universe as well in each
human being. Another symbolic meaning attributed to the missing capstone
is the unfinished nature of the New World Order. It is said that the
capstone of the Great Pyramid will be reinstated when this age old
project will become reality.
Here are
other pyramids appearing across the
world, representing the elites power over the masses.
Memphis Arena
Luxor Hotel, Las
Vegas
Raffles Hotel,
Dubai
The Opera House (Basement)
When entering the pyramid at ground level, the interior is dark and
cavernous. The basement houses Astanas opera house, where the
unsuspecting mass gets entertained.
Underground Opera
House
Despite the darkness, a huge image of the
sun occupies almost all of the ceiling.
The Midsection
Around the Sun
Table
Right on top of the opera house is the
central space of the pyramid.
It acts as the meeting room for
conferences reuniting religious leaders of the world. Take a minute and
soak up the symbolism here. You have religious leaders from around the
world sitting around a huge figure of the sun, discussing how to
reconcile their differences for the coming New Age.
The symbolism is blatant: all these
theologies are simply outgrowth of the original object of worship: the
Sun.
This space is much more luminous than the opera house, representing the
progress towards illumination. The sun image in the middle of the round
table is exactly on top of the sun of the opera house.
So while the general population is being
entertained in the darkness of the material world, the illuminated,
sitting right on top of them, are contemplating how to reach godliness.
Contemplating
Godliness
If you read other articles on this site, you
might be aware of the objectives of the New World Order. One of them is
the replacement of all religions by a form of neo-paganism. This is what
those meetings are for.
The city of Astana is truly
a city of the
New World Order.
The Apex
The apex is literally heavenly.
It is round, totally windowed and bathing in
glorious sunlight. Images of white doves are embedded in the windows,
representing peace, which will result in the unification of the world
governments and religions in the New World Order.
The apex is the
ultimate representation of the achievement of illumination, on an
individual and on the worldly level.
Look at the ceiling of the apex:
The solar deity is shining upon the
illuminated. Beautiful.
The pyramids divisions (the lower dark opera house, the middle
conference room and the godly apex) embody the Pythagorean vision of the
world.
Pythagoras teachings are thoroughly studied
in todays occult societies.
Pythagoras divided the universe into
three parts, which he called the Supreme World, the Superior World,
and the Inferior World.
The highest, or Supreme World, was a subtle,
interpenetrative spiritual essence pervading all things and
therefore the true plane of the Supreme Deity itself, the Deity
being in every sense omnipresent, omniactive, omnipotent, and
omniscient. Both of the lower worlds existed within the nature of
this supreme sphere.
The Superior World was the home of the immortals. It was also the
dwelling place of the archetypes, or the seals; their natures in no
manner partook of the material of earthiness, but they, casting
their shadows upon the deep (the Inferior World), were cognizable
only through their shadow.
The third, or Inferior World, was the
home of those creatures who partook of material substance or were
engaged in labor with or upon material substance.
Hence, this sphere
was the home of (
) mankind and the lower kingdoms, those
temporarily of the earth but capable of rising above that sphere by
reason and philosophy.
The three sections
of the Pyramid
In other words, this pyramid, much more than
being a tourist attraction, is a representation of the philosophy of the
initiates.
As
Dan Cruickshank rather cryptically
said in his documentary, it is a representation of the power to come.
Bayterek
Also designed by the distinguished British
architect Sir Norman Foster, the monument is meant to embody a folktale
about a mythical tree of life and a magic bird of happiness.
The bird, named
Samruk, had laid its egg in the crevice between two branches of a
poplar tree. The egg the golden globe at the top of the monument
represents, once again, the Sun, the Supreme Deity.
This tree of life, represents the channel through which spirits go to
leave the material world and join the divine world.
This concept is a recurrent in most (if not all)
esoteric societies.
Inside the Golden Globe
The Total Recall Thing
Visitors can go at the top of the tower and get a wonderful view
of Nazarbayevs city. There are also some strange items to look at.
Inside the globe we find this enigmatic
thing. Its a golden triangle with president Nazarbayevs
handprint in it. Why? I honestly dont know.
All I can say is that
it looks like something out of the movie Total Recall.
Bata Composition
It is a globe signed by representatives
from seventeen religious denominations.
Yes, once again, talking
about uniting all religions into one for the NWO and all of that.
Masonic Pillars
Two pillars and one in between, further
away.
Is there a chance that this may be Masonic symbolism?
Yes, the twin golden pillars represent the
two pillars of Masonry named Boaz and Jachin.
I wont go into the whole
symbolism behind those pillars, but we can probably assume that Nazarbayev is a Free and Accepted Mason.
Presidential Palace
Placed in a commanding position in the city,
the Presidential Palace sits at the end of a ceremonial route which
starts with the Bayterek tower. A big fat dome sits on top of the
palace, representing the female principle, in opposition to the
phallic Bayterek tower the male principle.
This layout is present in almost all
important cities, including Washington DC and Paris.
Khan Shatyry Entertainment Center (The Worlds
Biggest Tent)
This unfinished oddity is designed, once
again, by Sir Norman Foster (he basically designed the whole city).
Underneath the tent, an area larger than 10 football stadiums, will be
an urban-scale internal park, shopping and entertainment venue with
squares and cobbled streets, a boating river, shopping centre, minigolf
and indoor beach resort.
It has been said that this structure is made
to look like a tabernacle, on par with the Temple of Solomon.
These portable places of worship, composed
of tents, were used by Jews during biblical times. Initiates attribute
to these ancient settlements an esoteric meaning.
Coming Soon in Astana
Astana is still under heavy construction, but there are some truly
amazing projects in the works.
Here are some of them.
Central Markets
Designed by our good friend Norman
Foster.
Crazy Towers (not the official name)
All-Seeing Eye Stadium (not the
official name)
To Conclude
As members of the world elite are fulfilling the conditions required to
unite the world into a single government, they are scattering all over the
world symbols of their power.
The fact that the general population have no
idea what those structures represent is exactly the reason why their plans
go forward unquestioned and unnoticed. But those plans have been here for
ages now.
Manley P. Hall wrote in 1918:
When the mob governs, man is ruled by
ignorance; when the church governs, he is ruled by superstition; and
when the state governs, he is ruled by fear.
Before men can live
together in harmony and understanding, ignorance must be transmuted into
wisdom, superstition into an illuminated faith, and fear into love
Mob is equal to democracy, church is equal to
religion and state is equal to countries. In other words, before men can
live in harmony, we have to abolish democracy (because the mass is too
dumb), religions (because they are superstitions) and states (because we
need one world government).
He continues:
The perfect government of the earth must be
patterned eventually after that divine government by which the universe
is ordered.
In that day when perfect order is reestablished, with peace
universal and good triumphant, men will no longer seek for happiness,
for they shall find it welling up within themselves
Sound good doesnt it? Only one catch. When this
will happen, most of the world population will be dead.
On that note, have a
nice day.
