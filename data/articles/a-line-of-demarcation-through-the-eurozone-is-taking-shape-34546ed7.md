Everyone learned a lesson from the bail-in of
the Cypriot banks:
-
Russian account holders whod laundered
and stored their money on the sunny island
-
bank bondholders whod thought theyd
always get bailed out
-
Cypriot politicians whose names showed
up on lists of loans that had been extended by the Bank of Cyprus
and Laiki Bank but were then forgiven and written off
Even brand-new Finance Minister Michael Sarris
who got axed because hed been
chairman of Laiki when this was going on.
His lesson:
when a cesspool of
corruption blows up, no one is safe.
And German politicians learned a lesson too:
that it worked!
With the Cyprus aid package, it was proven
that countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland, if they stick
together, are able to push for a strict stability course, Hans
Michelbach told the
Handelsblatt.
The chairman of the finance committee in the
German Parliament and member of the CSU, Chancellor Angela Merkels
coalition partner, called for deeper collaboration of the "triple-A countries"
in the Eurozone,
to strengthen the confidence of citizens
and investors in the common currency.
There are still five in that Euro triple-A club:
-
Germany
-
Austria
-
the Netherlands
-
Finland
-
Luxembourg.
It would be good if we could also convince
Luxembourg to participate more strongly in this stability
collaboration, he said.
It would be in the best interest of Luxembourg
as major financial center, he added. A reference to Luxembourgs precarious
status, as Cyprus had learned, of being a tiny country with outsized banks
that it could not bail out by itself.
To protect the Euro, the alliance of the
triple-A countries must be united firmly against large Euro countries like
Italy and France, he said.
Strong signals of stability would be of great
importance for the Eurozone, particularly now, given the unclear
situation in Italy,
...renewed doubts about Greece, and the failure of the
French government in its stability policies.
Exactly what French President François Hollande
needs: the Euro triple-A club breathing down his neck. He's already in
trouble at home. To reverse the slide, he got on state-owned France 2 TV
last Thursday to speak to the French people so that they could see how his
sincerity, wisdom, and economic policies would stop the country from sinking
ever deeper into a quagmire.
And a quagmire it is:
He has tweaked some policy measures here and
there.
And he dug up a new version of the 75%
income-tax bracket that had been squashed by the Constitutional Court. But
Jérôme Cahuzac, the Budget Minister whod tried to get the first version
through the system,
went up in flames over allegations of tax fraud and tax fraud
laundering.
Now the people have had it. After the TV
appearance, his approval rating, ten months into his term,
plummeted another 6 points to 31%, a low that scandal-plagued Nicolas
Sarkozy took four years to reach.
And only 27% approved of his economic policies.
The French simply dont want austerity,
lamented an unnamed government insider.
France was suffering the consequences of the
socialist experiments of its government and was becoming less and less
competitive, explained Hans Michelbach.
He emphasized that France would remain an
important partner of Germany. He wasnt kidding: France buys 10% of
Germanys exports and is crucial to the German economy.
But if France didnt change course, he said,
that could become a serious problem for the Eurozone. As opposed to the mere hiccups of Cyprus or
Greece.
More banks and more countries will require bailouts:
-
Slovenia
-
Spain
-
Italy
-
Malta,
...are on the list.
And no one wants to see France on
that list. Even Italy is too large to get bailed out by other countries -
though its rich enough to bail itself out, à la Cyprus [A
Politically Explosive Secret - Italians Are Over Twice As Wealthy
As Germans].
But in Germany, a revolt against these save-the-Euro
bailouts has been brewing for a while.
With elections in September, its
taking on volume and voices, and the structure of a political party, the
Alternative for Germany, not unpalatable radicals but the educated
bourgeoisie, and they want to
stop the bailouts and dump the Euro.
The government is feeling the heat. No one can
afford to lose votes. Michelbachs triple-A club, a line of demarcation in
the Eurozone, is one of the reactions. Merkel might benefit from it in the
elections. The other four countries might find if appealing, though it will
be of dubious appeal in the rest of the Eurozone.
But if efforts fail to fix the Eurozones
problems - and the Eurozone lumbering that way - a tightly knit triple-A
club could weather the storm together, more stable and more unified than the
Eurozone ever was. And Michelbach had just floated a version of that idea.
Decades of economic mismanagement, political
ineptitude, corruption, and financial fraud in Latin America -
overseen by
the IMF, now a protagonist in Europes Troika (European Union,
European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund) - reached their nadir in
the
Mexican Tequila Crisis.
It should have served as a portent of the
financial storms now buffeting Europe...
