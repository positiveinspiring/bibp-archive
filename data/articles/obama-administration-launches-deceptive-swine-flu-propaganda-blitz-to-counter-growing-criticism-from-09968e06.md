President
Obama and his top health officials are
engaging in a major public relations effort to divert attention away from
whether its swine flu vaccine is effective and safe to whether there is
enough of it to go around. And the media, as always, is cooperating fully.
This echoes the way media debate was manipulated
during the Vietnam and Iraq Wars. Instead of debating whether we should even
be fighting those wars, the media debated only whether we were using the
correct military strategy.
Increasing numbers of scientists and doctors are issuing harsh criticisms of
the Governments plan to vaccinate (forcibly if necessary) virtually the
entire U.S. population with what they claim is a poorly tested vaccine that
is not only ineffective against swine flu, but could cripple and even kill
many more people than it helps.
The CDCs public relations campaign has been running scare ads that
portray
swine flu as a full-blown pandemic
responsible for snuffing out countless lives, and which, unless stopped by
universal vaccination, could kill millions of American citizens. But
scientists and health officials throughout the world have called the
governments claims unjustified and deliberately misleading.
For example, Dr. Anthony Morris, a distinguished virologist and
former Chief Vaccine Office at the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA),
states that,
There is no evidence that any influenza
vaccine thus far developed is effective in preventing or mitigating any
attack of influenza and that The producers of these vaccines know they
are worthless, but they go on selling them anyway.
And in November 2007, the UK newspaper The
Scotsman, made public warnings by the inventor of the flu jab, Dr.
Graeme Laver.
Dr. Laver was a major Australian scientist
involved in the invention of a flu vaccine, in addition to playing a leading
scientific role in the discovery of anti-flu drugs.
He went on record as saying
the vaccine he helped to create was ineffective and [that]
natural infection with the flu was safer.
I have never been impressed with its
efficacy, said Dr. Laver.
We hear the assumption being made by the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
that the number of deaths from the H1N1 virus is at pandemic levels and now
a national emergency.
One would assume that with all of its resources,
the New York Times October 26 front page story on the CDCs
statistics would be accurate: 20,000 hospitalizations and 1,000 deaths due
to the swine flu. However, this is all fiction. And it is a fiction
solely based upon the CDCs own contradictory statements and actions.
Our independent investigations into the clinical trials and statistical
studies of influenza vaccines reveal glaring discrepancies. Let us not
forget that it is this same New York Times, with its star reporter
Judith Miller, who led America into believing that Saddam Hussein
possessed weapons of mass destruction, tried to purchase yellow cake
uranium from Niger, and had dealings with al-Qaeda.
And let us also remember that it is the same CDC
and health officials in Washington, including President Ford and his top
health advisor F. David Matthews, who pushed through and
propagandized an untested vaccine during the 1976 swine flu scare, which
resulted in thousands of severely neurologically damaged Americans and about
500 reported deaths.
Aside from permanent paralysis, many of
these vaccine victims also underwent torturous processes for many years to
get the government to recognize their illnesses and help cover their costs.
Not only was the CDCs prediction and
vaccination campaign for the 1976 flu season a total disaster, it also
turned into a deadly scandal, witnessed across the United States on
60 Minutes when Dr. David Sencer, then head of the CDC, confirmed
that the vaccine was never field tested, that there were only several
reported incidents of H1N1 infection and none of these had been officially
confirmed, and then lied about the CDC having no prior evidence that the
swine flu vaccine could cause severe and permanent neurological damage.
The end result from the 1976 debacle cost the
government $3.5 billion in damages, two-thirds were for severe neurological
injury and death directly due to the CDCs vaccination campaign.
Therefore, being anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine is not the most
urgent issue. What is critical is whether or not there is legitimate, sound
science to support either position; in this regard, the vaccine
manufacturers and our federal health agencies have failed in the past, and
continue to fail today. And they fail dismally.
There is absolutely no evidence for
sound-scientific protocol or anything resembling a gold-standard behind the
swine flu infection statistics and vaccine efficacy and safety clinical
trials to support Obamas and his health advisors claims. Instead, the
reports on hospitalizations and deaths due to the H1N1 virus are grossly
distorted.
What we are really witnessing is official
science and statistics that are little more than propaganda.
One unfortunate development over the years is the notion that there is such
a thing as a flu season.
The truth is that we move annually into periods
where there are dramatic increases in flu-like causing pathogens, however,
the majority of these are unrelated to any strain of influenza virus. There
can between 150 and 200 different infectious pathogens - adenovirus,
rhinovirus, parainfluenza, the very common coronavirus and, of course,
pneumonia - that produce flu-like symptoms, and worse, during a flu
season.
For example, how many people have heard of
bocavirus, which is responsible for bronchitis and pneumonia in young
children, or metapneumovirus, responsible for more than 5 percent of all
flu-related illnesses? This is true during every flu season and this year is
no different. Furthermore, all flu vaccinations, including the swine flu,
are useless for protecting people from these many prevalent infectious
organisms.
If we take the combined figure of flu and pneumonia deaths for the period of
2001, and add a bit of spin to the figures, we are left believing that
62,034 people died from influenza. The actual figures determined by Peter
Doshi, then at Harvard University, are 61,777 died from pneumonia and
only 257 from flu. Even more amazing, among those 257 cases only 18 were
confirmed positive for influenza.
A separate study conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics for the flu periods between 1979 through
2002 revealed the true range of flu deaths were between 257 and 3006, for an
average of 1,348 per year.
The recent CBS Investigative Report, published on October 21, is one
example. After the CDC refused to honor CBSs Freedom of Information
request to receive flu infection data for each individual state, the
network performed independent outreach to all fifty states to get their
statistics. Their report contradicts dramatically the CDCs public relations
blitz.
For example,
-
In California, among the approximate
13,000 flu-like cases, 86 percent tested negative for any flu
strain.
-
In Florida, out of 8,853 cases, 83
percent were negative.
-
In Georgia and Alaska, only 2.4 percent
and 1 percent respectively tested positive for flu virus among all
reported flu-like cases.
If the infectious-rate ratios obtained by CBS
are accurate, the CDCs figures are significantly reduced and agree with
earlier predictions that the H1N1 virus will be simply an unwelcomed
annoyance.
So we are in the midst of an enormous medical
hoax, a design and purpose that has yet to unfold completely, that will
nevertheless reap huge revenues for the vaccine industrial complex.
Another example is a recent alarmist report issuing from Georgetown
University, also usurped by federal health officials and their multimedia
comrades to fuel a campaign of fear and panic. The report announced that
over 250 students were infected by swine flu when in fact none of these
students were tested for H1N1 infection.
The universitys figure was based solely on a
count of student visits to the health clinic and calls into an H1N1 hotline.
This is not the first time the CDCs predictions for influenza strains have
been overstated and miscalculated. In an interview on Swedish television,
Dr. Tom Jefferson, head of
vaccine studies at the prestigious international Cochrane
Database Collaboration, after reviewing hundreds of influenza studies
and statistical analyses, has said the WHOs and CDCs performance is
not very good.
And in an ITN News interview last month,
Jefferson called the swine flu pandemic a,
juggernaut they [the
WHO, government agencies and vaccine makers] created.
For the 1992-1993 season, the prediction was off
by 84 percent. For the 1994-1995 season, it was off 43 percent for the
primary strain and off 87 percent and 76 percent for two other strains.
The Laboratory Center for Disease Controls
study comparing vaccine strains with the strains appearing during the
1997-1998 season found the match was off by 84 percent.
Again Dr. Jefferson in a Der Spiegel
interview remarked,
there are some people who make predictions
year after year, and they get worse and worse. None of them so far have
come about, and these people are still there making these predictions.
For example, what happened with the bird
flu, which was supposed to kill us all?... Swine flu could have even
stayed unnoticed if it had been caused by some unknown virus rather than
an influenza virus...
An influenza vaccine is not working for the
majority of influenza-like illnesses because it is only designed to
combat influenza viruses. For that reason, the vaccine changes nothing
when it comes to the heightened mortality rate during the winter
months.
Our review of all clinical trial studies
conducted by the H1N1 vaccine makers for pre-licensing in the American
market - CSL, Novartis, Sanofi-Pasteur, Medimmune and now GlaxoSmithKline -
reveals they were poorly designed and feebly executed.
Any professor in molecular biology or virology
would fail a graduate student who presented a paper relying on research
conducted in the manner of the studies the vaccine corporations submit to
the FDA. Nevertheless, it is this lack of sound randomized, double-blind
controlled placebo studies, particularly for inactivated virus vaccines,
that our government is declaring definitive and is using to justify mass
vaccination of our population.
Last week, Switzerlands health authorities rejected Novartis new swine flu
vaccine, Celtura, being targeted for women and children, because the
companys studies were insufficient to guarantee its safety. In addition,
the new Novartis vaccine, which uses a cell base from dogs, was found to be
contaminated with canine-specific bacteria.
The Swiss newspaper, Tagesanzeiger, also
noted there remains some suspicion that Novartis new vaccine may be a
repackaging of an earlier 2008 vaccine responsible for killing almost two
dozen homeless people during an illegal clinical trial in Poland. This is
the same Novartis whose Fluvirin H1N1 vaccine being distributed in
the US relied only on a hasty clinical efficacy and safety trial enrolling
only a small number of health adults.
Novartis likely remains unperturbed. The Swiss
pharmaceutical giant has reported a $6.1 billion profit so far this year and
expects to boost sales for the final quarter with its swine flu vaccine.
In July, the CDC announced it would cease testing and counting H1N1 virus
infections. Their public reason was simply that they are convinced there is
a pandemic and, therefore, accurate monitoring was unnecessary.
On August 30, the CDC declared the states should
report influenza and pneumonia-associated hospitalizations and deaths
together, not singling out actual cases of H1N1 infection if there happen to
be any actually confirmed from a laboratory. This has always been the CDCs
policy, and the 36,000 figure of annual flu deaths repeated ad nausea on
their website and spewed from the medias health pulpits for several years
straight, does not distinguish between pneumonia, influenza and other
flu-like pathogenic deaths.
Perhaps it would make very little difference
because the current rapid diagnostic tests for the H1N1 virus can range in
only 10-50 percent accuracy.
Elsewhere in the world, particularly in Europe, civilians are increasingly
rejecting the H1N1 vaccine. Recent polls in Germany and Austria show only 13
and 18 percent respectively willing to take the shot. In Sweden, four
vaccine related deaths have been announced and almost 200 healthcare workers
have reported becoming more seriously ill from the vaccination than they
might have from a flu infection.
In the US, anywhere from 90-99 percent of
adverse events go unreported.
If people would simply shut off the CDCs supported propaganda noise being
blasted across the airwaves and newspapers - the spectacle of newscasters
being inoculated, interviews with government health officials or private
doctors and academics receiving consultation fees from drug makers, and the
drivel of the New York Times - and simply do their homework,
Americans would wake up and realize the hoax behind the swine flu pandemic.
All of the information is before us. Nothing is
hidden. All the contradictions and hypocrisies are contained within the
massive vaccine industrial complex - including the government health
agencies and professional medical associations.
The lie is too large for them to not expose
themselves if we simply look.
