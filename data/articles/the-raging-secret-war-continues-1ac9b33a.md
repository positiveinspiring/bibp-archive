People trying to find out what is really
happening with the ongoing financial war appear to be confused these days.
That is because even at the very top of the world pecking order there is
confusion.
What my direct sources - as opposed to internet
sources like Casper, Heneghan, Poof, Story, Rense, etc. - (my NSA sources
tell me they are all reliable but do get fed disinformation from time to
time) tell me is that a new financial system has been set up but
that the owners of the Federal Reserve Board do not want to give up their
dollar printing press.
The result is a stalemate that could drag on for
a while yet. As time goes on, the
owners of the Fed are losing their power base as their global
network is dismantled bit by bit. However, these people ARE NEVER TO BE
UNDERESTIMATED and could do something really crazy.
The identities of the people at the top fighting the Feds worldwide need to
keep their names secret for protection.
There are several groups who have huge physical holdings of gold and
treasure who are united in opposing fiat based monetary systems because the
owners of the fiat system have tried to keep these physical holdings out of
the monetary system.
If these treasures were recognized by the
global banking system it would mean a loss of power for the
Rothschilds,
Papa Bush,
Rockefeller and the other owners of dollar
and Euro printing presses.
In other words, the Feds are being fought by
Royal families and industrialists who have real treasure or make
real things.
The latest I have on the situation in China is this: The Emperor's name is
Chi Yuen Chin. He is a university professor. Remember, he is a Manchu
not a Ming emperor. It could be there are also Ming royal family members
with hidden treasure but I just do not know. He has truly fabulous amounts
of treasure. To give you an idea of how fabulous, think about the national
museum in Taiwan. There is a mountain behind the museum filled with treasure
(ceramics, gold, government bonds etc.).
Every year for the past 60 years they have
changed the treasures displayed at the museum.
Despite this, they have not come even close to
displaying everything that is hidden in the mountain. And this treasure is
just one of several secret treasures hidden inside mountains. There are at
least two of similar size that I know about on mainland China. I do not know
what the Emperor Chin owns but it is apparently fabulous too. I also do not
know what his views are.
The treasures I know about can only be used to serve the greater good as
determined by a very secret but benevolent society. This society
supports the creation of a new monetary system that is more fair to
the people and living creatures of the planet.
There are other fabulous treasures in other parts of the world too, such as
the Thai Royal Family Treasure and the British Royal Family Treasure.
Leaders of most of the countries of the world are also now united against
the Feds. The Feds still control about half the Pentagon, a giant private
army of mercenaries and spies, President
Obama
and his hypnotized human sheep, most senior politicians and the supreme
court. Inside the US they are opposed by half of the pentagon, half or more
of the people in US government agencies, state leaders and much of the
intelligentsia.
The bottom line though, is that the Federal Reserve Board is bankrupt
and all its owners can do is play for time and threaten to spread diseases
and start war.
