We may be on the verge of a stock market crash reminiscent of 1929.
I was watching a special CNBC program on the financial crisis when the news
came across that Moody's had downgraded the Insurance giant AIG (American
International Group.) This company was already on the ropes Monday when its
stock crumbled to $4.75 from $11, %60 in one day. It was down from a $70
52-week-high. The company had gone to the Fed for a bailout. It was
estimated it needed $40 billion.
Because of the Moody's downgrade, it emerges that it will need a lot more
money to avert bankruptcy. This is a massive company that holds the pensions
of millions of employees. A money manager estimated that a trillion dollars
would be lost if AIG declares bankruptcy. The whole world financial system
could be taken down. He said banks in the Far East were already acting like
this is inevitable, and the collapse already has been set in motion.
As you can imagine, the CNBC commentators were frantic. One demanded to know
how the Fed can allow this to happen.
"We know they print money," he said.
Another wondered if the States whose pension funds were held by AIG could
organize a bailout. Not enough time, he was told.
The bottom line is that Tuesday and the rest of this week could be ugly so
be prepared. The second bottom line is that this Depression like the last
appears to be caused by a deliberate contraction of credit. House prices are
falling because banks don't have the money to lend to house buyers. As a
result, portfolios holding mortgage backed securities are tumbling, taking
banks with them.
The Fed, after bailing out Fannie May and
Fredie Mack, have
let Lehman Brothers fail. AIG appears to be next and the dominoes will
continue to fall.
At this time, it is important to remember that an Illuminati defector known
as "Svali" said she was taught that
the "end of the world" scenario involved
an economic collapse. Remember the Illuminati is a Masonic cult founded and
funded by the central bankers who own
the Fed.
Here is her full testimony
given about ten year ago.
"Want to hear the end of the world scenario the Illuminati taught me?
It was
cult propaganda, but this is how they believed the New Order would be
ushered in:
There will be
continued conflict in the Mideast, with a severe threat of
nuclear war being the culmination of these hostilities. An economic collapse
that will devastate the economy of the US and Europe, much like the great
depression.
One reason that our economy continues limping along is the artificial
supports that the Federal Reserve had given it, manipulating interest rates,
etc. But one day, this won't work (or this leverage will be withdrawn on
purpose) and the next great depression will hit.
The government will call in its bonds and loans, and credit card debts will
be called in. There will be massive bankruptcies nationwide. Europe will
stabilize first, and Germany, France and England (surprise) will have the
strongest economies, and will institute through the UN an international
currency. Japan will also pull out, although their economy will be weakened.
Peacekeeping forces will be sent out by
the UN and local bases to prevent
riots. The leaders will reveal themselves, and people will be asked to make
a pledge of loyalty during a time of chaos and financial devastation.
Doesn't sound pleasant, does it?
I don't know the exact time frame for all
of this, and wouldn't want to even guess. The good news is that if a person
is debt-free, owes nothing to the government or credit debt, and can live
self sufficiently, they may do better than others. I would invest in gold,
not stocks, if I had the income.
Gold will once again be the world standard, and dollars will be pretty
useless (remember after the Civil War? Our money will be worth about what
confederate money was after the collapse).
All this said, it could just be cult propaganda taught to me and others to
frighten us. It may be that none of this will happen. I sincerely hope not.
I also strongly believe that God is able to stay the hand of the wicked, and
to take care of our nation and others, if we turn to Him."
That noted, let's remember the words of Denis Healey, former
British Defense
Secretary and Secretary of the Exchequer:
"World events do not occur by
accident: They are made to happen, whether it is to do with national issues
or commerce; and most of them are staged and managed by those who hold the
purse strings."
I think we are in for a recession, maybe even a
Depression but I don't think
the Illuminati is ready to declare their
New World Order just yet. However,
this could be part of a larger scenario leading to World War Three, similar
to the role the Great Depression played as a precursor to World War Two.
The Illuminati goal is to torture the human race until we cry out to them
for world government, anything to stop the pain...
