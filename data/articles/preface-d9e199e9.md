This book expands on Secrets of the Federal Reserve, by the same author, and details the history of the interlocking financial and business elites in Britain, Europe and the United States. It also includes some interesting history of the major tax exempt foundations. Unfortunately, this edition does not include footnotes.
For easier online reading, section indexes have been added, long paragraphs have been divided, and name lists have been formatted for HTML.
In July, 2003, author Eustace Mullins was interviewed by James Dyer:
Dyer: I found an entire copy of "Secrets of the Federal Reserve" on the internet. Do you mind that your books may be on the net?
Mullins: There's nothing I can do about it. I'd like to have the money, but it's more important that the information gets out there. That's the key to the whole thing. If people know what's going on, then there's a chance that something could be done about it.
