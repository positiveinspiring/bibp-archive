TRUE DEMOCRACY SUMMER 2001 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
To understand what the CIA really is, read the book entitled Inside The
Company by Philip Agee, a former CIA operative who describes the real
CIA, not just the intelligence gathering capability of the agency. Then read
the first edition of True Democracy (La verdad sobre la democracia)
to see that President Kennedy wanted to disband this agency. This is one
of the two agencies that he wanted to disband.
It is understood that gathering intelligence is not the only duty of the
agency. The intelligence which is gathered then needs to be used by the government
to its advantage to maintain the status quo. In fact, scholars state
unequivocally
that the CIA is a tool of the elite to maintain the status quo not to help
the mass of people who inhabit the earth.
Formed in 1947 as the successor to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS),
the CIA operates in every single country on earth. The agency meddles in
foreign government's affairs for the benefit of the elite. The first election
the agency controlled was the Italian election in 1947. Then, the agency overthrew
the Mossedegh government in Iran in 1953 replacing it in the easiest coup
it would ever undertake. It would later overthrow the government of the Shah
as well because he wanted to do three acts that would have altered the status
quo. Then, in 1954 the agency overthrew the Arbenz government in Guatemala
because of its Communistic leanings.
The Vietnam War was not fought to prevent the Vietnamese people from turning
to Communism. The Vietnamese people wanted independence in addition to the
country being rich in rubber and oil such that the hegemony of the United
States didn't want to forego the cheap resources and allow the country to
have independence because if they had, all the other nations in the region
would have followed suit so a war was begun with a lie to the American people
by LBJ to obtain the favor of the American people to begin in earnest the
war from which President Kennedy wanted to withdraw. See NSAM (National Security
Action Memorandum) 263 for complete withdrawal which JFK signed and NSAM 273
which LBJ signed two days before JFK's assassination which accelerated the
war literally turning it around with that NSAM signing.
