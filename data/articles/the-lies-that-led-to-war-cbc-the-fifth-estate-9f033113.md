Since the U.S.-led invasion four years ago, the fifth estate has covered Iraq and the war on terror from virtually every angle - the military, media, intelligence, politics - revealing aspects of the story that you didn't find anywhere else.
Now, as the White House warns about the latest threat in the region, this time from Iran, it's worthwhile looking back to examine the deception, suspect intelligence, even lies, that convinced the world of the rightness of targeting Saddam Hussein. The political decisions behind the invasion "The Lies That Led To War" is drawn from these stories:
In 2003's "The Forgotten People", the fifth estate examined the human rights arguments used to make a case for war. We looked at the sale of technology by the US to Iraq during the 1980's despite the fact that this equipment could be, and was used eventually, in military operations by Saddam Hussein against Kurdish civilians. After the gassing of the Kurds in 1988, American business with Iraq actually increased. In the widely acclaimed "Conspiracy Theories" and the "Unauthorized Biography of Dick Cheney", which aired in 2003 and 2004 respectively, we looked at intelligence failures leading up to 9/11, Dick Cheney's power within the White House and his Halliburton connections, as well as the links between the Bush family, the Saudi Royal family and the Bin Ladens. Selling the war in Iraq In 2005's "Sticks and Stones", we turned our attention to the American media and how they covered the ongoing war in Iraq, public dissent, as well as the increasingly hostile tone between left and right in American discourse.

Now, "The Lies That Led To War" provides context to the events of the previous six years, showing how political, diplomatic, media spin - which sometimes crossed the line into outright lies - have been used by the those in power to further their own agendas.
OUR COMMENTS What is a lie?
According to Wikipedia, a lie is a statement made by someone who believes or suspects it to be false, in the expectation that the hearers may believe it.
This film by the CBC, a mainstream Canadian television station, does not accuse the administration of lying but does a good job reminding and explaining some though not all of the inaccuracies that led to war.
We may never have direct evidence that the administration was intentionally lying but there is plenty of evidence that they should have known better.
