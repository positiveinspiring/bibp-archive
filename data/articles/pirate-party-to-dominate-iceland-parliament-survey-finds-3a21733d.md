# Pirate Party to Dominate Iceland Parliament - Survey Finds

The Pirate Party would dominate
Iceland's parliament if elections were held today.
That's the conclusion of a new
survey which found that the Pirates appear to be maintaining an
impressive lead over their rivals, with around 38% of voters
saying they will be voting for the party and kicking the ruling
coalition out of power.
Founded ten years ago by Rick
Falkvinge, over the years the Swedish (and first) Pirate
party grew into a considerable political movement.
Against what some believed were
insurmountable odds, Pirates were even able to put their
representatives into the European Parliament, where German
politician Julia Reda has been a Member since 2014.
While local variants continue to ebb
and flow elsewhere, over in Iceland there's an intriguing
situation playing out which has seen the Pirates transform from
fresh-faced upstart to political powerhouse.
In 2013 (and after just a few months
of existence) the Icelandic Pirate Party picked up a
notable
5.1% of the vote, meaning that the party entered the
national government with three Members of Parliament. But now,
just three years later, a dramatic situation is playing out.
According to the results of a new
poll published Friday, the Icelandic Pirate Party now appears to
count on the support of a staggering 38.1% of the population. To
put that into perspective, that means that if elections were
held today, the party would leap from the three seats it
currently holds to a massive 26 seats.
While all survey results should be
received with caution, if these figures can be maintained it
means that the Pirates would oust the incumbents to become the
most significant player in the country's parliament.
The
survey, carried out by 365 Media, found that The
Independence Party is roughly maintaining the 27.6% of the vote
it achieved in the 2013 elections. However, The Progressives
have dropped from 24.4% to 12.8%.
If that prediction plays out the two
parties combined would plummet from the 38 seats they currently
hold to just 27, meaning that if people went to the polls today
the parties would lose their parliamentary majority.
In fact, as the
Grapevine frames it, not only are the Pirates now the
country's largest political party, but no two-party ruling
coalition could be formed in Iceland without including the
Pirates.
Typically, however, the Icelandic
Pirates are taking the latest poll results in their stride.
Instead of the unbridled celebrations one might expect, they're
remaining ever level-headed.
"I just do not know. I do not
judge it,"
says "shocked" Pirate MP Helgi Hrafn Gunnarsson.
While the Pirates are exercising
caution, the pattern seems clear. In early 2015 the party was
predicted to take
23.9% of the votes, a figure that had swelled to
34.2% last October.
Nevertheless, there is still a way
to go.
Elections don't take place until 2017 and the party has
already made it clear that it is seeking change rather than the
ability to take power.
"We don't really want to govern,
but rather have the system working as a whole where everyone
in it has responsibility for their actions," Pirate MP Ásta
Helgadóttir previously told TF.
