Photos Seen across street after blasts
talking with FBI bomb squad.
Who were they?
What were they and the FBI doing?
Most images were taken from Flickr user
HahaTango,
the entire collection of 150 images from
the Boston Marathon
can be found here.
What appear to be private contractors, wearing unmarked, matching
uniforms and operating an unmarked SUV affixed with communication
equipment near the finish line of the Boston Marathon shortly after
the bomb blasts - can be seen beforehand, standing and waiting just
meters away from where the first bomb was detonated.
The contractor-types had moved away from
the bomb's location before it detonated, and could be seen just
across the street using communication equipment and waiting for
similar dressed and equipped individuals to show up after the
blasts.
An already widely distributed photo showing the
contractor-types on the bottom left, just left of
where the bomb was placed and detonated. The men are
wearing matching, unmarked uniforms, large black
bags, and appear to be waiting, separately, and
"behind" the rest of the crowd. In the upper left
corner, a wooden structure forming one half of a
temporary photography "bridge" over the finish line
can be seen and serves as a useful reference when
establishing the contractor-types' position in other
photos.
After the explosion, two of
the contractors seen by the wall next to the bomb,
appear across the street, both using communication
equipment. This photo too has been distributed and
enlarged many times across the Internet.
An unmarked SUV with a
considerable amount of communication gear on the
roof appears, surrounded by identically dressed men.
The vehicle parks near the bleachers.
Event staff and contractors
both above and below the bleachers begin tearing up
the skirting and appear to be looking for something
or retrieving something while casualties are still
being treated and evacuated across the street.
The men, numbering between 6-8 then
begin tearing up the skirting around temporary bleachers erected for
the event, opposite the explosion, before taping it off.
Then, what appears to be an FBI bomb
squad truck pulls up directly behind the contractor-types' SUV, with
a woman clearly wearing the letters F.B.I. on her tactical
vest emerging and speaking with the contractor-types.
Together they disappear from the scene,
leaving their vehicles behind.
What appears to be an FBI bomb squad truck pulls in,
with a woman wearing what is clearly the letters
F.B.I. on her vest. She talks with two contractors
while it appears a third is partially in the truck's
right-hand side. Also note that the area contractors
and event staff tore up, is now taped off.
The FBI truck and contractor SUV sit seemingly
abandoned - neither the FBI agent, nor the
contractors can be seen. What they did, or where
they went remains so far, unknown.
It should be noted, that with the
exception of the contractor-types, all other responders at the
scene, including the FBI agent, can be clearly identified, from
police to the fire department, to medics and even individuals
wearing vests with "B.A.A. Physician" written on them.
It should also be noted that no other
uniformed individuals can be seen standing near the bomb site aside
from the contractor-types.
These men were unidentified, professional contractors apparently
augmenting public servants at the Boston Marathon, present before
and after the bomb blasts in the direct vicinity of the incident.
After the blasts, whether it was their intended function or not,
they appeared to be searching for something under the bleachers
before being joined by what appears to be the FBI bomb squad.
The FBI and the city of Boston has so
far categorically failed to provide any information on these highly
suspicious individuals.
Questions That
Must be Answered
Several questions must be answered by the FBI, leading the
investigation on behalf of we, the American people.
The first question is who these men
were, with large, black bags in the direct vicinity of where a bomb
would detonate, moving away before the blast, and appearing directly
across the road afterward.
-
Who hired them and what was
their function?
-
Why were they moving amongst the
crowd in a semi-covert fashion when all other public
servants present were wearing proper uniforms and clearly
identified?
-
Did police, firefighters, event
organizers, and medics know these men were present and what
they were doing?
-
Why did it appear that the FBI
was fully aware of their presence, and in fact working with
them, specifically with what looks like a bomb squad unit?
-
Were these contractors
specialists in explosives, and if so, what is the
significance that at least two of them were spotted just
meters from where the blast occurred?
Why
These Questions Demand Answers
The checkered, frightening history (see
'FBI's History of Handing "Terror Suspects" Live Explosives')
of the FBI's involvement in fomenting false terror attacks,
and even presiding over attacks that succeeded in maiming and
killing innocent people, should call into question their presence or
involvement at any public event, especially when seen associating
with unidentified, semi-clandestine organizations that appear to be
private contractors.
Private contractors as well, do not answer or work for the public,
but rather the highest bidder.
Private contractors, most
notably Blackwater and its
various incarnations have operated both domestically and abroad,
committing
obscene crimes and
atrocities with seemingly absolute
impunity.
The term "defense contractor" is in fact
a euphemism for mercenary, and has no place in a civilized,
democratic world, no matter what their alleged mission statement may
claim.
That both of these nefarious entities were present and cooperating
in the direct vicinity of the Boston bombings, with at least two
contractors standing just meters away from where the bomb actually
went off, raises a number of possibilities and concerns.
A drill may have been being conducted,
though the FBI and city officials have denied this. Or, a threat may
have been communicated to event organizers ahead of time, which
prompted the inclusion of "auxiliary" security, though again, both
the FBI and the city of Boston deny receiving any information prior
to the bombings.
Whichever contracting firm this may have
been, may just have wanted to swindle Boston's taxpayers for an easy
payday, and coincidentally found itself in the middle of
extraordinary circumstances.
However, alarming suspicion is raised when the FBI makes no mention
of an organization it was clearly coordinating with, particularly in
terms of bombs and explosives before and after the incident,
considering the nature of the attack.
When an already dubious organization
attempts to obfuscate the facts of any given event, it is the right
and responsibility of legitimate law enforcement, public
representatives and the citizenry itself to demand and get answers.
If we are not persistent, with the
FBI's bizarre behavior over the past few days, including
inexplicably cancelled and suspiciously rushed press conferences,
and now what appears to be a Hollywood ending for the case, we may
never get those answers.

Información
Cuando se sorprende a
alguien cometiendo un delito decimos que lo agarraron con las manos en la
masa.
Bueno, pues eso mismo le ha pasado al Gobierno
norteamericano, que no puede publicar el nombre de la persona que colocó las
bombas en la maratón de Boston por la sencilla razón de que
¡APARECE
RODEADO DE AGENTES DEL GOBIERNO, PROTEGIÉNDOLE!
En el vídeo (arriba), un ya
casi que relajado Alex Jones, ante la innegable evidencia que posee, muestra
las fotos de los agentes militares que protegieron al terrorista que colocó
las bombas en la maratón y aclara, en otra instantánea, la identidad de uno
esos Navy Seals (cuerpos especiales de la marina).
El Jaque Mate es total, como se pueden imaginar, porque si quieren ir por
el terrorista, tendrán que explicar qué hacían esos militares a su lado, que
le dejaron hacer, comenzando por el que está plenamente identificado. (Por
supuesto, militares patriotas han dado la información a Alex Jones).
El
legendario periodista norteamericano esgrime que la causa para el brutal
atentado (y los que se han sucedido) son los cargos de
crímenes contra la
Humanidad contra
Bush,
Cheney,
Obama y
Hillary Clinton que ahora mismo están
sobre la mesa de un tribunal internacional.
Supongo que no hace falta
recalcar más la importancia de esta noticia; para Alex Jones es la más
importante que jamás haya dado.
Indudablemente, es un Jaque Mate...

The suspect was cornered and then arrested.
But what is the real story?
The
real story is the FBI has a history of using informants to stir up mental deficients into bombing targets with fake bombs. That is part of history.
Now the mother of the suspects has said that her son has been followed by
the FBI for at least three years (far below report).
Mother of Boston Bombing Suspects Says FBI Was in
Contact With Her Son

BusinessInsider
Website
Zubeidat K. Tsarnaeva, the mother
of Boston bombing suspects Dzhokar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, suggested
Friday that the FBI had been surveilling her older son for several years
prior to Monday's attack.
In an
interview with Russia Today Friday,
Tsarnaeva said that Tamerlan Tsarnaev got involved in "religious politics"
five years ago, and that the FBI had previously contacted her about her
son's activities.
"He was
controlled by the FBI, like for three, five years," she said.
"They knew
what my son was doing, they knew what actions and what sites on the Internet
he was going [to], they used to come...and talk to me... they were telling me
that he was really a serious leader and they were afraid of him."
"How could
this happen?... They were controlling every step of him, and they are telling
today that this is a terrorist attack," she added.
A spokesperson for the FBI told Business
Insider Friday that the agency would be putting out a statement "shortly"
regarding its previous contact with either of the Tsarnaev suspects.
The
spokesperson would not confirm or deny that the agency had had any previous
contact.
Tsarnaeva doubled down on her statements later
in the interview, insisting that her sons were innocent, and had been "set
up" by the FBI:
"FBI, they
were scared of my oldest son, they always told me that he's a leader... they
are afraid of him because, you know, he is a leader, he talks about Islam a
lot."
"They were
talking to my son, and they called me officially and they told me that my
son is an excellent boy and they have no problem with him," she added.
"At
the same time, they were telling me that... he is getting information on
really extremists... sites, so they were very, very afraid of him. So that's
why I think that this is a setup."
Tamerlan, 26, died Thursday night in a shootout
with Boston Police.
A manhunt is still underway for Tsarnaeva's younger son,
Dzhoker, 19.
Why Were Bomb Sniffing Dogs at Start and Finish Lines?

Interview with college coach who noticed things weren't normal before the
race.
Boston Police
"Don't worry, it's just a training
exercise."
The Boston Police Chief has admitted that
police were conducting drills, and we already knew there was a huge
paramilitary, anti-terrorism presence on scene.
Now we hear of bomb sniffing dogs at the
start and finish lines, spotters on nearby roofs, and repeated
announcements over the loudspeaker that runners and spectators
"shouldn't worry, because this is only a training exercise."
We are simply raising the possibility that the police were tipped about
a bomb threat, and they chose to not inform the public.
It wouldn't be the first time.
NBC 15 Mobile
Coach Saw Bomb Sniffing Dogs,
Roof Spotters, Police Drills Before Explosion
University of Mobiles Cross Country Coach, who was near the finish line
of the Boston Marathon when a series of explosions went off, said he
thought it was odd there were bomb sniffing dogs at the start and finish
lines.
"They kept making announcements to the
participants do not worry, it's just a training exercise," Coach Ali
Stevenson told Local 15.
Stevenson said he saw law enforcement
spotters on the roofs at the start of the race. He's been in plenty of
marathons in Chicago, D.C., Chicago, London and other major metropolitan
areas but has never seen that level of security before.
"Evidently, I don't believe they were
just having a training exercise," Stevenson said. "I think they must
have had some sort of threat or suspicion called in."
Early Evidence Indicates Boston Bombing Was a False Flag
by Brandon Turbeville
April 15, 2013
from
BrandonTurbeville.Blogspot Website
Only hours after two bombs were detonated near the finish line of a Boston
marathon, evidence is beginning to emerge suggesting that the act may have
been a false flag attack.
While reports continue to emerge from the scene, a number of facts point
toward the typical setup used to devise, control, and execute such an attack
as took place around the 9/11, 7/7, and OKC bombings as well as the Aurora
and Sandy Hook shootings.
One of the hallmark signals of a false flag attack, as Webster Tarpley has
expertly demonstrated in his book,
9/11 Synthetic Terror, is the use of
drills acting as a cover for sinister plans and mechanizations within the
halls of the shadow government itself which ultimately manifest as false
flag terror attacks.
Much like the aforementioned attacks, the Boston
Bombing also carried the trademark coincidence of a drill scheduled to
take place at almost exactly the same time that the bombs were being
detonated at the marathon.
For instance, earlier in the morning of April 15, 2013, the
Boston Globe tweeted,
Officials:
There will be a controlled explosion opposite the library within one minute
as part of bomb squad activities.
(Note:
it has subsequently come to light that the Boston Globe tweet actually
occurred 54 minutes after the tweet about the two bombings. The
reference to a "controlled explosion" was in fact a reference to the
detonation of a secondary device.)
In addition, it was reported by
Business Insider
that a police scanner,
said police were going to do a third, controlled
explosion on the 600 Block of Boylston Street.
Yet, despite the fact that the police had
scheduled a highly coincidental explosion at the JFK Library, much of the
mainstream reports regarding the device have presented it as another part of
the Boston Bombing itself.
In fact, the New York Post
reported almost the polar opposite of the Boston
Globe in regards to the second device.
It said,
Police confirmed a third
explosion at JFK Library in Boston. Boston fire officials confirmed during a
press conference that the third explosion was linked to the ones that
occurred at the Marathon. There were no injuries reported from the third
bombing.
Andrew Katz of TIME tweeted
,
police were investigating reports of bombs
in other parts of the city, and Citing a police scanner, Katz tweeted that
there was an incendiary device possible at JFK Library as well as another
device in front of Bostons luxury Mandarin Hotel.
Business Insider also reported that, around 3 p.m., there was a fire inside
the JFK Library but states that it was not related to the terrorist
bombings.
This, as I mentioned, is in direct contradiction to the later
reports that the fire was actually an explosion related to the terror
bombing.
Thus, we have a device planted inside the library by the police and
confirmation that an explosion at the library was connected to the Boston
Bombing. This fact alone should be enough to raise questions regarding the
individuals responsible for the bombing. If the police had planted a device
inside the Library and the explosion was related to the Boston Bombing,
should there not be an immediate investigation of the police?
It should also be noted that Chris Faraone of the Boston Phoenix also
tweeted that a police officer near the finish line stated,
There are
secondary devices that have been found and are unexploded.
Also interesting, however, is the fact that the University of Mobiles Cross
Country Coach, Ali Stevenson, stated that bomb
sniffing dogs were present at
both the start and finish lines.
Speaking to Local 15, the local
Boston news station, Stevenson stated,
They kept making announcements on
the loud speaker that it was just a drill and there was nothing to worry
about. It seemed like there was some sort of threat, but they kept telling
us it was just a drill.
At this time, law enforcement officials state that they have identified a
suspect, a Saudi national currently in the hospital for shrapnel wounds.
One
must also wonder if this individual is nothing more than a mere patsy in yet
another
government-sponsored false flag. It is highly dubious that an
individual (with the exception of a suicide bomber which this individuals
survival excludes him from) setting off such powerful bombs would stand so
close to them as to be injured by shrapnel.
Ali Stevenson also stated that there was no doubt in his mind that the
bombings were intentional and this much is quite clear.
The question, however, is who was behind them?
As Mike Adams of Natural News
writes,
Its far too early to take an informed guess on all this. However, it is
indisputable that the FBI is actively engaged in carrying out bomb plots
in the United States, then halting them at the last minute to 'catch the
terrorists.'
This fact has been covered by
the New York Times, among other
publications.
Indeed...
And the track record of the FBI, as well as other elements of the
governmental establishment, should be reason enough for us to continue
watching these developments and the subsequent claims made by these agencies
and individuals.
