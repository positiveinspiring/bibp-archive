Back in 2008, at the onset of the derivatives
and credit collapse, I wrote several economic editorials discussing what I
saw as the single most vital trend in the global fiscal system, and how it
would cause a disastrous upheaval that would leave the U.S. and the dollar
financially sunk.
This trend, which seemed to take serious root in
2005, was the massive shift by China from an export dependent source of
cheap manufacturing and labor, into a moderate exporter, and consumer hub,
and currency powerhouse.
In my view at the time, the evidence suggested that
China was positioning itself to decouple from its dependence on U.S. markets
and the dollar. I was, of course, attacked as a doom monger and
conspiracy theorist.
Five years later, the critics have changed their
tune
For the past decade, China has been slowly but surely issuing Yuan
denominated bonds and securities around the globe, while simultaneously
forming bilateral trade agreements with multiple nations and cutting out the
U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency. This process has gone mostly
ignored by the mainstream financial media.
However, I and many other independent analysts
could not overlook the red flags. I tried to summarize as much of the
situation and facts as I could in my article How The U.S. Dollar Will Be
Replaced, which was published in May of last year.
The biggest question for me was, if China is one of the largest holders of
Forex reserves on the planet, and had the largest savings of any nation,
They certainly didnt need the money.
-
Why were they moving away from export dependency
and building a consumer base?
-
And why attempt to proliferate their currency?
-
Wouldnt the pursuit of global Yuan circulation lead to an eventual increase
in valuation?
-
Didnt the Chinese want their currency cheap so that they
could maintain export superiority?
-
What did the Chinese know in 2005 that we
didnt?
Well, apparently they were either psychic, or SOMEONE gave them advanced
warning.
They knew that there would be a crisis in
American consumption and that this would lead to severe reduction in
imports, which is why they began building trade deals within the ASEAN
trading bloc to insulate themselves.
They knew that there would be considerable
devaluation in the dollar, which is why they converted much of their long
term treasury holdings to short term treasury bonds that they could dump
with far more ease, and they knew that the IMF would be promoting Special
Drawing Rights as a new reserve replacing the dollar, which is why they have
been spreading the Yuan everywhere, earning them favor with
the global banksters and inclusion in the basket currency.
In fact, China has been
pumping Yuan into global
markets even faster than the Federal Reserve has been printing
the dollar.
China is flooding the system with Yuan! This means only one thing; China is
no longer seeking to maintain the traditional trade relationship it has had
with the U.S.
To make my case even more clear, I would point out that China has not only
become the worlds largest gold producer, but also its largest BUYER,
recently surpassing India. Official estimates place Chinese gold purchases
in 2012 at around 800 tons; an astonishing increase in their stockpile.
The U.S. and the Federal Reserve cant even deliver gold it is supposed to
be holding for others, including Germany.
China has also recently quadrupled imports of rice and tripled wheat and
corn imports in only one year. Why? Again, I ask, what do they know that
we
are not being told?
As I have stated for many years, China is being groomed as an alternative
economic engine in opposition to the U.S., and that this will lead to an
eventual dump by them of the Greenback.
This scenario is not only based on my opinion,
it has also been spoken of openly by elitist financiers, including
George
Soros:
This past month, the same plan has been
reiterated by Zhu Min, the deputy managing director of
the IMF.
In his statement, he proclaimed that the shift
by China into a more consumer based system had been successful, and that the
Yuan or RMB, was on the way to
becoming a world reserve currency.
I believe that the moment for the epic changeover, and all the political and
financial conflict that comes with it, has begun
It has been announced this week that
China surpassed the U.S. for the first
time ever as the number one trading power in the world:
U.S. exports and imports last year totaled $3.82 trillion, the U.S. Commerce
Department said last week. Chinas customs administration reported last
month that the countrys total trade in 2012 amounted to $3.87 trillion.
China had a $231.1 billion annual trade surplus
while the U.S. had a trade deficit of $727.9 billion:
It is remarkable that an economy that is
only a fraction of the size of the U.S. economy has a larger trading
volume, Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics in Washington, said in an e-mail.
The surpassing of the U.S. is not because
of a substantially undervalued currency that has led to an export boom,
said Lardy, noting that Chinese imports have grown more rapidly than
exports since 2007.
According to ONeill (Goldman Sachs Jim ONeill), the trade figures
underscore the need to draw China further into the global financial and
trading architecture that the U.S. helped create.
One way or another we have to get China more involved in the global
organizations of today and the future despite some of their own
reluctance, ONeill said, mentioning Chinas inclusion in the
International Monetary Funds Special Drawing Rights currency basket.
To not have China more symbolically and
more importantly actually central to all these things is just
increasingly silly.
For those who are still not aware of why this is
such a big deal, it is essentially a turning point moment in global trade.
There is no doubt that China will now be
inducted into the SDR, and that their importance as a trade and consumption
center will quickly lead to a move away from the dollar.
To put it simply,
the dollar is going to lose its world reserve status VERY soon. Many will
cheer this change as necessary progress towards a more globally conscious
economic system.
However, its not that simple.
Total
centralization is first and foremost the dream of idiots, and in any
mutation (or amputation) there is always considerable pain involved. The
proponents of this New World Order (their words, not mine) seem to have
placed the U.S. squarely in their crosshairs as the primary recipient of
this fiscal pain.
In my early analysis, I felt it possible that Japan would be inducted
willingly into the new ASEAN trading bloc and that they would swiftly fall
in line with a dump of the dollar, mainly because their export markets were
suffering greatly due to the decline in American purchases.
Now it appears that Japan has not been as
pliable as the globalists wanted, and so, a war may be on the table in the
Pacific.
Rhetoric in Chinese newspapers has been very heated and provocative, and the
tensions surrounding the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands is reaching a boiling point.
The two countries have done everything so far EXCEPT shoot at each other,
and that will be happening in due course now that China is allegedly locking
offensive radar onto Japanese ships.
Even Chinese films released in the past two
years have been soaked with anti-Japan propaganda, most of them usually set
during WWII around the brutal invasion and subjugation by the Japanese in
Chinese provinces.
The recipe is one of inevitable disaster, with the U.S. at the center of a
boiling pot.
As I pointed in my last economic piece, we must now look to
events rather than numbers to gain insight into where we are headed. The
time has come. China is nearly ready for IMF inclusion. Volatility around
the world is high. Our government has a final decision to make on the Fiscal
Cliff in March, not to mention the sudden push for possible gun registration
and confiscation.
My instincts tell me that so many explosive
aspects coalescing together at the same tenuous moment is not a coincidence.
The next few months call for hyper-vigilance and every ounce of energy we
can muster to educate as many people as possible in as short a time as
possible.
I say again, China has surpassed the U.S. in global trade.
A drop of the dollar is the obvious next step
