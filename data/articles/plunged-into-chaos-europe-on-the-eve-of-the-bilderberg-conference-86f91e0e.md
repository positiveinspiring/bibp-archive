The Bilderberg group will convene in Sitges,
Spain, a resort community 30 km from Barcelona, on June 4-7, 2010.
As usual, the
information is supplied by James Tucker and Daniel Estulin who revealed that
this year the issues topping the agenda of the club's meeting will be the
global recession and the approaches to provoking such economic breakdowns
that can help justify the establishment of a full-scale world economic
governance.
Intending to prolong the global economic downturn for at least another year,
the Bilderberg group hopes to take advantage of the situation to set up a
global ministry of finance as a part of the UN. Though the decision was
actually made at the group's meeting in Greece last year, according to
Tucker the plan was torpedoed by US and European nationalists (for the Bilderberg group, nationalists is a generic term for all
nationally-oriented forces espousing national sovereignty and statehood).
All year since the last meeting, representatives of the global executive
management have been convincing the public across the world to embrace a
new financial order.
The idea recurred in the statements made by N. Sarkozy,
G. Brown, and the freshly elected European Council President H. Van Rompuy, but - against the backdrop of a relatively harmless phase of the
crisis - the activity remained limited to psychological conditioning and no
practical steps have been taken.
As Jacques Attali wrote quite reasonably in
his After the Crisis, Europe has no right to demand a reform of the global
financial architecture as long as it can't organize the institutions that
would meet its own needs.
The debt crisis in Greece that currently puts in jeopardy the entire
European financial system provides a pretext for drastic measures, and both
the crisis and the measures are vivid illustrations of the strategy that
employs chaos to reorder the existing arrangements.
The deliberately
generated chaos is tightly controlled by financial institutions, major
banks, and hedge funds and serves as an efficient mechanism of governance
and social restructuring.
The
financial attack against Greece promptly evolved into onslaught on Euro
and - as it became clear - the developments correlated marginally with the
structural shortcomings of the Greek economy. The intensity of the crisis
that momentarily posed a threat to the economic and even political integrity
of the EU cannot be explained solely by the appetites of faceless financial
players.
There had to be more serious reasons behind the situation, and to
an extent the objectives pursued by those who shaped it can be understood
from the statements made by
George Soros.
He maintains that the EU owes its
current difficulties to the European (especially German) politicians'
reluctance to move on, that huge problems await Europe unless it starts
developing, and that a kind of a European Monetary Fund helping fight budget
deficit must be created. In other words, Europeans are forced to choose
between the collapse of the Eurozone and governance centralization.
Jacques Attali laid out a specific centralization plan. It is suggested that
the EU countries create their own institutions to monitor the activities of
financial operators.
It is also proposed that they should set up a European
creditor of a new formation that - while not being linked to Europe's
central and investment banks or governments - would guarantee assistance to
viable local financial institutions, buy into their assets, and extend loans
under specific terms.
Attali further advocates the formation of a European
ministry of finance that would immediately be empowered to hand out loans
from the name of the EU, and the creation of a European Budget Fund with a
mandate to oversee the budgets of the countries whose cumulative dept totals
over 85% of the GDP. He warns that an even severer crisis should be expected
otherwise.
Under the US pressure, A. Merkel finally consented to tough measures
(purportedly, Sarkozy even threatened that France would revert to national
currency in case she held her own), and early last May EU finance and
economy ministers signed an agreement on the mechanisms of budgetary
stabilization in the Euro zone, which envisaged the establishment of a Euro
60b safety pillow fund to urgently rescue countries battling with their
public finances and the allocation of Euro 440b in guaranteed loans.
The IMF
also pledged Euro 250b in the case of need. The money is meant for sovereign
debt bailouts in the Eurozone, a mission which - for the first time in its
entire history - the European central bank will also undertake. Steps
facilitating financial transactions were announced by central banks across
the world including the US Federal Reserve which will urgently inject US
dollars into the European Central Bank as well as into British and Swiss
banks.
The above can be regarded as the first phase of progress towards centralized
European monetary administration. It is unclear so far how exactly the
grand architects see the world financial governance and what role they
plan to give to existing financial institutions like
the IMF.
The options on
the table range from building totally new institutions to - as, for example,
suggested by Attali - using the IMF as an authorized supranational
regulation center run by a G-24 board.
Importantly, once again we are witnessing the creation of mechanisms of
centralized supranational control over national economies, and the crisis
acts as a catalyst for a guided fast transition to tighter integration
within the EU, which is necessary to build a close-knit Western bloc.
The plan imposed on Europe by elite financial circles implies countering the
indebtedness problem with the help of new borrowings, which will exacerbate
rather than remedy the budget problem.
According to
Eurostat data, in 2010
the Eurozone sovereign debt will grow from 77.7% to 83.6% of the GDP.
Moreover, it is widely held in the expert community that the indebtedness
figures for Greece, Portugal, and a number of other EU countries are
unrealistically low and do not reflect the actual proportions of the
problem.
Experts from Lombard Odier, a Swiss bank, estimate the bulk of Greek bad
debt at 875% of its GDP, which means that to meet its obligations the
country would have to invest - without any foreseeable returns - an amount
exceeding its GDP by a factor of 8.75.
The situations in Poland and Slovenia
are even more alarming - in their cases the debt to GDP ratio is 15 and 11
respectively. The corresponding average over the Eurozone is 4.34, and in
the US - 5.
Leaving structural problems untouched, the mitigation measures are paving
the way for the supranational institutions advocated by mondialist Attali.
On May 21, the EU finance ministers adopted at a meeting chaired by European
Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet and European Council President
H.
Van Rompuy the German plan of much greater budgetary coordination including
penalties for states that break the EU budgetary rules. The sanctions will
include suspending the voting rights of repeat offenders, withholding the
funding for infrastructural development, etc.
It was also proposed to
subject national budgets to EU screening prior to their being debated in
national legislatures. A report will be prepared by June 17 - notably, the
date of the EU summit - outlining a common Eurozone policy. Other, yet more
ambitious projects like full control over Eurozone national budgets by a
triumvirate comprising the European Commission, the European central bank,
and the Euro Group are also discussed.
The downsides of the rescue packages are the worst part of the problem.
Invoking the threat of financial collapse, the EU countries serially
introduced extremely unpopular austerity regimes with salary and pension
freezes for state employees, welfare cuts, increased retirement ages, etc.
-
Greece was the first but not the only country affected.
-
The German government plans to cut spending by Euro 10b annually in
2011-2016.
-
France abolished the annual pension for low-income families.
-
Under the IMF pressure, Spain is launching a comprehensive reform including
pension indexing freeze, pay reductions and employment cuts in the state
sector, the abolition of payments to support families with recently born
children, etc.
-
Great Britain, Italy, and others are following the lead.
The consequences of the measures are hard to gauge considering that Europe
is already facing serious poverty and unemployment problems (the
unemployment has reached 10% of the economically active population and
continues to grow, and at least 80 million people are currently below the
poverty line).
Most likely, the
shadow world government - the Bilderberg group - will
administer to the public the doze of social problems carefully calculated to
enable the elites to offload troubled assets, retain control over the
situation, and divert protests from the actual sources of problems that
trigger them.
From Russia's perspective, the conclusion is obvious:
any deepening of its
integration into the free Europe strengthens the financial and
informational control over Russia exercised by the global elites seeking to
strip it of the status of an independent geopolitical player.
