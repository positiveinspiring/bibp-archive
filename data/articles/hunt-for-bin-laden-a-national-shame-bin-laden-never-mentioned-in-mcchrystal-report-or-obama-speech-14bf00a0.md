Conservative commentator, former Marine Colonel
Bob Pappas has been saying for years that bin Laden died at Tora
Bora and that Senator Kerry's claim that bin Laden escaped with Bush
help was a lie.
Now we know that Pappas was correct. The
embarrassment of having Secretary of State Clinton talk about
bin Laden in Pakistan was horrific.
He has been dead since December 13, 2001
and now, finally, everyone, Obama, McChrystal, Cheney, everyone who isn't
nuts is finally saying what they have known for years.
-
However, since we lost a couple of
hundred of our top special operations forces hunting for bin Laden
after we knew he was dead, is someone going to answer for this with
some jail time?
-
Since we spent 200 million dollars on
"special ops" looking for someone we knew was dead, who is going to
jail for that?
-
Since
Bush, Rumsfeld and Cheney
continually talked about a man they knew was dead, now known to be
for reasons of POLITICAL nature, who is going to jail for that?
-
Why were tapes brought out, now known to
be forged, as legitimate intelligence to sway the disputed 2004
election in the US?
This is a criminal act if there ever was one.
-
In 66 pages, General Stanley
McChrystal never mentions Osama bin Laden. Everything is
"Mullah Omar" now.
-
In his talk at West Point, President
Obama never mentioned Osama bin Laden.
-
Col. Pappas makes it clear, Vice
President
Cheney let it "out of the bag"
long ago.
Bin Laden was killed by American troops
many
many years ago.
America knew Osama bin Laden died December 13, 2001. After that, his use was
hardly one to unite America but rather one to divide, scam and play games.
With bin Laden gone, we could have started legitimate nation building in
Afghanistan instead of the eternal insurgency that we invented ourselves.
Without our ill informed policies, we could have had a brought diplomatic
solution in 2002 in Afghanistan, the one we are ignoring now, and spent
money rebuilding the country, 5 cents on the dollar compared to what we are
spending fighting a war against an enemy we ourselves recruited thru
ignorance.
The bin Laden scam is one of the most shameful acts ever perpetrated
against the American people. We don't even know if he really was an enemy,
certainly he was never the person that
Bush and Cheney said. In fact, the Bush and bin Laden
families were always close friends and had been for many years.
What kind of man was Osama bin Laden? This one time American ally against
Russia, son of a wealthy Saudi family, went to Afghanistan to help them
fight for their freedom. America saw him as a great hero then. Transcripts
of the real bin Laden show him to be much more moderate than we claim, angry
at Israel and the US government but showing no anger toward Americans and
never making the kind of threats claimed.
All of this is public record for
any with the will to learn.
How much of America's tragedy is tied with these
two children of the rich, children of families long joined thru money and
friendship, the Bush and bin Laden clans.
One son died in remote mountains, another lives in a Dallas suburb hoping
nobody is sent after him. One is a combat veteran, one never took a strong
stand unless done from safety and comfort. Islam once saw bin Laden as a
great leader.
Now he is mostly forgotten.
What has America
decided about Bush?
We know this: Bin Laden
always denied any ties to 9/11 and, in fact, has never been charged in
relation to 9/11. He not only denied involvement, but had done so, while
alive, 4 times and had vigorously condemned those who were involved in the
attack.
This is on the public record, public in every free country except ours. We,
instead, showed films
made by paid actors, made up to look somewhat similar to bin Laden,
actors who contradicted bin Laden's very public statements, actors
pretending to be bin Laden long after bin Laden's death.
These were done to help justify spending, repressive laws, torture and
simple thievery.
For years, we attacked the government of Pakistan for not hunting down
someone everyone knew was dead. Bin Laden's death hit the newspapers in
Pakistan on December 15, 2001.
-
How do you think our ally felt when they
were continually berated for failing to hunt down and turn over
someone who didn't exist?
-
What do you think this did for American
credibility in Pakistan and thru the Islamic world?
-
Were we seen as criminals, liars or
simply fools?
-
Which one is best?
This is also
treason.
-
How does the death of bin Laden and the
defeat and dismemberment of Al Qaeda impact the intelligence
assessments, partially based on, not only bin Laden but Al Qaeda
activity in Iraq that, not only never happened but was now known to
have been unable to happen?
-
How many "Pentagon Pundits," the retired
officers who sold their honor to send us to war for what is now
known to be domestic political dirty tricks and not national
security are culpable in these crimes?
I don't always agree with Col. Pappas on things.
I believe his politics overrule his judgment at times. However, we totally
agree on bin Laden, simply disagree with what it means.
To me lying and sending men to their deaths
based on lies is treason.
Falsifying military intelligence and spending billions on unnecessary
military operations for political reasons is an abomination. Consider this,
giving billions in contracts to GOP friends who fill campaign coffers, and
doing so based on falsified intelligence is insane. This was done for years.
We spent 8 years chasing a dead man, spending billions, sending FBI agents,
the CIA, Navy Seals, Marine Force Recon, Special Forces, many to their
deaths, as part of a political campaign to justify running American into
debt, enriching a pack of political cronies and war profiteers and to puff
up a pack of Pentagon peacocks and their Whitehouse draft dodging bosses.
-
How many laws were pushed thru because
of a dead man?
-
How many hundreds were tortured to find
a dead man?
-
How many hundreds died looking for a
dead man?
-
How many billions were spent looking for
a dead man?
Every time Bush, Cheney and
Rumsfeld stood before troops and talked about hunting down the dead bin
Laden, it was a dishonor. Lying to men and women who put their lives
on the line is not a joke.
Who is going to answer to the families of those who died for the politics
and profit tied to the Hunt for Bin Laden?
