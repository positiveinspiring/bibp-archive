# The Trans-Pacific Partnership Clause Everyone Should Oppose

The United States is in the final stages
of negotiating the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a
massive free-trade agreement with Mexico, Canada, Japan, Singapore
and seven other countries.
Who will benefit from the TPP?
One strong hint is buried in the fine
print of the closely guarded draft.
The provision, an increasingly common
feature of trade agreements, is called "Investor-State Dispute
Settlement," or
ISDS.
The name may sound mild, but don't be
fooled. Agreeing to ISDS in this enormous new treaty would tilt the
playing field in the United States further in favor of big
multinational corporations. Worse, it would undermine U.S.
sovereignty.
ISDS would allow foreign companies to
challenge U.S. laws - and potentially to pick up huge payouts from
taxpayers - without ever stepping foot in a U.S. court.
Here's how it would work.
Imagine that the United States bans a
toxic chemical that is often added to gasoline because of its health
and environmental consequences. If a foreign company that makes the
toxic chemical opposes the law, it would normally have to challenge
it in a U.S. court.
But with ISDS, the company could skip
the U.S. courts and go before an international panel of arbitrators.
If the company won, the ruling couldn't
be challenged in U.S. courts, and the arbitration panel could
require American taxpayers to cough up millions - and even billions
- of dollars in damages.
If that seems shocking, buckle your seat
belt. ISDS could lead to gigantic fines, but it
wouldn't employ independent judges.
Instead, highly paid corporate lawyers
would go back and forth between representing corporations one day
and sitting in judgment the next. Maybe that makes sense in an
arbitration between two corporations, but not in cases between
corporations and governments.
If you're a lawyer looking to maintain
or attract high-paying corporate clients, how likely are you to rule
against those corporations when it's your turn in the judge's seat?
If the tilt toward giant corporations wasn't clear enough, consider
who would get to use this special court: only international
investors, which are, by and large, big corporations.
So if a Vietnamese company with U.S.
operations wanted to challenge an increase in the U.S. minimum wage,
it could use ISDS.
But if an American labor union believed
Vietnam was allowing Vietnamese companies to pay slave wages in
violation of trade commitments, the union would have to make its
case in the Vietnamese courts.
Nothing, actually...
But after World War II, some investors
worried about plunking down their money in developing countries,
where the legal systems were not as dependable. They were concerned
that a corporation might build a plant one day only to watch a
dictator confiscate it the next.
To encourage foreign investment in
countries with weak legal systems, the United States and other
nations began to include ISDS in trade agreements.
Those justifications don't make sense
anymore, if they ever did. Countries in the TPP are hardly emerging
economies with weak legal systems. Australia and Japan have
well-developed, well-respected legal systems, and multinational
corporations navigate those systems every day, but ISDS would
preempt their courts too.
And to the extent there are countries
that are riskier politically, market competition can solve the
problem.
Countries that respect property rights
and the rule of law - such as the United States - should be
more competitive, and if a company wants to invest in a country with
a weak legal system, then it should buy political-risk insurance.
The use of ISDS is on the rise around
the globe. From 1959 to 2002, there were fewer than 100 ISDS claims
worldwide. But in 2012 alone, there were
58 cases.
Recent cases include,
-
a French company that sued Egypt
because Egypt raised its minimum wage
-
a Swedish company that
sued Germany because
Germany decided to phase out nuclear power after Japan's
Fukushima disaster
-
a Dutch company that sued the
Czech Republic because the Czechs didn't bail out a bank
that the company partially owned
U.S. corporations have also gotten in on
the action:
Philip Morris is trying to use
ISDS to stop Uruguay from implementing new tobacco regulations
intended to cut smoking rates.
ISDS advocates point out that, so far,
this process hasn't harmed the United States.
And our negotiators, who refuse
to share the text of the TPP publicly, assure us
that it will include a bigger, better version of ISDS that will
protect our ability to regulate in the public interest. But with the
number of ISDS cases exploding and more and more multinational
corporations headquartered abroad, it is only a matter of time
before such a challenge does serious damage here.
Replacing the U.S. legal system with a
complex and unnecessary alternative - on the assumption that nothing
could possibly go wrong - seems like a really bad idea
This isn't a partisan issue.
Conservatives who believe in U.S. sovereignty should be outraged
that ISDS would shift power from American courts, whose authority is
derived from our Constitution, to unaccountable international
tribunals.
Libertarians should be offended that
ISDS effectively would offer a free taxpayer subsidy to countries
with weak legal systems. And progressives should oppose ISDS because
it would allow big multinationals to weaken labor and environmental
rules.
Giving foreign corporations special
rights to challenge our laws outside of our legal system would be a
bad deal.
If a final TPP agreement includes
Investor-State Dispute Settlement, the only winners will be
multinational corporations.
