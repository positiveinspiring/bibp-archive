Afghanistan is, by far, the largest grower and exporter of opium in the
world today, cultivating a 92 percent market share of the global opium
trade.
But what may shock many is the fact that the
U.S. military has been specifically tasked with guarding Afghan poppy
fields, from which opium is derived, in order to protect this multibillion
dollar industry that enriches Wall Street,
the CIA, MI6, and various other
groups that profit big time from this illicit drug trade scheme.
Prior to the tragic
events of September 11, 2001, Afghanistan was hardly
even a world player in growing poppy, which is used to produce both illegal
heroin and pharmaceutical-grade morphine.
In fact, the Taliban had been
actively destroying poppy fields as part of an effort to rid the country of
this harmful plant, as was reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on
February 16, 2001, in a piece entitled
Nation's opium production virtually wiped out.
But after 9/11,
the U.S. military-industrial complex quickly invaded
Afghanistan and began facilitating the reinstatement of the country's poppy
industry.
According to the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP),
opium cultivation increased by 657 percent
in 2002 after the U.S. military invaded the country under the direction of
then-President
George W. Bush.

More recently, The New York Times (NYT)
reported that the brother of current
Afghan President Hamid Karzai had actually been on the payroll of the CIA
for at least eight years prior to this information going public in 2009.
Ahmed Wali Karzai was a crucial player in
reinstating the country's opium drug trade, known as Golden Crescent, and
the CIA had been financing the endeavor
behind the scenes.
"The Golden Crescent drug trade, launched by the CIA in the early 1980s,
continues to be protected by U.S. intelligence, in liaison with NATO
occupation forces and the British military," wrote Prof. Michel Chossudovsky
in a 2007 report, before it was revealed that Ahmed Wali Karzai was on the
CIA payroll.
"The proceeds of this lucrative multibillion dollar contraband
are deposited in Western banks. Almost the totality of revenues accrue to
corporate interests and criminal syndicates outside Afghanistan."

But the mainstream media has been peddling a different story to the American
public.
FOX News, for instance, aired a propaganda piece back in 2010
claiming that military personnel are having to protect the Afghan poppy
fields, rather than destroy them, in order to keep the locals happy and to
avoid a potential "security risk" - and FOX News reporter Geraldo Rivera
can be heard blatantly lying about poppy farmers being financially supported
by the Taliban, rather than the CIA and other foreign interests.

So while tens of thousands of Americans continue to be harmed or killed
every year by overdoses from drugs originating from this illicit opium
trade, and while cultivation of innocuous crops like marijuana and hemp
remains illegal in the U.S., the American military is actively guarding the
very poppy fields in Afghanistan that fuel the global drug trade.
Something
is terribly wrong with this picture...
