# Forty Two Admitted False Flag Attacks - Governments from Around the World 
Admit They Do It

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_falseflag26.htm

(1) Japanese troops set
off a small explosion on a train
track in 1931, and falsely
blamed it on China in order to
justify an invasion of
Manchuria.
This is
known as the "Mukden
Incident" or the "Manchurian
Incident".
The
Tokyo
International Military Tribunal
found:
"Several of the
participators in the plan,
including Hashimoto [a
high-ranking Japanese army
officer], have on various
occasions
admitted their part
in the plot and have stated that
the object of the 'Incident' was
to afford an excuse for the
occupation of Manchuria by the
Kwantung Army..."
And
see this.
(2) A major with the
Nazi SS
admitted at the Nuremberg
trials that - under orders from
the chief of the Gestapo - he
and some other Nazi operatives
faked attacks on their own
people and resources which they
blamed on the Poles, to justify
the invasion of Poland.
(3) Nazi general
Franz Halder also testified at the
Nuremberg trials that Nazi
leader Hermann Goering
admitted to setting fire to
the German parliament building
in 1933, and then falsely
blaming the communists for the
arson.
(4) Soviet leader
Nikita
Khrushchev
admitted in writing that the
Soviet Union's Red Army shelled
the Russian village of Mainila
in 1939 - while blaming the
attack on Finland - as a basis
for launching the "Winter War"
against Finland.
Russian
president Boris Yeltsin
agreed that Russia had been
the aggressor in the Winter War.
(5) The Russian
Parliament, current Russian
president Putin and former
Soviet leader Gorbachev all
admit that Soviet leader
Joseph Stalin ordered his secret
police to execute 22,000 Polish
army officers and civilians in
1940, and falsely blame it on
the Nazis.
(6) The British
government
admits that - between 1946
and 1948 - it bombed 5 ships
carrying Jews attempting to flee
the Holocaust to seek safety in
Palestine, set up a fake group
called "Defenders of Arab
Palestine", and then had the
pseudo-group falsely claim
responsibility for the bombings
(and see this,
this and
this).
(7) Israel
admits that in 1954, an
Israeli terrorist cell operating
in Egypt planted bombs in
several buildings, including
U.S. diplomatic facilities, then
left behind "evidence"
implicating the Arabs as the
culprits (one of the bombs
detonated prematurely, allowing
the Egyptians to identify the
bombers, and several of the
Israelis later confessed) (and
see
this and
this).
(8) The CIA
admits that it hired
Iranians in the 1950â€²s to pose
as Communists and stage bombings
in Iran in order to turn the
country against its
democratically-elected prime
minister.
(9) The Turkish Prime
Minister
admitted that the Turkish
government carried out the 1955
bombing on a Turkish consulate
in Greece - also damaging the
nearby birthplace of the founder
of modern Turkey - and blamed it
on Greece, for the purpose of
inciting and justifying
anti-Greek violence.
(10) The British Prime
Minister
admitted to his defense
secretary that he and American
president Dwight Eisenhower
approved a plan in 1957 to carry
out attacks in Syria and blame
it on the Syrian government as a
way to effect regime change.
(11) The former Italian
Prime Minister, an Italian
judge, and the
former head of Italian
counterintelligence admit
that
NATO, with the help of
the Pentagon and CIA,
carried out
terror bombings in Italy and
other European countries in
the 1950s and blamed the
communists, in order to
rally people's support
for their governments in
Europe in their fight
against communism.
As one
participant in this
formerly-secret program
stated:
"You had to attack civilians,
people, women, children,
innocent people, unknown people
far removed from any political
game. The reason was quite
simple. They were supposed to
force these people, the Italian
public, to turn to the state to
ask for greater security"
(and see
this)
(Italy and other
European countries subject to
the terror campaign had joined
NATO before the bombings
occurred).
And watch
this BBC special.
They also
allegedly
carried out terror
attacks in
France, Belgium, Denmark,
Germany, Greece, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
the UK, and other countries.
(12) In 1960, American
Senator George Smathers
suggested that the U.S.
launch,
"a false attack made on
Guantanamo Bay which would give
us the excuse of actually
fomenting a fight which would
then give us the excuse to go in
and [overthrow Castro]".
(13) Official State
Department documents show that,
in 1961, the head of the Joint
Chiefs and other high-level
officials
discussed blowing up a
consulate in the Dominican
Republic in order to justify an
invasion of that country.
The
plans were not carried out, but
they were all discussed as
serious proposals.
(14) As admitted by the
U.S. government, recently
declassified documents show that
in 1962, the American Joint
Chiefs of Staff signed off on a
plan to
blow up
AMERICAN airplanes
(using an elaborate plan
involving the switching of
airplanes), and also to
commit terrorist acts
on
American soil, and
then to blame it on the Cubans
in order to justify an invasion
of Cuba.
See the following
ABC news report;
the official documents; and
watch
this interview with the
former Washington Investigative
Producer for ABC's World News
Tonight with Peter Jennings.
(15) In 1963, the U.S.
Department of Defense wrote a
paper
promoting attacks on nations
within the Organization of
American States - such as
Trinidad-Tobago or Jamaica - and
then falsely blaming them on
Cuba.
(16) The U.S. Department
of Defense even
suggested covertly paying a
person in the Castro government
to attack the United States:
"The only area remaining for
consideration then would be to
bribe one of Castro's
subordinate commanders to
initiate an attack on
Guantanamo."
(17) The NSA
admits that it
lied about what really
happened in the
Gulf of Tonkin incident in
1964... manipulating data to
make it look like North
Vietnamese boats fired on a U.S.
ship so as to create a false
justification for the Vietnam
war.
(18) A U.S.
Congressional committee
admitted that - as part of
its "Cointelpro" campaign - the
FBI had used many provocateurs
in the 1950s through 1970s to
carry out violent acts and
falsely blame them on political
activists.
(19) A
top Turkish general
admitted that Turkish forces
burned down a mosque on Cyprus
in the 1970s and blamed it on
their enemy.
He
explained:
"In Special War,
certain acts of sabotage are
staged and blamed on the enemy
to increase public resistance.
We did this on Cyprus; we even
burnt down a mosque."
In
response to the surprised
correspondent's incredulous look
the general said,
"I am giving
an example".
(20) The German
government
admitted (and
see this) that, in 1978, the
German secret service detonated
a bomb in the outer wall of a
prison and planted "escape
tools" on a prisoner - a member
of the Red Army Faction - which
the secret service wished to
frame the bombing on.
(21) A Mossad agent
admits that, in 1984, Mossad
planted a radio transmitter in
Gaddaffi's compound in Tripoli,
Libya which broadcast fake
terrorist transmissions recorded
by Mossad, in order to frame
Gaddaffi as a terrorist
supporter.
Ronald Reagan bombed
Libya immediately thereafter.
(22) The South African
Truth and Reconciliation Council
found that, in 1989, the
Civil Cooperation Bureau (a
covert branch of the South
African Defense Force)
approached an explosives expert
and asked him,
"to participate in
an operation aimed at
discrediting the ANC [the
African National Congress] by
bombing the police vehicle of
the investigating officer into
the murder incident", thus
framing the ANC for the bombing.
(23) An Algerian
diplomat and several officers in
the Algerian army
admit that, in the 1990s,
the Algerian army frequently
massacred Algerian civilians and
then blamed Islamic militants
for the killings (and see
this video; and Agence
France-Presse, 9/27/2002, French
Court Dismisses Algerian
Defamation Suit Against Author).
(24) An Indonesian
fact-finding team investigated
violent riots which occurred in
1998, and
determined that,
"elements
of the military had been
involved in the riots, some of
which were deliberately provoked".
(25) Senior Russian
Senior military and intelligence
officers
admit that the KGB blew up
Russian apartment buildings in
1999 and falsely blamed it on
Chechens, in order to justify an
invasion of Chechnya (and see
this report and
this discussion).
(26) According to the
Washington Post, Indonesian
police admit that the Indonesian
military killed American
teachers in Papua in 2002 and
blamed the murders on a Papuan
separatist group in order to get
that group listed as a terrorist
organization.
(27) The well-respected
former Indonesian president also
admits that the government
probably had a role in the Bali
bombings.
(28) As reported by
BBC, the
New York Times, and
Associated Press, Macedonian
officials admit that the
government murdered 7 innocent
immigrants in cold blood and
pretended that they were Al
Qaeda soldiers attempting to
assassinate Macedonian police,
in order to join the "war on
terror".
(29) Senior police
officials in Genoa, Italy
admitted that - in July
2001, at the G8 summit in Genoa
- planted two Molotov cocktails
and faked the stabbing of a
police officer, in order to
justify a
violent crackdown against
protesters.
(30) Although the FBI
now admits that the 2001 anthrax
attacks were carried out by one
or more U.S. government
scientists, a senior FBI
official says that the FBI was
actually
told to blame the
Anthrax attacks on Al Qaeda
by White House officials
(remember what the anthrax
letters
looked like).
Government
officials also confirm that the
white House
tried to link the anthrax to
Iraq as a justification for
regime change in that country.
(31) Similarly, the U.S.
falsely blamed Iraq for
playing a role in the 9/11
attacks - as shown by a
memo from the defense secretary
- as one of the
main justifications for
launching the Iraq war.
Even
after the 9/11 Commission
admitted that there was no
connection,
Dick Cheney
said that
the evidence is
"overwhelming"
that al Qaeda had
a relationship with Saddam
Hussein's regime, that Cheney
"probably" had information
unavailable to the Commission,
and that the media was not
'doing their homework' in
reporting such ties.
Top U.S.
government officials now
admit that the Iraq war was
really launched for oil... not
9/11 or weapons of mass
destruction (despite previous
"lone wolf" claims, many U.S.
government officials now
say that 9/11 was
state-sponsored terror; but Iraq
was not the state which
backed the hijackers).
(32) Former Department
of Justice lawyer John Yoo
suggested in 2005 that the
US should go on the offensive
against al-Qaeda, having,
"our
intelligence agencies create a
false terrorist organization. It
could have its own websites,
recruitment centers, training
camps, and fundraising
operations.
It could launch fake
terrorist operations and claim
credit for real terrorist
strikes, helping to sow
confusion within al-Qaeda's
ranks, causing operatives to
doubt others' identities and to
question the validity of
communications."
(33) United Press
International
reported in June 2005:
U.S. intelligence officers
are reporting that some of
the insurgents in Iraq are
using recent-model Beretta
92 pistols, but the pistols
seem to have had their
serial numbers erased.
The
numbers do not appear to
have been physically
removed; the pistols seem to
have come off a production
line without any serial
numbers.
Analysts suggest
the lack of serial numbers
indicates that the weapons
were intended for
intelligence operations or
terrorist cells with
substantial government
backing. Analysts speculate
that these guns are probably
from either Mossad or the
CIA.
Analysts speculate that
agent provocateurs may be
using the untraceable
weapons even as U.S.
authorities use insurgent
attacks against civilians as
evidence of the illegitimacy
of the resistance.
(34) Undercover Israeli
soldiers
admitted in 2005 to throwing
stones at other Israeli soldiers
so they could blame it on
Palestinians, as an excuse to
crack down on peaceful protests
by the Palestinians.
(35) Quebec police
admitted that, in 2007,
thugs carrying rocks to a
peaceful protest were actually
undercover Quebec police
officers (and
see this).
(36) At the G20 protests
in London in 2009, a British
member of parliament
saw plain clothes police
officers attempting to incite
the crowd to violence.
(37) Egyptian
politicians
admitted (and
see this) that government
employees looted priceless
museum artifacts in 2011 to try
to discredit the protesters.
(38) A Colombian army
colonel has
admitted that his unit
murdered 57 civilians, then
dressed them in uniforms and
claimed they were rebels killed
in combat.
(39) The
highly-respected writer for the
Telegraph Ambrose
Evans-Pritchard says that the
head of Saudi intelligence -
Prince Bandar - recently
admitted that the Saudi
government controls "Chechen"
terrorists.
(40) High-level American
sources
admitted that the Turkish
government - a fellow NATO
country - carried out the
chemical weapons attacks blamed
on the Syrian government; and
high-ranking Turkish government
admitted on tape plans to
carry out attacks and blame it
on the Syrian government.
(41) The former
Ukrainian security chief
admits that the sniper
attacks which started the
Ukrainian coup were carried out
in order to frame others.
(42) Britain's spy
agency has
admitted (and
see this) that it carries
out "digital false flag" attacks
on targets,
framing people by writing
offensive or unlawful
material... and blaming it on
the target.
